<F P=106> [Report by Georgiy Bovt, Stanislav Tarasov under the "Russia </F>
in Conflict Settlement" rubric: "Azerbaijan May Be in for a 
Change of Power"] 
  [Excerpts] The latest events concerning the Karabakh 
conflict give grounds for drawing two mutually exclusive 
conclusions at one time: either the situation has finally spun 
out of the control of any of the conflicting parties, or it has 
been skillfully orchestrated by someone. One thing is clear: 
If the second theory is true, the movement is toward the 
ousting of the Aliyev regime in Baku. [passage omitted] 
  While hostilities were under way in Karabakh, equally 
curious 
events occurred in Moscow yesterday. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has 
learned that a delegation of representatives of the Azerbaijani 
opposition secretly came here to announce the creation of a 
Democratic Front and, subsequently, a coalition government or an 
emergency committee under former president Ayaz Mutalibov (who 
has been hiding from Aliyev in Moscow). Opposition members 
think that Azerbaijan is on the verge of collapse. According to 
their reports, 60 percent of the republic's territory is 
currently not controlled by the Baku regime, while Aliyev's main 
opponent, Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, has decided to wash his 
hands of it and has resigned. The opposition, however, plans to 
put forward their own proposals for overcoming the crisis -- by 
way of rapprochement with Russia -- and their options for the 
Karabakh crisis settlement within the framework of a general 
peace settlement in the Caucasus. 
  According to reports from Azerbaijani sources, Azerbaijan 
Foreign Minister Gasanov and Defense Minister Mamedov also 
stayed in Moscow yesterday on a secret mission. Presumably they 
were busy bargaining about their own political future in the 
event Aliyev is removed from office. Gyandzha's fall may well 
become a signal for the coup. So, Aliyev's fate is in the hands 
of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Or of Moscow.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 17, BNS -- Estonian Defense Police on 
Wednesday [16 March] formally brought charges against Pyotr 
Rozhok, the representative of Russian radical nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's misleadingly-named Liberal Democratic 
Party in Estonia. 
  Rozhok told BNS the charges brought against him were about 
fanning inter-ethnic hostility. Rozhok in his speech in Narva 
on Jan. 25 and in an interview with the Russian-language 
SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK local newspaper of the northeast Estonian 
town of Sillamae "fanned inter-ethnic and political hostility," 
the indictment says. 
  The representative of Zhirinovskiy's party at a meeting of 
the Narva Union of Russian citizens had said President Lennart 
Meri was a "president of the Estonians in the best case, not of 
Russians," because the country's Russian-speaking population had 
not participated in his election. He said the same of the 
Estonian parliament. 
  In an interview with the SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK Rozhok said 
Estonia is a traditional Russian domain. He said the retired 
Russian military living in Estonia should set up paramilitary 
units "for defending their honor and dignity" in the case if 
Estonian authorities decided to send them out from the country. 
  The indictment was read to Rozhok in the presence of a 
deputy 
consul of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn, Valeriy Chalovsky. 
  Rozhok said he has to sign a document on not leaving his 
permanent place of residence. He said he hasn't signed the 
paper yet. 
  Rozhok had told the police he was no more going to appear 
before police for interrogation. Security police officials had 
then said he would be brought before police under compulsion if 
necessary. 
  The Zhirinovskiy party representative last appeared before 
Estonian police for interrogation on March 10. Deputy Consul 
Chalovsky was also present then. 
  Rozhok on March 10 said he was not going to use the services 
of Estonian lawyers and added he had no intention to pay to any 
lawyer at all. "You yourselves have made up this soup, now you 
also eat it," he said in explanation. 
  Holger Siigart, deputy head of the Estonian Defense Police, 
said investigation into Rozhok's case was going to continue and 
that Rozhok will in any case have to appear before investigators 
to give his statements. Siigart also said the issue of the 
defense lawyer was going to be resolved, but he didn't elaborate.

  [Text] Tallinn, March 17 -- President Lennart Meri arrived 
from a visit to Ukraine on Thursday [17 March] and gave a news 
conference at the Tallinn airport. 
  On commenting his earlier visit to Israel, Meri recalled as 
most remarkable language-teaching to immigrants. It was 
interesting to see how in only six months a person virtually 
melts into the society, Meri said. Meri also said that after 
meetings with the president, prime minister, foreign minister 
and representatives of the Israeli parliament, he knows that 
Israel understands the tasks that lie ahead of Estonia. 
  On commenting on Ukraine, Meri said he thought the west 
often 
made a mistake in talking of the Baltic countries and former 
regions of the defunct Soviet Union. Ukraine is one of the 
biggest European countries, Meri said. We could see ourselves 
that gigantic economic reforms lie ahead of Ukraine and that the 
country intends to build a strong independent state which would 
be open to all countries of the world, he added.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 17, BNS -- Estonia is going to turn to 
the European Union [EU] for mediation in its talks with Moscow 
on the Russian troop withdrawal. 
  Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks with Russia, Vaino 
Reinart, began consultations on the issue in Brussels, a press 
release by the Estonian Foreign Ministry says. 
  The release issued today also says Estonia accepted Russia's 
proposal to hold the next round of talks in Moscow on Apr. 5-6, 
"despite a number of statements by Russian leaders, that are 
difficult to explain, on breaking off the negotiations and 
transfering the agreed final date for the withdrawal of troops." 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry reminds that at the past round 
of the talks held in the seaside resort of Lohusalu near 
Tallinn, "the Russian side refused to pull out its remaining 
2,600 troops from Estonia by the earlier agreed deadline -- Aug. 
31, 1994. The Russian representatives also moved forward new 
conditions for the troop withdrawal and did not propose a date 
for the next round" of talks, the statement says. 
  Estonia also says that a "quick and powerful" reaction from 
the West had influenced Russia to continue talks and abide by 
the troop withdrawal deadline.

Affairs in Tallinn: "Estonian Parliamentarians Meet 
Counterparts in Moscow Today; Discussion Centers on Borders, 
Legal Continuity of Estonia" -- received via Internet E-LIST] 
  [Text] March 17, 1994 -- Trivimi Velliste today explained 
to members of the Russian Parliament that the Tartu Peace 
Treaty, which determined the Estonian Russian border, is the 
only valid legal document on this matter. Velliste suggested 
that the deadlock on the border issue could be broken by moving 
that aspect of the Estonian-Russian negotiations into the 
framework of the European Stability Pact (Balladur Plan). 
  Velliste and Eino Tamm, both members of the Estonian 
Riigikogu's [parliament] Foreign Affairs Committee, are in 
Moscow at the invitation of the Russian Parliament's foreign 
relations committees to discuss the historic, legal, economic, 
social and other aspects of the Estonian-Russian border and 
border areas. Also participating in the debate were many 
Russian officials and representatives from oblasts and districts 
on the Estonian and Latvian borders. Among those speaking were 
Russian hard-liners from Narva, Vladimir Malkovski and Juri 
Mishin, former Interfront leader in Estonia, Yevgeni Kogan, and 
others. 
  The Russian officials and other representatives urged the 
Russian parliament to support unilateral demarcation by Russia 
of the current control line (essentially the same as the 
Estonian SSR-Russian border). Sections of Estonia in the 
southeastern corner of the country as well as territories east 
of Narva were illegally incorporated into the Russian SFSR by 
Stalin in 1944. Estonia is bound by its constitution to 
maintain the borders as set in 1920 by the Tartu Peace Treaty. 
  The Estonian and Russian parliamentarians agreed to continue 
contacts between the foreign relations committees.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 17, BNS -- The Estonian parliament on 
Wednesday [16 March] passed amendments to the law on the 
privatization of housing. 
  The amendments say the privatization voucher issued to 
Estonia's residents for their years of work may be transferred 
as a gift to the holder's parents, spouse, relatives in the 
descending line, sisters, brothers and their relatives, who are 
Estonian citizens or permanent residents of the country. 
  The law also gives the municipal and local commune 
governments the right to determine the houses that cannot be 
privatized because of plans to pull them down, their 
reconstruction, further use, or some other reason. The reason 
for the refusal must be made public. 
  Non-occupied housing premises can be privatized by Estonian 
residents of at least 18 years of age. The law says years of 
service in the KGB shall not be accounted in calculation of the 
length of employment in Estonia. 
  The parliament also approved an amendment to the tax 
regulations law, giving the government the right to extinguish 
debts of state companies going to privatization, or participate 
in management of the debts.

  [Text] Tallinn, March 17 -- An Estonian weekly must pay 
damages and apologize publicly for publishing a list of alleged 
KGB informers in five articles last spring, the Tallinn City 
Court ruled on Thursday [17 March]. 
  The court ruled the published data was false and the owner 
of 
the paper, AS Myyt, must in ten days apologize in the weekly 
"Eesti Aeg"( Estonian time) before the seven plaintiffs and play 
damages in the amount of 70,000 kroons ($5,000). 
  "Eesti Aeg" in its five issues last spring published the 
list 
of alleged KGB informers claiming the list had been found in a 
notebook of a KGB officer. 
  The list was quite lengthy, but only seven people decided to 
take legal action.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov under "Postscriptum: Events and </F>
Commentaries" rubric: "Final Summer in Jurmala. Russian and 
Latvian State Delegations Have Initialed a Treaty Under Which 
Russian Troops Will Quit Latvia Before 31 August 1994"] 
  [Text] Russia and Latvia have initialed a treaty on the 
terms, dates, and procedure for the full withdrawal of the 
Russian Federation Armed Forces from the territory of the 
Latvian Republic and on their legal status during the withdrawal 
period. It has been learned from the results of the talks in 
Moscow that this will take place before 31 August 1994. Sergey 
Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, called the initialing of 
the troop withdrawal treaty a "victory for common sense." 
  Apart from the treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops 
from Latvia, the sides also initialed three important agreements 
concerning, in particular, the legal status of the radar station 
at Skrunda, social protection for the Russian servicemen and 
their family members temporarily stationed on and now leaving 
the territory of the Latvian Republic, and also social 
protection for the Russian military pensioners and their family 
members remaining in Latvia. 
  Andrey Andreyev, the Russian delegation's executive 
secretary, explained to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that 
Russia will keep its radar station for four years, and an extra 
18 months will be set aside to dismantle it. But the question 
of rental for the radar station remained open. 
  In my view, the agreement on social protection for Russian 
servicemen and their family members should particularly single 
out aspects connected with housing. In particular, the Latvian 
side confirms the right of servicemen to sell apartments, to 
receive money for them, or to leave them to relatives or private 
persons: citizens or inhabitants of the Latvian Republic. 
  As for the agreement on social protection for military 
pensioners and their family members, the most important point in 
it is undoubtedly that the Latvian side has found the political 
will within itself and agreed to grant to all servicemen who 
transferred to the reserve before 28 January 1992 (the date the 
USSR Armed Forces stationed in Latvia passed to Russia's 
jurisdiction) the right to reside in the Latvian Republic 
without hindrance. 
  At the meeting which the two countries' delegations held it 
was confirmed in principle that they are prepared to sign a 
further eight interstate agreements. The sides will proceed 
from the premise that they can be signed in the event of a 
meeting between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the 
Latvian Republic. This could take place in the very near future.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 17, BNS -- Latvian Justice Minister Egils 
Levits said Thursday [17 March] at the Saeima [parliament] 
plenary meeting that the government would publish agreements, 
parafied during Latvian-Russian talks, in Friday's issue of the 
official newspaper LATVIJAS VESTNESIS. 
  Levits noted that the publication contradicts with the 
international regulations which do not provide for publication 
of agreements not yet signed. 
  The above mentioned announcement was made responding to 
Latvian National Independence Movement's (LNIM) claim that the 
Saeima must acquaint the deputies within 24 hours with all 
agreements parafied [as received] during interstate talks with 
Russia. 
  Latvian Way faction leader Andrejs Pantelejevs said at the 
plenary meeting he was surprised that Fatherland and Freedom, 
and LNIM factions have asked people to picket without even 
knowing the contents of the agreements. 
  After returning from the round of talks in Moscow, Latvian 
delegation head, Martins Virsis, said Tuesday at a press 
briefing that the agreements will be made accessible only after 
they will be discussed by the Latvian Government.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Startsev] </F>
  [Text] Rome March 17 TASS -- "A new page has been opened in 
our relations with Russia", Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs, currently on a visit to Italy, said assessing the 
agreement on Russian troop withdrawal from this Baltic state, 
which was initialled in Moscow on Tuesday. 
  "Time has not come yet to speak about a full success, but 
this agreement opens the way we would like to follow", Andrejevs 
said in an interview with TASS. "As far as possible, we heeded 
to pieces of advice from across the world, above all from the 
United States. We know that this compromise version was worked 
out at the Moscow summit between Presidents Boris Yeltsin and 
Bill Clinton. Then came our visit to Washington. During this 
visit, we received necessary explanations about why we should 
not be scared with this version", the minister noted. 
  Speaking about the Skrunda radar installation, which is to 
be 
kept by Russia for four years under the agreement, Andrejevs 
said: "Unfortunately, we have a bitter experience of 1993 
related to military bases stationed in Latvia. It was not very 
long ago, however we need to change Latvian people's mentality. 
We should explain that times have changed, and Russia needs the 
Skrunda radar only as a means of obtaining information and not 
as a military installation. This was the issue that caused the 
main difficulties. There is quite a strong opposition in Latvia 
which demands a complete withdrawal of Russian troops in 
accordance with the Helsinki agreement. Nevertheless, we should 
display political realism in our onward advance", the Latvian 
minister stressed. 
  In conclusion, Andrejevs expressed hope that a 
Russian-Latvian summit would take place as soon as in early 
April, and the drafted documents would be signed. "Relations 
between Russia and Latvia should be much better than both sides 
sometimes describe them. The truth is somewhere between, and we 
are quite able to develop friendly relations", the minister 
emphasised.

  [Text] [Announcer] On Thursday in the Saeima there was much 
discussion of the Latvian-Russian talks. At a news conference, 
Egils Levits, Latvian Way faction deputy and justice minister, 
described the situation: 
  [Begin Levits recording] I think it is a considerable 
achievement for Latvian diplomacy that in the given 
circumstances we have brought it about that by 31 August the 
Russian Army will withdraw from Latvia; that Russia has stuck 
firmly to this date in this way; that we are to be given back 
the two new buildings at the Skrunda radar station, which they 
have to vacate for us as soon as the treaty is signed; that we 
have kept up this pressure, and I could remind you that our 
southern neighbor, Lithuania, two years ago caved in and had to 
pay for it with the zero option -- so that all military 
personnel could stay in Lithuania. I do not see this as an 
achievement for the government, because it is not a government 
delegation, it is a Saeima delegation, and therefore, the 
co-authors of this achievement are also the LNNK [Latvian 
National Independence Movement] -- including Aleksandrs 
Kirsteins, the leader of the LNNK faction, who took part in 
these talks all the time. A co-author in this achievement is 
Deputy Juris Sinka of the Fatherland and Freedom, who took part 
in these talks all the time and in no sense deviated from the 
common standpoint of the delegation, and also in relation to our 
partner in the talks, Russia, subscribed to the common position, 
and therefore I do not ascribe this achievement only to the 
government, the Latvian Way, or the Peasants' Union, but I also 
congratulate the LNNK and the Fatherland and Freedom. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] In his turn, Aleksandrs Kirsteins, the head of 
the LNNK faction, emphasized at a news conference that the 
Russian Army is being withdrawn from Latvia not because of 
agreements on paper but thanks to a whole complex of regulations 
and agreements with the United States, the G7, the European 
Union countries, the United Nations, and the CSCE. As Kirsteins 
said, as long ago as 1992, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev announced that at the end of 1994 the troops will be 
withdrawn from the Baltic countries if the issue of some 
strategic bases was resolved.

of the Latvian-Russian interstate agreements, which were 
initialed March 14 in Moscow. 
  Under the agreements, Russia makes a commitment to get its

  [Text] Latvia demands that the Ostankino television company 
immediately pay its debt for the transmission of its TV programs 
in the republic. 
  At a meeting in Riga Thursday the Latvian Council for TV and 
Radio Broadcasting decided to notify Ostankino that if by April 
4 the debt for the 1st quarter is not repaid to Latvia, it will 
immediately consider cutting off the transmission of Ostankino 
TV programs on its territory. 
  So far, Ostankino has paid to the Latvian Council for TV and 
Radio Broadcasting only one third of the agreed amount. 
  Chairman of the Council Zigmunds Skujins said at the meeting 
that it is impossible to meet the demand of the second major 
faction of the Latvian parliament, the Movement for National 
Independence of Latvia, that the transmission of some Ostankino 
programs be stopped for political reasons.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the "Visit" rubric: "Bill </F>
Perry Begins Talks in Moscow. U.S. Defense Secretary To 
Encounter Problems in the CIS"] 
  [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry arrives in 
Moscow today. At 1130 he will meet with General Pavel Grachev. 
The visit is purely working in nature, which is why "no 
agreements will be signed during the visit in Moscow," Pavel 
Grachev said to your SEGODNYA correspondent. 
  William Perry will stay in Moscow for two days. He is 
scheduled to meet not only with Defense Ministry chiefs, but 
also with Oleg Soskovets, Andrey Kozyrev, and Ivan Rybkin. 
Perry will then leave for Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine, 
where he will continue his "fact-finding mission," as such 
voyages are usually termed in America. 
  The visit's working status will enable Perry to discuss a 
wide range of problems: the situation in Russia and Bosnia, the 
"Partnership for Peace," nuclear and chemical disarmament, 
nuclear weapons in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, flank quotas under 
the CFE Treaty, and the ABM Treaty. 
  Currently Russia does not have global differences in 
principle with the United States, but there is a multitude of 
minor problems that are hard to resolve. At present it is quite 
clear that cash- poor Russia needs assistance in order to 
fulfill its obligations with regard to nuclear and chemical 
weapons. Washington is in principle ready to pay, but it would 
like to be able to supervise the way the U.S. taxpayers' money 
is being spent. 
  Yesterday, U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and Russian 
Federation Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov managed to 
agree in Washington on giving inspectors access to the storage 
sites of the two countries' "nuclear warhead plutonium 
components." The Americans would also like directly to observe 
the process of the warheads' dismantlement (for the same amount 
of money), but Russian nuclear specialists would rather keep the 
secrets of "operational" warheads' specific design. 
  An even more difficult problem concerns flank quotas for 
heavy armaments under the CFE Treaty. In Georgia, Armenia, and 
in the North Caucasus there is currently more armored equipment 
than what is allowed by the Paris Treaty of 1990 and the 
Tashkent Protocol of 1992. The CFE Treaty is scheduled to go 
into force from the beginning of 1995; Russia insists that the 
limitations be renegotiated, whereas Turkey demands that they be 
adhered to without fail. Ankara has also expressed its 
willingness to send its peacekeeping troops under a UN flag to 
Abkhazia (at Georgia's request), something which Moscow, in 
turn, opposes. 
  Representatives of the Clinton administration have so far 
expressed their "sympathy and understanding" with regard to all 
conflicting sides in the CIS and around it. After holding 
intensive consultations in Moscow and other capitals, Bill Perry 
will apparently find much extra food for thought.

Gondusov] 
  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Russia may join the 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative as early as the end of March, 
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told journalists on 
Thursday after finishing a meeting with United States Secretary 
of Defence William Perry. 
  "The groups of experts are already finishing their study of 
Russia's approach to joining 'Partnership for Peace,'" Grachev 
pointed out. "Basing our approach on Russia's particular needs, 
we will be ready to join the initiative already by the end of 
the month", he reported. The public will soon be able to have a 
look at the fundamental propositions of Russia's relationship 
with the partnership programme, he stated. 
  ITAR-TASS asked the defence ministers to comment on reports 
that the Pentagon in the near future intends to approve the 
allocation of funds to Russian and American corporations which 
will specialize in constructing housing for military personnel 
transferred to the reserves and in converting military 
enterprises to civilian production. 
  The American Defence Secretary announced that he would be 
discussing this topic with his Russian colleagues on Thursday 
and Friday. These talks should lead to the implementation of a 
joint programme which should require 60 to 100 million dollars 
in the next year, Perry said. 
  The defence secretary stated that his talks with Grachev 
focused on three global problems. First, the two sides had a 
good, positive discussion about the deepening of their working 
relations. Second, the partnership for peace initiative was 
discussed. Third, they discussed ways of improving 
Russian-American cooperation in Bosnia in order to speed up the 
peace process in that region, Perry explained. 
  During their discussion of the Bosnian question, the two 
sides agreed to cooperate as equal partners, he said. 
  The aim of their cooperation in bosnia is the continuation 
of 
talks with the Muslims, Croatians, and Bosnians in order to 
hasten the development of a peace agreement for the region, 
Perry said. Such an agreement would be in the interests of the 
United States, Russia, and all the countries in southeastern 
Europe. 
  Both ministers emphasized the importance of relations 
between 
their two departments in determining the character of relations 
between their respective countries. That is why a lot of 
attention during the meeting was paid to personal contacts 
between representatives of the two ministries, they said.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaly Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Russia must be among the first and vigorous 
participants of partnership with NATO, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev said in response to an Interfax question 
following his meeting with Secretary of Defense William Perry. 
  Kozyrev quoted Perry as saying that all countries willing to 
join NATO's Partnership for Peace program were equal. "It is 
also obvious, however, that Russia is a great power with its own 
interests. It would be strange if we were late arrivals," 
Kozyrev said meaning Partnership for Peace. 
  He said that the Russo-American cooperation must be equal, 
mutually beneficial and have clear cut goals. 
  "Pragmatism and usefulness must be the all-important 
factors. 
We should not be guided by ideological cliches. Like in a 
family, there are issues in the Russo-American relations which 
call for close coordination while in other fields every member 
of the family acts on his own trying not to harm the common 
interests," Kozyrev explained. He emphasized that neither the 
Russian nor the U.S. leaders intended to give up cooperation or 
partnership. 
  Answering another Interfax question, Kozyrev said that he 
had 
talked with Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the phone 
to discuss numerous international issues, notably the Middle 
East. He added that the UN Security Council would discuss a 
resolution on the Middle East Friday. 
  "This resolution must be passed urgently. The delay of its 
adoption hinders the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli talks," 
Kozyrev said. He emphasized that if the resolution were adopted 
Friday, Russian president's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk 
would go to Tunis to discuss with the PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
the specific day when the talks would resume. 
  Kozyrev said that the delay also provoked new tragedies and 
casualties in the Middle East. "It is important that the 
confrontation mechanism should not be allowed to gain momentum," 
he said. 
  He had also discussed Bosnia and Herzegovina with 
Christopher. "I expressed my view and the U.S. secretary of 
State agreed with it, that the Bosnian Moslems and Croats who 
intend to sign an agreement in Washington on March 18 on the 
setting up a federation should use this agreement as a tool for 
rapprochement and compromises with the third party, the Bosnian 
Serbs, rather than for opposing them jointly," Kozyrev said. He 
explained that Moscow would like to know if the federation was 
consistent with territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  "We hope that this agreement will be a step forward. But 
even at this point it is important to know what the next steps 
will be and how the Bosnian Serbs will be incorporated into it," 
Kozyrev said.

Russia and America are entering a new phase of their 
relationship. Their speeches noted that the talk should now be 
not only about future prospects but also about specific ways to 
implement the conversion of Russia's defense complex. 
  The American side showed an interest in assisting Russia's 
conversion plans, not just with advice but also with hundreds of 
millions of dollars. In particular, William Perry emphasized 
the wish of the Americans to organize in Russia the manufacture 
of prefabricated housing for servicemen's families, and noted 
the mutual benefit of cooperation between the two countries on 
this issue.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein article: "Military Bridge Between Two </F>
Superpowers. The U.S. Defense Secretary Begins a Tour of 
Countries of the Former USSR"] 
  [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has called the 
present relationship between his country and Russia a "difficult 
love affair." Speaking in George Washington University two days 
before his trip to Russia, Kazakhstan, Belorussia [Belarus], and 
Ukraine, the American certainly could not have known that at 
roughly the same time, on the other side of the world, Russian 
Foreign Minister V. Kozyrev had resorted to words relating to 
the same feelings, having notified everyone both of the end of 
the honeymoon in the Russian-U.S. relationship and of the 
continuation of this promising marriage. 
  "Russia is our partner and our rival, at one and the same 
time," W. Perry said. "We must be aware that our relationship 
contains elements of both." 
  Since the declarations of passionate love have cooled a 
little following the capture of CIA staffer Ames, who from 1985 
allegedly worked for the USSR and then for Russia, it was 
psychologically easy for the defense secretary to speak of a 
smooth revision of the line of his predecessor Les Aspin, who 
said only a few months ago that "the Russian military threat is 
disappearing and it does not seem that it will be revived." 
<H5>  Two Options, One Result </H5>
  Perry outlined two probabilities in Russia's development. 
  "Reality No. 1 is that, even given the very best of the 
imaginable outcomes in Russia today, i.e. given a fully 
democratic and market-oriented Russia, this new Russia will have 
interests different from ours," the defense secretary said. 
"Even with our allies like France and Japan we have rivalry and 
competition in addition to our cooperation, and this will be the 
case with Russia." 
  "Reality No. 2 is the very worst of the possible outcomes, 
and we must be prepared for it. It is possible that Russia will 
emerge from its uneasy times as an autocratic, militarist, 
imperialist state hostile to the West. In such a situation we 
will truly be witnesses to the revival of something like the 
Cold War, and Russia, even without the Warsaw Pact, will remain 
an impressive nuclear arsenal." 
  In this event the secretary proposed erecting "fences" 
consisting of the following measures. First, the U.S. military 
budget, which has been subjected to cuts in the recent past, 
remains immutable for the immediate future. Second, U.S. 
nuclear weapons are improved and developed, including in the 
sphere of theoretical scientific development. Third, the 
program for building the submarine strike fleet is expanded, 
above all by means of the most modern Seawolf-class submarines. 
Fourth, special attention is devoted to improving U.S. tanks. 
  Responding to numerous critics inside the country, who 
accuse 
the present administration of making concessions to Russia on 
the one hand and of jostling it into a tight corner on the 
other, the defense secretary called the contrast between the two 
countries' rivalry and cooperation a "false dilemma." He 
acknowledged Russia's participation in the Bosnian crisis as 
highly valuable. 
<H5>  With His Own Eyes </H5>
  The secretary said that an important part of his visit to 
Moscow, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Kiev, and Minsk will be the fact that 
he will be able to assure himself with his own eyes that the 
U.S. taxpayers' money is working in favor of U.S. national 
interests. 
  Speaking of the Nunn-Lugar program, so named for the 
senators who initiated the allocation of money for the 
destruction of the former Soviet nuclear missile arsenal, the 
secretary said that this is one of the least expensive ABM 
defense methods, since the threat is destroyed not in space but 
while still on the ground. 
  In Ukraine Perry will observe the process of dismantling 
ICBM's and sending them to Russia. In Belorussia he will see 
how the former nuclear missile weapon bases are being 
transformed. In Kazakhstan he will discuss with Kazakhs and 
Russians the likelihood of the joint use of Baykonur Cosmodrome 
for the commercial launching of rockets. 
  Although the defense secretary's speech was clearly meant 
for 
home consumption -- which is why it abounded with the 
terminology of "national interests" -- it was imbued not only 
with knowledge of Russia but also with unconcealed respect for 
its military men. 
  It is not just that Perry called Russia's military men the 
force on which the country's future largely depends. All his 
views exuded awareness of the fact that military associations, 
which represent an important part of the culture and the 
political milieu of both countries, can create an important 
channel of communication between the two countries. 
  Speaking of the telephone hot line and of the two telephones 
which stand on his desk and on that of Russian Defense Minister 
P. Grachev, Perry emphasized that professional misunderstandings 
have not yet arisen between the two commands. 
  Perry cited the upcoming joint maneuvers by peacekeeping 
forces as an example of the unusually quick development of 
mutual understanding between the two countries' defense 
ministries. Servicemen of the U.S. Army's 3d Infantry Division 
and the 27th Motorized Rifle Guards' Division will hold joint 
exercises this summer on the banks of the Volga. 
  Although problems of the reduction of nuclear arsenals and 
the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons predominate on Perry's 
agenda, he intends to discuss in detail in talks with colleagues 
questions of U.S. financial assistance in the conversion of 
large enterprises. 
  William Perry is not a professional military man. He is a 
scientist and a researcher who has worked for long years in 
spheres connected with the military industry. Although he has 
ruled out the likelihood of contacts with extreme forces in 
present-day Russian political life, he intends to hold intensive 
talks not only with President B.N. Yeltsin's staffers and not 
only at the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense but also 
with the leaders of the Duma and the Federal Assembly.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "Russia-United States: Military </F>
Cooperation Is Better Than `Cold' Peace"] 
  [Excerpts] A new concept, that of "cold" peace, has 
appeared in our political science lexicon recently. In the 
opinion of certain Western politicians, the present states of 
relations between Russia and the United States is characterized 
by this term. The "Cold" War and open military confrontation 
have ended.... Both sides have been expressing seemingly very 
appealing and correct slogans about cooperation, but in 
practice.... Furthermore, it is practice which shows that 
fundamentally new relations -- businesslike relations befitting 
partners who respect one another -- are taking shape between the 
two great powers. Relations which are imbued not by coldness but 
by professionalism, undoubtedly without the initial euphoria 
which marked the breakthrough of the 90's. 
  Perhaps this is why U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's 
first visit to Russia is a working visit. And the questions he 
has come to discuss in our country are not those typical of 
grand ceremonies but are of the most everyday type, requiring 
mutual efforts to resolve them. The plane bringing Secretary 
Perry did not touch down at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport until 
1000 hours on 17 March, but within 90 minutes the head of the 
Pentagon was already being received by Army General Pavel 
Grachev, Russia's defense minister. 
  The very first phrases which the leaders of the two 
countries' defense departments exchanged confirmed that they are 
both clearly aware that, to a very large extent, mutual 
relations between the defense ministries and the defense 
ministers themselves determine the overall climate of interstate 
relations between Russia and the United States. Security 
problems have been crucial in this sphere too long for them to 
be simply swept aside at a stroke. Now, as William Perry 
himself showed by what he said when addressing students and 
staff at George Washington University four days ago, ruling 
circles in the United States are still prey to the fear that 
Russia may revert to the path of an "authoritarian, militarist, 
imperialist power, hostile to the West." 
  It may be said here and now that these are groundless 
inventions, but it can also be acknowledged that the Americans 
do not rule out such a possibility -- and consequently they are 
taking the corresponding preemptive measures. But the aims of 
the U.S. Defense Secretary's visit include not just a desire to 
convince himself of the sincerity of our country's peace-loving 
course but also to discuss joint efforts in the sphere of the 
conversion of defense production and progress in the elimination 
of that part of the former USSR's nuclear arsenal that is due to 
be scrapped (these questions will also be raised during his trip 
to Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belorussia [Belarus]). [passage 
omitted] 
  The very first talks in Russia, according to the U.S. guest, 
were satisfactory to both sides. As Army Gen. Pavel Grachev 
said at a brief meeting with journalists after the general talks 
and after a one-on-one conversation lasting almost 30 minutes, 
there was a significant coincidence of views on questions of 
bilateral ties, on the prospects for Russia's participation in 
the "Partnership for Peace" program, and on the Bosnian problem. 
Incidentally, Russia will be ready to sign the agreement on 
affiliating to the "Partnership for Peace" program as early as 
the end of March when the experts have completed their study of 
the necessary documents, the Russian Federation defense minister 
announced. 
  That same day William Perry had meetings and talks with 
Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy defense 
minister, and Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the 
Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff. On day two of 
the visit the head of the Pentagon will be received by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, premier of the Russian Government.

  [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- Russia goes to accession to 
NATO's Partnership for Peace programme "consciously. We do not 
set any pre-conditions. I do not think this is a renunciation 
of our position," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
told journalists at the close of his talks with U.S. Secretary 
of Defence William Perry on Friday morning. 
  The two countries' cooperation in the conversion of the 
Russian Defence Ministry to civilan production and matters 
connected with nuclear disarmament, including that of Ukraine, 
were discussd, Chernomyrdin said. 
  Mr Perry pointed out that Russia would declare its joining 
NATO's Partnership for Peace programme at the end of March. 
"This will be a major event in NATO", because its programme will 
be virtually realised, he said, adding that "Russia is a great 
nuclear power and it will play a very special role in the 
Partnership for Peace". 
  The supply of technology to Russia for the manufacture of 
prefabricated houses for servicemen and for the elimination of 
chemical weapons was also discussed during the talks with the 
U.S. defence secretary, Chernomyrdin said. "We have approached 
closely the problem of eliminating biological weapons as well," 
the premier noted. 
  Chernomyrdin called for more active cooperation between the 
two countries under the auspices of the Russian-U.S. Economic, 
Scientific and Technical Cooperation Commission which is 
co-chaired by the Russian premier and U.S. Vice-President Albert 
Gore. The premier said the commission's regular session is to 
be held in the U.S. in May.

<F P=106> [By ITAR TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 17 Mar -- The decision by the U.S. President 
to prolong the nuclear test moratorium for another year, up to 
September 1995, has been met with satisfaction in Russia. This 
was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of 
the department of information and the press of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry. 
  He stressed that Russia's position on this question remained 
unchanged. We were the initiators of the trilateral moratorium 
on nuclear tests, which is being observed de facto by Britain, 
too, and we recently stated once again our intention of 
continuing to adhere to it. At the same time we called on the 
other nuclear countries to do the same, the spokesman of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry stated. 
  In connection with this, he recalled that during the 
Russian-U.S. summit meeting in Moscow, Presidents Boris Yeltsin 
and Bill Clinton confirmed Russia's and the U.S. commitment to 
achieving within a very short period an international treaty on 
the total banning of nuclear tests. Karasin also noted the 
constructive atmosphere at the talks on this question, which are 
taking place at the disarmament conference in Geneva.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Shalnev: "You Can Go to America for </F>
Good Even Without Spending $100"] 
  [Text] Back at the beginning of February the American 
Embassy in Moscow made a brief announcement: As of 1 October 
this year the U.S. Government will start holding a lottery, the 
winners of which will receive not money, but green cards -- 
documents entitling them to take up permanent residence and to 
work on the other side of the Atlantic. Such lotteries are not 
new, they have been held for several years now, but it is the 
first time Russians and inhabitants of other countries of the 
former Union will be able to participate. 
  The lotteries are intended to enable people who do not meet 
the normal requirements for the issuing of a green card to 
settle in America. If, say, you do not have close relatives in 
the United States or there is no employer who is prepared to 
take full responsibility for you and assure the U.S. immigration 
authorities that unless you, a unique professional, are given 
work in America America's prosperity will suffer badly as a 
result. 
  Judging by information from the embassy, the process of 
receiving applications to participate in the lottery will begin 
in the spring. You will not have to fill in any form, all you 
will have to do is make a written application and send it to the 
appointed address. 
  The embassy issued another notice: "There will be no need to 
pay any intermediary for assistance in framing an application. 
Paying for such services will not improve the applicant's 
chances of success." 
  The other day it was confirmed for me at the embassy that no 
additional information has been issued since the February 
notification. In other words, the details are still being 
worked out and coordinated. Just wait. 
  But the intermediaries are already buzzing around all over 
the place. Some made a practical suggestion to the editorial 
boards of newspapers in the capital, including IZVESTIYA: Act 
as an agent for a U.S. law firm, help us distribute forms, and 
then we can share the proceeds. 
  They even sent us a copy of the form which lottery 
participants would be expected to fill in and which would then 
be passed on to the U.S. law firm for it to deliver to U.S. 
territory and register by a certain date. 
  What would the law firm charge for its services? $100 a 
head. The explanatory letter says that "families will double 
their chances if husband and wife fill in separate forms." That 
makes $200. 
  It appears that the U.S. law firm is operating entirely at 
the potential lottery participants' risk. And, of course, it is 
trying to make money, big money. Money out of our fellow 
citizens' ignorance and ingenuousness. 
  I talked on the telephone with those who, as it were, 
represent the firm's interests in Moscow. I tried to ascertain, 
in particular, the credentials of this firm, which has been set 
up in California by people who were compatriots of ours not long 
ago. Alas, my questions about its successes remained unanswered. 
  The interesting thing is, though, that Russian citizens will 
find it hard to do without the services of intermediaries. 
Judging by the experience of past lotteries, the U.S. 
authorities would like to "eliminate" as many applicants as 
possible and prevent them from participating in the lottery. 
And it will be very easy to do this, I was told: Either the 
application would be declared void on the pretext of some 
inaccuracy and thrown in the bin or it would take so long to get 
to the United States that it would fail to meet the deadline. 
The firm will be accurate and prompt. 
  "Is it true, as the American Embassy says, that the efforts 
of intermediaries will not improve the chances of success?" 
  "It is true," came the reply. "It is a lottery, after all." 
  Anyway, I personally would not be in too much of a hurry to 
hand over my greenbacks. At least until the U.S. immigration 
service has dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's, in 
particular on the question whether it is indeed possible to try 
one's luck in the lottery without intermediaries.

<F P=106> [Vassan Georgiyev commentary] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister of Pakistan Asif Ahmad Ali has 
charged the United States with supplying outdated weapons to the 
UN peacekeeping force in Somalia. Together with his country's 
Defense Minister, Asif Ahmad Ali visited Somalia to inspect the 
Pakistani contingent of the UN force. Now our commentary by 
Vassan Georgiyev: 
  The United States and the other Western countries want to 
withdraw their troops from Somalia by the end of this month. 
The UN force remaining in Somalia will consist of troops of 
Afro-Asian countries only. The Pakistani contingent will be the 
largest, more than 5,000 people. As the Pakistani foreign 
minister says, the United Nations troops remaining in Somalia 
would be left with outdated weapons, the Cobra helicopters, 
which have served their time, old models of tanks, and other 
military equipment. Asif Ahmad Ali also called attention to the 
shortage of drugs and dressings. The Pakistani foreign minister 
described as racist such an approach to the United Nations 
peacekeepers staying in Somalia. He accused the United States 
of contempt of the lives and health of servicemen from Pakistan 
and other states of Asia and Africa.The racism charges were 
immediately rejected by the United States Defense Department and 
Washington agreed to consider the issue of replacing outdated 
weapons. 
  At this point one may consider the matter settled. Yet one 
might consider at the same time whether out-of-date weapons were 
the only source of the Pakistani foreign minister's irritation. 
Until recently, as it received large amounts of weapons from 
the United States, Islamabad could hardly afford to criticize 
the Pentagon publicly. Yet the United States embargo on arms 
shipments to Pakistan following its attempts to create a nuclear 
bomb of its own, has changed Islamabad's policy toward 
Washington. It should not be ruled out that as he criticizes 
Washington for leaving outdated military equipment for the 
Pakistani contingent in Somalia, the foreign minister of 
Pakistan wants to remind Washington of the problem of his 
country's army in general; it is no secret that it is still 
equipped largely with American weapons but these weapons were 
manufactured in the '70s. Islamabad wants the United States to 
resume military aid to Pakistan, including the F-16 fighter 
bombers and other latest weapons. It appears that the foreign 
minister of Pakistan took advantage of the participation of the 
country's contingent in the United Nations peacekeeping forces 
to remind Washington of the needs of the Pakistani Army once 
again.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Vernikov report: "Kremlin and Smolensk Square </F>
Keep a Secret Known to Spanish Journalists and Doctors"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- If we are to believe the Russian 
president's press spokesman, as reported by the newspaper EL 
PAIS, Boris Yeltsin is not going to undergo a medical 
examination at the Barcelona clinic where he had a spinal 
operation in 1990 following a bad plane landing. 
  Although, in the same newspaper's words, a brief stay in 
Barcelona is envisaged by the program for the president's 
upcoming official visit to Spain. But what visit are we talking 
about, since there has been no official announcement in the 
Russian press? And so naturally he cannot be going to 
Barcelona, where, according to the Western press, our president 
is to be examined for pain in the area of the disk he had 
operated on. 
  So why is it that the Spanish newspapers are not only citing 
the dates of the visit -- 11-13 April -- and the list of 
documents to be signed in Madrid but are also discussing them, 
whereas the Russian Foreign Ministry and the presidential press 
service are keeping silent about the matter, confining 
themselves to denials on detail while not acknowledging the 
actual fact of the visit and its purposes? The information 
about a Boris Yeltsin visit is not repudiated but rather 
confirmed by official Spanish Government spokesmen, who are 
preparing for the visit in earnest. 
  Surely Moscow has not reverted to the say-nothing tactics of 
old, when people would learn of a visit by the latest general 
secretary at the moment he was taking off or even the following 
day? 
  The Russian Embassy in Spain has also been placed in a 
stupid 
and absurd position: Politicians and journalists are calling, 
asking questions, and demanding interviews, but our diplomats, 
being disciplined people, since they have not received orders 
from Moscow, are "giving evasive answers" while inwardly feeling 
uncomfortable at the need to lie to respected people. 
  In fact they all are perfectly well aware of both the 
precise 
date and the program of the visit -- they themselves agreed it 
with the Spanish authorities, and the "advance party" called 
upon to support the visit is already in Moscow. 
  But since there have been no orders from the chiefs, there 
is 
no visit and "I cannot tell anyone anything." Nowadays this 
game of secrecy is ridiculous, there is barely any sense in it 
and it provides plenty of opportunity for false rumors. 
  For instance, EL PAIS writes that one of the purposes of the 
visit is the Russian president's desire to "make a deeper study 
on the spot of the essence of the so-called Moncloa Pact," which 
facilitated the peaceful transition from Francoism to democracy. 
Or, for instance, it is reported, citing the Barcelona doctor 
who operated on Boris Yeltsin, that he has now received a call 
from Moscow and has been warned that he will soon be seeing his 
former patient. 
  Especially as the doctor has already been brought to Moscow 
in the president's aircraft for a consultation. Who then is to 
be believed: the doctor or the president's press spokesman?

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent andrey Naryshkin] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb, 17 Mar -- The scheduled holding of 
Croatian-Serbian talks on 22 March at the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb is no surprise for the Croatian side. Russian special 
presidential representative Vitaliy Churkin told journalists 
this after his consultations on Wednesday [16 March] evening 
with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. "We had previously been 
studying with President Tudjman and other Croatian officials the 
matter of the meeting that has been announced. It was therefore 
nothing unexpected for him," V. Churkin said. In his opinion, 
it is necessary next week above all to sign a document on 
ceasing hostile actions, which would guarantee the 
non-resumption of conflicts in and around the areas of Croatia 
that are under UN control. 
  "Recently we have been working really hard to make it 
possible. Agreement in principle to sign such a treaty was 
reached previously, but it did not happen for reasons of a 
political and emotional character," V. Churkin noted. "The 
Croatian side is ready for a dialogue and will take part in the 
talks at the Russian Embassy," Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, the Croatin 
president's press assistant, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
today. 
  Meanwhile, the ITAR-TASS correspondent learned today from 
well- informed diplomatic sources in Zagreb, that by no means 
all the obstacles capable of preventing the signing of the 
document next Tuesday have yet been removed. V. Churkin will 
continue discussion of the problems of the Croatian territories 
under UN control in Washington, for which he left by air this 
morning.

  [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS [dateline as received] -- 
"There are good grounds for the ratification of treaty of the 
friendly relations between Russia and Czechia," Jiri Pein, the 
chairman of the foreign relations committee of the chamber of 
deputies of the Czech Republic, told ITAR-TASS upon the 
conclusion of a visit of a parliamentary delegation of the Czech 
Republic to Moscow. He said the Russian side promised to speed 
up the ratification of the treaty which is of much importance 
for creating the legal grounds for cooperation between Russia 
and Czechia. 
  The Czech parliamentarian said that meetings with leaders of 
the Russian State Duma and Federation Council, with 
representatives of the Russian Foreign Ministry and of Russian 
political parties indicated that changes had taken place in the 
Russian foreign policy. During meetings and conversations that 
the Czech parliamentary delegation had in Moscow the sides were 
not striving to convince each other of anything. They only 
exchanged opinions on matters of mutual interest, specifically, 
the attitude to the "Partnership for Peace", European security 
and prospects for economic cooperation. "We got convinced that 
Russia respects Czechia's sovereignty", Jiri Pein said.

<F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Yelagin and Valentin Ovsyannikov: </F>
"`Synchronizing Watches' in the Skyscraper on Smolensk Square"] 
  [Text] The enlarged session of the Russian Federation 
Foreign Ministry Foreign Policy Council involving eminent 
Russian political scientists and parliamentarians has rapidly 
become a feature of the Russian diplomatic department's 
activity. This shows that it is not screened off from its 
opponents by an "iron curtain of secrecy" even if they do say 
unpleasant things to the occupants of the "Smolensk Square 
skyscraper [Russian Foreign Ministry Building]." On this 
occasion the session was dedicated to the topical theme of 
"Problems of the formation of a Pan-European security system and 
relations between Russia and NATO." 
  The posing of this problem by the Russian Foreign Ministry, 
it seems, is due to the existence of different conceptual 
approaches both in the East and the West to the formation of a 
pan-European security system in the context of the possible 
expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance. Russian international 
affairs experts, like their Western counterparts, have differing 
approaches to the problem of mutual relations between Russia and 
NATO. Thus the Foreign Ministry, it seems, has decided to 
"synchronize watches" and listen to the informed opinion of 
leading representatives of Russian political science and 
well-known Russian deputies engaged on foreign policy questions. 
  As usual the council session was addressed by A. Kozyrev, a 
fact which undoubtedly lent significance to the theme under 
discussion. In particular, the foreign minister advocated that 
the military, military-political, and military-industrial 
machines created in the period of confrontation be reformed into 
instruments of stability, security, and even cooperation between 
East and West. This is viewed as a real and practical path 
toward ensuring that the former enemies not only see one another 
as friends and allies but also arrive at the idea of the 
deepening and institutionalization of cooperation with NATO, 
which has been embodied in the concept "Partnership for Peace." 
Today, Russia is close to signing the corresponding agreements 
but, as the head of the Russian foreign policy department 
hinted, that will take at least 2-3 years. 
  It emerges from the minister's speech that both he and his 
colleagues have not lost faith in the qualitative strengthening 
of the CSCE during the new all-European summit in December this 
year. But that will require resolute actions in the security 
sphere within the framework of NATO, the EU, the Western 
European Union, and the CIS. Such an approach is most unlike 
Russia's diktat or veto toward the states of central and Eastern 
Europe and NATO. 
  It is also symptomatic that the head of Russian diplomacy 
could not ignore the "Zhirinovskiy factor." He uncompromisingly 
rejected the attempts by certain circles in the West and in 
central and Eastern Europe to exploit that factor and also the 
intentions to attribute an enemy image to Russia because the 
artificially created thesis of the Russian threat prevents 
people from seeing the real security problems. 
  It was stressed in particular that "Partnership for Peace" 
is 
not the finished article but merely a pattern for 
military-political cooperation. Victory in the Cold War, the 
minister stated, went not to NATO's military machine but to the 
democratic principles of the CSCE. This assessment of the 
CSCE's role deserves the utmost attention although different 
opinions exist in certain circles in the West, as is well known. 
Clearly, the different approaches should not lead to the 
division of Europe into opposing alliances and spheres of 
influence. 
  This speech was marked by its straightforwardness. A. 
Kozyrev did not resort to trickery and honestly set out the 
Russian position on the formation of a security system in 
Europe. But Moscow's efforts alone will clearly not be enough. 
There must be a cooperative approach from other states and the 
world community. A. Kozyrev's frank discussion with W. 
Christopher, his U.S. counterpart, in Vladivostok will make it 
clear whether such an approach is forthcoming. 
  Predictably enough, the minister's speech provoked a keen 
debate, which revealed quite a wide spread of opinions, ranging 
from agreement to accept the invitation to share NATO's 
"Partnership for Peace" concept and work with NATO on parallel 
courses, on the one hand, to pessimistic predictions on the idea 
of deepening cooperation with NATO on the other. But even the 
supporters of the first approach, and they formed the majority, 
had to acknowledge that although the North Atlantic bloc remains 
an important factor in the preservation of military-political 
stability in Europe it is nevertheless a rudiment of the Cold 
War and thus needs to be transformed itself. 
  One path for the alliance's evolution is to merge into the 
pan-European security structure, first and foremost under the 
auspices of the CSCE and the United Nations. But even here the 
viewpoints differed. Some political scientists did not rate 
highly the potential of the CSCE as a universal pan-European 
forum. The UN's rating was higher. There were also appeals to 
revive the UN military staff committee for the leadership of 
international peacemaking operations. 
  On the whole there were quite a few well argued appeals to 
the effect that broader account should be taken of the opinion 
of the people's masses when carrying out various foreign policy 
actions. For example, a warning was expressed that the 
unification of the central and East European countries and NATO 
will upset the existing balance of security and lead to a growth 
in nationalist feelings within Russian society. The reasons: 
The old stereotyped perceptions of the West and NATO are still 
strong in Russia. 
  It was also noted that Russia must reinforce its image as a 
democratic state which enjoys the reputation of being a reliable 
partner and must destroy the anti-Russian psychological complex 
which is entrenched in Eastern Europe by means of establishing 
relations of a new type based on trust and good-neighborliness. 
  A special place in the discussion was occupied by questions 
of defining the optimum forms of combining national priorities 
and collective principles in the formation of the pan-European 
security system which takes into account Russia's specific 
interests in European affairs. It was pointed out that 
cooperation between Russia and NATO must be carried out on a 
mutually beneficial and equitable basis and the Russian 
"Partnership" program must correspond as much as possible to the 
vital interests of our national security. It was proposed that 
contacts with NATO be strengthened by the signing of agreements 
on various aspects of international security, as happened in the 
days of the former USSR, and by building up bilateral 
cooperation with leading Western states. 
  Considerable attention was paid to the problems of involving 
our CIS partners in the efforts aimed at forming a European 
security system and to the effect that Russia's involvement in 
the "Partnership" program would have on centripetal processes 
within the Commonwealth itself. The idea was expressed that by 
joining NATO Russia will not lose its leading role in the CIS. 
Thus, prior to unification there should be a preliminary 
consultation with the CIS members. It was also said that Russia 
must take a more active part in resolving CIS problems, which 
would strengthen its role as guarantor on the territory of the 
CIS. But for that, as one speaker figuratively put it, it is 
necessary "not to bark but to bite." In other words, less talk, 
more action. 
  Individual political scientists put forward highly 
disturbing 
predictions about the future character of the development of our 
relations with China and other eastern neighbors after Russia 
affiliates to the "Partnership" concept. 
  It was also said that people should "come back down to 
earth" 
and see that the development of events in Europe is being formed 
under the influence of geopolitical interests which do not 
presuppose Russia's smooth entry into Europe. Moreover, there 
is a clear tendency toward "forcing" Russian out of the European 
area. NATO's expansion by means of the countries of central and 
Eastern Europe will inevitably lead to the isolation and 
weakening of Russia. 
  There were proposals on measures to curb the process of the 
admission of the central and Eastern European countries into 
NATO. For that, it was said, Russia should constantly remind 
people of its desire to become a full-fledged member of NATO. 
But since that is hardly likely to happen the Eastward 
expansion of the alliance will automatically stop. 
  Some of the political scientists tended to the view that 
Russia's affiliation to the "Partnership for Peace" concept must 
be carried out circumspectly because this could harm the Russian 
military-industrial complex and lead to the loss of arms sales 
markets. They spoke skeptically about Russia's participation in 
the transformation of the North Atlantic alliance because "we 
are the guests there, not the hosts." On the whole the Foreign 
Policy Council session confirmed the importance of a joint and 
constructive exchange of opinions among diplomats, scientists, 
parliamentarians, and other representatives of political and 
public circles on the most topical problems of Russian foreign 
policy. It may be said without exaggeration that the discussion 
was extraordinarily useful and was directly conducive to 
achieving a democratic consensus on approaches to current 
international problems.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Belorussia [Belarus] Gives Up </F>
Strategic Nuclear Systems Forever. Now Only Russia Will Have 
Them"] 
  [Text] The full-scale withdrawal from Belorussian 
territory to Russia of the Strategic Rocket Forces grouping 
temporarily stationed in the cities of Mozyr and Lida has begun. 
IZVESTIYA's military correspondent learned this from 
well-informed sources in the Russian Defense Ministry. 
  The Strategic Rocket Forces grouping in the Republic of 
Belorussia comprised two divisions (eight missile regiments) 
armed with the RS-12M "Topol" road-mobile missile system or, as 
it was called in the West, the SS-25. A total of 72 launchers. 
  The first regiment (nine "Topols") stationed in Postavy was 
withdrawn to Russia back in summer 1993. The next four 
regiments (36 launchers) will leave the republic in 1994 in 
accordance with the schedule agreed by the two states' defense 
ministries, and the rest in 1995. By mid-1996 the Mozyr and 
Lida missile divisions will have totally ceased to exist, they 
will be disbanded in accordance with the START Treaty. 
  At the same time the arms and combat hardware withdrawn from 
Belorussian territory will be deployed at Strategic Rocket Force 
bases and arsenals -- they are to replace missiles and launchers 
that have outlived their service life in those regiments on 
combat alert duty on Russian territory that do not come under 
the START-1 and START-2 Treaties. 
  Our newspaper has already reported (No. 25, 9 February) that 
the modernized RS-12M system's standardized solid-fuel 
multiple-warhead missile is to be the basis of Russia's 
Strategic Rocket Forces. Moreover the ratio between fixed-site 
and mobile systems will be 30-40:70-60. 
  Specialists have calculated that these systems and the 
delivery to target of their warhead will cost the country 3-5 
times less than for the sea-based nuclear forces and 5-10 times 
less than for the air force, although they do not cancel out the 
two other components of the nuclear triad. At the same time 
mobile launchers' survivability is 4-5 times greater than that 
of fixed-site launchers. 
  It is very hard to ascertain the location of a wheeled 
vehicle in a vast position area, but silo coordinates are always 
known. To support this idea specialists cite the example of the 
obsolete Iraqi Scud systems, whose launch preparations took many 
hours. During the Gulf War state-of-the-art U.S. reconnaissance 
systems, including space reconnaissance, were unable to detect 
them on the move and in position areas and consequently avert 
missile launches. 
  This factor, as well as many others, promises the Russian 
"Topols" a good future. 
  Incidentally, officers and warrant officers from the missile 
regiments being withdrawn from Belorussia and disbanded, along 
with the enlisted men and NCO's on compulsory military service 
and contract personnel, will not be discharged into the reserve. 
They will make up the strength of other Strategic Rocket Forces 
units experiencing today a considerable shortage of specialist 
missilemen of all kinds. I was assured at the Rocket Forces 
Main Staff that they have all been guaranteed the social rights 
and benefits extended to soldiers of the Russian Federation. 
  Officers and warrant officers from the regiments being 
withdrawn to Russia who do not want to leave Belorussia will be 
discharged into the reserve. They will enjoy all the rights of 
the citizens of the state in which they have remained to live, 
they and their families will keep the apartments in which they 
are now living, and those who have served in the army for 20 
years or more will be paid a military pension in line with 
current legislation. At the Strategic Rocket Forces Main Staff 
I was assured that there has not been a single case of 
infringement of the legitimate rights of the Russian troops 
remaining in Belorussia. 
  Once the strategic offensive arms installations have been 
eliminated on Belorussian territory, the missilemen's military 
camps will be handed over to the republic's defense ministry and 
the vacated apartments to people on the military department's 
waiting list or to other Belorussian citizens. 
  Once it has given up its "Topols" Belorussia will be the 
only 
post-Soviet state to have carried out its commitments to the 
world community without any conditions and stipulations and to 
have really subscribed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons as a nonnuclear country.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia has nothing to do with the development of 
events in the Crimea. It's an internal affair of Ukraine. It's 
essential not to give the radical-minded politicians in Kiev a 
pretext for playing "the Crimean card" for the purpose of 
aggravating the confrontation in relations with Moscow, a senior 
Russian diplomat dealing with Ukrainian problems told Interfax. 
  In comments on President Leonid Kravchuk's decision to 
cancel 
the Crimean leader Yuriy Meshkov's decree to carry out a 
referendum on relations with Kiev, the Russian diplomat said: 
"So far the Ukrainian leadership has no weighty legal arguments. 
After all no one can forbid the Crimean president to hold 
consultations with the populace. As a matter of fact, this does 
not signify the Crimea's secession from Ukraine. A referendum 
may have no direct legal force." 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, it's necessary to take 
into account the circumstance that Leonid Kravchuk's statements 
as to Simferopol's responsibility "for the possible 
complications" in its relationship with Kiev may play "a 
destabilizing role."

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin article: "Talks beween Tajik Authorities and </F>
Opposition Postponed Indefinitely"] 
  [Text] The main goal of Andrey Kozyrev's brief visit to 
Dushanbe was to seek clarification of the Tajik leadership's 
intentions on the eve of the talks with the opposition in 
Moscow. Having persuaded the hostile parties to start up a 
dialogue, Russia is seeking to reconcile the implacable 
adversaries' positions and secure specific moves from them to 
break the deadlock. 
  However, the hopes were not fulfilled. By all accounts there 
will be no talks between the Tajik authorities and the 
opposition in the foreseeable future. Kozyrev indirectly 
acknowledged this when conversing with journalists at the end of 
the meeting with his counterparts from the Central Asian CIS 
states: "Intensive work with the Tajik opposition is under way. 
We are entering into contact with everyone who agrees to 
dialogue. But it is too early to say at the moment when these 
efforts will yield results and it will be possible to hold 
talks." 
  Comparing this cautious evaluation with recent optimistic 
statements by Russian diplomats, it is possible to draw the 
conclusion that the results of the Dushanbe meetings were not at 
all what Kozyrev hoped for. It is not clear as yet who was to 
blame for the postponement of the talks due to start on 16 
March. The Tajik leadership blames the opposition for digging 
its heels in. According to other information Uzbekistan, which 
has enormous influence on the Tajik regime, opposed the talks. 
There are serious grounds for thinking that Tajikistan leader 
Emomali Rakhmonov felt no great desire to start a dialogue with 
the opposition. Having given in to Moscow's pressure and agreed 
to talks against his own will, he was merely waiting for an 
excuse to reconsider his decision. 
  That excuse so desired by the hard-liners in both camps was 
provided on the night of 10-11 March when Tajik Vice Premier 
Mazabsho Nazarshoyev was shot. A native of the Pamirs, which 
are regarded as the opposition's main stronghold, Nazarshoyev 
represented the interests of the people of his region in the 
government. According to one version that I got to hear in 
Dushanbe, the vice premier's removal was a carefully planned 
provocation by Rakhmonov supporters. The organizers of the 
murder achieved their end. Dialogue between the authorities and 
the opposition is on the verge of breakdown. 
  It can be predicted with certainty that all Russian 
diplomacy's efforts will be aimed at ensuring that talks do 
nevertheless take place. From Moscow's standpoint it it is 
essential above all to agree a cease-fire. The political 
settlement mechanism has not yet been defined. Russia is urging 
that elections involving the opposition be held as soon as 
possible; however, there are grounds for thinking that Rakhmonov 
and his team are not very keen on this. 
  According to the experts, if elections are held Rakhmonov 
and 
the Kulyab grouping, which supports him, are almost certain to 
lose. An opposition victory is also unlikely. The influential 
and numerous Leninabad clan has the greatest chance of success. 
Its representatives in the Tajik leadership are ready for 
elections. The next few weeks will show whether these people are 
able to influence Rakhmonov and prompt him to make a compromise. 
  In the opinion of an informed Russian Foreign Ministry 
staffer who asked to remain anonymous, time is working in favor 
of those who support elections and mutual concessions: "The 
military confrontation cannot go on for ever. People's patience 
is running out. The collapse of the Tajik economy has reached 
dire proportions. Only the end of fighting and political 
stabilization can create the conditions necessary to normalize 
the situation. Otherwise, Tajikistan will break up. And that is 
understood by the leaders of both the belligerent sides." 
  As far as Moscow is concerned, the last thing it wants is to 
be dragged into a long-drawn-out, Afghanistan-type conflict. 
Neither the diplomats nor the military cherish any illusions: 
It is impossible to destroy the Tajik opposition detachments 
operating from Afghan territory. The confrontation between them 
and Russian border guards threatens to bring new Russian 
casualties and cause a welling-up of discontent in the country 
and huge material losses. 
  "The Tajik problems cannot be resolved militarily. All hope 
is pinned on dialogue between the authorities and the 
opposition. I hope it will prove fruitful," Colonel General 
Boris Pyankov, commander in chief of the CIS Armed Forces in 
Tajikistan, told journalists. Neither Russia nor the other 
Commonwealth members committed to protecting the Tajik-Afghan 
border are hurrying to send the promised reinforcements. 
According to Pyankov, only Kazakhstan has brought its border 
contingent up to full strength. Russia, Uzbekistan, and 
Kirgiziya [Kyrgyzstan] have yet to do this. The Russian border 
detachments are made up of 70 percent Tajiks right now. That 
figure will become even larger in the immediate future. 
Rakhmonov has promised Kozyrev that another 5,000 Tajik 
draftees will be sent to the border. 
  Moscow is gradually transferring the protection of the 
border 
with Afghanistan to the Tajiks themselves. However, it is most 
likely that this process will drag on and that the white, blue, 
and red flag will fly over the border posts on the southern 
marches of Tajikistan for a long while yet. "Russia's special 
role in Tajikistan is not a whim on our part but an inescapable 
fact. I told this to Secretary of State Christopher in 
Vladivostok. If we leave Tajikistan, chaos will ensure here. 
Look what happened in neighboring Afghanistan. We cannot allow 
that. All attempts to violate the border will be stopped in the 
most resolute fashion. There is no point in the opposition's 
trying to put our endurance to the test; it is better to rely on 
peace talks," Kozyrev told the journalists accompanying him on 
his visit.

to exert vigorous efforts in the framework of the United Nations 
Security Council to promote an early achievement of political 
settlement in Angola, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing on Thursday. 
  "In view of the acuteness and complexity of the situation in 
Angola it would be expedient for the U.N. secretary-general to 
submit to the Security Council a report on the course of the 
negotiations in Lusaka early in April. This would enable the 
Security Council to respond adequately and timely to the 
development of the peacemaking process in Angola," Karasin said. 
  Russian representatives are prepared to continue to meet 
with 
participants in the negotiating process in Luanda, Lusaka and, 
if needed, in Moscow, Karasin said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 17 March broadcasts the 10-minute 
"Details" program presented by Nikolay Svandize, which discussed 
international efforts to solve the problems of the Middle East, 
as the UN Security Council prepares to adopt a resolution on the 
Hebron massacre. The program consists of excerpts from an 
interview with Igor Ivanov, Russian first deputy foreign 
minister, a dispatch from Israel by correspondent Vladislav 
Flyarkovskiy, and Svanidze's own comments. 
  The program begins with comments by Igor Ivanov, who says: 
"The withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the Jericho 
region was due to have been completed by 13 April, after which 
the process of establishing Palestinian self-rule would have 
begun. You see, these were specific and practical steps. They 
were not just talks, they were practical steps that would have 
been the result of the complex talks that continued over two 
years. 
  "It is difficult to say at the moment whether this murderer 
was acting individually or whether he was an instrument in a 
larger conspiracy, as both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides 
have set up investigative commissions. As you know, there are 
substantial disagreements about this question as well, and the 
results of these investigative groups will show how things 
really are. 
  "But independently of that, unfortunately this crime had the 
most negative consequences on a wider scale." 
  Svanidze then introduces the theme of the program, noting 
that the United Nations plans to adopt a resolution of principle 
on the Middle East tomorrow, and that Russia and the United 
States are named as the resolution's cosponsors. Ivanov's 
interview continues: 
  "On the one hand, some people in the region tried 
immediately 
to interpret our activity as a kind of attempt, following our 
diplomatic successes in the Yugoslav settlement, to develop this 
success in the Middle East. Others also tried to interpret it 
as an attempt to, as it were, in some way pass the United States 
on the bend in that region. 
  "In our view, a very tough UN Security Council resolution 
should now be adopted, which on the one hand condemns the crime 
in Hebron and on the other, outlines specific measures that 
would both promote the security of the Palestinian population in 
the occupied territories and clear the way for the resumption of 
the talks process. Why do we believe this? Because today those 
tiny shoots of trust that had just appeared between the Israelis 
and the Palestinians have been seriously damaged." 
  There then follows a three-minute dispatch from Jerusalem by 
correspondent Vladislav Flyarkovskiy, who describes the 
situation in the region three weeks on from the Hebron massacre. 
Ivanov's interview continues: 
  "I would like to explain that this resolution contains a 
condemnation of the Hebron crime, and an appeal to the Israeli 
side to adopt measures to prevent more acts of violence toward 
Palestinians. It contains an appeal for measures to be worked 
out to ensure the security of Palestinians, including the 
sending of this or that international presence. And it contains 
an appeal to the two cosponsors -- the United States and Russia 
-- to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the resolution 
clauses are implemented, and to promote the continuation of the 
peace process." 
  The final two interview excerpts are interspersed with 
Svanidze's own comments and conclusions: 
  Ivanov continues: "I am not expecting any opposition to the 
resolution. There may be certain privately held views about 
individual clauses in the preamble to the resolution, 
particularly where the references to Jerusalem are concerned, 
where the United States will probably abstain. There should be 
full unanimity concerning the resolution proper. 
  "As far as our efforts in the Middle East are concerned, I 
repeat that they are currently very carefully thought out, and 
they meet our long-term interests." 
  Svanidze then ends the program with his own comments.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>
  [Excerpt] Moscow, 17 Mar -- The Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs is concerned that a group of experts from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was unable fully to 
carry out the tasks of inspecting the nuclear facilities of the 
DPRK. A high-ranking source at the Russian Federation Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs told an ITAR-TASS correspondent this today. 
"This creates quite a serious situation," the diplomat said. 
  In his words, Russia is holding consultations on this matter 
with other IAEA members. He noted however that there is still 
some time before the meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors, set 
for 21 March, at which the results of the inspections are due to 
be discussed. Consequently, the situation could develop in a 
variety of ways, and the Russian Foreign Ministry will be 
following it carefully. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kaliningrad, 17 Mar -- "I am in Kaliningrad Oblast 
to resolve the issue of setting up a limited operational group 
made up from the forces of the Baltic Fleet and from the 
land-based forces." This was stated today by Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev on arrival in Kaliningrad. He has begun 
a three-day tour of inspection of the country's westernmost 
oblast. 
  According to the minister, the numerical strength of the 
group that is being set up "will be determined by the defensive 
sufficiency necessary to protect this enclave territory and also 
Russia's interests in the Baltic region." "The final decision 
on setting up the group and its deployment will be made by a 
Defense Ministry collegium," Pavel Grachev stressed.

  [Text] Kaliningrad March 18 TASS -- Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev announced on Thursday night an intention 
to create a special defence area in Russia's most western 
Kaliningrad region on the basis of the Baltic Fleet units and 
the 11th Guards Army stationed here. The minister came here on 
Thursday afternnon to discuss the issue with the region's 
military officers. 
  "The Kaliningrad region is different from all other Russian 
regions because of its geographic and enclave position", Grachev 
noted. "And the mobile grouping to be formed here is designed to 
ensure reliable protection of this territory against military 
threats from both the sea and land", he stressed. However, 
there will be no sweeping reductions in the officers' corps, the 
minister promised, therefore there are no grounds for concern. 
  Grachev informed officers about the progress of military 
reform. He also reported that some 20 new laws on armed forces 
were being drafted at the moment, "since many provisions of the 
laws passed by the former Supreme Soviet do no meet the Army's 
interests". Among the most important laws, the minister cited 
those on martial law, on military police, on courts martial. 
  The defence minister answered questions from the audience. 
After the meeting, well-known variety actors, who came from 
Moscow together with Grachev, gave a performance.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified reporter; from the "Pacific Ocean" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Acting upon a ruling confirmed by the Maritime Kray 
prosecutor, the Maritime Kray administration removed Viktor 
Ivanovich Cherepkov, head of Vladivostok city administration, 
for the duration of preliminary investigation of criminal file 
No. 474-731. The Maritime Kray court endorses the application 
of this criminal procedural measure. Viktor Ivanovich Cherepkov 
is charged with accepting extensive bribes from citizen Volkov. 
Kray administration decree No. 108, issued on 16 March, 
nominated Konstantin Borisovich Tolstoshein as the acting head 
of Vladivostok city administration for the duration of criminal 
investigation of Viktor Cherepkov. When a Maritime Radio 
correspondent asked Tolstoshein where he would begin, this is 
what he said. 
  [Tolstoshein] We are taking all the necessary measures so as 
to attend not to politics but to practical matters, to the most 
serious questions of survival of the city of Vladivostok. In 
this connection, I issued a decree nominating my deputies at 
2000 hours yesterday [1000 GMT 16 March]. I have also issued a 
statement on reorganization of the structure of the city 
administration, and on nomination of heads of rayon 
administrations. When we gathered, we all reached a consensus: 
The first task of the Vladivostok city authorities is to begin 
cleaning up the city immediately, beginning tomorrow. To be 
more precise, it is already night time, so the cleaning will 
begin today. [sentence as heard] 
  Our second task: I believe that we should pay the utmost 
attention to transportation problems, which includes buses, 
trolley buses, and trams, and of course the railroad. The dacha 
season will begin very soon, and it will simply not do if the 
trains do not run. They are very expensive, but how will the 
pensioners and people who do not have their own transportation 
commute to their dachas? Therefore we all think that this is one 
of the main problems. We plan to open as many stores as 
necessary for the handicapped, World War II veterans, victims of 
Chernobyl, and veterans of Afghanistan. Therefore, the emphasis 
will be on people. We have agreed that the dominant factor in 
our work will be the person. Naturally, one of the most 
important questions in our activities from the very beginning 
will be the issue of preparing for the winter of 1994-1995. We 
are beginning our work, and we call all residents of Vladivostok 
to respond to our requests. We call on all leaders of 
enterprises, commercial structures and the various forms of 
property: Let us all drop confrontation, political intrigue, 
and other activities that do not grace either us or our life. 
Let us make Vladivostok a city which will be pleasant to come 
to, which will be pleasant for our relatives or foreigners -- it 
does not matter who -- to come to. We must tidy our city up, 
improve its appearance. After all, we have to live in this city. 
  [Reporter] Konstantin Borisovich, it is 0300 in the night 
[1700 GMT] now. Is it necessary for you to be here? 
  [Tolstoshein] Of course it is. We started serious work from 
the very first minutes. I have already told you that we are 
trying to solve the problems of reducing the city 
administration. The city administration has been bloated out of 
all proportion, and understandably, this has consequences: Every 
person working here gets a salary, and a fairly large one. 
However, I have to tell you that three people are responsible 
for the same sphere of activity, and only their job titles are 
different. And each of them gets a pretty wild salary. We are 
sitting here working on this problem this very moment. I have 
to tell the city residents that probably the staff bloated by 
the previous administration could not handle its job because 
there were too many people harnessed to specific jobs. We are 
going to review all of this. In our administration, each person 
will earn his pay by being responsible for a concrete sphere of 
activity. 
  [Reporter] If this is not a military secret, could you tell 
us who will head the rayon administrations? I think that 
everyone is concerned about this. 
  [Tolstoshein] Of course this is not a secret. I signed a 
decree nominating the heads of rayon administrations yesterday 
at 2000 hours. Pervomayskiy Rayon: Viktor Gennadiyevich 
Pletnev; Leninskiy Rayon: Sergey Semenovich Zhurmilov; 
Frunzenskiy Rayon: Viktor Andreyevich Goncharov; Pervorechenskiy 
Rayon: Aleksandr Vladimirovich Avdeyev; and Tamara Borisovna 
Vadilyeva will be the acting head of Sovetskiy Rayon. We shall 
see what happens next. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The events in Vladivostok have squeezed news from 
Moscow into the background. Igor Lebedinets, deputy head of the 
Vladivostok administration, reported that an armed group of 
people had seized the city administration building. 
  According to Reuter, the group consists of 50 members of the 
Special Purpose Militia Detachments [OMON]. Viktor Cherepkov, 
head of the Vladivostok administration, is now in the building. 
He is a sick man, having had a heart attack. 
  There is, practically, no legitimate authority in the town. 
Lebedinets, deputy head of administration, has asked the Russian 
president and the head of government to take urgent measures. 
  [Begin video report by M. Velikoselskiy and A. Savelev] 
Viktor Cherepkov, the mayor of Vladivostok, was forcibly removed 
from office in the early hours of 17 March by the Kray 
administration, using the militia forces. The mayor's office is 
blocked by the OMON, and our Vesti team was not allowed into the 
building. (Veniyamin Chichayev), senior assistant of the kray 
procurator, said the mayor had been removed in connection with 
bribery charges and failing to attend a hearing. The kray court 
gave its consent, because Cherepkov is standing as a candidate 
to the kray duma. 
  According to eyewitnesses, the mayor, who was elected by the 
town people and who suffers from a heart complaint, was carried 
out of the mayor's office, while Vladimir Gilginberg, in charge 
of the city's affairs, was thrown out by force. 
  [Begin Gilginberg voice recording] I was chucked out. About 
five militiamen, sergeants, I think, grabbed me by my hands and 
legs and threw me out, throwing my jacket and hat out after me, 
into the bargain. [end recording] 
  Konstantin Tolstoshein has been appointed acting mayor. 
Cherepkov got significantly more votes than he did during the 
elections. In the meantime, it came out that on the eve of the 
operation, the city's hospitals had received an urgent 
instruction to prepare beds for the wounded as a result of a 
possible Kamchatka earthquake. Both Kamchatka authorities and 
the hydrometeorological service categorically denied today that 
a cataclysm could occur over the next few days. Cherepkov's 
supporters are picketing the mayor's office and the removed 
mayor has gone on a hunger strike. [end video report] 
  [Announcer] Nonetheless, Igor Lebedinets denied rumours that 
Viktor Cherepkov's removal gave rise to indignation among the 
people of Vladivostok. On the contrary, he told an Interfax 
correspondent, it made the town dwellers breathe easy again. 
When I presented Konstantin Tolstoshein, who will be the town's 
acting mayor, to the public, people applauded, added Lebedinets.

  [Text] The officer on duty in the Primorskoye Territory 
Interior Department told Interfax that the media reports of 
riots provoked in Vladivostok by the removal of mayor Viktor 
Cherepkov for bribe taking were untrue. 
  The officer also said that no gunmen had taken over the 
mayor's office Thursday. Cherepkov and his deputy had been 
evicted from the mayor's office Wednesday. 
  The officer said that as few as twenty, mostly elderly, 
supporters of Cherepkov, had been outside the city 
administration office in the early hours of Thursday. 
  Igor Lebedinets, deputy head of the territorial 
administration, told Interfax that the former mayor's supporters 
exaggerated the importance of the event. 
  An officer on duty in the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service 
said that the police, and not his agency, were handling the case. 
  The official representative of the territory in Moscow told 
Interfax that the situation in Vladivostok was quiet and 
Cherepkov had been removed from the mayor's office the day 
before. 
  Cherepkov could not be reached by phone. The territory 
representative said that Cherepkov had changed his telephone 
number on several occasions during his tenure of office. Now he 
probably simply did not want to lift the receiver. The official 
said that the exact whereabouts of Cherepkov were unknown. He 
had not been arrested but had been told not to leave the city.

  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Acting Russian Public 
Prosecutor Aleksey Ilyushenko ordered one of his senior 
investigators on Thursday to probe into the case of Vladivostok 
Mayor Viktor Cherepkov accused of bribe-taking, the press centre 
of the public prosecutor's office said. 
  Criminal proceedings against Cherepkov were instituted in 
February 1994 on charges of bribery. 
  The decision followed the second day of unrest in the city. 
On Wednesday, armed riot police stormed the mayor's office and 
told Cherepkov and his closest aides they were dismissed from 
office. First Deputy Mayor Vladimir Gilgenberg, who put up 
resistance, was literally carried out from the building by 
police. 
  This was the second armed invasion of the city 
administration 
building. The first one occurred on the night of February 13, 
and was prompted, according to an official version, by the need 
to question Cherepkov on receiving a bribe from a certain 
Volkov. The mayor then remained at power thanks to public 
support. 
  Supporters of the toppled mayor, including a group of voters 
who nominated him to the regional council, have announced that 
Cherepkov's toppling was an act of open arbitrariness and a 
gross violation of human rights. They said they would hold acts 
of protest, including hunger strikes at the regional 
administration headquarters.

  [Text] Deputy Head of the Maritime Territorial 
Administration Igor Lebedinets has denied rumors that the 
dismissal of Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov aroused general 
protest in the city. On the contrary, the population of 
Vladivostok sighed with relief, he told Interfax on Thursday. 
  "The public welcomed with applause the news that the mayor's 
duties will be performed by Konstantin Tolstoshein," he said. 
  Viktor Cherepkov was removed from office on Wednesday on 
charges of bribe-taking. 
  According to Interfax sources, the police had to use force 
to 
oust Cherepkov from his office. To quote Lebedintsev, policemen 
virtually carried him out of city hall. 
  Legal action was started against the city administration 
more 
than a month ago. The investigators believe that they have 
collected enough evidence for accusing Cherepkov of bribe-taking. 
  The Maritime Territorial Administration has appointed 
Konstantin Tolstoshein, the former head of the Pervorechensk 
Regional Administration (the Vladivostok Region) to the post of 
acting mayor of Vladivostok. 
  For health reasons Cherepkov has not been questioned yet as 
a 
defendant.

acting head of the Kray administration, held a news conference 
for foreign and Russian journalists today at 1000 hours [0000 
GMT] in the Vladivostok city administration building. 
Konstantin Borisovich Tolstoshein gave details of plans for 
administration of the city, specifically, on bringing order to 
Vladivostok in the ordinary city management sense of the word; 
and on care for veterans, invalids, and the poor. As stated at 
the news conference, additional stores will be opened to cater 
to them in the very near future. There was talk about preparing 
the city for next winter and, despite the warm March days, this 
work has already begun. 
  Today, at 1100 hours [0100 GMT], a news conference organized 
by the dismissed workers of the Gray House [Vladivostok 
administration building] was also held near the city 
administration building. According to our correspondent, some 
40-50 people attended armed with placards and slogans, mostly 
from the Voters Association whom the city inhabitants saw 
yesterday. The latest news conference did not add any new 
information to shed light on what has happened.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS observer Tamara Zamyatina report specially for </F>
IZVESTIYA: "Moscow Mayor's Argument with Country's Government"] 
  [Text] "I am not planning to run for president, even if 
asked to," that was the position staked out by Mayor Yuriy 
Luzhkov of Moscow in our conversation. In his opinion, the 
published ratings of politicians in which Luzhkov ranks third as 
a possible contender for the post of head of state "get on my 
nerves. At the same time, after 50 years everyone knows their 
own worth, and so do I. My philosophy, my goal, and the meaning 
of my career is to do something useful for Moscow and win 
people's respect in my job," the mayor of the capital said. 
  Yu. Luzhkov makes no secret of his concern over the recent 
political amnesty, which, in his opinion, if it had to be 
carried out at all, should not have happened before 9 May, since 
the opposition's love of red-letter days is well-known. 
  And he is alarmed not so much by the release of the 10 main 
organizers of the October bloodshed in Moscow as by the amnesty 
for the "20,000 to 100,000 other criminals." Luzhkov believes 
that a considerable number of them will head for the capital. 
And he does not rule out the possibility that the former 
Lefortovo inmates and amnestied criminals "have common interests 
which money could help to bring closer together." 
  Luzhkov has no doubt that the opposition is well backed up 
by 
interested structures. "On 3-4 October the White House was 
being supported by gunmen and the members of fascist 
organizations. Big money was at work," he stated, referring to 
information from the special services. In order to ensure that 
the "victims" do not join forces to organize new unrest, the 
mayor intends to develop necessary measures at a session of the 
Moscow Anticrisis Committee. 
  Luzhkov is also disappointed about the fact that the 
political amnesty has sown dissension and confusion among 
law-enforcement workers. "MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] 
staffers' ability to counteract the opposition is even weaker 
today than it was 3-4 October," he believes. The fall in morale 
is explained, in his opinion, by the fact that a considerable 
number of militia workers now doubt whether it was right for 
them to side with the president and the government. "It is as 
if we are numbering law-enforcement staffers among the 
analytical public. Yet these are people of direct action. Now 
they are saying among themselves that there was no point in 
their swimming against the tide, since nothing came of it -- 
either with the State Committee for the State of Emergency or 
with the organizers of the October coup." The fact that the 
militia is taking the same approach to the relationship between 
the presidential and opposition sides as it does to mafia 
investigations is even worse. The militia, the mayor said, 
sometimes deliberately delays such investigations by 15-20 
minutes to allow criminal groupings the time to finish each 
other off, so that the militiamen can pick up the pieces on the 
battlefield later. 
  The political consequences of the amnesty have thereby, in 
the mayor's opinion, been directly counter to the deputies' good 
intentions of bringing harmony to society. 
  A destabilizing factor, Yuriy Luzhkov believes, is the 
smoldering polemic on the timing of the next presidential 
elections. He rebukes the press for, in his view, being 
excessively and prematurely interested in the subject: 
  "Understand that it will not be any individual but the 
economic situation in the country that will predetermine the 
outcome of these elections," he exclaimed. 
  Like Viktor Chernomyrdin, who believes that it would be 
"unethical" under the current president to be talking about the 
next election, Yuriy Luzhkov considers such talk "unpresidential 
and undermining the head of state's authority." "Let's put this 
subject to one side until 1996," was his appeal to the press. 
  The mayor of Moscow refuted the numerous press claims that 
he 
had set up the Party of the Majority for his own future election 
campaign. "I have nothing to do with it, apart from the fact 
that, at the request of one of my friends, I signed a greetings 
message to the constituent congress of the Party of the 
Majority, since its aim of supporting the formation of a class 
of entrepreneurs does not run counter to my views," the mayor 
explained. 
  According to him, of all our parties he has most sympathy 
for 
the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, whose leaders -- 
Gavriil Popov and Anatoliy Sobchak -- have the "most sensible 
ideas." But when asked if he agreed with Gavriil Popov's claim 
that the political amnesty was thought up by Boris Yeltsin 
himself to rally the democrats around the president, Luzhkov 
laughed: "The press sometimes flatters politicians by ascribing 
a farsignted strategy to them. Sometimes after such articles 
you start to respect yourself. In actual fact decisions are 
most often made without any particular plan in mind." And that 
is a pity. 
  Incidentally, in Luzhkov's opinion the economic and social 
situation in Moscow at the moment is far more stable than in 
other parts of Russia. "For this reason not one of the 15 
candidates from Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party who ran 
in Moscow made it to the State Duma," the mayor believes. 
  At the same time, he is by no means complacent about the 
state of affairs in the capital, where the implementation of 
social programs is being held up owing to a lack of funds. Nor 
can you envy Sergey Dubinin, Russian Federation acting finance 
minister, about whom Yuriy Luzhkov was justifiably angry: 
  "Last year alone Moscow paid 27 trillion rubles into the 
federal budget. Yet you can't get anything about of state 
coffers for the capital's needs. Dubinin states: `Subsidies? 
You won't get any!' And I ask him: How are we supposed to 
solve urgent problems and, in addition, maintain this huge 
machinery of the state organs located in Moscow? 
  "Nobody is working on tax reform," Luzhkov continued. "Chaos 
reigns in the tax collection system. Yet the Russian Government 
has introduced a 3-percent tax to support high-tech enterprises. 
And this is a turnover tax, which in monetary terms is many 
times greater than any profits tax. And nobody explains how the 
state is spending value-added tax and other revenue -- otherwise 
they would have to admit the irrational spending of budget 
funds." 
  This kind of tax policy, in Yuriy Luzhkov's opinion, 
"stifles 
enterprises and prevents them from expanding production." 
  One other "headache" for the mayor is the import duties that 
have been introduced by the Russian Government: 
  "I recently visited the food fair at the Izmaylovo complex. 
Trade was brisk and Moscow enterprises were actively concluding 
contracts with food suppliers from the provinces. The same day 
Central TV showed an interview with Vice Premier Aleksandr 
Zaveryukha, who stated: `We in the government are examining the 
question of raising the duty on imported foodstuffs by 20-30 
percent.' The next day agrarians at the fair stopped signing 
contracts, referring to the fact that they would need to revise 
their prices -- in what direction is obvious. Nonetheless, the 
government carried out its intention. I am sure that import 
duties were raised to satisfy the agricultural lobby, and this 
decision will lead to a sharp increase in the prices not only of 
imported foodstuffs, but of Russian food too. First and 
foremost, it will have an impact on the cost of the basket of 
consumer goods for residents of large cities. And it is not 
clear why it is necessary to slow the influx of foreign food 
into the country. Have we really achieved surpluses? 
Disagreeing with this measure, the mayors of three major cities 
-- Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Yekaterinburg -- intend to send a 
protest to the government. 
  "I am convinced that the state should be concerned about the 
unity of its goals rather than about resolving local tasks. As 
regards the agrarian sector we need to improve production forces 
and production relations, as the classics of Marxism-Leninism 
taught us, rather than trying to ensure that Russian foodstuffs 
are competitive by cranking up the prices of imports. Otherwise 
the countryside's problems will again be resolved at the cities' 
expense." 
  Luzhkov has been arguing about tax policy not only with the 
acting finance minister but with Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin too. According to the mayor, he tried to persuade 
the premier that there is no point in increasing duties on 
foreign cars imported into the country. As was the case with 
duty on food imports, this measure, he believes, will only serve 
to boost car prices, but without in any way improving Russian 
car manufacture. "Duty should be increased on right-hand drive 
cars and cars more than 10 years old to prevent pollution and to 
stop Russia's car scrap heaps filling up" -- that was the 
argument he put to Chernomyrdin. When asked how the prime 
minister reacted, Yuriy Luzhkov countered with disarming 
frankness: "He adopted the previously planned decision of 
raising import duties." 
  As we can see, the mayor of Moscow is fully immersed in 
economic concerns. He made a point of stressing his reluctance 
to play politics. "We need to get creative processes going and 
start work. Then the opposition will retreat," Luzhkov said.

  [Text] Russia's refusal to join NATO's Partnership for 
Peace program will strengthen the positions of supporters of 
NATO's expansion, while Russia will lose an opportunity to 
influence this program, head of a Security Council department 
Yuriy Nazarkin told the State Duma. 
  He is convinced that the positive aspects of this program 
and 
NATO's potential should be used for creating a European 
collective security system, for strengthening the CSCE and for 
broadening cooperation in peacemaking and military conversion. 
  Nazarkin was supported by head of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's Department for European Cooperation Yuriy Ushakov, 
who said that Russia's isolation from NATO's initiative will 
deprive it of the opportunity to influence the implementation of 
the Partnership or Peace program, and NATO's cooperation with 
Eastern European and CIS countries. 
  Ushakov believes that Russia will also sustain considerable 
financial losses, because it will lose its Eastern European arms 
markets which will "completely pass over to NATO after the 
Eastern European countries join this program." As we reported 
earlier, this program envisages a standardization of armaments. 
  To quote Ushakov, Russia's participation in the NATO program 
does not exclude protection of its national interests. 
  Chairman of the State Duma's Committee for International 
Affairs, Russia's former ambassador to the U.S. Vladimir Lukin 
thinks, however, that Moscow should not join this program 
hastily because, he said, "we have already missed the most 
appropriate moment for doing so." 
  In his opinion, since the U.S. is ready to broaden relations 
with Russia, instead of "pushing its way to the head of the 
line" Russia should analyze what should be done for a more 
active rapprochement with this organization and closely follow 
its reorganization.

  [Text] If Russia joins NATO's Partnership for Peace [PFP] 
program this should be carried out on special terms given "its 
status of a nuclear power which possesses a mighty potential." 
This conclusion was drawn by the participants of the 
parliamentary hearings on the Partnership for Peace program held 
in the State Duma on Wednesday, Chairman of the Defense 
Committee of the parliament's lower chamber Sergey Yushenkov 
(Russia's Choice bloc) reported in his interview with Interfax. 
  In his words, at the hearings it was recommended to join the 
program and to consider NATO's program "as the beginning of the 
path towards the creation of a common security system." The 
State Duma was recommended to hear information by Russian 
Foreign Minister's spokesmen, Defense Minister, and secretary of 
the Russian Federation Security Council at one of the nearest 
"governmental hours." 
  During the discussions in the State Duma on Thursday, Major 
General Pavel Zolotaryov, representative of the Russian Defense 
Ministry, expressed his support to the idea to join NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program. 
  Zolotaryov underlined that the Defense Ministry understands 
that this program "is one of the concrete trends in NATO's 
strategy" aimed at detention by means of cooperation rather than 
using deterrents. 
  According to his estimate, if Russia refuses to join this 
program it will occupy "a self-isolating position of an alien 
supervisor over processes going on in Europe" and it "will be 
less listened to." 
  Zolotaryov pointed out that Russia should demonstrate its 
political will and resoluteness to actively participate in the 
new system of collective security and creation of an efficient 
military mechanism to deter wars and conflicts. It is also 
necessary to push for the development of common approaches by 
Russia and NATO to the problems of military security and 
strategic stability; and for the recognition by NATO of Russia's 
special role in supporting stability on the CIS territory.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report: "Russo-Estonian Border </F>
Problems. Tallinn's Arguments Prove Unconvincing for Moscow"] 
  [Text] Estonia's territorial claims on Russia formed the 
topic of yesterday's hearings in the Duma. An active pressure 
being put by the Estonian side of late on the residents and 
local authorities of Pskov and Novgorod Oblasts (free 
distribution of Estonian citizenship, issue of Estonian 
passports and real estate privatization certificates on Russian 
territory) has run against Moscow's harsh reaction, something 
unexpected by Tallinn. Not only representatives of Russia's 
state power in these oblasts, but also all the power structures 
have received instructions to cut short, using all legal means, 
"Estonian provocations." Simultaneously, the Russian Foreign 
Ministry and the Federal Border Service have produced a draft 
government decision to tighten checkpoint rules along the 
Estonian border. The emergence of this document came as an 
unpleasant surprise for Estonian representatives attending the 
hearings. 
  In the view of Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma 
International 
Affairs Committee, having signed on 12 January 1991 a treaty 
with Russia on the principles of interstate relations, Estonia 
virtually recognized the absence on its part of territorial 
claims (in Article 6, the sides recognize each other's 
territorial integrity and territorial sovereignty). Because of 
this alone, references to the Tartu Peace Treaty signed in 1920 
have no legal force. The very progress of talks that terminated 
in the signing of this treaty attested to the Estonian side's 
intention to get from Russia as much as possible in solving the 
state border problem. (The talks were frequently interrupted by 
Tallinn while Estonian troops, which had resumed military 
actions, were moving deeper into Russian territory). 
  Besides, in the opinion of the Russian side, having become 
part of the USSR in 1940, Estonia lost its status as an 
international law entity. Hence, there exist at least two 
reasons for which Tallinn's territorial claims (incidentally, 
they studiously avoid this term in Estonia) today are unfounded. 
Tallinn's representatives at the hearings, naturally, disagreed 
which such a solution of the border question. In their opinion, 
Article 2 of the Tartu Treaty is in effect even today; that is, 
the border should run across the present territory of Pskov 
Oblast. Russia intends to dot the "i's" by toughening the 
border area rules and strictly indicating the position of border 
checkpoints. Russia will draw the final border "on location" 
even if Estonia declines to take part in this process.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report under the "Project" rubric: "State </F>
Duma Deputies Intend To Legitimize `Russia's Peacemaker 
Activities'"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the State Duma passed in the first 
reading a draft federal law "On the Procedure for the Provision 
of Russian Federation Military and Civilian Personnel for the 
Participation in Operations to Maintain or Restore International 
Peace and Security, and in Other Types of Peacekeeping 
Activities." 
  According to Defense Committee figures, at the moment, one 
Russian battalion of 1,200 men is on the territory of 
Yugoslavia, four battalions numbering 1,778 men are in Moldova, 
one regiment of 503 men is in Georgia, and one division of 5,982 
men is in Tajikistan. In addition to these military formations, 
according to committee chairman Sergey Yushenkov, 87 Russian 
military observers are taking part in UN peacekeeping 
operations. Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian Federation deputy 
defense minister, told parliamentarians yesterday, however, that 
16,500 Russian soldiers are present in the so-called "hot spots" 
today. Interestingly, General Kondratyev urged that on no 
account "a limit be set" on the permitted participation of 
Russian Federation servicemen in such actions. 
  The presenters of official reports agreed that "peacekeeping 
forces" should be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of Russia's 
Armed Forces and subordinated to the Ministry for Emergency 
Situations. 
  It was decided to forward the draft federal law to the 
president, the deputy factions, the groups and commissions "for 
the preparation of proposals and remarks."

  [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
refused on Friday to discuss the cancellation of the agreement 
instituting the Commonwealth of Independent States which was 
signed by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus in 1991 and 
which actually signalled the collapse of the former Soviet Union. 
  The proposal was submitted by Anatoliy Lukyanov, former 
speaker of the Soviet parliament, who faced trial as an 
organiser of the 1991 coup which resulted in the Soviet 
collapse, but was amnestied by the Duma. 
  Lukyanov is now a member of the "Russian Way" group in the

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS news analyst Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Members of many 
parliamentary factions and parties represented in the State Duma 
are ready to work on a memorandum on civic peace and accord 
suggested by the Russian president. However, they have 
different notions of a document and different views on its 
importance. This is shown by in interview given to ITAR-TASS by 
representatives of parties in the lobbies of the lower chamber 
of parliament. 
  Gennadiy Burbulis, member of the parliamentary faction of 
Russia's Choice party described the president's proposal as 
absolutely neccessary and very promising. "Whatever interests 
are pursued by those who are ready to participate in this 
process, the idea of civic peace and national accord is highly 
relevant to Russia," Burbulis said. He added that he will be 
assisting the president so that this idea be implemented 
convincingly. 
  Valentin Kuptsov, a leader of the Communist Party of Russia, 
said the party is ready to take part in drafting the document. 
He said it should be based on a memorandum on civic peace and 
accord adopted by the State Duma in a package with documents on 
amnesty. "The memorandum should be carefully drawn up and the 
method of its implementation should be considered," he added. 
  Leader of the Agrarian Party Mikhail Lapshin said the party 
will be involved in drafting the document, but it will raise 
many questions, including those regarding the revival of the 
Russian village, and will be watching closely that accord should 
not lead to the suppression of part of society. 
  Anatoliy Sliva, representative of the Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord, expressed extreme perplexity over the fact that the 
party which, according to him, suggested the memorandum on 
accord to the Duma has not been invited to participate in the 
work on the document proposed by the president. But then, it is 
inessential who has come up with the idea. The point of the 
matter is that there is much speculation on this idea. He 
believes the idea of civic peace should be down-to-earth and 
should by implemented in specific deads. 
  Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, 
believes that civic accord in society is indispensible, but he 
sees the road to it not in any one document, no matter how 
exhaustive and with how many parties, its signatories, but in 
achieving accord between the two branches of power -- executive 
and legislative. 
  The opposition takes a radical stand on the matter. This was 
the spirit of statements of Aleksandr Nevzorov and Sergey 
Baburin, representatives of the "Russian Path" national 
patriotic group, that has not yet been registered. The former 
dismissed the memorandum's idea as "hypocricy." The latter said 
that for the president "this is not a memorandum of accord but a 
memorandum of humility."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "`Who Is Guilty?' and `What Is </F>
To Be Done?' -- These Are Questions Which Continue To Torment 
the State Duma in Connection With the Discussion of the Russian 
Federation President's Message"] 
  [Text] The State Duma's draft decree on the Russian 
Federation president's message is once again being returned to 
the working group for additional work to be done. Not one of 
the versions proposed Wednesday morning was passed. In fact, 
two approaches were considered: The first included a political 
assessment of the situation which has taken shape in the country 
and which was noted in the president's message itself; the 
second without a political preamble, consisted exclusively of 
the decree section which speaks of proposals to the Russian 
Federation Government for overcoming the socioeconomic crisis in 
the country and of the Duma's plans in the same area. The first 
version was insisted on by the Communists, the Agrarians, "New 
Regional Policy," and the "Russian Path" deputies' group. The 
second version was insisted on by "Russia's Choice" and the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord. 
  The distribution of votes which has taken shape in all the 
principal ballots is such that none of the sides can count on a 
"clear victory." But preliminary accords are still 
proliferating in the sessions. 
  It is, in general, not difficult to calculate why. The 
political preamble is essentially perceived as an "indictment" 
of those who have supported and implemented the reforms in 
Russia over the past two years. It is also clear that "Russia's 
Choice" will never agree to the prospect of the revival of 
"state management of a mixed economy." 
  If we read through both texts carefully, then, with the 
exception of the aforementioned preamble, we will not find many 
differences between them. Except that there is an appendix to 
the "political" version with an approximate list of laws of 
paramount state importance. Among the 22 draft laws the law "On 
State Policy in the Sphere of Defense and the Country's 
Security" is placed seventh in terms of significance. 
  The litigant sides will most likely have to make a 
compromise 
in the very near future. If only because the document itself -- 
the decree on the Russian Federation president's message -- will 
hardly be of great applied significance. The deputies 
themselves said as much. It turns out that the lower chamber of 
the Federal Assembly is still continuing to expend its energy on 
exclusively political debates and is not able to switch to a 
concrete list of the laws which the country is awaiting with 
enviable patience.

  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- The Russian Parliament's 
upper house, the Federation Council, decided to continue 
hearings on the situation in the zone under state of emergency 
rule in North Ossetia and Ingushetia, House Speaker Vladimir 
Shumeyko told reporters after the Federation Council's 
closed-door meeting. According to him, "the conflict between 
the Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia is extremely 
acute, since one of the main human rights, the right to live, is 
being violated". 
  Shumeyko reported that lawmakers instructed the Federation 
Council chairman to set up a special commission for further 
investigation into this issue. After this, the commission is to 
submit its proposals for the president's consideration. 
Lawmakers think it necessary to hold an enlarged meeting of the 
Security Council with the participation of the special 
commission so that the next meeting of the upper house could 
pass the final decision. 
  The Federation Council chairman emphasised that this 
mechanism of decision-making was the most expedient. In his 
opinion, many decisions have been taken earlier, but all of them 
were never implemented. Therefore, Shumeyko stressed, "it is 
critical that all the three branches of power (the Federation 
Council, the president and the government) discuss this issue 
and make a joint decision". 
  The upper house speaker also told reporters that deputies 
adopted at their meeting an appeal to the peoples of Ingushetia 
and North Ossetia. The document stresses the need "to lay down 
arms and solve the problems piled over many years by peaceful 
means".

relations, Pastukhov called attention to article 33, which says 
that "the treaty shall be subject to ratification and shall 
become effective after the exchange of ratification instruments 
of the two countries." He pointed out that President Yeltsin had 
stressed before signing the treaty that "its ratification is 
possible only after obvious headway is made in the settlement of 
the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict." 
  According to Pastukhov, now the Russian Foreign Ministry and 
Defence Ministry are unanimous in their opinion that "not a 
single cartridge should be turned over to the Georgian side, not 
even for the needs of the Georgian Interior Ministry." He 
stressed the need for a closer cooperation between members of 
the Federation Council and the Foreign Ministry. 
  The Federation Council adopted today draft regulations on 
the 
parliamentary group of the Federal Assembly. According to 
Speaker of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, the 
parliamentary group of the Federal Assembly will be made up of 
members of the State Duma and the Federation Council in order to 
represent the Russian parliament in international organisations. 
Aside from it, the Federation Council adopted a resolution on 
the creation of a hospitality fund. 
  The legislators adopted a resolution on the amount of 
monthly 
remuneration for members of the Federation Council holding 
elective posts. According to the resolution, 299,000 roubles 
will be added to their monthly salaries, equal to those of 
ministers, and to other privileges. According to Shumeyko, "the 
rise in wages is intended for members of Federation Council 
committees working on a full-time basis, as well as for deputies 
to the Federation Council to cover travelling expenses."

Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Twenty eight members of Eduard Shevardnadze's office 
were subjected to an unusual procedure on Wednesday. They began 
to undergo medical tests designed to reveal drug abusers. 
  As Interfax learned from the Georgian leader's aides, state 
counsellors, chiefs of departments and ordinary members of the 
office had their urine tested, showed doctors their blood 
vessels and answered questions. All this aims to rid government 
institutions of drug addicts. According to an official, such 
examinations will be regular. 
  On February 5th Eduard Shevardnadze signed a decree which 
said that "the growing trend toward drug addiction jeopardizes 
people's health, poses a threat to national security, and 
discredits government institutions." In this connection a 
governmental commission was formed. It is led by Deputy Premier 
Irakly Menagarishvili. 
  The check-up will spread to other government institutions, 
above all to the Defence and Interior Ministries, some of whose 
members have been caught abusing or trafficking narcotics.

<F P=106> [Report by Besik Urigashvili: "Checks Confirmed: </F>
Shevardnadze Did Not Do Drugs"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The Georgian Health Ministry's drug 
service has carried out medical checks on members of the 
Georgian head of state's apparatus in order to flush out drug 
addicts there. Shevardnadze himself underwent a medical too. As 
might have been expected, no drug addicts were found in 
Shevardnadze's apparatus. 
  Ramaz Sakvarelidze, head of the Georgian leader's press 
service, made the following comment on this unusual event: Drug 
addiction has penetrated the state's structures of authority. 
This is one means of combating it. All officials in ministries 
and departments along with the personnel of the parliament and 
cabinet of ministers apparatuses will undergo similar checks. 
  The reason for the checks was the countless statements by 
Georgian parliamentarians to the effect that some members of the 
cabinet of ministers do drugs and are helping to form a drugs 
mafia in Georgia. At the same time the power ministries -- the 
Defense Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Affairs -- were 
the primary targets along with staffers in the apparatus of 
certain vice premiers. 
  We will leave aside the effectiveness of these actions, 
since 
any sensible person is aware that these checks will have zero 
results in practice. The moral aspect is far more important. 
And it is hard to disagree with the opinion voiced by 
parliament Deputy Ivlian Khaindrav, who says that the enforced 
nature of these checks is offensive. As for the propaganda 
nature of the action, in the current situation it can only 
impress Joe Public. 
  However, the problem of drug addiction in Georgia has indeed 
become menacing. Figures provided by the Georgian Internal 
Affairs Ministry Narcotics Administration demonstrate that the 
republic is one of the main staging posts for the international 
drug business. In the last few years there has been a 
considerable increase in drug use in Georgia itself. The 
country is now one of the world leaders in the field.

<F P=106> [Report by Tengiz Pachkoriya: "Caucasus Border District </F>
Department Redeploys From Tbilisi to Stavropol but Russian 
Border Guards Will Continue To Man the Turkish Border"] 
  [Text] A press conference for Georgian and foreign 
journalists on 17 March in the headquarters of the special 
Caucasian Border District in Tbilisi was devoted to the 
completion of this directorate's redeployment from Tbilisi to 
Stavropol. Lieutenant General Viktor Zemtsov, commander of the 
district, told the journalists that the redeployment was of a 
planned nature. Being moved together with the directorate are 
some of the district's subunits. Zemtsov underscored at the 
same time that all the groups of forces necessary for guarding 
the state border with Turkey will stay on the territory of 
Georgia. "We are not leaving Georgia and Armenia, our 
directorate is simply moving over to Stavropol," said Zemtsov, 
adding that the district is in charge, first, of the former USSR 
borders guarded by Russian Federation border guards; second, of 
the Russian Federation state border in the Northern Caucasus. 
Along this border, the guards will keep tabs on the movement of 
weapons, contraband, and drugs from Russia to other countries 
and vice versa. 
  The district was created in line with the Russian Federation 
president's edict of 1 March 1994. Before that there existed, 
for one year, a Northern Caucasus border district, which was 
known as the Transcaucasus border district until 1 March 1993. 
  On the morning of 17 March the commander met with Georgian 
leaders, in particular with Prime Minister Otari Patsatsiya, and 
expressed thanks to the Government of Georgia for understanding 
and support, for kind relationships. "We don't say 'goodbye,' 
we say 'see you again,' and we will continue guarding the state 
border." 
  Talking to journalists, Viktor Zemtsov remarked that 
residents of the Republic of Georgia will also serve in the 
Russian Federation border troops beginning this year. As early 
as this April or May, they will be first drafted for service in 
the Russian Federation border troops to guard the state border 
with Turkey. The number of draftees will be between 500 and 600 
men. In the future, he said, nearly 30 percent of the entire 
personnel of the Russian Federation border troops stationed in 
Georgia will be the republic's residents. Among them, there will 
be enlisted men, warrant officers, and officers. Drafting will 
be effected irrespective of the men's nationality: Georgians, 
Russians, Abkhaz, and others will be eligible. 
  Responding to questions relating to border control between 
Russia and Georgia, Zemtsov said that subunits and units of 
Russian Federation border troops are being deployed along the 
Psou River. Their missions in guarding the state border, in 
preventing the crossing from the Russian Federation into Georgia 
and vice versa of any groups of people and arms, have already 
been defined for them. He said he has some experience in 
checking up on and detaining groups that carried weapons from 
Russia to Abkhazia and back. 
  Thus, the district continues to perform its duties, and one 
should not create a stir about the district directorate's 
redeployment from Tbilisi to Stavropol.

<F P=106> [Report by Eduard Ediberidze: "In the Cabinet of Ministers. </F>
With the Aim of Stabilizing the Republic's Energy Supply"] 
  [Excerpt] It seems that the serious situation that took 
shape in the republic in winter due to the acute shortage of 
electric power is gradually returning to normal. Elimination of 
the consequences of the recent accident at the Tbilisi State 
Regional Power Station, the supply of natural gas and fuel oil 
from Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, in spite of the large debts 
that Georgia owes to these countries, and the spring high-water 
in the rivers, which has increased the seasonal output of 
hydro-electric stations, have enabled us to improve to some 
degree the supply of electric power to vitally important 
installations such as bakeries and hospitals and also to the 
population. During the last few days, the Tbilisi subway, 
though operating according to a strict schedule, has been 
functioning almost normally; it carries more than 90 percent of 
all passengers travelling in the Georgian capital. Trolleybuses 
have again started to operate along certain city lines. 
Telephone communications have been restored in most areas. 
However, there is still very much that needs to be done in 
order to achieve complete stability in the republic's electric 
power complex. As before, the new residential areas in Tbilisi 
and individual cities and rayons in the republic are permanently 
without electricity. Industrial enterprises remain idle, while 
expecting a change in the electric power situation.... 
  This was a topic of discussion at the regular session of the 
Georgian Cabinet of Ministers Presidium under the chairmanship 
of Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia that was held on 9 March. The 
main point on the agenda was the question of urgent measures 
aimed at stabilizing the situation that has taken shape in the 
republic's electric power complex. A thorough analysis of both 
the objective and subjective reasons that have given rise to the 
crisis in this most important branch has enabled us to elaborate 
a concrete program aimed at bringing it out of this serious 
situation and creating real preconditions for a radical 
improvement in energy supplies to the economic complex and the 
population during the autumn and winter of 1994-95. It is 
planned to increase the production of electric power this year 
to 11-12 billion kilowatt hours; at the same time, compared with 
last year, the rate of increase amounts to 112.2 percent. In 
order to implement this program, it has been decided to allocate 
3.5 billion rubles to this branch from the credits received by 
Georgia; this money will go, first and foremost, on repairing 
the equipment at the Tbilisi State Regional Hydro-Power Station 
and the Inguri Hydro-Power Station and on increasing the level 
of production. In accordance with the adopted decree, the 
appropriate instructions have been given to the "Sakenergo" 
[Georgian electric power production and consumption] department 
and other departments and ministries, the heads of enterprises 
and organizations, and the republic's town and rayon local 
administrative bodies in order to bring the branch out of the 
crisis. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "One-Quarter of Tbilisians Believe </F>
That the Republic's Authorities Are Consciously Harming the 
Republic"] 
  [Text] The current authorities of the Republic of 
Georgia... 
  are concerned with their own well-being -- 36.7 percent; 
  are concerned with the well-being of the republic -- 28.1 
percent; 
  are consciously harming the republic -- 24.5 percent; 
  difficult to say -- 10.7 percent. 
  The above poll was conducted by the REZONANSI Sociological 
Service in Tbilisi on 20-21 February. There were 500 
respondents. 
  It is the view of 36.7 percent of Tbilisians that the 
republic's leaders are using their positions to organize their 
own personal lives. 
  It has to be said that the view expressed by this 61 percent 
of the capital's residents cannot be far from the truth as, 
otherwise, it turns out that Georgia is being led by people who 
are mentally retarded. If we take into account the superfluous 
number of leaders, it is impossible for so many people to have 
ended up in one place by chance, unless, of course, they were 
specially gathered. One can undoubtedly point out the criminal 
action or lack of action of the leader and the heads of 
Parliament and government as a result of which they are 
condemning a large part of the population to starvation. In a 
country where almost all products are sold at world prices, the 
minimum wage amounts to 17 American cents. 
  It also has to be said that, given the excessive size of the 
apparatus of state officials and their visibly small salaries, 
the republic's leaders are intentionally pushing them toward 
corruption. Corruption instituted from the top -- in the police, 
the Procurator's Office and judicial bodies, and also in 
structures of local administration -- is having and will have 
particularly serious consequences. 
  It is suspected that the damage being done to the republic 
was premeditated, as was the fact that, following ratification 
of Georgia's membership of the CIS, there was an amazing change 
overnight in the provision of electric power, water, and 
transport to the population. Regarding the supply of electric 
power, prior to ratification of the CIS statutes, the situation 
prevailing in Georgia was more catastrophic than that in Armenia 
in the winter of 1992-93, which, for Armenia, had been the worst 
winter since the outbreak of the war in Nagorno-Karabakh. At 
that time, Georgia was the only source of electric power for 
Armenia and, in spite of this, the population was being supplied 
with electric power regularly and according to schedule and the 
subway was functioning normally. 
  Moreover, prior to ratification of the CIS statutes, the 
following situation prevailed in Rustavi [important industrial 
city south-east of Tbilisi]: A large part of the town had been 
completely without any electricity and water for three weeks. 
The population (as in Varketili) [suburb of Tbilisi] had closed 
the road that needed to be cleaned by the authorities (if we are 
to believe the rumors being circulated, the city's mayor 
Areshidze was telling them that they had wanted democracy and 
this was it). 
  Following ratification of the CIS statutes, the supply of 
both electric power and water was restored.

  [Text] Vilnius, March 17, ELTA -- NATO Military Committee 
Chairman Richard Vincent on a visit in Lithuania met with 
Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas on Thursday [17 March]. 
They discussed the "Partnership for Peace" programme, its 
practical aspects which guaranteed security. 
  Vincent emphasized that the programme was very broad, but, 
unfortunately, in the undestanding of many political figures it 
was encompassing only the cooperation in military sphere. 
  Vincent noted that the most important thing in the programme 
was the identity of both political and human virtues because 
post-communist countries joined the agreement. The programme 
"Partnership for Peace" was the adaptation period for the 
countries which sought NATO membership. During the period the 
aspiring countries would be observed by the Western countries in 
order to be sure they would orient themselves towards Western 
values, Vincent said. 
  Brazauskas also admitted that "Partnership for Peace" was 
considered as the process of acquiring NATO membership. 
Brazauskas approved Russia's decision to join the programme. 
It would be the greatest achievement in the meantime, if Russia 
signed the documents of the "Partnership for Peace" programme 
and took part in it with the same status like all other 
countries, Brazauskas noted.

  [Text] Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Minister Povilas Gylys is 
leaving for Warsaw today where he intends to initial the 
Lithuanian-Polish treaty on friendly relations and 
good-neighborly cooperation tomorrow. 
  Lithuanian and Polish experts finished editing the text of 
the draft treaty last week. 
  The Nationalist Union Board has proposed in an appeal to 
President Algirdas Brazauskas, published today, that the main 
passages of the treaty be discussed without delay with all 
Lithuanian parties having representatives in the Seimas. The 
president is asked to take the initiative and reach agreement in 
this vitally important common national issue. 
  The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stressed in a 
statement that it rejects any pressure as an attempt to 
influence the course of negotiations and complicate mutual 
relations between states. It points out that in a democratic 
state trust in the quality of work by the diplomatic service is 
confirmed by the ratifying of signed agreements in parliament, 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Vladislovas Domarkas said today in 
an 
interview with Lithuanian radio that the contents of the present 
draft treaty should guarantee that there will be no territorial 
claims between the two states and that national minorities in 
the two states will behave in accordance with the laws of the 
state where they reside. The states, for their part, are 
obliged, in accordance with international standards, to 
guarantee corresponding rights to national minorities. This 
treaty, undoubtedly, will not bar the way to the further 
examination of sensitive issues. Historians and public 
organizations will be able to continue their discussions on the 
past, but these discussions and the analysis of history must not 
put the lid on the future. On the contrary, we should pay more 
attention to joint work in the economy, culture, education, and 
other spheres so that we can join Europe as soon as possible, 
Vladislovas Domarkas said, concluding his interview. 
  After the Lithuanian-Polish treaty has been initialled in 
Warsaw on Friday, it is due to be signed by the Lithuanian and 
Polish presidents during their forthcoming meeting.

<F P=106> [Statement by the LDDP Council Presidium and the LDDP Seimas </F>
faction] 
  [Text] Recently, Lithuanian Center Union Chairman R. 
Ozolas made several statements which, in our opinion, 
deteriorate Lithuania's interstate relations, the development of 
friendly ties with neighboring countries, and instigate ethnic 
minorities residing in Lithuania. 
  The assessment of separate foreign ambassadors [reference to 
Polish and Belarusian envoys] working in Lithuania is another 
attempt to complicate our relations with neighbors, the process 
of negotiations, and the signing of agreements on friendship and 
cooperation. 
  The Presidium of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party 
[LDDP] 
Council and the LDDP Seimas [parliament] faction categorically 
disagree with the moves of Seimas Deputy R. Ozolas. We believe 
that such actions not only fail to protect the interests of the 
state and the nation, as they are often interpreted, but are 
even damaging to them. Nationalism and the scoring of 
historical accounts are outdated matters in today's Europe, 
impeding the construction of a common European home.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 17, BNS -- The political treaty 
between Lithuania and Poland is not a responsibility of a single 
party, even the party in power, but a concern of the entire 
Lithuanian nation, the Board of the Lithuanian Union of 
Nationalists (LUN) said Thursday [17 March]. 
  In an address to President Algirdas Brazauskas, the LUN 
suggested to discuss the basic principles of the treaty with all 
political parties represented in the parliament. 
  The union asks the president to "take the initiative and to 
achieve a general agreement on this vitally important" problem.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 17, BNS -- One more border incident 
involving armed Russian servicemen occurred on the 
Lithuanian-Russian border this week. 
  An armed Russian convoy escorting governmental mail was 
taken-off a Moscow-Kaliningrad train because the Russians did 
not have permission to carry weapons on Lithuanian territory. 
Lithuanian border guards disarmed the Russian soldiers and 
handed them over to the police. 
  The convoys explained that they were supposed to deliver the 
mail by plane, but their flight was canceled and they had to 
take a train. The Russians were given back their weapons and 
were allowed to board another train. 
  Colonel Pranas Dragunaitis, head of the Lithuanian Border 
Defense Service, discussed the incident with representatives of 
the Russian troops stationed in the Kaliningrad region. 
Dragunaitis emphasized the need to put a stop to violations of 
armed servicemen transit regulations. 
  The Lithuanian official said the rules of transporting 
weapons through Lithuanian territory must be strictly observed. 
He noted that Lithuanian border guards will never make any 
concessions to anybody and will always act in accordance with 
the law.

<F P=106> [Report by Remigijus Barauskas: "A Dangerous Load in </F>
Radviliskis"] 
  [Text] Seventeen cisterns with almost 900 tonnes of 
methanol have been detained at the Radviliskis railway station 
since last Thursday [3 March]. The attempts of a Russian firm 
to ship this load through Lithuania to Germany failed for the 
second time. 
  Our customs officials detained the train for the first time 
on 6 January at the Vaidotai station. Since the consignor had 
no permit from the Environmental Protection Department, 
Lithuanian officials turned the train back. After the attempt 
to bring the methanol in from Belarus had failed, the firm tried 
to do this from Latvia's territory. On Thursday, the cisterns 
arrived from Daugavpils to Radviliskis. From there they had to 
travel to the port of Klaipeda, and later by the Mukran ferry to 
Germany. However, Lithuanian customs officials detained the 
load again. 
  According to F. Stankevicius, senior inspector of the 
Customs 
Work Organization Division at the Customs Department, Lithuania 
is currently negotiating with the Latvians on the return of the 
methanol. However, Latvia does not yet want to accept the load 
that is dangerous to the environment.

  [Text] The management of Lithuanian Radio and TV has 
officially announced the partial curtailment of the relay of the 
Ostankino TV channel if Ostankino does not pay its debt to 
Lithuanian communications men by the beginning of April. The 
decision has been taken, ANI agency notes, despite the fact that 
the Ostankino TV channel is the only Russian TV channel relayed 
throughout Lithuania and has the highest rating in the republic. 
According to the calculations of Lithuanian communications men, 
the debt of the transmitting station in Moscow equals 
approximately 1 billion lits or $250,000. Evidently it is 
appropriate to remember that in all civilized countries of the 
world it is the receiving side that pays for the transmission of 
broadcasts but in our country it is the other way round.

  [Text] At today's press conference in the Seimas, the 
chairman of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction, 
Justinas Karosas, who has been reelected in his post, and other 
members of the ruling party faction were telling about closed 
meetings which examined the faction's work. According to 
Justinas Karosas, it is possible to state that the Lithuanian 
Democratic Labor Party had succeeded in realizing a consistent 
political orientation. Some social democratic programs have not 
been implemented. 
  According the leader of the faction, the maneuvering by the 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party between liberalism and social 
democracy is adequate. Speaking of the problems of work by the 
party, Justinas Karosas mentioned lack of coordination of 
actions. Therefore it has been decided to form working groups of 
the representatives of the faction, the president's office and 
the government which will coordinate the reception of foreign 
guests. Justinas Karosas accentuated that the matter concerns 
only legislation and there are no attempts to influence all 
actions by the government. 
  Amendments to the faction's statute have been discussed at 
the meetings. This document will deal more in detail not only 
with the formation of the faction but also of the whole Seimas 
leadership.

issue of just representation in the UN Security Council, and 
expanding its membership. He emphasized that the current 
composition of the UN Security Council, as well as its operation 
under the current multitude of work, requires that its number be 
increased, and that new regional circumstances and new 
participants in international relations be considered. 
  The implementation of this proposal would significantly 
improve the productivity level of the council that is a body 
acting in the name of all UN members, according to its statute 
responsibilities. At the same time, it is necessary to preserve 
all [words indistinct], to ensure that it immediately reacts to 
situations that require intervention, examining them, and 
adopting appropriate decisions. It is important to find 
compromises to resolve questions of membership in the Security 
Council, which would be acceptable to all countries, including 
the council's permanent members.

  [Text] Russian Ambassador to Ukraine Leonid Smolyakov has 
voiced Russia's deep concern over the public statements by some 
Ukrainian diplomats in third countries on Russia's foreign 
policy and Russo-Ukrainian relations. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Kiev, Yevgeny Tyurin, 
told Interfax-Ukraine Thursday [17 March] that Smolyakov had 
drawn the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's attention to the 
"anti-Russian" lecture given by the Ukrainian ambassador to 
Canada, Viktor Batyuk, at the University of Ottawa. According 
to Russian sources, Batyuk described Russia's foreign policy as 
"undeclared cold war against Ukraine aimed at destabilizing its 
internal political situation" and that of Ukraine towards Russia 
as "anti-imperial." 
  The Russian diplomat said "such statements and other 
unfriendly actions" of this kind do not contribute to the 
development of Russo-Ukrainian relations in the context of 
agreements reached by the two countries' presidents and do not 
strengthen their good-neighborly relations in accordance with 
the foreign policy guidelines passed by the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Horban] </F>
  [Text] I will recall the words President Meri said 
immediately after arriving on Ukrainian land: Nobody has ever 
canceled the agreement on friendship and cooperation that was 
signed between Estonia and Ukraine as early as 1921. This 
visit, the Estonian president emphasized, is a continuation of 
our friendly contacts. 
  A similar agreement was signed in 1992, and the talks that 
have recently been held have resulted in another three 
documents, including two agreements on scientific-technical and 
cultural cooperation, an agreement on travel without visas for 
people who have diplomatic passports, and a protocol on mutual 
consultations between the Ukrainian and Estonian Foreign 
Ministries. The results of the visit were summarized at a joint 
news conference held by Lennart Meri and Leonid Kravchuk. 
  [Begin recording] [Meri, in Russian] We see that there are 
very favorable conditions for improving our partnership with 
Ukraine not only in issues of security and foreign policy, but 
also in economy, which is fundamental for any country. We have 
openly discussed this with the president [Kravchuk]. The same 
issue was addressed at a meeting with the Ukrainian parliament 
and during negotiations. 
  [Kravchuk, in Russian] Documents that have just been signed 
indicate that Estonia and Ukraine are willing to deepen their 
cooperation in the main spheres of life, primarily in the 
economy, and that we have common opinions on European and global 
problems, as well as that we have agreed on our positions 
regarding international relations and have defined ways for 
finding resolutions. The visit by the Estonian president to 
Ukraine is indeed important, and it is aimed -- and I am 
convinced that this will happen -- at improvement and expansion 
of our friendship and partnership. [end recording] 
  One of the journalists' questions concerned both presidents' 
opinions on the division of representative and executive 
authorities. The Estonian president replied that the new 
Constitution regulates this issue in his country. The 
responsibilities of both the government and the parliament are 
precisely defined. Leonid Kravchuk, in this regard, said as 
follows: I want to find a common language with the new 
parliament which is to be elected soon. This, however, depends 
not only on me. If the new Supreme Council, said Leonid 
Kravchuk, approves the orientation toward a market economy and 
building of a new democratic state, I will be supportive and 
constructively cooperative with it. 
  The so-called issue of the Russian-speaking population was 
also addressed by the journalists. In this regard, Lennart Meri 
said that certain Russian politicians use the issue of 
respecting human rights in former USSR republics cynically, and 
that it is often used as a political instrument to pressure 
them. It would be better, the Estonian president said, if those 
people found the time and straightened out the issue of human 
rights in Russia. In the opinion of the Ukrainian president, 
this problem can be solved, however, only in a democratic manner.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 
1439 GMT on 17 March broadcasts a report by Kiev correspondent 
Vladimir Sokolov who reports on the official visit of Estonian 
President Lennart Meri to Ukraine. 
  Vladimir Sokolov begins his report by saying: "Concluding 
the 
visit, Presidents Lennart Meri and Leonid Kravchuk held a news 
conference for national and foreign journalists. They both 
pointed out that their talks were very friendly and that their 
was a coincidence of views on all issues. Lennart Meri stressed 
that Estonia and Ukraine had very similar problems of building 
statehood and of economic and social development following the 
acquisition of sovereignty and independence. However, Estonia 
has already overcome the most difficult period of the 
establishment of its economic and political independence, and 
has now entered a stage of all-round stabilization. 
  "Although the relevant agreements have been signed, economic 
ties with Ukraine are not yet sufficient. As for economic ties, 
Ukraine occupies only sixth or seventh place among Estonia's 
partner states which, of course, is far from meeting the 
potential for mutually beneficial exchange and new measures have 
been outlined for expanding and intensifying cooperation." 
  Sokolov continues: "Replying to a question from journalists, 
Leonid Kravchuk stressed that the talks touched on both the 
national security of the two countries and also their 
participation in strengthening international security. There 
was also a question about Leonid Kravchuk's attitude to the 
decree by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov on holding a poll of 
the population on three issues. Leonid Kravchuk noted that he 
had suspended this decree only with regard to the holding of a 
referendum in the guise of a poll, and to the question on dual 
citizenship contained in it, since only the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine could decide such an issue. As for Meshkov's decree 
itself, he described it as a step toward unwanted confrontation 
and voiced the hope that common sense will prevail. Today, 
President Lennart Meri and officials accompanying him left Kiev 
for home."

<F P=106> [Oleg Odnokolenko article: "We Will Not Reinstate in Its </F>
Old Form the Union Which We Have Lost"] 
  [Text] This memorable date will hardly be celebrated on an 
official level. But, be that as it may, it marks a truly 
historic event: Exactly three years ago, 17 March, the former 
Soviet people voted by an overwhelming majority to preserve the 
unified state -- the USSR. What happened next and how the 
experience of the first Russian referendum ultimately ended is 
well known. It would, of course, be possible to say quite a few 
spiteful things about those who like to "consult with the 
people." Nevertheless, the following nuance appears more 
noteworthy: Some time later the same people who had said "yes" 
to the Union voted equally readily for independence, this time 
at a regional level. 
  ...We became witnesses to and participants in the notorious 
sovereignty bandwagon. On departing, each republic took with it 
as much freedom, economics, politics, security, and even 
religion as it wanted. The former Union territory became the 
most "president-intensive" in the world. 
  But now sociologists, sounding out public opinion among the 
dwellers of the ruins of the "evil empire," once again present 
us with sensational statistics: It turns out that the 
overwhelming majority of former Soviet citizens are now, once 
again, not averse to living beneath the same roof. And not just 
the ordinary men in the street! Even well-known politicians 
among the most frenzied radicals weep publicly for the 
"prematurely deceased USSR." 
  Not that these tears will be believed any longer not only in 
Moscow but even, probably, in Uryupinsk. It is all easily 
explained: Separatism is now an unpopular field. Nobody, not 
even the citizens of the "small but proud" Baltic republics, has 
benefited from the partition and breakup. Of the entire former 
Soviet population only the local elites -- leadership, 
financial, entertainment -- are prospering. Previously they too 
were ordinary Aeroflot passengers, but now they fly in their own 
airplanes with a retinue and "retainers." Former party workers, 
former commodity experts, former minor but cunning officials, 
unremarkable officers.... Surely the purport of that all-Union 
shake-up was not just that a band should play at the airport for 
someone and a saber be waved about? 
  Oh, how strong our people are, nonetheless, with hindsight! 
How trustful! First they were prepared to follow Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov's white cloak into the boundless sea of 
independence, now they look somewhat too suspiciously upon the 
"political" beard of Aleksandr Rutskoy.... Again no good will 
come of it.... They would like very much not to be disappointed 
again. Three whole years have passed, nonetheless! Russia is 
no longer the same, and the entire post-Soviet area has greatly 
changed. So we ask revolutionary gentlemen not to worry: A 
return to the old ways is simply impossible. We must build our 
common home anew and seek paths to unification anew -- to 
effective unification which infringes nobody's interests. We 
have already lived for long enough in states where everything -- 
from the economy to the borders -- is conventional, and it is 
time we thought seriously about the future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Buds Are Swelling: An Omen of a </F>
Coup?"] 
  [Text] What are the founding fathers afraid of? 
  On 17 March, a group of fairly well known persons announced 
in Moscow the creation of a new public movement: "Accord for 
Russia." The founding fathers include: Valeriy Zorkin, 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Mikhail Lapshin, Petr 
Romanov, Aman Tuleyev, Sergey Glazyev, Sergey Baburin, Vasiliy 
Lipitskiy, Aleksandr Tsipko, and others. The list remains open; 
the movement is ready to admit anyone who is concerned over 
Russia's fate. At present, the movement's founders themselves 
are worried most of all by the threat of "a junta-style palace 
coup." Valeriy Zorkin said at the new movement's first press 
conference: "The signs of a coup are evident. Currently, 
analytical memos of this sort have been drawn up and are 
circulating, various coup theories are under discussion. 
Something similar occurred on the eve of 20 March and 21 
September of last year. It is well known that subsequently the 
forecasts spelled out in the analytical memos proved to be 
correct." Zorkin's fears were shared by Gennadiy Zyuganov. 
  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has managed to obtain an analytical memo. 
(It is published in a slightly abridged form.) 
  Confidentially 
  Theory 1 
  (according to information as of 16 March 1994) 
  Attention! Upon the emergence of a new theory the previous 
ones are discarded. 
  According to available information, a group of statesmen -- 
First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets, General Staff Chief M. 
Kolesnikov, and Moscow Mayor Y. Luzhkov -- plan to make an 
attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin. V. Shumeyko, M. Poltoranin, B. 
Mikhaylov, chairman of the Russian Federation committee on the 
press (apparently B. Mironov -- editorial board), reportedly 
also belong to the group... Those listed above have already 
held tentative talks with P. Grachev, V. Yerin, and S. 
Stepashin, and by employing various arguments managed to obtain 
their agreement not to take countermeasures. In addition, B. 
Mikhaylov is currently trying to establish contacts with Ye. 
Primakov's inner circle. A pretext for launching the action 
should be an address by a prominent public figure or an 
industrialist on the "Ostankino" first television channel 
putting forward the initiative in question and giving as reasons 
the deterioration of the president's health and his physical 
inability to run the country. To substantiate the argument, a 
television documentary should be shown portraying the president 
as a man of poor health and a heavy drinker at that. Then the 
aforementioned statesmen plan to initiate through their allies 
at the State Duma the constitutional procedure of handing 
provisional presidential powers over to V. Chernomyrdin so as to 
hold emergency presidential elections in the country within the 
next three months. The chiefs and activists of the Russian 
Federation Communist Party State Duma faction are aware of the 
group's plans, and Chernomyrdin's assumption of power suits 
them, but they are displeased with the presence of Yu. Luzhkov 
in the group. 
  According to available reports, the action is scheduled to 
be 
carried out in March, the deadline is April of this year. 
Considered as a preliminary option is the imposition of a state 
of emergency or some elements of it, possibly on limited 
territories, under the pretext of the difficult economic 
situation and the struggle against crime. 
  The first attempt to start the action was made 10 March -- 
on 
that day Yu. Skokov was scheduled to made a television address 
and a corresponding documentary was to be shown. Typically, V. 
Chernomyrdin himself left on that day for Nizhniy Novgorod and 
then set out for Finland. P. Grachev was in Germany at the 
time. The attempt fell through, however, because A. Yakovlev, 
chief of the "Ostankino" State Television and Radio Company, 
refused to accord television air time and advised the 
president's inner circle of the intentions. Immediately 
afterward, a number of those who were directly or indirectly 
involved in the action left Moscow: Yu. Skokov for Germany, M. 
Kolesnikov for France (he will return on 16 March). S. 
Stepashin was hospitalized. 
  On that same week when the unsuccessful attempt to depose 
Boris Yeltsin was made and also during the preceding two or 
three weeks a whole range of politicians, primarily those in 
opposition to the president, made statements about the need for 
Boris Yeltsin to resign one way or another and for early 
presidential elections to be held... Former British Prime 
Minister Edward Heath and former U.S. President Richard Nixon 
have visited Moscow to meet with domestic party leaders in order 
to figure out the alignment of political forces and plans with 
regard to future presidential elections. 
  Despite the initial failure, the group of the 
aforementioned statesmen have not given up their plans to depose 
Boris Yeltsin by using an approximately similar plan of action. 
Currently, talks are under way with R. Vyakhirev, chief of the 
Gazprom joint-stock company, to persuade him to deliver an 
address Yu. Skokov failed to make. 
  Given that, it is noteworthy that P. Grachev has postponed 
his working visit to the Leningrad Military District, which was 
scheduled for 14 March. This was done at the eleventh hour, 
when airplanes with a Defense Ministry delegation and a group of 
journalists had already left for St. Petersburg... On the 
whole, the Armed Forces leadership can be divided into two 
groups: Boris Yeltsin's "loyalists," who have repeatedly 
expressed their commitment to the incumbent president, including 
P. Grachev and his first deputy, G. Kondratyev; and the 
"opposition" represented by General Staff Chief M. Kolesnikov 
and Deputy Defense Minister A. Kokoshin. According to available 
information, Deputy Defense Minister A. Kokoshin maintains close 
ties with O. Soskovets; he regularly does various services to 
him, his deputies, and relatives. A. Kokoshin and O. Soskovets 
meet virtually twice or three times a week. 
  On 15 March, from 1700 to 1800 P. Grachev met with V. 
Chernomyrdin. The subject of the meeting has not been 
disclosed. The very fact of its taking place has not been 
publicized. 
<H5>  What this might mean... </H5>
  The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board has asked Aleksandr 
Yakovlev, chairman of the Federal Television and Radio Service, 
whether Yuriy Skokov was indeed scheduled to make a television 
address. Aleksandr Nikolayevich said that Skokov did not 
approach him in that regard, but there was a "sideways" phone 
call that warned Yakovlev that such an address was being planned. 
  Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the All-Russian State Television 
and Radio Company, has also received a phone call: ARGUMENTY I 
FAKTY's correspondent asked him to explain why Russian 
television denied Yuriy Skokov air time. 
  To all appearances, we are dealing with a clear 
mystification, an anonymous letter, nothing more. And a fairly 
rough fabrication at that. The authors' bottom line is only too 
evident: to compromise a number of the president's closest 
allies, such as Yuriy Luzhkov, to smear the "power" ministers, 
to sideline promising politicians by, say, resuscitating "the 
Skokov threat" -- in a word, to plunge into a regular palace 
intrigue. This should not, however, be dismissed as an 
innocuous joke. In principle, a coup d'etat or something of the 
kind may well be organized this way, too: by "warming up" the 
situation, pitting influential politicians against each other, 
ratcheting up the psychosis of universal suspiciousness and 
provoking the authorities into taking inadequate "security 
measures." This is a technology in the struggle for power. 
Definitely, a dirty one. But everyone struggles as one can.

<F P=106> [Viktor Badurkin report: "Army on Brink of Poverty"] </F>
  [Text] At yesterday's briefing Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev described as critical the situation regarding 
funding of the army. The amount the state owes to the military 
department no longer increases by the year but by the month. 
While it totaled 5 percent of the military budget at the end of 
1992, it was 25 percent in December last year, and at the 
beginning of this year the Defense Ministry received only 63 
percent of planned appropriations. This money was scarcely 
sufficient to pay half the amount owed to suppliers of 
equipment, arms, and property. 
  For the first time the Russian defense minister declared 
that 
"If the funding situation does not change in the near future, 
there can be no question not only of reforming the army, 
providing it with modern weapons and equipment, and a 
qualitative renewal, but also of ensuring Russia's security." 
  This -- let us say bluntly -- sensational statement by the 
head of the military department was prompted by the fact that 
the military budget being proposed by the Finance Ministry meets 
only 46-47 percent of the army and navy's minimum requirements. 
If it is adopted the Defense Ministry will have to sharply cut 
(by three-fourths) military orders at defense enterprises, which 
in turn will lead to the defense sector's final collapse, a fall 
in industrial production as a whole, and increased unemployment. 
In addition, what is inevitably the latest wholesale reduction 
of the armed forces by 400,000 men, which will have a boomerang 
effect on the army's combat readiness and the state budget 
(discharging 70,000 servicemen now costs the treasury a trillion 
rubles), will also lead to an explosion of social tension among 
the troops.

<F P=106> [Fiammetta Cucurnia report on interview with Defense </F>
Minister Pavel Grachev by unidentified reporters in Moscow; date 
not given: "Grachev: Russian Army Loyal to Constitution"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- The reporters examined him carefully, as 
though trying to read his most hidden thoughts. They considered 
him the key figure in this Moscow again enveloped in a climate 
of conspiracies, where there is again talk about troops being on 
a state of alert and about coups, as there was three years ago 
and again last summer. But Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense 
minister, who received his American counterpart William Perry 
yesterday morning, announcing that "Moscow will be ready by the 
end of March to join the program of cooperation for peace put 
forward by NATO," displayed great confidence, made quips, and 
tried to play matters down. "As long as I am in charge of the 
Army," he said, "there will be no military dictatorship." 
According to the general, the real problems facing the Russian 
Army, heir to the Red Army, are of a different kind -- a 
starvation budget, allocations "entirely insufficient not only 
for carrying out any reform but even for ensuring Russia's 
security." And it is only because of this, he said, "that I 
will struggle." 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] General Grachev, everyone has been talking 
about a coup for weeks now. And Zhirinovskiy even went as far 
as to suggest a date -- by the summer. What do you think? 
  [Grachev] I have heard enough about this business of a coup. 
We must stop fighting, otherwise soon we will not have anything 
left to eat. Now is the time to build. But I understand your 
question. You want to know what the Army would do in the event 
of a coup. And I will tell you that we are impartial. The Army 
makes a stand, as you have seen, only if it fears the start of a 
civil war. It cannot permit that. But as for the rest -- 
protests, disorder, demonstrations, or whatever else -- never: 
There are other bodies that must deal with that. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] And yet we often hear it said that amid so 
much chaos, in order to avert the worst and to try to govern the 
transitional stage without bloodshed, the possibility of a 
"government of discipline," with the Army's backing, may not be 
such a remote one. 
  [Grachev] I think that the military must do its job and 
nothing more. It seems to me that absolutely nothing good can 
be expected if the Army starts leading the economy or 
agriculture. As long as I am defense minister, there will be no 
military dictatorships, and we will honor the Constitution. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] In the corridors of Parliament there are 
rumors circulating that Moscow's garrisons have been on a state 
of alert for several days. What can you tell us in this regard? 
  [Grachev] That it is nonsense. Around Moscow there are only 
two major units that can really be placed on a state of alert 
and used for a military operation. They are the Tamanskaya and 
the Kantimirovskiya. The other troops are still at the training 
stage. So it is very easy to check how matters stand. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You said that the Army's real major problem 
in the present stage is an economic one, which threatens to have 
serious political developments. Could you explain that to us 
better? 
  [Grachev] I will simply tell you that the Finance Ministry 
has planned an allocation for military expenditures more or less 
equivalent to 46-47 percent of what we are asking for. I do not 
want to make any threats, nor do I intend to humiliate myself by 
begging. At government meetings I put forward concrete figures 
so that it is clear where such a policy could lead us. Our 
budget for 1994 was corrected in an attempt to tackle, first, 
the social problems of 120,000 homeless officers, thousands of 
people without jobs. This will consume 56 percent of our 
resources. At the same time, we cannot reduce beyond a certain 
point cash expenditure on technological and military 
modernization. But unless the Finance Ministry yields, we will 
be able to purchase only 25 percent of the weapons planned, 
which means the collapse of the military industries and an army 
of unemployed men. Not to mention scientific research. It would 
be really unfair to level charges of excessive militarization 
now. We are asking for the minimum. This, because we are now 
very close to the threshold that cannot be crossed, from the 
viewpoint of the country's security and of the social problems 
within the Armed Forces. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] General Grachev, you often talk abut the 
need 
to have a smaller Army, but one composed of "professionals." 
However, many people accuse you of being rather slow in 
implementing this reform. It is as though, after an initial 
stage of demoralization, Russia were again thinking about a 
policy of domination. 
  [Grachev] We no longer need 4-5 million men under arms now. 
But there is a limit that it is dangerous to exceed when you are 
concerned about the country's security interests and social 
problems. This year we made reductions of 200,000, not 400,000, 
as some would have liked. In general, specialists are agreed 
that the Russian Army must have at least 1.9 million soldiers. 
No more, but no less either, keeping in mind our country's 
special geopolitical situation. At present we have only 120,000 
men bound to the Army by contract.

  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- The Russian military space 
forces launched "Cosmos-2274" satellite with "Soyuz-5" carrier 
rocket from the Russian cosmodrome in Plesetsk at 19:30 Moscow 
time on Thursday. 
  According to the press centre of the military space forces, 
the launch was successful. 
  The space apparatus is moving at an orbit close to the 
estimated [sentence as received]. Its movements are monitored 
by the main centre for testing and controlling space apparatuses 
based in Golitsyno-2, a town in the Moscow region. The centre 
is a structural unit of the Russian military space forces.

  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Although work is just 
beginning in Russia's new Far Eastern spaceport of Svobodniy, 
specialists are thinking about its future uses. 
  According to Aleksey Krysanov, department chief at the 
General Machine-Building Design Bureau, which is charged with 
designing the new space port, the feasibility study of the new 
space centre will be completed before the end of 1994. 
  The preliminary plans provide for these of first two and 
then 
five silos for launching light booster rockets of the Rokot 
(Rumbler) type and two new launch pads for the lift-off of the 
heavy Angara-24 boosters. 
  No huge outlays are required for the first launches of the 
Rokot missiles -- specialists will do with two of the several 
tens of silos left behind by the military missile division which 
was disbanded under the START II agreement last autumn after 
serving the country's defenses since 1968. The silos, measuring 
more than 20 meters in depth and 4.2 meters across, some 
equipment and the control room as well as the life-support 
system were also left intact after the military took away their 
"toys." Some new equipment has to be installed and launches for 
peaceful purposes can begin. 
  Rokot missiles can be launched from the silos. Two launches 
have already been effected from Baykonur. After some 
modifications the missiles, earlier used for defence purposes, 
will lift off light military and civilian satellites. 
  Aleksey Krysanov stressed that the missile division used to 
occupy an area of several tens of square kilometers. The new 
spaceport will need less land. The remainder will be 
re-cultivated before being returned to civilian authorities.

  [Text] Work to create a new Russian space launching ground 
is beginning at Svobodnyy in Amur Oblast. Specialists are 
thinking through its prospects. The head of the general 
machine-building design bureau, (?Aleksey Prusanov), said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS that a feasibility study for the entire 
complex will be ready by the end of 1994. The document will 
envisage the use of initially two and subsequently five silos 
for launching light booster rockets, and the creation of two 
launchpads for heavy booster rockets. A missile division used 
to be stationed on the site where the cosmodrome is being built. 
The site will be several times smaller in size after it has been 
converted for its new purpose. The reclaimed land will be 
returned to the state.

missile division which operated here, to start space 
explorations," he added. Besides, many servicemen and missile 
specialists will remain at the cosmodrome to work, he noted. 
  Venediktov sees his main task in preparing the cosmodrome 
for 
operations and in providing it with adequate equipment. 
  The reduction of the missile division which was on duty in 
Svobodniy-18, started in 1992 under the START II Treaty. The 
last regiment was released from duty here less than a month ago. 
  The cosmodrome needs twice the number of commissioned 
officers now, but the new tasks have to be tackled with the 
present personnel. Venediktov hopes that new specialists will 
come here, including graduates from the Mozhayskiy Military 
Space Engineering Academy.

  [Text] Conversion is entering the life of the Russian 
Plesetsk cosmodrome increasingly widely. The Arkhangelsk Oblast 
newspaper VOLNA reports that last year regular launches of 
launch vehicles made on the basis of combat ICBM's. Thus with 
the aid of the new "Start I" launch vehicle an experimental 
electronic mail satellite was put into orbit. 
  In all last year 36 space vehicles were launched from the 
world's northernmost cosmodrome, only eight of them in the 
interests of the Defense Ministry. This year's program includes 
the launch of the new "Koronas" geophysical satellite which will 
continue the study of the polar aurora in the upper strata of 
the atmosphere and will begin regular observations of the Sun. 
And the "Okean" satellite will search for shoals of fish and 
investigate the ice on Arctic shipping routes.

  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- There can no longer be quick 
and popular solutions in the economy, Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said. 
  In his speech to the Federation Council, the upper house of 
Russia's new parliament, on Thursday Chernomyrdin said that 
after steep price rises in January "inflationary processes have 
slightly slowed down." In February inflation was about ten per 
cent. In 1993 the number of people living beyond the 
subsistence level shrank twofold. Presently, there are 25 
million such people in Russia. 
  However, the situation in the country "remains extremely 
complex on the whole," the premier continued. He blamed this on 
the continuing production decline which causes stoppages in the 
work of industrial enterprises. As a result of such stoppages 
22 million man-days were lost at 4,000 enterprises in February. 
  Chernomyrdin believes stoppages are caused by "difficulties 
in selling finished products." They account for the loss of 58 
per cent of working time. One third of losses is caused by the 
shortage of material resources, six per cent "are connected with 
the conversion of the defence complex." 
  He said it would be "premature and inappropriate" to feel 
elated about the decrease in inflation. The main problems in 
the economy "are directly connected with non-payments which are 
the most vivid indicator of the depth and intensity of crisis 
processes." As of March 1, 1994, "overdue credit debts exceeded 
25 trillion roubles. Overdue debit debts totalled about 32 
trillion rouble," he said. 
  There are several factors behind the problem of 
non-payments, 
the prime minister explained. Among them he named "debts of CIS 
republics to the fuel and energy complex," "uncontrolled money 
movement" and "inability of many heads of industrial enterprises 
to increase labour productivity." Chernomyrdin stressed the need 
to "get rid of incapable leaders." 
  To solve the problem of non-payments, the government has 
mapped out several measurers, including to pay off the debt for 
1993 estimated at 4.6 trillion roubles by the end of March. A 
new procedure for issuing centralised credits has been 
introduced. Under the new regulations, they will be issued to 
end users for targeted payments. There are also plans to 
introduce soon a mechanism for settling overdue credit debts 
through finance bills. Additionally, commercial bills will be 
introduced. Work is underway to prepare documents obliging tax 
payers to provide information about all of their bank accounts. 
  "The government is taking measures to begin the process of 
halting ineffective industries and will actively use bankruptcy 
proceedings," Chernomyrdin said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- The government presented the 
State Duma with a draft budget for 1994 providing for a huge 
deficit of over 60 trillion roubles. 
  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin described it as "hard but 
realistic," adding that it "sets extremely strict parameters for 
financing the most vital state needs and programmes." In his 
speech to the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's 
new Parliament, on Thursday he said the government will allocate 
not more that 183 trillion roubles for this purpose, compared to 
240 trillion roubles requested by some industrialists. 
  The draft allows for a deficit of 62.4 trillion roubles, or 
nine per cent of the gross domestic product, which is within the 
limits announced by President Boris Yeltsin in his 
state-of-the-nation address. The fulfilment of the budget will 
require additional measures to normalise the financial situation 
in the country, step up control over tax collection and seek new 
sources of budget revenues. 
  Chernomyrdin stressed that the government will no longer put 
up with violations of tax regulations and tax evasion. "We will 
consider this as crime against the state," he said. 
  "To my mind it is totally wrong to speak about the 
bankruptcy 
of the state," he emphasised. "The russian state is not 
bankrupt. It is capable of paying off its debts." However, he 
pointed out that it is necessary to "somberly realise that we 
should live according to our means and do not take unfulfillable 
obligations. Otherwise we risk to plunge ourselves into a new 
spiral of inflation and stamping out social conflicts." 
  He said he mentioned this in connection with the continuing 
wave of strikes in several Russian regions. There can no longer 
be quick and popular solutions in the economy, the premier said. 
  The situation in the country "remains extremely complex on 
the whole," the premier continued. He blamed this on the 
continuing production decline which causes stoppages in the work 
of industrial enterprises. As a result of such stoppages, 22 
million man-days were lost at 4,000 enterprises in February.

february inflation was about ten per cent. In 1993 the number 
of people living beyond the subsistence level shrank twofold. 
Presently, there are 25 million such people in Russia. However, 
the premier warned against self-appeasement, saying it would be 
"premature and inappropriate" to feel elated about the decrease 
in inflation. The main problems in the economy "are directly 
connected with non-payments which are the most vivid indicator 
of the depth and intensity of crisis processes." As of March 1,

  [Text] Moscow, 17 Mar -- In the first six months of 1994 it 
is envisaged that a form of compensation should be retained by 
increasing pensions in line with the growth in consumer prices. 
From 1 February compensation to pensioners is to be increased 
from 11,700 rubles to 20,000 rubles and from 1 May to 29,600 
rubles. This was reported today at a session of the Russian 
Federation Government Presidium by Vasiliy Barchuk, chairman of 
the board of Russia's pension fund, during an examination of the 
draft budget of the fund for the first six months of 1994. 
  He explained that the fund's draft budget presupposes that 
its income amounts to almost 17 trillion rubles, and its 
expenditure to approximately 16 trillion rubles. Of the 
budget's income, 16.1 trillion rubles derive from insurance 
contributions from employers and citizens, and 784 billion 
rubles come from the republican budget. 
  In his speech Vasiliy Barchuk drew attention to the "need to 
ensure the timely payment of state pensions, otherwise we will 
have serious social conflicts." 
  In this connection Viktor Chernomyrdin stated that "the 
government cannot allow pension payments to be overdue; we have 
to act in a precise manner here." The chairman of the 
government has warned leaders of the regions which delay 
payments to the pension fund that this practice is inadmissible. 
At the suggestion of Viktor Chernomyrdin, the draft budget of 
the Russian Federation pension fund for the first six months of 
1994 was approved as a whole by the presidium of the government.

<F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva article: "The Government Will Not Be </F>
Able to Unravel the Budget"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the Russian government discussed the 
budget for the third day running. The "budget sitting" was 
still not over by the time this article was being prepared for 
publication. The only thing that was clear was that 
ratification of the estimate of state revenue and expenditure 
was making slow headway. 
  One of the key questions is what the revenue figure will be. 
The Finance Ministry insists that a figure of 120.7 trillion 
rubles [R] is perfectly realistic. Chernomyrdin, however, is 
demanding detailed validation. The point is that numerous 
critics have repeatedly questioned the figure. 
  The sum of R120.7 trillion is 16.6 percent of GDP. Last 
year's revenue of R17.2 trillion represented only 10.6 percent 
of GDP. If you bear in mind that financial discipline has not 
become much stricter, it should be recognized that the 
difference is substantial. However, the Finance Ministry argues 
that such a straight comparison is inappropriate, as the 
procedure for calculating revenue and expenditure has been 
somewhat modified this year (in particular tied credit, 
investment-related credit, will now go through the budget -- 
which was not formerly the case). Thus, under comparable 
conditions R120.7 trillion now represents, according to the 
Finance Ministry's calculations, not 16.6 percent of GDP but 
only 11.1 percent. 
  So you can argue about the figure, but there is nevertheless 
a proposed growth in revenue in the 1994 draft budget compared 
with last year's budget. How will this be achieved? The 
Finance Ministry cites the following additional sources: 
revenue from foreign economic activity, the procedure for 
calculating which will now be changed; an increase in the 
federal tax on profits; the introduction of a federal income tax 
on the population (previously all 12 percent of it went into 
local budgets, whereas 1 percent will now be paid into the 
federal treasury); and -- the final additional source of revenue 
-- new kinds of excise duty. They will be enumerated in a 
special government decree. 
  However, it is not just revenue which generates questions. A 
serious polemic is also developing over expenditure items. 
  There is very intensive discussion under way on the 
financing 
of the military-industrial complex. After two days of 
discussion defense industry spokesmen failed to find a common 
language with the Finance Ministry. 
  No final decision has been made on investment expenditure 
either. The Finance Ministry considers that 53 trillion is the 
maximum that the budget can bear. The Economy Ministry, 
however, steadfastly insists that this is not enough to support 
production. 
  The financing of the mass media is another painful problem. 
The Finance Ministry has agreed in general terms to provide 
subsidies; however, they are far more modest than those the mass 
media were counting on. As is well known, payments for 
communications services devour the lion's share of these 
subsidies, and communications charges went up by a factor of 2.5 
in January. The communications workers put this leap down to 
the twofold increase in charges for electricity. It appears 
that the government is inclined to think that the power workers 
"have gone too far." At least the Commission for Operational 
Management, headed by First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets, insists 
that is the case. And now the issue of subsidies to the mass 
media is linked with the problems of the power workers. 
  So after two days of discussion in government a large 
question mark still hangs over the revenue and expenditure 
figures and the size of the budget deficit.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "President Has Left for </F>
Sochi `To Think About the Reforms,' Whereas in Moscow They Have 
Started Talking About Introducing a State of Economic Emergency"] 
  [Text] At Tuesday's session of the Federation Council, 
Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko caused a sensation with the 
announcement that the Russian parliament will shortly adopt a 
law on a state of emergency in the economy. However, in a 
"Vesti" television program interview the very same day the 
Federation Council chairman stated that he was merely referring 
to the need to take immediate and extremely prompt action within 
the financial and economic spheres. This alone and nothing more. 
  For the second time in a row in recent days Vladimir 
Shumeyko 
has made some stunning statements. On a visit to Kaliningrad 
last week the speaker of the upper chamber announced that the 
government is preparing a decision on a 50-percent 
across-the-board tax cut. "Nothing of the sort is planned," 
Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko stated in an 
interview with IZVESTIYA, delicately suggesting that Shumeyko's 
interpretation of the president's wish to alleviate the tax 
burden as expressed in his message to parliament seemed somewhat 
free. 
  And now society is yet again being invited to unravel the 
remarks of a politician whose public status obliges him to use 
precise and unambiguous phrases. 
  However, are we simply talking about linguistic sloppiness 
here, the kind that gives rise to free interpretations? In an 
interview with INTERFAX, Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin announced that 
the day before Vladimir Shumeyko did in fact discuss with him 
the possibility of adopting a law on a state of economic 
emergency. Moreover, Rybkin claims that Viktor Chernomyrdin also 
took part in the discussion of this matter, which took place 
late in the evening of 14 March. "The three of us discussed 
which was the best of three possible options for approving the 
second-quarter budget. How should we approve it: By a special 
law, by suspending various articles of the law in a state of 
emergency regime, or by continuing to work normally, in which 
case we would need at least two or three months to approve the 
budget." Ivan Rybkin declined to say which of the three options 
he had listed seemed to be the most expedient. 
  Meanwhile nobody has yet officially dismissed the specter of 
economic state of emergency conjured up by the remarks -- be 
they careless or cunning -- of two leading politicians. And we 
can only guess what form it will take. Perhaps, following the 
Belorussian [Belarusian] example, we will witness the 
confiscation of enterprises' foreign currency funds, resolute 
cessation of auctions at the Interbank Foreign Currency 
Exchange, the imposition of a fixed ruble exchange rate, and the 
nationalization of a significant proportion of assets belonging 
to commercial structures? It cannot be permitted for a 
government, even a government that is as closed to the press as 
the present one, to keep society in a state of ignorance 
regarding such intentions. If it harbors no such intentions, 
then it ought to announce this fact officially and extremely 
clearly. 
  But yet again we are in a complete fog. Ivan Rybkin has just 
refuted press reports of his conversation with Shumeyko and 
Chernomyrdin. "I have never had occasion to hold talks on this 
topic with anyone," the speaker stated at a plenary session of 
the Duma in reply to a deputy's question. 
  On the same day Aleksandr Livshits, leader of the group of 
economic experts affiliated to the Russian president, circulated 
a statement saying that "at the present time he sees no need for 
the highest organs of the country's state power to adopt any 
emergency measures regarding the economy." 
  ...As he left for a vacation in Sochi Boris Yeltsin 
announced 
that while he is on leave he intends to get down to formulating 
a mechanism for implementing his message to parliament. Could 
it be that the government, supported by the parliamentary 
speakers and wishing to spare the president this concern of 
state during his leave, has already set about formulating such a 
mechanism by introducing a state of economic emergency? Or will 
the explanation that once again we have misinterpreted somebody 
be forthcoming tomorrow?

Yuriy Meshkov's decision on holding a poll among the Crimean

  He emphasized that separatist circles in the Crimea will 
accuse President Kravchuk of not giving the Crimea the 
possibility to conduct reforms. Nevertheless, in the opinion of 
Mykola Mykhalchenko, in the long term, the Ukrainian president's 
decree will stabilize the political situation in both Crimea and 
Ukraine, and it serves as a serious argument in the battle with 
separatism, preventing the creation of a legal basis for 
Crimea's secession from Ukraine.

  It is a pleasant thing that the youths have gathered here 
after the completion of the severe examinations of life with the 
hope of planning for a good future. Life itself is a real 
master [words indistinct] and opens the real image of the 
politicians and those people who are fighting for positions. 
Those people who argued about democracy until recently [words 
indistinct] and considered themselves as patriots and leaders of 
the nation have exerted pressure on the legitimate government 
and committed murder, robbery, and persecution of the 
representatives of certain rayons and regions of Tajikistan. 
Instead of honest labor during the sowing season they 
[politicians] involved the people in long-term rallies, they did 
not spare the lives of youths who were deluded, they began the 
distribution of positions and properties, and violated the law 
and political behavior. They insulted, murdered, and robbed 
representatives of other nationalities who had worked and lived 
with us Tajiks for a long time. Reminding you of this, I want 
to warn the youths. Youth has to learn from past mistakes. 
  They have to be united in the future and should follow the 
[way of] unity and solidarity because the youths are the future 
political figures, leaders of parties and movements, ministries 
and departments, and so on. Now that we are pursuing the road 
to a democratic society, we have to get used to tolerating 
multiparty and political pluralism and recognize it. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent] Following the afternoon break, the congress 
continued its work and its participants discussed a number of 
issues that are included on the congress agenda. The first 
congress of the Union of Youths of Tajikistan will continue its 
work tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kuleshov: "President S. Niyazov Ready </F>
To Replace His Government Unless the Consumer Market Is Put in 
Order"] 
  [Text] Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] -- It is a long time since 
viewers tuning into the Turkmenistan news have seen the kind of 
dressing down given by President S. Niyazov to ministry and 
department leaders over the abominable state of the consumer 
market. Calling his adjutants [zampred] to attention, the 
Turkmenbashi told them: "All of our slogans and promises are 
worth nothing if store shelves remain empty. People are 
becoming exasperated -- and rightly so. How much longer are you 
going to trade commodities from state resources at market 
prices?!" 
  Store shelves that have been stripped bare and on which you 
will not even find toothpaste, shoe polish, matches, or soap; 
soaring prices at state trade outlets -- not to mention 
commercial kiosks and markets -- even by comparison with those 
in Russia; the despondent faces of people gloomily wandering 
around the stores with the now-worthless manat -- this, 
IZVESTIYA wrote 18 February -- this is the situation in 
Turkmenistan's cities, even in the capital. Nor has it changed 
one iota today. The lack of the essential range of commodities 
conntinues, with the very same wildly inflated prices at state 
retail outlets. 
  How can you live if you earn 200-250 manats while a kg of 
meat at the market costs between 35 and 40 manats, a kg of 
potatoes is 10 manats, and a pack of cigarettes anything from 20 
to 30 manats? Who controls all of this here in the Republic? 
Indeed, is it under control? In the final analysis, who 
regulates prices? These questions were quite rightly asked at 
the Cabinet of Ministers session. 
  Prices are one thing, but the absence of commodities in the 
stores, even those which are produced in Turkmenistan, is 
another problem dogging the consumer market. "Why is it that, 
despite the availability of raw materials and labor, production 
of these goods is not increasing?" S. Niyazov exclaimed 
indignantly, turning to his adjutants. "Who sanctions market 
prices for state resources?" 
  By the way, he put these questions to them some five months 
ago, when the manat was being introduced and when, taking 
advantage of the Turkmenbashi's absence from Turkmenistan, 
departments pushed up prices for goods and foodstuffs so that 
people ended up wandering around the stores as if they were in a 
museum. In those early October days a major dressing down was 
also delivered, but everything was quickly forgotten, and that 
is why today, when returning home from a trip to Moscow, people 
from Turkmenistan cram all their free luggage space with 
sausage, cheese, fresh eggs, jam, confectionery, and fruit in 
the Russian capital, because they will not find any such thing 
at state trade outlets in Turkmenistan. Those who cannot fly to 
Moscow do "the next best thing": On weekends, thousands of 
people from Krasnovodsk, Tashauz, and Mary come to Ashkhabad on 
the local trains and clear out the already impoverished stores, 
despite the exorbitant prices. 
  Giving his adjutants a 10-day breathing space before what is 
left of confidence in the government runs out, the Turkmenistan 
president demanded from it concrete, vigorous action to improve 
the consumer market situation and the supply to the population 
first and foremost of foodstuffs, medicines, and vital 
commodities.

  [Text] The president of Uzbekistan has issued a decree on 
the priorities for deregulation and privatization. Among the 
priorities are broad involvement of the population in the 
process of reforms by means of developing the securities market, 
creating public joint-stock companies with a reduction in the 
proportion of shares belonging to the state, and forming markets 
for real estate and means of production. 
  Another priority is the demonopolization of production and 
control structures and the attraction of foreign investments by 
holding tenders, auctions, investment auctions, and direct sale 
of property. The decree stresses the need for state support for 
privatized enterprises. 
  For public joint-stock companies in which the state retains 
its share, it is envisioned to have blocs of shares belonging to 
the state, to the work force, to foreign partners, and free 
selling on stock exchanges and securities markets, including 
those abroad.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev article: "The Pentagon Chief Is Coming to </F>
Moscow To Arrange Relations and Also To Show Himself as a 
Politician"] 
  [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry is setting out 
on a week-long visit to Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine. 
  This is one of the first trips abroad by the Pentagon chief. 
At the end of last year, when Perry was offered the post of 
secretary of defense to replace Les Aspin, who had resigned, 
evil tongues maintained that the candidate was good in every 
respect -- an experienced leader, an expert in high 
technologies, and a successful entrepreneur -- but not a 
politician. In Kiev, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Minsk, and, 
particularly, Moscow, Perry will have to demonstrate his 
qualities as a political leader. 
  The Pentagon chief is coming to Moscow literally a couple of 
days after the Vladivostok meeting between U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev -- which gives grounds for assuming that they are 
connected not only in time but in aims. In addition to tackling 
questions of bilateral cooperation between the United States and 
Russia in the military sphere, Perry must demonstrate that 
Washington's policy in support of democratic transformations in 
Russia has not changed, despite the friction which has arisen 
recently, and that the partnership will be continued. 
  On the eve of his trip the secretary spoke at the George 
Washington University. He emphasized that "all the major 
powers, including those friendly to the United States, have 
their own interests, which sometimes run counter to 
Washington's. We cannot expect Russia or any other great power 
to act against its own national interests." At the same time in 
relations between states there must not be even a hint of 
jealousy of others' successes. The defense secretary once again 
made a high assessment of Russia's contribution to settling the 
crisis in the Balkans and, in particular, to removing the Serb 
artillery from positions around Sarajevo. 
  Speaking of the main aims of U.S. policy toward Russia, 
Perry 
outlined to some extent the range of problems which he intends 
to touch on in Moscow -- guarantees of security and of the 
prevention of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the 
maintenance of regional stability in the region, including the 
states of the former Warsaw Pact. 
  Special attention will evidently be devoted to Russia's 
attitude to the NATO "Partnership [sotrudnichestvo] for Peace" 
program, which Moscow is in no hurry to subscribe to, although 
it has declared its readiness. As has been learned from 
informed sources, the problem of recycling radioactive elements 
will be discussed in the talks -- a problem which, in the 
Russian leadership's opinion, can be resolved only with all 
possible international assistance. 
  Moscow's offer of broader cooperation might meet with 
understanding on the part of the U.S. secretary, who believes 
that closer relations with Moscow not only help to advance 
democracy in Russia but also contribute to better understanding 
of what is happening there, on those immense expanses. 
  IZVESTIYA was told at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow that the 
program has not yet been finalized, and it is too soon to say 
anything specific about the visit.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "Both Partners and Competitors"] </F>
  [Text] In the new world, under radically changed 
conditions, Russia and America might be not only partners but 
also competitors, and each country might have its own strategic 
aims in international policy which do not coincide with the 
other side's interests. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry 
made such an admission on the eve of his visit to Moscow. 
  The Pentagon head declared that there should be active 
cooperation with Russia in those cases where the two countries' 
interests coincide and that mutual attempts to act independently 
should be perceived calmly when such interests do not coincide. 
Americans should also be prepared, however, for the fact that 
the strategic aims of Russia and the United States might also 
contradict each other. 
  Precisely in order to prevent such a turn, the United States 
must give all possible support to Russia's democratic processes 
and peace-loving steps, the defense secretary emphasized. Among 
the main areas of cooperation in the military and 
military-political sphere between the two countries he 
particularly singled out cooperation in destroying chemical 
arsenals and part of the nuclear arsenals, in combating the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and in converting 
defense production. The Pentagon chief named as examples of 
direct cooperation along military lines the exercise planned for 
this summer by Russian and U.S. peacemaking contingents -- the 
27th Motorized Rifle Division and the 3d Mechanized Division 
respectively.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 17 TASS -- Head of the Presidential 
Staff Sergey Filatov called to refrain from whipping up tensions 
in connection with the toppling of the mayor of Vladivostok in 
the Far East and compared him to anti-Yeltsin rebels who had 
barricaded themselves in the parliament building in Moscow last 
October after the president had dissolved the former legislature. 
  Filatov told TASS on Thursday that the decision to dismiss 
Viktor Cherepkov was adopted after the local prosecutor's office 
initiated criminal proceedings against him on charges of 
corruption. However, the mayor refused to show up for 
interrogations and preferred to barricade himself in his office 
and "attracted armed people to his side", he said. 
  "It looks as if the example of rebels from the `White House' 
in Moscow, who provoked bloodshed in the capital last October, 
was borrowed by Cherepkov and his supporters", Filatov said, 
adding that the sacked mayor tried to "win political dividends" 
from the criminal case. 
  Filatov quoted law enforcement agencies in Vladivostok as 
saying that Cherepkov is accused of taking huge bribes. 
Prosecutors in Vladivostok said he could not remain the mayor 
as the position allowed him to exert pressure on subordinates 
forcing them to destroy discrediting documents. 
  Filatov also quoted Interior Minister Viktor Yerin as 
telling 
him that "an operation to unblock the mayor's office and avert 
disorders" had been carried out in Vladivostok. 
  Cherepkov left the office by 11.00 hours GMT (21.00 local 
time) and Filatov said public order in the city was being 
restored. 
  Konstantin Tolstosheyn was appointed acting mayor.

  [Text] The State Duma is holding hearings into the 
Partnership for Peace program today. 
  [Correspondent Dmitriy Vinsker] Representatives of the 
foreign and defense ministries who spoke at the hearings 
insisted on the need for Russia to join in this program. In 
their opinion, Russia outside the Partnership for Peace program 
will be on the path of self-isolation, but if Russia joins it 
can develop the program in ways which are necessary for Moscow. 
  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma's International 
Committee, spoke against joining. According to him the idea of 
the program is good but, in his words, the devil is hidden in 
the details, and these details, as Lukin stressed, incidentally 
just like the positive and negative sides of the program, are 
insufficiently thought through. It is worth noting that 
Vladimir Lukin's stance is shared, to a lesser or greater 
degree, by virtually all the deputies of the lower chamber.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Morozov] </F>
  [Text] Bucharest, 17 Mar -- An agreement on cooperation 
between the defense ministries of Romania and Ukraine was signed 
today in Bucharest by Gheorghe Tinca and Vitaliy Radetskyy, the 
heads of the military departments of the two countries. [passage 
omitted] 
  During the talks, issues of regional safety were discussed 
in 
depth, Ukrainian Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy 
said in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. We believe 
that the proposal in the sphere of ensuring regional safety, 
which President Leonid Kravchuk made in Budapest last year, and 
the "Partnership for Peace" program are interconnected. The 
adoption of the Ukrainian proposal may become the first step in 
tackling the problems of the "Partnership for Peace". 
  We regard talk about isolating Russia from these processes 
as 
unrealistic, the head of the Ukrainian military department 
stressed. Russia is a great neighboring state, and a common 
historical past unites Ukraine and Russia. We treat Russia with 
great respect and are ready for bilateral cooperation with it. 
  As to the prospects of joining NATO, in accordance with the 
decision of the parliament, as is known, Ukraine is not a member 
of any bloc. Military-political and military-technical issues 
connected with it are being worked on at the moment, and the 
Defense Ministry proposals will be submitted to the new 
parliament that has the prerogative to make a corresponding 
decision. 
  The territorial issues of North Bukovina, the south of 
Bessarabia, and Zmeinyy Ostrov were not raised at the talks in 
Bucharest, V.Radetskiy noted. We recognize Romania's 
territorial integrity, and Romania fully recognizes the 
territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Romanian side stressed 
that some would have liked to raise this issue for the purpose 
of causing the two neighboring countries to quarrel or of 
creating tension between them. However, we must proceed from 
the official stand of the heads of state. That is why Ukraine 
and Romania do not lay any claims on each other.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lashch report: "Rumors About Attempt on </F>
President's Life. There Has Been No Attempt"] 
  [Text] Yesterday rumors spread in Moscow about an attempt 
on President Boris Yeltsin's life. KOMMERSANT-DAILY's 
correspondent turned to the Russian Main Security Administration 
[MSA] for comment. According to MSA information, what gave rise 
to the rumor was the following event. 
  Andrey Oligov, press secretary of the president's Main 
Security Administration, said that on 15 March security officers 
at the president's summer house detained a 45-year-old local 
resident who tried to sneak into the compound. The intruder 
said that he entered the guarded territory because he was 
looking for his missing son, a serviceman. This information was 
checked and proved to be correct; afterward the detainee was 
released. 
  According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY information, yesterday at 1530 
Aleksandr Korzhakov, chief of the presidential security service, 
called the Kremlin from Sochi to say that no other incidents 
have occurred on the territory of the presidential residence in 
Sochi. 
  The president continues his vacation in Sochi; his health is 
normal.

killed and 56 others were wounded Saturday in an explosion in a 
metro station in the Azerbaijani capital Baku, the Azeri news 
agency Assa Irada said. The agency said the blast was a 
"terrorist" action, although no further details were immediately 
available. 
  For more than five years Azerbaijan has been fighting a 
bloody war with Armenian separatists over the disputed enclave 
of Nagorno-Karabakh in south western Azerbaijan.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel in Russian at 1800 GMT on 19 March, during its regular 
"Novosti" newscast, carries a 2-minute report over video by 
correspondent Mais Mamedov on the Baku metro blast. 
  Mamedov begins the report from Baku, over video of people 
entering a metro station, by saying that the capital was 
particularly busy today because people were preparing for 
tomorrow's Muslim festival. At 1355 hours local time, as a 
train drew into the 20 January station, there was a powerful 
explosion in the front carriage. Following clips of the mangled 
wreckage, pools of blood, and rescue workers on the station 
platform, Mamedov interviews Baku City Procurator Adil Agayev, 
identified by caption, next to the wrecked train. Agayev says a 
powerful explosive device was planted in the train and adds: 
"And all these deeds that have taken place recently in the city 
of Baku demonstrate that a group of saboteurs is permanently 
operating in Baku. According to preliminary information, 
according to the testimony of witnesses, it is evident that 
there was a suspicious individual in the carriage where the 
explosion occurred today. We have been given a description of 
him and an identikit picture is being built up of him to 
establish his identity in the city." 
  In the studio, the announcer adds that according to the 
latest preliminary figures, 12 people died and 53 were injured 
in the blast.

  [Text] Moscow, March 19 (AFP) -- At least 12 people were 
killed and 61 others injured, eight seriously, in an explosion 
Saturday in a crowded subway station in Baku, Azerbaijani 
authorities reported. 
  Fuad Akhundov, a presidential spokesman contacted by AFP, 
said that the explosion was caused by a delayed-action bomb. 
  The blast ripped through two coaches of a train in the 
January 20 subway station, the Azerbaijani news agency 
ASSA-IRADA said. First the head wagon, then the second 
exploded, both being engulfed by fire, it said. 
  "According to all probabilities, it was the Armenians," 
Akhundov said. 
  Azerbaijani troops have been fighting a six-year war against 
Armenian separatists from Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory 
populated mostly by Armenians but controlled by Baku. 
  More than 20,000 people have been killed in the fighting 
since 1988 and the Armenians were widely seen in Baku as likely 
perpetrators of any bombing. 
  However, no explosive device had been discovered by Saturday 
evening to back the bomb thesis. 
  A local journalist reached by phone said that about 100 
wounded people were evacuated from the station which was closed 
by police shortly after the blast. 
  Tensions have been running high in Baku, the Azerbaijani 
capital, in recent weeks after security forces began a crackdown 
against opposition forces supporting exiled former president 
Abulfaz Elchibey. 
  Several members of the Popular Front headed by Elchibey have 
been arrested and police have staged raids on the headquarters 
of the opposition party. 
  After the blast Saturday, Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev 
called an emergency meeting of internal security officials, but 
the outcome of the meeting was not immediately known. 
  The explosion occurred around 1:00 p.m. (0800 GMT) in the 
subway station located in the northern district of the city and 
named "January 20" after the 1990 crackdown in Azerbaijan by 
Soviet troops. 
  At least 170 people died in the crackdown ordered by Moscow 
to quash weeks of violence between Armenians and Azeris in the 
northern suburb of Sumgait. 
  A diplomat in Baku said the number of casualties was 
probably 
increased by the fact that people were out in force to go 
shopping ahead of the new year celebrations Monday (as 
calculated by the old, pre-Islamic calendar). 
  Another explosion took place a month ago on a train coming 
into Azerbaijan from Russia, without causing any casualties. 
Responsibility for the explosion was not established.

  [Text] Baku, 18 Mar -- After the short period of calm that

operations. According to the reports from Azerbaijan's Ministry

after the shelling of Azerbaijan Army positions in the direction 
of Agdam from a "Grad" missile installation, which did not stop 
for 24 hours.

<F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Azerbaijan: Split in Ruling </F>
Party"] 
  [Text] Baku -- It is not a simple case: A split seems to 
be coming to a head within the leadership of the New Azerbaijan 
Party led by Heydar Aliyev. Opposition newspapers, in 
particular MUKHALIFAT [name as transliterated], present what is 
happening as a sensation and maliciously hint that the 
president's political party is not destined to be long-lived. 
  However, it is not a question of major political or 
ideological differences. It is just that party functionaries in 
the upper echelons have let themselves become embroiled in the 
fighting that usually flares up when people display 
irrepressible appetites. They are squabbling not in their 
offices but in two popular newspapers, NEW AZERBAIJAN and SES 
[name as transliterated]. The former has ambition, the latter 
has accusations to make. 
  Deputy General Secretary Ali Nagiyev, who, informed sources 
report, is the president's agent, has come under fire. He is 
being charged with various crimes, which, observers believe, is 
not that important compared with the fact that the republic's 
largest political organization has unexpectedly started making a 
show of its "internal feuding." 
  That will hardly affect the rating of the president-general 
secretary. It was, after all, Heydar Aliyev's prestige and his 
wealth of political experience that helped to boost the image of 
the party itself. Admittedly it has not so far held a 
constituent congress, although, according to some reports, it 
has put together a fairly ramified mobile network of primary 
organizations. It has none of the "dead souls" in its ranks 
that are so widespread in the republic's other political 
organizations. 
  It is deemed a matter of prestige to be a member of the 
ruling New Azerbaijan Party -- its representatives are gradually 
replacing former People's Front functionaries in leadership 
posts. There is every indication that those who have ended up 
unwanted are rebelling, trying to remove or compromise the 
general secretary's most intractable associates. Amid this 
hubbub a trend inherent in virtually all Azerbaijan's political 
organizations is clearly appearing: Following the formation of 
a new party the fight for power is stepped up followed by a 
fight for prestigious posts. 
  By and large a trite situation that has little to do with 
state organizational development or ideological support for the 
democratic transformations in society being carried out under 
the "president's program." In a word, what has happened had to 
happen: The new party has been organizationally constituted, 
without however being able, contrary to expectations, to take 
the lead in society. That is one of the reasons for the 
imminent split, not proximity to and influence on the party's 
leader. 
  When assessing what is happening observers discern the 
following important factor: The feuding is coming from outside, 
with the intention of weakening the ranks of Geydar Aliyev's 
supporters and making the party he leads a laughing stock. That 
is just how the "newspaper barrage" appears, disappointing the 
long expectations and belief that the avowed ideals are of real 
interest to Azerbaijanis. 
  The party elders are making the most sensible suggestions: 
They have asked the general secretary to put an end to the 
growing strife and denunciations. However, things are being 
aggravated by the fact that the political commission has not met 
for a long time and there is no glasnost and collegiality in the 
executive structure's decisionmaking. Moreover, leaders who 
come after the general secretary in the hierarchy are sometimes 
unable to control their own actions and emotions, causing mass 
discontent among rank-and-file party members.

by Turkey in Transcaucasia, must be considered as directed 
against Russia. The aggression of Azerbaijan against Karabakh 
wouldn't be possible if Turkey didn't support Azerbaijan." 
According to him there are a few people in the State Duma that 
agree with national-republicans in the question concerning to 
Armenia and Karabakh. Today the delegation of 
National-republican party leave for Moscow.

  [Text] Armenia wishes the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to be 
settled through negotiations involving not only Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh and Russia but also European 
nations and the United States, an Armenian statesman said. 
  But such talks must be preceded by an unconditional 
ceasefire, Ara Saakian, first deputy chairman of the Armenian 
parliament, told INTERFAX on Sunday. 
  Today both Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan are making 
preliminary conditions, the former pressing for a ceasefire and 
a certain legal status for itself, the latter demanding that 
Nagorno-Karabakh withdraw its troops from Azerbaijani 
territories they occupy, Saakian said. 
  He said Armenia "is building great hopes" on Russia's 
mediation. 
  Meanwhile, disagreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan last 
week prevented the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly meeting in 
St. Petersburg from passing an appeal against the imposition of 
a transport or energy blockade by one Commonwealth state against 
another. Azerbaijani delegation leader Afiyaddin Dzhalilov 
insisted that the appeal include a provision for a mechanism for 
liberating the 20 percent of Azerbaijani lands occupied by 
Nagorno-Karabakh forces and for bringing back home the more than 
a million Azerbaijani refugees.

publications that libel the Motherland." 
  The authors of the letters called on the president to put an 
end to the activities of those who smuggled "slanderous pieces" 
into the Republic and "could not reconcile to Uzbekistan's 
future as a great state."

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry is being 
received in Almaty today following his visit to Moscow. 
  [Correspondent Dukesh Baimbetov] Today, after a meeting at 
the Republic's Ministry of Defense, the U.S. military delegation 
headed by William Perry was received by Kazakhstan President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev. As is known, during the recent visit of 
Kazakhstan's leader to the United States the sides signed a 
number of documents between the two countries on economic, 
political, and military issues. 
  President Clinton and Vice President Gore have charged me 
with paying particular attention to the practical implementation 
of these programs, Perry said. Today, in particular, issues 
were discussed regarding the United States in the conversion of 
defense industry enterprises in Kazakhstan, inspecting the 
territory of the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground, and the 
allocation of aid to its population. Incidentally, the first 
aid has already arrived. The Americans brought with them very 
valuable diagnostic equipment and medicines. They also spoke 
about tripartite space cooperation between Kazakhstan, the 
United States, and Russia. 
  [Begin Nazarbayev recording] There is nothing to delay on 
the 
part of the Kazakh side. At the present time, we are holding 
talks with Russia. We hope that we will sign these agreements, 
in which all the issues will be agreed upon, this month. 
  We have reached agreement both with the United States and 
with Russia that Kazakhstan will be compensated for the cost of 
the highly enriched uranium that is in the warheads. [end

  [Text] Almaty 19 March, TASS -- U.S. Secretary of Defence 
William Perry, who is currently in Kazakhstan on a working 
visit, was received in the republican Ministry of Defence on 
Saturday. Mr. Perry also attended a session of the joint 
Kazakhstan-American committee on defence industry conversion to 
civilian production. 
  The meetings, and the talks with President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev several hours earlier, resulted in the signing of an 
agreement on the conversion of the Kazakhstan defence industry 
to civilian production. 
  The agreement is actually a supplement to the earlier 
reached 
accord on the dismantling of the SS-18 missile silos and ensures 
an influx of an aggregate of 70 million U.S. dollars to the 
republic for defence industry conversion needs. 
  These documents are intended to ensure the dismantling of 
combat nuclear missile systems based in Kazakhstan and convert 
them to suit civilian and peaceful purposes, and additional 
training of the military personnel subject to demobilisation. 
  U.S. businesses are to be invited to help the defence 
industry conversion effort. In particular, a number of American 
companies will be involved in the reconstruction of appropriate 
enterprises for them to change over to the manufacture of 
consumer goods. 
  Mr. Perry and his party are to leave for Baykonur cosmodrome 
on 20 March.

  [Text] Almaty, 20 March (TASS) -- On completing the 
official part of his Kazakh visit, U.S. Defence Secretary 
Willian Perry departed for the Baykonur cosmodrome from the 
Kazakh capital. 
  The secretary's visit to the cosmodrome is of a sight-seeing 
nature. However, the aims pursued by this trip are 
self-evident. The U.S. side is interested in studying Baykonur's 
possibilities with a view to U.S. participation in the use of 
its unique potential. 
  In the opinion of several local analysts, Kazakhstan tries 
to 
bring pressure on Russia by organising the U.S. defence 
secretary's visit to Baykonur. Several rounds of the 
Kazakh-Russian talks held in the recent past brought closer the 
positions of the sides. 
  However, they could not agree, for the time being, on the 
period of a lease and the amount of a lease payment. 
  Almaty believes that if the United States displays readiness 
for cooperation with the Republic in the use of the cosmodrome, 
it will be possible to cut short the duration of its leasing to 
Russia and, consequently, to start earlier the establishment of 
an international space company or any other form of its 
utilisation on a multilateral basis. 
  Following the visit to Baykonur, Perry and his party will go 
to Kiev.

Committee has named 50 enterprises that will be offered for sale 
in the first ever specialized coupon auction. The list of 
enterprises was published in the republican newspapers YEGEMEN 
KAZAKHSTAN [SOVEREIGN] and KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA. These facts 
were given at a news conference held by Zhanibek Karibzhanov, 
chairman of the State Property Committee. 
  He stressed that a new, very important stage of 
implementation of the massive scale privatization program is 
beginning for investment funds and for floated enterprises, 
which will be sold at these coupon auctions. Practically all 
inhabitants of the Republic -- 96.5 percent -- have already 
received their privatization check books. A new deadline was 
set and check books will continue to be handed out until 1 April. 
  The first auction will be held on 29 April with the 
participation of 109 investment funds with licences from the 
State Property Committee. Their applications for participation 
will be taken on 28 April from 1500 until 1800 local time. The 
starting price for a share of each of the 50 enterprises will be 
announced by the state committee no later than 5 April. Among 
objects to be put to tender: Profitable light industry 
enterprises, large construction industry, and processing 
industry from the various regions of the Republic will be sold. 
  Similar coupon auctions, starting from May, will be held 
every two weeks. Until the end of the year, at 17 auctions, 
shares of 1,200 enterprises are planned to be sold for 
privatization investment coupons, and shares of 2,500 
enterprises -- by the end of 1995.

  [Text] The head of Kyrgyzstan's parliament said the outflow 
of Russian speakers from the Central Asian republic was 
seriously harming its culture, education and economy. 
  Medetkan Sherimkulov told INTERFAX on Saturday that 100,000 
Russian-speakers had already left Kyrgyzstan, which has a 
Russian-speaking community of about 1 million, or 20 percent of 
the total population. He said more Russian speakers were 
leaving than were coming in, the gap permanently increasing. As 
a result, the republic is losing much of its engineering and 
research personnel, many teachers and high-skilled workers, he 
said. 
  Sherimkulov believes that what forces so many Russian 
speakers to go away is fear of possible future instability and 
the low wages, which on average are less than half those in 
Russia.

successful implementation of the spring sowing. 
  Similarly, issues relating to the repatriation of refugees, 
creation of new working seats, provision of food for the 
population, and other vital problems were examined during the 
course of the meeting. 
  Rakhmonov said that the working commission has completed the 
work on the draft of the new Tajik constitution and asks the 
participants of the seminar-conference to express their opinion 
on ways of adopting the new constitution, holding the referendum 
on determining the form of state administration, and election of 
the new parliament. 
  The head of state answered numerous questions from the 
chairmen of town and rayon executive committees.

  [Text] Members of the Constitutional Committee and the 
working group for the completion of the fundamental law, E. 
Hlushkevych, H. Vasilevych, M. Chudakov, and V. Fadeyev held a 
news conference on 17 March and commented on the principal 
articles of the Constitution. 
  In the beginning they spoke about the "distinctions" and 
advantages of the Belarusian Constitution. However then, driven 
into a corner by reporters, the lawmakers had to admit that the 
Constitution contains a number of inconsistent and ambivalent 
provisions. For example, the vertical structure of presidential 
power has been outlined very vaguely. With regard to this, the 
authors of the constitution said that the article on 
presidential power will be accompanied by a law that is "much 
easier to adopt." 
  The issue of merging Belarusian and Russian monetary systems 
was also raised. According to the new Constitution, the 
Republic of Belarus shall pursue a single financial-credit 
policy, which in a way contradicts the unification. However, 
Yuriy Fadeyev clarified this issue by saying that a single 
monetary system does not necessarily denote an independent 
monetary system, adding that "there will be a single system in 
Grodno, Minsk, Vitebsk, and Brest." Thus, everything seems to 
be working just fine. However, confused by the questions that 
followed, the working group member added: "One can predict that 
the ruble zone will not be formed at all." 
  In the course of the news conference, it turned out that a 
number of relevant provisions were excluded from the 
Constitution. The legislative committee and working group 
members explained this by saying that those issues could hamper 
the adoption of the entire Constitution. Thus, one gets the 
impression that the Supreme Soviet aimed for a hasty adoption of 
the Constitution rather than its quality.

<F P=106> [Report by Valentin Zhdanko from Minsk under the "Neighbors" </F>
rubric: "Vyacheslav Kebich Does Not Abandon His Dream About 
Single Ruble Zone. Belarusian Prime Minister Bets on Russian 
Parliament"] 
  [Text] Addressing the closed meeting of the Belarusian 
parliament yesterday, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich explained 
the situation with regard to the unification of Belarus' and 
Russia's monetary systems. In his view, talks between the two 
countries' expert groups have reached a stalemate after "Mr. 
Tulin, deputy Central Bank chairman, Mr. Kazmin, deputy finance 
minister, and some others revised the documents, a procedure 
that has entirely distorted the original draft treaty that was 
to be signed." 
  The issue is, first of all, what the Minsk Government sees 
as 
unacceptable demands that the two countries' budgets be merged 
and that the Belarusian National Bank [BNB] be stripped of its 
independence. In Mr. Kebich's view, these demands have emerged 
under pressure from certain deputy factions both at the State 
Duma and the Federation Council. 
  The general tone of Mr. Kebich's address was nonetheless 
optimistic. Citing a telephone conversation with his Russian 
colleague, Viktor Chernomyrdin, he said that "the Russian 
leaders have expressed their political will and unequivocal 
desire to sign the document, which discusses setting up a money 
union, as early as this month." Mr. Kebich said that "according 
to preliminary forecasts, most political factions and committees 
at the Russian State Duma support the idea of creating an 
economic and monetary union of the two Slavic states." 
  On Friday, the Belarusian prime minister had a telephone 
conversation with Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Council's Financial Committee. According to Mr. 
Kebich, it was said during the conversation that "regarding the 
terms set by State Duma and Federation Council factions, all 
political demands have been withdrawn and will no longer be 
made." All who did make such political demands, the Belarusian 
prime minister said, were trying to thwart the signing of the 
agreement. 
  On Monday, Nikolay Gonchar is expected to arrive in Minsk 
"to 
agree on all final stances." Any unification of the two 
countries' budgets or infringement on the BNB's rights will not 
be even mentioned in the talks. 
  Inspired by the prospects, the Supreme Soviet has suspended 
the discussion on Belarus' monetary policy. A paragraph of the 
draft decree on the subject was planned to set forth that "the 
sole legal tender in the territory of the Republic" will be the 
BNB's banknote -- the ill-famed "hare" -- which is currently 
traded at around 0.15 Russian ruble. Pending news from Moscow, 
the Supreme Soviet has once again adjourned the session until 29 
March.

<F P=106> [Cristian Nita report from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] Today, the president of the Republic of Moldova, 
Mr. Mircea Snegur, received Vladlen Vasev, President Boris 
Yeltsin's special envoy regarding eliminating dissensions in the 
eastern sections of the Republic of Moldova. 
  As MOLDOVA PRES reports, Mr. Vasev reaffirmed President 
Yeltsin's position, who, as mediator, pronounces himself for the 
territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova and for solving 
differences solely by political means. 
  In turn, President Snegur assessed that the parliamentary 
elections and the sociological opinion poll `Consulting the 
People,' within the framework of which the majority of the 
population voted for the independence of the Republic of 
Moldova, constitute two essential preconditions for the recovery 
of the situation in the east of the Republic by granting that 
area a legal status implying a high degree of local 
administration. 
  In this context, it was stressed that laws in the Republic 
of 
Moldova are in keeping with the norms of a genuine democracy, 
which envisage, first and foremost, the observance of human 
rights, regardless of nationality. 
  During the dialogue, which was of a constructive nature, the 
two sides also noted that relations between the Republic of 
Moldova and Russia are developing fruitfully on the basis of 
good understanding, MOLDOVA PRES reports. 
  The group of experts on behalf of the Republic of Moldova, 
who participated in the preparation of the documents for the 
meeting of the CIS state leaders, which is scheduled to be held 
on 18 April, will conclude its activity today. 
  In an interview granted to the Moscow-based correspondent of 
Chisinau radio, Mr. Iacob Mogoreanu, permanent representative of 
the Republic of Moldova to the statutory bodies of the 
community, emphasized that the accord on free trade in the CIS 
economic area and the one on encouraging multinational 
production corporations, associations, joint ventures, and 
financial-credit organizations and institutions have been 
prepared for signing. The CIS experts have also concluded the 
initial stage of drafting a repayment system between the 
economic units in CIS member countries. 
  Mr. Mogoreanu also specified that the proceedings on setting 
up an interstate economic committee have begun; this is a body 
that coordinates the economic activity, he said, without which 
it is impossible for a community to exist.

  [Text] The Russian president's official representative, 
Ambassador Vladlen Vasev, has confirmed Moscow's position of 
standing for "the territorial integrity of Moldova and the 
overcoming of all discord by political means." 
  The Moldovan president's press service announced that 
Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and Russian Ambassador Vasev 
had met on Friday. They agreed that settlement of the 
Transdniestrian issue would contribute to restoration of 
stability in the region, which conformed with the interests of 
the population. 
  Moldovan President Snegur stressed that the democratic 
parliamentary elections and the sociological poll, during which 
most of the population had spoken for independence of Moldova, 
were the basis for normalization of the situation in Moldova's 
eastern regions. Namely, Snegur favored granting a special 
legal status with a high level of autonomy to this region.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fyodor Angeli] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 21 March, TASS -- Russian 
presidential envoy Vladilen Vasev is now in Moldova, where he 
has held talks with Moldovan President Mirca Snegur, Parliament 
Speaker Petru Lucinskiy and leader of the self-proclaimed 
Dniester Republic Igor Smirnov. The Russian diplomat explained 
to his colleagues the Russian leadership's proposals for a 
diplomatic solution to the civil conflict in Moldova. 
  The exact content of the documents given to the 
representatives of the two sides has not been revealed. 
However, ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources that the 
Russian proposals are very similar in content to the report made 
by the CSCE mission in Moldova, which was published in February 
of this year. 
  The CSCE mission sees the restoration of Moldova's 
territorial integrity as the main goal of its activity in that 
area. The left-bank regions of the Dniester River are 
impossible to rule under a central government, the CSCE report 
declares. But at the same time, the break-away republic has no 
chance of getting international recognition, nor should it hope 
for the "confederation" or "federation" of Moldova, as the rebel 
leaders in Tiraspol have proposed. 
  The CSCE mission proposes to give the Dniester region a 
special political status, with its own executive power, an 
elected assembly, and court. This status would have to be 
agreed on by both sides, and would be established by Moldovan 
legislation. The special region would be an inseparable part of 
Moldova, but would have a significant amount of home-rule. 
  The CSCE document emphasizes the vital importance of a 
single 
economic, social, and legal system. Three categories of 
jurisdiction are mentioned: 
  The centre's exclusive jurisdiction would include 
citizenship, foreign policy, defence, security forces, monetary 
policy, and state symbols. 
  The region's exclusive jurisdiction would include 
administrative structures, regional bodies, a regional 
constitution, a regional budget, and regional symbols (to be 
used alongside the state ones). 
  Joint jurisdiction would include the state language and 
official regional languages, a common tax system with a regional 
branch, the police, and the court system. 
  Perhaps the most important part of the CSCE document is the 
statement that, if Moldova rejected its status as an independent 
state and decided to join with another state (meaning Rumania), 
the special Dniester region would be guaranteed the right to 
determine its own external status.

  [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS 17/3/1994 -- From our 
correspondent: The government of the self-proclaimed Gagauz 
Republic has dismissed the head of economy, finance and state 
inspection direction "for serious financial violations." 
Reliable sources told BASAPRESS that 160 million rubles were 
embezzled from the credits granted by the "Gagauzcombanc" to the 
economic entities and was later illegally invested in 
transactions. The budget of Gagauz Republic for 1994 was a 
problem of major dispute, because the localities densely 
inhabited by Gagauzians do not want to take part in its 
formation. The Gagauz government decided that the economic 
entities in this region should make allocations to the budget 
"within the necessary limits." Local observers say that the 
Republic became almost insolvent; it does not have budget 
sources.

  [Text] The POSTFAKTUM agency reports that rumors are being 
circulated in Moscow that on 20 March Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin urgently flew to Sochi to meet the president, that 
telephones in the House of the Russian Federation Government on 
Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya are receiving only incoming 
calls and it is impossible to phone from the White House, and 
that special purpose units were put on red alert and can enter 
Moscow any minute. The source was connecting the emergence of 
these rumors with the alleged aggravation of Boris Yeltsin's 
health. However, in Viktor Chernomyrdin's reception office and 
the Russian Federation Government press service, this 
information was categorically refuted. 
  Answering a question by the POSTFAKTUM agency correspondent 
as to whether special purpose units have been put on red alert, 
a duty officer at the interior troops headquarters said that 
nothing of the kind had happened and nothing of the kind is 
expected.

  [Text] Immediately after meeting the Japanese minister 
early this morning, Viktor Chernomyrdin left for Sochi where 
Boris Yeltsin is on vacation. The unexpected movements of such 
high-ranking personalities give rise to the usual flurry of 
speculation and conjecture of all kinds, especially as there 
have been rumors recently that the president's health has 
deteriorated seriously. Rather than indulge in unproductive 
speculation, we telephoned the head of the president's press 
service, Anatoliy Krasikov. Here is what he said: 
  [Begin Krasikov recording] It had long been planned that 
they 
would see each other at some stage. After all, the government 
has prepared the draft budget for them to look at. This draft 
has been forwarded to the president, on the one hand, and to the 
Duma on the other. The Duma is starting to debate the draft. 
In other words, these issues have to be discussed. There are 
also a number of other practical questions. Right from the 
outset we said that the president was going there not just for a 
vacation but also to do some work. He is sending us documents. 
He is relaxing too. The other day he took a trip outside 
Sochi. So, he has done a little travelling in the North 
Caucasus. But he cannot cut himself off completely from 
political life in the country. So, he has to hold consultations 
with people here on the issues that the government is examining. 
This led to rumors that the president had returned to Moscow. 
He hasn't been in Moscow at all. Instead, he will meet 
Chernomyrdin there, on the spot, and discuss these things with 
him. 
  So, it's nothing to do with his health, or -- there have 
also 
been other rumors about some kind of coup and God knows what 
else. This is all a strategy aimed at whipping up tension, which 
suits certain people. [end recording]

  [Text] Sochi March 21 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin vacationing on the Black Sea met with Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday to discuss a range of political 
and economic issues. 
  Among the issues discussed were implementation of the 
president's state-of-the-nation address on strengthening Russian 
statehood, the state budget and ways to reach civic accord in 
the country, the presidential press service said. 
  Special attention was paid to the preparations for the 
upcoming spring sowing campaign in Russian agricultural regions, 
as well as the situation in Georgia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh 
and other issues. 
  After the one-to-one talks, the president and the premier 
were joined by Krasnodar regional administration head Nikolay 
Yegorov and Sochi mayor Nikolay Karpov. They agreed to set up 
working groups to work out a draft agreement on the delineation 
of powers between federal and local bodies of power as envisaged 
by the constitution and the federal treaty. 
  Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin supported the idea of holding the 
2002 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi.

  [Text] Valeriy Grishin, first deputy head of the Russian 
government press service, strongly denied rumors that telephones 
had been deliberately cut off in the government residence. 
  He told Interfax Monday that the telephone lines in the 
building had been put out of order by hot water from a broken 
pipeline. As a result, some telephones were cut off and some 
only receive calls from the city, while calling from them is 
hopeless. 
  Officials in the Communications Ministry confirmed for 
Interfax the fact of a breakdown in the pipeline which resulted 
in disruption of telephone links with the government 
headquarters. 
  City utility services on Monday intended to pump water out 
of 
the trench where the cable is laid. The cable itself is to be 
dried out Tuesday and the damage repaired. If need be, the 
entire lines will be replaced.

  [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- Russian First Deputy Prime 
Minister Oleg Soskovets denied press reports about his 
involvement in the alleged "anti-Yeltsin coup" and asked the 
office of the prosecutor general to clear up the accusations. 
  The "OBSHCHAYA GAZETA" said in its 11th edition that a 
"group 
of state officials" planned "to oust President Boris Yeltsin" 
and listed Soskovets among them. 
  Acting Prosecutor General Alexey Ilyushenko ordered to check 
the claims, the prosecutor's office said on Monday adding that 
the Interior Ministry, [and] the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service are also engaged in the investigation. 
  It added that all measures are being taken to check whether 
the press report corresponds to reality and warned that the 
newspaper may face criminal charges "of slander combined with 
accusation of a state crime" if the report was false.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Kiryanova: "President On Vacation: So The </F>
Local Kolkhoz Members Get it in the Neck"] 
  [Text] Krasnodar -- The Russian president, on vacation in 
Sochi, met there with Kuban Governor Nikolay Yegorov. They 
discussed questions of the development of agriculture, the fight 
against crime, restrictions on migration to the kray, and the 
stationing of military formations on its territory. The 
president approved the local administration's actions. 
  Boris Yeltsin was told of the active dissatisfaction of the 
heads of major collective farms in the kray with the latest 
recommendations by the president's analysis center. Anger at 
price parity that puts the countryside at a disadvantage, at tax 
policy, and so on is now commonplace. But the proposal on 
breaking up farms immediately, on the threshold of the spring 
sowing, provoked the most vigorous protest. 
  It is a delicate matter. Why indeed destroy something that 
is at least functioning, feeding, and providing a service. And 
actually doing not badly, by Russian standards. At any rate, in 
the Kuban agriculture is better developed than anywhere else in 
the Federation. And it is actually based on the kolkhozes, not 
on anything else -- for history deemed it so. 
  On the other hand, the local agrarian leaders are 
equivocating, claiming that the communal form of land use is a 
traditional one in the Kuban and cannot be revised. In the 
first place, it is not traditional, the Kuban has run the entire 
gamut in the past. Second, for decades no one has attempted to 
operate in any other way than as a kolkhoz. 
  Anyway, the latest news is that the president has been 
persuaded to leave the Kuban and its kolkhozes alone for the 
moment.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Bulygin report: "President Rests and Solves </F>
State Problems"] 
  [Text] Krasnodar Kray -- During his short vacation in 
Sochi, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin has spent more than 12 hours a 
day untying "Gordian knots." He is doing this by checking his 
plans against the opinions of regional leaders. 
  The meeting between the head of state and Kuban Governor 
Nikolay Yegorov lasted several hours. The latter admitted that 
he was pleasantly surprised by the president's knowledge of the 
state of affairs in Krasnodar Kray. That is why problems 
relating to the Kuban's economy and social and cultural spheres 
were discussed without any preamble. 
  The subject of the head of state's special concern was the 
development of the agrarian sector. The president focused 
attention on the need for more careful preparation and organized 
conduct of spring field work, and approved the measures being 
adopted by the kray leadership in this sphere. 
  Programs drawn up in the kray for the development of 
industry, construction, culture, the social sphere, and the 
fight against organized crime, and approaches to strengthening 
Russia's land and maritime borders with the Transcaucasus states 
and to the stationing of forces re-stationed in Kuban from 
nearby and more distant foreign countries, also met with 
Yeltsin's support. The president agreed with the proposals made 
by the head of the kray administration aimed at solving 
questions of interethnic relations, and he approved of the 
governor's intention to introduce a visa system for crossing the 
borders of Krasnodar Kray. B. Yeltsin advised Yegorov to 
present the relevant proposals to the federal authorities.

<F P=106> ["Left-Center Opposition Leaders' Appeal to Russian </F>
Federation Citizens" followed by Boris Slavin commentary under 
the general heading: "Accord for Russia"; last paragraph is 
Slavin commentary] 
  [Text] Various political blocs, coalitions, and alliances 
are taking shape in anticipation of possible presidential 
elections. Today we present an appeal by the left-center 
opposition, which has the blessing of Metropolitan Ioann of St. 
Petersburg and Ladoga: 
  There is calamity in our common Russian home. This is being 
discussed by families, on the street, in dying plants, and cold 
schools, it is being mentioned by the opposition and the 
government, religious and political figures, the Federal 
Assembly, and the president. Everyone secretly thinks the same 
-- we cannot go on living like this. A halt must be called. 
  We have one means of salvation -- we must come to our 
senses, 
extend our hands to one another in forgiveness of the mutual 
recriminations and transgressions. There will be no winners or 
losers in this confrontation. Each new conflict increases the 
danger of Russia's destruction. We contrast the folly of words 
and deeds with respect for the law and creative activity in the 
name of Russia. 
  A social contract between all patriotic forces, movements, 
ideologies, and faiths that reject violence, racism, and 
nationalism and that set civic service to the homeland above all 
else is what can stop the catastrophe. 
  The only freedom is that which brings prosperity to the 
fatherland, strengthens its independence, and provides 
guarantees of personal safety and faith in the future. 
  We people of different views, with a different way of life 
and thinking, representatives of various fragments of our 
multifaceted ideology and policy, state that we are setting up 
the movement "Accord for Russia," uniting all Russia's patriots 
-- as has frequently happened in times of trouble for Russia -- 
pooling our wealth, ability, and moral and political 
experience.... The "Accord for Russia" movement is open to all 
citizens in our multiethnic Russia who are able to help their 
fatherland at its time of severe trial. 
  We do not differentiate between liberals and communists, 
entrepreneurs and workers, private farmers, and kolkhoz workers, 
nor do we distinguish between republicans and supporters of 
presidential authority. We are uniting to perform urgent tasks 
in an endeavor: 
  -- to avert the definitive breakup of historic Russia, the 
destruction of the cultural, economic, and political ties that 
have developed over the centuries between its equal peoples; 
  -- to restore the power and might of Russia's statehood, 
providing its peoples and citizens with security and conditions 
for economic prosperity and the development of the individual; 
  -- to protect national cadres and the scientific, 
technical, and defense potential of our great country; 
  -- to stop reforms "for reforms' sake," the destruction of 
national production, protect the national market and national 
capital, and ensure conditions for Russia's move toward a 
postindustrial future; 
  -- to bar the way to rampant crime and looting of the 
wealth that has been created by the work of several generations 
of our people and provide legal protection for state and private 
property; 
  -- to avert unemployment and starvation, provide every 
citizen of the country with a fitting way of life and standard 
of living; 
  -- to restore our peoples' sense of community, membership 
of and pride in a sovereign state, and their belief in justice, 
conscience, and good. 
  We have behind us the constructive experience and heroism of 
Russia's great citizens and our homeland's patriots. We have 
behind us the experience of 1,000 years of Russian statehood. 
We will strive to secure national accord, the consolidation of 
society, and mobilize all patriotic citizens to restore ravaged 
errant Russia. 
  [Signed] V. Zorkin, A. Rutskoy, M. Lapshin, A. Tuleyev, S. 
Glazyev, G. Zyuganov, P. Romanov, S. Baburin, V. Lipitskiy, A. 
Prokhanov, G. Seleznev, V. Chikin. A. Shilov, S. Govorukhin, N. 
Mikhalkov, A. Tsipko. 
  Thus, a coalition of left-centrist forces -- effectively, 
the 
main popular-patriotic forces -- has been formed. The intended 
split in the opposition following the amnesty has not taken 
place. On the contrary, most opposition forces have united. 
They include politicians and representatives of the creative 
intelligentsia -- supporters of nonviolence and a rule-of-law 
state. The real democrats are wavering. But the door to the 
future is open to them. As for the radicals from "Russia's 
Choice" and "Democratic Russia," I think that they have had 
their day. Without simplifying the situation I will say: The 
way is closed to everyone who wants to see a repeat of October 
1994 [date as published].

  [Text] Aleksandr Rutskoy might agree to be put forward as a 
candidate for the post of Russian president, if there is a clear 
and definite objective need for me as a leader. The former vice 
president said this in an interview to the Japanese KYODO 
agency, noting that he has sufficient knowledge and strength to 
conduct an election campaign and then head the state.

  [Text] The Russian president's press service distributed a 
report today that says, in particular: 
  On 18 March, a number of newspapers published an appeal by a 
group of figures who announced the creation of an association 
that will be called Accord for Russia. The appeal was signed by 
a number of people known for the fact that, until recently, they 
held an irreconcilable stance vis-a-vis the president and his 
policies. The president's administration expects the new 
association to make a specific contribution to the preparation 
of an agreement on civil peace in Russia, and afterward, to its 
practical implementation. It is on the basis of these deeds 
that society will judge whether the intentions of the appeal's 
authors are sincere, the press service report says.

  [Text] Kirill Ignatyev, member of the Russia's Choice 
parliamentary group coordinating committee and member of the 
parliamentary information committee, described the setting up of 
an Accord in the Name of Russia movement as the emergence of 
"Rutskoy's small party." Rutskoy is likely to run in the next 
presidential race. 
  Ignatyev told Interfax that it was significant that the 
appeal to Russia's citizens which declared the setting up of the 
movement had not been signed by the Liberal Democratic Party 
whose leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will "beyond any doubt" run 
for presidency. 
  Ignatyev took note of the fact that the appeal had not been 
signed by opposition figures such as Viktor Anpilov and Viktor 
Tyulkin, the leader of the Russian Communist Party, a rival of 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, headed by Gennady 
Zyuganov, who did join the Accord in the Name of Russia. 
  Ignatyev thought that the setting up of a new movement 
reflected a deep split among counter-reformists and the tendency 
to build up various groups around presidential candidates. 
  He admitted, however, that "even though just a small number 
of counter-reformists rallied around the Accord, we must 
understand that the setting up of the so-called Rutskoy's party 
compels the democrats to consolidate." Russia's Choice would 
step up work on the setting up of its own party, he said.

  [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- "Five expert groups which 
are preparing concrete sections of the memorandum of accord -- 
on the economy, regional and national policy, security, law and 
culture and political life -- are completing their work on the 
document," Russian Presidential Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov 
said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that 
public accord is achievable on the basis of the memorandum. He 
expressed bewilderment over the attempts by some politicians to 
set up a new political bloc, "Accord for Russia." The 
participation of Constitutional Court member Valeriy Zorkin in 
this bloc revives the dispute about his inappropriate political 
activity which has already cost him his post of Constitutional 
Court chairman. 
  "There cannot be two consensuses. There can be only one 
consensus," Filatov said. Additionally, the idea proposed by 
Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, Zorkin, former 
vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy and others looks "militant." 
"One has to dislike his nation particularly strong in order to 
whip up fear in society," he added. 
  President Boris Yeltsin's senior adviser Georgiy Satarov 
said 
that a joint team of experts will hold a meeting on Wednesday to 
discuss the memorandum. On Thursday, the text of the document 
will be handed over to Yeltsin who is expected to return from 
vacation by the end of the week. "The achievement of civic 
accord is not a one- time process," he said. It is open to all 
who want to join it, Satarov said.

  [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- The Moscow regional court 
overruled today a lower court's decision stripping Russian 
nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of his seat in the 
State Duma. 
  The higher court annuled the decision of the district 
Shchelkovo court of February 25, which declared null and void 
the results of the parliamentary elections last year in the 
electoral district, in which Zhirinovskiy was elected to the the 
lower chamber of the Russian legislature. The court ruled that 
the decision was "inconsistent and surpassed the court's 
competency." 
  A statement issued today by Zhirinovskiy's Liberal 
Democratic 
Party press service mockingly expressed "sympathy for certain 
politicians and mass media who failed again in their campaign to 
discredit Vladimir Zhirinovskiy."

that the country's political situation will deteriorate sharply 
in April. Speaking today at the eighth regional party conference

LDPR will be victorious at the presidential elections. In his 
opinion, neither the Communists nor the new Zorkin-Rutskoy 
coalition nor any other opposition politicians have any chance 
of winning today.

  [Text] Law enforcement bodies will use the entire arsenal 
of special means to prevent possible mass unrest in Moscow. 
This was reported by Yuriy Baturin, an aide to the Russian 
president for national security, in an interview to ITAR-TASS. 
According to him, the opposition groupings rejecting the 
Memorandum proposed by President Boris Yeltsin are preparing to 
hold major rallies and demonstrations in Moscow in May. To 
prevent a repeat of the events of May 1993, it is envisaged to 
use a number of technical contact-free means, including 
water-cannons. Yuriy Baturin stressed that in case of public 
order violations, legal mechanisms will be put into effect 
without delay, especially against those to whom the political 
amnesty was extended.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 18 March broadcasts a regular 10-minute 
long "Details" program, presented by correspondent Sergey 
Dorenko, which is devoted to recent rumors about preparations 
for a coup in Russia and Yeltsin's poor health. Dorenko says 
that today practically everybody is talking publicly and openly 
about a conspiracy but the authorities are silent and behave 
almost as if they are participants in this plot. Today there 
were numerous meetings and sittings in the Kremlin and around 
it. People have discussed what to say, with whom to talk, and 
who will talk about the recent rumors. Many of them say they 
have nothing to talk about because there has been no coup. Some 
of them are afraid that if they talk about this with somebody, 
later the president may learn about it and, possibly, 
misinterpret their remarks. 
  Dorenko then says: "The latest information is that today 
some 
people from the State Duma called the Kremlin and asked one of 
the president's assistants whether it is true that the president 
was delivered by air this afternoon from Sochi in very bad 
condition so he could be treated here. Well, around ten people 
in the Kremlin say that this is a lie. But all of them are 
saying that they will not talk about this in front of the 
camera. We know that in the near future a certain event is to 
take place in Sochi where journalists with cameras will be 
invited and they will be able to show the healthy president to 
the people. The apparatus is working with awful delays which we 
would like to explain by the fact that they are simply doing 
their work inefficiently. The only person in the Kremlin who is 
not afraid to speak for television at all is Georgiy Satarov, 
the president's assistant." 
  The video then shows Georgiy Satarov giving an interview to 
Yelena Karayeva, an RTV correspondent. She asks him to comment 
on the rumors about Yeltsin's poor health. He says there are 
forces that would prefer to have a bad situation in the country. 
The correspondent asks him to explain whom he means. Satarov 
says: "There are two kinds of politicians. We are talking about 
those who are in principle outside legal politics and do not use 
legal methods, and those who, let us say, do not have experience 
in public politics and they know full well that they do not have 
chances, even if they are respectable people, they do not have 
chances to come to power as a result of a normal democratic 
process. These kind of people do exist. I am talking, above 
all, about the type and not about specific persons." He adds 
that he cannot speak about any particular person because he has 
no real facts. 
  The correspondent asks Georgiy Satarov whether former KGB 
members and former bosses of the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
who have money and real power even now could start to use all 
kinds of propaganda to influence people. Satarov says: "Yes, 
potentially, of course, this could be done. But I do not know 
for sure whether such a team exists or not at the present time. 
But some facts could be interpreted in this way." But he adds 
that he does not have enough facts to confirm this. 
  The correspondent then says that today they tried to speak 
about all these issues with many prominent political figures but 
they all refused to speak with journalists and said that they 
were too busy. Satarov says that it was difficult for him to 
find time for this interview as well and he has only a few 
minutes. He adds: "But on the other hand we should speak about 
this because, of course, people are interested to know where the 
president is, what he is doing, why he decided to have a rest 
and what all this means. Of course, they should know this and 
we should speak about it." 
  Presenter Sergey Dorenko then continues to comment on this 
issue. He says that despite the fact that the authorities do 
not want to speak about this it is clear that the Kremlin is 
very anxious about these rumors. For example, Yuriy Baturin has 
interrupted his holiday and returned to Moscow and Stepashin 
urgently returned to work after his illness. 
  Dorenko then discusses who was the organizer of these rumors 
and who would benefit because of them. There are several 
versions. One of them is that the president himself has 
organized all this so as to introduce a state of emergency in 
the country and thus, to get rid of opposition. This is a very 
weak argument. The second version says that some politicians 
like Soskovets, Luzhkov, or Skokov want to come to power now 
because they are afraid that "foolish and unpredictable" voters 
will allow Zhirinovskiy or Rutskoy to come to power. But the 
president supports these politicians and even considers Luzhkov 
as one of his possible successors. Communists are not 
interested in these rumors either because they do not have 
control over the Army and they hope to win only at open 
democratic elections. So, it seems as if there are no people 
who would be interested in all that. But the presenter adds 
that according to Yuriy Baturin these rumors are some kind of 
smoke-screen. He concludes: "When everybody gets used to talks 
about a conspiracy and stops paying any attention to them 
everything will start and we will learn the name of the author 
of the present artillery preparation."

  [Text] Vladivostok March 18 TASS -- A rally in support of 
ex-Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov was held on Thursday night 
on Vladivostok central square. The ex-mayor's supporters 
estimated his removal from the post as a "gross violation of 
human rights, non-observation of the Russian constitution and 
laws and the return to 1937". 
  The rally attended by several hundred persons adopted a 
resolution to demand that the higher instances remove Maritime 
governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko and Maritime procurator Valeriy 
Vasilenko from their posts. 
  A reason for the demand of Vasilenko's resignation is "the 
lack of the territorial procurator's office control over 
lawfulness and permission of the eviction of the legitimately- 
elected mayor from his study with the use of force". 
  According to reliable sources, Viktor Cherepkov has gone on 
a 
hunger strike and is staying at home. 
  As for ex-mayor's Deputy Vladimir Gilgenberg, pushed out 
from 
the mayor's office, he has not been produced any documents to 
substantiate his removal from the mayor deputy post. Asked 
about reasons for this situation, senior assistant of the 
Maritime Territorial Procurator Veniamin Chichayev told 
ITAR-TASS "It is not the business of the procurator's office, 
and acting Vladivostok Mayor Konstantin Tolstoshein has the 
right to choose his deputies himself". 
  Criminal proceedings instituted against Viktor Cherepkov on 
charge of major bribe-taking in February 1994 have been taken 
over by the Russian procurator general's office.

  [Text] Vladivostok, 19 Mar -- "People have breathed a sigh 
of relief," Vladivostok's new head of administration Konstantin 
Tolstoshein affirms. He told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that 
at the first planning meeting he told the Mayoralty officials: 
"Whoever does not agree to work with us can be dismissed." 
Tolstoshein noted that "so far few have expressed such a wish." 
Today he and his assistants have been at their desks since 
early morning. 
  As already reported, criminal proceedings have been 
instituted against the Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov. He 
has been accused of accepting bribes amounting to 3 million 
rubles. At the decision of the kray administration he has been 
removed from his post. The proceedings have been temporarily 
suspended until the arrival in Vladivostok of the investigator 
for especially important cases of the Procuracy-General, 
Konstantin Mavrin. 
  "For ten months the former head of administration Viktor 
Cherepkov and his team thoroughly neglected the town's economy, 
including the building from which they administered the town," 
Konstantin Tolstoshein noted. "Apart from the documentation 
which the Procuracy has to sort out, everything there is 
tangled. No debit and credit books were kept, accounts were not 
kept properly. As a result financial funds were spent without 
thought." 
  The newspaper BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK Tolstoshein affirms, 
"reflected the interests of Cherepkov and received at his 
personal order several hundred million rubles. And that at a 
time when there is a catastrophic lack of funds for social needs 
and the town's municipal economy is neglected. Seeing their 
extravagant masters, the officials of lesser rank were none too 
thrifty with the taxpayers' money either." 
  Konstantin Tolstoshein said: "When I was asked to become 
head of the town administration, I thought for a long time. I 
realized it would be difficult: the townsfolk had been fooled by 
Cherepkov's populist slogans and promises. I myself am a native 
of Maritime Kray. I started as building site foreman, I became 
district administration head, then headed the committee for 
military industry of the kray's admidnistration. I am no 
stranger to difficulties."

<F P=106> ["Report by Gennadiy Zyuganov at the CPRF Central Executive </F>
Committee Plenum, 15 March 1994," under the general heading: 
"What Is To Be Done Next?"] 
  [Text] We must devote today's plenum to a serious 
discussion of our party's situation, its internal state, and its 
place in the present-day political arena in the ranks of the 
united opposition. We are to discuss the theses for the 
formulation of the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation] Program "From Crisis to Stable Development," the 
resolution "On State Patriotism," and the CPRF's attitude to 
religion. 
<H5>  A Hundred Days After the Elections </H5>
  Recently, and especially in the past six months, the 
opposition, and the Communists as its largest and best-organized 
detachment, have undergone severe trials. The CPRF has emerged 
from these trials, on the whole, in a well-organized manner, 
having retained the capacity to conduct broad, Russia-wide 
political actions such as the 12 December elections, and 
enriched by experience of parliamentary work that is new to it. 
But are there grounds for complacency? No, there are not. 
  The truth must be faced: The opposition is operating under 
extremely difficult conditions. Virtually all its energy is 
going on mere survival. We did not allow ourselves to be routed 
in the coup d'etat, but we were unable to rebuff the coup, and 
are now having to "play" by rules imposed from outside. The 
opposition has failed either to prevent or substantially to 
delay the development of the socioeconomic situation according 
to the most negative scenario. 
  Time is passing, and the systemic crisis is deepening. 
Damaging distortions in the economy, social relations, 
politics, and the moral and spiritual sphere have reached a 
stage where they could become irreversible. The country is in 
effect consuming and using up the last material and human 
reserves which it could have used to overcome its catastrophic 
condition. 
  Urgent countermeasures are needed. After the December 
elections many organizations, especially at primary and rayon 
level, came up against the question: "What is to be done 
next?", and they do not always find an answer. The consequence 
is that organizations become inward-looking, the old squabbles 
and splits are renewed, and numbers are falling. 
  The party's central organs bear their share of 
responsibility 
for this. In the past months we have devoted the greater part 
of our efforts to setting our parliamentary activity in motion. 
  In principle the Central Executive Committee Presidium is 
aware that mastering the methods of parliamentary struggle is an 
important landmark in the formation of a fully functional 
political party, but that this is not the full extent of party 
tasks. The faction should put all its potential at the service 
of the party, rather than the party serving as an appendage to 
the faction. 
  The growing pains we are experiencing today indicate that 
the 
process of the CPRF's formation as a political party with a wide 
arsenal of forms and methods of organizing the working people to 
fight for their vital interests is only just beginning and is 
far from complete. A difficult path has to be traveled, and in 
the context of an acute shortage of time. 
  Our positions and influence on the masses are significantly 
weakened by the fact that the party does not yet have a detailed 
theoretical program for the long term. The Program Statement 
adopted by the Second Congress, the Central Executive Committee 
Presidium letter to Communists last summer, and a number of 
press statements by leadership members have been important 
stages in this work. 
<H5>  Let Us Define Together the Model of Socialism </H5>
  The theses for the formulation of the party program are 
offered for the attention of the plenum participants today. 
Their very title indicates that work on the main party document 
must continue. A number of problems remain open, and these 
cannot be "closed" simply by repeating the tried and tested 
tenets of Marxist-Leninist doctrine (as has been done in the 
programs of certain left-wing parties). These include, first 
and foremost, questions of the nature of the emerging technical 
and economic structure on the basis of which socialism is to 
gain its second wind; the fundamentally new situation developing 
in the "man-society-nature" system, etc. It is also necessary 
thoroughly to analyze the causes of the crisis in the model of 
socialism that developed in the USSR. In short, a new 
contribution to the theory of socialism is required. 
Incidentally, communists abroad are also waiting for us to do 
this. 
  Clearly, in such a case it is better to think everything 
through yet again than to arrive at overhasty decisions. The 
following procedure for further work on the program is therefore 
proposed. After today's exchange of opinions, further work on 
the theses will continue, with wide discussion of them being 
organized in the country's party organizations. They will be 
discussed again at the conference in April and adopted as a 
partywide document. The final version of the program will be 
drawn up on the basis of these theses and adopted at the third 
party congress in the fall of this year. 
  We must act considerably more promptly in formulating 
another 
document which we urgently need. I am referring to the action 
program defining the party's strategy and tactics in the 
conditions of deepening crisis over the next 18 months to two 
years. This program could be adopted as early as the April 
conference. 
  I wish to stress that it is not a question of a 
"conventional" anticrisis program of the kind that opposition 
parties and movements have already put forward plenty of. 
Suffice it to recall our own theses for a preelection platform, 
as well as the platform specifically drawn up for the December 
elections. Here we listed, in the conventional manner, the 
measures that we would adopt if we were in power. Necessary as 
programs of this kind are, their Achilles heel was that they 
remained only promises for the future or -- at best -- menacing 
demands on the authorities. We remember well what the 
authorities did when they heard our demands. 
  Therefore, without departing in any way from the substance 
of 
those demands, we should formulate our tasks not as a ruling 
force, but specifically as an opposition force, and construct a 
program of concrete action not simply on the basis of 
considerations of the need for this or that measure, but on the 
basis of the party's actual position and its present forces and 
potential, with a view first and foremost to extending that 
potential and strengthening the party's influence on social 
processes. 
  Allow me to set forth the basic ideas which, in our view, 
could form the basis of the program for the CPRF's next actions 
and its strategy and tactics for the period ahead. 
<H5>  Immediate Actions and the Most Important Demands </H5>
  Being in opposition to the political and socioeconomic 
course 
of the president and his government and assessing that course as 
antipopular and ruinous to the state, the CPRF believes that its 
priority task is to promote the quest for and creation of the 
political conditions for a peaceful solution to the crisis. The 
irresponsible actions of executive structures, headed by the 
president, have already in effect plunged the country into a 
slow-moving civil war which threatens at any moment to develop 
into a full-scale one. But that way lies the abyss. 
  Since, literally in the last few days, talk of accord and 
reconciliation has suddenly become universal, a kind of fashion, 
it is necessary to explain what we see as the essence of civil 
peace and the conditions for its restoration. 
  First, civil peace does not mean universal brotherhood or 
the 
elimination of all possible disagreements. It is a means of 
resolving them nonviolently. The struggle between different 
social trends is inevitable, but it must not lead to the ruin of 
the state, its economy, and its social and spiritual sphere. In 
order to prevent this, a broad social and political coalition 
must be formed on the basis of recognition of national and state 
interests and the values of popular accord, a movement capable, 
by virtue of its weight and influence, of neutralizing and 
isolating -- politically, economically, and morally -- the 
"civil war party," which represents criminal, comprador, 
corrupt, and lumpen elements. 
  With goodwill and elementary social responsibility, the 
political spectrum of such a coalition could prove very broad: 
from communists and socialists, through national patriots and 
centrists, to democrats -- without quotation marks. 
  Second, we must stress that the movement to restore civil 
peace is not confined to verbal nods in the right direction, but 
must be backed up by concrete steps. Here the amnesty declared 
by the Duma and the freeing of political prisoners is only the 
first step. Having voted in the Duma for the Memorandum on 
Accord, the Communist faction has also formulated further 
conditions necessary for national reconciliation: 
  1. A change of socioeconomic course and the formulation of a 
national-state doctrine, taking into account all the 1,000 years 
of experience of Russian statehood. We declare frankly that 
Russia will not overcome the crisis without socialist 
development. 
  2. The formation of a government of national confidence, 
based on a parliamentary majority and monitored by and 
accountable to the Duma. This presupposes the departure of 
detested figures such as Chubays, Kozyrev, and others. 
  3. An end to the humiliation of the Army and organs of state 
security and the militia, and the prevention of their use as a 
gendarmerie and an instrument of internal political struggle. 
Conversion. 
  4. The renunciation of ideological vengeance and of the 
abasement of science, culture, and traditional religions. Two 
laws. 
  5. The immediate restoration of debts to peasants, wages to 
the workers, medicines and support to old people, and free 
education to children and students. The agrarian sector of the 
economy must take priority. The citizens of the country must 
get the minimum consumer basket. 
  6. Emergency measures to combat corruption, organized crime, 
and banditry. Assured security for everyone. 
  7. A guarantee of the objective exposition of the positions 
of all political forces in the state mass media and the 
preservation of a nationwide information area. 
  8. The restoration of a renewed union state on a voluntary 
basis on the initiative of the Russian Federation -- a 
legislative initiative. 
  Thus, civil peace is not a single act of signing some kind 
of 
pompous declaration. It is a complex, comprehensive process, 
and at the present stage its interests should determine our 
attitude toward all sociopolitical realities: the president and 
his administration, the government, the various draft laws and 
social initiatives, political parties, strikes, and other mass 
protests. 
<H5>  Widening of the Social Base, Formation of a Coalition </H5>
  The strategic gask at the present stage is the widening of 
the social base of the opposition and the formation, on this 
basis, of a coalition of people's patriotic forces which would 
assume government of the state through election victory. It is 
not ruled out that early elections will be necessary. In any 
case, the early presidential elections which the striking miners 
are demanding today could -- provided Yeltsin and the other 
organizers of the coup d'etat do not take part -- be the best 
way out of the situation of confrontation. The amnesty was, 
after all, adopted so as to ensure the most painless opportunity 
for the departure of all those politicians who have -- 
deliberately or otherwise -- dragged the country into chaos and 
fratricide. But there is no great hope that the "civil war 
party" will correctly assess the magnanimity of the State Duma. 
  The implementation of the above plan will largely be 
determined by the social and psychological characteristics of 
the present moment. 
  Today society is in a phase of low social activeness. The 
number and scale of mass movements of various kinds are 
declining and there is clear evidence of people having had 
enough of politics and retreating into private life. At the 
moment it is rather difficult to get people together to support 
even the most just of causes. Similar periods have always been 
favorable times for all kinds of backstage intrigues and deals 
at the highest level, for palace coups. 
  On the other hand there is mounting disillusionment with the 
course and faith is disappearing in the latest "bright future," 
a capitalist one this time. There is a gradual shift to the 
left under way in public mood but so far it is still a passive 
shift, expressed mainly in the form of voting for left-wing 
forces. 
  But the general deterioration in the masses' economic 
situation and the continuation of inflation combined with the 
decline in production and the transformation of concealed 
unemployment into open unemployment are making strikes and other 
active social protest actions inevitable. But here there is a 
great likelihood that these actions will remain mainly 
spontaneous, uncoordinated, and ineffectual. 
  That is why there will be an even greater increase in hopes 
of the arrival of a "strong individual," a kind of "social 
messiah," and a naive faith in simple and extremely rapid 
solutions for all problems. Favorable ground is being formed 
for new illusions, demagoguery, and populism. 
  In these extremely contradictory conditions the party's main 
line of conduct is calmly, without getting involved in 
adventures and without succumbing to likely acts of provocation, 
in collaboration with all patriotic forces to expand its 
influence on all social processes and in all strata of society 
and to prepare for the inevitable new social upsurge 
ideologically and organizationally in order to be able to direct 
it into not a spontaneous and destructive channel but a creative 
one. 
  Are we ready to resolve these tasks? We have a certain 
amount of work in hand. Today the CPRF is perhaps the only 
party with a "full profile" organizational structure and quite 
good prospects of creating a similar network of deputies' 
factions and groups. 
<H5>  Turning the Party to Face Society </H5>
  But the effectiveness of party structures so far remains 
low. 
As I have already said, the organizations are inward-looking and 
often have no ties even with each other or with higher ranking 
committees. Organizational work is now a weak spot in party 
organs of all levels, including central organs. And let us be 
frank: The age and social composition of our primary 
organizations so far fails to meet the requirements of the time. 
This is in no wise a rebuke, merely a statement of fact. We 
must realize that vast social and demographic strata -- 
primarily the working class and young people -- are outside the 
sphere of steady party influence, and that processes in the 
labor collectives, that is precisely where the most complex knot 
of present-day problems has been tied, are proceeding without 
our influence. 
  Closed party groups and closed party measures often become 
the place where like-minded people in their narrow circle 
unburden their hearts, cursing the existing regime, and are 
essentially a means of psychological defusing, not psychological 
mobilization. And several levels above that are street meetings, 
also a virtually unchanging cast of players, and also 
increasingly reduced to the role of a psychological 
safety-valve. The task is to turn the party to face society. 
To stop stewing in our own juice and to reach a new level of 
political activeness as close as possible to daily life, to the 
needs and concerns of people with no interest in politics and no 
faith in any parties. Only in this way can we expand the 
party's sphere of influence and the basis of its social support. 
  What can the primary territorial and professional party 
organizations do here? A number of tasks are perfectly obvious 
and lie on the surface. They must be resolved constantly. 
  The dissemination of the opposition press. And not among our 
"own" people but among the "others." It is enough for a 
territorial group to set up a permanent newspaper kiosk in a 
prominent place and to ensure the delivery of the press and in 
their concern for its content, updating, and restoration the 
group will instantly forget the meaning of the words "we don't 
know what to do with ourselves." 
  The defense of rights. And not "in general" but specific 
legal and moral aid for specific citizens in defending their 
rights as consumers, apartment tenants, pensioners, and so 
forth. In our organizations there are people who have the 
necessary education, experience of life, and free time for this 
and who still have the strength to take on this burden. 
  Elections. To ensure that this event does not take us 
unawares each time it is obviously necessary to create 
permanently operating election committees. Their functions 
should include the selection and preparation of potential 
candidates for elected posts in the administrations and 
representative organs of all levels; the compilation of detailed 
socioeconomic and political "portraits" of the relevant 
territories and the elaboration and constant updating of 
election programs on their basis; and the training of a staff of 
activists so that from the moment they start to collect 
signatures through to voting day each person knows "his move." 
  In brief, without fearing accusations of "opportunism and 
reformism" (which -- let there be no doubt of it! -- will ensue 
immediately) we must openly and honestly adopt the so-called 
"theory of small deeds." Let us remember Lenin: "If something 
kills us, it will be the revolutionary phrase." 
  Of course these deeds are by no means small. Our 
organizations may not have the strength even to fulfill the 
above-mentioned tasks. But in reality the party's current daily 
tasks are even broader. The party cannot exist and develop 
fully unless Communists take a personal part in the activity of 
all existing social organizations and structures and pursue 
their line through these organizations and structures. 
  Among these organizations the most important for us are the 
labor collective councils (where they still exist), the trade 
unions, and the strike committees. And in general the extension 
of the communist party's influence to the labor collectives is 
the number one tasks. Other parties are also setting themselves 
this task. 
  So far the CPRF has paid utterly inadequate attention to 
this 
question. We see our immediate task here in setting up 
relations with trade unions at all level while at the same time 
helping to establish independent trade unions of a left-wing, 
socialist orientation. 
  We would be making out that what we want is reality if we 
were to start to claim that in its present state the party can 
embark on the solution of urgent problems, relying mainly on the 
initiative, experience, and cadres of local organizations. No, 
here, as before, leadership and control from above are needed, 
serious methodological and material aid are needed. The Central 
Executive Committee and its commissions and expert consultative 
groups must immediately gather, generalize, and analyze 
available experience and on this basis prepare standard 
methodological recommendations for the main avenues of work. 
Special cadres training will also be needed. It is also clear 
that it is already impossible to organize and coordinate the 
party's activity even at rayon level on a voluntary basis. It 
is essential to form an institute of full-time party organizers, 
using for this the material potential of CPRF factions and 
groups in representative organs. 
  These factions themselves, primarily in the State Duma, must 
become a serious school for mastering the science of state 
administration and the attentive study of the situation and 
legislative activity. It is simply frivolous to speak of coming 
to power without this basic preparation. 
<H5>  Following Traditions, Looking into the Future </H5>
  Now about one more field of activity which is obviously in 
need of considerable consolidation. That is information, 
agitation, and propaganda. To this day the party does not have 
its own press organ. There are several reasons for this and 
primarily, of course, financial difficulties. Perhaps there is 
a need to announce a special collection of funds for a party 
newspaper (which, of course, does not do away with the 
Communists' statutory duty to pay their membership dues 
regularly). But it is not only a matter of finance. Even our 
supplement in SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA is published only rarely and 
does not fully perform the role either of a collective agitator 
or of a collective organizer. I am obliged to admit that no one 
in the Central Executive Committee and its apparatus is 
specially concerned with this matter or rendering assistance to 
the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA editorial office. I think there is no 
need to explain the harm the entire party is suffering as a 
result. Right now a number of options are being worked out for 
rectifying the situation and the problem must be resolved 
without fail in time for the conference. 
  Our ideological and agitation and propaganda work must be 
subordinated to the task of forming in the public consciousness 
an image of the CPRF as the party of Soviet state patriotism and 
social justice. The CPRF preserves the historical continuity of 
the communist and workers movement and loyalty to its best 
traditions and at the same time looks into the future. Our 
slogan is not "back to socialism" but "forward to socialism." 
  Today, when an increasing number of people are becoming 
convinced of the monstrous historical error that was committed 
by the division of the Soviet Union, it is important to stress 
in particular the direct connection between the implementation 
of the socialist idea and the idea of restoring the union state 
and the Soviet form of the power of the people on a new basis. 
This year several jubilees are being celebrated recalling the 
great importance of the unity of the fraternal peoples. It is 
the 340th anniversary of the Pereyaslavskaya rada [meeting of 
Ukrainian people which decided to reunite with Russia] and the 
reunification of Ukraine with Russia; the 80th anniversary of 
the start of World War I; the 50th anniversary of the day of the 
complete liberation of USSR territory from the German fascist 
invaders. And, of course, the greatest jubilee of all -- the 
50th anniversary of victory -- is approaching. We will 
celebrate the birth centenary of G.K. Zhukov, the greatest 
military leader of all time and all peoples. We must celebrate 
all these dates fittingly, together with all Soviet people, 
together with the Communists of Ukraine, Belorussia [Belarus], 
and other republics. 
  Comrades! The depth and complexity of the range of 
problems I have outlined forces us to raise again and again the 
question of the unity of actions of the left-wing and patriotic 
forces and of the communist movement in particular. 
  It is known that in the majority of regions Communists 
belonging to different parties operate as virtually a single 
organization. In this connection numerous demands are being made 
on the central organs for the speediest unification. There is a 
widespread opinion that this is being prevented only by the 
leaders' personal ambitions. Of course there is that. But we 
cannot fail to see that we are also divided by substantial 
policy and tactical differences. 
  On the basis of experience since August we have reached the 
following conclusion. Under present conditions the real unity 
of the communist movement can be ensured not through the formal 
unification of leading organs and leaders of different parties 
and groupings, not through the eclectic mutual amendment of 
their theoretical platforms, but through an exclusively correct 
program of specific practical actions stemming from the 
objective conditions of the current moment. We believe that the 
CPRF's decision to go to the December elections and the package 
of election documents adopted at the time was such a program, 
which united Communists "from below" while many members of the 
left-wing parties were sometimes working actively counter to 
direct bans from their central organs. 
  Our task must continue to be not to suit all tastes but to 
formulate correctly the Communists' current and strategic tasks 
and to organize their solution. We must complete this work at 
the party conference in April and today we must discuss how best 
to prepare for the conference.

  [Text] "Russia is being ruled by an anti-Russian, 
anti-popular regime which while speaking about democracy shot at 
the parliament, destroyed the economy and is driving the country 
to hunger," Russian Communists' leader Gennadiy Zyuganov told a 
rally of opposition supporters in Moscow. The rally in the 
Small Arena of the Luzhnikiy Stadium was timed to the third 
anniversary of the referendum of the future of the former Soviet 
Union. 
  According to the police, about 3,000-4,000 people took part 
in the rally. 
  On March 17 1991, about 70 percent of the voters favored the 
preservation of a renovated Soviet Union. 
  According to Zyuganov, "the ruling regime is devastating 
Russia as a superpower and destroying its science and culture. 
But the conscience of the people is waking up." Zyuganov 
pointed to the need for an immediate adjustment of the course of 
reforms, the formation of a government of popular confidence, 
"an end to the destruction of the army and state security bodies 
and the restoration of a united state." 
  The leader of the Russian All-People Union, Sergey Baburin, 
said that "justice demanded an uncompromising struggle against 
those who dismantled the Soviet Union. We are ready for civic 
accord, but we expect the sinners to make the first step." 
  According to Baburin, if President Yeltsin "wanted peace, 
let 
him come to us and repent." He called on opposition forces for 
consolidation and pointed out: "We will resuscitate our 
fatherland (meaning the Soviet Union - IF's note) despite any 
obstacles." 
  In his address to the rally, Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov 
proposed the movement Accord for Russia be turned into another 
movement called Accord for Restoration of the Soviet Union. He 
also proposed the new movement set up its regional committees to 
encompass local nationalist, patriotic and pro-Communist forces. 
The committees could organize the struggle for the restoration 
of the Soviet Union, Lukyanov was quoted as saying. 
  The rally was also attended by former Soviet Deputy Sazhiy 
Umalatova, Secretary General of the Communist Bolshevik Party of 
All Soviet Union Nina Andreyeva and Russian Communist Workers' 
Party Secretary Viktor Anpilov.

  [Text] Moscow March 19 TASS -- The Russian National Sobor 
(Assembly) (RNS), headed by Former KGB General Aleksandr 
Sterligov, should be transformed into a political organisation 
"so that it could participate in the formation of power and 
administration bodies of the Russian Federation", speakers said 
at a meeting of the Moscow City conference of the RNS here on 
Saturday. An RNS congress is to be held in Suzdal early in 
April to adopt a charter of the organisation. 
  The conference was addressed by RNS leader Aleksandr 
Sterligov. He made an evaluation of the situation in the 
country, noting disunity among the ranks of the patriotic forces 
of Russia. 
  It follows from Sterligov's remarks the RNS has virtually 
lost all allies after the events of the Autumn last year and the 
December parliamentary elections. Sterligov pointed out the 
correctness of the RNS' principled position of nonalignment with 
respect to the National Salvation Front as well as 
non-participation in the latest elections.

they are called upon to fight terrorism at gas production

The bulk of the group is made up of former KGB and Internal

  [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin signed a decree "On suspension of a resolution of the 
Leningrad Regional Government," the Presidential Press Service 
Reports. The decree runs as follows: 
  "Bearing in mind, the resolution of the Leningrad Regional 
Government of February 7, 1994, #5 'on measures for preparations 
and holding of elections of the Leningrad Regional Legislative 
Assembly, local government bodies and a regional referendum on 
draft rules of the Leningrad region' in part of holding the 
regional referendum on draft rules of the Leningrad region 
violates Paragraph 2 of Article 66 of the Russian Constitution, 
under which rules of a territory, a region, a federal city, an 
autonomous region and an autonomous district shall be adopted by 
a legislative (representative) body of corresponding subject of 
the Russian Federation and being guided by Paragraph 2 of 
Article 85 of the Russian Constitution, I resolute: 
  - to suspend the validity of the resolution of the Leningrad 
Regional Government of February 7, 1994, #5 `On measures for 
preparations and holding of elections of the Legislative 
Assembly of the Leningrad region, local government bodies and a 
regional referendum on draft rules of the Leningrad region' in 
part of holding the regional referendum on draft rules of the 
Leningrad region". 
  The Leningrad regional Government scheduled for March 20, 
1994, a regional referendum on draft rules of the Leningrad 
region. 
  This decision was protested against the regional procurator 
as not corresponding to Article 66 of the Russian Constitution. 
Under this article, such legal acts shall be adopted by 
legislative (representative) body of a corresponding federation 
subject. However, such a body has not been elected in the 
Leningrad region. The elections of the Regional Legislative 
Assembly are scheduled for March 20. 
  The regional government rejected the protest of the 
procurator, and the president used his constitutional right to 
suspend the regional government's resolution on the referendum, 
although he has nothing against the rules themselves.

  [Text] The talks between Russia and the IMF have reached an 
impasse. As a result of this the most likely consequence will 
be the IMF's refusal to grant Russia the second part of the 
systematic credit of $1.5 billion. I remind you that the first 
part of the credit was given to Moscow in 1993. 
  INTERFAX, quoting informed sources, reports that the main 
reason for the probable refusal is the deficit of almost 10 
percent in the draft budget approved by the government. Sources 
claim that during the discussion and approval of the budget by 
the State Duma the deficit will grow even more. 
  Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Federation Council's budget 
committee, commented on the possible refusal to grant the credit 
at the request of our radio station: 
  [Begin Gonchar recording] I think that this is not the only 
reason that the talks with the IMF have ended as they have. In 
order for me to draw any conclusions I would have to look at 
more detailed documents, but I think that the main reason, from 
my point of view, is the fall in production. The fact is that 
inflation is caused by two things, and the main one -- as Yegor 
Timofeyevich Gaydar used to speak about at sessions of the 
former Supreme Soviet -- is the fall in production. From 
February 1993 to February 1994 production fell by 24 percent. I 
think that the defining factor was not the level of inflation, 
but the ability to overcome it. But I repeat again that this is 
a very serious document and needs deeper analysis. [end 
recording] 
  At the same time this afternoon the Russian Finance Ministry 
and the IMF mission will renew their bilateral talks on offering 
the second part of the systematic credit in the context of the 
conditions put forward by the IMF's managing director, Michel 
Camdessus. INTERFAX was told this by a high-ranking spokesman 
in the Finance Ministry. The source refused to say exactly what 
these conditions are, but he noted that they, I quote, 
considerably complicate the progress of the talks. According to 
the source, on Sunday evening a meeting was held in the Finance 
Minstry at which the head of the IMF attached new conditions to 
the question of offering Russia $1.5 billion. Camdessus has not 
put forward such conditions previous to this meeting.

  [Text] The POSTFACTUM agency, referring to sources close to 
the leadership of the IMF, has circulated a report that talks 
between the IMF leadership and the Russian Government have 
reached an impasse. The report also says that the IMF 
leadership is examining the question of the closure of its 
mission in Moscow. The Moscow mission of the IMF told a Mayak 
correspondent that this report by the POSTFACTUM agency is 
misinformation. Talks between the IMF delegation and Russian 
representatives are continuing at present. It is expected that 
Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, will meet with 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government again 
tomorrow.

  [Text] On Monday Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin 
submitted to the Russian State Budget [as received] a draft law 
on federal budget spending in the second quarter of 1994. 
  Under the draft in the second quarter the Russian Central 
Bank is to lend the government 10.6 trillion rubles for covering 
the federal budget deficit. The loan will be given for 10 years 
at 10 268460096nterest with repayment in equal installments beginning 
in 1998. 
  In his message to the Duma the prime-minister said that 
before the draft law is approved the government intends to 
earmark means proceeding from budget plans and considering the 
actual spending in the first quarter. 
  According to preliminary reports, in the first quarter 
federal budget spending has been as follows: 
  on the economy -908 Bn rbls, 
  government investments 969 Bn, 
  on social and cultural programs 1109 Bn, 
  on defence 3627 Bn, 
  on law enforcement bodies 1077 Bn, 
  to local budgets under mutual settlements, including 
subsidies and subventions 2080 Bn. 
  The budget message also said that taxes and payments to the 
budget in the first two months amount to 4.7 trillion. The 
figure predicted by the government for March should not exceed 
3.3 trillion. 
  The prime-minister pointed to the reduction of the share of 
taxes and payments in the federal budget. Last January the debt 
of Bashkiria to the federal budget was 52 Bn rubles, Tatarstan 
37 Bn and Yakutia 32 Bn.

  [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- The mayors of Russia's three 
largest cities -- Yuriy Luzhkov of Moscow, Anatoliy Sobchak of 
St. Petersburg and Aleksandr Chernetskiy of Yekaterinburg have 
appealed to President Boris Yeltsin to veto the new customs duty 
rates, which the Russian federal government introduced from 
March 10. 
  The mayors fear that the new tariffs will endanger the 
provision of food to the country's major cities. They cite 
specialists who say that the decision on new rates will further 
rupture traditional trade links between Russia and "near abroad" 
and lead to an abrupt reduction of import food deliveries. 
  The three city leaders who signed the appeal believe that 
the 
aim pursued by the government -- to protect and support the 
domestic agricultural producers -- will not be achieved. They 
say that the domestic firms which supply food products to major 
cities are abruptly reducing their activity and all the major 
cities are already facing considerable shortages of the most 
important foodstuffs. 
  The appeal stresses that the food market in the major cities 
has dwindled dangerously, increasing the impoverishment of the 
people.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov report: "Viktor Chernomyrdin addressed the </F>
Federation Council. He Suggested to Deputies... Five Ways of 
Finding the Trillions"] 
  [Text] Unfortunately the grotesque word "nonpayments" has 
now become firmly established in the vocabulary not just of 
economic managers but of Joe Public too and has afflicted all 
spheres of the economy like a cancerous growth. In his speech 
to the Federation Council session, Viktor Chernomyrdin cited the 
following figures: As of 1 March, the debt owed to enterprises 
was 25 trillion rubles [R] whereas the debt owed by them was R32 
trillion. This means that there are R7 trillion missing from 
the equation: Even with mutual offsetting of debts throughout 
all production chains and all types of economic ties, there 
would still be a colossal amount owed -- many consumers will not 
have the actual resources with which to settle their debts. 
  I think that, in these extremely difficult conditions, 
Viktor 
Chernomyrdin has offered some quite effective methods of 
overcoming the crisis. 
  Method one. Clear the budget debt to enterprises (R4.6 
trillion). The method: direct payments, the issue of 
promissory notes (over R1 trillion), and the reduction of taxes 
on enterprises equivalent to the amount owed. 
  Method two. The granting of centralized credits to end 
consumers to facilitate targeted payment for supplies along the 
entire production chain. 
  Method three. The introduction into circulation of 
commercial promissory notes, which would signify a property 
liability for financial commitments assumed. 
  Method four. A rigorous procedure for bankrupting 
enterprises which are not viable, are merely a drain on 
financial resources, and do not yield a return. 
  Method five. Rigid taxation discipline, which ensures that 
the revenue sections of the budget are properly topped up. 
  So, it seems, the premier's team has finally rolled up its 
sleeves. There is just one question here: Why has it taken so 
long? Let us recall that back on 23 February our newspaper 
published an extract from a memorandum of the Russian Federation 
President's Analytical Center dedicated to the problem of 
nonpayments. The center's recommendations are very close to the 
premier's proposals. Furthermore, in our view they include a 
number of additional measures not yet taken into account which 
would make it possible in principle to prevent similar crises in 
the future. Once again there is cause to blame the extremely 
complex social and political situation in the country, which is 
diverting the government from the solution of the most urgent 
problems.

  [Text] Magnitogorsk March 18 TASS -- "The present system of 
taxing enterprises when taxes sometimes total 80 per cent of 
revenues, must be changed," Russian First Vice-Premier Oleg 
Soskovets told journalists on Friday after a conference on how 
to make the Magnitogorsk iron and steel combine a joint stock 
society. 
  According to Soskovets, taxes should be cut down to 45 per 
cent, as is the case in civilised countries. "Tax legislation 
should stimulate production and not to pave grounds for 
concealing taxes, as is the case now," the vice-premier stressed. 
  Soskovets noted that the government plans to examine the 
question of cutting the value-added tax in the near future. He 
stressed that it is necessary to "lift customs duties from goods 
crossing borders inside the Commonwealth countries".

<F P=106> [Valeriy Batuyev report under the "Reformers" rubric: </F>
"Aleksandr Shokhin Promises To Amend Laws "To Resolve Emergency 
Situation in the Economy"] 
  [Text] Despite the fact that Russian enterprises have more 
than $90 billion in foreign bank accounts "they are in no hurry 
to settle with the suppliers," Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin 
stated off the record to a group of journalists at the Federal 
Assembly. Besides, he said, tax inspections do not keep tabs on 
incomes of enterprises although there exist in every state rules 
formulated through long experience under which enterprises 
volunteer to pay taxes toward the budget. Such a rule, Mr. 
Shokhin thinks, should also operate in relations between 
components of the Russian Federation. Said the vice premier: 
"Therefore we are to amend the legislative acts (laws on banks, 
enterprises, entrepreneurial activities, and the tax system) in 
the near future so as to quickly introduce these mechanisms of 
controlling a market-based economy. 
  To the question from your SEGODNYA correspondent on how this 
can be done quickly, Aleksandr Shokhin made it understood that 
this does not mean introducing a command system: There is "an 
element of emergency, but it is not an emergency in the 
political sense of the word. This is a normal system for 
control of a market-based economy, ...an emergency action is 
warranted by the current situation in the economy and by the 
fact that the 1994 draft budget forwarded by the government to 
the Federal Assembly can be turned down." Therefore Mr. Shokhin 
is inclined to think of the need for a collective approach to 
bringing the country out of the economic crisis. The vice 
premier proposed to create for this purpose a "roundtable" 
bringing together the Russian Federation Government, the State 
Duma, the Federation Council, and public organizations. He also 
thought that there should be some corrections made: "Is it 
worthwhile for us to hasten with privatizing Gazprom-type state 
enterprises and oil enterprises, using vouchers. It may be 
better to spare them for a privatization stage where cash is 
involved." 
  Aleksandr Shokhin thinks that Russia will not be able to 
bring down inflation and stop the continuing production slump 
without such a package of measures.

<F P=106> [Andrey Nikolayev report under the "Threat" rubric: </F>
"Russian Atomic Electric Power Stations `On the Verge of 
Shutdown.' Workers of Atomic Stations in Kursk Continue Hunger 
Strike"] 
  [Text] Leaders of the Central Committee of the 
Atomenergoprom trade union, "Electroprofsoyuz," as well as 
chiefs of the "Rosenergoatom" concern told journalists in a 
press conference in Moscow yesterday that a dangerous situation 
has currently taken shape at virtually all nuclear stations of 
Russia which carries "a real threat to the country's security 
and, unless urgent measures are taken, may result in emergency 
situations in the regions entailing grave social and ecological 
consequences." According to Vladimir Kashkin, deputy chairman 
of the Central Committee of the Atomenergomash trade union, the 
situation results from nonpayments and the lowering of the rate 
of payment for electric power on the part of the "Single Power 
Supply System of Russia" joint-stock company. Owing to the 
absence of monetary funds, atomic electric power stations [AES] 
could not buy nuclear fuel and did not carry out in good time 
the scheduled repairs, reconditioning, maintenance, and 
reconstruction. The remaining stock of nuclear fuel at most 
AES's around Russia is enough for them to operate at nominal 
capacity for not longer than one month. Specialists think that 
a forced shutdown of AES generators would result in nuclear 
stations' becoming, instead of producers, major consumers of 
electric power to remove residual energy from nuclear fuel, and 
would serve only as storages for highly radioactive materials. 
  Vladimir Kashkin also stated that an extremely tense 
situation has taken shape in the collectives of nuclear 
stations, including nuclear safety personnel, over delayed 
wages. Mass protest actions against the government's economic 
policy have already begun. For example, five workers of the 
Kursk AES continue their hunger strike announced on 11 March. 
According to Kursk AES director Vladimir Gusarov, the strikers 
demand that debts for the already supplied electricity be 
settled, and that wages for December, January, and February be 
paid. They also insist on meeting with Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin to prevent a social explosion in work collectives. 
  The press conference organizers announced that owing to 
explosive developments, the coordination committee on joint 
actions, set up three days ago at a joint conference of 
Atomenergoprom and "Elektroprofsoyuz" trade unions 
representatives, forwarded yesterday an appeal to the Russian 
president, prime minister, and chairmen of the Federal Assembly 
chambers. It says that "the work collectives' patience is not 
limitless." It also contains a demand for an urgent discussion 
in the government of issues connected with ending the crisis in 
power engineering, and for the passing of Russian Federation 
laws "On Atomic Energy" and "On Electric Power Engineering." 
  [Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 0400 GMT on 19 
March adds, in a report from Murmansk: "The Kola nuclear power 
station has four power units. Two of them have already been 
closed down. The planned close-down of the third power unit is 
scheduled for 22 March. Naturally, such a sharp reduction of 
power supply to enterprises in the oblast will immediately 
affect the economic situation in the region, because the nuclear 
power station provides 60 percent of all the electricity 
produced in the Kola Peninsula. The Murmansk Oblast enterprises 
will certainly feel the power shortage, but first of all the 
supply of power will be stopped to neighboring Karelia and 
Leningrad Oblast. The nuclear power station has no guarantee 
that the fourth power unit will not be closed down as well."]

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has denied 
reports of future cuts in antiaircraft defense troops. Instead, 
in conversation with journalists he said that the military 
department has examined the issue of the expediency of 
continuing to preserve the present antiaircraft defense 
structure. In Grachev's opinion, under current conditions there 
is no need for antiaircraft defense forces to cover all sites. 
Therefore a decision has been taken on protecting only main 
sites, in particular nuclear and hydroelectric power stations, 
defense industry factories, and state institutions throughout 
Russia. Grachev also reported that the military department 
intends to get rid of antiquated antiaircraft defense systems.

  [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- "The creation of the 
"Rossvooruzhenie" corporation is another step taken by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin with the aim of fostering the Russian 
statehood and Russia's position in the world community" said 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on Friday night, 
addressing the ceremony of the inauguration of a new state 
corporation "Rossvooruzhenie" for exports and imports of weapons. 
  The corporation was established in accordance with the 
Russian president's decree and on the basis of three former 
foreign trade associations. The task of the newly established 
corporation is to ensure state monopoly over exports and imports 
of weapons and defence hardware for the development of military 
and technical cooperation with foreign countries. 
  Kozyrev pointed out that the development of military 
cooperation with foreign countries promotes the growth of 
Russian industry, creation of work places and higher industrial 
output. At the same time, the development of such cooperation 
is a tangible contribution to strengthening peace and stability 
both in the world and in separate regions. 
  Any country which supports and develops such cooperation 
with 
Russia, can count on Russia's diplomatic support. At the same 
time, by developing such cooperation, we expect an adequate 
attitude from our foreign partners and honest attitude in trade, 
the Russian minister said. 
  Weapons as an item for exports cannot be regarded as a 
conventional commodity, and therefore, Russia seeks to give 
weapons trade a civilized character. "We shall see to it that 
weapons do not spread over the world, and primarily, its most 
destabilizing specimen and weapons of mass destruction," the 
Russian foreign minister said.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Gromak report: "Amber Coast Is Special Russian </F>
Defense Region. Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation 
Defense Minister, Tours Kaliningrad Oblast"] 
  [Text] Pavel Grachev arrived in Kaliningrad on the 
afternoon of 17 March and was "besieged" by journalists as soon 
as he deplaned. Their interest was entirely understandable, 
despite the planned nature of the defense minister's trip. The 
naval force withdrawal from Poland and the Baltic countries, the 
fact that Kaliningrad Oblast is an enclave, and, finally, the 
concentration there of many Russian Federation Ground Force 
units withdrawn from abroad all ultimately determine the 
region's position from a specifically defense-based viewpoint. 
  Pavel Grachev described the aim of the trip as follows: 
  "First, it is necessary to look in detail at the state of 
Ground Force and Baltic Fleet subunits. Second, we must listen 
to the proposals from Admiral Yegorov, the fleet commander, and 
from Lieutenant General Anatoliy Pimenov, commander of the 11th 
Separate Combined-Arms Guards Army, for the rational deployment 
of troops and the creation in Kaliningrad Oblast of a special 
defensive region. 
  It needs to be stressed that work in this area has been 
under 
way previously. On the eve of the defense minister's visit to 
Kaliningrad Oblast representatives of the General Staff were 
already at work. On the eve of the defense minister's visit to 
Kaliningrad Oblast representatives of the General Staff were 
already at work. Army General Konstantin Kobets, chief military 
inspector and deputy defense minister, and the commanders in 
chief of the Russian Navy and Ground Forces have also been here 
to work out their own proposals. 
  Such close attention to the problems of the ground and naval 
forces deployed in Kaliningrad Oblast has given rise to various 
suggestions, including some very unlikely ones. For instance, 
certain analysts have proposed that Russia might give up the 
Baltic Fleet for purely economic reasons. 
  But Pavel Grachev stated at the airfield: "I want to see the 
fleet more combat capable than it is at present." He went on to 
note that the naval forces would most probably be based in both 
Leningrad and Kaliningrad Oblasts. And in the numbers necessary 
to safeguard security and ensure the reliable defense of our 
state. "The operational grouping that is being created here 
should ensure the defense of the territory from military threats 
not only from the sea, but from the land as well," Pavel Grachev 
said. 
  This was also discussed during the Russian Federation 
defense 
minister's meeting with garrison officers. Army Gen. Grachev 
also talked about the progress in reforming the Russian Armed 
Forces, noting the weighty contribution made by Kaliningrad 
Oblast to solving the problem of the drafting of young people to 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces. The draft plan has been 
more than 40 percent overfulfilled in this area. This is the 
best indicator of any region. 
  The defense minister paid particular attention to the 
condition of naval and Ground Forces units in Kaliningrad 
Oblast. By dint of its position the oblast has a special place 
within Russia. This makes increased demands on the system for 
the command and control of naval forces and Ground Forces units. 
  On the whole, the defense minister said, the forces of the 
Baltic Fleet and the 11th Army are carrying out the tasks they 
have been set. But even higher results are expected during 
these checks. 
  The defense minister briefed those present on what is 
currently being done in the Russian Armed Forces and talked 
about certain results of the start of the new training year. 
Army Gen. Pavel Grachev stressed that main efforts have been 
focused on the practical implementation of the plan for the 
Armed Forces' organizational development, the creation of force 
groupings -- above all, mobile force groupings -- the 
enhancement of the command and control system, the search for a 
fundamentally new approach toward Armed Forces utilization, and 
the improvement of the organizational and personnel structure. 
But the main task for the Russian Armed Forces in 1994 is to 
maintain their combat readiness and combat capability at a level 
that ensures that the state is defended under any circumstances, 
and to carry out the tasks laid down by the main provisions of 
Russia's military doctrine. 
  In the first two and a half months of 1994, the defense 
minister said, the plans for troop and naval force training have 
been carried out. Two command post training sessions have been 
held at the strategic level and more than 10 at the 
operational-tactical level. It is planned to hold another 
training session before the end of the training year on the 
command and control of Strategic Nuclear Forces, and the "South 
'94" command post exercise. It is planned to hold the 
"Northwest," "Baykal," and "Vostok" regional command post 
exercises and the "West" operational rear services command post 
exercise. This, in Army Gen. Grachev's words, will make it 
possible to prevent any decline in the level of combat readiness. 
  The defense minister's order on the early promotion of a 
number of the most outstanding Army and Navy officers was read 
out at a meeting at the garrison Officers House and valuable 
gifts were presented. A brigade of artistes under the 
leadership of Iosif Kobzon gave a concert. 
  The same day Army Gen. Pavel Grachev heard reports from Adm. 
Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet, and Lt. Gen. Pimenov, 
commander of the 11th Army. That night the naval forces were 
rallied upon the signal to assemble. 
  On Friday the defense minister visited the fleet's alternate 
command post, attended a naval infantry brigade tactical 
exercise, and met with the crew of the destroyer Nastoychivyy.

  [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- Preliminary results of a 
regular stage of local elections to representative bodies, held 
on March 20 in some regions of Russia, were made public today. 
According to the Central Electoral Commission, elections were 
scheduled for that day in the Belgorod, Vologda, Kamchatka, 
Kirov, Leningrad, Murmansk, Omsk, Orenburg, Oryol, Perm, 
Smolensk, Tver and Chita regions, the city of St. Petersburg and 
three autonomous districts -- the Aga- Buryat, the Komi-Perm and 
the Nenets districts. 
  Elections to the supreme representative body of the 
Aga-Buryat Autonomous District, the district duma, have taken 
place. Residents of that steppe area showed a traditionally 
high activity: some 60 per cent of electors came to the polling 
stations. The elections were recognised as valid in all the 15 
constituencies. The district duma will be made up mostly of 
heads of regional organisations, agricultural amalgamations and 
industrial enterprises. 
  At the same time, the activity of electors in the Chita 
region was unprecedentedly low. According to preliminary data, 
a little more than 30 per cent of electors took part in the 
voting. An electoral campaign and elections will have to be 
repeated in five out of 21 constituencies, a spokesman for the 
regional electoral commission told ITAR-TASS. 
  Candidates, nominated or supported by the democratic forces 
of the Baykal territory, suffered a serious defeat in the Chita 
region. Most seats in the regional parliament went to heads of 
industrial enterprises, farms and budget-financed institutions. 
  The legislative assembly of the Orenburg region will not be 
able to start working. Protocols from local electoral 
commissions are still coming, but it is known already that the 
elections were not recognised as valid in 19 out of 47 
constituencies: 12 -- in Orenburg, six -- in Orsk and one in 
Novotroitsk. Repeated elections will be held in three months in 
those constituencies, where electors did not come to the polling 
stations. According to the information, received by ITAR-TASS 
at the regional electoral commission, the elections were a 
complete failure in the city of Orenburg, which includes 13 
constituencies. Only one deputy was elected, while in the rest 
of the constituencies the elections were recognised as invalid, 
because too few people took part in the voting. 
  Kamchatka residents also failed to elect deputies to the 
regional legislative assembly with the first attempt. Elections 
were recognised as valid in five out of eight constituencies, 
while in three biggest four-seat constituencies, located on the 
territory of the administrative centre of the region, only 17 
per cent of electors came to the polling stations. Thus, only 
nine out of 21 deputies were elected, a spokesman for the 
regional electoral commission told ITAR-TASS. According to his 
information, elections to the city dumas were valid in Yelizovo 
and Vilyuchinsk, while Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy was left 
without a representative body. A referendum on giving new names 
to the streets and moving monuments to Lenin to other places did 
not take place either. Today the regional electoral commission 
is expected to name the date of repeated elections to the 
legislative assembly. 
  The regional assembly of people's representatives has been 
formed in the Belgorod region. The March 20 elections showed a 
comparatively high activity of electors: some 44 per cent of 
them came to the polling stations. However, the figures differ 
much in various constituencies. In rural areas the figure was 
55 per cent, while in Belgorod -- 24.3 per cent and in Stary 
Oskol -- 24.4 per cent. As a result of it, the elections were 
recognised as invalid in three out of five constituencies of 
Belgorod and in two out of three constituencies of Stary Oskol. 
The overall result is that the elections were held in 16 out of 
21 constituencies, and in all the 16 of them deputies to the 
regional assembly were elected. This is enough for the new 
representative authority to start working. About half of the 
seats went to heads and deputy heads of local city and district 
administrations. 
  Elections in the Perm region did take place, but only 34.4 
per cent of electors came to the polling stations. According to 
preliminary information, 37 deputies to the regional assembly 
were elected, while in three constituencies the elections were 
recognised as invalid because of a small number of participants. 
Two out of 14 seats in the Perm City Duma remained vacant. The 
Perm regional assembly will include nine representatives of 
business circles, ten senior executives of enterprises and seven 
heads or deputy heads of local administrations. 
  In the Kirov region 36 per cent of the electorate took part 
in elections to the regional duma and local government bodies. 
The elections were valid in 45 out of 48 constituencies. The 
regional duma will include 13 heads of agro-industrial 
enterprises, 11 heads of local administrations, nine medics, one 
workers. One woman was elected to the regional duma. 
  Elections were recognised as invalid in the Lenin and 
Oktyabrskiy districts of Kirov and in the city of 
Kirovo-Chepetsk, the second largest city of the region after the 
administrative centre. Only 25 per cent of electors came to the 
polling stations. 
  Elections to the regional duma were a complete failure in 
Murmansk. None of the three constituencies registered the 
needed number of electors. According to preliminary 
information, only 20.6 per cent of them took part in the voting 
in the Lenin district of the city. The figure for the 
Oktyabrskiy district is 19.6 per cent, and for the Pervomaiskiy 
district -- only 13.4 per cent. Information from other 
constituencies is being specified.

  [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy March 20 TASS -- The 
elections to local councils in the Kamchatka region may fail due 
to a low turnout of voters. According to the regional electoral 
commission, only 12.5 per cent of the electorate went to the 
polls by 15:00, local time, on Sunday (elections are considered 
to be carried out if at least 25 per cent of the electorate 
participates in them). 
  Only nine per cent of registered voters went to the polling 
stations in the regional centre where the bulk of voters live. 
  Taking into account that there is foul weather in 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (strong cold wind), the electoral 
commission granted a right to all the aged to vote at home where 
members of the electoral commission come with balloting paper 
boxes. The commission has not recorded for the time being any 
incidents or election violations. 
  Servicemen are voting at city polling stations for the first 
time (earlier, they voted at their units). Regrettably, many 
soldiers and sailors went to the city for a walk but do not go 
to polling stations. 
  Their argument is reasonable enough: It is difficult to make 
a choice right away if you arrived to serve on the Kamchatka 
Peninsula quite recently from another region. Besides, there 
was no time to follow the election campaign. 
  Orenburg -- a total of six per cent of registered voters 
went 
to the polls in the Orenburg region two hours after the opening 
of polling stations, and the figure stood at 15-21 per cent in 
the Sorochinskiy, Dombarovskiy, Krasnogvardeyskiy and 
Aleksandrovskiy districts. 
  Chairman of the regional electoral commission Yuriy Andreyev 
told ITAR-TASS that he is confident that "the elections to the 
regional legislature will be held in all 47 constituencies". 
  Chita -- the turnout at the elections to the Chita regional 
council is very low this Sunday. According to information 
received by 14:00, local time, voting is active only in several 
countryside districts where between 40 and 50 per cent of voters 
went to the polls. 
  Urban residents are in no hurry to vote. In Chita, for 
instance, only 15 per cent of the electorate participated in the 
polls by 14:00, while in the city of Krasnokamensk -- only 11 
per cent. 
  The situation is quite different in the Aginsky Buryat 
Autonomous Area which is also holding elections to the Chita 
regional and area councils. Over 40 per cent of voters went to 
the polls there by 14:00, local time. 
  Smolensk -- the lowest turnout at the local elections was 
registered in the regional centre by 10:00. The local 
administration spared no effort to open snack bars and to stage 
entertainment shows at polling stations. 
  This notwithstanding, voters are in no hurry to participate 
in voting. All in all, 820 polling stations opened in the 
Smolensk region on Sunday for the elections to the local council.

  [Text] Sergey Blinnikov, prime minister of Karelia, a 
constituent republic of the Russian Federation, has dropped out 
of the race for chairmanship of the parliament. The election is 
scheduled for April 17. He is expected to explain his decision 
to the Supreme Soviet's session to be held in Petrozavodsk 
Friday. 
  The incumbent Chairman Viktor Stepanov who is also running 
for this position told Interfax that he regretted what happened. 
He said that the interest of the electorate would not be met if 
there was no alternative candidate. He also said that he did 
not intend to quit the race and would not do so unless there 
were important personal reasons. He described his rival's 
decision as disrespectful of the electorate and thought that the 
opposition would say that there was no choice in the election. 
  Observers noted that while 5,000 signatures were needed to 
register a candidate in the election, Blinnikov's supporters had 
collected 6,000 while Stepanov's had a total of 15,500 
signatures.

  [Text] Saturday night the residence of Chechen President 
Dzokhar Dudayev came under fire. A spokesman for the law and 
order authorities has declined comment. Forces protecting the 
president's palace in Groznyy have, nonetheless, told an IF 
correspondent that around 22:00 a seeker head rocket was fired 
on the palace. There were no casualties, although several 9th 
story windows were broken and the roof's eaves suffered damage. 
Dudayev had by that time left the palace. 
  The republic's Security Department has opened a legal 
inquiry 
into what it sees as a terrorist act.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 19 Mar -- "The parliamentary hearings 
at the Federal Assembly and the closed session of the Federation 
Council are yet another attempt to settle relations between 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia by peaceful means, North Ossetian 
President Akhsarbek Galazov said today. 
  Speaking at a republican government session, members of the 
North Ossetian Supreme Soviet Presidium, and heads of local 
self-government bodies of Vladikavkaz and regions, he stressed 
that the Republic of North Ossetia was extremely interested in 
establishing normal relations with all its neighbors in North 
Caucasus and the Transcaucasus. However, the multi-ethnic 
people of the republic denounce the use of force in resolving 
these issues. The issue of refugee return to Prigorodnyy Rayon 
should not be forced either. This problem should be tackled by 
conciliatory commissions on the basis of the Kislovodsk 
Agreements. 
  The North Ossetian president reiterated his readiness to 
meet 
Ingush President Ruslan Aushev to discuss the settlement of 
relations between the peoples of the two republics. 
  Speaking about the position taken by the commission of 
deputies that worked in the state of emergency zone and who 
reported to the parliament on the results of its trip to North 
Caucasus, Akhsarbek Galazov said that it had gathered vast 
material but had made hasty and nonobjective conclusions which 
may cause the situation in the region to explode and may bring 
to naught all earlier peace-making efforts by the North Ossetian 
leadership and the interim administration. 
  He added that at the proposal of Russian Federation Council 
Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko, a special commission would be set up 
to draw up objective solutions aimed at settling the situation 
in the conflict zone.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz March 20 TASS -- "There is now a danger 
of a new conflict in the area said North Ossetian President 
Akhsarbek Galazov, speaking at a meeting with republican leaders 
here on Sunday. Therefore, it is expedient to prolong the state 
of emergency regime in several districts of the region, expiring 
on March 31. 
  "The Russian peace-keeping force is the main security 
guarantor in the region," the president claimed. 
  There are various opinions on the state of emergency regime 
in the North Ossetian official quarters and among multinational 
population of the republic, ranging from its repeal to 
preservation and extension, provided the temporary 
administration is transformed and functions of subordinated to 
it military units are changed. 
  This issue will be debated by the North Ossetian Parliament 
next week.

<F P=106> [Viktor Filippov report: "Court Has Ruled That Comparison </F>
With Fascists Does Not Insult Zhirinovskiy's Party"] 
  [Text] Vologda -- A comparison with fascists is not 
insulting to Zhirinovskiy's party. This conclusion follows from 
a ruling by Vologda City Court, which has considered an action 
against Yuriy Nekrasov, "Democratic Russia's" local leader, by 
the oblast organization of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia]. 
  Soon after the elections of 12 December last year Prof. 
Yuriy 
Nekrasov, Doctor of Historical Sciences, published in the 
newspaper RUSSKIY SEVER an article analyzing the reasons that 
led to the LDPR's sucess. A specialist in German history, he 
compared Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's actions with Adolf Hitler's in 
the Reichstag elections of January 1933 and called the LDPR a 
profascist political organization. 
  Vologda Liberal Democrats took out a court action to defend 
their honor and dignity. They demanded a public apology from 
Yuriy Nekrasov, as well as a sum of 10 million rubles for the 
moral harm. Sergey Mormin, coordinator of the LDPR's oblast 
organization, explained in court that they need this money for 
propaganda work to restore the party's undermined prestige. 
Some 29 percent of the voters who went to the ballot boxes 
voted for Zhirinovskiy's party in the 12 December elections in 
Vologda Oblast. But the Liberal Democrats have been unable to 
field a single candidate for the elections to the oblast duma to 
be held 20 March. 
  "More than two-thirds of the citizens who supported us in 
the 
last elections," Sergey Mormin explained, "have refused to sign 
documents in favor of our candidates, saying that we are a 
fascist party." 
  In the court session Prof. Yuriy Nekrasov, relying on works 
by U.S. and Italian researchers into fascism, named six generic 
signs of this political trend and illustrated them convincingly 
with quotations from Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's book and speeches. 
Evidently finding nothing with which to counter the professor's 
arguments, Sergey Mormin, the Vologda Liberal Democrats' leader, 
disowned his own leader, telling the court that Zhirinovskiy's 
actions are a personal matter for Zhirinovskiy and have no 
bearing on the activity of the whole party. 
  After an investigation lasting more than three hours the 
court rejected the Vologda LDPR organization's action against 
Prof. Yuriy Nekrasov, chairman of "Democratic Russia's" oblast 
branch.

<F P=106> [Sergey Krayukhin report: "Over 300 City Hall Officials </F>
Lose Cushy Jobs"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- A few hours before a press 
conference in the Smolnyy, Anatoliy Sobchak signed a directive 
on the formation of the St. Petersburg government. 
  The subject of the reorganization of the city's executive 
branch was one of the main subjects in a conversation between 
the mayor and journalists. Sobchak reported the upcoming 
considerable reduction in the army of city hall officials which, 
according to him, was dictated by the low work efficiency of a 
number of committees, the duplication of their functions, and 
excessive red tape in solving what are sometimes the most 
elementary questions. The financial and economic committees will 
merge, the size of the committee for the administration of city 
property will be considerably reduced, and the total number of 
officials threatened with dismissal will reach 340. 
  The mayor believes that existing privatization legislation 
facilitates corruption and the transfer of considerable material 
assets into the hands of mafia-type operators. This is why, 
Sobchak said, he will make every effort to delay the process of 
floating enterprises in Petersburg until parliament adopts 
civilized laws. 
  Forecasting the composition of the future city assembly, the 
mayor stressed that he is alarmed by the nomination for deputy 
of people guilty of sharp practice, forgery, bribery, and other 
criminal activity and who are now under investigation. 
Petersburgers, he said, must show their characteristic common 
sense and vigilance when they put their voting papers into the 
ballot box. 
  Answering a question about the possibility that Arkadiy 
Kramarev, chief of the Petersburg and Oblast Internal Affairs 
Main Administration, will be removed from his post, Sobchak 
confirmed that these rumors are groundless. Although it is not 
for him but the Ministry of Internal Affairs to assess the 
general's activity, the mayor holds the Internal Affairs Main 
Administration leadership directly responsible for the extremely 
unfavorable crime situation in the city. 
  The journalists were among the first to learn first-hand 
from 
the mayor that the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development has agreed to invest in the construction of a new 
airport on the banks of the Neva whose cost is estimated at $75 
million. This bank intends to make a considerable investment in 
the reconstruction of St. Petersburg's historic center. 
  One of the main events in Petersburg's life in the near 
future will be an international banking congress, which will be 
unprecedented in the country's entire history in terms of the 
composition and number of participants. It will bring together 
around 4,000 bankers and dozens of the biggest Russian and world 
banks on the banks of the Neva and will last 10 days. 
  But the main event of the coming summer will undoubtedly be 
the Goodwill Games. The reconstruction of sports facilities, 
the mayor assured, is being carried out according to schedule 
and will be completed on time. As of today 2,000 of the world's 
leading sportsmen have sent in their applications to participate 
in the Goodwill Games-94.

  [Text] Mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak has 
extended the elections to the City Assembly, held on March 20, 
by another 24 hours. 
  Sobchak did so just 90 minutes before voting was to end, 
when 
it became clear that the elections were a failure. According to 
the city electoral commission, only 21.532000060100f the electors came 
to the polling stations (elections will be considered valid if 
252000060100f the electors take part in voting). 
  The electoral commission believes that a second round of 
elections must be held. As each seat in the City Assembly is 
contested by about 15 candidates, it is unlikely that any of 
them will accrue the required 5010006040lus 1 vote. 
  Sobchak has made an amendment in the provision on elections 
according to which a candidate shall be considered elected 
during the first round if he receives a majority of the votes 
irrespective of the number of voters.

  [Text] The Estonian Foreign Ministry has welcomed the 
treaty initialled at the last round of Russian-Latvian talks on 
the withdrawal of Russian Armed Forces from Latvia, which 
stipulates that the troops must be withdrawn by 31 August this 
year. The Estonian Foreign Ministry also expresses the hope 
that on the basis of the proposal made by the Russian prime 
minister to withdraw troops from Estonia by 31 August, and on 
the attitude of the international community that no additional 
conditions may be attached to the withdrawal, Russia will be 
ready to initial the treaty on the withdrawal of the troops at

Affairs in Tallinn: "Estonian-Russian Agreement Ready To Be 
Initialled in April in Moscow"] 
  [Text] March 18, 1994 -- The initialing of the agreement 
for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia by August 31, 
1994 is viewed as a positive development by the Estonian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  It is important to note that the agreement for the complete 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia is also ready to be 
initialled. Estonia had hoped that this could have been done at 
the last round of talks, but instead the Russian side presented 
new demands and even placed the mutually agreed upon withdrawal 
date of August 31, 1994 into question. 
  In light of the Russian Prime Minister's recent stated 
agreement to remove Russian troops from Estonia by August 31, 
1994 and the international consensus that the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Estonia can not be tied to any conditions, 
the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes that Russia will 
initial the agreement to withdraw troops from Estonia during the 
18th round of negotiations April 5-6 in Moscow. 
  By completing the removal of its troops from all three 
Baltic 
States by August 31, 1994, Russia will finally be in conformance 
with paragraph 15 of the 1992 Helsinki document, which requires 
"early, orderly and complete" withdrawal.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 18, BNS - The hope that Russia will 
hand over to Estonia a timetable for pulling its troops out from 
the country is getting smaller and smaller, said Vaino Reinart, 
Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks with Russia. 
  Reinart said Estonia is currently working on new wordings 
for 
the texts of the draft treaties, which he said now "hopefully 
are also acceptable to the Russian side." 
  He expressed hope that progress will be made at the next 
round of the talks, due to start on Apr. 5, also over the troop 
withdrawal agreement. "This agreement was ready already once, 
but because of the proposed amendments from the Russian side 
some disputed wordings have come up," the head of the Estonian 
delegation said. 
  Commenting on Russia's demands that the troop withdrawal 
agreement must be signed together with an agreement on social 
guarantees for the retired Russian military in Estonia, Reinart 
said differences in opinions of the two parties still remained 
over the latter. 
  "The greatest difference is that the Russian side would like 
to set forth in the agreement the circle of the retired military 
who are entitled to apply for a residence permit in Estonia. 
Estonia's position, however, is that the agreement is not meant 
to determine the circle of the retired military, but will 
establish regulations on how the retired military would get 
their pensions from Russia and how they will pay for medical 
services," Reinart said. 
  The second major difference is over granting the retired 
military the right to privatize their flats for vouchers. 
Reinart said Russia wants that Estonia delivered to the retired 
military its privatization vouchers for the time of their 
service in the armed forces. 
  "Since Estonia doesn't give the vouchers even to Estonian 
citizens for the years of service in the Russian army, this 
means that the Russian side wants to have for the retired 
Russian military a little more rights than the Estonian citizens 
are having," Reinart explained. 
  The head of the Russian delegation for the talks, Vasiliy 
Svirin, has said Russia will continue discussing the issue of 
social guarantees for its retired military at the talks with 
Estonia. 
  The 18th round of the talks will be held on Apr. 5-6 near 
Moscow. Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar has said Estonia plans 
no changes in its delegation and will continue with its present 
team.

  [Excerpts] President Lennart Meri highly rated his visits 
to Israel and Ukraine; they were also productive. [passage 
omitted] Foreign Minister Juri Luik provided a survey of the 
agreements concluded. 
  [Begin Luik recording] With Israel we signed an agreement on 
the protection of investments. Now that there is quite 
substantial economic interest in Estonia on the part of Israeli 
businessmen this will definitely liven any business dealings and 
provide some kind of security and guarantees. 
  With Ukraine we signed agreements on developing scientific 
and cultural links and on visa-free travel for the holders of 
diplomatic passports. (?Travel on diplomatic passports does 
not, of course, amount to much) but it displays the first signs 
of goodwill, all the same. Serious agreements are probably to 
follow after a while. The most serious agreement will evidently 
be the one on free trade between the two countries. Estonian 
businessmen find it impossible to transport many goods, with the 
customs duty at 30 percent, which is definitely too much, so 
talks were held in this respect. We also have Peeter Tohver, 
the Economics Ministry's deputy chancellor with us. Evidently, 
an agreement on transit transport will also be completed in the 
near future. It will enable Ukraine to use Estonian ports as 
well as us using the services of Black Sea ports, should the 
need arise. So, I believe that trade and business relations 
between the two countries received quite a substantial boost 
[words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] This afternoon the Latvian President Guntis 
Ulmanis and representatives of the government cabinet returned 
to Riga from Italy, having discussed on their two-day official 
visit future co-operation between the two countries. From Riga 
airport, where a news conference took place, our correspondent 
Ainars Asaks has returned. Let's listen to the president's 
brief assessment of the visit. 
  [Begin Ulmanis recording] This was my first visit this year 
outside the country's borders, and I regard the visit as 
successful. We are satisfied with the results of our work. For 
two days we were in two states: Italy and the Vatican. The 
first purpose of this visit was to create mutual understanding 
between Italy and Latvia, the Vatican and Latvia. In the two 
days we met both the Italian president and the foreign minister 
and Foreign Ministry representatives. On the second day there 
was to my mind a very important reception at the Vatican. With 
great sympathy, with great support, the Pope very attentively 
listened to the problems that are current in Latvia. The 
parties to the talks (?assessed) Latvian- Russian relations. 
Although the Pope did not promise anything, nevertheless, I 
understand from what he said that he regards Latvia and the 
Baltic lands as very important geopolitically for the 
development of this region, which could be a golden key in the 
formation of relations between East and West. [end recording] 
  After the withdrawal of the Russian troops, Italian-Latvian 
relations will become more stable, emphasized Foreign Minister 
Georgs Andrejevs at the news conference. 
  [Begin Andrejevs recording] On questions of a general 
nature, 
there was of course interest in how Italian-Latvian relations 
could develop in the future. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The next stop on the Estonian president's tour 
after Israel was Ukraine, where Yuriy Olenenko, Ukrainian 
ambassador to Estonia, accompanied the Estonian delegation. 
Here is what he thought of the visit. 
  [Begin Olenenko recording in Russian fading into 
superimposed 
report in Estonian] The ambassador regards the fact that the 
meeting took place as well as its outcome as something very 
important. He is convinced that it will pave the way toward a 
strengthening of political, economic, and cultural relations 
between Estonia and Ukraine. The ambassador emphasized that the 
Ukrainian leadership and President Kravchuk will rate the visit 
and the agreements achieved very highly. The agreements allow 
for relations between our countries to develop further by using 
every opportunity to this end. 
  Ukraine and Estonia see each other as equal partners. They 
do not set any conditions on each other. Instead, they aim for 
relations between our states to serve as a model for Europe, to 
serve as a guarantor for stability. [passage omitted] (end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] I will remind you here once again what Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk said at a press conference yesterday: 
There is no Russian-speaking population; there are only 
nationalities, the Russians, Ukrainians, Estonians. Why should 
a person who speaks Russian have immediate protection because of 
this fact?

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 19, BNS -- A work group set up to make 
preparations for Estonia's possible membership in the European 
Union [EU] met in Tallinn Friday [18 March] to draw up a 
tentative timetable for discussion of the outcome of panel 
meetings under the group. 
  Each of the different panels under the work group has to 
present by March 31 a report on the predicted changes that may 
take place in connection with the country's joining the EU, a 
representative at the Foreign Ministry press office said. 
  The meetings are to estimate whether the predicted changes 
will be in line with Estonia's current principles and directions 
of development. Also to be assessed is the volume of work to be 
done in preparing for the membership, its costs, and how to get 
experts from different fields involved in the project.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 18, BNS -- The head of the Estonian 
delegation for talks with Russia, Vaino Reinart, returned from 
Brussels today where he held consultations with representatives 
of the European Union on preparations for the European stability 
pact. 
  The European stability pact above all concerns the nine 
central European nations that are regarded as potential future 
members of the European Union, Reinart said. He added that the 
pact would facilitate and pave way for these countries' becoming 
EU members. 
  The main emphasis in the pact is laid on resolving all kinds 
of border disputes and ethnic minority issues, he said. Reinart 
said that EU officials dealing with the European stability pact 
were having it clear that no minority problems existed in 
Estonia and that the issues was about "integrating the citizens 
of other countries into the Estonian society."

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 18, BNS -- The Russian embassy in 
Tallinn says it is unnecessary to publicly respond to anonymous 
charges of spying moved against Anatoliy Chizhikov, a counsellor 
at the embassy. 
  "We do not consider it necessary to publicly respond to such 
provocative actions by anonymous authors. But speaking about 
the Russian diplomat concerned, he received the agreement from 
the Estonian government for being accredited in the Republic of 
Estonia in his capacity as military, air force and naval attache 
with the Russian embassy in Tallinn," said Andrey Yakushev, 
press attache at the embassy. 
  Estonia's Eesti Aeg weekly newspaper in its Wednesday's [16 
March] edition published an unsigned paper saying that Anatoliy 
Chizhikov is the "chief Russian spy in Estonia." Anonymous 
authors of the note claim the diplomat "coordinates the activity 
of the Russian spying center operating in Estonia," as well as 
of a "special intelligence group" which includes employees from 
the Estonian Defense Ministry, the Central Staff, the Interior 
and Foreign ministries, as well as other government departments.

Estonian border guards began partially controlling the aircraft 
landing at and taking off from Amari Airfield, which is under 
Russian military control. Laar stated that the export of goods 
and illegal border crossings via Amari are no longer possible 
because Russian servicemen must first obtain permission from the 
Estonian Defense Ministry for flights. He rejected claims that 
criminal forces are using Amari to export cars. According to 
information available to Laar, five Russian military transport 
planes have landed and taken off at Amari during the first 
months of the year, having been first cleared by the Estonian 
border guards. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 19, BNS -- Ending the transmission of 
broadcasts of the Ostankino TV channel in Estonia would create 
an irreparable rift between Estonia's Russian-speaking 
population and the government, an appeal delivered to the 
government by the country's Russian Assembly says. 
  The Estonian Government ruled to cut back from March 11 the 
time that Ostankino broadcasts are available to viewers in 
Estonia, after the Moscow television company failed to pay for 
the transmission of its program on Estonia's national network. 
The government ruling says the broadcasts will be cut off 
completely from March 28 if Ostankino by that date has not 
signed a new agreement with the Estonian Telecommunications 
Company or has paid its debts for the last months. 
  The step would negatively affect the Russian-speakers' 
loyalty to the Estonia Government, Estonia's Russian Assembly 
says. The document also says that the assembly has already 
called on the respective Russian institutions to resolve the 
financial problems connected with the transmission of Ostankino 
broadcasts. 
  The assembly suggests that the Ostankino program be 
transmitted in Estonia via a cable network. The representative 
body says a respective agreement together with a financing 
project should be signed at the level of the two countries' 
governments. 
  Ostankino owes to the Estonian company about 105,000 German 
marks for the transmission of its broadcasts in 1993, plus some 
80,000 German marks for January.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, Mar 18, BNS -- Estonian Defense Police 
Chief Juri Pihl said that the representative of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia, Pyotr Rozhok, needs to be 
examined by a psychiatrist. 
  Pihl's remarks followed after his department on Wednesday 
[16 
March] formally brought charges against Rozhok. 
  "If a person doesn't go there (to a psychiatrist) by his own 
will, bringing under compulsion must be implemented. The same 
will be done if Rozhok won't appear before investigators. 
Everything will be done according to the laws and Rozhok has 
the possibility to take a lawyer," Pihl said. 
  The representative of Russian radical nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's misleadingly-named Liberal Democratic 
Party in his speech in Narva on Jan. 25 and in an interview with 
the Russian-language SILLAMAESKI VESTNIK local newspaper of the 
northeast Estonian town of Sillamae "fanned inter-ethnic and 
political hostility," the indictment says. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Monday, March 21 -- The government intends to start 
registering residents of Paldiski by the end of March. The 
residents are to fill in special questionnaires and have their 
passports stamped. The move was made necessary by the refusal 
of the Russian military authorities to hand over the militia 
registration files. The registration is to concern the Russian 
military as well. 
  The joint Estonian-Russian staff exercise concerned the 
evacuation of the nuclear fuel from Paldiski and also studied 
the "black scenario" connected with possible escape of 
radioactive material. The Estonian side has agreed that 200 
additional Russian experts with equipment be allowed to arrive 
in case of emergency.

  [Text] The Estonian Cabinet approved March 17 a bill on 
increasing the fuel excise tax rates up to two times from the 
present. The draft now enters the parliament. 
  The draft legislation proposes raising the excise tax on 
gasoline from the present 0.40 kroons per liter to 0.80 kroons 
for ordinary gasoline, and to 0.60 kroons for gasoline 
containing less than 0.013 grams of lead per liter. 
  Introduction of different rates is aimed at encouraging car 
owners to use fuel less detrimental to the environment. 
  The excise tax on diesel fuel is to be hiked from the 
current 
0.25 kroons to 0.50 kroons per liter. Rates for aircraft fuel, 
liquid gas and lubricants are to remain the same. 
  The government has said the step is mainly due to the need 
to 
earn an estimated additional 21.8 million kroons into the state 
coffers to pay higher pensions from April. 
  A representative at the Finance Ministry said the Estonian 
Oil Association, a body connecting the country's fuel companies, 
had agreed to the motion. 
  The Oil Association's managing director, Mart Kutsar, told 
BNS his association had not approved of the planned step. But 
he also said in an interview with the ARIPAEV business newspaper 
that despite not approving of the step the association still 
understood that the hike was inevitable.

of the Russian Army, adding that it awaits the ratification of 
the treaty by the two countries' parliaments. Sweden, Finland, 
and Poland expressed approval of what has been achieved, and

important to the U.S. Government.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 19, BNS -- French Ambassador Jean 
Debenest at a meeting with Latvia's Minister of Justice Egils 
Levits in Riga on Friday [18 March] welcomed the initialing of a 
troop withdrawal treaty between Latvia and Russia. She said the 
treaty was a diplomatic success that greatly contributed to 
enhancing the security of the Baltics, the Ministry of Justice 
press office reports. 
  The Latvian minister told the French ambassador that his 
country will take into account the suggestions by the Council of 
Europe experts when taking its citizenship bill for the second 
reading in the parliament. 
  The ambassador said the public in Latvia needed to be 
explained that passing the bill in the suggested wording would 
open doors to Latvia for speedier integration with Europe. This 
also means that in the future the nation's security and welfare 
would increase and additional finances will come into the 
country, the French ambassador said. 
  Debenest also said that a former minister of justice, at 
present the head of the French Constitutional Court, will visit 
Latvia next week. One of the issues the head of the French 
Constitutional Court wants to learn more closely about is the 
current situation over adopting the Latvian citizenship law.

<F P=106> [From the "Review of Latvian Press"] </F>
  [Text] Riga, March 18 (LETA) -- Latvian press of today is 
publishing an extensive coverage of the texts of Latvian-Russian 
agreements initialed in Moscow earlier this week. The daily 
DIENA cites the opinion expressed on the matter by Aleksandrs 
Kirsteins, head of the parliamentarian Foreign Committee, who 
claims that there were numerous discrepancies between the 
documents which have been initialled by the two delegations, and 
the draft agreements which earlier have been presented for a 
closer examination of members of parliament. The rights to be 
granted to the retired Russian militaries under the agreements 
Kirsteins described as "anticonstitutional". He indicated that 
initialing of the package of the agreements was partly a result 
of pressure inflicted on Russia by the United States and the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE), while the 
government of the ruling parliamentarian faction "Latvijas Cels" 
("Latvian Way") "automatically puts its signature under all the 
demands put forward by Russia". The leader of the nationalist 
"Latvia's National Independence Movement" faction holds the view 
that those at least 70 thousand officers of the KGB secret 
police and commissioned officers of Russian Army which have come 
to Latvia en masse, notably in the past recent years after 
combat actions in so called "hot spots", are much more dangerous 
for Latvia than those several thousand Russian troops. 
Kirsteins underscores that the two parties have not reached any 
agreement which would provide for the future development of 
relations between Russia and Latvia for the next 20 years. The 
Latvian negotiators did not even raise the issue about Russia's 
recognizing occupation of Latvia, which had already been done in 
1991 by the then Supreme Council of the former Soviet Union. 
Kirsteins pointed out that the lack of agreements to this effect 
showed there were no basis laid out for guarantees providing a 
compensation to be paid for Latvia's property and for the Abrene 
region annexed by Russia. Meanwhile, Latvian Justice Minister 
Egils Levits said that the accord with Russia was "an important 
achievement of Latvian diplomats". The minister said he was 
certain that historians would evaluate the agreement as a 
successful move, citing the course of events with the pact of 
Latvia and Russia signed in 1920. 
  The package of initialled agreements between Russia and 
Latvia were needed by Latvian President in order to receive an 
entrance ticket to the St. George hall of the Kremlin, indicates 
an analyst with the Russian-language newspaper SM-SEGODNYA. The 
daily says that it was a high time for Latvian President to 
visit his Russian counterpart, otherwise his image of the 
popular figure and reconcilator can somewhat fade out, despite 
the urgent need for the liberals of the "Latvian Way" party to 
demonstrate clearly to the West, notably to the American 
friends, their good will towards normalization of relations with 
Russia. 
  The evening daily RIGAS BALSS has published a public opinion 
poll conducted among 1,000 residents of Latvia. The 
participants of the poll had to chose optional answers to the 
question whether performance of Saeima or parliament and that of 
the ministers cabinet of Latvia were in accordance with 
interests of the Latvian people. The option "fully corresponds" 
was chosen by 1.3 percent of people in relation to the 
parliament, and by 1.2 percent - in regard to the ministers 
cabinet. 15.2 percent of people said that activities of both 
parliament and government were "generally corresponding" to the 
interests of the Latvian people.

  [Text] Twenty-two Saeima deputies have sent an open letter 
to State President Guntis Ulmanis appealing to him not to sign 
the interstate agreements initialled at the talks between 
Latvian and Russian delegations, providing for the functioning 
in Latvia for another five-and-a-half years of the Russian 
Federation's military site, the Skrunda radar station. The 
letter says that the signing and ratification of such agreements 
would unequivocally signify Latvia's renunciation of the 
justified demands it has made so far for the speedy and complete 
withdrawal of Russia's armed forces, also incorporated in the 
resolutions of the United Nations Organization and the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The letter 
emphasizes that both the assembly of Latvian local authorities 
and many political and public organizations have testified to 
their unwillingness to legalize the activity of the Skrunda 
radar station on the territory of the Republic of Latvia, and 
demand the maintenance in force of Latvia's demand hitherto for 
the withdrawal of the occupying troops without additional 
conditions. 
  The deputies who signed the letter propose holding a 
referendum of Latvian citizens, simultaneously with the local 
government elections due on 29 May on their attitude to the 
operation of the Skrunda radar station in Latvia after 31 August 
this year, and call for the issue of concluding the treaty with 
Russia not to be debated before the collection of the referendum 
results. The letter is signed by 22 deputies of various 
factions in the Saeima, among them Maris Grinblats, the leader 
of For the Fatherland and Freedom; Aida Predele, the leader of 
the Christian Democrats; deputy Oskars Griks of the Peasants' 
Union; deputy Karlis Leiskalns of the Democratic Party; deputies 
Odisejs Kostanda, Eduards Berklavs, Aristids Lambergs, Andrejs 
Krastins of the Latvian National Independence Movement; and 
other deputies.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 18, BNS -- More than 40 searches were 
carried out throughout Vilnius Thursday [17 March] night in 
apartments of former and present Lithuanian Defense Ministry 
employees, including former Defense Minister Audrius 
Butkevicius, who currently studies in London. 
  In an interview on Lithuanian TV, Lithuanian Prosecutor 
General Arturas Paulauskas said the searches are related to the 
investigation of financial violations in the purchase of weapons 
for the Lithuanian army. The investigation was started in 
January. 
  Paulauskas declined to comment on the investigation but 
promised to inform about the results of the Thursday searches 
"in a matter of two days." 
  According to unofficial reports, the police arrested Vladas 
Laurinavicius, president of the Kaunas-based association Selma, 
which in 1992-1993 acted as a mediator in the purchase of 
weapons for Lithuanian defense forces. 
  The investigation established that the Lithuanian Defense 
Ministry paid unrealistic prices for automatic rifles, frigates 
and helicopters sold by Selma. Besides, the payments were made 
in cash, which is contrary to the law. Millions of then 
Lithuanian provisional money, also called talonas, and Russian 
rubles were paid personally to the association's president, who 
has several previous convictions and spent 5 years in jail. 
  Selma also builds housing for Russian servicemen withdrawing 
from the Baltic states. 
  Paulauskas said the unfavorable conditions for buying 
weapons 
at that time should be taken into account, but in his opinion, 
the financial violations cannot be ignored. He said "the 
investigation will establish whether (Defense Ministry) 
officials had any selfish incentives."

<F P=106> [Article by Audrius Lingys: "Armed and Extremely Dangerous" </F>
-- first paragraph is RESPUBLIKA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] The law "On Permit for Acquiring, Keeping, and 
Carrying of Firearms" comes into effect on 1 April. Under this 
law, Lithuanian citizens will be able to buy combat pistols or 
revolvers in stores. Last week, the government approved the 
rules for acquiring combat firearms. 
  Thus, you will be able to buy a combat firearm as of 1 
April. 
You will have to write an application to the interior minister 
explaining your motive and take it to a police station. You 
will have to attach a medical certification stating that your 
health condition allows you to keep a firearm. [passage omitted] 
  Following an inspection, the police station will have to 
pass 
your file over to the Interior Ministry within 20 days. You 
will not receive a permit if you were convicted for premeditated 
or casual crimes committed by using firearms, gas arms, or 
explosives, if you are on probation, or if you are undergoing a 
punishment other than imprisonment. 
  Nor will permits be issued to people who experienced 
administrative punishments for using or keeping drugs, for 
violating hunting and fishing rules, for keeping firearms and 
ammunition, and other offenses the nature of which suggests that 
firearms can be the instrument of a crime. 
  The Interior Ministry will not issue permits to incapable 
people, alcoholics and drug users, mentally affected persons, 
those who tried to commit suicides, as well as people with 
physical disabilities that could prevent the safe keeping and 
using of firearms. 
  Permits will not be issued to people who are on the 
preventive and operative register with the police, as well as to 
those who will not pass a theoretical and practical examination 
arranged by the police station. 
  If you have not violated the law, you will receive a permit 
to ACQUIRE firearms. The permit will be valid for six months, 
and you will have to buy a firearm within that time. If you 
fail to do so, you will have to repeat the entire procedure 
again. 
  This permit does not grant you the right to carry a firearm. 
Therefore, you will have to apply to the Interior Ministry 
within five days after the purchase of a firearm for a permit to 
CARRY that firearm. The latter document, made of special paper, 
will have your photo, name, personal code, and vital information 
about the firearm. You will have to carry this permit together 
with the firearm. [passage omitted] 
  There is only one store in Vilnius, subordinate to the Arms 
Fund, that is selling combat firearms for now. The government 
adopted such a decision because the police want to put tough 
controls on all arms imported into Lithuania. All firearms on 
sale will be tested by the police, and the information will be 
stored in a special catalog. The law allows you to acquire 
firearms of a caliber not exceeding 9 mm and with the weak 
firing power. Such firearms are expected to cost no less than 
$300. You will also be able to acquire 50 cartridges along with 
the firearm. 
  Before you put the firearm in your pocket, the police will 
visit your apartment and become convinced that you have a metal 
safe that will make your gun inaccessible. Moreover, the police 
will have the right to enter your apartment at any time and 
repeatedly check on security conditions. 
  You will be able to use the firearm to defend yourself, 
other 
people, property, the inviolability of your place of residence, 
other rights, the interests of society or the state, to prevent 
a direct threat or the appropriation of the firearm without 
overstepping the limits of necessary defense, to shoot an animal 
attacking a human being or posing a threat to the environment, 
or to call for help. In all these cases, you will be able to 
fire only after firing a warning shot into the air. 
  The latter will be unnecessary if the attack is unexpected 
or 
if the aggressor is armed. Every such shot will have to be 
reported to the police. 
  The law forbids firing at places of people's assemblies if 
this can harm outsiders, as well as at women, minor children, 
and handicapped people with distinct signs of disability, except 
those cases when they themselves attack and threaten with 
firearms. 
  Your firearms will undergo test firings at police stations 
every three years. You will also have to undergo a repeated 
medical examination to extend your permit. 
  You will be able to carry firearms only on the territory of 
Lithuania. If you are detained at the border, your firearm will 
be confiscated. If you need your firearm while travelling 
abroad, you will have to apply to officials of that country and 
receive their permission. You will have to show this permit to 
the Lithuanian Interior Ministry and get another one allowing 
you take the firearm abroad. 
  Incidentally, people who voluntarily return illegally kept 
arms to the police by 1 April, will not only remain unpunished, 
but will also receive compensation and be granted a chance to 
acquire a legal firearm. No compensation will be paid after 1 
April. [passage omitted] 
  Although the law was prepared by the Interior Ministry, it 
seems that no one listened to its opinion on the expediency of 
this document. Those deputies who had treaded many doorsteps at 
the ministry when requesting personal arms for themselves showed 
particular effort in "pushing the law through" the Seimas 
[parliament]. Having received a negative answer, they must have 
decided to arm everyone.

<F P=106> ["Live Dialogue" phone-in program with Ukrainian President </F>
Lenid Kravchuk in a live link-up from Kiev, with program host 
Andrey Skryabov, Mayak commentator Yuliy Semenov and MOSKOVSKIYE 
NOVOSTI journalist Lyudmila Telen] 
  [Excerpts] [Skryabin] Hello, esteemed television viewers! 
Today you and I have a dialogue with Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk, 
president of the Republic of Ukraine. He is in the television 
studio in Kiev. Good afternoon Mr. President! 
  [Kravchuk] Hello! 
  [Skryabin] We are happy to have you on our program. [passage 
omitted] 
  I think that the Institute of Sociological Research, headed 
by Professor Sokolov, is also taking part in our program today. 
The fact of the matter is that today we are using sociological 
research carried out here in Moscow in March and I think it will 
serve our program well. I would like to say that the 
sociological research which was carried out was devoted to the 
theme "Russia and Ukraine -- their joint situation -- public 
assessment of information and expectations." 
  Before putting a question to you, Mr. President, I would 
like to draw attention to two problems worrying the public in 
connection with the poll carried out by the Institute of 
Sociological Research. The first is the lack of information on 
the situation in Ukraine. In particular, according to the data, 
more than one-third of all those polled said they lacked 
information and the majority of those polled -- 55 percent -- 
think that the Russian mass media are not very objective about 
life in Ukraine, or simply carries distorted reports about it. 
I think that our meeting today will allow that problem to be 
resolved. 
  And the second problem is the public's great concern about 
relations between Russia and Ukraine. If you don't mind, Mr. 
President, I think that we will devote our conversation today to 
this problem. 
  Allow me to begin by trying to find out how you regard the 
stereotypes that exist today in Ukraine and Russia; stereotypes 
that on the whole are held to be true by people. We would like 
to know your point of view. Well, the first and main one is 
connected with the economy. 
  The fact of the matter is that sociological research showed 
that the state of Ukraine's economy, especially as far as 
Muscovites -- 65 percent -- are concerned, is seen as 
catastrophic, or very serious, while only eight percent think 
that there is a tendency for it to improve. [passage omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] There is no doubt that Ukraine's economic 
situation is serious. There are no doubts about that. We 
realize that ourselves, as do the government, the Supreme 
Council, and the authorities in the localities. But the main 
question probably is: Is the Ukraine's economy really as bad as 
its made out to be, and is Ukraine the only state of the former 
USSR where things are worse than everywhere else? And that lack 
of information has a good deal to do with that view. I will not 
give any figures but any unbiased visitor to Ukraine if he 
visits our shops today, not just in Kiev but in the oblasts, 
will see that there is a choice of sausage, meat, dairy 
products, groats, and pasta. Well, prices are another matter. 
But there is a choice, in the first place. In the second 
place, these are Ukrainian-produced goods. But if you live 
nearer Moscow you can visit the squares in front of the city's 
stations and its markets -- which I happen to know very well -- 
you will see an awful lot of Ukrainian products, of foodstuffs 
there. And I naturally ask the question: Is a poor people, or a 
people which are hungry, as it is sometimes made out to be, able 
to fill not just its own shops, but also Russia's markets and 
the squares in front of its stations. 
  Therefore, I think this stereotype appeared about a year 
ago. 
Yes, indeed, it is true, a year ago, the shelves of the shops in 
many regions of Ukraine were practically empty because a pricing 
and subsidy system was not developed. But that question has 
been taken off the agenda for now. There are two questions now: 
Prices and wages, but not food products. There are food 
products. That is why this stereotype is still around and they 
are still hanging on to it. Therefore, I would say: If there are 
any doubts here, take the television cameras into our shops and 
then you can see what things are like, if Ukraine is hungry 
today or not. That is a short reply. 
  But there are more profound questions -- questions of 
economic reform, questions of the transition to new economic 
relations, market reform, financial and credit reform, banking 
reform. But these questions are all so complex and difficult 
that they will take time, and these questions of reform are just 
as complex and difficult for all states of the former Soviet 
Union, including for Russia, too. Therefore, unless there are 
some other aims, I think it is simply unjustified to single out 
Ukraine today. 
  [Skryabin] Leonid Makarovych, you will, I hope, agree that 
perhaps the sorest problem both for Ukraine and for Russia is 
the disruption of economic ties. [passage omitted] What do you 
think about this situation? 
  [Kravchuk] One should first answer the question of what ties 
we are talking about here. If people say that all the ties that 
formerly existed should be reestablished, this cannot be done, 
because many enterprises in both Russia and Ukraine that were 
previously linked with such ties either no longer exist, or have 
switched to new output, so it is impossible. I advocate 
strengthening ties, but on a new basis, on new principles. 
  Let us just take a look at these principles. Who is it who 
should establish ties -- President Yeltsin and President 
Kravchuk -- or the enterprises and collectives themselves? 
Collectives that have an interest in establishing ties have 
already got them going -- and long since, at that. 
  Secondly, what should the state do to develop, expand, and 
strengthen ties? It must create the conditions for that to 
happen. In Ukraine, for example, we have abolished all customs 
duties on goods being exported from Ukraine. We have suggested 
to Russia setting up a free trade zone. Russia has not as yet 
accepted this. It has opted for most favorable status, but with 
certain goods exempted, namely gas, oil, nonferrous metals, 
timber, and some others. So we get a sort of cut-off zone. 
  For our part, we did not initiate setting up a customs 
barrier, nor creating any sort of obstacles. Let us be quite 
frank about this, it is the sorest point at the moment. If we, 
today, are advocating a single market or a common market within 
the context of the CIS, then we certainly support that. But for 
this to come about, conditions have to be equal. If today, for 
example, the Russian consumer buys oil at 30 percent less than 
oil costs the Ukrainian consumer, and the same thing applies to 
gas -- how can Ukrainian manufacturers withstand the competition 
in this common market that it is proposed we should set up? In 
order to strengthen ties and develop good relations, identical 
common conditions must be created. Customs policy, taxation 
policy, pricing policy, and other forms must all be coordinated, 
just as is done in all civilized countries. But when this is not 
done because each state pursues its own interests -- I am not 
singling out Ukraine as being the most reticent here, so to 
speak -- if each state pursues its own goals and at the same 
time chants the slogan, let us join together, then no one has 
ever managed this before, nor will anyone do so now. That is why 
I advocate that it should be the collectives who strengthen 
ties, on the basis of the new situation in their work and life; 
and that states should create the conditions for it, including 
by accords between states -- Ukraine, incidentally, has signed 
almost all the documents that have been put forward within the 
context of the CIS and also in relations between Russia. This 
removes all the problems and questions. It will neither concern 
the government nor the president, it will be the concern of the 
collective that has an interest in the market, the ties, and in 
ensuring normal payments. 
  [Semenov] Then why do you occupy such a restrained and 
cautious position regarding economic union? 
  [Kravchuk] I will tell you. Economic union should openly 
specify to the whole people the principles of its development. 
To demonstrate this, I will touch upon the following issue: a 
single ruble zone. Russia, as a center of gravity -- which is 
natural -- and also as the initiator of setting up a single 
ruble zone, should say openly what the principles of joining the 
single ruble zone are. What will the states which will join the 
single ruble zone lose or win economically, politically, etc.? 
Moreover, this should be said openly. And then each person 
would decide whether it will develop as an independent state on 
the basis on its own currency and relations between states 
develop in the framework of equality and partnership, or whether 
there will be a single ruble zone, single currency, single 
financial and banking system, and then one should forget about 
independence. The people should not be deceived. 
  Look at the practice. Why did Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan 
refuse the single ruble zone? Because a general phrase was 
written: A single ruble zone. It should be clearly stated: What 
are the motives of the national bank, or the Russian bank? What 
are the motives of the Finance Ministry? What has to be given 
up, what should be gained? Then I will say to my people: 
Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, this is the option you are being 
offered -- openly and honestly. If you are in favor, then go 
ahead -- with or without me, enter the zone. But when this is 
done with eyes closed, when they say first you sign and then we 
specify, the result is that some people enter and then leave. 
Surely, it is this that has led to such complexities with 
Belarus -- because there is not absolute clarity. 
  Therefore, I have said before and I am say now: We should 
define our position, whether we will build an independent state 
based on the principles of good-neighborliness, friendship and 
partnership, helping each other, or whether we will unite in a 
single state with a single ruble, a single bank, single 
taxation, and single customs. We should ask the people. 
  At present, I base my opinions on the fact that 92 percent 
of 
Ukraine's people voted for independence. One should ask the 
people: What do you want? We cannot rely on the people and, on 
the other hand, decide these issues without the people at 
somebody else's will. 
  There should be clarity and openness, inter alia regarding 
Belovezhskaya Pushcha. This is also one of the stereotypes. 
The Soviet Union did not disintegrate in Belovezhskaya Pushcha. 
This happened before Belovezhskaya Pushcha. The final decision 
was not taken in Belovezhskaya Pushcha but in Almaty, in the 
Almaty Declaration, but nobody admits this. By the way, as for 
Belovezhskaya Pushcha, not only the presidents, but also the 
prime ministers signed the documents there. One prefers to 
forget this because one wants to find who is to blame, but those 
who are to blame were before the event. Believe me, they were 
not in Ukraine. 
  [Skryabin] Thank you very much. Leonid Makarovych, 
speaking about Belovezhskaya Pushcha, if our Ostankino 
Television prepares a program connected with Belovezhskaya 
Pushcha within the framework of Live Dialogue, are you prepared 
to take part in it? 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, absolutely! Quite a bit of time has passed 
since the Soviet Union collapsed and since the time of 
perestroyka and it is time to tell the people how that process 
developed, who stood on the path of that process, as one of our 
leaders used to say, and who enabled all that happened to 
happen. And most importantly, did we have another way out? Was 
it people's will or was it an objective and natural process? I 
think that it was an objective and natural process of 
disintegration. But were we able to go through that natural 
process as subjects, in accordance with will and reason, or were 
mistakes made and who made the mistakes and why? People must be 
told because myths and illusions around that and the search for 
guilty parties in the form of several people have gone too far 
already, and some zealous participants in that process are now 
making themselves out to be super-internationalists and they 
pass over in smiling silence their participation in that. I am 
not accusing anyone. I repeat, that was a natural process and 
by that disintegration we stopped the whole thing collapsing -- 
that is objectively -- but nevertheless, since things have gone 
so far, people must be told the truth. [passage omitted] 
  [Telen] Mr. President, I regret having to interrupt that 
interesting conversation about Belovezhskaya Pushcha, but since 
we have agreed to make a separate program on it, I will return 
to the economy, to economics, and politics. You were quite 
right when you said that the economy is closely linked to 
politics today and often is based on politics, but as long as 
the economic situation, in particular, in Ukraine is so serious, 
there is always the chance that another state, not necessarily 
Russia, will use economic pressure for political aims. There 
has been much talk of that in various situations, both with 
regard to Russia and to Ukraine, in particular, the recent gas 
situation, with Ukraine's debt to the Russian Gazprom. 
[passage omitted] What do you think? Can Russia use economic 
sanctions for political ends? Is that a reality? And do you 
see such a danger for Ukraine? 
  [Kravchuk] There are a number of complex aspects for me. The 
first is that gas and oil must be paid for. And in Ukraine 
today, the following situation has taken shape: Since we have no 
real possibilities of accumulating hard currency because Russia 
does not buy in great quantities the goods that are being sold 
to it. I am speaking about Russian enterprises. For instance, 
a Russian enterprise can wait to buy a KRAZ [truck made at the 
Kremenchug automobile works] for a six months or a year, whereas 
gas is an everyday necessity. In other words, we cannot 
accumulate hard currency in selling our goods to Russia today. 
There are no quotas on the European market. So we have a 
product, but we cannot sell it and accumulate hard currency. 
Therefore, it is not possible to pay for gas and oil in a 
timely manner. What can I say if there are not any payments? 
The tap can always be turned off. That can always be dished up 
as pressure, anything you like, and the following explanation 
can be given: You are not paying, we are not supplying you. 
Therefore, there is a problem here, and we are now making every 
effort to mobilize forces, reserves, resources, or by other 
means, to accumulate hard currency and to settle with Gazprom. 
But I have a question, too. The gas could have been turned off 
on 26 February. There were no payments there either, but for 
some reason it was turned off on 3 March while I was in the 
United States. I cannot explain why it happened like that -- 
for it is probably no coincidence, people say. That is the 
question! Some are always exploiting the time, political, or 
economic factors to create problems around it. I think we will 
find a solution -- there is no doubt -- and relations will be 
normal, payments will be normal. Ukraine is not a poor state. 
It will settle up. Incidentally, we owe everyone today -- we 
owe the West -- and the West deferred loan and interest 
payments. When normal interests and the prospect for relations 
are taking into account, all factors are taken into account and 
the main factor is our future, our good relations with our 
neighbor, with people with whom we lived for 340 years together 
with one territorial integrity, lived in the Soviet Union, 
shared sorrows and difficulties and good times. Therefore, I 
would refrain from having only mercantile relations now or 
taking advantages of difficulties with Ukraine. Ukraine will 
not be a debtor. It will settle up -- if not today, then 
tomorrow. 
  [Semenov] Leonid Makarovych, there is another moral and 
political aspect. Is Ukraine in a position to guarantee fully 
that Russian gas and oil reach Europe? You know there have been 
some unpleasant situations. 
  [Kravchuk] The position is this. We have now set up a 
working group, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk, 
which together with local administrations has placed the passage 
of gas and oil under the strictest supervision. We believe that 
this is absolutely unacceptable, and believe me, I am convinced 
of that. If anyone is doing this, or does it in the future, he 
will be called to account. 
  [Semenov] [Passage omitted] Recently a sort of diplomatic, 
perhaps friendly or unfriendly triangle has become established, 
namely Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. What is the role 
of the United States here, in your view? Is it serving to 
reconcile us, to remind us of our old friendship, or will we 
perhaps feel ashamed in front of the United States and come to 
agreement without its help? 
  [Skryabin] Well, if I can approach this from another angle, 
it has been said that America is our new friend. Is this not in 
some way the loss of our old friend Russia? 
  [Kravchuk, laughing] Well, I reckon it is like this: The 
fact 
is that we have all been brought up on a specific sort of 
ideology, an ideology that declared all bourgeois, capitalist 
countries to be our enemies. Now, of course, even some friends 
are difficult to interpret, But I think the more friends the 
better. In any case, I am convinced that America will lay no 
claims to Ukraine, whether territorial or any other. The fact 
that we are establishing ties with the United States, France, or 
Great Britain does not mean this is detrimental to Russia. 
  I have said before and I am saying now: our relations with 
Russia have a special status. These are relations of 
partnership, friendship, and good-neighborliness. There is no 
other way for Ukraine or Russia. Historically and objectively 
and, if you prefer it, subjectively, this friendship is at the 
level of everyday life. If, for example, we are talking of 
friendship with the United States at the level of government 
structures, at state level, here it is at the level of people, 
border areas and families who have friends and relatives or 
children. It became integrated at the level of everyday life. 
  I can see that Russia seems to be jealous, as if the fact 
that Ukraine is making friends and establishing good relations 
with others will be at Russia's expense. I even like this. It 
looks as if Russians love Ukrainians very much and they do not 
want to let them go because of their friendly feelings. 
  But I would like to see one thing: so that this love should 
be expressed in some concrete steps with regard to Ukraine -- in 
providing aid in the economic reform and in the reform of the 
political system. In mitigating those harsh processes that are 
under way in our country, inevitable as they are. In solving 
calmly and equitably the problems of nuclear weapons, of the 
Black Sea fleet, and everything connected with these. If this 
love, these good relations, are expressed in such concrete 
steps, then this love can only be to the benefit of us alive 
today, and of those who will be living tomorrow and the day 
after tomorrow, for we have to live on the same planet, live and 
be friends, as the saying goes, and we cannot avoid that. There 
is no other option, no alternative. Only hotheads can think 
otherwise. Those Russian Federation citizens who often brand 
the official authority, including the president, as virtually 
nationalist, because he pursues this policy, should reflect. 
  This, too, is a stereotype of the same ideology. If somebody 
speaks in favor of an independent state, nothing more is 
required. If he is in favor of independent Ukraine he is a 
nationalist but if he is against independent Ukraine he is an 
internationalist and is most welcome, that is the point. But 
then the following question could be asked: If a Russian speaks 
in favor of independent Russia who is he? This question is 
somehow avoided. We should not, therefore, be guided by 
stereotypes in our life. We have risen to a new plane, new 
philosophy, new ideology, and we should rid ourselves gradually, 
step by step, of nationalism, chauvinism, or national-patriotism 
which, I am convinced, can only lead to confrontation, not to 
good relations. 
  [Semenov] But for love to blossom it should be reciprocal, 
Leonid Makarovych, do you agree? 
  [Kravchuk] Certainly. I cannot, therefore, give you any 
example saying that there is no reciprocal love on the Ukrainian 
part. When the Russian Supreme Soviet, contrary to common 
sense, adopts a decision on the status of Sevastopol and sends 
its people to the Crimea to stir up separatist moods, believe 
me, Ukraine is not sending anyone to Rostov or Tatarstan or 
other republics to create difficulties there. And now tell me 
who loves whom reciprocally: the one who wants to interfere in 
the other's territorial affairs -- and I find this very 
difficult to explain -- or the one who bends. Or do you want us 
to bend over backward? One should understand that a person has 
a limit, he has honor which is above all, beyond which economic 
and other problems become of secondary importance. It is how 
people are. 
  [Skryabin] Thank you very much. Leonid Makarovych, I would 
like to refer to the findings of the Institute of Sociological 
Research of Professor Sokolov again. It also is about 
stereotypes. The majority of Muscovites who were polled in the 
survey are very negative about your political course. Fifty-six 
percent think that you follow a policy of isolation and 
separatism and are a Ukrainian nationalist. 
  [Kravchuk, laughing] Well, what did I say! 
  [Skryabin] But I think that Yevgeniy Andreyvich (Ushakov) 
from Moscow is right when he says that he hopes there are people 
in the leadership of Ukraine today who are as wise as Bogdan 
Khmelnitskiy [17th century Ukrainian leader], who understand 
that only a close union between the people of Russia and 
Ukraine, a union without ambition, will bring calm and 
prosperity to these peoples. 
  [Kravchuk] I completely agree. But there is just one thing. 
The nature of that union must be determined. You know there are 
calls at the moment in our country -- the pre-election campaign 
is underway -- some say we are for union with Russia, for the 
creation of a single credit and banking system, for the creation 
of a single monetary system. Down with the frontiers! Down 
with the customs! Down with everything! But we say: For an 
independent and self- sufficient Ukraine. I want to ask: Is 
this logical and do these actions and ideas go together? 
Therefore, there is no need to deceive the people! I said that 
right at the outset. Let us determine what the economic union 
will be like, what the ruble zone, the nonruble zone will be 
like, let us tell the people and then let the people decide what 
it should give back and what it should take. But to simply make 
declarations will bring only confrontation. 
  I was and will be a supporter of friendship, neighborliness, 
and partnership with Russia not because it is my particular 
opinion but because this is what history dictates. That is the 
crux of the matter. But let us channel everything else not 
dictated by history into a civilized framework, along the lines 
of good relations, mutual understanding, partnership, equality, 
and then all the problems will disappear. Believe me, if 
somebody wants to dictate and somebody else is to be 
subordinate, the problems will not go away. 
  [Telen] Mr. President, then let us go on to the problem of 
elections. We know that Ukraine has embarked upon the final 
part of the pre-election campaign -- I mean parliamentary 
elections. The presidential elections are ahead and... 
  [Skryabin, interrupting] And the local soviet elections... 
  [Telen, continues] And the local soviet elections, too. 
Relations between Ukraine and Russia are one of the central 
questions of the pre-election campaign. But I would like to ask 
you about something else. It is known that around 70 percent of 
the electorate intend to take part in the first round of the 
parliamentary elections -- that is quite a big figure -- but 
according to forecasts by many Ukrainian specialists, the matter 
will not be decided at the first round of voting, since there 
are too many candidates for every deputy's seat and it is quite 
likely that parliament will not be elected at these elections. 
Tell us please, how do you forecast the situation if parliament 
is not elected as a result of the first and second round of 
voting? What will the situation in Ukraine be like? 
  [Kravchuk] I would like parliament to be elected, that is 
the first thing, and that wise, calm and professionally trained 
politicians, people capable of resolving domestic and external 
problems in line with international principles and the interests 
of their people enter parliament. This is my profound wish and 
conviction. There are really around over 5,000 candidates for 
450 seats. That works out about 12 people per constituency. It 
is unlikely that this problem will be resolved in the first 
round. The second round is more difficult from the legal point 
of view: 50 percent turnout is required and over 25 percent are 
required to vote. 
  There will be difficulties. But if parliament is not 
elected, a parliamentary crisis could arise because some 
deputies will be elected and it cannot be ruled out that one 
deputy could hold a seat in an old constituency, another in a 
new constituency and it will be difficult to manage that 
situation. But elections to local bodies of power and 
presidential elections in June still lie ahead. Unless all of 
that is decided in March or April, I fear that a power vacuum 
could be formed and then we will have to take some kind of 
extraordinary decisions. I think we will be able to decide that 
problem within the framework of democracy, within the framework 
of the interests of the state so as not to bury the state, not 
to allow executive structures of power to disintegrate. We have 
bodies of power in the localities, there are presidential 
structures, there are local soviets. I think that we can and 
will be able to run the state with the help of these structures, 
having decided the question here in the center in accordance in 
the interests of both the people and the state. 
  [Telen] Mr. President, can presidential elections be 
postponed given the complicated situation? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, you see, I would not like to initiate this 
because some people could view this as my desire to put off 
elections. It was me who proposed early elections of both 
parliament and president. But today, according to my 
information from localities and leaders of different ranks and 
the letters and telegrams that keep arriving, first, time limits 
are very compressed, second, it will be summer, harvesting will 
be underway. And then, people say that if the parliament issue 
is not settled, if the parliament fails to adopt two important 
laws, on local power structures and their functions, plenary 
powers and interaction with the central authorities, and if a 
new law on presidency is not adopted -- because the current law 
defines the president as head of state and executive authority 
and also defines relevant functions and plenary powers -- then 
the elections can be not simply inexpedient but even dangerous 
to a degree because a power vacuum will set in. The central 
bodies of authorities will have no influence over local bodies 
of authority, because there will be no law to regulate these 
relations. So people notice this, they are worried and are 
asking to postpone these elections until these two laws are 
adopted and to hold the elections at a more convenient time. 
Well, I cannot solve this problem on my own. 
  [Skryabin] Incidentally, Leonid Makarovych, your view fits 
in with those of our viewers. [passage omitted] 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, there is concern, I feel it, too, in 
telegrams, letters, or telephone calls that are received not 
only by my office but by other structures, too, including the 
Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Council. In other words, 
the people are alarmed. But since there is alarm and 
uncertainty, which is undeniable, all this should be solved in 
such a way that the management of the state, the state itself, 
and its independence do not suffer in the process. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Semenov] I know that preventing any form of bloodshed in 
Ukraine is your political priority. At the same time, you have 
declared the holding of referendum in Crimea illegal. It will, 
however, be held, most probably. What actions can you take? I 
can hardly imagine. 
  [Kravchuk] You see, here we have the following problem. I 
agree with Andrey Georgiyevich [Skryabin] that if we start 
arguing today about who owns Crimea this argument will be very 
difficult to bring to a logical conclusion. It depends on what 
period, time span, or historical period you examine. I would 
not raise this issue at all. The way I formulate the question 
is the following: Do we need today, considering the difficulties 
that have arisen within the CIS framework and the difficulties 
related to the former Soviet Union -- do we need to raise the 
issue of solving the Crimean problem? My answer is an 
unequivocal no, if we are to be guided by common sense and 
political expediency and consider the dangers that lie in wait 
for us along this road. This is my profound conviction. 
  Second, after the president of Crimea was elected, our first 
meeting in Ukraine was interesting. The president did not ask a 
single political question. 
  He [Meshkov] said: The main issue for me is the economic 
program. After this, I gave instructions to the government, and 
we created for Crimea, together with Crimea, a budget balancing 
expenditure if the Crimean authorities ensure the revenue. In 
addition, we added a specific sum for the Crimean Tatar people 
as was done in all our budgets. So, the main issue of the 
budget was removed from the agenda. 
  Now we need to work. And here I ask myself the question: 
Should one tackle the economic issue or kindle the political 
problems again? Such as: Are you in favor of dual citizenship? 
Is it not understood that the majority of the population is in 
favor of dual citizenship in Crimea? Are not the other 
questions asked in the poll understood? But the main issue is 
the competence of the all-Ukraine referendum and not the Crimean 
referendum: This is, in accordance with Ukraine's Constitution 
and with the law on the all-Ukraine local referendum, the 
competence of Ukraine. That is, no part can resolve this 
problem unless it expresses the will of the entire people. 
  That is the first thing. The second thing is that there is a 
ratified international principle, the Helsinki Process, which 
takes very seriously all problems related to territorial borders 
and others, because they understand that confrontation is in 
store here, there may be blood in store here. Therefore, I 
could not but annul these two points in the Crimean president's 
decree, because they contradict the Constitution and our laws. 
The point that relates to the competence of Crimea remains. 
  So, conditions have been created today for Crimea to work 
economically and resolve its problems. What conditions are 
these? Inadequate in respect of the opportunities, indeed, 
difficult and hard ones, yes indeed, but we have to work. I can 
imagine what will happen after this referendum. It has 
absolutely no juridical force whatsoever, but I can well imagine 
how many of your Ostankino broadcasts there will be, not to say 
from your editorial office: The Crimeans have expressed their 
will, and so on and so forth. This is all politicizing, 
whipping up passions, the newspapers will go on about it, there 
will all sorts of rallies, everything to show what the Crimeans 
want. But can what the Crimeans want today be settled without 
the involvement of Ukraine and Russia? In keeping with the 
Helsinki and UN norms and other principles, two conditions are 
essential: First, the agreement of Ukraine and of Russia. Third, 
the expression of the people's will. Or rather second, the 
expression of the people's will. But those conditions are not 
present, all these expressions of the will of part of the people 
will constantly come up against the barriers of international 
principles, territorial borders etc., and so on and so forth. 
Can we really set out on this path today? 
  This is why I have been appealing and continue to appeal: 
There should be an end to politicizing, exploitation, and 
playing the Crimean card. It will not lead to anything good. 
We have the experience of the Dniester Region and Karabakh. 
Surely we do not need a few more trouble spots for the hotheads 
to finally understand that they must stop. Because we are 
already tired of receiving death notifications. How many of 
these must there be? 
  [Skryabin] Leonid Makarovych, thank you, I am sorry but we 
have already run over our airtime, I cannot even offer you time 
to bid farewell. [passage omitted]

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry arrived in 
Kiev yesterday on a two-day official visit. I have three tasks 
to fulfill during my visit to Ukraine, stated U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry at Borispol airport. The first task is 
to strengthen and renew relations with our old friends; second, 
is to continue working with the Ukrainian Government and the 
Defense Ministry to step up the implementation of the very 
important trilateral Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. agreement signed by 
Presidents Leonid Kravchuk, Boris Yeltsin, and Bill Clinton in 
Moscow in January of this year; and my third task will be to 
cooperate with the Ukrainian Government within the framework of 
the program of economic development and conversion of military 
industrial enterprises. 
  The U.S. delegation is planning to visit Pervomaysk and 
acquaint itself with how a variety of programs on dismantling 
nuclear weapons according to the Moscow trilateral agreement are 
being implemented. After that, Secretary Perry will visit a 
classified site in Dnepropetrovsk, the biggest production 
complex specializing in missile equipment production. For the 
first time in the history of such enterprises, the Pentagon 
chief later emphasized, a U.S. secretary of defense will have 
the opportunity to personally observe operations at one of these 
sites.

  [Text] The command of the Ukrainian Navy insists on the 
obligatory coordination with it of the movement of Black Sea 
naval ships and units. However, the Russian command refuses to 
meet the demand, a senior spokesman for the Ukrainian naval 
command told INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  He described as provocative another refusal by the naval 
command to inform the Ukrainian defense ministry of the warships 
putting to sea. 
  INTERFAX earlier reported that on 17 March, 25 warships, two 
submarines and five auxiliary ships put to sea for training 
purposes. 
  The spokesman said that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry will 
force the command to comply with Ukrainian laws. 
  Sources close to the Ukrainian naval staff have told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine that on 17 March one Ukrainian warship set out 
to sea. 
  Commenting on the statement by the Ukrainian Navy senior 
spokesman, Andrey Grachev, the acting chief of the Fleet's press 
center, said that "it is not command actions but such statements 
that are provocative." 
  Firstly, in line with Ukrainian and Crimean laws on troop 
movement "we must warn the Crimean parliament and its speaker 
and this we did." 
  Secondly, the Fleet commander, Admiral Baltin, in a telegram 
to Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, warned him back 
in February that ships were planned to put to sea in March 1994, 
and this was done too, said Grachev. 
  Speaking about one of the four ships of the Ukrainain Navy 
putting to sea, Andrey Grachev voiced the hope that it would 
return safely to the base.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 19 Mar -- Mustafa Dzhamilev, chairman of 
the Majlis of the Crimean-Tatar people granted an interview to 
the newspaper FLOT UKRAYINYY [FLEET OF UKRAINE]. He said in 
particular, that "Yuriy Meshkov is not a president today for the 
Crimean Tatar people," because his program envisages a revision 
of the existing borders. The chairman of the Majlis said that 
"of all the states of the former union, Ukraine is the only 
country today that renders the most effective assistance to us. 
We are well aware of how complicated the current economic 
situation in the country is and therefore we are not putting 
forward any particular claims." 
  Replying to the question: "Is Russia extending any help to 
you," Dzhamilev said: "We do not receive any practical 
assistance from Russia, however, we should not forget that in 
the years when our people were subject to deportation, Crimea 
was under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation, and we 
hope to intensify all-around methods of influencing Moscow, 
which bears the bulk of responsibility for the genocide of the 
Crimean Tatars. We will strive to achieve that Moscow finance 
the process of the repatriation, rehabilitation [of the Crimean 
Tatars], and compensation for the losses inflicted on our 
people." 
  Replying to the questions "how does he assess the statement 
by President Yuriy Meshkov to the effect that Ukraine should 
pull its troops out of the territory of the peninsula, and does 
the Black Sea Fleet ensure Crimea's security," Dzhamilev said: 
"This is an irresponsible and provocative statement... the 
Black Sea Fleet issue should be solved quicker and the 
stationing of the foreign state's ships near our shores is one 
of the elements that destabilizes the political situation in 
Crimea."

<F P=106> [Report by UNIAN's Mariya Starozhitskaya: "Nixon Called </F>
Kravchuk One of the World's Best Strategists"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- After being in Kiev for four hours ex-U.S. 
President Richard Nixon said of President Leonid Kravchuk: "I 
have always said, and I repeat, that he is one of the world's 
best strategists, who accords with Ukraine's interests and 
understands problems on a global scale." 
  "I spent approximately a week in Russia -- everyone knows 
that after the elections, its position with regard to Ukraine 
and other neighbors became more tough and aggressive," Nixon 
said. "I do not mean that the majority of the leaders in Russia 
now support the position of Zhirinovskiy and others, but in the 
future, there could certainly be precedents when the [United] 
States will have to choose whether to look to Russia or Ukraine. 
  ``Here I will express my personal opinion: Both the United 
States and the Ukrainian people must be interested in Russia's 
economic and political progress. If economic conditions improve 
in Russia, this will mean a worsening of the positions of 
extremist forces such as Zhirinovskiy, who pursues an aggressive 
policy toward Ukraine. Russia is a great state, but it is not 
in its best interest to bite off more than it can chew: It has 
quite enough domestic problems, and I consider economic 
imperialism just as unacceptable as military imperialism." 
  Leonid Kravchuk pointed out that Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov has twice violated Ukrainian legislation with his edict 
on holding a referendum. 
  "It is not a normal democratic and peaceful process to start 
one's activity by violating the law and the constitution," 
Kravchuk said. "If President Meshkov resorts to a 
confrontation, this will be on his conscience." 
  Richard Nixon added that he considers the 19th-century 
Crimean War the most stupid war in history. One such war is 
quite sufficient.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid </F>
Krachuk by unidentified correspondent on 20 March; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk was 
interviewed today by Ukrainian television. The conversation 
focussed on election issues and relations between central 
executive power bodies and the local executive power in the 
autonomous Republic of Crimea. 
  [Correspondent] Crimea's top executive, President Yuriy 
Meshkov, plans to conduct a poll on 27 March. There has been a 
lot of talk about this poll on the air.... 
  [Kravchuk, interrupting] I talked about it, too. 
  [Correspondent] And about your decree that abolished some of 
its premises. But a lot will depend on, and I quote the U.S. 
embassy press statement, Kiev's considerable self-control. Does 
Kiev have that considerable self-control, Leonid Makarovych? 
  [Kravchuk] Of course it does, because, first of all, this 
self-control needs to be understood in the way that we are 
acting in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of 
Ukraine. It is very important. Whereas the president of Crimea 
has exceeded his powers, that is, has ignored the law, both the 
Ukrainian one and his own, the president of Ukraine is acting 
clearly within the framework of the law. Thus, if you put both 
of these documents [the two presidents' decrees] on the table, 
then you will see that we are acting clearly in accordance with 
the law, while the president of Crimea has violated the norms of 
both Ukraine's and his own law. And that is dangerous. Our 
self-control shows in the fact that we are staying always within 
the law. The Crimean president's lack of self-control in this 
case shows in the fact that he wants to break the law, and he is 
breaking it. I already said this, and I want to say once again 
that the main thing that needs to be done in Crimea today is to 
solve economic problems. 
  [Announcer] That was an excerpt from an interview with 
President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. You can see it in full 
today, at 2200 in the television program "Without Protocol."

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Alsufyev, chairman of the Central </F>
Electoral Commission of the Republic of Crimea, by N. Gavrileva, 
under the rubric "Let Us Be Specific": "Proceeding Toward the 
Elections. Why Was the Edict Not Accepted for Execution?"] 
  [Text] Yesterday KRYMSKIYE IZVESTIYA published the Decree 
of the Central Electoral Commission "On the Edict of the 
President of the Republic of Crimea `On Holding a Poll of 
Republic of Crimea Citizens.'" We asked V. Alsufyev, chairman of 
the commission, to comment on the situation. 
  [Gavrileva] Viktor Vladimirovich, in its decree the Central 
Electoral Commission actually refused to execute this edict of 
the president. Please explain to us the reason for the 
appearance of the decree; after all, this is direct disobedience 
of the authority of the president! 
  [Alsufyev] This has to do with the fact that the edict of 
the 
president faced the Central Electoral Commission with a choice 
between accepting the demand to violate the law and incurring 
the displeasure of the president's team. Despite the fact that a 
great variety of political forces are represented on our 
commission, the decision was made unanimously--to stick to the 
position of the law. 
  Please note Point 4 of the edict in which the president 
obligated the Central Electoral Commission to conduct the poll 
simultaneously with the elections. However, the point is that 
the Central Electoral Commission is not by any means 
subordinated to the executive authorities in some way, and a 
demand, even by the president, does not and cannot entail legal 
consequences in the form of its execution. Since in keeping with 
the law the commission is the supreme institution for organizing 
and holding elections of deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the 
Crimea, the commission reports solely to the Supreme Soviet of 
the Crimea, and only on the basis of its decision does the 
commission have the legal authority to take measures that do not 
fall within its jurisdiction. 
  Furthermore, the edict provides for appointing 
"representatives of the president" to electoral commissions. 
This amounts to a direct violation of the Constitution of the 
Republic of Crimea and electoral legislation. Had this happened, 
it would have been grounds to consider the election of deputies 
invalid. 
  Therefore, it is not some kind of disobedience to the 
supreme 
official that is at issue but rather the need to take measures 
to uphold the law. 
  Believe me, the commission has no dearth of problems other 
than becoming involved in a conflict with the presidential 
authority. The Crimea is now holding elections which are without 
parallel in history in terms of complexity. While it is the 
Central Electoral Commission with regard to 66 single-seat 
electoral districts, our commission at the same time exercises 
the powers of a district commission in the multiple-seat 
electoral district in which the Crimea elects deputies under the 
proportional system from four political parties and one 
electoral bloc. At the same time, our commission must operate in 
the mode of five district electoral commissions for national 
electoral districts. The lot of district commissions is even 
more difficult: They also are commissions for elections to the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine at the same time. 
  [Gavrileva] Pardon me, but a document such as this edict 
could not have appeared without prior coordination with the 
Central Electoral Commission. Where were you before? 
  [Alsufyev] The edict came as a complete surprise to us. We 
saw the text as late as 11 March in the newspapers. I think that 
a realistic scenario for solving the emergent problem which 
would comply with legal norms would have been quite possible. 
The Central Electoral Commission always provides the necessary 
consultative assistance benevolently. We use professional 
lawyers from the Ministry of Justice of the Crimea and the state 
law department of the Supreme Soviet for such efforts. If 
necessary, we verify our decisions with the prosecutor's office 
and the Supreme Court of the Crimea, that is to say, we do 
everything possible to strictly uphold the law. However, in this 
case, a consultation with us was apparently not needed. 
  [Gavrileva] Incidentally, on the day the edict was 
published, 
readers called our editorial office requesting that the meaning 
of some of provisions be clarified. Perhaps the period of 16 
days is too short, after all: It turns out that the voter (that 
is, the citizen taking part in the poll) is being deliberately 
faced with a situation in which he is simply deprived of an 
opportunity to grasp the essence of the questions and to make a 
determination concerning his choice.... 
  [Alsufyev] You are right. I would like to not assess the 
edict from the standpoint of the content of the questions. 
However, the time factor is very significant indeed. You will 
agree that it is necessary to be in possession of a certain 
volume of legal information in order to respond to each question 
intelligently. Time is needed to this end, and a lot of it. 
  At present, space in newspapers and air time are the main 
point: The mass media are overburdened with articles related to 
elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea and the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine to begin with. We have received a great many 
complaints from candidates for deputy about the absence of an 
opportunity to use the mass media because of the superimposition 
of the two election campaigns. And what if we also include the 
poll, with its complex questions? 
  You will agree that there is indeed no real opportunity to 
ensure a deliberate choice and a free expression of the will of 
citizens within this period of time. 
  [Gavrileva] Indeed, technically it is very difficult to do 
this on 27 March. What is to be done next? 
  [Alsufyev] There is only one way out: The president should 
correlate his intentions with the requirements of the law.

<F P=106> ["Election Appeal of the Republic Committee of the Communist </F>
Party to All Communists and Their Supporters and the Electorate 
of Our Republic"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Crimeans! 
  The political and economic situation in Crimea remains 
serious and unpredictable after the presidential elections also. 
  The results of socioeconomic development of 1993 have borne 
out the gloomiest forecasts. They have made it possible to see 
that a number of political leaders have for the sake of their 
own ambitions reduced the people to indigence and humiliation. 
The main political slogan with which the Communists are going 
into the elections is labor, the power of the people, and 
justice. We call on all to unite around these principles. 
<H5>  I. Political Situation in Crimea </H5>
  Under the influence of the forces that still really dispose 
of power the creation of new political parties and their hurried 
registration have been artificially accelerated in the Republic. 
The intention of the sponsors of this campaign is to camouflage 
the representatives of the "power party" and get them elected to 
the Supreme Soviet and pilfer the votes of the electorate from 
parties which already have their own political character. To 
this end there has been the nomination in all head-to-head 
constituencies of numerous so-called "independent" candidates 
and also the mass nomination of candidates occupying the most 
important positions in the power structures. All this is geared 
to a conclusive change of sociopolitical system. 
  Confirming its statutory and program positions as a party 
expressing the interests of the working class, peasantry, and 
intelligentsia and all working people and the positions of 
internationalism and patriotism, the Republic committee of the 
Communist Party of Crimea sees the actions of the organizers of 
the "new" parties as a manifest aspiration to split both the 
workers movement and all patriotic forces in Crimea, disconnect 
our society, counterpose town to country, the agricultural 
laborer to the plant worker, and the youth to the elderly, and 
to artificially embroil people of different social groups. 
<H5>  II. Main Goals of the Communist Party of Crimea </H5>
  The main goal set by candidates from the Communist Party is 
the restoration and realization of social safeguards. The great 
state in which our peoples lived prior to the Belovezha 
conspiracy was not, of course, devoid of shortcomings. The 
political and economic structure was in need of serious 
improvement, but instead of the gradual reform and strengthening 
of the system of the organs of the power of the people--the 
soviets--and a smooth transition to the new principles of 
economic policy, indiscriminate processes which signified the 
disarticulation of the Soviet Union and the profound crisis of 
the national economy gained the ascendancy. The Communist Party 
of Crimea links, therefore, the possibility of the achievement 
in full of its main goal--the realization of social 
safeguards--with the restoration of a unified state based on 
common borders, customs, credit system, and monetary unit and 
the creation of the corresponding organs of administration. The 
form of state arrangement of this voluntary union of the peoples 
(federation, confederation) should be determined at a referendum. 
<H5>  III. Place and role of the Republic of Crimea </H5>
  History no longer allows of the possibility of tarrying over 
the adoption of a decision, this is today a matter of life and 
death! The political and economic crisis in Ukraine is 
intensifying increasingly, and Crimea must realize its right to 
the independent determination of economic priorities. It is 
essential primarily to surmount the spiral of hyperinflation, 
and this is only possible within the framework of the closest 
alliance with Russia and the other republics. For Ukraine this 
should be a powerful motivating factor of the closest economic 
integration in an alliance with Russia and the other republics. 
  This would be a first step toward a new, unified state, in 
whose restoration the Republic of Crimea is destined to perform 
its particular historical role. 
<H3>  IV. Stabilization of the Living Standard of Society and 
Restoration of Social Safeguards </H3>
  In view of the urgent need for a halt to the continued fall 
in the living standard of the majority of the population below 
the poverty line and the threat of starvation, the Communists 
will seek persistently in the Supreme Soviet of Crimea the 
adoption of a law on the building of a state system of social 
protection of the populace on the principle of the conformity of 
pay, pensions, and grants to the actual subsistence minimum. 
  The Communist deputies will demand of the executive specific 
measures geared to the fight against unemployment and the 
creation of new jobs, the introduction of government subsidies 
for fixing the price of bread and milk, free health care and 
education, higher education included, and the accessibility to 
each family of children's establishments, and so forth and will 
also oppose all attempts to further deprive the people of social 
safeguards. 
<H3>  V. Ways of Accomplishing the Tasks Set in the Election 
Platform of the Communist Party of Crimea </H3>
  The economic basis throughout the period of restoration 
should be a multistructural economy with the retention of the 
leading role of public property and state regulation of 
production. State regulation should provide for the extrication 
of the national economy from the severe economic crisis, and its 
multistructural character is a step toward the achievement of 
social harmony, of which we are in such need today, on the basis 
of a particular concurrence of the interests of the broadest 
strata of society: from the worker and employee through the 
national entrepreneur. A fundamental change in tax and credit 
policy for the purpose of stimulation of the producer of any 
form of ownership (private included) by way of concessionary 
taxation and lending with a simultaneous expansion of the tax 
and investment field, the establishment of government subsidies 
to agriculture and the elimination of the "price scissors" in 
respect to agricultural and industrial products, and furtherance 
of the development of both the kolkhozes and sovkhozes and 
tenant and private farms are necessary. 
  We will simultaneously conduct a merciless struggle against 
crime, corruption, and parasitic profiteering and oppose the 
introduction of the private ownership of land, which is the main 
wealth of Crimea and must not become a subject of speculation. 
The land and its resources are public property. It may be 
transferred, on a long-term and indefinite basis even, with 
transfer by inheritance, but without the right to buy and sell. 
  We will ensure effective state supervision of the activity 
of 
enterprises of all forms of ownership and restore renewed 
people's control. 
  The Communist Party is prepared to submit such a package of 
laws for consideration by the Supreme Soviet of Crimea. 
  Only the restoration of common statehood and an upturn of 
production will enable us to stabilize the economy, restore a 
decent living standard of the people, and secure acceptable 
starting conditions for the implementation of real reforms. 
  We have prepared and sent to the president of the Republic a 
"100 days" program, which is geared to the accomplishment of the 
priority tasks and which does not require big capital outlays. 
<H5>  VI. Strengthening the Power of the People </H5>
  As a guarantee of the preservation and strengthening of the 
state status of Crimea and the exclusion of the establishment of 
an authoritarian dictatorship, we see as the main task the 
broadening of the sovereignty of the soviets of all levels. 
  The chairmen of the city and rayon soviets should be elected 
directly by the public of the corresponding cities and rayons. 
  Consulting the people via a referendum should be the 
cardinal 
path of a solution of all strategic questions of the Republic's 
socioeconomic development. 
  Esteemed fellow citizens! 
  On 16 and 30 January 1994 you demonstrated high political 
maturity and expressed by your vote total lack of confidence in 
the power party. 
  But this political force remains a real obstacle in the way 
of the accomplishment of real social transformations in the 
interests of a majority of the people inasmuch as it has a 
majority in the Supreme Soviet and holds the key positions in 
the Council of Ministers of our republic. 
  For this reason we cannot allow to hold the mandates of 
deputies the representatives of that same power party, beneath 
whatever flags they have conducted their election campaign and 
in whatever "democratic" clothing they have garbed themselves. 
  Yours must be a deliberate choice!

<F P=106> [Report by V. Savchenko: "Poetry and Prose of Economics"] </F>
  [Text] It is not everyone who experiences in one day as 
many changes, significant ones at that, as have occurred for 
Yevgeniy Fedorovich Saburov. On Friday 11 March the Supreme 
Soviet of the Republic of Crimea appointed him vice premier of 
the Crimean Government. 
  Saburov's citizenship was simultaneously an issue at the 
session. N.V. Bagrov conveyed to the deputies the words of the 
representative of the president of Ukraine to the effect that he 
had no objection to Saburov's appointment to the office of vice 
prime minister of the Government of Crimea, but after [line 
missing] Ukraine. However, the deputies voted for the wording of 
Yu.A. Meshkov, president of the Republic of Crimea, in 
accordance with which Saburov will petition L.M. Kravchuk to be 
admitted to citizenship of Ukraine following his appointment to 
office. 
  Ye.F. Saburov held a news conference this day also. True, it 
had to be broken off after just a few minutes, and for a most 
serious reason. Journalists witnessed Yevgeniy Saburov writing 
the application requesting that he be granted citizenship of the 
state of Ukraine in connection with his appointment to the 
office of vice prime minister of the Government of the Republic 
of Crimea. 
  Saburov spent two hours altogether initially telling the 
session of his vision of the situation concerning reform of the 
economy of Crimea and then answering the questions of the 
deputies and, in conclusion, of journalists. 
  We have to yet fully recognize that a prominent economist 
who 
has held important positions in the Government of Russia and who 
has as of late been head of the Information and Social 
Technology Center under the auspices of the Government of the 
Russian Federation has become vice prime minster of the 
government. Now Ye.F. Saburov will have an opportunity to test 
his theoretical efforts in practice. 
  "I believe that Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, who said that it is 
impossible to work with a prompter, is right. If you are going 
to do something, you should do it yourself because your 
proposals become distorted to such an extent and are introduced 
so maladroitly that you are subsequently yourself ashamed of 
what you proposed." 
  Saburov is of a mind to change the "sinking ship" situation 
and to begin economic reforms. What does he need for this? 
Primarily, as he observed, a favorable political climate, but 
the situation in the Republic is complex and it could be a 
serious obstacle. 
  Second, serious changes in legislation are needed -- and not 
only this. Unless the legislative base keeps pace with the 
progress of the reforms, there will be breakdowns continually. 
Rule by decree was introduced in Russia to this end. The 
president of Crimea should have this right also. 
  And, third, the existence of a program worked out in detail 
down to the level: do this first, then do this. Thanks to the 
fact that it has been possible to enlist professional personnel, 
such a program will be put to the verdict of the inhabitants of 
Crimea in the very near future. 
  There is great experience of the generation of programs in 
the Council of Ministers of Crimea also. Sixteen have been 
compiled, but they have simply not been introduced. As a result 
Crimea is reminiscent in terms of reform of the Russia of 
1990-91. But on the other hand,this is, perhaps, good inasmuch 
as negative experience may be avoided. Of course, there would be 
greater confidence in the programs had the reforms produced 
results and improved people's lives on if only one territory of 
the former space of the Union. 
  To what extent does Crimea need ties to Russia? Saburov 
answered this question at the session twice, but a lady 
journalist from Canada put it more sharply: 
  "Many people regard your appointment merely as an attachment 
to Russia. What do you think?" 
  "The severance of ties to Russia has been quite tragic for 
the economy of Crimea. It is structured such as to be oriented 
toward sale of the product of goods and services. It is a 
question, therefore, not of some political convergence with 
Russia, but of the normal economic life of Crimea and the 
settlement of financial relations. Democratic countries should 
treat the express say of the people of Crimea with understanding 
and not seek in this an argument for confrontation and tension." 
  "But it is said that Crimea cannot live without Ukraine 
either?" was a question put by a Ukrainian journalist. 
  "There is the question of dependence and there is the 
question of orientation. When it is a question of a close 
connection with Ukraine, this is true, and it is, indeed, 
impossible for Crimea to be a `Crimean Island,' however good 
Aksenov's similarly entitled book may be. Both the North Crimean 
Canal and questions of power engineering are closely connected 
with Ukraine. As far as orientation is concerned, the industrial 
product should be sold in Russia, and the agricultural product 
geared to the north. Recreation is oriented toward Russia also. 
  "In the severance of ties between Russia and Ukraine the 
former is no less to blame than Ukraine, and the inhabitants of 
Crimea do not understand this, unfortunately." 
  "There will be no miracle," Saburov uttered these words more 
than once during his meetings in the two different auditoriums, 
and they applied mainly to the hopes linked with Russia. Thus, 
there is no point expecting lines of credit of the Central Bank 
of Russia. Saburov's team is attempting settle this question, 
but a great deal of difficult work has to be done. 
  Where are the most painful spots in Crimea, what will be the 
starting point for the work? 
  Saburov believes that it is necessary first of all to change 
the status of the Central Bank of Crimea. It must have the right 
if only to register foreign banks. In this case banking in 
Crimea could begin to flourish. And this would be a base for all 
the rest. 
  There is, in addition, the question of privatization. It 
would be better to undertake it in accordance with a special 
program, and applying the German plan would be best, Saburov 
believes. 
  A revision of the tax system brooks no delay. The one in 
effect currently has stifled the producer and shrunk the tax 
base. 
  Summing up this topic, Saburov said told the deputies that 
there was not a clause of the program that could be put off 
until later. It will be necessary to do many things 
simultaneously both in terms of operational management and 
strategic direction. Budget and currency regulation are 
essential. It is disadvantageous to Crimea's enterprises to 
offer their products for export. 
  Judging by the fact that Saburov condemns the actions of 
Gaydar, who failed to notify the people of his program, Crimeans 
will be kept sufficiently informed as to the government's 
actions pertaining to emergence from the crisis situation. The 
reforms, incidentally, need to be implemented strictly, rapidly, 
and intelligently, Saburov believes. Not experiments on people, 
but reforms in the name of man. 
  Today the whole government of the Republic has resigned, and 
although Saburov has said that 99.9 percent of the entire former 
machinery of the Council of Ministers matches the required 
standard, this is hard to believe. The vice prime minister 
wishes to see henceforward a more professional government. It 
will include also specialists from Moscow invited by the vice 
premier into the "key" offices. But the vice prime minister has 
just as many questions and uncertainties as the journalists. 
  The participants in the news conference put questions on 
more 
than just the economy. They inquired as to where the vice prime 
minister would be living, what his horoscope sign is, and what 
he does in his spare time. Studies economics, apparently, but he 
sometimes writes poetry, not having time for prose. He was never 
a member of the Communist Party and is devoutly religious. 
  It is believed, as we all know, that by fall.... A 
negligible 
amount of time, to be frank, for the implementation of an 
economic program, but there are to have been changes in Crimea 
by this time. Certainty and awareness of his responsibility are 
Saburov's most compelling features.

  [Text] The Green Party of Ukraine and the Ukrainian 
ecological association "Green World" held a news conference on 
18 March dedicated to the issue of the ecologically dangerous 
enterprises in Kiev. These, in particular, are plants "Radykal" 
[Radical], "Khimvolokno" [Chemical Fiber], TE-6, as well as 
automobile transport and the radioactive contamination of the 
capital as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear 
power station. 
  The news conference was attended by Green Party Chairman 
Vitaliy Kononov, Yuriy Samoylenko, first deputy chairman of the 
Ukrainian ecological association "Green World", Serhiy 
Konyukhov, the chairman of the Ecological Commission of the 
Ukrainian Republican Party, Mykhaylo Mykhalko, the chairman of 
the "Save Holosiyevo" Union [woodland on outskirts of Kiev], and 
others. Anatoliy Panov, the executive director of the newspaper 
ZELENYY SVIT [GREEN WORLD], expressed his conviction that the 
"hushing up of the fact that Kiev did suffer as a result of the 
accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station is not just a 
detrimental, but a criminal phenomenon. If our state has no 
money to provide medical treatment to Kievites and improve their 
health, this money could be provided by the world public." 
  At the news conference, Greenpeace-Ukraine made public its 
press release disclosing a secret decree No. 64/94 by Ukraine's 
president of 23 February 1994 "On urgent measures to develop 
nuclear power engineering and create a nuclear-fuel cycle in 
Ukraine." The decree, in particular, envisages the 
commissioning of four new reactors at the Zaporozhye, 
Khmelnitskiy, and Rovno nuclear power stations and also the 
repair and putting into operation of the second power unit at 
the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which was ruined by fire in 
October 1991.

"Reactor Shut Down at Khmelnitskiy Atomic Electric Power 
Station"] 
  [Text] A rather serious incident happened on 16 March at 
Khmelnitskiy Atomic Electric Power Station [AES] on the 
territory of now independent Ukraine. Your SEGODNYA 
correspondent was told in Russia's State Committee for the 
Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor] with 
reference to information from the Swiss headquarters of the 
NucNet European Nuclear Society (based on the information from 
Ukraine's State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and 
Radiation Safety) that the events at the AES unfolded as follows: 
  At 2100 local time, a power cable of 0.4 kilovolts ignited 
in 
the engine room of the first reactor. The firemen put out the 
fire at 2110. Despite that the chiefs decided to discontinue 
the generator's operation and it was shut down. Ukraine's State 
Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety 
rated this incident grade 1 on the seven-point INES scale. 
  Commenting on this occurrence, Yuriy Rogozhin, press service 
head of the Russian State Committee for the Supervision of 
Nuclear and Radiation Safety, stated in an interview with your 
SEGODNYA correspondent that a rather dubious situation prevails 
in CIS nuclear power engineering. For example, the Russian 
State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety had received information about the accident at 
Khmelnitskiy AES through the channels of foreign news agencies. 
This despite an agreement on exchanging information about this 
sort of occurrences signed between the two committees in 1992. 
The agreement was sealed at the intergovernment level a year 
later. Incidentally, as this issue went to print the Russian 
counterparts had not been alerted to the Khmelnitskiy incident 
by Ukraine's State Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and 
Radiation Safety.

  [Text] Deputies of the State Duma elected in one-mandate 
constituencies again failed to include an amendment to the 
Duma's draft regulations to make rights equal to those of party 
factions. 
  According to the present regulations, only deputy groups 
numbering at least 35 members are eligible for official 
registration. The official registration gives such a group the 
right to be represented in the Council of the State Duma and all 
rights of party factions. 
  So far only one deputy group, New Regional Policy, with 65 
out of the 219 deputies elected in one-mandate constituencies, 
has been officially registered. Thus, a large number of 
deputies are not represented in the Council of the State Duma. 
Two deputy groups -- December 12 (leaders Irina Khakamada, 
Aleksandr Braginskiy and Yevgeniy Bushmin) and Russian Way 
(leaders Sergey Baburin and Anatoliy Lukyanov) do not have the 
required number of deputies. 
  During the discussion of the corresponding amendment to the 
regulations of the State Duma, Chairman of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDPR] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said that his 
faction will support this amendment only in exchange for the 
introduction of the so-called "imperative mandate" which will 
give the faction the right to deprive any deputy elected on the 
party ticket of the deputy mandate. 
  "It is not possible for a party to get rid of criminals," 
Zhirinovskiy said. As is known, lately two deputies, Viktor 
Kobelev and Aleksandr Pronin, have left the LDPR faction because 
of disagreement with the leader of the faction. 
  The leader of the December 12 deputy group Khakamada 
stressed 
in her speech that the refusal to register their group means 
violation of equal rights of the deputies and the aggravation of 
conflict inside the Duma. 
  Sergey Baburin (Russian Way) in turn spoke against the 
imperative mandate because, in his opinion, "each deputy should 
be free in voting," and "the discipline in the faction should be 
established by persuasion, not by whip." 
  In respone Zhirinovskiy accused Baburin of "already having 
led one parliament to being shot" and demanded that he should 
not interfere in the internal affairs of the party. 
  Nevertheless, a majority could not be found to support any 
of 
the variants of the corresponding article in the regulations. A 
package proposed by Zhirinovskiy also failed to get a majority 
of votes. So, the article determining the number of deputy 
groups required for official registration was sent for 
elaboration to the working group.

Aleksandr Pochinok, deputy chairman of the budget committee, 
said there are no major divergences from the original version. 
The deficit has risen from 61.2 trillion rubles to 62.4 
trillion. This is due to a minor increase in the budget's 
expenditure allocations. Aleksandr Pochinok noted that the 
budget is fairly tough and the deficit is completely acceptable. 
At the same time he stressed that the government is again 
trying, via budgetary laws, to change the tax legislation.

  [Text] Huseyin Atak, the governor of Kars Province, paid a 
visit to Gyumri on 17 March at the invitation of Andranik 
Kocharyan, Armenian Government's plenipotentiary representative 
in Shirak [region around town of Gyumri]. 
  In a news conference on 18 March, Kocharyan spoke about the 
governor's visit and noted that this was the first step after a 
long intermission on the way to establishing cooperation and 
good-neighborly relations with the neighboring province. He 
stressed that the talks basically centered on the organization 
of border trade, restoration of rail traffic, implementation of 
mutually- advantageous economic programs, and improvements in 
the tourism industry. The development of ties with the 
neighboring country would [words indistinct]. And everything 
must be done to raise cooperation between Shirak and Kars 
Province to a new level.

talks were preliminary in nature and touched upon purely 
economic issues.

for 
cooperation in diverse fields will be presented to the Turkish

  [Text] Yerevan, March 18 (SNARK)--Russia must become the 
guarantee of recognition of the republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, 
Nikolay Lysenko, the chairman of the National-Republican Party 
of Russia, said today in Yerevan. Commenting the results of the 
visit to Stepanakert, Lysenko said "According to the 
international regulations Karabakh has a right to establish 
sovereign republic." 
  On his words Armenia, Russia, Karabakh are connected by 
geographical strategic interests. He said "the policy, pursued 
by Turkey in Transcaucasia, must be considered as directed 
against Russia. The aggression of Azerbaijan against Karabakh 
wouldn't be possible if Turkey didn't support Azerbaijan." 
According to him there are a few people in the State Duma that 
agree with national-republicans in the question concerning to 
Armenia and Karabakh. Today the delegation of 
National-republican party leave for Moscow.

  [Text] Armenia wishes the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to be 
settled through negotiations involving not only Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh and Russia but also European 
nations and the United States, an Armenian statesman said. 
  But such talks must be preceded by an unconditional 
ceasefire, Ara Saakian, first deputy chairman of the Armenian 
parliament, told INTERFAX on Sunday. 
  Today both Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan are making 
preliminary conditions, the former pressing for a ceasefire and 
a certain legal status for itself, the latter demanding that 
Nagorno-Karabakh withdraw its troops from Azerbaijani 
territories they occupy, Saakian said. 
  He said Armenia "is building great hopes" on Russia's 
mediation. 
  Meanwhile, disagreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan last 
week prevented the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly meeting in 
St. Petersburg from passing an appeal against the imposition of 
a transport or energy blockade by one Commonwealth state against 
another. Azerbaijani delegation leader Afiyaddin Dzhalilov 
insisted that the appeal include a provision for a mechanism for 
liberating the 20 percent of Azerbaijani lands occupied by 
Nagorno-Karabakh forces and for bringing back home the more than 
a million Azerbaijani refugees.

  [Text] For the time being it is too early to discuss who 
will go to Brussels and when to sign the NATO program 
Partnership for Peace on behalf of Russia, First Deputy Defense 
Minister of the Russian Federation Andrey Kokoshin told 
reporters on Friday. 
  He said that Mr. Perry's visit to Russia focused on 
bilateral 
relations in the military/political sphere. In particular, the 
two sides discussed the implementation of the air-defense 
treaty, ban on nuclear testing and non-proliferation of nuclear 
arms. 
  "Russia and the U.S. are particularly responsible for 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, because they are two major 
nuclear powers. We should not focus all of our attention on the 
NATO program Partnership for Peace. It is just "an element" of 
relations between Russia and the West. Partnership For Peace 
should be understood in a broad sense," Kokoshin said. 
  In his opinion, "one should approach Russia's entry in this 
program very seriously." "The interests of Russia and its allies 
under the CIS treaty on collective security should be fully 
taken into account," Kokoshin said.

  [Text] The practical aspects of cooperation between Russia 
and the United States in questions concerning the conversion of 
the defense industry and nuclear disarmament were the main theme 
of the talks between Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry 18 March in Moscow. In 
particular, projects to supply American technologies for the 
construction of residential accommodation in Russia, including 
accommodation for servicemen, were discussed. After all, the 
head of the Russian Government, along with American Vice 
President Albert Gore, is co-chairman of the commission for 
economic and scientific-technical cooperation between our 
countries, and also for implementing the conversion of military 
production. 
  A meeting involving Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation 
first 
deputy defense minister, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, and 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry took place 18 March. 
  At the meeting, the discussion of the issues examined at the 
meeting on the previous day between Russian Federation Army 
General Pavel Grachev and William Perry was continued. In 
particular, talk centered on the reinforcement of the ABM 
Treaty, the eradication of chemical weapons, the halting of 
nuclear explosions by all countries possessing nuclear weapons, 
and the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation. 
  On the previous day there had been meetings with Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and later, in the State Duma,

  [Text] Moscow March 19 TASS - The Russian Foreign Ministry 
released the following statement on Saturday. 
  "On March 18 the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution 
denouncing the massacre in Hebron and providing for a set of 
measures to ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians in the 
occupied territories. 
  "Russia, from the very beginning of the discussion of the 
resolution in the Security Council, had been calling for its 
soonest possible adoption, considering it as a crucial step for 
normalising the situation in the Middle East and resuming 
Arab-Israeli talks. 
  "The initiating steps taken by the Russian cosponsor -- 
personal address by President Boris Yeltsin to the leaders of 
Israel and the PLO, a trip by the foreign minister to Israel and 
Tunisia, a series of contacts by Russian special representatives 
in the region and energetic efforts in the Security Council -- 
not only facilitated the adoption of an effective resolution, 
but also laid the foundation for further progress in the Middle 
East peace process. 
  "Russia, together and parallelly with the American 
cosponsor, 
intends to continue the active political line in the Middle 
East, including in accordance with the provisions of the adopted 
resolution and is ready to do its best to implement the U.N. 
Security Council resolution on Hebron, as well as promote the 
soonest possible agreement between Israel and Palestinians and 
its fulfillment. This would provide opportunities in other 
directions of the Arab-Israeli dialogue and near the time of 
establishing a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle 
East."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin and Vitaliy </F>
Chukseyev] 
  [Text] Washington, 19 Mar -- Vitaliy Churkin, Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister and the Russian president's special 
envoy, has described the agreements concluded here on the 
formation of a Muslim-Croat Bosnian federation as important, but 
only the very first steps in a peaceful settlement of the 
Bosnian conflict. He attended Friday's White House ceremony at 
which the documents were signed. Alija Izetbegovic, president 
of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman, and Kresimir Zubak, a representative of the Bosnian 
Croats, appended their signatures to the documents. 
  On the same day Churkin arranged a news conference, at which 
he declared that the agreement on a new Muslim-Croat state 
formation, and especially the agreement on arranging 
confederative ties between it and Croatia were of an interim 
nature. It was a vital condition for a true settlement in 
Bosnia that it preserved its territorial integrity and that the 
Bosnian Serbs, therefore, took part in the peace process, the 
high-ranking Russian diplomat explained. 
  Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent about 
whether the agreement on confederative relations between the new 
federation and Croatia might be an obstacle to the inclusion of 
the Serbs within the federation, Churkin said: I don't think 
so, since the agreement on a confederation with Croatia is of an 
interim nature. Equally interim is the agreement on the 
formation of the actual federation. In other words, both 
documents may be changed if the Bosnian Serbs decide to become 
involved in implementing them. I am sure that the Serbs will 
demand some changes that will be in keeping with their views on 
the future Bosnia. The Russian deputy foreign minister pointed 
out that the territorial contradictions constituted one of the 
main issues dividing the opposing sides today. 
  Churkin stressed the major role that is currently being 
played in the process of settling the Bosnian conflict by 
American and Russian diplomacy. He noted that the two 
countries' interests in this respect were not opposed in 
principle. He said that evidence of this was provided by the 
praise for Russia's efforts that was expressed at the signing 
ceremony by U.S. President Bill Clinton. Equally high praise for 
Moscow's policy was forthcoming at the meeting that took place 
on the same day with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  During the visit by the Russian president's special envoy to 
the American capital, he also had a conversation with German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. He held consultations with 
Charles Redman, the American special envoy on Yugoslavia, and 
met David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the co-chairmen of the 
peace process in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Churkin told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that Russian 
diplomacy would continue to play an active part in settling the 
Bosnian conflict. He announced that he was flying on 19 March 
to Zagreb to have further talks and to organize a meeting 
between the sides, which are planned for the Russian Embassy on 
25 March.

  [Text] Zagreb, 20 Mar -- "The U.S. leadership has confirmed 
at the highest level its preparedness to cooperate with Russia 
in the settlement of the crisis in former Yugoslavia," Vitaliy 
Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president, said upon 
arrival in the Croatian capital from Washington on Sunday. 
  "I had talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, U.S. 
Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher, and Vice President Albert Gore. 
During the talks with Christopher we discussed the main 
directions of our joint work and agreed that the United States 
and Russia will work with all sides involved in the conflict," 
Churkin said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  "In Washington, we discussed the most likely date for a 
meeting between all Bosnian sides. I believe that this meeting 
could be held as early as next week," Churkin said. 
  "Everyone supports our initiative in holding this meeting 
and 
hopes that the signing of the cease-fire agreement will be 
followed by further productive steps. But now what is mainly 
being said is that it is necessary to nudge the sides to the 
conclusion of this agreement to conclude the months of talks. 
Stressing as I do the strengthening of our cooperation with the 
United States, I also invited the U.S. ambassador in Croatia to 
take part in the Zagreb meeting," Churkin said. 
  Vladimir Ivanovskiy, head of the Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry department for the countries of former Yugoslavia, who 
is in Zagreb, commenting on Russia's approach to the 
Croatian-Serbian settlement process, told the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent today that the Croat leadership's talks with the 
local Serbs should, judging by everything, take place in three 
stages. 
  The first, if circumstances are favorable, could be 
completed 
by 22 March with the signing of a cease-fire agreement and end 
to hostilities. The draft agreement envisages demarcation of 
lines of the Croatian and Serbian forces, withdrawal of heavy 
weapons from a 20-km security zone, and a number of other 
measures. 
  After this talks could begin on restoration of economic and 
transport links with the territories under Serbian control. 
  Political questions including the status of the Serb 
Krajinas 
should, as the most difficult aspect, be left to the third stage 
of a settlement, the Russian diplomat said.

  [Text] Zagreb, 21 Mar -- Participants in the talks between 
government delegations of Croatia and the Serb Republic of 
Krajina due to open at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on Tuesday 
will strive toward an agreement on stopping hostilities 
immediately. 
  The talks, which are to be resumed, as is known, at the 
initiative of the Russian side, will be based on a draft 
agreement on a cease-fire drawn up by specialists from UN 
peace-making forces. The Croat delegation is expected to be led 
by Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the republic's security service, and 
the Serb delegation by Rear Admiral Dusan Rakic, defense 
minister of the Serb Republic of Krajina which Croatia does not 
recognize. Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian 
president, the Russian and U.S. ambassadors in Croatia as well 
as officials from UN peace-making forces and the international 
conference on former Yugoslavia are to attend the talks as 
mediators. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from trustworthy 
sources in Zagreb that the basic content of the draft agreement 
boils down to the following: 
  - The sides agree to cease armed operations forthwith and 
also to cease fire on all lines of contact as of a date to be 
agreed; 
  - The tactical deployment of the armed forces which are 
situated along the line of contact and within a radius of 10 km 
in all directions relative to the line of contact will be frozen 
on the day the agreement is signed and movement of military 
units and sub-units will be banned; 
  - All targetable weapons will be deployed outside the 
region of the line of contact: mortars and antiaircraft guns at 
least 10 km and artillery and tanks at least 20 km; 
  - All sub-units to be withdrawn from the line of contact 
by at least 1,000 meters; 
  - Observance of the cease-fire is to be monitored by the 
UNPROFOR and the EC observer mission; 
  - Joint commissions are being set up at all levels and 
their main task is to mark the terrain where the sides' 
disengagement lines are situated and to investigate any 
cease-fire violations; 
  - A certain number of checkpoints will be opened along the 
entire line of contact. Conditions for the joint commissions to 
meet at the checkpoints will be created. 
  A separate point treats the need for the sides to meet to 
discuss the conditions for the reduction of the armed forces 
within the 10 km security zone. 
  On the eve of the talks Vitaliy Churkin is holding intensive 
consultations in Zagreb with the highest UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] officials and with representatives of the international 
conference on the former Yugoslavia.

"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister and 
deputy prime minister, has arrived in Moscow on a three-day 
visit. During meetings with the head of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry and other leaders, Hata is going to discuss a wide 
range of issues. Firstly, long-standing disputes over the Kuril 
Islands, which cause great anxiety on the part of the Japanese 
side in light of the recent statement by Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin, that there is no territorial problem between our 
two countries. Hata also wants to discuss Russia' policy in the 
former Yugoslavia in greater detail, economic cooperation 
issues, and the possibility of Russia joining G7 -- the minister 
is very reserved regarding the latter. 
  Before departure, Hata admitted frankly that he was going to 
ask Russia's assistance in settling the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula. To all appearances, Marshall Kim Il-song continues 
to develop nuclear weapons, and the pressure exerted by South 
Korea and the United States is evidently insufficient. All 
these issues will be discussed tomorrow when the six-hour time 
lag between Moscow and Tokyo will not be affecting the minister 
so strongly. Today, Hata laid a wreath at the Grave of the 
Unknown soldier and visited the Moscow State University and the 
Morozov hospital. [video shows a press conference, aerial

  [Text] Moscow, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata criticized North Korea on Sunday over its suspected 
nuclear arms development plan, saying Pyongyang is taking a 
stubborn attitude. 
  Hata, speaking to reporters in Moscow, said North Korea's 
tough attitude led to the breakdown of the eighth round of 
working-level inter-Korean talks Saturday. 
  "It is regrettable that the (dialogue) broke down because of 
North Korea's stubborn attitude," he said. 
  The foreign minister, who is on a four-day visit to Russia 
starting Saturday, urged North Korea to respond to serious 
concern among the international community about its nuclear 
development program. He also asked Pyongyang to hold sincere 
talks with South Korea. 
  On Saturday, delegates of North and South Korea met in the 
truce village of Panmunjom for 55 minutes to discuss procedures 
for an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys between Seoul and 
Pyongyang. But the session produced little progress, failing 
even to set a date for the next round. The talks collapsed with 
North Korean negotiators walking away from the dialogue table, 
south officials said.

  [Text] This morning the Russian premier met with Tsutomu 
Hata, the Japanese minister of foreign affairs. Participants in 
the meeting said that possible projects for economic cooperation 
were the main topic discussed at the talks. In addition, 
political aspects of Russian-Japanese relations were discussed. 
This is what Viktor Chernomyrdin said in response to a question 
about the Northern Territories and what Tsutomu Hata replied to 
a question about the possibility of Russia joining the G-7. 
  [Begin recording] [Chernomyrdin] We did not discuss this 
matter in detail but we did touch on it in principle: that we 
need to conclude a peace treaty between Russia and Japan and 
that, naturally, the issue relating to the territories is one 
that we will study. So, we will be acting without haste on 
this. This issue cannot be settled hurriedly. There is an 
accord reached following the president's visit. I believe we 
will continue to act in future within the framework of this 
understanding. 
  [Hata in Japanese, with superimposed Russian translation] 
Regarding the issue of Russia joining the G-7, this issue should 
be examined within the framework of the G-7 countries. Since we 
know that Russia plays a very important role in the political 
life of the international community, including in the issue of 
the former Yugoslavia, I think we should therefore continue in 
future to have close contacts with Russia. But if one is to 
talk categorically about this issue, then ultimately it is 
Italy's turn this year to be the country which chairs the G-7. 
So, it is Italy that can play the chief role in deciding this 
matter. But, nevertheless, bearing in mind the major role which 
Russia plays in the international community, I think we should 
have close contacts in future with Russia on this matter. [end

  [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- The foreign ministers of 
Russia and Japan have agreed to raise the level of cooperation 
between the two countries in the field of economic interaction, 
Andrey Kozyrev said after the end of official negotiations with 
his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata, who is also Japan's 
vice-premier. 
  Andrey Kozyrev said he and his Japanese opposite number had 
had "a detailed, circumstantial and constructive conversation 
covering a wide range of bilateral problems and some 
international issues". 
  On the initiative of the Japanese side, the question about 
the peace treaty between the two countries, including the 
territorial issue, was touched upon. "We are not eschewing this 
problem," the Russian minister said. According to him, these 
questions will be discussed in detail during bilateral 
negotiations on the basis of the Tokyo declaration signed during 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. 
  The Japanese minister was handed over a message from Boris 
Yeltsin to Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in which 
the Russian president expresses the desire to see the head of 
the Japanese government arrive for a visit to Moscow as soon as 
possible. 
  Tsutumu Hata said the Russian president's message was "very 
amiable". He said the prompt signing of a peace treaty and the 
solution to the territorial dispute would be in the interests of 
better bilateral relations. He noted that popular support was 
needed for the solution in both countries. 
  Tsutomu Hata confirmed Tokyo's readiness to assist Russian 
reforms in all ways. He said Japan intended to cooperate with 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 
establishing a 50 million dollar fund to support Russia's small- 
and medium- sized businesses. 
  Asked about Japan's stance on turning the Group of Seven 
into 
a group of eight by adopting Russia as a full-fledged member, 
Andrey Kozyrev said Japan's reaction was "quite encouraging".

  [Text] Moscow, 21 March -- Strengthening and maintaining 
the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, including 
IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections, is a 
fundamental issue for Russia, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev stated today after talks with Tsutomu Hata, Japanese 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister. 
  Answering questions from journalists about whether there was 
discussion at their meeting of the problems regarding steps 
Moscow might take in regard to Pyongyang, which is suspected of 
developing nuclear weapons, the Russian minister said: "We 
shall firmly insist upon fulfilment of all necessary obligations 
and procedures." The forms in which this issue might be 
settled, he pointed out, are now being discussed at bilateral 
negotiations and the relevant consultations are under way, 
including through IAEA channels. "I think we shall be acting 
with Japan very closely, as well as with other partners," Andrey 
Kozyrev stressed.

  [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- Russia and Japan are of the 
same opinion about the current "alarming situation" around the 
North Korean nuclear problem which may become still more 
serious, Aleksandr Panov, deputy foreign minister of the Russian 
Federation, told ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview after the 
talks between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and 
Tsutomu Hata, deputy premier and foreign minister of Japan, in 
Moscow today. 
  According to Aleksandr Panov, Moscow and Tokyo stand for 
strengthening of the regime of nuclear non-proliferation and for 
the Korean Peninsular becoming a nuclear-free zone. Both sides, 
he noted, consider it necessary to maintain a constant mutual 
contact, continue negotiations on the nuclear problem of North 
Korea, and probably look for some other approaches as the 
present ones proved to be insufficiently effective. 
  Asked about what joint contribution Moscow and Tokyo could 
make to the ensuring of security in the Far East and in the 
Asian-Pacific region as a whole, the Russian senior diplomat 
said both sides had earlier expressed the coincidence of views 
on this problem. 
  Russia and Japan consider it important, while maintaining 
the 
existing treaties and agreements, to move towards cooperation on 
a subregional level. The Russian Foreign Ministry believes that 
such a subregional mechanism could be created in particular in 
the basin of the Sea of Japan.

  [Text] Russia and Japan agree that their territorial 
dispute should be solved "step by step taking the Tokyo 
declaration as a basis," Japanese Vice Prime Minister, Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata commented on the results of his visit to 
Moscow. 
  As the main result of his visit, Hata pointed out the two 
sides' proven commitment to preserve Russo-Japanese relations on 
the level achieved after Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo last October 
and strictly observe the provisions of the Tokyo declaration 
signed during the visit. 
  Hata pointed out that his present visit to Russia had 
produced a number of openings which could lead to a conducive 
environment for the resolution of the territorial issue. In 
particular, the contacts between Japan and the four disputed 
islands will be further enhanced. 
  The Japanese minister said he was satisfied with Russia's 
commitment to the course of reforms. "The main thing now is to 
train personnel for the future Russian economy. This is why we 
agreed on Japan constructing a business college at Moscow 
University and setting up a Japanese management center there," 
Hata was quoted as saying. He also said the Japanese government 
planned to set aside $50 Mn to stimulate Russia's privatized 
businesses. Hata pointed out that Russia and Japan had 
exchanged opinions on a wide range of global-scale issues. 
"Russia has proved its weight in international affairs, and its 
involvement in the resolution of international issues is very 
important," Hata said. 
  According to the Japanese minister, the two sides reached a 
principal agreement to hold permanent consultations on defense 
and security issues. 
  Commenting on North Korea's refusal to admit IAEA experts 
and 
its threat to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the 
Japanese minister pointed out that he had touched on the issue 
during his talk with his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, 
and that he could confidently establish that the two countries 
were unanimous on the issue. Hata added that both Russia and 
Japan were deeply concerned over the North Korean issue, and "we 
demand this country admit IAEA experts and resume exchange of 
envoys with South Korea."

  [Text] United Nations March 18 TASS -- Russia raised the 
question of lifting oil embargo against Iraq at today's 
closed-door consultative meeting of the United Nations Security 
Council, which discussed sanctions against Baghdad. 
  "Russia said that certain positive changes have recently 
occurred in Baghdad actions which testify to its intention to 
fulfill disarmament aspects of Resolution 687 and long-term 
control measures of Resolution 715," Russian permanent 
representative to the United Nations Yuliy Vorontsov told 
ITAR-TASS today. 
  In the words of Vorontsov, "the Russian delegation thinks 
that positive changes in the Iraqi stand should be encouraged". 
Bearing this in mind, Russia suggested to include in a 
statement of the Security Council president a provision on 
positive changes in Iraqi actions. 
  The Russian delegation also voiced the need for the "soonest 
agreement on the date to begin the fulfilment of long-term 
monitoring plans and duration of the 'control period' for 
estimation of its efficiency. 
  "If upon the completion of this period, say six months, 
Iraqi 
honest comprehensive fulfilment of obligations is confirmed, 
Russia will be ready to discuss the lift of oil embargo in 
accordance with paragraph 22 of Resolution 687". 
  The Russian delegation thinks Iraq should immediately 
recognize sovereignty and borders of Kuwait.

  [Text] Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is back in Moscow 
after his visit to Kaliningrad. But as has become known, his 
visit should have continued today as well. Our correspondent 
reports on details of this unexpected change in the program. 
  [Correspondent Sablin] Baltiysk, the town of naval seamen, 
has already gotten used to visits by prominent guests. But 
nevertheless, one could describe the latest visit there by 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev as historic; in a few 
days the fate of the oldest navy of Russia will be decided at a 
collegium of the Military Department. 
  It seems that the minister already has his own opinion: the 
Baltic Navy, even after reduction by 40 percent, should remain 
the main core of the defense area which is being set up in the 
Western part of the country. The second important point of the 
program of Pavel Grachev's visit to Kaliningrad Oblast was the 
settlement of social problems of servicemen who were withdrawn 
from the Baltic countries. But the minister did not manage to 
solve the complex of problems on construction of accommodation 
because of extraordinary, almost detective-story circumstances. 
Literally the day before, the special services of Lithuania 
arrested Vladas Laurinavicius, the head of the "Selma" firm in 
Kaunas. This is the firm which is building blocks of apartments 
for Russian servicemen. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] This action was planned. Our 
conversation with him and all that happened after this 
conversation was monitored. I am the author of this project and 
the matter is that in essence "Selma" worked with its own money, 
so to say, on credit, and they were patiently waiting for us to 
pay them. Moreover, Vladas was informed that I would bring 
instructions from the prime minister concerning conditions of 
payment. I brought them a barter deal, as it were. We should 
have paid him in oil as we agreed. You know, these instruction 
are here, in my case, but I cannot give them to him. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] This is some kind of a detective story which has 
made the problem of accommodation for the servicemen even more 
difficult.

  [Text] The dumping of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of 
Japan by vessels of the Pacific Fleet may be carried out only if 
permitted by the Russian Government. An ITAR-TASS correspondent 
learned this at the press center of the Russian Navy when he 
asked the center to comment on a report published in Japan's 
MAINICHI. Citing the head of the chemical service of the 
Pacific Fleet, Valeriy Danilyan, the newspaper wrote that Russia 
may resume the discharge of the waste in the Sea of Japan in May 
this year if foreign countries, including Japan, fail to provide 
financial aid for building special units. The press center of 
the Russian Navy said that this is just a personal opinion of 
one of the commanders of the Pacific Fleet. The Russian 
Government has made no decision concerning the dumping of 
nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan.

  [Text] Prague, March 19 (TASS) -- Vladimir Zhirinovsky has 
postponed his visit to the czech capital for an indefinite time, 
the CTK NEWS AGENCY reported. The visit was to begin on Sunday. 
  At the beginning of the week, when staying in Warsaw, the 
chairman of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) 
announced plans to make a two-day visit to the Czech Republic. 
However, the party leader "probably made a mistake", an LDPR 
spokesman told CTK. As it turns out, it is necessary for 
Zhirinovsky to address intra- party affairs, which will require 
his presence in Moscow on Sunday and Monday. 
  A decision to postpone the visit was taken after LDPR 
representatives' consultations with the staff of the Czech 
Embassy in Moscow. 
  Earlier Prague had made it clear that it considers 
Zhirinovsky's planned visit as highly undesirable. In 
particular, Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml stated an intention 
to make every possible step to prevent the LDPR leader from 
visiting the country.

condolences to the families of those who have been killed and 
prayed that they maintain patience. 
  According to the statement, a special group made up of 
several air force personnel will leave for Armenia to

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and on 
the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  The significant decrease in the number of combat operations 
at the NKR's front lines during the past few days should not be 
taken to mean that tension has subsided. Regrettably, 
instability continues to exist. The reason for this state of 
affairs is the systematic firing on the Armenian defense 
positions by Azerbaijan's military forces and the concentration 
of Azerbaijani reinforcements and military vehicles in areas 
close to the front. This is not the first time that 
Azerbaijan's military command has used the relatively peaceful 
situation to organize wide-scale attacks. Although the enemy has 
agreed to hold talks to resolve the dispute, it has not 
abandoned its military operations. 
  It is a fact that the talks held between the chairmen of the 
parliaments of the two sides was a hope-inspiring development. 
However, it is difficult to predict the outcome of their talks. 
The latest reports we have received from the NKR Defense 
Headquarters have confirmed our viewpoint. 
  NKR advance positions in Agdamskiy, Martuninskiy, and 
Fizulinskiy Rayons were fired on with various types of arms from 
Azerbaijan's military bases in Fizulinskiy and Agdzhabedinskiy 
Rayons the night before last. The Armenian defensive positions 
in Yusifdzhanly, Novruzlu, and Egerly in Agdamskiy Rayon were 
fired on with various types of arms from the military bases in 
Agdzhabedinskiy and Agdamskiy Rayons. No one was wounded in the 
incidents. 
  The Azerbaijan Military Command Headquarters has used its 
air 
force units once again. Two enemy aircraft tried to bomb 
Stepanakert at about 1020 yesterday. The NKR air defense forces 
took retaliatory measures. The first reports we received said 
that one of the aircraft was hit and downed near Dashbulakh in 
Askeranskiy Rayon. We recall that one of Azerbaijan's aircraft 
was destroyed in NKR's airspace nearly a month ago. Obviously, 
the losses suffered by Azerbaijan's air force units have 
increased. 
  The situation on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan 
continues to be tense. However, serious clashes and exchanges 
of fire have not occurred. The situation can be described as 
relatively peaceful.

  [Text] Zhirair Liparityan, Armenian first deputy foreign 
minister, made a statement to reporters today in connection with 
the [Iranian] plane crash. Mr. Liparityan said: 
  [Begin Liparityan recording] You might have already heard 
that last night an Iranian C-130 aircraft flying from Moscow to 
Tehran deviated by some 100 km from its established path for 
unknown reasons after crossing Georgian airspace. It did not 
enter the Armenian zone. It appears that it entered Azerbaijani 
airspace and then was involved in an accident 14 km from 
Stepanakert. It is not clear what happened. The only thing we 
know is that at around 2200 Tbilisi informed our air traffic 
controllers that the plane would enter Armenian airspace at 
2208. But, in fact it did not. A search started after that. 
The accident involving the Iranian aircraft took place at 
around 2230. Even this is not clear. In addition to the crew, 
civilians were also on board. The exact number is not clear. 
There should have been 13 crewmen. There were also others. 
[words indistinct] Probably some 30, 31 people. 
  We had no direct involvement with this incident because the 
plane was not in contact with us. But we are already providing 
every assistance to the Iranian Embassy and Government to 
facilitate the solution of the problems arising from this 
incident. I can only add that there is clear information that 
plane was experiencing technical difficulties; defects, 
technical defects. 
  This is all we know. And no one can say anything more 
definite than this. 
  Sorry, I will not reply to your questions today. Everything 
we know for certain I conveyed to you. Thank you. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 19 Mar -- Representatives of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran have started work at the site of the crash of 
the Iranian C-130 Hercules military transport plane. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic told an ITAR-TASS correspondent by telephone today that 
the republic's authorities had expressed condolences to the 
families of those who died and to the Iranian people. A state 
commission to investigate the cause of the air crash has been 
set up. 
  According to reports from other Karabakh sources, local 
experts do not rule out the possibility that the Iranian plane 
could have been shot down by the Azerbaijani side. In their 
opinion, information about the radio intercept, which the 
Karabakh side bears witness to, as does the fact that at the 
site where the military plane came down near the village of 
Noragyukh in Askerasnkiy [Askeran] Rayon, there are fragments of 
five surface-to-air class missiles launched over the past 18 
months from anti-aircraft missile systems in the Azerbaijani 
towns of Mingechaur and TerTer. 
  However, Stepanakert is refraining from making any official 
statements until the commission has given its findings. One 
possible motive is said to be that the cause of the crash of the 
military helicopter carrying several Azerbaijani leaders in 
November 1991 in Nagorno-Karabakh has still not been 
established. The Azerbaijani side placed the blame on 
Stepanakert then without any proof, but the matter has still not 
been cleared up.

  [Text] The investigation by a group of Iranian experts into 
the cause of the crash in Khankendi [Stepanakert] of a C-130 
aircraft belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran is continuing 
at the crash site. Although the primary cause of the plane 
crash is not definitely clear yet and the state authorities are 
waiting for the investigation results from the dispatched group, 
agency reports and statements by local authorities indicate that 
it is likely that the plane crashed after being hit by a rocket. 
  According to a Central News Unit report, official Azeri 
authorities say that the Iranian C-130 was downed by Armenian 
anti-aircraft artillery positioned in the Khankendi area, which 
is a disputed area in Karabakh. Nevertheless, those reports 
have been rejected by Armenian authorities. 
  Our correspondent has been informed by an aviation expert 
that the Iranian captain had established contact with the 
Yerevan airport, but the contact was unsuccessful. The captain 
had also made contact with a Russian aircraft flying in the 
vicinity in order to coordinate with the airport with his 
assistance. The aviation experts believe it is unlikely that 
the C-130 plane crashed as a result of a technical fault.

    [Text] Yerevan March 21 TASS -- 34 bodies of people killed 
in 
the crash of the Iranian C-130 plane in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
including nine children, will be sent home on Monday in presence 
of Iranian diplomats, relatives and experts who arrived in 
Yerevan. 
  The Iranian experts intend to fly to Stepanakert to 
participate in the investigation of the aircrash on the spot. 
  It became known from reliable sources that the recording of 
the talk between traffic controllers of the Yerevan airport and 
the crew of the Iranian plane was sealed and would be studied by 
experts. 
  The C-130 plane had to fly through the Armenian airspace 
bound for Tehran, but deviated 100 kilometres from the route for 
unknown reasons. 
  It thus got into the airspace of Azerbaijan and crashed 
three 
kilometres off Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh.

  [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- Russian military experts do 
not rule out a possibility that the Iranian C-130 plane which 
crashed near Stepanakert on Friday was on a reconnaisance 
mission in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  "Why did Iranian pilots who knew that medium altitudes over 
a 
combat zone (of Nagorno-Karabakh) are mortally dangerous still 
flew towards Stepanakert and further headed towards the 
strategically important Lachin corridor (connecting the enclave 
with Armenia)", the experts told TASS on Monday. 
  They added that neither the special commission investigating 
the crash, nor the simultaneous statements of Armenians and 
Azeris denying their involvement in the crash will give an 
answer to the main question -- why the C-130 appeared in the 
airspace of Nagorno-Karabakh and why did the crew choose the 
course right over the combat area?. 
  The experts stressed that the crew of the plane had an 
unusually big number of members and that the craft did not need 
any emergency landing even if the cockpit was depressurised. 
  The plane could have landed in Gyandzha or Shamkhor in 
Azerbaijan where runways of former Soviet military airfields are 
big enough for all types of heavy planes. 
  The experts do not rule out that one of the warring sides 
shot down the plane mistaking it for an enemy one. It is quite 
possible the transport craft was attacked from a mobile 
anti-aircraft missile which are in big numbers in the combat 
zone, they added.

  [Text] The speaker of the Federation Council of the Russian 
Parliament Vladimir Shumeyko believes that the CIS 
inter-parliamentary assembly should help the process of forming 
the legal infrastructure of the treaty on creating a CIS 
Economic Union. 
  Addressing the Assembly session in St. Petersburg Friday, 
Shumeyko, also chairman of the Assembly's Council, said that 
pragmatic politicians and the peoples of the CIS had come to 
understand that only through joint actions and the consideration 
of mutual interests of the CIS partners would they be able to 
advance the reforms and build a democratic society. 
  He believes that obstacles should be removed on the way to 
the economic, currency and financial cooperation and favorable 
legal and economic conditions created for direct contacts 
between enterprises and commercial structures. 
  Shumeyko said that the CIS states should coordinate policies 
in the sphere of social and labor relations, the rights and 
guarantees for all working people and citizens, first and 
foremost in the sphere of employment, migration, social security. 
  Shumeyko believes it is necessary that the Assembly draft a 
document, a sort of a "social act" or "social charter of the CIS 
states" which would fix priorities of social policies and 
mechanism for their implementation. 
  Shumeyko drew everybody's attention to the need to solve, 
jointly with the executive branch of power and social and 
political forces, the problems associated with the position of 
ethnic groups and national minorities, as well as to continue 
peace-keeping efforts to settle the armed conflicts and reduce 
the acuteness of the related refugee problem. 
  He spoke in favor of helping the peace-keeping group on 
Karabakh created by the Assembly. 
  Taking part in the Assembly's session are parliamentary 
delegations of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan. Uzbekistan did not 
send its delegates. Also absent are representatives of Moldova 
and Ukraine, who attended the previous session as observers. 
Also attending are delegates of the Coordination Staff for 
Military Cooperation among CIS members and the General 
Confederation of Trade Unions.

  [Text] St.Petersburg, 18 Mar -- The resolution on 
recommended legislative acts regulating economic relations 
within the framework of the CIS Economic Union will serve to 
implement the Treaty on setting up the CIS Economic Union. This 
is stressed in a communique on the plenary setting of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly which ended today. 
  The participants in the sitting agreed with the proposal to 
draw up a model criminal code and a model code of criminal 
procedure and to speed up the preparation of legislative acts to 
fight crime in the CIS. Stressing the urgency of maintaining 
and recreating on new foundations a single educational and 
culture space within the framework of the CIS, the Assembly 
recommended that national parliaments adopt measures for the 
development of cooperation. A recommendation was approved to 
raise the social status of pupils in the system of education and 
science, and to join the UNESCO convention "Agreement on the 
importation of materials of an educational, scientific and 
cultural nature". It was found expedient to draw up a 
recommended act for keeping internal waters in CIS ecologically 
safe. Measures were defined to prepare for the celebration of 
victory in the 1941-1945 Great Patriotic War.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yakolev; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A meeting of defense force commanders of the Baltic 
countries has concluded with the signing of an agreement on the 
structure of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion. Its formation 
is planned to be finished by the end of next year. They took as 
an example a relevant sub-unit of the Scandinavian countries. 
It is likely that the main base of the battalion will be the 
Lithuanian military unit in Alytus. Lithuanian, Latvian, and 
Estonian lawyers will have to prepare and agree upon legislative 
acts that will ensure the normal function of the battalion. 
  The Baltic servicemen also agreed that it is necessary to 
have joint control over air space. Lithuania, Latvia, and 
Estonia consider participation in the Partnership for Peace 
program as a step toward integration with Western Europe and as 
a bridge that will help them to be closer to NATO. One cannot 
ignore, however, the fact that it is possible that Russia will 
join the program to blow up this bridge. This opinion was also 
expressed by the servicemen at a news conference. It is 
difficult as yet to calculate how much it will cost taxpayers to 
participate in the partnership. However, the Baltic politicians 
and servicemen underline that when one talks about security 
there is no room for bargaining.

  [Text] Moscow March 19 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's first meeting with the members of 
the Federation Council on March 17. 
  The meeting dealt with a specific subject discussed in 
detail 
by the MPs on the previous day -- defaults of payments -- and 
not the entire spectrum of socio-economic problems. 
  It is noteworthy that, despite the premier's rigid stand (he 
firmly declared against emergency measures in the economy, 
against mutual offsets of debts and the emission of money), the 
discussion was rather peaceful. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Friday's heavy snowfall and coup 
rumours: "It snowed heavily in Moscow on Friday and, as is 
usually the case, the mayor's office as represented by the 
road-cleaning service was not prepared for such a whim of 
winter. "There developed huge traffic jams in the streets, and 
the cars of many statesmen got stuck. According to reliable 
information, some of them, to while away the time, discussed 
rumours about a coup that was allegedly to be carried out on 
Thursday. "Analysing numerous pronouncements by opposition 
members at a rally and in the state duma, one can only guess who 
it was who intended to overthrow the lawfully elected president 
or, vice-versa, to enhance his authority. "Even if a coup 
began, it would have hardly succeeded because tanks (as the main 
attribute of Moscow unrest) would not have been able to 
manoeuvre in the snow-drifted and traffic-blocked streets of the 
capital". 
  KOSMOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Moscow Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov who, touching upon possible actions of the 
opposition on May 1, stated: "We prepare for a possible unrest 
most seriously. Militia have been provided with all the 
necessary technical equipment. Law enforcement agencies have 
been instructed to put a stop to actions that would threaten the 
safety or disturb the peace of Muscovites". NOVAYA GAZETA on a 
timetable for full withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia: 
"The diplomats of Russia and Latvia have agreed upon a 
timetable for full withdrawal of Russian troops from the 
territory of Latvia. Russia will lease the Skrunda radar for 
four years and then it will dismantle it in 18 months' time. 
The question of radar lease payments remains undecided. An 
amount of two million U.S. dollars does not suit the Latvian 
side. "Russian politicians do not want to draw lessons from 
their lamentable experience. We assumed obligations for a 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Eastern European countries and 
we ourselves determined time-limits and then tried to settle the 
financial problems. "Having left behind residential buildings, 
a developed infrastructure, office space, etc. In the countries 
where its troops stayed, Russia in exchange received bills for 
ruined ecology, moral damage, etc". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) on the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from Belarus. Two missile divisions stationed at Mozyr 
and Lida are to be withdrawn and are to be fully disbanded by 
mid-1996. All military and residential townships of missilemen 
are to be turned over to the Belarusian side. Speaking about 
the future of missilemen themselves, Lieutenant-General Viktor 
Yesin, chief of the operations division of the main headquarters 
of strategic missile forces, pointed out that they will serve in 
undermanned Russian units. Commissioned and non-commissioned 
officers who remain in Belarus will enjoy all the rights of 
Belarusian citizens. 
  SOVIETSKAYA ROSSIA runs an address to the citizens of Russia 
by the leaders of the left-centre opposition. The address 
reads, in particular, as follows: "We are backed by the creative 
experience and heroism of the great citizens of Russian and the 
patriots of the motherland. 
  "We are backed by the millennia-long experience of Russian 
statehood. We shall strive for national concord and 
consolidation of society and for the enlistment of the efforts 
of all citizens-patriots for the restoration of the wrecked 
Russia which is at a loss." 
  ST. PETERSBURG GAZETTE recalls that cityfolk are to go the 
polls on Sunday to elect members of the ST. PETERSBURG municipal 
assembly. Fifty seats are being contested by more than 740 
candidates. 
  The municipal court issued a ruling recognising as invalid 
the point in the statute of elections which previously limited 
the participation of servicemen and students without a 
residential registration in the polling. This time they are 
also included in the voters' lists.

  -- Provision of state support for privatized enterprises. 
  2. When forming the authorized capital of joint-stock 
companies with shares open to the public in which the state 
preserves its share, primarily the following blocks of shares 
should be envisaged:

  -- The labor collective; 
  -- The foreign partner; 
  For sale in the open market at stock exchanges or securities 
markets, inter alia abroad.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 20 Mar -- During the night there was a big 
clash between Russian border troops and Tajik opposition 
fighters in one of the sectors of the Pyanj border detachment.

Tajikistan with weapons and ammunition. Their attempt did not 
succeed, and abandoning their loads and leaving several dead, 
the fighters returned to the other side of the border. There 
are no casualties among the Russian border troops. 
  According to the Russian military, the past 24 hours have

  [Text] Today, the final round of negotiations between the 
Belarusian Government and the IMF mission was held with the 
participation of Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich. 
The discussion focused on the issues of carrying out economic 
reforms in Belarus and the role of the IMF in their 
implementation. The strategic goals of supporting the 
continuous, effective improvement of the Belarusian economy, and 
increasing people's living standards were specified in the 
signed memorandum of mutual understanding between the government 
and the IMF. The strategy of the program is mainly based on the 
renewal of macroeconomic stability, economy, the strengthening 
of market tendencies including a decrease in inflation, the 
recovery of balance of payments, and protection of the weakest 
groups of the population during the transition period. At the 
meeting, an agreement was reached to open a permanent IMF 
mission and nominate its chairman. The opening of this mission 
is planned for July 1994.

<F P=106> [Igor Chernov report from the "Latest News: TRUD </F>
Correspondents and News Agencies Report" roundup: "The 
President Has Been Unlucky... With the Weather"] 
  [Text] Sochi -- Russian President B. Yeltsin has spent 
almost a week in Sochi -- half the spring vacation. Journalists 
are not allowed past the gates of the vacation home, and, as 
such, information about what is going on at "Facility No. 1" (as 
the president's dacha is called) has to be obtained secondhand. 
  N. Yegorov, chief of the Kuban Administration, and Sochi 
Mayor N. Karpov, who have visited Boris Nikolayevich, report 
that the president is in excellent form and was very keen to 
discuss the problems facing Krasnodar Kray and the resort of 
Sochi. 
  According to reports from other sources close to the 
president's entourage, Boris Nikolayevich is relaxing and 
putting in a lot of work on the mechanism for implementing the 
Memorandum of Accord. The only thing giving the head of Russia 
cause to complain is the mediocre weather: It is cool (plus 8 
degrees) and overcast in Sochi, and it has been spitting rain 
all week. 
  Being on the territory of the president's dacha is a 
somewhat 
luckier break: It is one of three state dachas located in the 
central part of the resort on the Bocharovo Brook. I admit that 
I have not actually viewed its attractions, but I do know 
something of the specialized facility. The dacha is a two-story 
building built in the 1950's for the Union leadership. 
Khrushchev, Tikhonov, and Ryzhkov all took vacations here.... 
According to the recollections of older people in the locality, 
Boris Nikolayevich first came to the "Bocharka" in the fall of 
1985. 
  Rumor has it that, on that fall evening in 1985, "Facility 
No. 1" made a good impression on Boris Nikolayevich, and when 
Yeltsin became president the main dacha on the Bocharovo Brook 
was assigned to him alone. Since 1991 the Yeltsins have spent 
two separate weeks a year here. 
  Boris Nikolayevich's aides and accompanying personnel live 
on 
the first floor of the building. The presidential suite is on 
the second floor. 
  The dacha stands on an elevated section of ground. From the 
windows there is a marvelous view over the sea, and all around 
is a fabulous, subtropical park in which rare plants abound. 
  Boris Nikolayevich as we know, prefers active recreation: 
limbering up on the tennis court, swimming in a pool with heated 
sea water, playing billiards... Of course, the dacha does have 
its own beach, but at this time of the year it is only "hardy 
winter bathers" who take to the sea....

  [Text] Sochi March 19 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin, 
Krasnodar Territorial Administration Chief Nikolay Yegorov and 
Sochi Administration Chief Nikolay Karpov flew over the south 
western areas of Kuban territory on Friday in a helicopter. They 
also surveyed the border area of Russia, the water areas of 
Novorossiisk and Tuapse ports, rice plantations, vineyards, and 
health resort complexes of Anapa and Sochi, a spokesman in the 
press service of the Sochi City Administration told ITAR-TASS on 
Saturday. 
  Most pressing problems of territorial development were 
discussed after the long flight. The president devoted special 
attention to matters connected with the accommodation of Russian 
Army units in those regions. 
  Migration problems, the development of inter-ethnic 
relations 
in the territory and various aspects of action to fight crime 
were discussed as well. The president instructed that the 
entire package of these matters be prepared to be discussed by 
Russia's Security Council session. 
  During the survey of the Tuapse and Novorossiisk ports, a 
programme for the development of the entire transportation 
complex of southern regions of Russia was discussed. 
  The president issued a number of instructions concerning the 
preservation of land reclamation systems in Kuban. A decision 
was taken to draft a special decree concerning the development 
of the children's health resort of Anapa.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian </F>
President's Administration, by correspondent Sergey Medvedev; 
place and date not given; from the "Novosti" newscast -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Medvedev] Sergey Aleksandrovich, the president is 
having a rest. Does that mean that the president's office is 
resting as well? I know that many of the president's aides are 
also resting or undergoing treatment -- Kostikov, Ryurikov, 
Ilyushin -- none of them are in the Kremlin. Who is in charge 
of the state in the president's absence? 
  [Filatov] Well, firstly, the president himself is in charge, 
because as you know he went, as he said, both to rest and to 
work. He is indeed working every day. Every day we receive 
signed decrees and orders from him, various instructions. Every 
day we speak to him on the telephone and consult him on various 
issues. So firstly, he has the entire situation in the country 
in hand. But the prime minister and the government are working, 
and naturally the president's office and administration are 
working as well. So we are all working. 
  [Medvedev] At the moment a second wave of rumors seems to be 
spreading. In the corridors of the State Duma, for example, 
these rumors were whipped up fairly actively on Friday. They 
concern Boris Nikolayevich's health. Do you speak to him often 
by telephone? Because people are even saying that the president 
nearly came back to Moscow in secret. 
  [Filatov] One of the unpleasant features or actions of the 
opposition that I have clearly perceived over the last two years 
at least, has been to inflate the question of the president's 
health, and especially to raise this question at the moment when 
the president is on vacation. And sometimes, I have a suspicion 
that these people want above all else to wreck his vacation -- 
to summon him back early from vacation, for example, or just to 
spoil his mood on vacation. 
  I would like to make use of your camera to say: Give the 
president a chance to rest. He is a human being too, and he has 
a right to rest for 10 days or so twice a year, and to rest in 
peace and quiet, so that he is not tormented by these entirely 
superfluous and unnecessary suspicions being blown up. I can 
understand why -- in order to create an atmosphere of 
nervousness in society. In this instance, I think that if 
society is driven into such a nervous state with the help of 
such rumors, it could result in some sort of disruption. Well, 
we have had enough disruptions. 
  Naturally, everyone feels a certain anxiety about the way 
our 
reforms will go in the future. But nevertheless, let us hope we 
can go on without any of those upheavals, which unfortunately, 
certain forces are trying to lead us into. You see, they are 
deliberately trying to remind us of those events, suggesting 
that they have thought up a new way to do everything in Russia. 
  But I think that if we do indeed proceed from civic accord, 
if we proceed from the fact that we want to achieve something as 
a society, I think we should get through the year all right.

  [Text] The deputy chief of the regional desk of President 
Yeltsin's Office Sergey Samoylov has told an IF reporter the 
president's men approved the removal of Vladivostok's Mayor 
Viktor Cherepkov from office. 
  Cherepkov was unseated Wednesday evening. Addressing the 
present situation in Vladivostok, Samoylov said he had kept an 
eye on Cherepkov's performance ever since he rose to power. 
  Soon after he was elected Mayor, Cherepkov arrived in Moscow 
with a bulky package of documents detrimental to the image of 
Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko of the Primorskiy Region. A 
subsequent inquiry showed, however, that the negative data 
related mostly to performance by Nazdratenko's predecessor 
Kuznetsov. 
  Cherepkov's opponents responded in kind and presented Moscow 
with a package of negative data on his performance. They 
claimed, among other things, that, pretending to be a sea 
captain, Cherepkov had visited Japan to buy a dozen cars. 
  According to Samoylov, Cherepkov spent at least four of his 
several months in office in Moscow. His dispute with the 
region's leaders diverted his attention from the city's 
problems. More than once he moved to restructure the city 
government, took control of the districts' budgets and earmarked 
substantial sums in aid to the local media editions which acted 
as his mouthpiece. His efforts to update the city government 
proved a failure. 
  The State Legal Administration suggested that Governor 
Yevgeniy Nazdratenko unseat Cherepkov. First, however, 
Nazdratenko was to have appeared on television to explain what 
motivated his move against the Vladivostok Mayor. The 
Primorskiy Administration preferred to stall until Viktor 
Cherepkov was accused of bribe-taking and a number of his 
associates were arrested, several weeks ago. On representation 
from the court authorities, Cherepkov was finally removed from 
office.

  [Text] Orenburg - The necessary 25 per cent turnout was 
reported in the elections of candidates to representative 
bodies of power in 28 of 47 constituencies of the orenburg 
region. Chairman of the Regional Electoral Commission, Yuriy 
Andreyev, told ITAR-TASS that the necessary turnout will be 
reached in at least four other constituencies before polling 
stations close today. According to the law, two-thirds of 47 
candidates have to be elected to enable the regional legislative 
assembly to come into force. 
  Final results of the polls will be announced by 5 a.m March 
21. 
  Vologda - Only 6 out of 15 regional electoral commissions 
reported the necessary 25 per cent turnout in elections by 14:00 
p.m.today. Over 20 per cent of electors had cast their votes in 
the Vologda region by this time. The Regional Electoral 
Commission hopes that the necessary 25 per cent barrier will be 
reached by the time polling stations close today. 
  Perm - Reports from the Perm region say that a number of 
deputies' seats in the Perm regional assembly and local 
government will remain vacant. Only 22 out of 40 constituencies 
reported the necessary 25 per cent turnout in the polls. 
Chairman of the Regional Electoral Commission, Anatoliy 
Lebedev, told ITAR-TASS that by-elections which under the law 
can be held in twelve weeks, will require additional 
expenditures of no less than one billion roubles. 
  St.Petersburg - The turnout in elections to representative 
bodies of power in the Leningrad region is rather poor. Only 
10 per cent of registered electors had voted by noon today. 
Under the law, elections are recognised valid if no less than

  [Text] The Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine will be 
receiving more than 120 billion rubles in state support. This 
was the result of a Moscow meeting between Russian First Vice 
Premier Oleg Soskovets and representatives of the combine's 
workers' collectives. 
  It was noted at the meeting that state support for the 
Magnitogorsk Combine is needed because modernization of the 
production facilities there has been halted owing to a shortage 
of funds.

  [Text] Important international events were discussed at a 
news conference in the Seimas today. Guoda Salciute reports: 
  [Salciute] The Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas commented 
at 
a news conference on today's events. They are the initialing of 
the Lithuanian-Polish Treaty in Warsaw and a meeting of the 
military representatives of the Baltic States in preparing a 
joint peace-keeping battalion. 
  [Begin Jursenas recording] How the coincidence of these two 
events can be explained, or how should one explain this? I 
think that the main thing here is our advance toward Europe. 
Both events are linked with our joining European, Western and 
world structures. I dare to state on this occasion that we 
ensure the continuity of Lithuanian foreign policy, of an 
independent state, starting with 11 March 1990 up to this day. 
We are convinced that one of the most important things that 
must be ensured for our state are its security and its 
stability. Both internal means and the corresponding means of 
international policy are needed for this purpose. 
  Thus the regulation of relations with our neighbors, the 
existence of good, normal and friendly relations with our 
neighbors are exceptionally important in the sense of our 
internal situation, too. If we speak of real advance in Europe, 
but not of a declaration or nice words, then my dear ones, 
nobody is waiting for us in Europe, nobody is waiting for us who 
quarrel with neighbors, who are not reconciled with neighbors, 
who have not eliminated some conflicts. Europe is not waiting 
for such, it has enough of its own problems and suffers because 
of the former Yugoslavia or some other situations. Thus we can 
more successfully join European structures and can take part in 
the creation of a new Europe only if we regulate as far as we 
can our relations with our neighbors. 
  Our previous governments have accomplished a great deal in 
this direction, I greatly appreciate this, and what they did not 
manage to accomplish or what they have started, like, for 
example, a Lithuanian-Polish declaration signed by esteemed 
Saudargas [former Lithuanian foreign minister] and esteemed 
Skubiszewski, what the previous government did not manage to 
accomplish, we are doing this. [end recording] 
  [Salciute] Having assessed the Lithuanian-Polish Treaty, 
Jursenas also dealt with the hue and cry by some politicians in 
Lithuania about this document, with meetings and pickets, with a 
statement by six parties. Having stressed juridical 
involuntariness [as heard] of this statement, Jursenas asked 
which experts write such statements. 
  The Seimas chairman also spoke at the news conference about 
the first days of the Seimas spring session. Although only 
three days have passed, two capital laws have been adopted: On 
land and on the reliability of the litas. Asked by journalists 
whether he himself had confidence in the litas, Jursenas replied 
that he had and will have confidence in the litas, which has 
undergone many tests.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 18 (SNARK)--The Armenia's Office of 
Prosecutor has decided to arrest Vahan Avakyan, the first deputy 
of the Chief Adviser of the Armenian president on questions of 
national security. David Shahnazaryan, the acting chief of the 
Armenia's State Department of National Security, said that on 
March 15 in the Yerevan airport "Zvartnots" Zaruyi Yavuryan, the 
wife of Avakyan had been arrested when she tried to take out 
from the republic 6 floppy diskettes and documents with the 
secret information, which was, according to the official 
resolution, state secret. 
  Vahan Avakyan, who was in Moscow in that time, refused to 
return to Armenia, when the president apparat called him back. 
Some time later he connected with the president apparat by 
telephone and said that he was out of the CIS and was under 
protection of a foreign country. 
  According to Shahnazaryan, they instituted proceeding on 
these facts. Ashot Manucharyan, the former Chief Adviser of the 
Armenian president on National security, acts as a witness in 
this case but he refused to give any testimony. On 
Shahnazaryan's words, taking into account the publications in 
the Bulgarian press, Vahan Avakyan is in Bulgaria now. 
"Armenian officially asked Bulgaria's authorities about that 
but hasn't received any explanation yet." Shahnazaryan said.

<F P=106> [Statement from Russian Federation Defense Ministry </F>
Information and Press Directorate under "From Informed Sources" 
rubric: "Let Us Not Dramatize"] 
  [Text] On 16 March 1994, PRAVDA published an article by 
Major General Viktor Chudov, retired, entitled "Our Strategists 
Are Too Unsophisticated." In the article he discussed the 
forthcoming Russo-U.S. joint exercises. The article contained a 
series of gross distortions. The author of the article, who 
does not have true information on the planned exercises, casts 
doubt on the military-political expediency of them and, at the 
same time, of the whole range of Russo-U.S. relations in the 
military sphere. 
  The publication distorts the scale and nature of the planned 
exercises. In particular, the author asserts that the U.S. 3d 
Infantry Division and the Russian Armed Forces 27th Motorized 
Rifle Division are being drafted into this event in their full 
complement. In fact the plan is not to stage troop exercises 
involving all the personnel of the two divisions together with 
their combat hardware and weapons but merely a command and staff 
exercise with a very limited number of personnel (up to 250 men 
per side) and vehicles. 
  Parts of the forthcoming exercise will indeed be rehearsed 
at 
the Totskiy test range. This is due to the fact that the 27th 
Motorized Rifle Division is stationed in the area of the test 
range and a center for training peacekeeping forces, the only 
one of its kind in the Russian Armed forces at present, has been 
created here. 
  As for the cost of holding the exercise, the United States 
is 
prepared to bear that in full (up to $2 million). For the 
Russian side this is a planned exercise and does not entail any 
additional costs. 
  The main aim of this joint measure is to rehearse questions 
of cooperation in the performance of peacekeeping operations. 
The forthcoming command and staff exercise should make a real 
contribution to the cause of international cooperation in the 
settlement of conflicts in trouble spots and to the preservation 
of world peace.

  [Text] Yerevan March 18 TASS -- Although Armenia has 
nothing to do with Thursday's crash of the Iranian aircraft 
outside its skies, it renders comprehensive assistance to the 
Iranian authorities in the crash investigation, First Deputy 
Armenian Foreign Minister Zhirair Liparityan told a briefing for 
correspondents and representatives of foreign embassies tonight. 
  In his words, "the Iranian C-130 plane on its way from 
Moscow 
to Tehran passed Georgia at 22:08 on March 17 but did not enter 
the Armenian skies as it was planned. The aircraft deviated 
from the air corridor by approximately 100 kilometers, entered 
the Azeri skies and headed for Nagorno-Karabakh." 
  According to information of the Armenian Foreign Ministry, 
"the plane crashed approximately 14 kilometers away from 
Stepanakert, meanwhile the Karabakh Information and Press 
Department reports the accident place five kilometers away from 
the Karabakh capital". All the passengers and 14 crew members 
died. 
  "The plane carried 31 people," said Liparityan. He made no 
further comments, saying he "does not have more information". 
  A statement of the Armenian Government's Civil Aviation 
Department was circulated tonight to say "the Iranian plane on 
its way from Moscow to Tehran deviated from its route by 100 
kilometers on unknown reasons at 22:30 on March 17 and found 
itself in the Karabakh skies. The plane crashed five kilometers 
away from Stepanakert. Circumstances of the crash are being 
specified".

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, March 22 (TASS) -- Russian newspapers 
highlight the meeting between Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, and elections to the 
local power bodies. 
  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI quotes Chernomyrdin as saying about the 
results of the talks with Mr Hata that "Russia, when tackling a 
solution to the territorial dispute with Japan, will act without 
haste. The issue cannot be resolved at a sweep". The newspaper 
points out that the Russian premier expressed hope that the 
issue would be resolved. "We shall approach the conclusion of a 
peace treaty between our two countries in any case. A solution 
to the territorial problem is one of prerequisites for such a 
treaty". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA remarks in this connection that "it is, 
probably, the Russian side that to a greater extent remains 
pleased with the results of the talks held in Moscow by Japanese 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Although the meeting with 
Russian premier gave certain satisfaction to the Japanese 
minister: This time the Russian premier did not make tough 
remarks, as he did at the end of last year, about it being 
impossible to hand over the Kuril Islands under any 
circumstances". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on elections to local power bodies: 
  "Last Sunday's elections to the local representative power 
bodies in the regions of the Russian Federation revealed, on the 
whole, the electorate's indifference and passivity. 
Irrespective of the final election results, this conclusion 
could be drawn immediately after the polls closed." 
  TRUD on local election results: 
  "Such outcome of the elections in a number of Russian 
regions 
can hardly satisfy the federal authorities either. For a low 
turnout of voters is indicative of the Russians' low trust in 
power in general. And this is understandable. Over the past 
several years, there were so many well wishers who promised 
people a lot. Meanwhile, the life of the majority of ordinary 
citizens has not changed for the better". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on local election results: 
  "People, having got disillusioned with the abilities of `the 
people's elected representatives' to change if only anything in 
their life, were not in a hurry to go to the polls. 
  "Experts explain the passiveness of the population by a 
number of other reasons as well. Not of least importance in 
this respect is the excessively protracted nature of the 
election campaign, and Moscow's insufficient interest in the 
electoral process at the local level". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Colonel-General 
Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy minister of defence, under 
the headline " The Second Phase of the Reform: What Awaits the 
Army". 
  The newspaper points out that the first phase of the 
reforming of the Russian Army and Navy is over. Main organising 
measures to create the armed forces of Russia proper have been 
carried out. 
  In response to a question what awaits the armed forces in 
the 
future, the deputy defence minister said: "The armed forces will 
become, firstly, a relatively small but powerful and modile army 
provided with the most effective systems of weapons and military 
hardware and capable of defending Russia from encroachments from 
the outside and be the guarantor of peace and stability in the 
country. 
  "Secondly, this will be an army of a democratic state, which 
has fundamentally different relationships with society and the 
state and enjoying respect and prestige among the people. 
  "Thirdly, this will be an important instrument of national 
policy, maintaining all the best from the traditions of its 
predecessors, everything that was connected with the 
accomplishment of exclusively defensive tasks. 
  "These three positions in point of fact reflect the 
principal 
meaning of the current process of the Russian Armed Forces 
reform", General Kondratyev said.

  [Text] Armenia favors a peaceful solution to the regional 
conflict through peace talks involving Azerbaijan, 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Russia as well as European 
countries and the U.S., Deputy Speaker of Parliament Ara Saakyan 
told Interfax. However, he said that unconditional cease-fire 
should precede any such talks. 
  Saakyan said that unlike Azerbaijan which insists on the 
withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azeri lands as a 
condition for cease-fire, Nagorno-Karabakh demands an end to the 
fighting and definition of its status first. 
  In his words, Yerevan is laying great hopes on Russia's 
peace 
effort in the region. 
  In the meantime, the continued differences between Yerevan 
and Baku had prevented the CIS interparliamentary assembly 
meeting in St. Petersburg over the weekend from adopting an 
appeal on CIS states not to resort to transport or energy 
blockade against each other. 
  Leader of the Azeri parliamentary delegation Afiyaddin 
Jalilov spoke of 20 percent of Azeri territory being annexed by 
Karabakh Armenians calling to include into the final paper a 
provision for Armenian pullout and the return of more than a 
million Azeri refugees to their homes.

  [Text] Yerevan March 21 TASS -- Russian Vice-Premier Oleg 
Soskovets and Armenian Premier Grant Bagratyan have signed an 
accord on restarting the Armenian nuclear power plant. 
  Under the accord, the parties will conduct a joint 
examination of the main units of the plant and put them into 
operation, after taking additional measures to ensure its safe 
functioning. They will also train operational and technical 
maintenance personnel for the plant. 
  Russia will deliver nuclear fuel to the station, help the 
plant operators and assist in setting up Armenian bodies of 
control over nuclear materials and the nuclear power engineering 
network. 
  For its part, Armenia will introduce the rules and standards 
now in use at the Russian nuclear power plants and take steps to 
secure physical safety of the plant. 
  Under the agreement, Armenia pledges not to use the nuclear 
and non-nuclear materials received from Russia, as well as the 
nuclear and non-nuclear materials, installations and equipment 
created on their basis for producing nuclear weapons and other 
nuclear explosives or for attaining any military objectives. 
  Specialists and their families will be granted the right of 
free travel to Armenia. Tax and duty exemption will be granted 
for required goods brought into Armenia for the purpose of 
restarting the moth-balled nuclear power plant. 
  Armenian Prime-Minister Grant Bagratyan believes that the 
accord signed between the two countries marks a great step 
towards meeting Armenia's energy needs, which have been 
accumulating since the power station was moth-balled in the wake 
of the 1988 disastrous earthquake.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 18 (SNARK) -- 15.7 per cent of 
Yerevan residents would vote once again in favor of the 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan if the election were held in the 
nearest future. These are the results of the poll carried out 
in the first week of March by the "National Self-determination" 
Union (NSU)'s Public Opinion Studies Center. In 1991, when the 
President election was held, over 80 per cent of Armenian 
citizens voted for Levon Ter-Petrosyan. 
  More than a quarter of the respondents, the total number of 
which is 600, claimed they wouldn't vote for any candidate. 
13.2 per cent prefer the NSU leader Paruyr Hayrikyan. Other 
candidates' rating is far lower. 
  According to the poll, published in Yerevan newspaper 
"Ankakhutyun" (Independence), about 9 per cent of Yerevan 
residents will vote for the ruling party - Armenian National 
(Pannational] Movement. Most chances have Armenian 
Revolutionary Federation "Dashnaktsutyun" (20.8 per cent), and 
NSU (11.5 per cent). A little more than 8 per cent of the 
respondents choose to vote for the Communist Party.

<F P=106> [Weekly interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the </F>
Supreme Council and head of state, by correspondent Nato Onaini; 
in Tbilisi -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, a week after the visit 
to the United States by a Georgian delegation, James Baker has 
arrived in Tbilisi. Could this be regarded as a continuation of 
your U.S. visit from the political point of view, or is it a 
coincidence? Can we speak of Georgia's new role? And how 
founded is the irritation of the Russian press and of certain 
circles with the visits to the United States by Nazarbayev, 
Kravchuk, and yourself? The view has been expressed that the 
United States is gaining spheres of influence from Russia. 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. As I have already 
said, Jim Baker's visit is connected with his being a cochairman 
of a committee for the salvation of Georgia. On my arrival in 
Washington we had a very short meeting and we agreed that he 
will come to Tbilisi and we will continue our exchange of views 
on the fate of democracy in Georgia, on the economy of Georgia, 
and on the main ideas for business relations between Georgian 
and U.S. business. His advice is essential for us. He has 
great experience. [passage omitted] 
  It was considered essential that the American community, 
that 
U.S. citizens listen to my views on various issues. The main 
direction of my speeches in the United States -- you attended 
meetings and listened to them -- was that it is inadmissible to 
permit a recurrence of the cold war. This issue was covered 
from different points of view but my principal approach was that 
this would be a disaster for the world and every country would 
pay a high price for that. There is no reason for anyone to be 
irritated or jealous. All ultrareactionaries, from our region 
or from others, dream of an ice-age. 
  I think that my contention that Russia and the United States 
should continue in partnership to handle all complex issues of 
the modern world found a fertile soil in the United States and I 
hope that the wishes and aspirations of the majority of Russian 
people are directed toward this principle of partnership. 
  As for the visits to the United States or to any other 
country by heads of the CIS countries, I think these are 
ordinary events which should not surprise anyone. An 
independent country is independent because its leader can 
himself decide where to go and where not to. 
  Now, your question about whether Georgia's role will 
increase: I would say that interest toward Georgia is 
substantial. It is natural that if we manage to achieve 
stability, if we manage to settle the Abkhazian issue by normal 
political means, to settle the issue of Samachablo, and to 
revive our economy, we will have our own identity and gain our 
place in world politics. It is natural that this will result in 
a new function of the state. This will be a function of 
determining not only internal policy but also policy in foreign 
relations. 
  You have said that individual public figures in Russia make 
claims against the United States for widening their spheres of 
influence. I do not think that this is the case today. 
Nowadays, we should have a different comprehension of spheres 
of influence. Today, people will find themselves in these 
spheres of influence not depending on who is strong but 
depending on what principles of Weltanschauung they have and 
what model of economic development or rather what experience of 
economic development they are offered. 
  We have to say that we have already determined our relations 
with Russia and it is impossible to speak more than has already 
been said. We have said that we want friendship with Russia, we 
want close relationships. At the same time, we need relations 
with the whole surrounding world. 
  I think that these first reactions to trips by presidents 
[of 
the CIS countries] will pass. Everything will be understood in 
the right way and life will go ahead in a normal way. 
  [Oniani] Just recently we spoke about the economy. The 
hardships of the postcommunist years in Georgia seem to be due 
to a naive attitude toward the economy. This has already been 
said repeatedly. Speaking of the economy, the people used to 
say -- and quite loudly -- that for the sake of independence 
they are ready to eat grass. Eventually it appeared that it is 
not that simple. Yesterday, at the first congress of the Union 
of Georgia's Citizens, most of your speech was dedicated to 
economic problems. You said that economic stabilization will 
begin in the country in 1995. It is clear that foreign 
investments will require a legislative basis. This is an issue 
which has been repeatedly put forward in France and in the 
United States by foreign partners. Speaking of the Cabinet of 
Ministers, you said that ministries should be structures of 
political significance rather than economic. How far do you 
think the present cabinet will manage to implement the reforms 
you and outher speakers mentioned? Moreover, the parliament is 
going to discuss the issue of the cabinet at its sitting 
tomorrow. 
  [Shevardnadze] Yesterday's congress was a very serious 
occasion. I have no doubt now that it will be a mass movement. 
I cannot help saying that the delegates' businesslike and 
professional speeches made me happy. The speeches were very 
comprehensive. I would highlight the youth. They crowned the 
congress. [passage omitted praising speakers, audience, 
documents passed at the congress] 
  As for what will happen in the parliament, of course, it is 
difficult to forecast. I would say one thing. I request this 
from both the majority and the minority. I have planned 
meetings with them. I ask them to approach the issue in a very 
serious way. I want the radio listeners to hear it and know it. 
Change for the sake of change will never be effective. A 
change should not be an end in itself. I said yesterday that no 
magician will come to the Georgian Government. And the 
introduction of 1, or 2, or 10 inexperienced people into the 
government means that they will not be able to do anything 
during the next three or four months. They will find it very 
hard. Seeking a scapegoat will cost the state even more. 
  If it were for me, I would not replace the principal staff. 
There is talk about corruption and that some ministers cannot be 
trusted. This is another thing. This needs yet additional 
arguments. A general conversation is not sufficient. [passage 
omitted on the current situation in Georgia and prospects of 
reviving the economy] 
  In this situation, any replacement of ministers could have 
grave consequences. This should be considered by 
parliamentarians. Above all, a majority of the ministers, 
especially those in charge of the economy, have had experience 
in international economic relations and have acquired a minimum 
of the knowledge needed to handle foreign investments and import 
foreign products. This is a school. A new person will find it 
difficult to start from the very beginning. That is why I say 
that the parliament should take all this into consideration. If 
the parliament makes a decision which cannot lead to an 
improvement in the situation, this will further undermine the 
authority of the parliament, of its chairman, and of the head of 
state, too. 
  It is necessary for parliament to attach much more attention 
to the creation of legislative bases, especially regarding 
foreign investments. We have found plenty of partners. 
Incidentally, Mr. Baker named one big industrialist, who works 
in the sphere of oil- prospecting, and said that he has serious 
claims against our legislature. He is ready to come to Georgia 
along with other companies. He believes that there is much oil 
in Georgia. He knows there are people who will work. But the 
existing laws are not sufficient for such wide-range 
cooperation. Therefore, apart from changes in the cabinet and 
sacking or changing ministers, the parliament should do its best 
to create a legislative basis. 
  My remarks that there should be certain improvements in 1994 
and that 1995 should become a year of stabilization and that 
improvements will be felt by all families in 1995, are not 
simply cheap talks, provided the approach in parliament, in 
government, and in all rayons and regions is serious . 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] In your speech you spoke about the role 
of the constitution which is in the process of being drafted. 
You claimed that it is necessary to introduce the post of 
president to serve as an essential element in overcoming the 
crisis. After all the negative assessments of the presidential 
post which were made by the former opposition and in view of 
general attitudes, how much chance do you think this idea has of 
being accepted? And how necessary is it for Georgia to have a 
president? 
  [Shevardnadze] [Passage omitted: Shevardnadze says he spoke 
about this at the congress but he knows his speech at the 
congress was too long to be published] By all means, a country 
like Georgia needs a strong power, a strong executive power and 
correct relations between the executive power and the parliament 
as well as a judicial power. A country which is in crisis and 
which has a peculiar (?geopolicy) will not be able to stabilize 
itself itself with a relatively weak power. I said yesterday 
that the president's power and authority should be a guarantee 
of the country's security, integrity, and unity. 
  As for our bitter experience, I would like to say that 
history knows good and bad presidents in various countries. 
Some have been good, some bad, and some even criminal. This 
happened in the United States but the United States did not 
reject the idea of the presidency. 
  We need a good and strong president. I have been convinced 
of this by numerous discussions. The people have had 
experience. They know what sort of person not to elect. And 
this means a lot. I think there is a rather wide and 
interesting spectrum of political figures at present. There is 
a big choice. However, this is my own idea and it may not be 
accepted by the constitutional commission. Neither may it be 
accepted by the parliament and the people. [Passage omitted 
elaborating] 
  It can be said that certain mistakes are made not only 
during 
presidential elections -- this should also be considered -- but 
during parliamentary elections, too. Not many parliaments are 
ideal, so to say. I do not mean our parliament. 
  [Oniani] And yet another phrase from your speech: Abkhazia 
will have the autonomy stipulated by European or world 
standards. You said this and added that the CIS, and especially 
Russia's experiences and serious achievements in the 
construction of the state should be taken into consideration. 
How should we understand this? What does it mean? Today, yet 
another round of talks about Abkhazia will take place. How 
efficient do you think it will be considering that in Abkhazia 
progressively thinking Abkhazians -- I mean the Movement for 
Peaceful Abkhazia -- managed to issue a statement on the current 
situation in Abkhazia. This means that such people exist. The 
people have always existed but the main thing is that they have 
managed to say this aloud. This means that the situation is 
changing. 
  [Shevardnadze] Speaking of Abkhazia yesterday, I meant that 
it could be autonomous or something else. I meant Abkhazia's 
political status, in principle. I also spoke about the 
political status of Ajara. The rights Abkhazia had before the 
war, before the conflict, met all world standards. I spoke 
about this at the UN Security Council and this was unexpected 
for many. 
  We are ready to have a wider look at this issue, to 
distinguish functions as is needed for each to do his own job. 
As for the Russian experience, I am talking about a 
constitutional solution to the problem. I consider it to have 
been Yeltsin's big victory when he managed to induce the people 
to adopt the constitution in the shape he suggested. I am 
referring to the rights, duties, and representation of the 
subjects [of the federation] in the supreme bodies, in the 
parliament in particular. I think this experience should be 
discussed in the press as well as on television and so on so 
that the people can have a better idea about it. It is a very 
interesting experience. 
  I have been told that the presentation of the UN secretary 
general's report to the Security Council has been scheduled for 
today. Decisions will not apparently be made today or tomorrow, 
as far as I understand. But I believe that the report will be 
an ideal reflection of the situation in Abkhazia. 
  Now, with regard to the recent broadcasts of the Movement 
for 
Peaceful Abkhazia, I have to admit that I am not well aware of 
this. I listened to it in the same way as you did. Certain 
radio stations have registered this. It has been said that this 
originated in Abkhazia, in Sukhumi, that is, in the heart of 
Abkhazia. As far as I know, ethnic Abkhazians residing in 
Abkhazia as well as from the outside take an active part in this 
movement. I do not think that it comes from the Tbilisi, from 
Tbilisi Abkhazians. It is important because the appeal to live 
in peace, to return to Abkhazia, and to restore the age-old 
traditions we have had for centuries is coming from Abkhazia. 
[passage omitted: exhibitions are planned to demonstrate 
Georgia's intellectual and industrial potential. Shevardnadze 
welcomes the exhibitions, praises young scientists and 
entrepreneurs, and promises assistance] 
  [Oniani] And, finally, Batono Eduard, you yourself have said 
-- and it is frequently said -- that we have to declare war on 
the mafia and on saboteurs. But, unfortunately, cases of 
sabotage are still numerous. The authorities and 
law-enforcement bodies seem to be unable to combat this. If we 
add the social dimension to this, the question arises naturally: 
How long will things last like this? How long will this 
inactivity last? There are evident cases of sabotage which are 
not followed by any reaction. 
  [Shevardnadze] I would like to answer you like this. The 
fight against the mafia has begun and it will continue and its 
scale and pace will not reduce. Of course, it is not at all 
easy to eradicate the mafia or to supress it. This is not only 
a Georgian phenomenon. I should say that as one economic 
structure of a state is replaced by another, this is accompanied 
by the stirring up and establishment of mafiosi clans and then 
it is rather difficult to eliminate the clans. Mafiosi 
structures create a rather undesirable climate, if I may say so, 
even in highly developed countries. 
  We should come to the conclusion that we have to assist and 
care about law-enforcement bodies. Society should be mobilized. 
This process has commenced and thus stirred up hopes, I 
believe. We must support the people who do not tremble they 
talk about combating mafiosi clans. I want to declare that the 
pace of the fight will not decrease and I want to assure radio 
listeners of this. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 21, BNS -- A deputy leader of the 
opposition Coalition Party faction in the Estonian parliament 
and several other MP's [member of parliament] today accused 
Prime Minister Mart Laar of lying when characterizing the 
shortcomings discovered in the first consignments of weapons the 
country received under a major arms purchase deal from Israel. 
  Laar, answering a question by opposition Centrist Party MP 
Andra Veidemann before the parliament today said that the 
shortcomings discovered had been "not essential" and that they 
by no means negatively affected the combat effectiveness of the 
weapons. Laar said the faults in some cases, for instance, were 
just that a gun was having no bayonet or clip, or that plastic 
bottles and oilcan corks were partly missing. 
  "Those who claim that Estonia bought 60 million dollars 
worth 
of weapons that cannot be used are lying. None of the 
shortcomings discovered make it impossible to take the weapons 
into use," the premier said. 
  Laar said the supplier, the Israeli company TAAS, was to 
deliver the missing parts in the near future. 
  Coalition Party deputy leader and deputy head of the 
parliament's defense commission Peeter Lorents in his comments 
said he had seldom heard "such a brassy lie." He said the 
shortcomings discovered had been of much more serious character. 
For instance, none of the Israeli light mines tested in Estonia 
had properly worked, and a grenade shot from a antitank gun had 
fallen 1.5 meters lower than what was shown in product 
specifications. 
  The prime minister after Lorents' remarks said the MP should 
politely bring his apologies and choose his words in the future, 
and warned that in the opposite case legal action could be taken 
against him. 
  Centrist MP Olav Anton in his comments on Laar's explanation 
of the issue said "such kind of foggy talk the prime minister 
should use with his defense minister, who has not served in the 
army." 
  Opposition has also alleged that the old 23-millimeter 
anti-aircraft guns, found to be substandard by Estonian experts, 
were part of the arms deal and not simply a gift as was claimed 
later. 
  Israel's national company TAAS at the end of January brought 
as a gift to Estonia more than 20 million kroons worth of trophy 
weapons seized in its wars with the Soviet-backed Arab 
countries. The shipment included 23-millimeter Soviet-made 
guns, as well as RPD and PKT machine guns. 
  The prime minister today reasserted his claim that the 
shipment was a gift and stood apart from the arms deal. "The 
Israeli party feels the responsibility to bring into order the 
consignment delivered by it to Estonia," Laar said. 
  MP Juri Toomepuu claims he has seen the text of the 
agreement 
signed between Estonia and the Israeli company and that the 
document defines 23-millimeter guns as part of the deal. 
  Kuno Raude, chairman of the Rural Union party, in his 
remarks 
said that "each country has its honor and dignity, and in this 
case Estonia has been cheated."

<F P=106> [From 22 March RAHVA HAAL, PAEVALEHT, HOMMIKULEHT; "News </F>
Bulletin" No. 55/94] 
  [Text] Tuesday, March 22 -- Yesterday's questions and 
answers session was dominated by the Israeli weapons deal. 
Prime Minister Mart Laar and Commander in Chief Aleksander 
Einseln had to answer questions concerning their compatibility 
to the NATO standards and quality. 
  The Israeli-made small arms do not meet the STANAG 
agreements 
since Israel is not a member of the NATO, General Einseln 
explained. However, since the agreements concern primarily 
ammunition, the weapons can be considered as meeting the STANAG 
requirements, he stressed. Einseln added that the government 
had not approached him before on the NATO standards issue and 
the decision to purchase weapons from Israel had been made 
before he became Commander in Chief. 
  MP Andra Veidemann questioned Mart Laar on the incomplete 
weapons consignments and the premier claimed the drawbacks to be 
insignificant. Laar mentioned some missing cartridge clips and 
bayonets, stressed that this does not prevent the weapons from 
being used, and added that the Israeli company will supply the 
missing parts. Estonian experts will later check on the 
completeness of the consignments before they will be shipped to 
Estonia, Laar assured the parliament. 
  Further questions concerned the presented 23-millimetre 
anti-aircraft guns. Laar told the Riigikogu [parliament] that 
the decision had been made after an appeal by GHQ chief of staff 
Colonel Ants Laaneots during his visit to Israel last year. 
Laar claimed that the anti-aircraft guns as well as the machine 
guns had really been a present, outside the consignment which 
had been paid for. The Israeli supplier will help to repair the 
unusable weapons, he added. But the opposition members 
disagreed. Peeter Lorents claimed to have rarely heard "such a 
barefaced lie" as told by Laar and further explained that tests 
had disclosed more serious drawbacks with the weapons. He 
specifically mentioned defective mines and anti-tank ammunition. 
Lorents was seconded by MP Jiri Toomepuu, who claimed to have 
seen the original agreement, according to which the defective 
anti-aircraft guns were a part of the deal. They were supported 
by some other members - Centrist MP Olav Anton commented that 
only the Defence Minister, who has never served in the army, 
could believe such vague explanations. 
  Centrist MP Liina Tdnisson asked about the renting of the 
building in 3 Toompuiestee and Laar explained that the 
government had decided to hold an open auction. But he repeated 
that the government keeps supporting the idea of renting it to 
the company "Koneston", which intends to organise a Russian 
business centre there. 
  Laar rejected the claims that the mari airfield is being 
used 
for transporting stolen cars out of Estonia. The Estonian 
border guard is checking the leaving aircraft, he said. 
  Laar also explained that the government had decided to 
spread 
the funds of the national budget between different banks purely 
in order to cut the risks. He added that a closed contest will 
be held to determine the banks which will handle the funds next 
year. 
  Laar assured the parliament that the investigation of the 
cases when police officers mistreated Defence League members is 
continuing and Interior Minister Heiki Arike has been instructed 
to pursue the matter. But the names of most policemen who 
allegedly beat the volunteers are still unknown, Laar admitted. 
  The "Independents" faction of the Riigikogu elected Jaanus 
Raidal its chairman and Mart Niklus vice-chairman. Other 
members of the six-man faction are Ants Erm, Avo Kiir, Kalju 
Pdldvere and Toivo Uustalu. Raidal announced that the faction 
meeting approved a resolution to support the reinforcement of 
law and order in Estonia.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 21, BNS -- Picketing took place for 
the sixth Monday [21 March] in a row today in front of Russian 
naval garrison headquarters in Tallinn in protest against 
continuing presence of Russian troops in the country. 
  The pickets that are held now are a form of struggle against 
a colonial empire, said Juri Adams, deputy leader of the 
Estonian National Independence Party faction in the parliament. 
  MP [member of parliament] K. Jaak Roosaare called on the 
Russian military to come out of the house and speak before the 
picketers. The Estonian MP's appeal met with no response, 
however. 
  The Estonian National Independence Party has said the Monday 
pickets in front of the house that is situated just on the foot 
of the Toompea Hill, some 200 meters from the residence of the 
Estonian Government and the parliament, will continue until the 
last Russian soldier has left the country.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 21, BNS -- The leader of Estonia's 
opposition Coalition Party denied reports that the party had 
suggested to begin coalition talks with the governing Pro 
Patria, and added that a respective proposal had come from Pro 
Patria. 
  Coalition Party leader Tiit Vahi termed the noise created 
around possible cooperation between his party and the senior 
party in the governing coalition, the Pro Patria, as "hysteric" 
fuss. Those in Pro Patria, like (Prime Minister) Mart Laar, 
(Economics Minister) Toivo Jurgenson and MP Jaanus Betlem who 
are most actively opposed to possible cooperation apparently 
thought that if the other half of Pro Patria will reach an 
agreement with the Coalition Party, they will be left outside, 
Vahi said in an interview with BNS. 
  Vahi also dismissed as untrue the accusations that his party 
was dominated by former leaders of Communist state industries 
and collective farms. He said several members of the Coalition 
Party leadership, such as deputy head of the parliament's 
defense commission, Peeter Lorents, Tallinn Town Mayor Jaak 
Tamm, Ambassador Riivo Sinijarv and academy member Endel Lippmaa 
had never been members of the Communist party. Vahi said he 
himself had joined the Communist party in his time only to 
retain his post as chief engineer in a state company. 
  The Coalition Party leader also hit back at the accusers, 
saying things were not better with Pro Patria itself. He said 
the ruling party had promoted many enough former Communist youth 
organization activists and former Communist officials who are 
now sitting in the same offices that they occupied a few years 
ago when the central Tallinn house now used by a number of state 
institutions was still the Communist Party headquarters. 
  But Vahi also stated he will continue talks with politicians 
from Pro Patria who are concerned about what he called Estonia's 
bad standing in the fields of foreign, interior, defense and 
social policy. He said his party's cooperation with Pro Patria 
would be something that is absolutely normal. 
  Vahi's remarks came after a series of statements and 
eventual 
accusations in connection with possible changes in the 
coalitions scheme in view of next year's elections. 
  The Pro Patria board on March 14 issued a statement saying 
the party estimated the wish of the Social Democrats, the Rural 
Centrist Party, the Coalition Party and other political parties 
to cooperate with Pro Patria. 
  The deputy leader of Pro Patria's faction in the parliament, 
Karin Jaani, on March 15 told BNS cooperation between Pro Patria 
and the Coalition Party was not topical. She said Pro Patria 
was ready to hold talks with all political forces if necessary, 
but added that the party was having no intention to start 
coalition talks with the Coalition Party in the near future. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar, also the chairman of Pro Patria, 
said implementation of the policy of the Coalition Party would 
bring about a sharp rise in taxes and end the radical economic 
reform. "It is difficult for Pro Patria to find things in common 
with 'red' directors and former collective farm leaders," Laar 
said.

  [Text] The economic police is to bring charges of 
mismanagement against Director General of the Estonian Radio 
Herkki Haldre in the nearest future, Commissar of the economic 
police Jaak Hindriksson said. Haldre will be charged with the 
waste of state funds. The State Inspection Office accused the 
radio management in paying excessive wages and meeting 
questionable travel expenses. 
  The situation is complicated by a legal inadequacy since 
there is no legal procedure for dismissing the head of the 
radio. The national broadcasting statute stipulates that the 
radio is subordinated to the "Presidium of the Supreme Soviet", 
a body that no longer exists, while no document determines the 
relations of the radio director and the Riigikogu. Chairman of 
the parliamentary culture commission Sulev Alajde explained that 
the commission may recommend the Riigikogu to approve a new law 
on broadcasting and to keep Haldre in office for the time being. 
  Haldre is currently abroad and the Estonian Radio is headed 
by Paul Himma.

  [Text] Lvov March 21 TASS -- Ukraine does not want to be a 
buffer between the East and West. It wants to be an equal 
partner, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told a news 
conference in Lvov, western Ukraine, on Monday. 
  The minister made a stopover in Lvov on his way from the 
Czech Republic to Poland where he will discuss the Partnership 
for Peace Programme. 
  Zlenko pointed out that Ukraine is interested in expanding 
regional and sub-regional cooperation, particularly with the 
Carpathian region, and joining the Visegrad group which unites 
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. 
  The minister said that the opinion that Ukraine is not 
welcome in Europe is wrong, adding that after Poland he will fly 
to Brussels to sign an agreement on cooperation with the 
European Union. "Ukraine can and will cooperate with Western 
states. It has a potential for equal cooperation. There is 
also a reciprocal interest among the European powers," he said.

  [Text] Warsaw, 21 Mar -- UNIAN has reported that Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko on 21 March began his visit to 
the Republic of Poland. On the same day he had a tete-a-tete 
conversation with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. 
According to some information, they discussed the two sides' 
views on the Partnership for Peace program joined by the two 
states. After this, the foreign ministers signed a declaration 
on the principles of forming Ukrainian-Polish partnership and an 
agreement on protecting the graves and places in memory of 
victims of war and reprisals. 
  Commenting on the results of the Ukrainian-Polish 
negotiations and the agreement signed, Ukrainian Ambassador to 
Poland Hennadiy Udovenko stated to a UNIAN correspondent that 
the documents signed did not signify a union between Ukraine and 
Poland. They did, however, make the declaration of strategic 
partnership more specific. The ambassador's view is that 
"Ukrainian-Polish relations are at a stage of stagnation and are 
in need of a fresh impetus," in view of which he categorically 
opposed the opinion of some of the Polish mass media that the 
minister's visit was inexpedient ahead of the elections to 
Ukraine's parliament. He considers the visit very topical 
indeed. 
  Answering the UNIAN correspondent's question on whether the 
issue of Ukraine possibly joining the France-Germany-Poland 
geopolitical axis was discussed at the meeting, the ambassador 
stated Ukraine was interested in this issue but Poland had not 
decided yet.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Dolinin report: "For Civilized Countries </F>
Missiles Are Not a Bargaining Chip"] 
  [Text] Two missile regiments stationed on Belorussian 
[Belarusian] territory in Mozyr and Lida have started to 
withdraw their weapons and military hardware to Russian 
territory. 
  A grouping of Strategic Missile Forces comprising two 
missile 
divisions is currently stationed on Belorussian territory. They 
include 8 missile regiments armed with RS-12M Topol road-mobile 
missile complexes. The total number of missile launchers is 72. 
  Under this year's jointly agreed timetable, one-half of 
these 
will be withdrawn from Belorussia [Belarus] to Russia, and the 
rest will follow by the end of next year. By the middle of 1996 
the Mozyr and Lida Divisions will be completely disbanded. All 
the missile troops' military bases and housing compounds will be 
handed over to the Belorussian side. We already have experience 
of this work. Last summer nine missile launchers were withdrawn 
from Postavy to Russia following close cooperation between the 
Russian and Belorussian sides. 
  What will happen to the "Belorussian" nuclear weapons next? 
The weapons and military hardware that are being withdrawn will 
be held at Strategic Missile Forces arsenals in Russia, where 
they will subsequently be used as an exchange fund to replace 
weapons that have reached the end of their service life in 
missile regiments on combat alert in Russia. 
  What does the future hold for the missile troops themselves? 
Lieutenant General Viktor Yesyan, chief of the Strategic Missile 
Forces Headquarters Operations Directorate, said that they would 
serve in Russian units that are currently undermanned. Officers 
and warrant officers who have expressed a desire to remain in 
Belorussia will be discharged from the ranks of the Russian 
Armed Forces. Their status has been defined by a special 
agreement between the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and 
the Republic of Belarus Ministry of Defense regarding the 
procedure for performance of military service by officers, 
ensigns, and warrant officers. This agreement has been approved 
by the Russian and Belarusian Governments and is being 
rigorously implemented. Officers and warrant officers who used 
to serve in the Strategic Missile Forces and who remain in 
Belorussia will enjoy all the rights of citizens of this 
republic. There have been no cases of encroachment on these 
rights.

Unification?"] 
  [Text] On 18 March, at a behind-closed-doors session of 
the Belarusian parliament, Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich 
stated that Russia has decreased the price for gas for our 
republic, and called it a practical step toward the unification 
of monetary systems. 
  By now, the value of 1,000 cubic meters of gas is equal to 
$50 instead of $80. This change was introduced effective 1 
January 1994. In the effect of recalculation, Belarus' debt to 
Russian suppliers decreased by 150 billion rubles [R]. However, 
the opposition's reaction was skeptical. As RID was told by 
People's Deputy Sergey Naumchik, the only thing for free is 
cheese in the mousetrap. It follows from this that shady deals 
are still being arranged behind people's backs.

  [Text] Kaliningrad, Russia, Mar 21, BNS -- The arrest of 
Vladas Laurinavicius, president of the Kaunas-based Selma 
association, is a provocation and can be regarded as sabotage, 
former Lithuanian Defense Minister Audrius Butkevicius told BNS 
Sunday [20 March]. 
  Laurinavicius was arrested Thursday night when some 40 
searches were carried out in apartments of present and former 
Defense Ministry officials, including Butkevicius. The searches 
were carried out in relation to the investigation of financial 
violations in the purchase of weapons for Lithuanian defense 
forces in 1992-1993. Laurinavicius acted as a mediator in these 
weapon deals. 
  In Butkevicius' opinion, the arrest means that certain 
forces 
in Lithuania want to ruin the association's joint project with 
the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet to build housing in the Kaliningrad 
region for Russian military personnel withdrawing from the 
Baltic states. 
  The ex-minister said the project created 3,000 new jobs for 
Lithuania and the number was supposed to increase to 5,000 in 
the near future. Butkevicius said a new contract had to be 
signed Saturday during Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's 
visit to the region, but Laurinavicius was arrested. 
  The former minister said the Lithuanian state budget already 
recovered 70 percent of the money that Lithuania invested in the 
Baltflot-Selma project. Butkevicius said the project would have 
been very useful to Lithuania because an agreement on oil 
supplies to Lithuania was supposed to be signed together with 
the new building contract. In his words, Grachev brought the 
agreement to Kaliningrad. 
  Butkevicius said during his service as defense minister he 
thought Lithuania should become "an intermediate point for the 
transit of goods from the West to the East." The best way to 
implement this concept is to maintain good relations with all 
neighboring countries, he said. "It's a pity that the present 
policy may deviate from the way we chose." 
  The ex-minister said the Lithuanian Government and 
parliamentary commissions carefully checked three times whether 
plans to build apartments for Russian servicemen are politically 
and economically useful to Lithuania. 
  In Butkevicius' words, people who disagree with his concept 
chose "the easiest way -- to defame the participants of the 
project." 
  The former minister said the supposed oil supplies to 
Lithuania were used as a pretext for a provocation. Butkevicius 
said Selma built houses in the region on credit for 1.5 years 
but oil would have rehabilitated the association in the eyes of 
the Lithuania public, as well as Estonia and Latvia. In his 
opinion, oil supplies would have become a basis for "further 
fruitful cooperation between Lithuania and Russia."

<F P=106> [Report by Captain First Class Valeriy Gromak: "Political </F>
Provocation: Why the Selma-Baltflot Project Is In Jeopardy"] 
  [Text] One stage of Defense Minister Army General Pavel 
Grachev's work in Kaliningrad Oblast was supposed to have been a 
visit to a construction site in north Kaliningrad where the 
Lithuanian association Selma is building homes for Russian 
officers. 
  At the present day the Lithuanian construction workers have 
already prepared a complex of five multiapartment blocks for 
handing over and are completing the assembly of another four 
buildings. Not only has the implementation of the plan helped 
Lithuania to resolve some economic problems and created some new 
jobs, it has also had a considerable impact on the timing and 
pace of the Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia. 
Army Gen. Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, and 
Audrius Butkevicius, former Lithuanian minister of national 
defense, are rightly considered the founding fathers of the 
Selma-Baltflot project. Unfortunately, during his trip the 
Russian defense minister was unable to visit the Selma 
construction site. "The fact is," Army Gen. Pavel Grachev told 
journalists, "that someone in the Lithuanian leadership (I do 
not know who at the moment) has conceived the idea of preventing 
a meeting between the Russian defense minister and Vladas 
Laurikavicius, president of the Selma company." 
  On the eve of the meeting with the Russian defense minister 
in Kaliningrad, the Selma president was arrested by the 
Lithuanian special services and taken to Vilnius, where he has 
been placed in a detention cell. 
  "This fact will not help Russo-Lithuanian relations," Army 
Gen. Pavel Grachev told journalists. "Selma had faith in us and 
still does, it worked essentially on credit using its own 
resources. The Selma president was told that I was bringing a 
directive from the Russian Government outlining the terms on 
which we would settle our debts. I brought them a barter deal 
-- for oil. I have this directive in my briefcase but I cannot 
give it to the association's president or thank him for his 
work...." 
  Here is the opinion of Povilas Astasiavicius, vice president 
of the Selma company. 
  "Certain forces in Lithuania do not like what we are doing," 
he said. "Recently the Lithuanian press has waged an unbridled 
campaign accusing us of a variety of sins: They say that we are 
not building anything but are just getting rich. But you can 
see the homes that we have built, you can see the people who 
have already been given apartments in those blocks.... This 
whole campaign is being fuelled primarily by Mr. Piatkiavicius, 
a deputy in the Seimas...." 
  However, I find this particular maneuver by certain 
political 
forces in Lithuania all the more incomprehensible because Mr. 
Piatkiavicius was the leader of the first official Lithuanian 
parliamentary delegation to visit this construction site in the 
summer of last year. It was he, when opening the rally 
dedicated to the completion of the assembly of the first 
building, who spoke a lot about the need to develop good 
neighborly relations between Lithuania and Russia and promised 
comprehensive support for the Selma-Baltflot project. 
  But now he holds the opposite view.... Last Sunday I met 
with Audrius Butkevicius, Lithuania's former national defense 
minister, and asked him to comment on what has happened. 
  "My apartment was also searched," Butkevicius said. "They 
were looking for explosives, which is really ridiculous. They 
also wanted to plant some documents on me which were nothing to 
do with me. Here, too, I express solidarity with Pavel 
Sergeyevich Grachev: The arrest of Laurikavicius is an act of 
provocation. A political provocation! And I very much regret 
that the Lithuanian side is to blame for this."

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 22, BNS -- Normal relations with 
Poland are "an indispensable condition" for Lithuania's 
integration with the European Union, Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas said in his regular Monday [21 March] radio 
spot this week. 
  Replying to criticism directed against the Polish-Lithuanian 
political treaty that was initialed in Warsaw last Friday, 
Brazauskas suggested his political opponents to think whether 
"we are moving toward the future, or do we live only in memories 
of the past." 
  The treaty is sharply criticized by certain political forces 
in Lithuania because it does not mention the 1920 occupation of 
Vilnius and its region by Poland. 
  The Lithuanian president expressed hope that "our nation 
will 
have enough common sense and vital strength to go beyond this 
limit. 
  "We must see the future instead of choosing only historical 
evaluations and trying to determine our relations with a 
neighboring state through that prism." Brazauskas noted, 
however, that "nobody will forget history." 
  The president recalled the post-war experience of Western 
Europe where former enemies started to create the EU only ten 
years after World War II. Brazauskas said people in these 
countries and their leaders tried to be tolerant and to 
cooperate with neighbors. "Our policy is the same and we will 
adhere to it."

  Earlier some Lithuanian politicians voiced their discontent

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 21 March in its "Details" program carries 
a report on talks between correspondent Nikolay Svanidze and 
Valentin Zorkin, member of the Constitutional Court, about the 
latest reports of an alleged coup d'etat. Svanidze begins with 
the following: "Hello! Details continue to focus on versions of 
a coup d'etat that have been circulating in Moscow over the past 
few days, the objective being the overthrow of President 
Yeltsin. I say versions, because until recently people had been 
talking about one, and now we have a second -- version number 
two -- which is a virtual twin of version number one, but more 
detailed. It contains the same list of names of the plotters: 
Soskovets; Luzhkov; General Staff chief Kolesnikov; and Deputy 
Defense Minister Kokoshin. In comparison with the first 
version, the list also includes Kvasov, head of the government 
apparatus. However, there are certain reservations about 
participation in the plot by Skokov and Shumeyko. Moreover, in 
comparison with the first version, it says that a plot is 
possible after spring of this year. Well, like the first 
version, behind the backs of the plotters lurks the figure of 
Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin. 
  "If one takes the thinking of the authors of the document to 
its logical conclusion, an attempt on Yeltsin is being prepared 
by the hierarchy of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Federation 
Council, the Moscow administration, and a powerful section of 
the army leadership, with the well-disposed neutrality of other 
power ministries. If one takes these anonymous notes on trust, 
then President Yeltsin will clearly remain alone. He will 
weaken and try to obtain satisfaction from his last days in the 
office of president. Thus, it would be impossible to counter a 
powerful alliance of the above-mentioned figures and state 
structures. But if not everything in these notes is true -- 
which is more than probable in view of the complex relations of 
the above-mentioned people among themselves and their very 
doubtful interest in Yeltsin's removal -- then a whole number of 
questions remain. The main one of these: why are anonymous 
letters of this kind appearing now?" 
  Svanidze then turns to Valeriy Zorkin, member of the 
Constitutional Court, and asks who he thinks might gain from all 
this. Zorkin says he believes it is those who do not reckon 
with realities and believe the country can be brought back from 
the abyss by junta-type coups. If those who elaborated all this 
believe that they can carry out a "palace junta," Zorkin says, 
they are sadly disillusioned. Zorkin says he proposes another 
"version" where effective power should be linked with national 
accord. 
  Svanidze wonders how real the possibility of a peaceful 
outcome of the crisis is and if there can really be accord in 
Russia in the foreseeable future. Zorkin believes that the 
existing institutions of power must be strengthened and that one 
must do everything to make society concentrate around 
presidential power, which is the only real capable institution. 
  Svanidze notes that "all the politicians named in the 
documents represent the pragmatic center. Some of these -- 
Luzhkov, Shumeyko, and Chernomyrdin -- are possible strong 
candidates for the president's chair. A most probable task of 
their opponents is to cast aspersions on them." 
  Svanidze asks Zorkin why he decided to become a member of 
such movements with the word "accord" in them. Zorkin says 
there is nothing strange or odious in joining such movements if 
you believe in what they stand for. But this is not what it is 
at issue, Zorkin says. It is true there are a number of people 
in these movements who may be called centrists, he says. What 
we must do is to find a delicate combination between democracy 
and authoritarianism on the basis of accord and clearly set-out 
rules with a social treaty of the whole people, Zorkin says. 
  Svanidze notes: "According to an INTERFAX report, Aleksey 
Ilyushenko, acting Russian procurator general, today issued an 
amendment to a report regarding the intention to carry out a 
coup d'etat. According to Ilyushenko, the procuracy general is 
prepared to institute criminal proceedings on accusations of 
slander in combination with charges of a state crime. Members 
of the general procuracy, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and 
the federal counterintelligence service will be brought into the 
investigation."

<F P=106> [Feature comprising comments by State Duma deputy Sergey </F>
Yushenkov and Russian Federation Minister of Nationalities 
Affairs and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray, plus unattributed 
"Stop Press" paragraph under the general heading "Spring. 
Bursting Buds and Coup Rumors": "Cui Bono?"] 
  [Text] Sergey Yushenkov (State Duma deputy): 
  The destabilization of society currently benefits those who 
one way or another found themselves excluded from the State Duma 
on 12 December. They are dreaming of revenge following the 
October events. I wish to say that dozens of similar coup 
theories are currently in circulation. 
  Judge for yourself: Why would Chernomyrdin want a coup when 
he has more power than anyone else in the country? As for 
Skokov, he's a busted flush.... And in general the very 
selection of "coup participants" is so inconsistent! When I 
heard about this I went up to Poltoranin and said: "How could 
you dare to prepare such a coup?" He laughed: "If I'd been 
doing the organizing I'd have done it properly...." 
  Sergey Shakhray (Russian federation minister): 
  I'm inclined to regard this as well-organized 
disinformation. 
Skillfully done, but not corresponding to reality. I think that 
the main purpose of the "leak" is to increase the president's 
suspicion toward his last political support (representatives of 
virtually all political forces have been lumped together in the 
circle of "conspirators") and bring discord into their 
relationship. 
  Another purpose is to stir up society and clear the way in 
the public mind for a third force. The result has been 
achieved. It was professionally done -- you can sense the hand 
of the Security Ministry or the Main Intelligence Directorate. 
In my view the president himself has no interest in such a 
"leak." 
  Stop Press: KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA sources in the White House 
have informed us that, according to the official story, the 
White House telephones are silent because of repairmen who 
inadvertently broke a cable. In their view it will take another 
two days to repair the line.

  [Text] Sochi, 22 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin left Sochi by air for Moscow this afternoon. 
Speaking to journalists prior to his departure from Sochi 
airport, the head of the cabinet described the fabrications 
about a deterioration in the Russian president's health as 
"insulting." 
  The prime minister strongly denied recent rumors that Boris 
Yeltsin's health has sharply deteriorated. "Yesterday Boris 
Nikolayevich and I did almost four hours' work together. The 
work was continued this morning," Viktor Chernomyrdin said. "We 
resolved a whole series of questions -- both economic and 
political -- and discussed the situation in the south of the 
country." "Somebody has an interest in destabilizing the 
situation," he stressed.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- Yet another "top Russian 
official", who was said to be involved in an alleged coup 
planned to oust Boris Yeltsin, denied the accusations calling 
them a "clumsy political joke". 
  "I laughed when I saw my name among the (coup) plotters", 
Mikhail Poltoranin, a former aide of the president and currently 
the chairman of the State Duma commission on information policy, 
told TASS on Tuesday. 
  The OBSHCHAYA GAZETA said last week Poltorainin and several 
other top officials were involved in plotting to oust the 
president. The office of the Russian prosecutor general said it 
was checking whether the report corresponds to reality and 
threatened to bring criminal charges against the newspaper if 
the information turned out to be false. 
  Poltoranin said that the report was "especially silly", all 
names listed there were politically incompatible and plans 
unrealistic. He said he was confused by the fact that the 
Russian press paid so much attention to the report. "Only 
limited and incompetent people can get on such a bait", he 
stressed. 
  On Monday another "plotter" denied his involvement in the 
"coup". First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets asked the 
prosecutor's office to clear up the accusations against him. 
Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov was also on the list. He was the 
first to deny the allegations in a Sunday TV interview.

  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- "First Vice-Premier Oleg 
Soskovets has not officially complained to the 
procurator-general's office against the article `Buds Swelling. 
For a New Putsch?', published in the 11th issue of the 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA here last Friday," says a statement by the 
first vice-premier's press secretary, forwarded to ITAR-TASS 
today. (The article said that Soskovets was a member of an 
allegedly existing "group of state leaders" wishing to remove 
Boris Yeltsin from power -- ITAR-TASS). 
  "In principle, he has no intention of reacting in any way to 
such publications," the statement says. 
  "At the same time, I must express concern on behalf of the 
first vice-premier in connection with attempts to split our 
society asunder, to sow discord within the state-governing 
structures, among prominent politicians and public leaders. 
Such attempts directly contradict the tendency towards concord, 
gaining strength in our society, which was created by President 
Yeltsin's recent initiatives," the document stresses. 
  "Oleg Soskovets believes that the consolidation of civil 
peace will be promoted also by the government-planned measures 
to stabilise the economy and increase the social character of 
the ongoing reforms," the press secretary says in his official 
document. "The way to consolidate and develop Russia lies 
through the cooperation of all the organs of power, all the 
political parties, public movements and social groups. The 
first vice-premier, just as other members of the government, 
regards our president as the guarantor of peace, tranquility and 
stability in the country."

  [Text] Aleksandr Rutskoy has described as a farce and 
deception the rumors about preparations for a coup d'etat in 
connection with the appearance in the press of an anonymous 
document with a possible scenario of such an action. According 
to him, the situation is being especially dramatized in order to 
divert people's attention. He stated this during a visit to an 
agricultural fair on the territory of the All-Russian Exhibition 
Center, our correspondent Marina Chernukha reports. At the same 
time Aleksandr Rutskoy remarked that anything could be expected 
in the present situation, but he declared that, God forbid, he 
should again go through events like those of October 1993. 
Aleksandr Rutskoy is convinced that the situation in the 
country can be put right; what this needs is to ensure the 
control of the state, to determine the priorities of the 
development of the economy, to create stimuli for their 
realization, and to observe the laws.

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "Aleksandr Rutskoy: I Want To Run </F>
for President, and Soon"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- The Japanese KYODO agency has circulated an 
interview with Rutskoy through its channels. As the Japanese 
would have it, this is well nigh the first policy utterance by 
the amnestied bearded leader since his stay in Lefortovo 
[Prison]. 
  Rutskoy informs the Japanese that he is ready for the 
struggle for the post of Russian president and does not intend 
to leave the political arena. The leader notes without false 
modesty here that he has sufficient strength and experience to 
successfully conduct an election campaign and then lead Russia. 
Rutskoy attributes this uncommon self-confidence to the fact 
that he is virtually insured against making major political 
mistakes in the future because in the past Yeltsin has taught 
him clear lessons in a specific discipline: how not to run the 
country. 
  Having received such a valuable "inoculation," the amnestied 
figure gave the Japanese to understand that in order to achieve 
his aims he intends to form a powerful united patriotic front, 
which will be his mainstay in the election and bring him to 
power. Judging from his replies his allies in the struggle will 
be communists and other patriotic forces whose potential the 
leader has to utilize effectively. Rutskoy also called for the 
voluntary reunification of former Soviet republics in a new 
union, noting the objective need for such integration. 
  The recent inmate of Leforotovo inveighs against Yeltsin in 
strong and varied terms. In addition, Rutskoy curses the West 
and the world community as a whole for the support given to the 
present Russian president in October last year. Rutskoy 
stresses here that he does not consider himself a criminal. On 
the contrary, he calls himself a true defender of the law and 
constitution and is puzzled as to how foreign observers -- in 
whose eyes "those who shot innocent people" are still reformers 
-- were unable to discern this. 
  The former vice president informed the Japanese that he is 
currently very busy finishing off his latest book with the 
epoch-making title "Ways of Reforming Russia in All Key Areas." 
  A scientific-sounding title, but judging from the author's 
explanations the book, which is due to come out as early as this 
summer, will describe not only the mysteries of reform but also 
backstage Kremlin intrigues in 1991-1993. Rutskoy promises to 
spill the beans about his relations with Yeltsin and to cite 
other juicy details from the life of the political elite. 
  In a short commentary on Rutskoy's written replies, KYODO 
indicates the high probability that a Russian presidential 
election should be expected not in 1996, when Yeltsin's term of 
office officially expires, but before that -- next year or even 
at the end of this year.

  [Text] Valeriy Zorkin, formerly chairman of the Russian 
Constitutional Court (CC) and today an ordinary CC judge, said 
his signing of an appeal for setting up an accord for Russia 
movement was "undoubtedly a political act." 
  Thereby Zorkin, in an interview with Interfax on Monday, 
expressed agreement with a statement by the other CC members, 
who Monday accused him of breaking the law on the status of a 
judge by pursuing political activities and demanded that he 
choose between politics and the judiciary. 
  Zorkin told Interfax he would make his choice very soon, but 
said his CC colleagues should hardly have slammed him for doing 
something "aimed at restoring the constitutional system." 
  Dismissal of any CC judge would make no sense these days 
anyway, for the court "hasn't been operating for the past half 
year," so "the judges have been suspended anyway. It seemed to 
me that the signing of the appeal for the new movement, Accord 
for Russia, would bring forward the moment when the 
Constitutional Court started to operate again," Zorkin said. 
  Meanwhile, acting CC chairman Nikolay Vitruk told reporters 
Monday that the CC judges had unanimously qualified Zorkin's 
step as political and contradicting his status as a judge. 
Thereby "Zorkin again tried to create a conflict situation in 
the court. But he didn't manage to do that. We are not against 
his act as such, because it is aimed at conciliation in society, 
but one must act by legal means," Vitruk said. He said most of 
the judges who had formerly supported Zorkin "this time 
suggested that he resign." 
  Vitruk said the law made no provision for dismissing a 
judge, 
but expressed the hope that Zorkin would quit voluntarily.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin violated the Russian 
Constitution when accepting the resignation of Former Prosecutor 
General Aleksandr Kazannik and appointing the acting prosecutor 
general. This was said by a Federation Council deputy, a leader 
of the Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc, Yuriy Boldyrev, at a press 
conference in St. Petersburg on Friday. 
  The Federation Council did not raise the issue on violation 
of the Constitution by the president since 54 percent of the 
Federation Council's deputies are also employees of other 
legislative bodies, Deputy Boldyrev suggested. 
  According to Deputy Boldyrev, the freeing of Former Vice 
President Rutskoy and Former Parliament's Speaker Khasbulatov 
from the Lefortovo prison was in the interests of the 
president's team. Boldyrev suggested that while in prison they 
had been regarded as victims and that it would be much more 
difficult for them to maintain their authority when free. 
  Deputy Boldyrev condemned the State Duma's resolution on 
economic amnesty. He said no amnesty was needed to free people 
whose actions were today not considered criminal. The 
appropriate provision in the Criminal Code would be sufficient 
for this, he added. 
  "Those who abused their powers are now also freed due to the 
economic amnesty," Deputy Boldyrev said. He stressed that the 
amnesty would not lay the foundation for civil accord.

"Russia Threatened With Accord Bolshevik-Style. Future of 
Economic Reform Is Very Hazy"] 
  [Text] The week of the president's absence on vacation has 
seen the return to use in Russia of a word that is politically 
not in the first flush of youth, a word well and truly worn with 
futile overuse -- "accord." Boris Yeltsin put it into 
circulation by organizing the formulation of the Memorandum on 
Civil Accord. 
  But accord between and with whom? If it is accord between 
Russian citizens (why else should it be called "civil" accord?), 
the bulk of these citizens do not seem overly worried about 
putting up barricades. There are no signs of any intense 
emotion anywhere, no apparent upheaval -- which does credit to 
not only the people's tremendous long-suffering but also their 
common sense. 
  We are of course talking about accord among political 
forces. 
As predicted, the opposing parties and movements have their own 
ideas of this accord and their own means of achieving it. While 
a working group comprising representatives of the presidential 
administration, the government, the Moscow Patriarchate, the 
leadership of the State Duma, the Federation Council, and the 
Constitutional Court is preparing a draft memorandum, opposition 
leaders have already presented theirs. And they have founded 
without lengthy disputes the "Accord for Russia" movement, which 
observers have viewed as the opening of a second National 
Salvation Front. 
  Rutskoy, Lukyanov, Prokhanov, Zyuganov, Zorkin, Chikin, 
Tuleyev, Baburin, and Govorukhin (the declaration carries 14 
signatures in all) are proposing a "social contract among all 
patriotic forces and movements that deny violence, racism, and 
nationalism." 
  This retaliatory "peace initiative" is reminiscent of a 
counterclaim. The Communists and the patriots are prepared to 
seek accord solely on their own political territory, as Gennadiy 
Zyuganov said with party-minded bluntness at the 15 March 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive 
Committee plenum: "During the voting in the Duma in favor of 
the Memorandum of Accord the Communist faction also came up with 
further conditions that are essential for national 
reconciliation." Namely, a change in the socioeconomic course, a 
socialist path of development, the restoration of the union 
state, etc. 
  Opposition leaders are hardly giving way to illusions: No 
accord other than accord between Prokhanov and Zyuganov, Rutskoy 
and Lukyanov, Baburin and Govorukhin can be secured on these 
terms. However, it is easy to ensure that the party economic 
nomenklatura returns to power at local level on these terms, as 
the provincial election campaign reminded us this week. The 
idea of electing the president not by national ballot but by a 
kind of new Zemskiy Sobor [ancient council of nobles] comprising 
members of the Federation Council and representatives of the 
territories can be developed on these terms -- an idea that has 
been abandoned like a trial balloon. In these areas the 
president's opponents have been extremely successful over the 
last few days and have effectively encountered no resistance 
from the president's supporters. 
  The four-day Duma discussion of the president's message also 
provided a reminder of the agglomerations and obstacles in the 
way of political accord. Finally, after two meetings, the 
conciliation commission comprising members of various factions 
and deputies' groups formulated a document which has won the 
approval of a Duma majority. Deputies in the Federation Council 
were meanwhile fighting an exhausting campaign for their powers, 
saying that they alone had the right to dismiss the general 
prosecutor and not the president -- and there were no signs of 
accord with the latter here. 
  Last, there was also a street gathering of dissenters -- a 
17 
March rally on Moscow's Theater Square organized by the National 
Salvation Front and the "Revival" and "Working Moscow" movements 
to mark the third anniversary of the all-Union referendum on the 
future of the USSR. 
  However, virtually everything that happened in the 
parliamentary chambers, on the square, everywhere that saw 
political rallies this week was accompanied by calls for civil 
peace. 
  The political result of the past week must be deemed to be 
the appreciable consolidation of antireform forces rejecting 
broad civil accord or prepared to secure it only on their own 
terms, which they know to be unacceptable to democratic parties 
and movements. The latter's equally obvious passivity at this 
time is enabling "Accord for Russia" to form an organization 
that can pool its efforts in the fight for power.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina report specially </F>
for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Three Options in Quest for Truth. 
Which One Will Supreme Court Choose?"] 
  [Text] The investigation into the State Committee for the 
State of Emergency [SCSE] case is the way to establish the 
historical truth, Yuriy Baturin, an aide to the Russian 
president, believes. 
  "If the renewed judicial investigation into the SCSE case is 
brought to an end once again, it will have major moral 
repercussions for society. Society will be led away from the 
quest for the historical truth." This position was voiced in an 
interview with this ITAR-TASS correspondent by Yuriy Baturin, 
the Russian president's national security aide. And he 
particularly emphasized in the conversation that his opinion 
should in no way be interpreted as pressuring the Supreme Court. 
  Baturin's fears in connection with the emergence of new 
"blank spots" in the country's history are based on the fact 
that in the prevailing situation -- whereby the SCSE members 
have been granted an amnesty in violation of Article 5 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, following which this decision was 
repealed by the Military Collegium -- at the stage of the 
scheduled new judicial investigation, three options are 
possible: either the search for the truth is continued until a 
conviction or acquittal is gained, after which the amnesty would 
come into force; or the case is sent for additional 
investigation; or the case is closed. 
  "If the Supreme Court takes the first option it will trigger 
a new judicial investigation. This would mean restoring 
legality and continuing the search for the truth. Then we could 
take our hat off to the Supreme Court," Yuriy Baturin said. 
  The second option -- of sending the case back for additional 
investigation -- would mean that the prosecutor's office would 
again study 150 bulky volumes of evidence. 
  The third option would be to close the case at the new stage 
in light of the legitimate ground of the act of amnesty. "This 
may be a well-conceived way of legitimately closing the case 
illegally," was how Baturin put it, since, although it was 
illegal to close the case in the course of the judicial 
investigation, the law does not prevent this now that a new 
investigation is in preparation.

  [Text] [Announcer Irina Merkulova] A closed session of the 
lower house's Committee on International Affairs was held at the 
State Duma today. It was attended by Yevgeniy Primakov, 
director of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS]. In an 
interview with our correspondent, Yuriy Kobaladze, the head of 
the FIS's Press Bureau, described the aim of this meeting in the 
following terms: 
  [Begin Kobaladze recording] This is normal international 
practice. This was simply a way of telling MP's what the 
intelligence service is doing, the tasks it is facing, and the 
way it is tackling them. [end recording] 
  [Merkulova] At the same time, our correspondent learned the 
following: 
  [Begin Correspondent Aleksey Venediktov recording] Moscow 
Echo's sources say that in his address, Primakov referred to 
certain inconsistencies between the Constitution adopted on 12 
December and the law on foreign intelligence. However, arms 
exports were the main topic. Primakov expressed conviction that 
arms sales must be controlled by a single monopoly, 
Rosvooruzheniye, rather than several firms competing among 
themselves. The FIS director said that arms exports could earn 
the country substantial profits -- and not just in Russia's 
traditional markets. 
  He stressed that Russia's intelligence service had observed 
a 
drawing together of the positions of Iran and Turkey, both in 
Afghanistan and the Transcaucasus. 
  Referring to the United States' stance on various questions, 
Primakov noted that according to his information, the United 
States supports Belarus' entry into the ruble zone and advocates 
the preservation of Russia's unity. 
  According to our sources, the hearings on foreign 
intelligence were more reminiscent of a scholarly seminar than a 
chance for MP's to learn about state secrets. However, the 
important thing is that the first contact has been established, 
our sources stressed. [end recording] 
  [Merkulova] Yuriy Kobaladze reacted in the following manner 
when we asked him to confirm or deny that information: 
  [Begin Kobaladze recording] I cannot comment on those 
points. 
If Duma sources supply you with such information, you should 
quote Duma sources. 
  [Merkulova] Let me add that the State Duma's Committee on 
International Affairs also refused to comment. It advised that 
this report should not even be broadcast.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dimitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the </F>
Russian Federation Committee for the Management of State 
Property, by Sophie Gherardi; place, date not given: "Seventy 
Percent of Russian Industry Will Be Privatized Within Three 
Months"] 
  [Text] Dimitriy Vasilyev, around 30 years old and from St. 
Petersburg like his boss Anatoliy Chubays (Russia's 
privatization chief), is deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federation's Committee for the Management of State Property. 
For four years, he has been working against the odds for the 
transfer to private ownership of the Russian production 
apparatus. His tactic, which is not very "capitalist" (150 
million coupons have been distributed to citizens who invest 
them as they wish in auction sales) has managed to create 
millions of small shareholders. It absolutely must end on 30 
June 1994. On that date, the transfer of property will 
theoretically have been achieved, but the enterprises' problems 
will still exist. 
  [Gherardi] Does the new political configuration in Russia 
endanger the privatization process? 
  [Vasilyev] I do not think so. The people all have 
privatization coupons, and now they feel they own something. No 
political party dares to call that into question. Of course, 
there is no lack of critics: the Communists and Centrists, for 
instance, say that the military-industrial complex and land 
should not be privatized. But President Yeltsin has never 
stopped expressing support for privatization. The proof of this 
is that the Committee for the Management of State Property 
chaired by Anatoliy Chubays has remained in place. 
  [Gherardi] And what is the public's attitude? 
  [Vasilyev] I would say that there is "quiet support" for the 
privatizations. The people find that things are not moving 
quickly enough, those in remote provinces are insisting that 
they should not be left out. We have tried to move closer to 
them with our 90 regional committees. It is true that there is 
frustration, especially among those who squandered their coupon 
at the start. 
  [Gherardi] How did they lose them? 
  [Vasilyev] We distributed one coupon per person (in other 
words around 150 million coupons), with a face value of 10,000 
rubles [R] (Footnote 1) ($1 equals R1,600. The sum of R10,000 
is more a convention than a price), but sold for the symbolic 
sum of R25. Some preferred to immediately exchange their coupon 
for cash -- or vodka. Others made a bad investment and are 
regretting it. But a coupon market was very quickly established: 
The rate stagnated at around R5,000 until mid-1993 and then 
rose to almost R30,000 after the October events (Footnote 2) 
(The attack on the rebel Parliament) and returned to between 
R20,000 and R25,000 in recent weeks. 
  [Gherardi] What means do the Russians have for judging the 
enterprises in which they invest? 
  [Vasilyev] There are information campaigns in the newspapers 
and on television. But it is primarily by word of mouth. The 
enterprises in the energy, oil, and food processing sectors are 
very successful, as are hotel chains or stores. On the other 
hand, the public does not really like the firms in the 
military-industrial complex. 
  [Gherardi] What is the status of privatization operations? 
  [Vasilyev] They are progressing very rapidly. Around half 
of the industrial apparatus has already been privatized. Eighty 
million coupons (in other words 55 percent of the total) have 
been turned into shares. The people who waited, hoping that 
better enterprises would be put onto the market later, have not 
necessarily miscalculated, but they are then likely to run out 
of time: The coupons lose their value as of 1 July 1994 (the 
date has already been postponed by six months and there will be 
no new postponement). On that date, 70 percent of industrial 
property will have been transferred to the private sector. We 
will have become a bourgeois country! 
  [Gherardi] Do the Russians prefer to buy the enterprise 
which employs them? 
  [Vasilyev] Not necessarily. Just 15 to 20 percent of the 
coupons have been used in that way. By the way, that gives an 
idea of how much confidence the employees have in their 
enterprise! The biggest share (27 percent) has been invested in 
joint investment funds: 640 of these funds were created in a 
few months, and the largest one received 3 million coupons. And 
10 percent of people decided to invest in enterprises other than 
their own. 
  [Gherardi] Has privatization changed some aspect of 
corporate management? 
  [Vasilyev] Privatization has not radically changed the 
situation on the ground. The positive point is that there are 
now identified owners. Of course, the structure of the capital 
is not very efficient: In three-fourths of cases (out of 8,300 
enterprises sold by the end of December 1993), it is the 
enterprise's employees who have bought 51 percent of the 
capital. But in this privatization formula, 29 percent of the 
remaining capital must be auctioned (in exchange for coupons). 
It is true that the power has largely remained with the 
existing shareholders, but the freedom to sell shares will lead 
to reorganizations. There are already quarrels between the 
directors and outside investors to buy their shares back from 
the workers. They are approached even on the shop floor! 
  [Gherardi] They will not have been "bourgeois" for very 
long... 
  [Vasilyev] Not all are prepared to sell! There will be many 
small investors in Russia for a long time. That is not 
necessarily a bad thing. That creates a class of small owners 
who form the strongest basis for democracy. I will go even 
further: Hitherto there had been no social support for a policy 
of combating inflation; this new class will very quickly see the 
importance of financial stabilization and will give its support. 
In this sense, stabilization and privatization go together. 
  [Gherardi] But what future can enterprises "privatized" in 
this way have without fresh capital or new men? 
  [Vasilyev] The problem of recapitalization will very soon be 
raised. Nothing prevents enterprises from issuing new shares. 
Half of those which have been privatized have done so or are 
preparing to do so. Of course, that creates great competition 
to secure capital: The enterprises will be forced to open up 
their capital structure and often to give up control. But this 
will be a natural process, without any intervention by 
bureaucracy. They have assets they can sell. They will also 
try to establish alliances with foreign or Russian partners. 
  [Gherardi] Is there a difference in productivity between the 
privatized firms and the others? 
  [Vasilyev] We cannot see it very clearly yet. All the 
enterprises must be reorganized in a radical way: Know the 
market better, organize their distribution, and improve 
production. That will take at least one or two half-year 
periods. But there are dozens of examples of very efficient 
enterprises, even on an international level. We can mention 
firms like Lubertsy, which manufactures carpets in the Moscow 
area; or Kurgan in the Urals, which produces parts for oil 
extraction equipment; or even clothing factories in St. 
Petersburg. The quality they produce is comparable with that in 
other parts of the world, but at much lower prices. 
  [Gherardi] Which enterprises still have to be privatized? 
  [Vasilyev] We have already sold very big companies, such as 
ZIL (automobiles) for instance, which now have thousands of 
foreign shareholders. Others were of a more modest size. The 
average number of employees in the privatized enterprises was 
around 1,000. At present, we are preparing for the privatization 
of Gazprom (Footnote 3) (Gas monopoly which was chaired by 
current Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin) for April. This is 
an enormous operation: 89 million shares representing 29 
percent of the capital will be offered to the public. I think 
the demand will be very high. 
  [Gherardi] What share will continue to be owned by the 
state? Will Russia be a mixed economy? 
  [Vasilyev] The mixed economy exists everywhere, it is a 
question of degree. There are natural monopolies which will 
remain in state hands, like RAOES, the Russian equivalent of EDF 
[French Electricity Company] or some enterprises in the 
military-industrial complex. But the state should be involved 
as little as possible in corporate management, it is incapable 
of running enterprises.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under "Information for Reflection" </F>
rubric: "Tax Receipts in January 1994. Announcement by Russian 
Federation State Tax Service"] 
  [Text] A total of 4.86 trillion rubles [R] in taxes and 
other obligatory payments was mobilized into the country's 
budget system in January 1994, that is, 22 percent less than in 
December of last year. Receipts by the federal budget comprised 
R2 trillion-plus and fell by almost 2 percent in this time. 
Furthermore, taxpayers remitting tax in foreign currency paid in 
around $32 million. 
  A reduction in the volume of tax collections for the month 
was noted practically everywhere with the exception of Leningrad 
and Yaroslavl Oblasts. The most considerable decrease in 
receipts occurred in Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug -- by 
two-thirds, Kabardino-Balkar Republic and Kemerovo Oblast -- by 
one-half, and in another 17 regions -- by one-third. 
  The reduction in tax receipts was acounted for primarily by 
the profits tax, which comprised just over R1.8 trillion in 
January and fell by almost one-third compared with December. 
  Side by side with enterprises' difficult financial position, 
the changes in taxation legislation introduced at the beginning 
of the year, connected with giving the taxpayer additional 
benefits and exempting small enterprises from making advance 
payments during the quarter, has also affected the reduced scale 
of collection of this tax. 
  A total of R1.6 trillion in value-added tax [VAT] was 
collected in January, which approximately corresponds to the 
level of December last year, while R216 billion -- or one-third 
less -- were collected in excise duties, mainly because of 
reduced receipts from gas and alcoholic drinks. Furthermore, 
one-fourth of VAT and excise receipts was collected ahead of 
time in December 1993, by way of additional advance payment. 
  Three-fourths of the volume of all profits tax receipts in 
January were accounted for by current payments, and 59 percent 
by VAT. Receipts from profits tax were R1.4 trillion in the 
country as a whole and fell by 29 percent compared with 
December, with VAT receipts registering R958 billion and a 
3-percent fall respectively. 
  Compared with December, the collection of current VAT 
payments fell in 60 regions. The greatest laggardness from 
average Russian rates occurred in the Republic of Tuva [Tyva] -- 
by 74 percent, Khakasiya, Omsk and Magadan Oblasts, and 
Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug -- by 62-67 percent. 
  Among other basic taxes it is necessary to note the 
significant (34 percent) reduction in volumes of income tax from 
physical entities. Receipts from the aforesaid tax were only 
R620 billion as compared with R942 billion in December 1993. As 
practice shows, every year January income tax receipts are as a 
rule lower than the previous month's. This is due to the fact 
that enterprises and organizations generally pay their workers 
bonuses in December on the basis of the year's work results, and 
an additional influx of receipts from the aforesaid tax is 
ensured during this month because of this. 
  In January, the proportion of deductions into the federal 
budget went up significantly compared with the previous month, 
constituting 42 percent against December's 33 percent; on VAT 
the figures are 68 percent and 60 percent, and on profits 
(income) tax -- 41 and 29 percent. 
  During the month the problem of arrears in the payment of 
taxes into the budget by enterprises and organizations 
deteriorated still further. In this month alone this debt 
increased by R1.4 trillion, or by a factor of 1.5. As of 1 
February 1994 the volume of arrears on payments into the budget 
which accumulated during the whole of 1993 reached almost R4.5 
trillion and proved to be equal to the sum of taxes paid in in 
January of this year. 
  The extent of budgetary arrears for VAT has reached almost 
R2 
trillion, which is 1.5 times more than a month ago. The sum of 
VAT arrears exceeded the volume of January's payments of this 
tax by 17 percent. Total arrears on profits tax remained at 
practically the same level, comprising R1.3 trillion. 
  It must be noted that the federal budget accounts for 
two-thirds of the arrears of payments into the budget. The 
volume of federal budget arrears in Khanty-Mansiysk and 
Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrugs has reached R1.2 trillion, or 
42 percent of its size for the whole of the Russian Federation. 
In Orenburg Oblast the debt on payments into the federal budget 
is R100 billion, (84 percent of the total volume of arrears), 
Perm Oblast -- R98 billion (82 percent), Irkutsk Oblast -- R97 
billion (76 percent), Tomsk Oblast -- R78 billion (79 percent), 
and Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast -- R62 billion (85 percent). 
  According to the calculations of the State Tax Service, 
keeping the volume of arrears at least at the level that 
prevailed at the beginning of the year would enable us to ensure 
that tax payments can be levied in January on approximately the 
scale that was reached in December of last year.

  [Text] The Russian Federation defense minister has voiced 
the hope that the ministry's budget for 1994 will nonetheless be 
increased. The defense minister noted that the proposed total 
defense budget (37 trillion rubles) is being insisted on solely 
by the Finance Ministry. In his opinion, it would meet only 
46-47 percent of the Armed Forces' requirements.

  [Text] If all the Defense Ministry's funding requests are 
met, "it would virtually be necessary to stop economic relations 
in the country, switch the state to labor camps, and carry out 
the tasks formulated by the Defense Ministry." This was stated 
by Andrey Vavilov, Russian Federation deputy finance minister. 
  Whereas in 1992-1993 military spending accounted for around 
5 
percent of GDP, this year it will represent 5.03 percent, A. 
Vavilov said. Pointing to the need to cut defense spending in 
the light of Russia's foreign policy commitments, the deputy 
minister admitted that circumstances do not permit this process 
to begin. According to A. Vavilov, the Russian troop withdrawal 
from distant and nearby foreign countries in particular and 
provision for these servicemen will require very considerable 
expenditure.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Khokhlov "Military Review": "Pavel Makes Iron </F>
Curtains for Window Opened by Peter"] 
  [Text] Army General Grachev, Russian defense minister, 
spent the end of last week visiting Kaliningrad. Although he 
himself described this as a scheduled trip, the visit to the 
Russian enclave in the West was in many respects unexpected. 
Grachev was expected in St. Petersburg. Informed sources 
believe that the military minister's plans were changed by the 
urgent need to decide the Baltic Fleet's future -- whether it is 
to exist or not. 
  The Defense Ministry is disastrously short of money. Whereas 
at the end of 1992 the state's debts to the military totaled 5 
percent of the defense budget, at the end of 1993 the army and 
navy were owed 25 percent of their finances. In January 1994 
the Defense Ministry was given just 63 percent of the money it 
requires. There is only enough money to pay wages. The Defense 
Ministry cannot pay the military-industrial complex for hardware 
and weapons. Some 64 percent of all Russia's enterprises work 
for the defense industry and are paid by the Defense Ministry -- 
over half the country's plants, millions of workers. In 1993 
only half of the Defense Ministry's 2.2 trillion-ruble arrears 
to the military-industrial complex were paid off. The 
military-industrial complex is "falling apart." 
  The results of the "battle" over the military budget in 1994 
are unpredictable. But it is obvious even now that the Defense 
Ministry will not receive all the money it requires. Therefore 
the question of cutting back a number of military structures is 
an acute one. The Baltic Fleet has come under attack. Two 
views have clashed in the Defense Ministry. First: That the 
fleet not be destroyed. Second: That, on the basis of the 
Baltic Fleet and the Leningrad Naval Base, a "diviziya" of 
warships be created which would come under general military 
command [obshchevoyskovoye komandovaniye]. 
  Both ideas are backed by high-ranking people, and there are 
reports that a real battle has flared up. Pavel Grachev took a 
group of military and naval top brass with him to investigate 
the situation on the spot. 
<H3>  Will We Be Posing a Threat From Here? No -- Defending 
Ourselves </H3>
  In Kaliningrad the defense minister listened to the command 
of the Baltic Fleet and visited a number of military 
installations, troop units, and ships, many of which were put on 
alert during his work in the oblast and put to sea or took to 
the field. 
  Summing up the results of the trip, Pavel Grachev gave a 
cautious response to the direct question of whether the Baltic 
Fleet is to exist or not: "The Baltic Fleet will evidently 
remain as it was." Clearly, a definitive decision will be made 
once the results of the work of the numerous representatives of 
the Defense Ministry central apparatus and the commanders in 
chief of the branches of the Armed Forces who visited 
Kaliningrad Oblast with the defense minister have been 
summarized. However, Grachev assured the men of the Baltic 
Fleet that he personally is in favor of keeping a fleet in the 
Baltic. 
  The minister said that the main purpose of the visit was to 
study the decision to create a Kaliningrad Oblast Special 
Defense Area [KOOR]. This territorial operational formation is 
to comprise large groupings of ground forces, military aviation, 
air defense forces, and part of the forces of the Baltic Fleet. 
The Kaliningrad Special Defense Area will interact with the 
border troops and, possibly, with units of the Russian Ministry 
of Internal Affairs [MVD] internal troops, which Pavel Grachev 
intends to discuss with [MVD Minister] Viktor Yerin in Moscow in 
the near future. 
  The plan is to place the Kaliningrad Special Defense Area 
under the jurisdiction of the defense minster and the General 
Staff. The grouping will be under the command of a single 
commanding officer. If he is a naval commander, his deputies 
will be general military personnel. And vice versa. The 
special defense area's main tasks are to defend the littoral and 
the airspace. 
  All categories of support for the Kaliningrad Special 
Defense 
Area will be organized at central level. That is difficult right 
now owing to the isolated position of Russia's most westerly 
oblast. Following his talks with the Kaliningrad Oblast 
Administration Pavel Grachev intends to confront the Russian 
authorities with the question of creating a St. 
Petersburg-Baltiysk "sea run". It is envisaged that a 
transshipment base will be set up in Leningrad Oblast from which 
military freight and combat hardware will be shipped to the 
Kaliningrad Special Defense Area by amphibious warfare ships or 
seagoing ferries. That is a costly business, but transit 
through Lithuania is now several times more costly. Like cable 
communications lines too. The laying of underwater lines is now 
being completed, and it is also planned to provide the 
Kaliningrad Special Defense Area with additional space 
communications systems. 
<H5>  Minister Gunning for Every Penny </H5>
  During his final news conference in the Baltiysk Garrison 
Officers' Club the defense minister devoted half an hour instead 
of the promised 10 minutes to journalists and film crews. 
Warming to his theme, Pavel Grachev spoke about... 
  ...his daily routine: "I spend half my working time thinking 
about where to get money for the army and navy -- I search it 
out, or I `extort' it." 
  ...Armed Forces manning: "The fall draft went OK. I hope 
the spring draft will also provide us with enlisted men and 
seamen. I think that by the end of 1994 we will be able to man 
the main Armed Forces categories some 85-90 percent. And 
secondary categories 60-65 percent. That is quite acceptable 
given the realities we face. Throughout the world, 20-30 
percent of citizens are exempt from the draft. Legislators in 
our country have 'gone over the toip': 70 percent of citizens 
are exempt from service, while 30-40 percent of those who are 
drafted are sick." 
  ...contract service: "There are already 120,000 contract 
personnel. The president has authorized another 150,000 to be 
recruited in 1994." 
  ...the "breakup" of the Air Defense Forces: "There have been 
reports in the press that the Air Defense Forces are being 
halved. Not at all. We are to some extent 'contracting' the 
troops, removing obsolete systems. All the same, we cannot 
cover all the targets in the country, we will select the most 
important. Special attention now is to be focused on electronic 
reconnaissance systems and reinforcing the Air Defense Forces' 
fighter aviation. There will be good intelligence, making it 
possible to enlist the Air Force and antimissile defense forces 
and systems to defend the airspace."

  [Text] The Secretary of the Northern Fleet's Military

exercises did in fact aim primarily to insure the coordination 
of moves in the preparation of a multinational naval task force 
for the imposition of a naval blockade at "hot spots" around the 
world. 
  Polozkov was interviewed by Interfax following a REUTERS 
report on the exercises. REUTERS quoted the Chief of the 
Russian Navy's Press Center, Aleksandr Veledeyev, as doubting 
whether the exercises aimed to insure coordinated performance by 
the Russian and Western navies. 
  Norwegian, U.S., British, German, and Russian warships are 
to 
take part in the Pomor-94 exercises in the Sea of Norway on 
March 21. 
  The First Deputy Commander of the Russian Navy, Admiral Igor 
Kasatonov, has told Interfax the Pomor-94 exercises are part of 
a series of moves to enhance coordination between the Russian 
and NATO fleets. Admiral Kasatonov will be monitoring the 
exercises on behalf of Russia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Women Block Flights"] </F>
  [Text] Something extraordinary has occurred in the Air 
Defense Troops' air regiment on the island of Sakhalin. Wives 
of officers and ensigns went onto the runway and started 
blocking flights. The cause of this was a chronic lack of money 
-- the 1egiment's servicemen have not been paid since January. 
  Colonel Semen Romanenko, deputy chief of the Air Defense 
Troops Financial and Economic Directorate, told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that money has today been transferred to the Far 
Eastern servicemen for a specific purpose. In his opinion, 
however, the question of money to pay servicemen and to finance 
the Air Defense Troops has not been resolved as a whole. 
Special concern is aroused by the debt of 18 billion rubles [R] 
in respect of Moscow Regional Power Administration accounts. 
This organization is warning of the possible disconnection of 
the Central Command Post and other important installations which 
ensure Russia's national security. 
  Col. Romanenko blames the disastrous situation with regard 
to 
funding the Air Defense Troops' Far Eastern units on a shortfall 
of R2 billion compared with the planned provision. The 
ITAR-TASS correspondent managed to ascertain from the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Defense that not only the families of 
Sakhalin servicemen are suffering from a lack of money. In 
February one-fourth of Russia's servicemen did not receive their 
pay, and there will be still more in March.

  [Text] Chapayevsk chemical weapons destruction factory is 
still a very secret enterprise with restricted access, though it 
has not worked a single day in five years since the moment it 
was built. It was constructed using unique Russian technology, 
and is the only one of its kind, not only in Russia, but, 
experts concede, in the whole world, in terms of the level of 
technological safety and of the efficiency of rendering the 
chemical charges harmless, the so-called discharge process 
[rassnaryazheniye]. The military unit on whose books this 
factory is today is forced to find substantial resources for the 
maintenance of the mothballed works, though a decision was made 
back in 1989 to set up a training center here that would use 
neutral media. 
  Administration heads of seven Russian regions where all 
chemical weapons of the former USSR are now stored recently 
visited the installation: Everybody seems to have woken up to 
the fact that it is more dangerous to store than to destroy 
them. Therefore, technologies for chemical disarmament should 
be moved closer to places of storage: A state program of 
financing, and, more importantly, an open discussion in the mass 
media over location of chemical disarmament enterprises are 
needed to achieve this. Otherwise, things will happen as they 
did in Chapayevsk -- the installation was built in secret, with 
immense resources, but it is not working.

  [Text] Russia plans to set up new launch pads and silos for 
new generation missiles in the Far Eastern town of Svobodny 
(Amur region) between 1996 and 2000, a spokesman for the 
country's military space forces (MSF) told Interfax. 
  MSF which is responsible for space communications and 
satellite intelligence gathering plans a rebuilding of the first 
of the 60 silos left after the destruction of SS-11 ICBMs for 
launches of a new generation booster developed on the basis of 
an SS-19 missile by 1996. As many as five such silos will be 
rebuilt, said the spokesman. 
  Russia's SS-19 two-stage missiles with a payload of 105.6 
tons each are to be destroyed by the year 2003 as envisaged by 
the START-2 agreement between Moscow and Washington. 
  It is also known that MSF plans an environmentally safe 
general purpose launch pad for a new generation heavy duty 
Angara-24 missile. 
  An MSF official said that since the new booster "can be 
transformed depending on a payload and altitude", the new launch 
pad would operate on the principle of "a changeable circus 
arena". 
  The new booster is to undergo trial tests during 1998-1999 
before being fired into outer space a year or two later.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Mar -- An ITAR-TASS correspondent was 
informed at the Central Election Committee that according to 
preliminary results elections to bodies of representative power 
that were held on Sunday are considered valid in 13 of the 17 
parts of the Russian Federation. 
  Viktor Klimov, head of the organization and methods 
department, explained that over two-thirds of the deputy corps 
of the legislative assemblies -- or oblast dumas as the new 
bodies of representative power in the regions are mostly called 
-- had been elected in these regions. That is just the number 
of deputies necessary for the body to be considered capable, for 
it to convene and start working. The rest of its members in the 
regions will be elected in repeated elections, the dates for 
which will be set locally. Viktor Klimov said "the elections 
had given 100 per cent results" only in three parts of the 
federation -- the Aginsk, Buryat, and Komi-Permyak autonomous 
okrugs. In each of the three parts, deputies had been elected 
from all 15 okrugs and their representative bodies were at full 
strength. 
  In three parts of the federation the elections have been 
deemed invalid. In St.Petersburg they have been prolonged to 
today by the decision of the mayor.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Zolotaryova and Natalia </F>
Cherepanova] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg March 21 TASS -- St. Petersburg's 
public prosecutor filed a protest against city mayor Anatoliy 
Sobchak's decision to extend the voting in the city council 
elections for another 24 hours. 
  The duration of the voting is determined by Article 33 of 
the 
regulations on elections to the legislative bodies of power in 
regions, territories, cities with federal status, autonomous 
regions and autonomous territories approved by a presidential 
decree of October 27, 1993. The mayor has no right to change 
the duration of voting, a statement issued by the public 
prosecutor said. 
  Ten out of 16 registered electoral associations adopted a 
joint declaration on Monday denouncing Sobchak's decision as a 
"wrong move" and suggesting holding new elections on April 17 
with the same list of candidates. A Russian central Electoral 
Commission official said earlier today that Sobchak's decision 
is a "case which requires juridical examination." 
  Yuriy Orlov, head of the legal department of the Central 
Electoral Commission, said that there is no direct ban on such 
extension in the standing legislation. But this is the first 
such case and it "creates a precedent" which must be studied by 
the Central Electoral Commission. 
  Under the Russian Constitution, St. Petersburg is a subject 
of the federation that has the right to establish its own voting 
procedures and rules which, however, should not run counter to 
the regulations approved by the president, Orlov explained. 
  He said that his department is now working out a draft law 
on 
basic franchise guarantees in the Russian Federation. It will 
include proposals made by regional electoral commissions, 
political parties and associations aimed at improving the 
electoral law. In it "we will try to provide for such cases and 
other unexpected situations which may arise during the election 
campaign," Orlov said.

  [Text] Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin and Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin have held a meeting in Sochi with 
Nikolay Yegorov, the head of administration of Krasnodar Kray, 
and Sochi Mayor Nikolay Karpov. It was decided to set up a 
working group to draw up a treaty between the federal agencies 
of state power and the bodies running the kray concerning 
demarcation of functions in line with the Constitution of the 
Russian Federation and the Federation Treaty, taking account of 
the particular features of Krasnodar Kray. The Russian 
Federation's Security Council has been instructed to prepare a 
package of questions on Krasnodar Kray for consideration at one 
of its upcoming sessions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mayor of Moscow Yuriy Luzhkov by Valeriy </F>
Simonov: "Spring and the Muscovites"] 
  [Text] Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov gives the impression of a 
man who has had a great weight lifted from his shoulders. This 
is understandable: Some 24 hours before our conversation the 
mayor had had a beautiful daughter, weighing in at 4,400 grams. 
So even Moscow Spartak's crushing defeat in Barcelona (Luzhkov 
did not watch the match, of course) did not have a significant 
effect on his mood, as is evident from the photograph [photo 
shows him grinning broadly]. Our conversation, alas, focused on 
matters far more prosaic. 
  [Simonov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, Muscovites are greeting spring 
not only with joy, but with a degree of apprehension: They all 
remember May Day last year, the battle in Leninskiy Prospekt, 
and the Moscow militia's sense of total impotence. Have lessons 
been learned from this? 
  [Luzhkov] It is primarily those who organized the riots in 
Moscow who should learn the lessons. The lesson is simple: 
Extremism no longer works, you will not achieve any objectives 
using it. I hope that after the spring clashes last year and 
after the October tragedy, the majority of political movements 
and structures intend act entirely in accordance with the law, 
because no one benefits from blood on the streets. If you want 
power, act, but by parliamentary means. Gain people's favor, 
win the elections, and form organs of power. But society will 
not allow you to implement your slogans through attacks, through 
threats, and through bloodshed. 
  Of course, rallies and marches are unavoidable in our 
turbulent times -- but they can and must be carried out in the 
capital strictly in accordance wuith the rules laid down by city 
hall and the government. We are not against people expressing 
their will normally -- peacefully! I would point out, 
incidentally, that disputes arose when city hall lifted its ban 
on demonstrations following the court ruling. But the leaders 
of the masses must show the same respect for the law. 
  [Simonov] But these are all political conclusions. What 
about practical ones? 
  [Luzhkov] What I will say is that we are making very serious 
preparations for possible trouble. The police are equipped. 
The law-enforcement organs have been instructed to stop any 
activity that poses a threat to Muscovites' safety and peace. 
  As for last year's confusion... There was confusion. We 
were unprepared for the fact that the nature of the 
demonstrations changed completely. Basically, what we faced on 
1 May was organized thuggery. We are prepared this time. 
  [Simonov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, what is the situation on the 
other front -- the food front? Some analysts are predicting 
empty shelves by the spring, linking this to the introduction of 
the new customs duties. 
  [Luzhkov] There will be no empty shelves -- I can assure you 
of that. We will not allow any breakdown in food supply, it 
will remain stable. 
  As for prices, I do not understand and do not accept the 
government's decision on new duties on foodstuffs. We have 
already been through that: We imposed excessive duties on 
imported cars -- and prices of "Zhiguli," "Moskvich," and other 
cars immediately soared. The same would happen to food. The 
struggle here at the moment is not for increased production 
volumes, not for economic work by enterprises -- what they are 
trying to do is ensure production viability solely by increasing 
prices. But this is a dead-end street! This measure will help 
for a -- short -- while, and then it falls apart. Look: There 
is a surplus of cars on the market at the moment. The plants, 
having jacked up their prices, are failing to resolve their 
problems because they are unable to sell their cars. People 
cannot buy cars at that price, cannot invest their money. This 
is a double damper on an already barely warm economy. 
  But the food situation is even more serious. This decision 
hits the big cities first and foremost, and northern areas -- 
those that do not have their own agricultural base. Take 
Moscow. A large proportion of our food is imported. Some 50 
percent of our traditional meat and dairy products are actually 
produced abroad. You do not have to consult a fortune-teller to 
be able to predict that home agricultural producers are going to 
raise their prices now -- and again there is no competition. 
Will this breathe life into our agriculture? Obviously it will 
not, since it is the same old production forces and production 
relations in the countryside. On the other hand, the 
purchasesing power of the cities, particularly big cities, is 
falling. For example, we can already see how much less 
Muscovites are eating. 
  [Simonov] And how much is it? 
  [Luzhkov] Well, nearly 50 percent less vegetables, for 
instance. At this time of year daily sales in Moscow are 
traditionally more than 5,000 tonnes. Now it is 3,000-3,200. 
Yet people's personal stocks of potatoes and carrots are now 
exhausted. 
  The meat situation is as follows: Not long ago 4,000-4,300 
tonnes would go in a day; it is half that amount today. On the 
other hand, bread consumption has increased considerably. 
  Therefore, I regard the increase in customs duties on 
imported food as an unfair, unfriendly step against Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, Yekaterinburg (Editorial note: As we know, the 
three mayors of the aforementioned cities put together an appeal 
to the Russian president condemning the government's step), and 
the North. I can see this policy having most appalling 
consequences for Muscovites. 
  Let us take a closer look at this decree: What I wonder is 
who is it working for if it envisages that there will be no duty 
on food coming into Russia from the particularly underdeveloped 
countries, the underdeveloped countries will get duty 
reductions, while the industrial states will get the full works. 
Where do Russia's interests come into it? Is the idea to make 
Russians' food worse and more dangerous? It is crass 
politicking and stupidity again! So we are supposed to give up 
guaranteed high-quality food and support underdeveloped 
countries' economies instead. Very Soviet. 
  [Simonov] It is a very banal question, but there is no 
getting away from it. I am talking about Moscow's highways. It 
appeared they could not get any worse, then the snow melted, 
revealing an absolute nightmare. 
  [Luzhkov] Yes indeed, in the winter I banned highway repair, 
because we were sinking money in mud. The repairs will begin in 
April, covering 20 million square meters. It could be more, the 
potential is there, but the money is not, and we have to face 
this fact. The Ring Road is a very difficult task, but we will 
deal with it this year. It has a bad reputation and has become 
extremely dangerous. There will be lighting and a median strip 
along the entire length of it. 
  [Simonov] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, what was the outcome (did it 
have an outcome?) of your dispute with Anatoliy Chubays over 
privatization methods? 
  [Luzhkov] The president instructed Chernomyrdin to sort out 
our differences. They are certainly fundamental. It is not me 
getting on my high horse and it is not some great-power policy 
on Moscow's part. I believe Chubays is not behaving properly in 
carrying out the president's direct instructions to enable 
privatization to take place in Moscow on our terms. It all 
boils down again to the methods of the State Committee for the 
Management of State Property. No account at all is taken of 
Moscow's mighty infrastructure, banking and exchange network, 
and technological caliber, and people's skills. I have said it 
before and I say it again: Without taking these facts into 
account Moscow will be sold short. I don't want to let this 
happen, I don't want my name to be linked to the major mistakes 
Chubays and his department are making on matters of 
privatization. These mistakes will have repercussions in the 
state. 
  [Simonov] What do you think of the fact that you are 
figuring more and more prominently in the political ratings. 
You are even being tipped as president... 
  [Luzhkoiv] I have absolutely no view concerning this talk 
and these articles. I follow Pushkin: "indifferent both to 
praise and slander." I love my work, but I know what I am 
capable of, and I know my limitations as well. My own sober 
assessment is that I do not think a mayor responsible for the 
Moscow economy can be elevated to such heights. 
  Anyway, I do not much like the talk about presidential 
elections. They are still two and one-half years away. What is 
the point of all the fuss about them today? All it does is 
undermine the executive power's authority in the state. If 
people are talking up the elections, apparently, it means that 
everything is unstable and temporary and the president's 
decisions and opinion need not be heeded. 
  But there is an interesting, instructive element in the 
latest ratings. The "managers," if you can call them that, are 
emerging in the leading roles. They are overtaking the pure 
politicians. This is a sign, if you like: Society increasingly 
needs people who know how to get things done, rather than people 
who talk a load of nonsense. This is a very important change. 
A person must be assessed in terms of what he has done, rather 
than what he has said, in terms of what he can do, rather than 
what he wants to do. 
  Look how leaders are trained in Japan. There a manager is 
obliged to climb the ladder. But a state is not some kind of 
office, it is a very intricate system. And that our Russia 
certainly is.

<F P=106> [Report from roundup of ITAR-TASS reports: "Steppe Code </F>
Instead of Constitution?"] 
  [Text] The Kalmykia parliament has decided to replace the 
constitution with a new fundamental law for the republic. At 
its extraordinary session it examined normative documents for 
the adoption of the so-called Steppe Code instead of the 
constitution in operation at present. The mechanism for 
reworking the republic's legislative basis was approved by 25 
parliamentarians who have thus decided the fate of the entire 
people living on the territory of Kalmykia. 
  Less than two weeks have been assigned for a discussion of 
the Steppe Code. After it has been adopted, if it is adopted, 
the republic's supreme legislative organ will be the people's 
khural, which Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov could dissolve 
at any moment, considering that it is failing to ensure 
stability in society.

  [Text] The administration of the Maritime Territory prefers 
the use of Japanese technologies in processing radioactive 
wastes, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, governor of the Maritime Territory 
has told reporters. He said that a national installation would 
require 1Bn 270 Mn rubles, while Japan is prepared to grant 
know-how free. 
  Nazdratenko said that the Maritime Territory would be forced 
to agree to continue purchasing grain abroad. He explained the 
decision by the fact that now one ton of the national grain 
costs 270,000 rubles, but with the addition of transport costs, 
it will cost 400,000 rubles. One ton of grain imported from 
Canada costs 100,000 rubles.(end)

emergency measures to complete preparations for the spring field 
work. The local authorities have found an opportunity to 
allocate fuels and lubricants and spare parts for agricultural 
machinery to sovkhozes and associations of peasant farms without 
payment up front. Credits have been offered to farms for the 
purchase of seeds and fertilizers which are in short supply.

organizations issued a statement Monday [21 March] protesting 
the initialed agreement between Latvia and Russia on the Skrunda 
radar station and the status of retired Russian servicemen in 
the Baltic country. 
  The Latvian Government in fact legalized the Russian 
occupation by initialing the agreement, according to the 
statement. 
  The organizations urge the Saeima (parliament) to decline 
the 
agreement's ratification because the document is evidently 
hostile to the intersts of the Latvian nation. It may also 
provoke unpredictable consequences in the future. 
  The group also calls on President Guntis Ulmanis not to sign 
the document. 
  The statement is signed by the Latvian National Independence 
Movement's Swedish department, the Latvian National Fund, the 
Swedish-Latvians Central Council and the Swedish Daugavas Vanagi 
organization.

2, interstate agreement, Ilgonis Upmalis, head of the Latvian

  The Russian Armed Forces owe Latvia at least 25,587 lats for 
608 flights in 1993 and 69 flights this year. Russia also has 
not paid for the use of airspace in those flights. 
  Russian Air Force command representative Anatoly Rudena is

  [Text] Riga, Mar 21, BNS -- A special group is already 
formed to prevent possible diversions against Russian army's 
strategic object -- Skrunda radar station, Latvian attorney 
general, Janis Skrastins, told Saturday [19 March] in his 
interview to Latvian radio. 
  A special sapper unit will also be stationed for a time in 
Kuldiga to immediately liquidate explosive devices if found any 
near Skrunda radar station. 
  The above mentioned actions were taken due to the blowing up 
of pole for high-tension power line in Feb. 28 near Skrunda 
radar and the explosive device found March 15 at a pole for 
electricity wires, situated 1 kilometer away from Skrunda radar 
station's pass post. 
  Charges are brought against wrongdoers, and Latvian 
Prosecutors Office Board for Special Issues and Kuldiga district 
Prosecutors Office investigate both cases. Presently it is not 
clear if both the incidents are connected. 
  During the examination of clock mechanism that was connected 
to the explosive device found March 15, experts stated that the 
organizators of the explosion were non-professionals. The 
experts claim the device was made of 12 kilograms of tolite, 
electric detonator, wires, clock mechanism and power supplying 
battery. If it had exploded, not only near located houses but 
also Skrunda radar station would have suffered damages. 
  In return, it is stated that nearly half a kilogram of 
tolite 
caused the explosion in February 28.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 21, BNS -- The second round of free trade 
talks between Latvia and the European Union [EU] takes place 
March 21-22 in Brussels, the Latvian Foreign Ministry reports. 
  On Monday, the parties are scheduled to look at the text of 
a 
regulation providing to lift import tariffs of 
Latvian-production goods immediately after the free trade pact 
is ratified. 
  On Tuesday, panels will discuss customs quotas for various 
kinds of industrial and farm produce. 
  Latvia must lift import duties of EU goods within four years 
after the free trade agreement is ratified, according to an 
agreement reached during the first round of bilateral talks in 
February. The measure is aimed at protecting the Latvian 
economy from too swift an influx of EU goods. Currently, it is 
difficult to fix concrete quotas for textile and farm products 
because the Latvian parliament has not ended discussions on the 
issue yet. 
  EU plans to grant Latvia the status of its associated member 
right after the signature of the free trade accord. As 
reported, the Baltic-EU free trade talks are unlikely to be 
hampered by any major obstacles. 
  The Baltic states, however, may face difficulties when 
trying 
to convert this initial agreement into a Euro agreement in one 
or two years. The Euro agreement grants its signatories the 
status of full fledged members in EU. 
  EU experts prognosticate that the union will enroll EFTA 
[European Free Trade Association] states (except Switzerland and 
Iceland) by 1995. 
  The Visegrad group (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and 
Hungary) and, probably, the Baltic states, could join EU by 1995. 
  Latvia's aspirations to enter into EU are endorsed by 
Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Great Britain. 
The Latvian delegation to the talks is headed by Olgerts 
Pavlovskis, the country's minister for foreign trade and EU 
affairs. The group includes officials from several related 
ministries. 
  The third round of free trade talks is scheduled for April 8 
in Riga. The free trade agreement between Latvia and EU could 
be ready in May, experts said.

<F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Saeima Committee Supports </F>
Foreign Policy Doctrine"] 
  [Text] Riga, 8 Mar -- The Saeima [parliament] Committee for 
Foreign Policy has expressed its support for Latvian foreign 
policy, as outlined by the government, as well as its agreement 
to debate the policy doctrine during a plenary session of 
parliament. It is possible that discussions on this proposal 
will begin almost immediately. 
  As Aleksandrs Kirsteins, head of the Committee for Foreign 
Policy, told journalists after the committee's meeting, the 
foreign policy doctrine is based on Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs' speech at the international conference "Latvian 
Security at the Turn of the Century." It has been submitted to 
the Saeima in a somewhat different form. V. Birkavs will 
present the doctrine at the plenary session, before formal 
debate begins. At present, Latvia does not have a foreign 
policy doctrine, per se, approved by parliament. 
  The main points of this doctrine are: Latvia's orientation 
towards the West, membership and cooperation with international 
institutions -- NATO, the European Union [EU], the Western 
European Union, CSCE, the Balladur plan -- as well as 
concluding a free-trade agreement with the EU that will permit 
Latvia to obtain EU associate member status. Latvia's relations 
with Russia, according to the foreign policy doctrine, should be 
equable in economic as well as political terms, though not at 
any price, especially not for the price of losing Latvia's 
general orientation, emphasized A. Kirsteins. 
  A. Kirsteins also said that Latvia has to accept, in the 
immediate future, the law on citizenship, and the document 
regulating the status of foreigners and stateless people in 
Latvia. The suggestion of Russian President Boris Yeltsin [not 
further specified] could be interpreted as a good idea, A. 
Kirsteins stated.

Spilve airport and move to a permanent base, and the Latvian 
Government should seek to provide at least the minimal material 
means to enable the Air Force to accomplish its tasks, Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs stated today. The prime minister's 
remarks came after his visit to the present location of the 
Latvian Air and Antiaircraft Forces at the dilapidated Spilve 
airport. The permanent base, as envisaged when the Air Force 
was created, will be at Lielvarde. 
  Presently, the situation in the Air Force is critical 
because, of their two L-410 airplanes, one is undergoing repair 
while the other, due to a lack of money, is still waiting its 
turn to be repaired. In addition, out of six helicopters, only 
one is reported to be in active service. 
  As was established in the concept of airspace control 
recently accepted by the National Security Council, Latvia's 
airspace is to be controlled by the Civil Service with the 
cooperation of military specialists. Air Force Commander Karlis 
Kins explained to V. Birkavs that it would be essential to 
create one or two posts for military specialists in the Civil 
Airspace Control Services in Riga and Liepaja. However, 
aircraft which pass through our airspace should not only be 
tracked by radar, but also, in cases of an emergency, 
manipulated [manipulacijas]. To accomplish this, fighter planes 
are needed. The small Czech-manufactured L-39 fighter would be 
optimal in technical as well as financial terms. V. Birkavs said 
that the government has agreed to purchase two Mi-8 helicopters, 
but at the present time there is no money available. 
  K. Kins expressed his anxiety over the fact that factors of 
state security have not been taken into account in the 
telecommunication system created by "Lattelecom." While working 
on the project, consultations with military specialists were not 
carried out. V. Birkavs agreed that these factors should be 
included in the project.

<F P=106> [Article by Modris Posse: "LTF Thinks That the Opinion of </F>
the People Should Be Taken Into Account"] 
  [Text] Riga, 9 Mar -- The Latvian Popular Front [LTF] has 
decided to organize a meeting on 12 March on Doma Square with 
the aim of expressing their opinion on the continued operation 
of the Skrunda radar station and the troop withdrawal agreement 
reached with Russia. Most probably, participants in the meeting 
will be able to express their opinion by signing a petition 
which will be presented to the government and the Saeima 
[parliament]. 
  As LTF Chairman Uldis Augstkalns stated at a press 
conference, the government does not take into account the 
opinion of either different political parties or social 
organizations. Such policies, stressed Augstkalns, result in 
violations of the basic condition of democracy -- respect for 
the interests of citizens. 
  Taking into consideration the fact that the next round of 
interstate negotiations will begin on 14 March, we do not want 
the meeting to be interpreted as a provocation, but still, the 
opinion of the people should be respected, said Talavs Jundzis, 
LTF deputy chief and head of the Baltic Center for Strategic 
Research. 
  He is of the view that concluding the compromise agreement 
with Russia can result in Latvia's losing its independence or 
even a new occupation. The real path to Latvian security does 
not lead to neutrality, nor does it aim toward the East or the 
West; it lies in a steady position on all primary political 
goals, summarized T. Jundzis.

<F P=106> [UKRINFORM report on "Statement by the Ukrainian </F>
Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press Service"] 
  [Text] The pre-election marathon is entering its final 
stage. Hence the obvious tension in the struggle for 
parliamentary seats among candidates for people's deputies. 
However, during the debates in the mass media and meetings with 
the electorate, some candidates are resorting to stirring up 
unhealthy passions against the Ukrainian president. 
  In particular, rumors to the effect that Leonid Kravchuk has 
a summer house in Switzerland are being spread actively and 
deliberately. The goal of these insinuations is clear: By 
"exposing," in this manner, the president, who was elected as a 
result of nationwide elections, they are trying to picture 
themselves as champions of the interests of the working people. 
  The Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press 
Service states this: This theme is not new. It already 
surfaced during difficult periods in the history of independent 
Ukraine. The Ukrainian president and the mass media were even 
earlier approached by people seeking explanations about the 
gossip on the so-called "dacha issues." 
  Both the president and the mass media have also repeatedly 
stated that Leonid Kravchuk does not have and has no intention 
of having any property outside our state. As Ukrainian 
president, he adheres to norms specified for the head of state 
by the relevant Supreme Council decision. 
  The Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of Ministers Press 
Service has been authorized to state that, also at present, such 
"revelations" regarding the Swiss dacha are nothing more than 
unseemly and provocative fabrications on the part of those who 
would like to acquire political capital by dishonest methods. 
  This becomes even more obvious if one realizes that there 
are 
very simple and effective ways to check such information. For 
this, it is necessary simply to turn to the competent Swiss 
bodies either in Ukraine (the Swiss Embassy) or abroad and, in 
accordance with Swiss laws, obtain the necessary information.

  [Text] President Kravchuk signed a decree, which was 
circulated by the media on Monday, 21 March, and which specifies 
the Kievan municipality's functions and prerogatives involved in 
maintaining the city's national capital status and aimed at 
normalizing the social and economic situation in Kiev. The 
decree specifies that, pending adoption of the law of Ukraine on 
Ukraine's capital, the metropolitan municipality takes part in 
drafting and implementation of city development projects, 
exercises proprietorial management of Kiev's enterprises, 
establishments, institutions and organizations, takes part in 
decision-making, involving placement of central bodies which are 
formed by the Verhovna Rada (Parliament), president and 
government, exercises control over and registration of the 
city's housing, drafts and implements urban construction 
projects, etc. 
  The decree instructs the Cabinet and [word indistinct] to 
allot 15 to 20 percent of hard currency earned by metropolitan 
enterprises for the metropolitan municipality's needs. The 
Cabinet is also instructed to annually set a state order for 
food and manufactured goods procurement to ensure the continuous 
flow of commodity supplies to the capital. The National Bank of 
Ukraine is ordered to issue licenses to Kievan enterprises 
allowing them to charge rent in hard currency for their 
non-dwelling buildings and public utilities rented by foreign 
clients under contract or agreement. The metropolitan custom 
house and municipal interior bodies are instructed to allot 50 
percent of proceeds, including hard currency as well as of hard 
currency which has been confiscated by them, for the capital 
city's needs.

  [Text] Donetsk March 21 TASS -- It seems that the very word 
"referendum" has begun to irritate Ukrainian authorities after 
two weeks of fruitless disputes between Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk and newly elected Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov about a referendum in the Crimea. 
  The polemics which tends to involve more and more political 
forces has distracted the Ukrainian public from yet another 
plebiscite in the Donbass coal basin scheduled for March 27. 
  Residents of the region were supposed to say whether or not 
the Russian language should be considered as a second state 
language in Ukraine and express their attitude towards Ukraine's 
administrative division and participation in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  The decision to hold the referendum was adopted by the 
regional council on February 22. However, it had taken Kiev 
authorities a month to respond by ordering the public prosecutor 
to protest the council's decision. The Russian-speaking region 
said it will convene an urgent session of the regional council 
on March 23 to discuss further steps. 
  Meanwhile, the Lugansk region of Ukraine has announced its 
decision to hold a similar poll on the state language.

<F P=106> ["Appeal of the President of the Republic of Crimea to the </F>
Citizens of the Republic, Citizens' Associations, Trade Union 
Organizations, Labor Collectives, and Members of Electoral 
Commissions"] 
  [Text] On 10 March of this year, I issued Edict No. 05/94 
"On the Conduct of a Poll of the Citizens of the Republic of 
Crimea on 27 March 1994." Its purpose was the creation of a 
legal space favorable to the implementation of a preelection 
program regarding dual citizenship, Crimea's complete economic 
independence, and the practical preparation of important acts 
necessary for the successful implementation of reforms. This 
determined the essence of the questions submitted for the poll 
of citizens of the Republic of Crimea: 
  1) Are you for the restoration of the provision of the 
Constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992 which 
determines the regulation of mutual relations between the 
Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of a TREATY and 
AGREEMENTS? (Yes/No) 
  The need for this question is associated with the fact that 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine has not made a decision up until 
now about whether the law of Ukraine "On Demarcating the Powers 
between the Organs of State Authority of Ukraine and the 
Republic of Crimea" is in effect or not. Periodically, guided 
by political considerations, the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
makes attempts to require bringing the Constitution and 
legislative acts of the Republic of Crimea immediately into 
conformity with the Constitution and legislation of Ukraine. 
This makes the conduct of progressive economic reorganizations 
in the Crimea extremely difficult and the arrangement of 
fruitful relations with foreign partners even more complicated. 
  2) Are you for the restoration of the provision of the 
Constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992 that 
proclaimed the RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CRIMEA TO 
DUAL CITIZENSHIP? (Yes/No) 
  With its decree of 24 February 1994 "On the Status of the 
Autonomous Republic of Crimea in accordance with the Existing 
Constitution and Legislation of Ukraine," the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine made an attempt to deprive the Republic of Crimea of its 
own citizenship, reducing it simply to a concept of permanent 
residence on the peninsula. Naturally, this infringes 
considerably on the rights of Crimeans and does not respond to 
the aspirations of a majority of them that are directed at 
acquiring Russian citizenship as a second citizenship, like that 
of the other republics of the former Union. Therefore, it makes 
sense to elicit the opinion of citizens of the Crimea on the 
question, whose resolution Ukraine is hindering in every way 
possible. 
  3) Are you for conceding the FORCE OF LAWS to the edicts of 
the president of the Republic of Crimea on questions that are 
temporarily not regulated by legislation of the Republic of 
Crimea? (Yes/No) 
  The lawmaking activity of today's deputy corps has been 
rather weak, an insignificant legacy was left, and many key 
legal questions remained outside the purview of the Supreme 
Soviet of Crimea. After the elections, essentially new deputies 
will come to parliament who will acquire at least some 
legislative experience after many months. But regardless of 
this, and whether the Supreme Soviet adopts the required laws in 
a timely way or not, people all the same will have to drink, 
eat, clothe themselves, sow, harvest, study, get medical 
treatment, and so forth. And so that our impoverished and 
wretched life would change, reforms would continue, production 
would be normalized, and the lag behind Russia, not to mention 
behind countries of the West, would be reduced, it is expedient 
for the period until parliament begins to work quickly and 
qualitatively to allot to the president the right to issue 
appropriate acts on the most pressing questions in the vital 
activity of the republic that are not reflected in legislation 
in force. 
  It would seem that everything is clear and understandable. 
However, contrary to common sense, the Central Electoral 
Commission on elections to the Supreme Soviet of Crimea, with 
its decree No. 21/1 of 12 March 1994, expressed a reluctance to 
take on the work, and more accurately, the honor of organizing 
and conducting a poll of the citizens of the republic that 
responds to the despair of Crimeans, which is convincingly 
indicated by the results of the presidential elections. What is 
more, in paragraph 1 of its decree, the Central Electoral 
Commission, headed by V.V. Alsufyev, proposed to the president 
of Crimea to bring the provisions of the edict into conformity 
with existing legislation, thereby assuming the functions of the 
Constitutional Court of the Republic of Crimea. This is an 
impermissible excess of the powers granted to the Central 
Electoral Commission by Article 14 of the Law "On Elections to 
the Supreme Soviet of Crimea." 
  The conduct of the poll on another day or the creation of 
special commissions for the conduct of the poll do not 
constitute insurmountable difficulties, but it will require an 
additional diversion of numerous people with multibillion costs, 
which is not very sensible under conditions of a shortage even 
for the payment of pensions and wages. Therefore, the conduct 
of the poll simultaneously with the elections of the parliament 
of Crimea and the forces of the same electoral commissions would 
respond to the greatest degree to the interests of Crimeans -- 
the expenditures will be reduced essentially to the cost of 
printing ballots and distributing them to the polls. 
  In view of the aforementioned, I appeal to all voters, 
citizens' associations, trade union organizations, and labor 
collectives that have nominated their own representatives to the 
electoral commissions: Hold meetings with the members of the 
commissions and give them instructions to support the idea of 
conducting a poll on 27 March 1994 with the forces of the 
currently operating electoral commissions. And I ask the 
members of every electoral commission to accept the decisions at 
their meetings concerning the participation of the commissions, 
regardless of the objective difficulties associated with this in 
the conduct of the poll scheduled for 27 March 1994 of citizens 
of the Republic of Crimea, about which the appropriate executive 
committees will issue notices. 
  The source of strength of a president is his unity with the 
people. Support the idea of an all-Crimean poll, and the 
achievement of our common goals, although not much, will be 
closer.

  [Text] The decree on polling citizens issued by the 
Crimean president on 10 March prompted yesterday's fourth 
session of the Central Electoral Committee of the Crimea. In 
the course of the preceding sessions held jointly with 
presidential representatives, the committee drafted a compromise 
version of the decree on holding the poll. The Central 
Electoral Committee resolved to consider it possible to grant 
organizational support to President Meshkov in holding the poll 
in such a way as not to contradict laws or endanger the 
elections.

"Crimea"] 
  [Text] The Crimean Tatars think that the holding of a 
referendum on 27 March on the peninsula's relationship with 
Ukraine and on the dual citizenship problem contravene both 
Ukraine's laws and those of the Republic of Crimea. This was 
stated on 17 March by Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the 
Tatar People's Assembly, in an interview with a NEGA 
correspondent. R. Chubarov personally supports the Ukraine 
president's edict canceling two points in Crimea President Yu. 
Meshkov's edict. In his opinion, "the war of laws unleashed 
between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine, which will have a 
continuation, will push Crimea into an abyss." In which case 
one would not be able to talk about any economic transformations 
on the peninsula, R. Chubarov thinks. 
  The Crimea president's decision to put his representatives 
in 
charge of city and rayon executive committees is drawing 
negative reactions in the regions. In particular, Sergey 
Kunitsyn, chairman of Krasnyy Perekop town soviet and deputy of 
the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, described these intentions 
"illegal and contravening the Constitution of the Republic of 
Crimea." Under the Constitution of Crimea, an executive 
committee is an organ of a soviet, and a soviet is formed 
through the holding of general elections, S. Kunitsin thinks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "There Is Only One Russia, Whereas </F>
Crimean `Sons' Are Plentiful"] 
  [Text] Meetings of two political councils -- of the 
"Russian Society of the Crimea" and of the "Russian Party of 
Sevastopol" -- were held in Simferopol. (On the eve of the 
presidential elections on the peninsula, the "Russian Party of 
Sevastopol" seceded from the "Russian Party of the Crimea" and 
created its own separate organization.) A number of appeals to 
the electorate of the Crimean Republic were adopted, in 
particular, not to take part in the elections to Ukraine's 
Supreme Council and also to the Crimean Supreme Council in 
accordance with party lists. The voters are urged not to accept 
these two ballots at electoral wards. Such a position is due to 
the fact that the aforementioned Crimean movements do not 
consider the Crimea to be a part of Ukrainian territory. 
  With regard to elections to the Crimean parliament, the 
"Russian Society of the Crimea" and the "Russian Party of 
Sevastopol" are convinced that, today, the "Rossiya" [Russia] 
bloc is not what it used to be when it brought [Crimean 
President] Yu. Meshkov to power. According to chairman of the 
"Russian Party of Sevastopol," deputy of the Crimean Supreme 
Council and of the Sevastopol City Council Aleksandr Kruglov, 
the "Rossiya" bloc has been joined by those people who betray 
Russian ideas. The voters are urged to vote for individual 
personalities, proceeding from their specific personal 
characteristics, and not for candidates of the "Rossiya" bloc 
during the Crimean elections to the Supreme Council that will be 
held in accordance with the majority system.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.P. Mezhak, chairman of the Popular Party </F>
of the Crimea, by V. Danilov; place and date not given: 
"`Rossiya' Block Is True to Its Goals"] 
  [Text] [Danilov] Many readers of our newspaper wonder if 
the "Rossiya" [Russia] bloc remains true to its basic principles 
proclaimed during the presidential campaign of Yuriy Meshkov? 
Did this program undergo any changes? 
  [Mezhak] Let me put it straight, we are not going to back 
out 
of a single provision of our program that was adopted at a 
meeting of the bloc's Coordinating Council on 25 February. 
  Our prime goals include the emergence and development of the 
Crimean Republic as an independent and law-abiding democratic 
state, overcoming the economic crisis, and creating conditions 
for a worthy life for Crimean residents, whose interests and 
rights we are going to uphold consistently. The "Rossiya" bloc 
still considers calling a referendum on the Republic's status a 
precondition for establishing the Crimean statehood. Its 
favorable outcome would lay firm the political and legal 
foundation for our state independence, which will enable us to 
conclude political and economic agreements with CIS states. 
  The bloc's ultimate goal is to reestablish unity with Russia 
and other CIS countries and, at the initial stage, form an 
economic, political, and military union, with its consequent 
transformation into a confederation or federal state. 
  [Danilov] According to a decision recently adopted by the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council, the Crimean Republic has no right to 
its own citizenship, its financial and monetary systems, and 
other trappings of statehood. Where would you see a way out of 
the legal "maze" of Ukrainian-Crimean relations? 
  [Mezhak] First, the above decision by the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council is obviously overdue, since the Crimea already has its 
own banking and systems. It also established its own Crimean 
bank, and it was a result of the official negotiations with Kiev 
on power sharing. The Crimean citizenship issue has as strong a 
legal base. So, the Ukrainian Supreme Council's other statement 
about unconformity of the Crimean legislation with the Ukrainian 
one is largely a propagandist move. 
  Second, it is no secret today that policy based on 
administrative restrictions and forcible measures is doomed to 
failure. Processes similar to the Crimean are under way in 
other Ukrainian regions. People striving for integration and 
unity cannot be repressed by directives from above. In his 
recent television appearance in the peninsula, Crimean President 
Yuriy Meshkov stressed that the following passage of the 
question that will be put to a referendum should bear the main 
emphasis: "...in a union with other CIS states." Ukraine is 
certainly among those states, so it would not be serious to call 
us separatists. 
  [Danilov] What kind of Crimean statehood, which we are just 
beginning to build, do you envision? 
  [Mezhak] One should provide all necessary conditions for the 
smooth operation of a multiparty system in the Crimea. The 
"Rossiya" bloc stands for the representative democracy allowing 
all social forces to actually participate in managing the state. 
We want to see the Crimean president as head of the state, and 
the executive branch head elected by and accountable to the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet. However, the best solution at this 
stage of the Crimean independence would be to have the president 
serve as head of state, which would guarantee observance of the 
Crimean Constitution, and at the same time be the head of the 
executive branch. One should ensure representative power for 
local governments, too. 
  Finally, the "Rossiya" bloc considers Sevastopol an 
inalienable part of the Crimea and will seek to establish 
government bodies in the city based on the Crimean legislation. 
  [Danilov] At present, all political parties and figures 
speak 
a lot about human rights. But talking, as everyone knows, does 
not necessarily mean doing. What steps does the "Rossiya" bloc 
plan to undertake in this sphere? 
  [Mezhak] Our priority is to provide legislative support for 
the right of Crimean residents to dual citizenship; first 
citizenship would be Crimean, and the second depending on their 
choice. 
  Another issue playing an important role in our program is 
the 
judicial reform providing for electiveness and independence of 
judges from the power elite, the jury, expansion of legal 
powers, the right of local courts to revoke decisions of local 
executive institutions. 
  It is obvious that there can be no talk about human rights 
until we smash crime that has spread on an unheard-of scale. 
For this purpose, one should improve the material conditions of 
the public order forces. 
  [Danilov] What are the main provisions of the bloc's 
economic program? 
  [Mezhak] Recognition of the open-type economy matched with 
certain protectionist policies of the state with regard to 
Crimean manufacturers. Privatization of production means, 
transfer of property to private manufacturers with the 
preservation of a substantial part of the state sector. At the 
same time, the state would dominate industries of nationwide 
importance or enterprises losing money in the market conditions. 
One needs to conduct agricultural reform, demonopolize 
production, and pass a law on competition. 
  Encouraging production should serve as the basic principle 
of 
the taxation system. 
  A special place in our economic program was given to the 
economic sovereignty of the Crimea, which means its thorough 
financial independence (drafting the budget, setting taxes, 
managing credits and payments, etc.), independent economic 
policies giving the peninsula a free hand in establishing 
priorities in foreign economic links. A system of investment 
privileges needs to be guaranteed by the state to attract 
foreign capital to the Crimea. 
  According to our concept, a broad social base for 
privatization should be ensured by personal accounts [imennoy 
shchet] or securities, including those on land, considering the 
interests of working teams. 
  [Danilov] Can we say that the implementation of your bloc's 
economic program began after Yuriy Meshkov was elected president? 
  [Mezhak] Nomination of the prominent Russian economist, 
Yevgeniy Saburov, testifies to the fact that the Crimean 
president and the "Rossiya" bloc keep the word they gave to 
Crimean residents during the presidential campaign. However, 
our government must find a firm foundation in the peninsula's 
legislative power so it can work undeterred. This is why the 
"Rossiya" bloc attaches such great importance to the upcoming 
elections to the Crimean legislature. 
  [Danilov] What would you name as the core of your program's 
social policies? 
  [Mezhak] The main principle of our social policy is 
supporting a specific individual instead of whole groups. The 
state is supposed to help those who are not in a position to 
make a living through their own work, and to create necessary 
conditions for those who can achieve good results in working for 
the public good. The state must guarantee its citizens free 
health care to the previous extent, and finance science and 
education. 
  According to our program, Crimeans will get the chance to 
receive an education at Russian higher education institutions as 
a result of relevant agreements with the Russian Federation. 
  In the sphere of ethnic relations, we will seek to 
strengthen 
a multinational state on the Crimean peninsula, whose citizens 
will enjoy equal rights and opportunities regardless of their 
nationality and creed.

  [Text] An election meeting of the Officers Union of Crimea 
comprising 500 servicemen of a pro-Russia orientation was held 
in Sevastopol on 20 March. The Officers Union of Crimea 
nominated 11 candidates for the Supreme Soviet of Crimea who 
include Black Sea Fleet servicemen. The Officers Union turned 
to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin and the Russian 
Federation State Duma with a request to speed up the solution of 
the question on placing Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet under 
Russian jurisdiction. An appeal to Republic of Crimea President 
Yuriy Meshkov contains a call to create on the basis of the 
Officers Union a National Guard of Crimea and, in this 
connection, to eliminate on the peninsula's territory the 
National Guard of Ukraine.

<F P=106> ["Abridged" speech by Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman </F>
Ivan Plyushch before delegates of the Consumer Cooperation 
Congress; place and date not given: "Ukraine Is Forever, and it 
Depends on Us Whether it Will Be Happy or Unhappy"] 
  [Text] Consumer cooperatives are serving 23 million 
people, including 9 million shareholders. Their role in our 
social life and economy is significant. When we say that there 
is no alternative to reform, this means that the importance of 
cooperatives will be constantly growing, whether we want this or 
not. 
  I want to draw your attention to those processes that are 
under way in particular in rural areas, and deny allegations by 
those who claim that reform is not advancing. Here are concrete 
figures. In general, the total number of cattle has 
unfortunately been decreasing over recent years. Both the tempo 
and the trend of the decline in the state and kolkhoz sectors 
are steady, and the decrease is measured in millions of head. 
However in [private] village farms, an opposite process is 
under way. In 1993, the data were as follows: The total number 
of cattle went up by 240,000 head, which amounts to the emerging 
of a medium-sized oblast. The number of pigs increased by more 
than 200,000. Converting into symbolic figures the number of 
cattle and pigs raised in the private sector over the last three 
years, we would receive almost a million head. Incidentally, 
the increase rate was almost 13 percent in 1993. 
  What does this mean? If you fail to change your 
infrastructure to account for these changes, an enormous 
incongruity may arise. Your reform and production must be in 
line with the changes and trends currently under way in Ukraine 
as a whole. And instead of reducing and curtailing the scope of 
your activities, you should expand it on a qualitatively new 
basis of cooperation and mutually advantageous contracts. 
  One of the speakers at the congresses maintained that 
consumer cooperation is losing authority. I think this is not 
the case. The only ones to believe this are those who either 
prefer not to notice changes or have not been given to realize 
the actual state of things. 
  Yesterday, Valentin Roshchin, our guest from the Russian 
Federation who is first deputy chairman of Russia's Central 
Union of Consumer Cooperatives, spoke here. He pointed out: "I 
hope that your congress facilitates the revival of cooperatives 
in a new form." Sincerely greeting your congress, I want every 
one of you to leave this hall with a deep conviction that we 
should revive the cooperatives in a new form, the one dreamed 
about by outstanding scientist Oleksandr Vasylyovych Chayanov. 
He depicted its essence as "cooperation of cooperators." Thus, 
the future belongs to you and manufacturers. 
  Next comes the issue of relations between consumer 
cooperatives and the state. I support what I once said in an 
interview with your newspaper VISTI: "Cooperatives are a state 
within the state." I said this many times to people from the 
agro-industrial complex and consumer cooperatives. If you do 
not become a state within the state, we will not change 
production relations. If we fail to do this we will also fail 
to change our attitude toward work and thus, improve our living 
standards. 
  This does not mean that you break away from the state and 
become independent. Everybody depends on the state. Saying 
that manufacturers, entrepreneurs, or cooperative bodies are 
independent is just an invention. They are all dependent 
because they all are parts of the state. The point is how 
dependent they are, whether they are directly subordinated [to 
the state] or they coexist on an agreement, contractual, or 
other bases. I mean that consumer cooperatives should build 
their relations with the state primarily on the basis of 
agreements. If a state delegates some of its functions to 
consumer cooperatives, this should be provided for by an 
agreement and this agreement should be strictly observed. If 
one party or another fails to observe this agreement, the third 
branch of power -- the court -- will have to intervene, and 
everything will be regulated by order of the court. I say this 
not out of desire to pit consumer cooperatives against the 
state, but because this is in line with Ukraine's actual laws 
and the realities of a democratic state of law. 
  Inflation is one of the most acute problems, and one of the 
speakers here has said that it has eaten up your money. Tell 
me, whose money has it not eaten up in Ukraine? It has eaten up 
cooperatives' money, people's savings, state enterprise, 
kolkhoz, and sovkhoz assets. When inflation in a state begins 
to swell, it eats up everyone's money without distinction, but 
the poorest people are afflicted more than others. 
Unfortunately, it happened so that the group of people with 
which consumer cooperatives are dealing is the most impoverished 
one. 
  If someone today is aiming to liquidate village stores or 
introduce such reform that would ban consumer goods from 
villages, this is sabotage and not reform. Those guilty of this 
should be punished by administrative or other measures. 
  There was talk at the congress that there are attempts to 
appropriate consumer cooperatives' property and privatize it. 
We cannot let this happen. Cooperatives alone have the right 
to manage their property. Whenever some property is privatized 
in a normal economy, the state demands that 70 to 80 percent of 
the previous assortment of goods, specialization, and special 
features of this commercial outlet be retained. Thus, neither 
privatization nor any other change in the form of ownership 
should result in shortages of consumer goods in village stores. 
If today it is unprofitable to ship bread to villages -- and 
this is a reality -- this must not be attributed to 
cooperatives. You are performing state functions and should 
have an agreement with the state, which should either partially 
compensate your losses or you will divide them among yourselves, 
or find other mutually advantageous solutions. 
  You all remember the times when there was no difference 
between state commerce and consumer cooperatives, aside from 
better goods being shipped to state stores. Cooperatives did 
not function in accordance with their charter. A legal footing 
has now been created for both consumer cooperatives and other 
forms of ownership. Leasing and sharing are becoming more 
widespread; destatization is under way. This process will be 
expanding. In developed countries, even power plants are in 
private hands, but the energy system is state-run and every 
power plant contributes power and heat to the system. I am not 
speaking about privatizing the power system, perhaps we will 
come to this in 10 years or so. The point is how to make 
consumer cooperatives survive along with other economic 
structures. Are cooperatives in a better situation than state 
commerce or the state production sector? Their situations are 
virtually analogous. 
  Our colleagues from Russia and Moldova spoke here. It turned 
out that we have common problems and, as long as they remain 
unresolved, there will be no stable ties about which some 
political forces like to speculate very much. The ties have 
been disrupted because payment mechanisms ceased to exist. As 
early as three years ago, there were shortages of money. If 
someone tells you that Ukraine abandoned the ruble zone, do not 
believe him. This is being said by those politicians who find 
this statement advantageous. In reality, Ukraine, along with 
other republics, was thrown out of this zone, which was an 
objective process. As we all know, in September 1993, some 
states signed an agreement about the creation of an economic 
union, but as of today, the ruble zone has been created neither 
between Russia and Kazakhstan nor between Russia and Belarus. 
This zone can be created solely under one condition: Either 
Belarus, for example, becomes a part of Russia or the two states 
unite on the same basis as EC countries are trying to, after 40 
years of cooperation. We are not a unique phenomenon and no 
islanders that can do whatever they want. This illusion has 
afflicted severe damage on Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, 
Moldova, and other republics. I think that consumer 
cooperatives must be among the trailblazers in making mutually 
advantageous contacts. We should not think about global 
all-embracing things. Let us first establish normal relations 
between our cooperatives. However, you will set up these 
relations quicker, if instead of a simple exchange of goods 
currently termed barter, the "blood vessel" of the 
financial-credit system starts to function. Who has money for 
this? Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy reported in his 
speech yesterday that a 500-billion karbovantsi credit had been 
earmarked for consumer cooperatives. Did you feel that? Let us 
be frank -- this credit will produce no tangible effects, 
because judging by the data cited here, your projects demand 
more than 10 trillion. When there is no proper correlation 
between products and money, no matter what politicians do, there 
will either be sky-rocketing inflation (which we are 
experiencing today) or a tough financial-credit policy that will 
lead to a normal market, and economic correlation between money 
and product supply. 
  We have started this work, but believe me that we cannot do 
it given our ersatz currency and the inflation rate of 1993. 
This year, a spark of stabilization started burning. Not a 
torch yet, because what kind of stabilization is that, when 
people are not being paid wages and cannot buy products? 
However, this is the kind of spark that gives hope and proves 
that things can be improved. 
  Banks have been bitterly reproached from this rostrum for 
granting high-interest credits and reaping dividends. This is 
also a reproach for me, because the National Bank is 
subordinated to the Supreme Council. However, the Supreme 
Council does not manage banks as was said here. We do not 
exercise this kind of control. The National Bank is 
subordinated solely to the law and depends on the Supreme 
Council, only in the sense that the latter passes laws on bank 
activities. 
  The National Bank's function is to oversee the proportion 
"money -- product -- money," while the issuance of credits 
belongs to commercial or departmental banks. There are voices 
calling to nationalize these. However, this is not the kind of 
road for us to choose. We should encourage competition between 
banks. If we want to go back to the administrative-command 
system and totalitarianism, then we should proclaim them state 
banks. However, we cannot go back to what once existed. Thus, 
we must act in such a way as to make banks have interest in 
manufacturers. According to Chayanov, the nature of market 
relations envisions that if someone comes and buys something, 
the seller should give him an award. If a shareholder, a 
farmer, or a village resident deposits his money in a bank, this 
must be advantageous for him. However today, everything is the 
other way around. There is just one solution, that is to put an 
end to the monopoly of these banks. 
  What Ivan Illich Bakhchyvanzhi from Odessa Oblast told us 
here, and he was not the only one to say this, means that you 
are able to create your own bank within your system. It will 
interact with you and other banks, and then you will get things 
going. Then, the interest-increase curve will begin to decline, 
because you will be able to bargain about credit interest rates, 
doing this on mutually advantageous terms. It is good that you 
are already laying the foundation of your bank. I know about 
the agreement to allot a certain sum of state money for this 
bank, so as to let you purchase small bakeries for rural areas, 
about which there was talk here, freezers, and other equipment; 
as well as more actively carry out reform in your sector. 
  Important issues, not only for consumer cooperation, have 
been brought up in this hall. I am grateful that you have given 
the floor to village and rayon council heads and a school 
principal. Cooperative workers from different oblasts told us a 
lot of interesting things. One can feel that despite tremendous 
hardships, you have had good initiative on the way to the 
market. These sprouts have been conditioned by life. 
  I am sure you can cite a lot of concrete places in which 
reform in different spheres is advancing despite all the 
obstacles. 
  Two years ago, one of the managers from Donetsk Oblast, 
asked 
by me why people had not been allotted land for vegetable and 
collective gardening, answered with surprise: "Do you mean we 
have to give them blackland?" This is some stance indeed! 
People can be given slopes, ditches, and other worthless 
patches of land, but by no means blackland. 
  However in spring, grass will grow even through asphalt. Let 
me cite these figures: Over the last four years, the volume of 
areas earmarked for vegetable and collective gardening has 
significantly increased. What have been the results of this? 
Here I have data from some oblasts. In previous years, more 
than 100,000 tonnes of potatoes were shipped yearly for the 
needs of Kiev residents. In 1993, 16,000 tonnes were shipped, 
and now nobody knows what to do with them. The point is that 
the production of potatoes by all the social groups in the 
oblast has grown more than twofold. The same thing happened in 
Dnepropetrovsk Oblast. Some 37,000 to 40,000 tonnes of potatoes 
used to be shipped to Zaporozhye Oblast every autumn, in 
accordance with the central plan. In 1993, the figure was 6,000 
tonnes, and nobody in the city complained about shortages. It 
turned out that potatoes grow there as well. Under the old 
economic system, potatoes would not grow in southern oblasts, 
but when land was given to the people, they started to grow in 
both Zaporozhye and Dnepropetrovsk Oblasts. I could cite more 
examples of this kind. 
  You have repeatedly mentioned the Law on Consumer 
Cooperation 
here, adopted by the Supreme Soviet. In my opinion, it is far 
from ideal, but it has opened the door for you and provided a 
legal footing for developing your structures. However, 
commenting on that law, one senior official once said: "I have 
all grounds to claim that the law on cooperation is a result of 
a bribe." [words within quotation marks in Russian] You might 
be perplexed to hear this phrase, but it is a reverberation of 
times wept for by some people. Of course, such managers do not 
like reform in consumer cooperation, because cooperative members 
no longer address them with these kinds of questions: "Ivan 
Petrovych, we have received five freezers, 10 suits, and 30 
shirts. To whom shall we sell them?" Such managers do not care 
about baby food or our other hardships. 
  However now, you must become the only masters of your 
system. 
You have held 36,000 accounting conferences on all levels, and 
this congress crowns your work. Thus, you should decide how to 
live and continue your work. Today, law provides a legal 
footing for consumer cooperation. If you make right decisions, 
people will be grateful to you; if your decisions are faulty you 
feel the consequences. There exists a wise saying: "The trial 
and error method is not the best one, but nothing better has 
been discovered so far." One should not simply mark time; one 
should move forward and make progress, stumbling. The only ones 
to make no mistakes are those who do no work. 
  You say that your best people abandon you for commercial 
structures. If you cannot create conditions like those in 
commercial structures, the outflow of people will continue. You 
must create conditions to make people come to you and not vice 
versa. In my opinion, employees will not abandon Ivan Illich 
because the conditions created in his organization grant both 
good wages and supplies for village people. If you fail to do 
this, you will lose your workers. 
  I would like to say a couple of words regarding the essence 
of our political reform. 
  In 1990, the Supreme Council was elected and is now 
completing its work. We have lived through many things over the 
last four years: We have passed the Declaration of Ukrainian 
Sovereignty and the Act of Independence; debunked the 
administrative-command system and everything that accompanied 
it; and created more or less democratic conditions. For the 
first time ever, opposition has been formed in the legislature 
which, according to international norms and rules, is a 
necessary attribute of every parliament. Lack of opposition 
amounts to monopoly on power and lack of democracy. 
  Over that period, we have passed more than 400 laws and 1000 
resolutions. Political forces give different evaluation of 
these laws on the eve of elections. Some claim that these laws 
cause anarchy, while others say that they want to enter the new 
legislature to rescind everything adopted by the current Supreme 
Council. However, we should go to the Supreme Council to 
continue the creation of a legal footing for radical reform, 
modify and improve existing laws. 
  It depends on us whom we will elect on 27 March. After this 
day, there will be no one to blame. Thus, I am addressing you 
as the cadre dealing with 23 million people, including 10 
million in the heart of the country. We should kneel before 
these people and thank them for tolerating us. 
  We should tell them: Empower those whom you believe 
trustworthy. This power should act and not be afraid of 
anything, because it is popular, that is elected by the people. 
  We already have a legislative basis for village people 
electing village heads, rayon residents -- rayon heads, town 
residents -- town heads, oblast residents -- oblast heads, and 
the entire Ukrainian nation -- the Supreme Council and the 
president. Deputies of representing organs of power will also 
be elected in villages, towns, rayons, and oblasts. 
  Thus, the legal footing for holding democratic elections has 
been formed. The newly elected legislature, along with the rest 
of the nation, will have to continue the development of a 
democratic state. Please, believe that Ukraine is forever, and 
it depends on us whether it will be happy or unhappy.

  [Excerpt] Kiev -- UNIAN has learned that Ukraine's State 
Committee for Control of Work Safety in Nuclear Engineering 
[Derzhatomnahlyad] disagreed with the safety level assessment of 
the fire at the Khmelnitskiy AES given by the State Committee 
for the Use of Nuclear Power [Derzhkomatom]. The head of 
Derzhatomnahlyad's scientific and technical directorate, Vadym 
Hryshchenko, told UNIAN that although the radioactive situation 
had not deteriorated, a fire always posed a potential threat of 
weakening safety control systems in the power unit. Therefore, 
this case should be classified on the international scale of 
incidents as first level, not zero level. Derzhatomnahlyad has 
reported its verdict to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Sea Fleet"] 
  [Text] On the evening on 17 March, near the Crimean 
shores, a large-scale Black Sea Fleet exercise started. It was 
meant to develop methods of conducting combat operations against 
submarines of an imaginary adversary with an active air force 
counteraction. On the morning of 18 March, as many as 25 ships, 
two submarines, and five auxiliary ships were already involved 
in the exercise. They occupied the area from Donuzlav (western 
shore) to Kerch (in the east). The exercise had been 
coordinated with Russia's Ministry of Defense. As our 
correspondent was told at the Press Center of Ukraine's Ministry 
of Defense, the Black Sea Fleet Command had not informed 
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense of this exercise.

learned today that heating in Ukraine's residential buildings 
and at enterprises will be switched off before the end of March 
rather than on 15 April as was the case previously. Commenting 
on the situation, Oleksiy Sheberstov, Ukraine's first deputy 
minister of power engineering and electrification, said 
Ukraine's fuel supplies are rapidly diminishing. At the same 
time, consumers owe 8,000 billion karbovantsi to the ministry, 
which is the reason why it lacks the money to buy oil and gas 
for heating.

  [Text] London March 21 TASS -- A meeting between President 
of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, who arrived here on an 
official visit, and British Prime Minister John Major ended 
after signing a number of important bilateral agreements in 
London today. 
  The documents included a joint declaration on friendship and 
mutual understanding, an agreement on cooperation in the spheres 
of education, science and culture, a joint declaration on 
economic cooperation, a convention on avoiding double taxation, 
an agreement on air transport and a declaration on cooperation 
between foreign political departments. 
  In honour of the esteemed guest a guard-of-honour was 
presented and Kazakhstan's national anthem was played in the 
British Foreign Office yard. 
  Summing up the results of the talks, John Major said that 
discussions were held on questions of investment in Kazakhstan's 
economy, and also on steps to increase turnover. The head of 
the British Government noted that the development of cooperation 
in these spheres will help good relations established between 
Great Britain and Kazakhstan. He emphasised that his government 
will explore opportunities for the implementation of the 
understandings already reached. 
  The British prime minister accepted Nursultan Nazarbayev's 
invitation to visit Kazakhstan. He also highly appreciated 
Nazarbayev's initiative to call a conference on steps to 
increase trust and security in Asia. This question was 
comprehensively discussed at the meeting, and the foreign 
ministers of the two countries are continuing consultations on 
this topic, John Major added.

  [Text] London March 22 TASS--Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, currently on an official visit to Great Britain, met 
with representatives of British business circles on Monday. 
  The Kazakh president said that the sides displayed mutual 
interest in expanding bilateral cooperation. "I believe that a 
mutual interest in exchange of opinions will help us to know 
each other better and determine prospects for and forms of 
development of mutually advantageous contacts," the Kazakh 
president said, addressing the Confederation of the British 
Industry, uniting prominent businessmen of the country. 
  The basis for Kazakh-British relations was laid in October, 
1991, when during Nazarbayev's first visit a joint statement was 
signed, determining principles and prospects for bilateral 
cooperation. Nowadays, Great Britain ranks fifth in the Kazakh 
trade turnover with foreign countries. 
  "Today, we can discuss concrete directions of our 
cooperation 
in the oil and gas industries, ferrous and non-ferrous metal 
industry and banking business," the Kazakh president told 
British businessmen. Nazarbayev mentioned the Lonrho, British 
Gas, AGIP, British Petroleum, the Bank of England and some other 
companies and banks successfully cooperating with Kazakhstan. 
  "At the same time, we realise that this is only the start, 
opening a broader road for the development of large-scale and 
perspective projects. The course of transformations and reforms 
carried out by Kazakhstan will receive the support of the world 
community. At the beginning of 1994, international financial 
organisations and 15 countries,including Britain, decided to 
allocate to Kazakhstan over one billion dollars in credits and 
loans. 
  "We are optimistic about Kazakhstan's projects," Nazarbayev 
said. However, complex problems, connected with hardships of a 
transitional period, remain. We hope that state-owned and 
private companies and business circles of Great Britain will 
display an interest and find spheres and facilities in 
Kazakhstan worthy to be invested and actively participate in 
unique transformations underway in our country," Nazarbayev said.

fuels and lubricants as well as munition. There were no 
casualties or damage. Appropriate agencies started an 
investigation. 
  The area of the 12th and 13th posts of the Moskovskiy border 
guard unit were fired at with heavy machine guns and rocket 
shells from inside Afghanistan at 16:30 on March 20. The border 
guards returned fire and wiped out the enemy firing positions. 
There were no casualties among the Russian border guards. Armed 
groups and hardware of Tajik opposition were seen to move 
actively in the Afghan area opposite the 1st post of the Pyanj

  [Text] A strict daily record of all fuels and lubricants 
coming into the country through state and commercial channels 
has been introduced in Tajikistan. From now until 1 May, only 
the country's top ministrial and departmental chiefs can use 
official vehicles. In addition, in order to eradicate price 
chaos, a specially created republic commission has been tasked 
with establishing maximum prices for fuels and lubricants. The 
use of fuel by motor-vehicle transport has been restricted. All 
these measures are prompted by the fact that large-scale sowings 
have begun in the Republic and many farms are missing the 
optimum deadlines owing to a shortage of fuel. The Ministry of 
Agriculture has announced that this spring Tajik peasants are 
allocating 280-285,000 hectares to the basic crop -- cotton -- 
which is somewhat in excess of last year's indicator.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin report: "'Partnership for Peace': The </F>
Duma Doubts: Is It Really Partnership?"] 
  [Text] The State Duma has held hearings on the question of 
Russia's affiliation (or nonaffiliation) to the "Partnership for 
Peace" program. The hearings were conducted on the initiative 
of the parliamentary Defense Committee under the chairmanship of 
Sergey Yushenkov. 
  The position of the Foreign Ministry and the Defense 
Ministry 
was unambiguous: Joining in the "Partnership for Peace" program 
is in the interests of Russia and its security. For example, 
Major General Pavel Zolotarev, representative of the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry, stressed that this option will lead 
"from political containment by means of deterrence to political 
containment by means of cooperation." The advantages are 
obvious: It will enable Russia to demonstrate to the whole world 
its political will for the active building of collective 
security, the anti-Russian forces seeking to isolate our country 
in the international arena will be neutralized, effective 
mechanisms for the containment of troops will be created, a 
single approach to the assessment of a threat to Russia's 
security will be elaborated, full strategic partnership will be 
established, the system of joint peacemaking operations will 
become more effective, cooperation in the field of combatting 
nuclear terrorism and industrial catastrophes can be rehearsed, 
and so forth. 
  In any event, as the representatives of the Foreign Ministry 
and Defense Ministry stressed, "to disregard" the "Partnership 
for Peace" program would mean for Russia quite simply a 
disastrous self-isolation from the processes of the pan-European 
search for collective security. If we ignore the NATO 
countries' initiative the result may be that our country will 
eventually find itself isolated. 
  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma International Relations 
Committee, and Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the Committee on 
CIS Affairs, expressed a critical view of the idea of Russia's 
participation in the "partnership." They expressed the fear 
that "one side may be able to impose its diktat" given the 
conditions proposed by NATO. In Lukin's opinion, involvement in 
the "partnership" would wreck "our strategic intentions to 
create security structures within the CIS framework." 
  The overall course of the hearings showed that there are 
major forces in the State Duma who are skeptical of Russia's 
involvement in the "Partnership for Peace" program.

  [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- Not a single provision in 
the State Duma resolution on amnesty will be reversed or 
reconsidered, Duma Deputy Chairman Valentin Kovalyov said. 
  Kovalyov said that a working group has prepared a draft 
resolution on the application of the amnesty resolution. He did 
not rule out the possibility that the draft may be submitted to 
the Duma on Friday. 
  "The idea of the document is to specify the provisions which 
may be interpreted in different ways. Particularly, the draft 
stipulates that the amnesty resolution shall not stop legal 
proceedings instituted against those who committed criminal 
offences during the August 1991, May 1993 and October 1993 
events which were not directly connected with these events," 
Kovalyov said. 
  In accordance with this provision, marauders who plundered 
the parliament building during the October revolt in Moscow or 
thieves will not be amnestied. "Only those are subject to 
amnesty whose actions were in the cause-effect relation with the 
political events in August, May and October," Kovalyov explained. 
  He noted that the draft resolution is the result of 
agreement 
between all participants in the work on it, including deputies, 
representatives of the public prosecutor's office, the 
ministries of justice and foreign affairs and presidential 
representatives.

  [Text] Moscow March 18 TASS -- The Russian parliament's 
lower house, the State Duma, again postponed the approval of its 
working procedure until a later date. Speaker Ivan Rybkin told 
lawmakers the committee for organization of the Duma's 
activities discovered during the lunch-break that many of the 
amendments moved by people's deputies before discussing the 
working procedure in the second reading were not taken into 
account. 
  Meanwhile, the first half of today's plenary meeting of the 
State Duma was focused on this issue. Ultranationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
made another attempt to talk lawmakers into approving the 
amendment moved by his party about the so-called "imperative 
mandate". Under this amendment, a deputy quitting a 
parliamentary faction is to be stripped of his credentials and 
replaced by the next member on the party list. To push this 
amendment through parliament, Zhirinovskiy promised to the 
deputies' groups "December 12 Union" and "Russian Path", which 
were denied registration because of insufficient numerical 
strength, that the Liberal Democratic faction would vote for an 
amendment reducing the number of deputies required for 
registration. The Liberal Democrat leader suggested that the 
two amendments be voted as a "package", but lawmakers rejected 
the suggestion.

<F P=106> [Rodion Ivanov report under the "Parliament" rubric: "How </F>
Much Money To Give to the Government? Duma Committee for 
Budget, Finance, Banks, and Credits Debated Wisdom of Presenting 
Quarterly Budgets"] 
  [Text] An incomplete draft 1994 budget message came to the 
State Duma on the evening of 19 March with its classified part 
coming to the chamber yesterday morning. Yesterday, the Duma 
budget committee looked at the government's request to provide 
it with 10.6 million rubles [R] toward financing state outlays 
in April and May 1994. The cabinet had sent in a draft law 
where the government authorized the release of the given sum 
proceeding from the draft budget for this year, taking account 
of the current situation in the financial sphere and the receipt 
of money by the state treasury and the Central Bank cash 
department. The committee at first ruled that financing should 
be kept open throughout the first quarter, while the sum to be 
released should be further discussed with the Finance Ministry. 
Besides, out of the basis, only proportions of the 1994 budget 
remained. The committee then passed an amendment proposed by 
its deputy chairman Aleksandr Pochinok to the effect that the 
law should regulate the allocation of money throughout the first 
half- year. In this manner members of the committee decided to 
eliminate inconsistencies in the proportions of financing: most 
of the money spent in the first quarter had been earmarked by 
the government for defense and the law enforcement organs rather 
than on social spending. Incidentally, R7.5 trillion known to 
have been earmarked under the president's edict for the first 
three months of 1994 was spent approximately early in March. 
  Inconsistencies in financing proportions compelled members 
of 
the budget committee to make a decision on whether the 
government should submit to the Duma, in addition to the annual 
budget, its quarter- by-quarter breakdown. This was sharply 
opposed by committee deputy chairman Gennadiy Kulik, who stated 
that this would cause a quarrel between the Duma and the 
government. Aleksandr Pochinok supported his colleague, saying 
that the Duma would in fact return the annual budget without 
discussing it if it sets the given condition: a mandatory 
quarter-by-quarter presentation.

  [Text] Major General Aleksandr Shcherbakov, deputy 
commander of the Russian Border Guards, called for signing 
international agreements on the Russian state border. 
  He told the State Duma Tuesday that the country's maritime 
frontiers with the U.S. or Japan had not been defined and that 
five out of 110 Russian Border Guard districts were outside the 
Russian Federation. 
  Parliamentary hearings on the status of the Russian border 
are underway in the State Duma Geopolitics Committee chaired by 
retired general Viktor Ustinov, Liberal Democrat. 
  Shcherbakov thought that a comprehensive federal program was 
needed for development of border areas and that work on the 
doctrine for guarding the Russian Federation's border in the 
Central Asian region had to be continued. 
  Shcherbakov said that over 3500 border infiltrators had been 
detained in 1993. Contraband worth 3.5 Bn rubles, over 700 guns 
and 4200 kg of narcotic drugs were found on them. Over 700 
people were killed when they tried to cross the Tajik-Afghan 
border illegally. 
  He called for repeal of voluntary service in trouble spots 
and of numerous deferments of military service because the armed 
forces, he said, were manned with ill-educated people. He also 
called for making 19 the drafting age. 
  The draft resolution of the hearings tells the committee to 
table a State Duma draft of amendments to the State Border Act 
adopted by the former Supreme Soviet on April 1, 1993. The 
draft also calls for "speedier submission to the State Duma of 
bills on the Russian Federation's exclusive economic zone, 
continental shelf and legislation on their protection."

  [Text] Yerevan/Moscow March 21 TASS - A group of experts 
from the Iranian air forces and civil aviation agency, headed by 
General Ali Rezvani, arrived on Monday to the site of a crash of 
the Iranian C-130 aircraft which killed 34 people on Friday, 
Armenian Vice-President Gagik Arutyunyan told reporters today. 
  The plane had to fly through the Armenian airspace bound for 
Tehran, but deviated 100 kilometres from the route for unknown 
reasons and hit the ground several miles of [as received] 
Stepanakert, the adminstrative centre of the break-away 
Nagorno-Karabakh province of Azerbaijan. 
  The group of Iranian experts is accompanied by a civil 
aviation official of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
According to the vice-president, experts are expected to 
complete the investigation and be back in yerevan later in the 
day. 
  The vice president stated that there had been no radio 
communication betwen traffic controllers of the Yerevan airport 
and the crew of the Iranian plane. Both the traffic controllers 
and the crew communicated with a Russian passenger aircraft 
which was on its regular flight in the Armenia's airspace at the 
moment. Records of these conversations are now being studied by 
experts. 
  Meanwhile, Russian military experts do not exclude a 
possibility that the Iranian C-130 plane was on a reconnaissance 
mission in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  The experts believe that it is most unlikely that the crash 
had been caused by the depressurization of the cockpit. 
  Colonel Aleksey Grekhov, navigator-inspector of the safety 
department of the military transport aviation of the Russian air 
forces, told ITAR-TASS that "there had not been a single case 
when an airplane hit the ground because of depressurization". 
According to the colonel, almost all air trafic in the Afghan 
war had been carried out by depressurized aircraft "but all 
flights were a success unless the planes had been attacked". 
  The experts are cautious about any resolute conclusions 
until 
they get answers to some questions. Why did the crew of the 
plane have an unusually big number of members (13 instead of a 
regular crew of four)? Why did not the plane ask for landing in 
Gyandzha or Shamkhor in Azerbaijan where runways of former 
Soviet military airfields were big enough for all types of heavy 
planes? Why did the plane maintain radio exchange only with a 
Russian aircraft and not with any of the ground services?

  [Text] Tehran March 22 TASS -- The Iranian Foreign Ministry 
rejected on Tuesday reports that the Iranian cargo plane C-130 
which crashed last Friday in Nagorno-Karabakh, was on a 
reconnaissance mission. 
  A ministry official told ITAR-TASS that an official 
statement 
of the Foreign Ministry on the matter will follow soon. 
  The catastrophe killing 34 people occured when a 
Tehran-bound 
Iranian cargo plane instead of entering the Armenian airspace 
suddenly changed course due to unknown reasons and hit the 
ground several miles off Stepanakert, the administrative centre 
of the disputed Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.

  [Text] Baku (March 19) TURAN [dateline as received]--The 
wreck of Iran's airplane, a C-130 Hercules, which occurred on 
March 18 in Nagorno-Karabakh is in the focus of attention of 
politicians and military officials. Armenian authorities which 
have control over Nagorno-Karabakh said that the plane crashed 
to into mountains due to thick fog. Thirty two people with 9 
children among them died. Iran's Embassy in Moscow reports that 
the crew of the plane included families of Iran's diplomats. 
  The press service of the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry told 
TURAN that on March 17 at 23.00 p.m. Iran's transport plane 
entered Azerbaijan's air space from Georgia and then had to 
depart from it in the direction of Armenia after a few minutes. 
The pilot lost the course. Though Azeri control services tried 
to resume connection with the pilot they couldn't. Soon the 
plane was over Karabakh to the west of international air space. 
  Azeri radar installations followed the flight of Iran's 
plane 
until 23.30 at which point they lost sight of it. At that time 
the plane was near Khankendi (Stepanakert). Military experts 
say that the plane immediately disappeared from the radars' 
screen which proves that the plane was shot down. However, in 
order to draw a final conclusion we have to investigate the 
wreckage of the plane. But will Armenian authorities allow the 
experts including from the international community to visit the 
site of the wreck? 
  Sources in the President's staff and the Azerbaijan Defense 
Ministry opposed Armenian authorities' version. They say that 
the weather was fine and the plane flew at average height. They 
report that Iran's plane turned to find the right course when 
was shot down by Armenian forces which mistook it for an Azeri 
plane. 
  The Ministry for National Security of Azerbaijan confirm 
this 
version. Yesterday the Azeri Ministry reported that it has a 
tape- recording between Khankendi (Stepanakert) and Yerevan 
proving that the Azeri plane was shot down at night on March 18. 
The leader of the press service of the Ministry of National 
Security said that Azerbaijan is ready to present the 
tape-recording to any party concerned.

  [Text] As has already been reported, an aircraft flying 
from Moscow to Tehran crashed in Nagorno-Karabakh on the night 
of 18 March [date as given]. Besides sincere condolences, the 
air crash, in which Iranian citizens died, also elicited the 
interest of the world press. It would not be proper to air 
(?speculations) and [words indistinct] in a newscast. [words 
indistinct] What are the preliminary results of the 
investigation? 
  Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan briefed reporters 
today on the results of investigation into the circumstances 
leading to the crash of the military transport plane. Russian 
and Iranian experts are involved in the investigation. Two 
Iranian delegations have already gone to the site of the crash. 
One of them is headed by (Akbar Aminali), head of the legal 
affairs department at the Iranian Foreign Ministry, and the 
technical delegation is headed by General Ali (Asistas) Rezvani. 
  The crash site has been sealed off by Nagorno-Karabakh 
troops 
and security forces. 
  The bodies of the victims were brought to Yerevan today. 
They will be transported to Iran. 
  The Preliminary investigation shows that the plane deviated 
from its path by some 100 km. The crew did not communicate with 
air traffic controllers at Yerevan's Zvartnots Airport. Will it 
be possible to find the black box? According to [words 
indistinct], this is not yet clear. The aircraft is 
American-built; this type of aircraft is not always equipped 
with such an important device. 
  The Iranian side has no complaints about the work done by 
the 
Armenian establishments that are helping the investigation into 
the circumstances of the tragedy. 
  Vice President Arutyunyan said that the next press briefing 
to reporters will be (?held) at the presidential press 
secretariat.

  [Text] Yerevan, MARCH 21 (SNARK)--There may be no black box 
in the Iranian airplane crashed in Karabakh last week. The 
Armenia's Vice-President Gagik Arutyunyan told about that today 
at the press-briefing for reporters. He said that airplanes 
S-130 [as received] don't always have black boxes. 
  Mr. Arutyunyan pointed out that the Iranian special 
commission together with the CIS and Armenia representatives 
flew off to the accident's place in Karabakh. 
  According to clarified data, 34 people died as a result of 
this accident, including women and children. Their remains were 
delivered in Yerevan, and on March 21 they will be conveyed to 
Iran. 
  Mr. Arutyunyan also said that according to data received 
from 
the Iran Embassy to Yerevan, the airplane tried to make an 
emergency landing. It lost height and got from 7500 to 3500 
meters. The Armenian dispatching service tried to get him 
through the Russian airplane flying from Mineralnye Vody [name 
as received] to the Arabian Emirates. However this attempt 
wasn't a success.

<F P=106> [Viktor Zamyatin report: "New Appointments at Foreign </F>
Ministry. Russia Thinks it Already Has Peacekeeping Mandate"] 
  [Text] Commenting on his rumored appointment as Russian 
ambassador to the United Nations, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey 
Lavrov was concise: rumors are there, the decision is not. 
Even so, his contacts with the United Nations remain close, and 
Mr. Lavrov agreed yesterday to present to KOMMERSANT-DAILY his 
view of Russia's relationship with this organization. The 
deputy minister began by denying mass media reports about 
Russia's soliciting UN permission for peacekeeping missions in 
the CIS. 
  According to Mr. Lavrov, being a foreign policy tool, the 
United Nations cannot be important in itself. UN decisions are 
always a compromise, hence proposals, in particular from Russia, 
do not go through every time. Making use of the United Nations, 
Lavrov said, is important for Russia for two reasons. First, 
because Russia's interests are recognized on an international 
scale; second, because countries elaborating a decision are 
invited for joint actions. By way of examples where Moscow's 
stance is recognized and implemented, Mr. Lavrov referred to UN 
resolutions on the human rights situation in Latvia and Estonia, 
and on the withdrawal of troops from there, as well as the 
decision to create the position of high commissioner for human 
rights. 
  Touching on peacekeeping in the CIS, Mr. Lavrov stated that 
protecting its interests, Russia needs no UN or CSCE permission 
for such an activity because it does not contravene 
international law and the UN Charter (which contains no 
corresponding provisions). Saying this, Sergey Lavrov pointed 
out that the United Nations should be more active in the zones 
of conflicts and share the burden of Russia's expenses. Mr. 
Lavrov sees no sensation in Shevardnadze's call for bringing UN 
forces into Georgia -- Kozyrev and Aleksandr Chikvaidze, head of 
the Georgian Foreign Ministry, came forward with such a call 
last summer. But the United Nations is dragging its feet on the 
decision, which is why the responsibility for disrupting the 
Sochi accords rests on it, Mr. Lavrov thinks. The deputy 
minister announced that this problem will be discussed during a 
visit by Butros Butros-Ghali. 
  On the problem of sanctions, Mr. Lavrov said that in 
Moscow's 
opinion there is no longer any need to press them against 
Yugoslavia because Belgrade has meet all the conditions imposed 
on it. But Moscow's proposals on humanitarian supplies, Lavrov 
said, are being blocked by the United States. This is also true 
about Iraq -- the United Nations is now discussing the question 
of revising the sanctions. Baghdad, Lavrov thinks, has also met 
the UN demand for disarmament and opening its defense program to 
monitoring which is, incidentally, the condition for lifting the 
embargo on exports of its oil. Mr. Lavrov detailed the opinion 
of the Foreign Ministry, where they think that a six-month 
monitoring period could be imposed following which the 
oil-export embargo could be lifted (Paris agrees with Moscow on 
that). Libya is a more difficult case. Al-Qadhdhafi has not so 
far extradited the terrorists, and Russia will have to work on 
that yet, Mr. Lavrov concluded. 
  [International Life Desk commentary] The most striking thing 
in the deputy foreign minister's interview is that his words on 
peacekeeping in the CIS echo the provisions in Boris Yeltsin's 
message to the Federal Assembly. As many people know, the 
United Nations and the CSCE still will not recognize the Russian 
troops' status as peacekeeping forces, or finance their part in 
settling conflicts in the CIS. Now Moscow states straight out 
that it is not going to solicit permission for protecting its 
own interests. Yet another point -- the deputy minister's words 
about sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and 
Iraq having lost their usefulness. It is not for nothing that 
the United States opposes their lifting, having in mind the 
presence of Russian interests in these countries. Moscow's 
stance in regard to the sanctions (despite its support by a 
number of European countries) may spark tension in its relations 
with the United States and the West as a whole.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Krushinskiy: "A New Pole? U.S. Diktat </F>
Encourages Japanese-Chinese Rapprochement"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Mar -- Is Clinton familiar with 
Bismarck's advice to avoid wars "on two fronts"? That we do not 
know, but it is a fact that Washington's nerve centers, 
seriously believing in a "unipolar" world following the collapse 
of the USSR, have been intent on picking fights with both China 
and Japan of late, consequently finding themselves on the brink 
of cold war simultaneously with the largest state and the most 
highly developed state in the Asian-Pacific region. 
  This was a striking feature of Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to 
Beijing. Of course, there was no direct evidence of any 
anti-American slant to the rapprochement that was apparent here, 
nor was that a possibility. It is indicative, though, that at a 
joint press conference by the two states' heads of government, 
Hosokawa vigorously supported China in its resistance to U.S. 
diktat that is being applied under the banner of "protection of 
human rights." The Japanese premier described the U.S. attempt 
to impose its "values" on the countries of the Asian continent 
as a mistake. 
  There was much to be read between the lines in a number of 
his other speeches during his three-day stay in China. He said, 
for example, that Japan has looked again in depth at the lessons 
of the past and intends to shape its relationship with the PRC 
in the spirit of friendship and cooperation with a view to the 
future. He marveled at China's economic achievements and the 
confidence of the Chinese in their future. 
  The words contained in the speeches by the guest and his 
hospitable hosts in favor of a fair economic order appeared to 
be indirectly addressed to Washington politicians who are using 
economic sanctions in an attempt to intimidate both Japan and 
China (which now faces the threat of losing is status of 
most-favored nation in trade with the United States). Is all 
this going to result in a further weakening of U.S. prestige in 
the region? 
  In these conditions, further rapprochement promises a great 
deal for Beijing and Tokyo. Japan is already China's number one 
partner both in terms of trade and in terms of investments. 
Further access to Japanese technological achievements could be 
a major instrument of modernization for this giant state. China 
represents for Japan a boundless market that can considerably 
alleviate the consequences of potential U.S. trade sanctions. 
  If there is a further deepening of bilateral cooperation, 
these two Asian powers could become in the future a kind of 
political-economic "pole" no less powerful than the United 
States coupled with NATO.

Tsutomu Hata demanded Monday that North Korea let international 
experts carry out a full inspection of its nuclear facilities 
and criticized Pyonyang's renewed threat to pull out of the 
Nuclear non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  "Japan is worried by the fact that we could not obtain 
confirmation of the non-use by North Korea of nuclear materials 
for military purposes," Hata said at a news conference.

  [Text] Moscow, March 21 KYODO -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev proposed on Monday [21 March] a new framework of 
talks by the United States, Russia and China with North Korea 
over its suspected development of nuclear weapons, Japanese 
officials said. Kozyrev disclosed the idea during a meeting 
with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Moscow, the 
officials said. 
  Kozyrev also urged Pyongyang to abide by controls on nuclear 
facilities as imposed under the international nuclear safeguard 
agreement, they said. He argued that all controls should be 
abided by through inspections by experts from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the officials said. 
  High-level talks between the U.S. and North Korea have 
stalled in the wake of the IAEA's report that its inspection of 
Pyongyang's nuclear facilities had been obstructed and the 
collapse of the dialogue between North and South Korea. The IAEA 
adopted a resolution Monday to refer North Korea's refusal of 
full inspections of its nuclear facilities to the United Nations 
Security Council.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Japan will continue to make efforts to ensure a 
resolution to the territorial dispute, the conclusion of a peace 
agreement and complete normalization of relations with Russia, 
director of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's international press 
department Seiji Morimoto stated during a briefing in Moscow on 
Monday. 
  He said that this position was set forth by Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata during his talks with Russia's Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday morning. To quote 
Morimoto, the Japanese side emphasized that the declaration 
signed in Tokyo last December by the Russian president and the 
Japanese prime minister creates a basis for broadening political 
dialogue between the two countries. 
  The Japanese diplomat also said that Japan would continue to 
support the Russian reforms and coordinate its moves with the 
G-7. During the talks Chernomyrdin and Hata stressed that Russia 
and Japan could jointly tackle major international problems. 
  Morimoto also said that the talks with the Russian prime 
minister had convinced Japan that relations with Japan were one 
of the priority aspects of Russia's foreign policy. "Neighbors 
are not chosen. As neighbors, Russia and Japan must cooperate," 
he said. 
  He pointed out that the Japanese foreign minister was 
satisfied with the discussion of the territorial issue. The 
Russian prime minister confirmed Russia's adherence to the Tokyo 
declaration and stated that a time would come when the 
territorial problems would be solved. 
  "This problem is very complicated and we are well aware that 
it cannot be solved at one go," said Morimoto. He also 
announced that Hata had invited Chernomyrdin to visit Japan this 
year. In Chernomyrdin [as received] invited Hata to visit 
Moscow. The dates of the visit will be coordinated through 
diplomatic channels. 
  Russia's possible admission to the G-7 was not discussed in 
detail, said Morimoto. Japan believes, however, that G-7 should 
broaden cooperation with Russia. "Such an initiative must come 
from Italy, because it currently chairs the G-7 and is the 
organizer of the forthcoming summit in Naples. Let us hope that 
this problem will be solved," he said.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev believes 
that this summer the G-7 summit in Naples will discuss the 
gradual transformation of the G-7 into a G-8, because Russia 
will join full-scale discussions of the political problems. He 
made the statement Monday following the talks with Japanese 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Kozyrev said he had discussed the problem with Hata. The 
Japanese side reacted positively, he said. 
  Kozyrev said that in Moscow, on the initiative of the 
Japanese side, the issue was discussed on signing a peace treaty 
which would include the territorial problem. "We do not give up 
on the problem. It will be discussed in detail on the basis of 
the Tokyo Declaration at the talks to be held by deputy foreign 
ministers, he said. 
  Kozyrev said that the territorial problem is not the sole 
issue in the Russian-Japanese talks. We have discussed 
bilateral and international problems and agreed to raise the 
level of economic cooperation; to work on, before the visit to 
Moscow by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the draft 
agreement on supporting small and medium business; and to 
continue the talks on strategic stability, he said. We also 
discussed the cases of violations along the Russian border by 
Japanese fishermen and agreed to cooperate in solving the 
problem. 
  For his part, Hata said that Kozyrev had handed over to him 
a 
personal message from Russian President Yeltsin, who invited 
Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa to visit Moscow. The date of 
the visit will be set following the consultations with the 
Russian side, said Hata. 
  Hata spoke in support of the earliest signing of a peace 
treaty. But first we need to settle the territorial problem 
which is impossible without the support of the Russian and 
Japanese peoples, he said. 
  He said that Japan gives its backing to the course of 
reforms 
in Russia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Viktor Chernomyrdin Held Talks with </F>
Japan's Foreign Minister"] 
  [Text] In tackling the territorial question with Japan 
Russia "will act without haste, for this question is not 
resolvable on impulse," Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the 
Russian Federation Government, declared yesterday on the results 
of his talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  He added that the territorial question "was not discussed in 
detail" in the talks. But the premier voiced the hope that this 
question will be resolved sooner or later: "We will, all the 
same, arrive at the conclusion of a peace treaty between our 
countries," and the resolution of the territorial problem is one 
of the preconditions for concluding it. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists that questions of 
developing cooperation in the economic sphere were mainly 
discussed with the Japanese foreign minister. "It is pleasant," 
the premier said, "that the Japanese side is increasing its 
efforts to support our reforms." 
  Replying to a question about the possibility of transforming 
the "seven" leading industrially developed countries into the 
"eight" with the participation of Russia, Tsutomu Hata said 
that, since the G-7 will hold its summit in Naples this summer, 
Italy might play the chief role in resolving this question. In 
general, Russia's joining the G-7 must be examined within the 
framework of precisely this group of countries. The minister 
added that, mindful of Russia's growing influence in 
contemporary international politics, as particularly manifested 
in the resolution of the Bosnian crisis, Japan ought to have 
closer contacts with Russia. 
  Then Tsutomu Hata held talks with Andrey Kozyrev, head of 
the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and met with State Duma 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin. 
  According to Japanese diplomatic sources, the most important 
issue during the visit was to advance a two-way dialogue in 
accordance with the principles enshrined in the "Tokyo 
declaration," which was adopted last October during Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan. 
  In conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent a Japanese 
Foreign Ministry staffer did not rule out the possibility that 
the dialogue between Moscow and Tokyo might be continued at the 
highest level this year.

  [Text] The second stage of the large-scale Japanese 
humanitarian action has begun in the Far East. About 2,000 
tonnes of foodstuffs have been delivered here, including 
vegetable oils and canned meat, dairy, and fruit products which 
will be sold to the population at moderate prices. This 
long-term campaign is being conducted within the framework of an 
intergovernmental memorandum on urgent Japanese humanitarian 
assistance to the Russian Federation. 
  The first stage was carried out during the spring of last 
year. The money raised helped purchase modern medical equipment 
and equip medical institutions. This year it will be used to 
implement the program of social assistance to invalids. It 
should be noted that all stages of the humanitarian action are 
being strictly monitored not only by Russian social protection 
services but by the Japanese side as well. During the 27 
March-4 April period a group of experts from the Japanese 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will carry out a working tour of the 
Far East. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
assistance in the region and to determine the best way of 
rendering it in the future.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Announcer] Head of the Foreign 
Ministry information department Grigoriy Karasin commented on 
the Russian position on this issue for us. 
  [Karasin] We would very much not like to bring the situation 
to a head, or to sanctions. Evidently the necessity has arisen 
to look at the situation attentively and discuss it with our 
partners. In particular the Russian and Japanese foreign 
ministers discussed this issue yesterday. And we have to find a 
quick, effective, and possibly even unusual solution to this 
problem. 
  [Announer] Can Russia, bearing in mind her recent successes 
in foreign policy, become an intermediary in the dialogue 
between Pyongyang and the countries of the West? Here is 
Grigoriy Karasin once again. 
  [Karasin] To be honest, I am not going to lay all my cards 
on 
the table. I just want to say that the appropriate senior 
Foreign Ministry employees have left for Vienna and are taking 
part in the discussions of this problem there. They return to 
Moscow tomorrow. We will take a close look at all possiblities 
and all approaches, and naturally we will act with energy.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Platkovskiy: "Pyongyang Ready for War, </F>
But Moscow Hopes That Kim Il-song Is Bluffing"] 
  [Excerpts] The conflict concerning the DPRK's nuclear 
program has again entered an unpredictable, volatile stage after 
the North Koreans threatened to quit the nuclear weapons 
nonproliferation treaty and "commit Seoul to the flames." But 
all Moscow can do is observe events from the sidelines. 
  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts who have 
returned after verification work at suspect facilities in the 
DPRK were unable to confirm that this secretive country is not 
carrying out work to create its own nuclear weapons. They did 
not manage to get into the radiochemical laboratory, where it is 
suspected that plutonium is possibly being produced for military 
needs. The IAEA Board of Governors will give the final verdict 
and will possibly raise the question of economic sanctions 
against the DPRK for discussion by the UN Security Council. 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, in this situation Moscow prefers to refrain from 
making any statements. At least until the IAEA's final position 
becomes clear. As IZVESTIYA was informed by the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, the situation is not as serious as reports might 
indicate. At any rate, our diplomats still hope that the matter 
will not get as far as a discussion of the sanctions question by 
the Security Council. 
  So far Moscow has remained outside the circle of active 
participants in the conflict because it lacks any opportunities 
to influence the North Koreans' position. Despite the fact that 
the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation between the USSR and 
the DPRK is still in force, just like the article providing for 
military aid in the case of aggression against the DPRK, the 
North Koreans regard this document merely as a scrap of paper. 
  But if the matter does get as far as a discussion of 
sanctions by the Security Council, our experts believe that 
Russian diplomats' main task will be not to back the North 
Koreans into a corner.

  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- Russia's atomic industry 
will be ready to stop the production of weapon-grade plutonium 
by late 1994. A Russo-American agreement to this effect is 
planned to be signed as early as in summer. The arrangement was 
reached during a visit of Russian specialists to the United 
States, Valeriy Bogdan, business manager of the Russian Ministry 
of Atomic Energy, told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  Three reactors producing weapon-grade plutonium continue to 
operate in Russia (one in Krasnoyarsk-26 and two in Tomsk-7). 
But these are dual-purpose reactors. They supply energy and 
heating not only to Krasnoyarsk-26 and Tomsk-7, but also to 
regional centres. The Ministry of Atomic Energy planes to phase 
out these reactors in 1997-1998. Their service life is almost 
completed. District power plants will be built instead. 
  Storages in Russia are now filled to the limit with 
weapon-grade plutonium and with plutonium released from 
dismantled nuclear weapons. There are large plutonium 
stockpiles in Russia and in the United States and there is no 
sense in continuing to manufacture plutonium. 
  However, Russia is now short of funds, and from the 
economical viewpoint it cannot stop plutonium-producing reactors 
and replace them with district power plants. Valeriy Bogdan 
believes it is necessary to reach agreement with the United 
States so that it help resolve the financial problem. The 
United States has stated the intention of helping to get funds, 
without giving guarantees of money, he said.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Gornostayev report under the "Cooperation" rubric: </F>
"Special Conditions for Moscow. NATO's Partnership With Russia 
Will Differ From its Relations With East European Countries"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Yuriy Ushakov, director of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry All-European Cooperation 
Department, has said to your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent 
that as it is going to sign the "Partnership for Peace" plan, 
Russia sees it as a stage on the way to reaching a wide-ranging 
agreement on cooperation with NATO that could be contemplated 
both within the "Partnership for Peace" concept and outside it. 
The program itself is in principle acceptable for Russia at 
this stage as "a compromise that has come about under the 
influence of a number of factors." Moscow does not want to 
approach it from a formal, symbolic point of view that 
characterizes the stances of a number of East European countries 
that confuse a NATO membership card with a credit card to borrow 
money from Western banks. Russia's partnership, however, will 
be different from the cliches of its former Warsaw Pact allies. 
It is essential to take into account its weight on the 
international scene, its status of a nuclear power, and the 
importance of relations between the two partners -- Russia 
itself and NATO. The North Atlantic Alliance, however, is 
preoccupied with the search for a formula that, while formally 
not recognizing Russia's privileged status within "Partnership 
for Peace," would still enable them to foster a special 
cooperation. A number of NATO experts talk about the "16+1" 
formula, which calls for special consultations between the 
Russian Federation and NATO. That is precisely what Russia 
wants. Special conditions will still have to be created for 
Moscow. 
  There is yet another reservation: Many Russian and foreign 
mass media have interpreted Grachev's words as meaning that 
Russia would definitely sign the "Partnership for Peace" in 
March. Officials on Smolenskaya Square [Foreign Ministry] 
clarify: "Maybe in late March, maybe later." The latter is 
more likely. This has been caused by the need to complete the 
drafting of documents, to wind up interdepartmental 
consultations, and to solve a number of technical problems. 
There are two candidates for signing on the Russian side: 
Kozyrev and Grachev. The site of the signing is already known 
-- Brussels.

  [Text] Russia's joining NATO's new program Partnership for 
Peace in the very near future is probably one of the main 
foreign political topics. Gennadiy Ivanov, the chief of the 
Directorate for Military Construction and Reforms, told our 
correspondent Marian Chernukha how this program is being 
assessed at the Russian Defense Ministry: 
  [Begin Ivanov recording] As our president recognized that 
there is a need to join this agreement, we, the military, would 
like to confirm that we are ready to do so, but Russia has its 
own approaches. It does not mean that we should join the 
Partnership for Peace on conditions set to us by NATO. We have 
our own approaches and ideas. They do not run contrary to this 
cooperation, but deepen it. We have difficulties. In 
principle, this idea should be taken into account. We are 
already bringing it into effect. This was confirmed by our 
Foreign Ministry -- the military were never against it -- but 
its forms and methods should be in the interests of both 
European and Russian security. We do not oppose joint 
exercises. We are not against joint symposiums and conferences. 
We do not oppose the bodies that will be affiliated to NATO and 
who could work out decisions jointly. We have already submitted 
a plan -- it is in NATO now -- and we are waiting for a response 
and results. [end recording]

  [Text] Prague March 18 TASS -- The economic forum of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) 
considers European economic problems, paying special attention 
to the difficulties which are faced by the countries 
implementing economic reforms in the transitional period, Pavel 
Smirnov, head of the Department of Economic Cooperation of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, told ITAR-TASS on Friday, after the 
second session of the economic forum concluded here. 
  According to Smirnov, who led the Russian delegation, 
participants in the session focussed mainly on economic 
situation in the countries undergoing economic reforms. 
  The Russian delegates drew attention to regional integrating 
processes with a view to preventing discrimination against the 
Russian Federation. They also raised the question of developing 
production cooperation within the framework of the "Partnership 
for Peace" initiative. 
  We should immediately begin working on the economic aspects 
of the initiative, first of all, in the interests of our 
industry and state military-industrial complex, Smirnov said. 
  The third session of the CSCE economic forum will be held in 
June 1995.

  [Text] Following the disintegration of the USSR, the 
Foreign Ministry of the new, democratic Russia intended to 
establish "good partnership relations with the countries that 
had confronted Moscow during the cold war. This looked as 
though the Russian Foreign Ministry and its head Andrey Kozyrev 
pursued a pro-Western line. This was, however, a policy of 
establishing partnership relations with the West in the context 
of a new balance of forces in the world," Deputy Foreign 
Minister Boris Kolokolov told INTERFAX. 
  He said that "only through direct contacts with our Western 
partners could we prove that Russia was a great power. We had 
to establish partnership relations with those who could pose a 
danger to us." 
  Kolokolov, just back from a European tour, said that he had 
consulted with heads of foreign mnistries in Austria, Slovakia, 
Germany and Switzerland on the Balkan, African and Middle East 
situations. He had also discussed these issues with heads of 
numerous UN agencies in Geneva. 
  Kolokolov said that whoever he had conferred with had 
welcomed the increased Russian activity in the Balkans and the 
Middle East. "This is understandable because in the Yugoslavian 
crisis we are in equally good relations with all the warring 
parties, the Serbs, Croatians and Moslems," Kolokolov said.

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had talks 
Friday with Michel Camdessus, managing director of the 
International Monetary Fund, on making the second part of the 
nearly $1.5 Bn systems credit available to Russia. 
  Chernomyrdin told journalists after the meeting that he was 
pleased with its results and intended to meet Camdessus again 
Friday and Saturday. "Meanwhile the experts will do their bit," 
he said. He added that IMF experts wanted to have a better 
insight into the Russian economy. 
  Valeriy Grishin, first deputy director of the government's 
press service, told INTERFAX that IMF officials were troubled by 
the recent remarks made by the Liberal Democratic Party leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who doubted the indices mentioned in the 
budget draft. Zhirinovskiy accused the cabinet of promising 
unduly high revenues and unduly low spending. 
  Grishin said that Chernomyrdin had asked the IMF delegation 
directly if the IMF was willing to help Russia and added that 
the Russian government did not depend on the Fund's support for 
its success. Grishin recalled that the Russian cabinet had met 
the conditions made by the IMF earlier by holding monthly 
inflation below the 16 to 18 percent mark. According to 
Grishin, the IMF officials had admitted this. Now the IMF 
wanted to verify the budget indices, thus making a new 
condition. Grishin said that the Western experts and their 
Russian colleagues would be given this opportunity. 
  Camdessus will also meet with Russian Economy Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin Friday.
