  [Text] Tbilisi, 24th -- According to the IBERIA news 
agency, speaking at a Georgian Supreme Council session, Zurab 
Murvanidze said that he had received a document proving that 
Georgia was purchasing wheat for 120 U.S. dollars per tonne 
while it could pay 60 U.S. dollars per tonne. In reply, the 
head of state said that it was really possible to purchase a 
tonne of wheat for 60 dollars but credits granted to Georgia by 
the United States and the EU [European Union] obliged Georgia to 
purchase wheat at double the prices only in these countries.

  [Text] Today's sitting of the Georgian parliament was 
remarkable for its poignancy and outbursts of passion. Before 
MPs set to discussing the principal issue on the agenda, that 
is, the approval of the staff of the government, the morning 
sitting was overwhelmed by harsh, radical, and sometimes 
unfounded speeches. Several statements were made. 
  Eventually, at the evening sitting, the parliament got down 
to approving the Cabinet of Ministers. A deputy prime minister, 
Avtandil Margiani, faced the parliament. He made an extensive 
speech about the work done and the future plans. The deputy 
prime minister had to answer numerous questions. 
  Voting was conducted to approve Mr. Avtandil Margiani to the 
post of deputy prime minister. The (?party) of Republicans and 
the Ilia Chavchavadze Society did not take part in voting. They 
had announced their refusal to participate in any voting on the 
approval of members of the Cabinet of Ministers at the previous 
sitting. 
  Some 105 votes were cast for Avtandil Margiani, while 31 
were 
against and five abstained. The nomination of Avtandil Margiani 
has failed. A deputy speaker, Vakhtang Rcheulishvili who 
chaired the sitting, said that the head of state had the right 
to once more nominate his candidate to this post.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 24th -- It became known to the IBERIA news 
agency that Guram Muchaidze has given a statement on behalf of 
the Social Democratic Party: "The other day, Zurab Zhvania, the 
general secretary of the Union of Georgia's Citizens, accused 
the Georgian Cabinet of Ministers of corruption. Eduard 
Shevardnadze, the chairman of the same union and Georgian head 
of state, has presented [to the parliament] for approval the 
same staff of the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  [No opening quotation marks as received] This arouses 
astonishment and concern among us. The head of state should 
either reject the statement made by the general secretary and 
distance himself from it or, provided he shares the viewpoint of 
the latter, withhold the list of candidates. If the head of 
state prefers to keep silent we will infer that he has become a 
Mafia hostage."

  [Text] Today, the parliamentary majority made public a 
statement in connection with certain moves made by some 
opposition parties at the Supreme Council session on 21 March. 
The statement refers to those moves as an effort to aggravate 
the political crisis with a coup d'etat as its final aim. 
  The opposition forces, says the statement, are fighting 
under 
the same formula as they did during the Communist regime, that 
is, "the worse the better." However, if in the struggle against 
the empire this formula contributed to achieving independence, 
today, it threatens the existence of independence. 
  A process of destruction began in Georgia much earlier than 
the present leadership came to power. An unfortunate heritage 
was left to this leadership: War in the Tskhinvali region and in 
Abkhazia, a provoked civil war, an integration of the interest 
of enemies and traitors, a military defeat, a series of 
subversions and sabotage. 
  Despite all the current difficulties, the government has 
been 
trying to bring the country out of the crisis. It has achieved 
a breakthrough in the international isolation. As a result 
Georgia has become an active member of the international 
community and a part of various international political and 
economic structures, established strategically significant 
international relations, restored political and economic links 
with Russia, and other countries. The above-mentioned is, 
actually, only the beginning of bringing the country out of the 
crisis. And the establishment of stability in the country is 
the only condition for the revival of the country's economy. 
  Representatives of the parliamentary majority call against 
the creation of the government crisis, prove their constructive 
attitude toward the confirmation of the Cabinet of Ministers, 
and regard as unacceptable the issue of cardinal changes in the 
government due to the lack of an appropriate basis. 
  Members of the parliamentary majority appeal to the 
opposition parties to reach a consensus, considering efforts to 
discredit the head of state and the Cabinet of Ministers as 
unacceptable in essence, for it could lead to chaos in the 
country.

  [Text] Tbilisi, March 24 (SNARK)--Lately repeated 
opposition charges of the Security Ministry are illegal and 
groundless, told in his exclusive interview to SNARK the 
Georgian Security Minister Igor Giorgadze. "Non-serious is 
demand for us to disclose instantly the crimes in a country 
where population has tens of thousands of arms units at their 
hands, hundreds of tons of explosives, when wild capital 
accumulation and influence-sphere sharing takes place between 
the mafiosi and bandit groups", he said. 
  As told the security minister, certain deputies--throwing 
stones at the government and blaming it as inactive in crime 
prevention--do not take into account the fact that Georgia has 
no legislative basis. Also the special services are not armed 
with necessary equipment to lead the fight with banditry and 
terrorism, thinks Giorgadze. 
  The principal obstacle to efficiency of his institution 
Giorgadze sees in disagreement between the security and defense 
ministries of Georgia. The latter often prevents the actions of 
Security Ministry. He gave an example when a month ago special 
investigation experts were admitted to the place where the 
Defence Deputy Minister Kekelidze was killed only after 12 hours 
after the tragedy.

  [Text] Tallinn, March 24 -- Estonia will make no 
concessions to Russia at the next round of inter-state 
negotiations to be held in Moscow on April 5-6, Foreign Minister 
Juri Luik said in an interview with ETA. 
  "Estonia intends to make no concession at negotiations with 
Russia," Luik said while adding that Estonia's Government has 
been flexible enough by issuing a decree under which retired 
Russian military can apply for residence permits on individual 
basis. 
  On commenting possible agreement on Russian troop 
withdrawal, 
Luik said that "if the agreement comes, it will certainly come 
with different terms than the agreement between Russia and 
Latvia". Russia must consider Estonia's Aliens Law, Citizenship 
Law and property legislation, Luik added. 
  "In Latvian-Russian agreements we considered positive only 
the general agreement on troop withdrawal," Luik said. "We did 
not comment on other agreements," he added. "We do not accept 
pegging troop withdrawal to other issues." 
  Social guarantees of the retired Russian military are 
Russia's problem, Luik said. Now, Russia is also covering 
social expenses of the retired military under a draft being 
negotiated for already two years, Luik said. 
  "Giving residence permits is entirely Estonia's domestic 
matter and we decide whom we will give the permit and whom we 
will not," Luik said.

  [Text] Moscow, Mar 24, BNS -- Russian Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Grigori Karasin, speaking today at a briefing in 
Moscow, claimed the attitude of the Estonian leadership toward 
the Estonian-Russian border issue is shortsighted. 
  The Russian diplomat accused Estonia of "stubbornly clinging 
to a line that is inconsistent with the CSCE principles and 
leads to a dead end, not recognizing the borders shaped in this 
part of Europe as a result of post-war developments." 
  The Estonian Government on March 17 approved and passed for 
consideration in the parliament a bill on borders. The document 
defines the Estonian-Russian border in accordance with the 1920 
Tartu Peace Treaty. The treaty designated as belonging to 
Estonia a number of territories which in 1944-45 passed under 
the jurisdiction of Russia's Leningrad and Pskov regions. 
  Karasin reminded that at last week's hearings in the Russian 
parliament "the arguments of Estonian MP's [member of 
parliament] that Estonia's territorial claims on Russia are 
legitimate were decisively refuted as unconvincing from the 
point of view of international law."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Trouble Brews Along Border"] </F>
  [Text] Fears that Estonian citizens may be vulnerable to 
attacks and persecution along a disputed frontier with Russia in 
the country's southeastern Petseri region have prompted an 
ex-minister to call for their evacuation from the area. 
  The plea was made by Endel Lippmaa, an ex-minister for 
relations with Russia, who argued that Estonia could no longer 
guarantee the safety of citizens residing in the 
Russian-controlled area. 
  In recent weeks, the 2,000-square kilometer Petseri region 
has been the site of several skirmishes between local residents 
and Russian authorities. In one notable incident last month, 
Russian militiamen allegedly entered Estonian territory in 
Varska, in the Petseri county, and accosted a group of local 
villagers. The militiamen reportedly dragged the villagers 
across Russia's "administrative border" and beat them. 
  Mr. Lippmaa proposed making the current administrative 
border 
with Russia an official state demarcation line, a move which, if 
carried through, would effectively cede to Russia territory 
which Estonia has claimed as its own under the terms of the 1920 
Tartu Peace Treaty. The remarks were made in an interview with 
Radio Free Europe on March 2 in which Mr. Lippmaa commented on 
the progress of Estonian-Russian talks. 
  An estimated 6,000 residents out of a total population of 
roughly 50,000 in the Petseri region are believed to be Estonian 
citizens. Many Estonians have accused Russia of encouraging 
ethnic Russians to settle there as a way of reinforcing its 
claims to the area.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 24, BNS -- Population Minister Peeter 
Olesk and special representative of the government in Paldiski 
Juri Tikk in an interview to BNS resolutely contradicted rumors 
that the authorities are making up lists of Paldiski residents 
to be deported. 
  Rumors have lately been circulating in Paldiski that the 
number in the stamp entered in documents during registration of 
the population denotes the order in which people will be 
deported from Estonia. In reality the numbers 1, 2 or 3 in the 
stamp indicate in which of the three registration stations in 
the town a person was registered. 
  Olesk condemned the rumors as "utterly false" and blamed 
them 
on people's inner anxieties or misapprehensions. "The Estonian 
nation has never attempted to deport anyone, while we know very 
well how we were deported more than once," he said. "Since we 
know what deportation means, we never planned anything like that 
for others." 
  Tikk voiced the opinion that the rumors were launched with a 
definite goal in view. "The number in the registration stamp 
has no ulterior meaning," he affirmed. "The documents of the 
Russian military, for example, are marked with a stamp bearing 
number 4. We have no intention of repeating what Russians, 
Germans or whoever did here in their time." 
  On Wednesday [23 March], the second day of population 
registration in Paldiski, 906 people were registered. Tikk told 
BNS there were no incidents, except that some forged documents 
came to light. On Tuesday 689 residents were registered in 
Paldiski. Both Tikk and Olesk told BNS there's no particular 
opposition to registration in the town. 
  "The residents of Paldiski themselves wish to be registered, 
since it will increase their security during the dismantling of 
the nuclear reactors when checks on people staying in the town 
are unavoidable," Olesk said. "The stamps allow people to move 
freely in Paldiski under the special regime." 
  Registration of Paldiski residents ends on March 26.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 24, BNS -- The representatives of 
Russian forces are expected today to present to Estonian 
authorities the lists of Russian military who reside and work in 
Paldiski, Juri Tikk, special representative of the government in 
Paldiski, told BNS. 
  "Estonian military authorities together with Russian 
officials will go over the lists and permit applications and, if 
everything tallies, the documents will be stamped for 
registration," Tikk said. The stamp allows Russian military to 
move freely in Paldiski during the dismantling of the nuclear 
reactors when control over persons staying there will be stepped 
up. 
  Tikk said the command of Russia's 144th motorized rifle 
division and the Baltic Fleet are supposed to present similar 
lists, since some officers serving in those units live in 
Paldiski. 
  At a meeting with Russian officials on Tuesday [22 March] 
the 
two parties agreed that family members of the Russian military 
living in Paldiski as well as their cars will be registered and 
that lists of officers and seamen will be given to Estonian 
authorities. Tikk said about 600 Russian military are currently 
stationed in Paldiski. 
  "We are not entirely satisfied with the compromise, but 
there's no other solution at present," Tikk said. "On the basis 
of the lists we are to get we shall issue the Russian military 
with temporary permits for moving about in Paldiski. We hope 
the lists can be trusted."

  [Text] The Riigikogu today adopted the law on presidency. 
It clarifies the president's duties under special 
circumstances. Illar Hallaste, a member of the Constitutional 
Commission, told ETA [Estonian Telegraph Agency] that the aim of 
the law was to develop the idea of how and under what 
circumstances the president is to fulfill his constitutional 
duties. Most controversial so far has been the clause about 
presidential decrees, should the Riigikogu for some reason find 
it impossible to convene. According to Hallaste, the 
preliminary version of the draft law on presidency contained a 
clause allowing the president to issue decrees in the case of 
state of emergency or state of war. According to the adopted 
law, the president can issue decrees whenever the Riigikogu is 
convened for an extraordinary session but is irresolute, and the 
prime minister has notified the president of this being the case 
of urgent state requirements, Hallaste explained. He hopes that 
this solution is satisfactory to the president as well.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 23, BNS -- All soldiers of combat 
units in the Kalevi infantry battalion are armed with 
Israeli-made Galil rifles, said the commander of the battalion, 
Major Alar Laaneman. 
  Only the battalion's training company still has Chinese-made 
Kalashnikov rifles. The battalion's weapon stock also includes 
Chinese-made grenade launchers. It uses Soviet-made armored 
personnel carriers as combat vehicles. 
  The 400-strong Kalevi detached infantry battalion comprises 
three combat companies, a training company and a service 
company, plus mortar, anti-aircraft and anti-tank batteries. 
  The anti-tank battery is armed with 106-millimeter anti-tank 
guns. Also the mortar unit is adequately armed. But the anti- 
aircraft battery still has no anti-aircraft machine guns despite 
that the battery's commander and soldiers have received the 
necessary training, Laaneman told reporters. 
  The commander of the battalion pointed out shortage of 
officers as one of the causes why the unit still is unable to 
show proper combat readiness, for instance, in gathering by 
alarm. Three military advisers from Finland currently stay with 
the battalion to assist in training the force. 
  The Kalevi battalion was set up on March 18, 1992. On May 22 
the same year the battalion took over from the Soviet forces a 
military college complex at Jagala, some 40 km to the east of 
Tallinn, where it is stationed now. A separate unit, the 
Northern detached infantry company, was set up with the Kalevi 
battalion in the fall of 1993. The company at present is 
stationed in the former Soviet military base town of Paldiski.

  [Text] Riga, 14 Mar -- President Guntis Ulmanis met today 
with representatives of the Latvian Union of National Forces 
[LNSA] to discuss the possible signing of an agreement with 
Russia on troop withdrawal and the future of the Skrunda radar 
station. Actually, after two hours of conversation, both sides 
maintained their original positions regarding the Skrunda 
station. Nevertheless, all participants in the meeting were 
unanimous on the point that G. Ulmanis should meet with Russian 
President B. Yeltsin and emphasize, during their meeting, the 
unwavering position of Latvia. G. Ulmanis promised that during 
his meeting with B. Yeltsin, he will speak about the possibility 
of shortening the term -- four years and 18 months -- of the 
Skrunda agreement, but admitted that he has no hope of a 
positive result, because the term has already been agreed upon 
between the United States and Russia. 
  The president expressed his opinion and his support for the 
compromise achieved by the government on this issue. After 
signing such an agreement, he said, Latvia will at least have 
some international guarantees and supervision from other 
countries, whereas without any agreement, Latvia would have no 
such international support. Naturally, by concluding the 
agreement, the government and the president will assume 
political responsibility and risk, but if the opposite occurs, 
Latvia would make no progress, emphasized the president. 
  G. Ulmanis stated that after signing the agreement, the 
United States will allot $10 million for the dismantling of the 
new building at the Skrunda radar station, and will provide 
assistance in relocating the military personnel to Russia. 
  The view of the Latvian National Independence Movement 
[LNNK] 
was expressed at this meeting by Aristids Lambergs, who stressed 
that Russia should first withdraw its Army by 31 August 1994, 
and only then should the issue of the Skrunda radar station be 
discussed. However, even providing that the agreement with 
Russia is concluded, there are no guarantees that the Army will 
be withdrawn, said Lambergs. 
  In his turn, Latvian Popular Front Chairman Uldis Augstkalns 
said that, first of all, the Latvian Government and parliament 
should officially acknowledge the fact of the 1940 occupation, 
and then appeal for the United Nations to do the same. U. 
Augstkalns emphasized that while considering the Russian troop 
withdrawal, Latvia should rely upon the CSCE document which 
demands immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal, whereas 
signing the agreement with the present conditions would mean 
that Latvia practically abandons all hope of fulfilling these 
documents. 
  Ojars Blumbergs, representative of the "League of Economic 
Activities," represented by LNSA, emphasized that the presidents 
of both countries should take more pains to plan for the 
repatriation of civilians to Russia, because a lot of people 
wish to return to their fatherland. In addition, Russian state 
institutions have shown a well-disposed interest in this 
respect, he said. 
  Several representatives of LNSA expressed the view that by 
signing the agreement on the Skrunda radar station's continued 
operation in Latvia for another four years, Latvia would show 
its willingness to maintain a Russian military base on its 
territory, which would mean that the withdrawal of the Russian 
Army is not complete. The chairman of the Party of Latvian 
Union, Maris Plavnieks, described the Skrunda radar station as a 
Trojan horse which, if it remains in Latvia, will always provide 
the opportunity for provocative actions, both on the part of 
Latvia and Russia. 
  The leader of the "Fatherland and Freedom" faction in the 
Saeima [parliament], Maris Grinblats, stated that the national 
party members have not given up the idea of a referendum on the 
Skrunda issue. Taking into account the fact that the 
Constitution does not provide for referendums on issues 
regarding international agreements, there would be a possibility 
to organize a so-called recommending poll.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 24, BNS -- The Saeima (parliament) 
faction Homeland and Freedom considers that the Latvian 
Government had no rights to authorize a delegation to initial 
agreements with Russia on army withdrawal, the faction head, 
Maris Grinblats, told reporters Wednesday [23 March]. 
  According to the law of Latvia's international agreements, 
accords on foreign armed forces' presence and their status in 
the territory of Latvia can be signed only in the form of 
interstate agreements and only the Saeima has rights to 
determine if they can be signed or not, said Grinblats. 
  The Latvia's law of international agreements is also 
violated 
by initialing the agreement on Skrunda radar station's legal 
status during its further functioning and dismantling, because 
the agreement does not provide for its ratification at the 
Saeima, say the faction members. 
  Grinblats said that it contradicts with the above mentioned 
law and the Cabinet's earlier promises that all agreements, 
drafted during the Latvian-Russian talks, would be handed in to 
the Saeima for ratification. 
  The faction demands that Cabinet respected Latvia's 
legislation and did not sign interstate agreements with Russia. 
The faction also appealed to the government to hand the 
initialled agreements in to the Saeima for taking further 
decisions.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 24, BNS -- The Saeima's (parliament) the 
Latvian National Independence Movement faction considers that 
the agreement on Russian retired military personnel social 
guarantees creates more anxiety than other accords in the 
package of Latvian-Russian initialled agreements, the faction 
head, Aleksandrs Kirsteins, told reporters Wednesday [23 March]. 
  The signing and ratification of this agreement at the Saeima 
would make the passing of a law of foreigners and stateless 
persons status in Latvia more complicated, and it would also 
deteriorate the relations between Latvia and Estonia. In 
Estonia a similar law, being already in effect, delays 
initialling of agreement with Russia on military pensioners' 
social guarantees. 
  After signing an agreement that legalizes occupation army 
officers' residence in Latvia, there will be no use for the 
Saeima to ask NATO member countries' parliaments to acknowledge 
the occupation of Latvia in 1940, said Kirsteins. 
  Kirsteins considers Latvia can sign only those agreements 
with Russia, that do not concern Russian retired military 
personnel social guarantees. 
  The faction also considers that before signing the 
agreement, 
the public opinion must be taken into account as well, because 
nearly a half of the Latvia's inhabitants does not support the 
signing of agreement on Russian retired military personnel 
social guarantees, said Kirsteins. 
  The faction and the Latvian National Independent Movement 
board will discuss March 26 the issue and declare their attitude 
towards the package of agreements, initialled during 
Latvian-Russian interstate talks.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 24, BNS -- The Latvian Democratic Party 
acknowledges the necessity of agreement between Latvia and 
Russia on army withdrawal, but it considers that the 
unacceptable for Latvia regulations in the agreement and its 
supplementary documents must be changed. 
  The party claims the initialled documents correspond with 
Russia's interests to keep possibly large military potential in 
Latvia and sustain people supporting Russia's attempts to make 
Latvia economically dependent from Russia. 
  The party is against granting equal rights both to Latvian 
pensioners and Russian military pensioners and their families, 
and remaining of disbanded army units' officers and their 
families in Latvia. The party also is against Skrunda radar 
station's further functioning in Latvia for five and a half more 
years, without even coming to terms as to the rent payments. 
  The party head, Aivars Kreituss, said Wednesday [23 March] 
at 
a press conference that the rent for Skrunda radar station's 
usage could equal 40 million U.S. dollars a year. Kreituss 
considers Latvia has to determine precisely the radar station's 
created damages to the environment and demand a compensation for 
them from Russia. 
  Kreituss condemned Latvian president Ulmanis decision to 
meet 
with Russian President Yeltsin only in the middle of April. He 
stressed that the above mentioned problems had to be discussed 
immediately to manage the revising of the agreements by May and 
complete the Russian Army withdrawal by the fixed term. 
  The party members consider the publishing of the not yet 
fully coordinated agreements unnecessary, and they condemn the 
Saeima [parliament] faction Homeland and Freedom proposal to 
organize a referendum on this issue, because it is not even 
clear who would organize and finance the referendum. 
  The Democratic Parrty is represented at the Saeima by five 
deputies.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 24, BNS -- Russian army troops stationed 
in Latvia owe Latvia 9 million 865 thousand lats (nearly 17 
million U.S. dollars) for electricity, different taxes and 
services, announced the Latvian Controle Office for Russian army 
withdrawal. The debt for electricity equals 436,556 lats 
(nearly 763,000 U.S. dollars). The office says there are 
nearly 7,000 Russian militaries in Latvia at present, and 190 
army units are stationed in 242 military objects. As many as 36 
of these objects are Russian ships and other floating objects, 
and the number of army cars and trucks equals 827. 
  Besides, there are 360 wagons with munition in Cekule and 
Garkalne ammunition depots. By observing all security measures, 
it is possible to withdraw from Latvia approximately 60 wagons a 
month. 
  The office head, Ilgonis Upmalis, said Wednesday at a press 
conference that the Russian army leadership has disbanded 400 
army units in Latvia without informing the Latvian authorities 
if the disbanded units' officers and their families left Latvia 
or remained here. The same can be said about the Russian 
Northwest Army Unit. 
  Upmalis claimed he had information that the Russian army 
leadership has ordered to disband all army units still stationed 
in the territory of Latvia. Upmalis noted that the Russian 
Northwest Army Unit refused to make known the Russian army 
withdrawal schedule, and, when signing agreement on army 
withdrawal, the schedule would be unilateral and the interests 
of Latvia would be disregarded. 
  The office also announced that Russia officially passed over 
to Latvia several military objects: Alksnis and Birjuzov 
Military school in Riga, Daugavpils Military school, and 
Jekabpils and Lociki airports. As many as 40 Latvian commercial 
structures have bought the former Russian army military objects.

  [Text] Vilnius March 24 TASS -- "Russia links the 
ratification of the agreement granting mutual trade preferences 
which was signed by myself and Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin in Vilnius on November 18, 1993 with our relations 
with the Kaliningrad region," Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius said. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Vilnius on Thursday, 
Slezevicius said that "if previously the administration of the 
Kaliningrad region tolerated Vilnius' efforts to settle 
Lithuania's ties with Russia on a mutually advantageous basis, 
lately it has been trying to press for unilateral concessions 
from Lithuania." 
  "However we believe that we must seek a way out for adopting 
decisions which would be beneficial to both countries," he said. 
Primarily, automobile transportation through Lithuania, 
"simplified" visa procedures for the region's citizens and other 
problems, he added. 
  About four months ago Lithuania sent a note to Moscow, 
requesting to speed up the ratification of the signed package of 
economic agreements. But there has been no reply since then, 
the premier said. 
  He noted that a high-level delegation left for the 
Kaliningrad region on Thursday to seek a "positive solution to 
all questions on the spot, including the construction by the 
Lithuanian side of housing for Russian servicemen returning from 
Lithuania and Estonia."

there is no progress in the affair", Director of special 
projects of Swedish state nuclear inspectorate Jan. H. Nistad 
told ELTA. 
  He confirmed information of ELTA released earlier that the 
assistance to Ignalina plant was suspended unless there is an 
agreement with Belarus preventing claims of the country to 
Swedish companies if a nuclear incident takes place in Ignalina. 
  "The position of Belarus is very undetermined", Nistad said. 
Last November, Swedish Prime Minister appealed in written form 
to his Belarusian counterpart asking to explain the reasons why 
Belarus is not signing Vienna Convention on the civil 
responsibility for nuclear damages and not approving a law on 
nuclear energy. There is no answer so far, Nistad said. 
  Director of Belarusian Institute of Energy problems 
Aleksandr 
Mikhalevich said there were no principal obstacles to sign the 
Vienna Convention or a bilateral agreement with Sweden. But 
"there are no people specialized in nuclear energy neither in 
Belarusian Government nor in Foreign Ministry", he said.

  [Text] Vilnius, March 23, ELTA -- The account of Ignalina 
nuclear power station has been frozen for a month. The wages 
for employees have been paid from the loans received and other 
sources. This happened because of the Lithuanian tax laws 
according to which income taxes were imposed on the production 
which was not sold. 
  "The nuclear power station sells the energy to the state 
energetics system which only now pays for the energy produced 
last year", Director General Viktor Shevaldin said. He also 
noted that the nuclear power station was the object of higher 
risk, thus, it was very irresponsible to do such things. 
However, "strikes and rallies are not our methods", Shevaldin 
said.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told 
journalists on his return from a trip to Warsaw and Brussels 
that he shares the opinion of the Ukrainian defense minister 
about the possible adjustment of the timetable for the 
withdrawal of warheads from Ukraine. In response to a question 
by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency, Zlenko said that "all 
signatories of the statement on nuclear disarmament of Ukraine 
should fulfil their obligations." 
  Earlier this week Ukrainian leaders stated that Ukraine may 
suspend the withdrawal of warheads unless Russia starts 
transportation of nuclear fuel for Ukrainian nuclear power 
stations. 
  "We are entitled to issue a statement and take corresponding 
measures in order to fulfil obligations assumed under the 
trilateral statement," Zlenko said. Asked about the U.S. role 
in the fulfillment of obligations under the statement, Zlenko 
said: "We are talking about equal partnership. Each side should 
assume equal obligations."

  [Text] On Tuesday the U.S. and Ukrainian defense ministers 
held a joint news conference in Kiev. During it, William Perry 
clarified the situation regarding the debt owed to Russia. As a 
result of US failure to pay 60 million dollars due under the 
tripartite agreement, Russia has not been supplying the Ukraine 
with fuel for its nuclear power stations. Perry said this 
problem would be resolved within 10 days of his return home. 
  The announcement by Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy that 
a 
direct communications link would be installed between the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the U.S. Defense Department 
created a sensation. A 17-point working program for cooperation 
has been drafted. The Ukrainian defense minister said the U.S. 
side had shown a commitment to a just solution of the problem of 
the Crimean Peninsula and the Black Sea Fleet.

  [Text] Brussels March 23 TASS -- Ukraine initialed the 
agreement of Partnership and Cooperation with the European Union 
[EU] on Wednesday. 
  The document was signed by Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko and European Commission member Leon Britten. 
The date of the high-level signing of the agreement has yet to 
be determined, but Britten and Zlenko said that it will happen 
soon. Britten said that work is currently underway to prepare 
similar documents with other CIS countries, including Russia. 
  The work on the agreement with Ukraine had taken almost a 
year. It allows Ukraine to eventually join the European Free 
Trade Zone. In 1998 the sides will sum up the results of market 
reforms in Ukraine and decide whether or not they should begin 
talks on its participation in the Free Trade Zone. So far 
Ukraine and the European Union have agreed to grant trade 
preferences to each other, lift the existing quotas and agree on 
terms of trade in coal, steel and radioactive materials. 
Ukraine have also pledged to create favourable conditions for 
Western companies. 
  Both sides stressed the importance of boosting and 
strengthening regional cooperation within the former Soviet 
Union. The preamble of the agreement confirms the EU support 
for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
  The EU Commission will also issue 1.3 million ECU [European 
currency unit] (1.5 million U.S. dollars) to Ukraine in 
humanitarian aid for the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant disaster.

  [Text] In Brussels Ukraine and the Commission of the 
European Union have initialled a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation. At a news conference after the ceremony the 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko called it the fist 
step to carry out the Rome agreement on the possible admission 
of new countries to the European community. 
  In his opinion, in the near future the agreement will 
"guarantee Ukraine political support and economic assistance in 
its efforts to expand democracy and reform the economy on free 
market principles." 
  Ukraine was the first CIS country to initial such a treaty. 
Earlier the three Baltic states became associated members of the 
European Union. Under the initialled document the two sides are 
to carry out a set of measures to integrate Ukraine in the 
community. Talks should begin in 1998 on Ukraine's membership 
in a free trade zone. In the near future agreements will be 
worked out on Ukrainian metal and coal exports to EU countries.

  [Text] Kazan March 19 TASS -- Friendship and cooperation 
for long time to come is the essence of a communique signed by 
delegations from the Crimea and Tataria [Tatarstan] after their 
meetings in Kazan today. This document is the second step in 
the development of relations between the two republics. 
  President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaymiyev signed an 
agreement 
on trade and economic cooperation during his visit to the Crimea 
last summer. Tataria had made commitments to supply oil, oil 
products, petrochemicals, and in exchange, the Crimea -- to 
provide wines, fruits and vegetables, and accommodation in its 
sanatoriums. 
  During the Kazan meetings issues concerning the fulfilment 
of 
the 1993 agreement were discussed, and possibilities of the 
further development of economic, scientific and technical, 
cultural and humanitarian cooperation between state, public, 
national and scientific establishments were spelled out, the 
communique stated. According to the document, bilateral 
relations will be built on principles of equal rights, respect 
for human rights and partnership. It is planned to set up trade 
and economic and cultural centres in Kazan and Simferopol. 
  The political significance of the treaty and a package of 
inter- governmental agreements between the Russian Federation 
and Tataria was noted at the meetings. The two sides emphasised 
that all disputed and knotty issues of state construction must 
be resolved through negotiations. 
  The visit to Tataria by a Crimean delegation headed by 
President Yuriy Meshkov is going on. The Crimeans are 
familiarizing themselves with the capital of Tataria and its 
outskirts.

  [Text] The negotiations between the National Space Agency 
of Ukraine (NSAU) and an official delegation of the U.S. space 
agency (NASA) ended in Kiev Wednesday producing a joint 
declaration. 
  According to the document, the two sides will look into the 
possibilities for cooperation in space research, physics of 
circumterrestrial space, the mutual impact between the sun and 
the earth, space-based scanning of the earth, space biology and 
aeronautics. In part, the declaration proposed using the 
Ukrainian scientific vessels Yuriy Gagarin and Academician 
Korolev. 
  According to NSAU Director General Vladimir Gorbulin, the 
vessels were used to maintain space communications in times when 
the former Soviet Union still existed. "Nowadays they are out 
of service and are a heavy burden for the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry," he pointed out. 
  Gorbulin said the talks failed to touch on the possibility 
of 
bilateral cooperation in producing spacecraft and using space 
transportation systems which is of great importance for Ukraine. 
In his opinion, that was caused by Ukraine's failure in 1992 to 
back the U.S. proposal to expose its missile technologies to 
international control. At the moment, as many as 26 countries 
have signed the agreement.

  [Text] The results of the Crimean referendum will not 
affect relations with Ukraine, said Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov. On the contrary, he said Tuesday [22 March] in an 
interview with foreign journalists in Simferopol, this will help 
transfer relations into a definite channel. 
  Meshkov said that due to irrational economic policies of 
Kiev's leadership our Crimean home is razed to the ground. Our 
task is to build it up and we ask Ukraine not to interfere, he 
said. Meshkov intends to build the Crimean "home" by restoring 
normal economic relations with Russia and establishing mutually 
advantageous relations with Ukraine and other CIS and foreign 
countries. 
  Dual citizenship, said Meshkov, is the bleeding wound that 
causes most people in the Crimea to suffer. He believes the 
problem is caused by the abnormal conditions of the Soviet 
Union's disintegration, the disruption of traditional ties and 
largely bears a moral-political rather than legal character. 
  The Crimean Republic having its own citizenship, with people 
also being allowed to hold a second Ukraine or Russian 
citizenship will lessen the suffering of Crimeans, believes 
Meshkov. The problem of citizenship, he said, is also the 
problem of statehood. That is why it should be solved 
immediately. 
  I do not have negative feelings for the President of Ukraine 
(Leonid Kravchuk--"IF"), said Meshkov. I believe he does not 
feel negatively about me. It is a matter of the incompatibility 
of nationalist sentiments within the Ukrainian leadership and 
the Crimean's aspirations as a consequence of the collapse of 
the economy, said Meshkov.

  [Text] Lvov 24 March, TASS -- If Ukraine does not have its 
own army, it will have no independence either, Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk said. He spoke at a news conference 
after the end of a military training session at the Yavor 
training ground of the Carpathian military district, in which 
the Air Force, artillery pieces and tanks took part. Along with 
the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, military 
attaches of a number of foreign counties watched the shooting 
practice. 
  "The expenditures of 40 billion karbovanets, as calculated 
by 
some journalists, on the military exercise in these difficult 
days are still necessary," Kravchuk said. "If we want today to 
have 150 grammes of pork on our tables instead of 100 grammes, 
tomorrow we shall have no army and, consequently, no 
independence." 
  Problems raised at the news conference included the 
stock-taking at the Black Sea Fleet, the creation of a special 
bilateral commission and the conversion of nuclear armaments in 
Ukraine. 
  The president expressed satisfaction over the decision of 
the 
Central Electoral Commission of the Crimea to hold a social 
opinion poll instead of a referendum, as planned by Yuriy 
Meshkov. "The opinion poll will have no consequences, but will 
cost a lot of money," Kravchuk pointed out. Touching upon the 
forthcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, Kravchuk stressed 
again that he was not going to run for presidency and explained 
it by the absence of a new constitution, laws on the structure 
of the state management system and the status of the president, 
which the outgoing parliament failed to adopt. The Ukrainian 
president hopes that the elections will take place on 27 March, 
otherwise Ukraine will be swept by chaos.

  [Text] [Announcer] A trial specimen of Ukraine's first 
monetary unit -- the hryvna -- has been printed in Kiev. This 
was done during the presentation of a bank note factory. 
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, Acting Prime Minister 
Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, and Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the 
National Bank of Ukraine, took part in the opening ceremony. 
Our correspondent Ihor Kulinichenko reports on this event. 
  [Kulinichenko] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk pushed 
the 
button and the unit started functioning. And here is the first 
product, symbolic product, so to say, coming out [word 
indistinct] -- Ukraine' first monetary unit. 
  [Announcer] During his conversation with journalists Leonid 
Kravchuk emphasized the expediency of issuing [Ukraine's] own 
national monetary unit. 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] The state that has its own money, 
its own currency, is an independent and sovereign state. This 
is why any talk to the effect that we will be independent while 
we have some other currency in our state is a mere deception of 
the people. You do not need to go far, here is the National Bank 
chairman, ask him: Can a state be independent when it has some 
other currency? [passage indistinct] 
  Where is Yukhym Leonidovych Zvyahilskyy? I am here with the 
journalists, and when I say that the country's own currency is 
the attribute of statehood, they tell me that I am a 
nationalist. Maybe, this is because I am from a different 
region. I have already replied to other people, including the 
residents of Moscow. Because, if other another currency 
[circulates in Ukraine], our bank and Viktor Andriyovych will 
become a subsidiary. And the Russian Central Bank is, by the 
way, setting such a condition. And this is normal. One should 
not blame the Russian bank. This is a normal condition. If you 
agree to use the ruble you have to become a subsidiary. 
  And then the deputies, elected by the people, will assemble 
at the Supreme Council and they will have to make decisions on 
[Ukraine's] own money, on credit policy, on taxes. And they 
will be told that this does not [word indistinct] with the 
interests of the Russian National Bank. This is normal. 
  This is why, under these conditions, the people will be 
allowed to elect deputies, but the deputies will not be able to 
make any [word indistinct]. 
  This is why we all here -- myself, the prime minister, the 
National Bank chairman, and all those present, came here so as 
to emphasize that this is an attribute of our independence. And 
any talk to the effect that there can be something else is 
pretense and a deception of the people. I would not like to 
arrest, as they say, attention on this very aspect, but money, 
the financial and banking systems are the [word indistinct] of 
such a sign. When reforms [words indistinct] we are setting up 
Ukraine's own banking system. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Ihor Kulinichenko told you about the 
commissioning of the state bank note factory whose presentation 
was attended by the president of Ukraine and other high-ranking 
government officials and statesmen.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym </F>
Zvyahilskyy by Stanislav Prokopchuk in Kiev; date not given: 
"Yukhym Zvyahilskyy: "You Won't Get Ukraine To Fall Out with 
Russia"] 
  [Text] Some Western media are blowing up the "conflict" 
between Ukraine and Russia. Britain's THE SUNDAY TIMES, for 
example, forecasts not only Ukraine's economic collapse, but a 
war between it and Russia. "If the crisis continues," the 
newspaper writes, "the majority of the Russians in Ukraine will 
choose the path of unification with Russia. This will provoke a 
civil war." TRUD's correspondent asked Ukrainian Acting Prime 
Minister Yukhym Leonidovich Zvyahilskyy to comment on this and 
other similar forecasts. 
  [Zvyahilskyy] These are the ravings of a madman. Clearly, 
some people would very much like our relations to develop 
according to that kind of scenario, but no one is going to get 
us to fall out. Close, equitable ties with Russia were and 
remain our main policy priority. Russia is our biggest economic 
partner. We have historical, cultural, and linguistic 
connections. There are 12 million Russians living in our 
country. 
  Ukraine is a major partner of Russia's. The Ukrainian market 
is equal to one-third of the Russian market. Major lines of 
communication to Europe and the Black Sea area run through our 
country. The economies of the Russian oblasts bordering us are 
the most stable because they maintain direct economic links with 
Ukrainian enterprises, and, you know, tens of millions of people 
live in those oblasts. 
  In short, a strong and stable Ukraine is in the interests of 
Russia and its people. We should always live in peace and 
friendship. But there is no point in adhering to the principle 
that one's own interests are what count and everyone else's must 
fit in with "big brother's." I am sure that's how it will be 
when politics stop dominating economics and commonsense. It can 
be said that we are already en route to that today. We are 
boldly developing bilateral relations and are setting up joint 
ventures. We should eliminate more quickly the problem of 
nonpayments and obtain the opportunity to pay in a normal way 
for the raw materials and commodities of both Russian and our 
own enterprises. Nonpayments is a common ill, and we have to 
cure it together, and not by relying on some benefactor to 
endlessly provide nonrepayable loans. 
  [Prokopchuk] You are thinking of supplies of Russian gas? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] I cannot fault Russia at all here. We 
ourselves are to blame for the temporary halt in gas supplies. 
Russia provides us with 140 million cubic meters of gas a day. 
But there were several days when we were taking 180 million a 
day, thereby reducing the pressure in the export gas pipelines. 
Who is going to put up with that kind of presumptuousness. 
That is why my deputy, V. Landik, flew to Moscow and guaranteed 
Gazprom that we would not allow such outrageous behavior in 
future. 
  [Prokopchuk] Is it true that the Russian joint-stock company 
Gazprom is demanding that the main gas pipelines and the 
underground gas reservoirs be transferred to it to make up the 
arrears? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] That is idle speculation. Different terms 
were proposed: Namely, that a controlling block of shares be 
given to Gazprom during the flotation of the Ukrainian gas 
transportation enterprises and gas refineries. But we will not 
accept that. We propose something else -- flotation with the 
participation of Russian capital. But Ukraine will retain the 
controlling block of shares here. We are now preparing 
documents on yet another issue on which it is time we reached 
agreement. This involves the so-called "zero option" division 
of the former USSR's debts and property. Russia has repeatedly 
asked us to agree this option, saying that no one is to owe 
anyone anything, while the huge amount of former Soviet property 
belongs in its entirety to Russia. We insist that Ukraine has 
its own share of this foreign property. We have agreed to pay 
the appropriate proportion of the former debts to it. We are 
preparing a letter to the Russian Government. 
  [Prokopchuk] Property is a good thing. But you will agree 
that you will have to wait a long time for it to yield a profit, 
while the situation in the country is already explosive. Half 
the population lives below the poverty line and millions are 
unable to buy the necessities of life. Are there any hopes 
today of a better outcome, of stabilization? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] Our predecessors pinned their hopes on foreign 
loans. No one gave us any, and we can see that they are not a 
panacea. Hopes pinned on the possibility of rapid integration 
within the European economy and help from Ukrainians abroad were 
likewise dashed. Our government, headed by the president, 
relies solely on its own devices and possibilities. 
Unfortunately, serious mistakes in both the strategy and 
tactics of reform have been made in the last two years. As a 
result last year alone prices increased 100-fold while wages 
went up 50-fold. In what kind of normal state could you 
increase the return on fuel oil to 5,000 percent while raising 
the payment of bank loans to 320-percent interest per annum? 
  This is not an expose of things done in the past, they 
represent inescapable facts of the present day. 
  [Prokopchuk] The cabinet headed by the president has been in 
office five months. Has it managed to achieve anything? 
  [Zvyahilskiy] Although the economic position in the country 
is difficult, the first signs of stabilization have nevertheless 
already emerged. The inflation rate did not exceed 20 percent 
in January-February, which is 4.5-times less than last December. 
Prices for the most important foodstuffs are not going up. 
Prices for sugar, butter, and vodka are actually going down. 
The rate of exchange of the karbovanets against the Russian 
ruble and the U.S. dolar has stabilized. It has not changed 
since January. 
  I understand the sowing campaign is proceeding normally. We 
have settled our debts with the countryside and the numerous 
enterprises which sent their products to CIS countries last year 
under a clearing agreement. We are abandoning that this year. 
Accounts will be kept only in rubles or freely convertible 
currency. Prices for the next crop of wheat, sugarbeet, and 
sunflower have been fixed, as have prices for petroleum 
products, fertilizers, and plant protection agents. We will be 
granting credits for the sowing and harvesting campaigns solely 
in the form of goods, not money, because monetary credits, 
regardless of control, have vanished God knows where via the 
commercial banks. 
  [Prokopchuk] Credits were surreptitiously converted into 
dollars and landed in foreign banks. Will you be able to get 
the money repatriated? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] Only credits worth 8.6 trillion karbovantsi 
have been returned. Some $30 million for products sold last 
year under state contracts have not been. That is without 
taking account of what disappeared via commercial structures. 
Henceforth, we are introducing flexible currency regulation; we 
want to achieve through this a real correlation of prices for 
basic kinds of foodstuffs here and among our main business 
partners. We intend to determine precisely in terms of kinds of 
produce that proportion of the currency which must be sold to 
the state without fail. A plan to improve tax legislation hass 
been outlined; it will be geared toward the interest of 
manufacturers rather than traders. 
  All these measures should resolve the chief problem -- that 
of ensuring the prompt repatriation of hard-currency export 
earnings. A number of decisions were made recently to that end. 
Under those decisions, all currency will pass solely through 
one state bank. Top managers are trying to torpedo this 
decision, but we are standing firm -- no licences or quotas will 
be issued unless accounts are opened in the Ukreksimbank and 
agreement is obtained for all export-import transactions to be 
serviced by that bank. That will enable us to establish control 
over currency transactions and introduce a system of liability 
for the repayment of credits. I think that if we instil order in 
this sphere we will have the wherewithal to pay for fuel 
supplies from Russia. 
  I should talk, in particular, about our debts for gas. The 
government has instructed the main gas consumers -- the Ministry 
of Industry with its chemical and metallurgical concerns, and 
the Ministry of Machine Building Industry -- to pay for it in 
rubles or freely convertible currency, only on a prepayment 
basis. This arrangement will also be introduced for other 
consumers. The state will pay only for gas intended for 
municipal and domestic needs. 
  Today we are caused many problems by the fact that 
karbovantsi, rubles, and dollars circulate in parallel within 
the country. We think that the state should have only one 
national currency -- the karbovanets. This will above all raise 
its exchange rate to a normal level and block off ways of 
deliberately padding the dollar exchange rate. If we want to 
block off the channel for currency speculation only the National 
Bank and its branches should, in my opinion, buy and sell 
currency. 
  [Prokopchuk] You have set your sights on what is the most 
profitable business for commercial structures.... 
  [Zvyahilskyy] I am under strong pressure for that reason. 
Sometimes government decisions are blocked. We issue someone 
currency, and it takes 15-20 days to reach the recipient. It is 
daylight robbery. We are trying to do something, but there is 
so much to do. I can see that it is time to put a stop to the 
anarchy and total licence for which Ukraine was "famous" in 
1992-93. 
  [Prokopchuk] But the enormous apparatus of the cabinet comes 
under you. 
  [Zvyahilskyy] I do not know what will happen after the 
election of the new parliament, but I am sure that the cabinet 
needs to be restructured. It is clear that there will be 
structural and cadre changes in it. I have been able to see 
during my five months that the apparatus is not overburdened 
with people willing to give their all in the defense of state 
interests. A program has been adopted to make considerable cuts 
in the strength of the administrative-managerial apparatus at 
both central and local level. Incidentally, the first stage in 
the cutting of the Army's strength by 92,000 will also start 
this year. 
  In short, I am sure that these and other measures -- 
privatization and the restructuring of our energy-intensive 
industry -- will clear up the lamentable consequences of the 
"Ukrainianization of the economy" of past years. As far as the 
forecasts of Ukraine's "collapse" are concerned, they will not 
materialize. Our country has huge potential reserves. And we, I 
am sure, like our friendly neighbor, Russia, will be able to tap 
them for the good of our people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Grach, first secretary of the </F>
Republic committee of the Communist Party of Crimea, by S. 
Anenkova; place and date not given: "The Lessons of History Are 
Always Costly"] 
  [Text] [Anenkova] Leonid Ivanovich, you have been 
nominated candidate for deputy of the Supreme Council from the 
Communist Party of Crimea, which you head. The attitude toward 
the Communists among the electorate is, as far as we know, 
ambiguous: from unreserved solidarity to categorical rejection. 
Would it not have been safer, knowing the situation, to have run 
as an independent candidate? 
  [Grach] What have I to hide? Yes, I am one of the few 
politicians who in the period since the putsch has not changed 
colors and who has not betrayed his ideals, for which I have 
endured incredible moral terror unleashed in the news media. 
Many of my former party associates were afraid even to visit me 
in the hospital, for fear of sullying their new, "democratic," 
reputation. More important to me, though, than any portfolios (I 
could have had as many as I wanted) is my reputation as a 
person. It was for this reason necessary to negotiate all the 
anathemas. Life, as the song goes, does not end tomorrow: It 
will sort everything out itself. The people very quickly sensed 
for themselves what life was like under the Communists and the 
sort of troubles they are swallowing under the so-called 
democrats. On the one hand it is unique, on the other, entirely 
natural, that at the time of the presidential elections the 
Communist Party underwent a kind of registration among the 
people and was reborn, considering all the objective and 
subjective realities and fabricated stereotypes of its dismal 
perception--this was a very good result. For this reason, 
today's recognition by thousands upon thousands of nonparty 
people is for me extraordinarily valuable and important. When 
people say that this is not a great number of votes, they sin 
against objectivity: It is sufficient to recall how the entire 
machinery of state--from the Supreme Soviet, Council of 
Ministers, and chairmen of the city and rayon soviets through 
enterprise managers--together with many political forces were 
literally bent on destroying me. No candidate was subjected to 
such pressure as Grach. The party absorbed the first assault in 
my person and after that test acquired, it should be noted, 
moral fortitude and stood up straight on its own two feet. 
  Let us not deceive ourselves and admit honestly that the 
sole 
actual party that we have today is the Communist Party. It alone 
has a scientifically substantiated program of the building of a 
socially just society, experience of state administration, and a 
reserve of skilled managerial personnel, another school for the 
training of those we simply do not have. 
  And, most importantly, our party slate includes 
authoritative, decent, highly professional people. Among these 
are Yu.I. Bogatikov, people's artist of the USSR; A.M. Kalinin, 
admiral and former commander of the Black Sea Fleet; A.M. 
Rasnitsov, hero of the Soviet Union; and many other 
representatives of various professions, cities and rayons, and 
nationalities. 
  [Anenkova] What do you see as the solutions to the impasse, 
and why, in your opinion, have we for so long been wandering 
around in the dark? 
  [Grach] First let us look at the state of prostration in 
which we have found ourselves. We have taken the past away from 
ourselves. We have not created a present. And we are not in a 
position to imagine the future, even in the form of a vision. 
Reform presupposes a change in the system of life and activity 
with the simultaneous reproduction of the actual 
framework-principle of this life. 
  We are today instead experiencing a typical 
pseudo-morphosis, 
that is, a chimera. One of its most important signs is the 
"mystery" of the rules of the so-called "reform," more 
precisely, redistribution, of property, which is being 
undertaken on the sly, under the table. The mechanism of this 
operation is not being made public deliberately in order that it 
might be possible to concentrate all the benefits in the hands 
of the "reformers." According to the laws of the civilized 
world, if it does, indeed, resolve to divide itself into two 
classes--rich and healthy on the one hand and poor and sick on 
the other--three basic conditions are observed. First, national 
principles of the implementation of the reform--the "rules of 
the game" by which the new society shall be built--are 
announced; second, the equality of the "initial" rights of all 
categories of society in this "game," precluding any advantages, 
is recognized; and, third, labor efforts and sharpness of 
intellect ensuring competition are deemed to be the basis for 
stratification. 
  In our situation, however, the powers that be are beyond 
competition: They want to get into both capitalism and paradise 
by pulling strings. Even the socialism-capitalism concepts, 
which are counterposed to one another like unambiguous 
antipodes, have not been conceptualized. 
  Is there a way out of the gapping chasm? I am profoundly 
convinced--such that in my conviction I am like a fanatic, a 
zealous believer--that until we find a solution to the 
socioeconomic impasse, there is no nor will there be any way 
out. Paradise will never be built in Crimea by itself, inasmuch 
as there are laws of systemic order and interdependence which 
exist regardless of the wishes of politicians. I am sure that it 
will not be even six months before everyone is saying the same 
things as myself and that the restoration of a unified state 
based on common borders, customs, financial system, and monetary 
units will ultimately be the inevitable reality. A special 
historical role has been prepared for Crimea, however, in the 
unification process--the motivating factor of integration in an 
economic union with Russia, Ukraine, Belorusia [Belarus], and 
other republics. Such, in brief, are the strategic tasks. 
  [Anenkova] Is it possible to mitigate the fate of the "poor 
and sick," as you put it, in emergency fashion? After all, while 
politicians are seeking their formulas, needy Crimeans are 
literally 
dying. 
  [Grach] Stabilization of Crimeans' living standard within 
the 
framework of today's possibilities is the Communists' paramount 
task. We intend to seek to ensure that the Supreme Council pass 
a law on the creation of a state system of social protection of 
the populace in accordance with the principle of the controlled 
conformity of wages, pensions, and grants to the actual 
subsistence minimum. We will demand of the executive the 
implementation of specific measures aimed at combating 
unemployment and creating new jobs, introducing government 
subsidies fixing the price of bread and milk, and ensuring free 
health care and education, higher included, and the 
accessibility of children's establishments to each family and 
other social safeguards, which must be observed as the holy of 
holies. We feel particularly for the children, who have been 
deprived of the legitimate right of harmonious development: They 
have been thrown out onto the street and into basements and have 
been forced to criminally acquire the wherewithal to live. We 
are duty-bound to defend our women. We are in irredeemable debt 
to our old people, who as gratitude for lives given to the 
state, have been condemned to stand cap in hand at the church 
porch. 
  [Anenkova] On what basis do you plan the restoration of 
Crimea's economy? 
  [Grach] The economic basis should, in our opinion, be a 
multistructured economy with the retention of the leading role 
of public property and state regulation. It is state regulation 
that should ensure the extrication of the national economy from 
the severe economic crisis, and the multistructured economy is 
the way of achieving the social harmony that we so much need on 
the basis of a concurrence of interests of the broadest strata 
of society: from the worker and employee through the 
entrepreneur. For the purpose of stimulation of the producer of 
any form of property (private included), we will seek a 
fundamental change in financial policy in the direction of 
privileged taxation and lending with a simultaneous expansion of 
the tax and investment field, the establishment of government 
subsidies for agriculture, and the removal of the "price 
cutters" in respect to agricultural and industrial products and 
will contribute in every possible way to the development of both 
the kolkhozes and sovkhozes and tenant and private farms. 
  [Anenkova] What is your attitude toward property? 
  [Grach] Only those who are filling their pockets with 
dishonest money may fear the program of the Communists: We will 
conduct a relentless struggle against crime, corruption, and 
profiteering, creating all the conditions for the 
producer-proprietor to thrive. The sole area where private 
property is unacceptable is land, the basic wealth of Crimea, 
which must belong to all the people. Land may be leased, 
indefinitely included, and may be inherited, but may not be 
bought and sold. Otherwise, we would face the threat of becoming 
on our native peninsula not only "emigres" but also colonized 
slaves. There are already such trends on the territory of the 
former Union. 
  [Anenkova] What kind of system of state administration would 
seem optimal to you? 
  [Grach] We are for a broadening of the sovereignty of the 
soviets of all levels--as a guarantor of the strengthening of 
the state status of Crimea, excluding the possibility of the 
establishment of an authoritarian dictatorship. The optimum path 
of the solution of strategic questions of the republic's 
socioeconomic development could be, in our view, consultation 
with the people via referendum. And we are prepared upon 
entering the Supreme Council to offer the people, together with 
the government, a program, if national salvation is what you 
want. 
  [Anenkova] Leonid Ivanovich, have there been in your life 
events, meetings, and achievements that have made a particular 
mark on your memory? 
  [Grach] There have been a multitude of memorable meetings, 
of 
course: As a party official, I preferred to work among people 
and help them resolve their problems--people were always coming 
to my office, and not in vain, probably, confident that they 
would get a sympathetic reception. But there is in the sequence 
of events an achievement of which I am particularly proud: the 
referendum that revived in 1991 from Crimea Oblast the Republic 
of Crimea. 
  Remember the Varfamaleyevka reprisal against the Meskhetian 
Turks and the tent compounds of the Crimean Tatars (refugees) 
pitched in Crimea? We formed a peacemaking delegation at that 
time and set off for the scene of the events in Uzbekistan. The 
tragedy that we saw there was impossible to contemplate with an 
easy heart: ashes in the place of yesterday's dwellings, faces 
contorted by horror and anger.... An Uzbek woman, the secretary 
of the rayon party committee, as I recall, gave shelter in her 
home to 100 terrified casualties and went out to meet the 
infuriated mob. In a yard near Fergana, I picked up from beneath 
my feet a note in a child's handwriting: A young girl had 
written in a letter to her brother in the Army that Papa and 
Mama were working and that all were alive and well and doing 
alright.... The night before, the whole family had been wiped 
out. This incident was, evidently, the last straw, scarring the 
heart and the memory. The lessons of history are always costly. 
And a person who cares more about his own health than about the 
fate of near ones and dear ones and about the fate of the 
motherland is hardly capable or deserving of being called a 
statesman.

<F P=106> [Election platform of the party "Union in Support of the </F>
Republic of Crimea" signed by the Political Council of the 
party: "Opportunities for the Strong, Protection for the Weak"] 
  [Text] The development of society in the interests of all 
strata of the population is the key idea of the program 
documents of the party "Union in Support of the Republic of 
Crimea." The goal of our party is to ensure that man, his rights 
and freedoms, labor and welfare become the real values of the 
society in which we live. To this end, our Republic should 
become an economically strong, democratic, rule-of-law state. 
  The SPRK [Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea] has 
already accomplished, in cooperation with other parties, 
politicians, and representatives of the business communities of 
Ukraine and Russia, a number of specific endeavors that will be 
helpful in solving the economic problems of the Crimea: 
  -- An agreement has been signed with the "Grinev-Kuchma" 
bloc 
and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (Stankevich-Shakhray) 
on establishing permanent informational contacts; cooperation 
between the centrist forces of Ukraine, Russia, and the Crimea 
has thus been actually initiated; 
  -- The holding of a conference of the centrist forces of 
Ukraine, Belorusia [Belarus], and Russia (possibly Moldova) in 
the Crimea in April has been agreed upon with a view to pooling 
our efforts in the advancement of the states toward an economic 
and political union; 
  -- A package of documents containing specific studies of 
ways to overcome an economic crisis and stabilize the economic 
and political situation in the Crimea has been given to the 
president of the Crimea. 
  At present, the party is looking for ways to accomplish 
tasks 
that can overcome the chaos and ruin in the Crimea with the 
participation of economists, lawyers, and social science 
specialists. 
  1. A set of measures to carry out reform of the tax system 
of 
the Republic of Crimea is being developed. The essence of the 
reform is to reduce tax rates at the expense of nontax funds 
being taken in by the budget. 
  This reform will ensure: 
  --An increase in the profits and solvency of existing 
enterprises; 
  --The development of new enterprises; 
  --The creation of new jobs; 
  --An increase in output produced and services rendered; 
  --Greater welfare for the working people. 
  2. A program of measures to restore disrupted economic 
relations through economic cooperation with CIS countries is 
being developed: 
  --The simplification of mutual settlements and customs 
barriers between the Crimea, Ukraine, and Russia; 
  --The creation of local free economic zones with 
subsequent transition to an international free enterprise zone; 
  --The upgrading of Crimean ports and restoration of the 
Crimea- Caucasus railway ferry, with subsequent construction of 
the "Crimea- Russia" bridge; 
  --The creation of an international joint-stock airline 
(the Crimea-Ukraine-Russia) using the facilities of the 
Simferopol Airport and the takeoff and landing potential of the 
military bases in Belbek, Dzhankoy, and Bagerovo; 
  --The creation of joint Crimean-Russian wine-making, 
tobacco- growing, silk-producing, seed-producing, and 
sheep-breeding enterprises. 
  3. The privatization program we propose can stop the process 
of hidden privatization, i.e. the secret pilfering of public 
property, and make this a truly people's privatization. 
  The key stages of the program are: 
  --Adopting the Law on Privatization, which takes into 
account 
the specifics of the region, analyzes the mistakes and crimes 
that have been allowed to occur, and codifies the priority 
status of labor collectives in both industry and agriculture; 
  --Taking a complete inventory with the participation of 
the public, the deputy corps, trade unions, and independent 
experts in order to analyze in detail all changes in the form of 
ownership; 
  --Reinforcing criminal liability for secretly changing the 
form of ownership. 
  4. Our social programs guarantee opportunities for the 
strong 
and protection for the weak: 
  --The preservation of free education and health care, along 
with paid education and health care; 
  --Material support for motherhood and childhood; 
  --A minimum retirement benefit corresponding to the level 
of the subsistence minimum; 
  --Long-term easy credit to young people for the 
construction and acquisition of housing, with a proportion of 
the loan being written off after the birth of each child; 
  --Easy credit to young people to learn a profession or 
retrain. 
  A program for supporting agriculture--the main sector in the 
economy of the Crimea: 
  --The immediate payment of accumulated arrears by the state; 
  --Easy credit to agricultural producers; 
  --The lifting of existing restrictions on the area of land 
grants; 
  --Long-term, indefinite land leases with right of 
inheritance for those who work the land; 
  --Respect for all forms of ownership. 
  In the name of human health and the conservation of unique 
nature in the Crimea, all construction, land, military, and 
economic projects should be carried out in keeping with the Law 
"On Environmental Protection" and should undergo ecological 
reviews. 
  Stage-by-stage demilitarization of the peninsula, with the 
potential of the military-industrial complex being used in the 
interests of the Crimea. 
  The Republic of Crimea must become a symbol of peace and 
welfare. All nations residing in the Republic should have equal 
opportunities to develop their ethnic cultures. 
  Reorganization of law enforcement organs in conjunction with 
their reliable outfitting should become a guarantee of 
protection of the life, dignity, rights, and freedoms of 
citizens of the Crimea. 
  We come out against the reforms that have robbed the people 
and turned a majority of them into beggars. All labor has lost 
prestige, whereas speculation, bribery, and plunder have become 
prestigious. We have created the "Union in Support of the 
Republic of Crimea" in order to bring this outrage to an end and 
prevent the worst from happening. 
  We count on support from all those who create material and 
intellectual assets and who are concerned about the fate of the 
Crimea. 
  Let us help the Republic together!!! 
  [Signed] SPRK Political Council

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Burlakov, chief of </F>
the department for combating terrorism at the Ukrainian Security 
Service Administration, by unidentified UKRAYINA MOLODA 
correspondent; place and date not given: "Terrorism Will Not 
Pass"] 
  [Text] As indicated by its name, the main purpose of the 
Administration for Protection of National Statehood and 
Combating Terrorism and all relevant subunits of local 
governments is to detect and investigate crimes of a terrorist 
nature. This is why the administration and the local "T" units, 
in conjunction with other law enforcement agencies, the 
Ukrainian State Border Committee, and customs services, 
undertake operational actions to prevent illegal imports and the 
spreading of firearms and ammunition on Ukrainian territory. 
They reveal illegal pressuring of state and government 
officials, such as explosion, arson, and other methods, and 
conduct operational searches for authors and disseminators of 
anonymous documents containing evidence of plotting and criminal 
activities, whose investigation rests with the Ukrainian 
Security Service [SBU]. Those subunits are also in charge of 
counterintelligence tasks to counter anti-Ukrainian subversive 
terrorist actions. 
  [Correspondent] How acute is the issue of terrorism in 
Ukraine? 
  [Burlakov] Fortunately, no activities of organizations 
resorting to what is typically considered as a terrorist act in 
their political or religious struggle were reported in Ukraine. 
However, a kindling ground for this is now being cultivated in 
the state, abetted by the flawed legislation and the ever 
increasing legal nihilism on the part of both specific 
individuals and entire public groups. In 1993, 172 cases of 
terrorist threats and attempts on the lives of government 
officials, deputies, and judges were reported, compared to 110 
in 1992. Attempts by criminals and ultraradical individuals to 
acquire firearms, ammunition, and explosives, with which 762 
aggravated crimes were committed, became very frequent. Given 
the danger to society posed by illegal possession of firearms 
and ammunition as well as their possible use in staging 
terrorist acts and other crimes, the SBU and the Interior 
Affairs Ministry [MVS] conducted several joint operations in 
1993 resulting in the seizure of 1351 units of firearms, 
including 79 grenade launchers, 10 machine guns, 111 assault 
guns, 103 rifles, 451 hand pistols, and 2517 grenades -- a 
substantial increase since last year. 
  [Correspondent] Could you give examples of specific cases 
that were successful? 
  [Burlakov] Last year in January, agents from our 
administration, in conjunction with the SBU Chief 
Administration, foiled a conspiracy by one of the Middle East 
terrorist organizations to prepare in Ukraine a terrorist act 
against a foreign embassy based in Moscow. As a result, we 
confiscated grenades and explosives. We also prevented another 
foreign terrorist organization from purchasing in Ukraine 
equipment for conducting terrorist acts in other regions of the 
world. We have some evidence that due to its poorly patroled 
borders and some other factors, international terrorism has 
already "zeroed in" on Ukraine. 
  In late 1992, much attention was attracted by the case of V. 
Yukhno, deputy of the Kherson City Council and head of the 
Ukrainian Democratic Party Kherson-based organizations, who was 
severely beaten by unidentified individuals, and died in the 
hospital on 1 December 1992. Some media and public 
organizations, prior to completion of the investigation, 
classified this tragedy as a terrorist act, accusing government 
institutions, the SBU, and MVS of inaction. Some even went as 
far as to suggest that law enforcement agencies abetted 
perpetrators of that murder. A special commission that included 
experienced agents from the Internal Affairs Administration and 
the Security Service Administration in Kherson Oblast was 
established to investigate the case. As a result of the 
commission's investigation, the culprits were found. They were 
adolescents aged 16 to 17, who had committed more than 10 
assaults and robberies. Two of them were convicted. The 
version claiming political reasons behind that crime, which was 
examined by our employees in great detail, was not borne out by 
the investigation. 
  In September 1993, the Internal Affairs Administration in 
Vinnytsya and Kharkov Oblasts along with the militia detected 
and broke up a criminal group that included residents of the 
above oblasts, as well as residents of the Dniester region. We 
confiscated 1,000 "F-1" grenades, 59 grenade launchers, two 
trotyl cartridges, 32 smoke pots, 100 electric detonators, 10 
signal pistols, and 6 meters of safety fuse -- all stolen some 
time ago from warehouses of the 14th Army of the Russian 
Federation. 
  Last year, we found in Pervomaysk, Dniepropetrovsk Oblast, 
the authors, manufacturers, and distributors -- all local 
residents -- of leaflets containing provocative and threatening 
statements that were sent to the City Council chairman. It 
turned out that they were motivated by personal animosity toward 
the above official. 
  Also established were authors of anonymous letters sent to 
deputies V. Chornovil. O. Moroz, V. Ismalkov, S. Ostroushchenko, 
and others. 
  [Correspondent] What organizations or groups in Ukraine pose 
the greatest threat of terrorism? 
  [Burlakov] Today, such a threat is posed by attempts on the 
part of some ultraradical members of the Ukrainian National Self 
Defense, who do not rule out violence in their struggle for 
power. This organization sends its activists to fight in 
conflict zones (the Dniester region, Georgia). Over the past 
year, four units of firearms, 14 grenades, 10 explosive devices, 
and some 400 cartridges were confiscated from them. One should 
not write off criminal groupings and certain so-called defensive 
formations, used to prepare and carry out terrorist actions and 
other aggravated crimes, as well as emissaries of international 
terrorist organizations. 
  [Correspondent] What obstacles do you encounter in fighting 
terrorism at present? 
  [Burlakov] Of course, difficulties in building a new 
Ukrainian state affect the formation of profoundly different 
organs from the former KGB and other security agencies. Our 
administration, as the SBU as a whole, are in the process of 
organization. This causes problems hindering our antiterrorist 
measures. Cadre is the most important thing. Our 
administration is currently staffed only at 59 percent. Of 
those, two-thirds do not have sufficient operational experience. 
The organization is poorly equipped, especially with computers. 
In addition, current legislation calls for particular 
improvement of Article 58 of the Criminal Code "Attempt at the 
Life of State Officials." We are talking about combating 
terrorism, but the state failed to come up with its concept of 
such a fight. There is no legal definition of what the meaning 
of "terror" or "terrorist acts" in the Criminal Code are. 
  In spite of all those difficulties, we work to overcome them 
and believe in the success of our work.

  [Text] During a telephone conversation Thursday night, 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore expressed their mutual satisfaction with 
the progress achieved by the joint Russian-American commission 
for economic and technological cooperation. They pointed to the 
importance of the recently signed agreement on the conditions of 
Russian uranium exports to the U.S., the exploration of oil and 
gas sites on the continental shelf in Russia's Far East and the 
Russian government's agreement with the International Monetary 
Fund on granting Moscow the second part of the systematic 
reconstruction credit worth $1.5 Bn. [billion] 
  The Russian Government press office said the telephone 
conversation lasted 47 minutes. 
  A press release stated that within the framework of the 
continuing joint work, U.S. secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, the 
chairman of one of the committees of the Russian-American 
commission, will arrive in Moscow next week. During his stay, he 
will be received by Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  Chernomyrdin and Gore agreed to hold the third meeting of 
the 
Russian-American commission for economic and technological 
cooperation in Washington this June.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 Mar -- At a meeting between Sergey 
Filatov, head of the Russian president's administration, and 
Aslambek Akbulatov, Chechen secretary of state, the Chechen side 
broke the preliminary agreement to the effect that recognizing 
the republic as a constituent part of the Russian Federation 
would be a condition for the talks, Filatov told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent today. 
  In addition, according to the head of the presidential 
administration, recognizing the bilateral accord between the 
federal authorities and Tatarstan as a general basis was yet 
another condition for starting talks between Russia and 
Chechnya. Instead, the Chechen side put forward its own version 
of the treaty, Filatov stated. At that point the meeting was 
suspended. The talks can be resumed only if the above 
conditions are accepted, the head of presidential administration 
stressed. 
  Also, Filatov noted that the Chechen side had proposed to 
hold a meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev. The meeting would be premature 
until fundamental issues are solved, he believes.

  [Text] This morning at dawn, Azerbaijani military planes 
dropped cluster bombs on the positions of Nagorno-Karabakh 
defense forces near the village of Goradiz. The SNARK agency 
learned this from the Karabakh army press service. According to 
this report, Azerbaijani soldiers were also affected, because 
bombs of this type have a considerable effect over a wide area. 
  It has also been reported that Karabakh's antiaircraft 
defense troops have prevented Azeri aircraft from delivering an 
air strike on Stepanakert. The information department of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has interpreted this increased 
activity on the part of Baku as an attempt to put pressure on 
the Karabakh side during the consultations on the Karabakh issue 
currently under way in Moscow.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 24th -- Based on information supplied by 
the press center of the Georgian Defense Ministry, IBERIA news 
agency reports that members of a NATO delegation visited the 
Georgian Defense Ministry. The visitors were received by Major 
General Guram Nikolaishvili and Major General Paata Datuashvili, 
the first deputy defense ministers. 
  A frank dialogue took place. Guram Nikolaishvili 
familiarized the visitors with the current situation in the 
Georgian Armed Forces, and said that the establishment of the 
Armed Forces was being carried out in the most difficult 
situation, but the establishment of the Army was an irreversible 
process and the Georgian military would not spare efforts to be 
adequate partners to their foreign colleagues in the task of 
protecting world peace. 
  According to the visitors, they are sympathetic toward 
Georgia, are aware of all problems facing the country on the 
road to independence and its Armed Forces. Members of the NATO 
delegation have familiarized the leadership of the Georgian 
Defense Ministry with a NATO program that has already been 
signed by Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze, and 
which stipulates many aspects of military cooperation. It 
namely stipulates joint exercises and the high level training of 
officers. Appropriate offices are ready for this in Brussels. 
  It has been decided that an agreement on concrete issues 
will 
be worked out in April this year.

<F P=106> ["Immediate release" from the Estonian Ministry of Foreign </F>
Affairs in Tallinn on 24 March] 
  [Text] U.S. "active engagement on behalf of the withdrawal 
of Russian forces from Estonia" is a "high priority" and 
"remains as strong as ever" stated U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher in a letter delivered to Estonian Foreign 
Minister Jueri Luik today by U.S. Ambassador Robert Frasure. 
  In his letter dated March 23, Mr. Christopher notes that he 
has sent messages of congratulations to Foreign Minister 
Andrejevs and Foreign Minister Kozyrev on the successful 
conclusion of troop withdrawal negotiations. "The United States 
considers the Latvian-Russian agreement to be an important 
milestone toward our mutual goal of seeing all Russian forces 
withdrawn from the Baltics, including Estonia, by August 31, 
1994." 
  Mr. Christopher further assures Mr. Luik that the United 
States "will continue to urge the Russian Government to live up 
to its commitment to withdraw its forces." 
  Strong international support for the withdrawal of ex-Soviet 
forces from the Baltics played an important role in Russia's 
decision to continue Estonian-Russian talks April 5-6 in Moscow 
and to abide by the agreed-upon date for withdrawal. Yesterday, 
in Riga, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania called upon "the international community to continue 
its vigilance that this date will be observed."

commandant of Crimea, said in an interview to INTERFAX that this 
document has been adopted without his approval and he intends to 
meet the president in the near future in order to discuss this 
issue. The matter is that the Military Commissariat of Crimea 
comes under the command of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. In 
this connection, Aleksandr Volkov said that he is not going to 
fulfill this instruction and will act in accordance with orders 
from the Ukrainian president. He added that the Spring 
conscription in Crimea will be held in accordance with orders 
that were established earlier.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 24/3/1994 -- The economy of the 
Republic of Moldova showed a slight tendency to redress in 1993 
according to the data in a communique of the State Department 
for Statistics of the Republic of Moldova. 
  The industrial production, expressed in comparable prices, 
increased by 4.2 percent and the agricultural one by 2 percent. 
1992 was the year with the lowest production in the Republic of 
Moldova, reveals the communique. On the other hand, the 
comparative evolution of the industrial output shows a drop in 
1993 on 1992 for 91 of the 120 products on which monthly 
statistical reports are made, most of them consumer goods and 
products for the use of children. 
  "A price hike was reported in 1993," says the communique. 
The consumer price index grew by 25-37 percent in the first 
three months of 1993 and lower increases followed. 
  The communique also speaks about "the worsening of the 
demographic situation -- with a drop in the total population of 
nine thousand persons -- and about a crisis in fields such as 
construction, transport, telecommunications, health-care. 
  As for education, statistical data show an increase in the 
number of pupils who study Romanian, the official language of 
the Republic of Moldova. 
  The foreign trade of the Republic of Moldova started to be 
oriented to a certain extent to the countries of Western Europe 
in 1993, although Russia remained this country's main partner, 
with 35 percent of the total exchanges, followed by Romania, 12 
percent and Ukraine, 10 percent.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan </F>
President, by Chrystia Freeland; place and date not specified] 
  [Text] Kazakhs like to point out, with a combination of 
pride and servility, that Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev their 
president, wears suits without pockets. Mr Nazarbayev has no 
need for pockets: when he wants to smoke, an aide scurries 
forward with a cigarette and a lighter; when it rains, another 
produces an umbrella; and if he sneezes, a third is ready to 
produce a handkerchief. The president, with a complete lack of 
selfconsciousness, has a tendency to begin sentences with the 
phrase "I always tell my Kazakhs..." 
  The strong hand with which Mr Nazarbayev rules Kazakhstan -- 
a country the size of western Europe stretched between Russia 
and China disturbs many western political observers. He sees 
politically authoritarian and economically free-market 
south-east Asia, rather than western Europe, as a model for 
development. Western investors, weary of the anarchy in Russia's 
economic and political life, do not object. They are delighted 
to have found a despot with whom they can do business. 
Kazakhstan has already finalised an oil and a gas deal with two 
consortia of western multinationals. Russia, which has far 
greater oil and gas production, has been much less successful in 
attracting western investment. 
  This contrast gives Mr Nazarbayev the opportunity to observe 
that "whereas Kazakhstan is a unitary state, in Russia all 
political power has collapsed, so perhaps it is harder to do 
business there". 
  He believes that "based on our oil and gas reserves, we can 
say that in the 21st century Kazakhstan will be the world's main 
hydrocarbon producer". The businessmen patiently awaiting an 
audience in the plush lobby of the Hyde Park Hotel during his 
visit to London this week might not go so far, but they tend to 
agree that Kazakhstan is a good commercial prospect. 
  While Mr Nazarbayev dreams of his country becoming a central 
Asian Saudi Arabia -- with a South Korea style government -- he 
knows Kazakhstan must first overcome formidable hurdles. Chief 
among them, as for all the former Soviet republics, is the 
development of a workable relationship with Russia. 
  Kazakhstan is bound to its northern neighbour by ties of 
blood and miles of pipeline. The blood runs in the veins of the 
ethnic Russians, who make up more than 35 per cent of 
Kazakhstan's population. Aware of the potential threat from 
this Russian population, Mr Nazarbayev is careful on questions 
of language and culture: both Russian and Kazakh are the 
official languages of the republic and both Russian and Kazakh 
holidays are officially celebrated. 
  Despite this sensitivity, unrest among the Russians in 
Kazakhstan is growing, and is finding encouragement from some 
quarters in Russia. Russian nationalists -- ranging from Mr 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist leader born in Almaty, the 
Kazakh capital, to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Russian author -- 
believe the north-eastern corner of Kazakhstan, where Russians 
form a majority, should be incorporated into the motherland. 
Some local Russians agree. Mr Zhirinovsky's land claims so 
riled the normally diplomatic Mr Nazarbayev that he described 
him as "a little Hitler". 
  Economic bonds with Russia pose a more immediate problem for 
Mr Nazarbayev. Soviet centralisation means Kazakhstan has no 
oil refineries, and all its pipelines lead into Russia rather 
than to the western markets Mr Nazarbayev is wooing. Over the 
winter, this infrastructure created the paradox of oil-rich 
Kazakhstan shivering in an energy crisis. 
  As a member of Mr Nazarbayev's delegation bitterly put it: 
"We walked over billions of barrels of oil and gas, but we 
nearly froze to death." 
  The shortage was created by the failure of Siberian 
refineries to stick to an agreement to return refined oil to 
Kazakhstan. Through control of the pipelines, Russia is also 
demanding an equity share in the two big ventures Kazakhstan is 
undertaking to exploit its oil and gas fields. 
  "There are certainly some political overtones here," said Mr 
Nazarbayev . "These are our growing pains. We are all just 
beginning to learn to treat one another as fully independent 
states." 
  These overtones, and Kazakhstan's realisation that Russia 
has 
the economic muscle to drive a hard bargain, have provoked an 
important shift in Mr Nazarbayev's relationship with the Kremlin. 
  In contrast with the leaders of more stridently independent 
nations, such as Ukraine or the Baltic states, Mr Nazarbayev 
wanted to preserve the connections between the former Soviet 
republics when the Union disintegrated in 1991. But his dream 
of a partnership between equals has been displaced by the 
reality of Russia's increasingly overt efforts to dominate its 
neighbours; so the Kazakh leader has begun taking a different 
tack. 
  The best example is the rouble zone. Last year, Mr 
Nazarbayev fiercely objected to being forced to drop the rouble 
by Moscow reformers, who argued the impoverished central Asian 
republics were dragging Russia into hyperinflation. Having been 
forced into the cold and survived, Mr Nazarbayev is now scornful 
of proposals by Moscow's new leadership to recreate the rouble 
zone. 
  "Having a common currency now that each republic has its own 
economy, its own budget, its own central bank and its own 
legislature is just wishful thinking," Mr Nazarbayev said. 
"What is happening now is that each state is finding its own 
niche." 
  For Kazakhstan, this entails breaking its dependence on 
Russia's oil and gas infrastructure. Mr Nazarbayev said he 
would reject the Russian bid for equity in Kazakhstan's oil and 
gas fields. But so long as Russia controls the pipelines and 
the refineries, his words may prove empty. 
  That is why he spoke publicly this week about a hitherto 
secret project -- Kazakhstan's plan to build a pipeline from 
Karachaganak, its largest gas field in the north, direct to the 
west via Turkey. "The pipeline through Turkey is a long-term 
project but it is definitely one to which we will give the 
highest priority," Mr Nazarbayev said. 
  The dilemma he and his Kazakhs face is that, bright though 
their prospects may be, today they must rely on Russia. It will 
be years before Kazakhstan reaps the benefits of developing its 
oilfields and building pipelines direct to the west. In the 
meantime, Mr Nazarbayev, the unchallenged ruler of his own land, 
will have to bend in his dealings with Russia.

<F P=106> [Michael Binyon report: "Tajik Leader Seeks West's Help to </F>
Combat Militants"] 
  [Text] It is in the West's interest to help Tajikistan 
stop Islamic fundamentalism spreading north into Central Asia, 
Abdujalil Samadov, the Tajik Prime Minister, said in London at 
the weekend. 
  He called for political and economic support for the former 
Soviet republic on the border of Afghanistan, where Russian 
troops are engaged in regular battles against Tajik 
fundamentalists who fled to Afghanistan after being forced from 
power during a confused civil war. 
  "Tajikistan has always been a crossroads," Mr Samadov said. 
"The West should follow closely what is happening, because all 
the contradictions and challenges of Central Asia after 
Communist rule are concentrated there. Unfortunately the world 
no longer seems to care what is going on in Afghanistan. 
Hundreds of thousands have been killed and the country ruined. 
Doesn't it matter that this shouldn't spread to the whole 
region?" Russian-backed secularists, including many former 
Communists, are now in power in Dushanbe, but political 
stability is not yet assured. 
  In May a referendum will decide whether the country opts for 
a presidential system or gives greater power to parliament. Mr 
Samadov said tension was rising as terrorists and extremists 
were trying to destabilise the country before the election, with 
the help of Afghan fighters. He defended the role of Russian 
troops who, he said, had established firm control over the 
border. "Russia is a force for stability in all Central Asia. 
Tajik-Russian relations are good but they could be even better." 
  In January the country became the first former Soviet 
republic to abandon its shaky currency, the Soviet rouble, and 
switch to new Russian roubles. Its economy is now wholly under 
the control of Russia's central bank, and Tajikistan, ruined by 
three years of bloodshed and anarchy, is once again an outpost 
of Russian influence. 
  Ironically, the pro-Moscow government now has the full 
support of Washington and the West, although the authoritarian 
regime and autocratic tendencies of President Rakhmonov are seen 
as disturbing. The spread of Muslim fundamentalism, backed by 
Afghan Mujahidin, is regarded as the greater danger. Baroness 
Thatcher is among the Western politicians urging strong support 
for the Dushanbe government backed by Western investment. "Her 
political influence is big and her words are authoritative," Mr 
Samadov said appreciatively. 
  Mr Samadov himself knows that only the West, rather than the 
bankrupt Commonwealth of Independent States, can rescue his 
economy. After four days in Britain and a quick trip to Germany, 
he left for America yesterday. In each country he is assuring 
businessmen that their investments would be protected and that 
the government is committed to market reform. 
  The voting in May will be observed by delegations from 
Russia 
and the United Nations. Dushanbe is now trying to woo back 
refugees from Afghanistan, having been warned by Washington that 
the longer they stay in exile the more likely they are to return 
as guerrillas. But fear still grips the valleys, where killings 
during the civil war took up to 100,000 lives.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 03/24/94 -- 
The Azeri formations continue the attempts of breaking the 
Karabakh defense lines in the Fizulinskiy and Agdamskiy 
districts. The most active attacks were commenced in the 
south-eastern direction. 
  According to the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] 
Defense Army Headquarters, the Azeri units in the Fizulinskiy 
district carried out fierce artillery preparations at 6:50am on 
March 23, followed by an extensive offensive in the direction of 
the Karabakh defense positions to the east from the Fizulinskiy 
district center. The Azeri side involved a large quantity of 
armored equipment in the offensive. Meanwhile the enemy 
attacked in the direction of the village of Alkhanly, where the 
Armenian forces captured 4 important heights on March 22. 
Fierce battles were carried out in both directions, causing 
significant manpower losses to the both sides. The details are 
being verified. 
  The battles were still continuing in this direction by 6pm 
in 
the evening. The RMK forces have been repulsing the enemy 
attacks. 
  The Azeri units in the Agdamskiy district commenced an 
offensive in the direction of the villages of Novruzlu, 
Yusifjanly and Marzili later in the evening of March 23. The 
Azeri infantry was supported by 6 tanks and three armored 
infantry carriers. The Karabakh units drove the offensive back, 
causing the enemy significant losses in manpower. The Armenian 
side suffered no deaths, 7 soldiers were wounded. 
  Meanwhile the Azeri Air Force became active again. According 
to the preliminary information, an Azeri fighter jet approached 
the RMK air borders twice, apparently pursuing reconnaissance 
purposes.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Union of Georgian Officers" issued on 14 </F>
March 1994; place not given] 
  [Text] The most serious economic crisis prevailing in the 
country has created great difficulties for the Georgian Army, 
which is in the process of formation. An alarming situation 
exists in army units. It is not possible to satisfy to the 
minimum degree those essential demands of personnel without 
which the tasks facing the country's protectors cannot be 
fulfilled. The training process is, to all intents and 
purposes, in disarray. Combat, weapon, tactical, and other 
types of training are not being conducted at the appropriate 
level. As a result of being socially unprotected, experienced 
cadres are leaving the army. The families of those who have 
died or been made invalids fighting for Georgia's territorial 
integrity have been left to the mercy of fate. Along with 
material deprivation, there is the nihilistic attitude of 
society toward those in military uniform. Moreover, the vile 
disinformation that has recently been spread by certain mass 
media concerning the former defense minister [Giorgi 
Qarqarishvili] is doing great harm not only to the standing of 
the Armed Forces but also to the country's defense capability. 
  Georgian officers have been left with nothing today save the 
honor of their uniforms, and violation of this honor, no matter 
by whom, is bringing grist to the enemy's mill. The Union of 
Georgian Officers, which was created to contribute to the 
process of building the Armed Forces and popularizing the 
military cause, calls upon the Georgian authorities, all strata 
of society, industrialists, businessmen, and representatives of 
the mass media to render effective assistance in forming a 
single strong defense-capable Georgian Army. The Union of 
Georgian Officers calls upon officers and soldiers, in spite of 
all kinds of difficulties, to preserve their spiritual vigor and 
guard their military honor. 
  14 March, 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zurab Zhvania, leader of the "Greens" Party </F>
and general secretary of the Union of Georgia's Citizens, by 
Nino Khidashvili; place and date not given: "The Union of 
Citizens Will Create a New Civic Space"] 
  [Text] The first congress of the Union of Georgia's 
Citizens [UGC] will begin its work today, 18 March. This is a 
political movement that unites hundreds of thousands of 
citizens. A whole number of political organizations have united 
within it. We interviewed UGC General Secretary Zurab Zhvania. 
  [Khidashvili] The union was already created some time ago. 
What report will the UGC general secretary deliver at the 
congress? 
  [Zhvania] It has been three months since the UGC was founded 
in the large hall of the Philharmonic building [Tbilisi]. This 
initial period witnessed the growth of the organization. Our 
union was created on the basis of that charge that existed in 
Georgian society, a charge that was set off with the desire to 
prevent that catastrophe that was really threatening our state 
and society. However, a serious organization would not have been 
able to exist on emotions alone. We can say today that we have 
managed to create solid structures around these emotions, not 
only in Tbilisi but throughout Georgia. I think that 
interesting people have joined the union and a single and 
coordinated nucleus has emerged. Those persons have also 
emerged who will be unable to fit into the mainstream of our 
organization. However, at the same time, people with different 
political experience have united and they now represent a single 
unified organization. 
  [Khidashvili] The union has an organized structure and all 
those qualities or features that are characteristic of a ruling 
party. Does the union have its own ideology? 
  [Zhvania] I would like to emphasize that the UGC is not an 
organization based on a single specific ideology. If we use 
traditional European terminology, we could be called a political 
movement more than a party. This means that our doors are open 
to everyone who wants to cooperate with us. At the same time, 
we have managed to create a solid political nucleus that will 
become even stronger in the future. It is precisely this 
nucleus that ensures the strength and stability of the 
organization. 
  If it is possible to define our ideology in one word, it is 
statehood. Our ideology -- our main aim -- is to create a 
solid, strong state that will ensure the safety and well being 
of each citizen and the prospects for his free development. We 
base ourselves most closely on traditional liberalism, although 
our ideology is broader than this. 
  [Khidashvili] Your opponents assert that the UGC has assumed 
the functions of an executive body. What do you say? 
  [Zhvania] It would be difficult for me to cite an example of 
the UGC fulfilling the functions of an executive body. If our 
opponents mean that active members of the union are trying to 
contribute toward resolving the bread problem and exposing 
sabotage in the power engineering complex, and, in general, are 
trying not to view in a passive manner and joke about the 
destruction of the country but are personally making their small 
contribution to the common cause so that our lives can at least 
be a little better, I do not think this constitutes gross 
interference in the functions of the executive body. This can 
be called more civic responsibility. We are a union of citizens 
and the main concern of our members is civic responsibility 
before society and the state. 
  This probably should not be a subject for discussion. There 
are people who believe that our existence today is something to 
joke about. Others believe it is better today to make one's own 
contribution to improving the situation. However, everything 
will probably be decided by the people. 
  [Khidashvili] The politician Zurab Zhvania hails from the 
"Greens." What qualitative links are there between the "Greens" 
and the UGC? 
  [Zhvania] I remain a Green. However, I must say frankly 
that the situation that has prevailed in Georgia these last two 
years has made it practically impossible to resolve the serious 
economic problems. It is superfluous to speak about preserving 
forests and producing environmentally friendly goods in a 
society where complete chaos reigns and where a person's life 
means nothing. This is precisely the reason why we have united 
with people from other political persuasions: To create a space 
where Greens, Christian- Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, and 
so forth can freely exist. 
  There is today no space in Georgia for civic life. Our union 
will create this space. 
  [Khidashvili] You pointed out at a recent news conference 
that there are many issues in the government's policy with which 
you disagree. What precisely are these issues? 
  [Zhvania] These would make a very long list. It is more 
difficult to list the issues on which we do agree. I personally 
find the existing attitude to economic reform unacceptable. 
  I can state directly that the governing bodies are 
committing 
sabotage; they are disregarding every sensible initiative. 
Moreover, a real war has been declared against private 
structures and private business, which is threatening us with 
catastrophe. 
  I find unacceptable the view that we can do nothing to save 
the coupon and, therefore, we have to enter the ruble zone. 
Both I and our economic experts can see large resources that 
will enable us to strengthen the coupon. It, indeed, cannot 
become a hard currency. However, we believe that it can be 
stabilized on condition, first and foremost, that the problem of 
privatization is resolved and many other issues are quickly 
settled. 
  The main thing that I find unacceptable is the corruption 
that characterizes our government. I firmly believe that the 
time will soon come when all will be made to answer for 
"incorrectly" drawing up contracts for the sale of wheat or 
gasoline, for the "incorrect" distribution of humanitarian aid, 
and so forth. Let no one think that they will be able to hold 
onto the property that they have acquired through [misusing] 
their position. 
  [Khidashvili] Do the UGC and you yourself support the 
reformist Cabinet of Ministers and, in general, the so-called 
"shock therapy" for the economy? 
  [Zhvania] They often joke here in Georgia that this period 
is a shock, never mind any kind of therapies. It is difficult 
not to agree with the public on this score. Our economy really 
is in need of therapy and it would be good if it were to become 
something necessary and not something akin to surgical 
intervention. 
  The main thing is that a united team should enter the 
government, each of whose members will act by proceeding from a 
single position and within the framework of a common program. 
Such a team will not appear before the elections. Therefore, 
our union's position is as follows: The most odious members 
should leave the government prior to the elections and the 
government should become more respectable, although a 
reform-minded team can realistically come to power only after 
the elections. 
  [Khidashvili] Eduard Shevardnadze is the chairman of the 
UGC. Does this factor have symbolic importance or does it 
signify full support for the head of state's policies? 
  [Zhvania] This is not a symbolic factor. I want to 
emphasize that we do not view Eduard Shevardnadze as the head of 
state; he is our political leader, a person who is creating new 
political traditions in Georgia and forming the principles of a 
new moral pragmatic policy. It is from this angle that the 
union's members view Eduard Shevardnadze as a politician. We 
are convinced that he will fulfill a unique role in the history 
of Georgia. 
  [Khidashvili] Will the UGC participate in the future 
elections and how will its program differ from those of the 
other parties? 
  [Zhvania] Of course, it will take part. As for its program, 
it will be formed on the basis of that document that will be 
adopted at our congress. There will probably be serious 
discussions on individual issues in this program. We will adopt 
a basic document on whose basis all other documents will be 
formed, including the election program.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- Russian Minister of 
Economics Aleksandr Shokhin said that "the redistribution of 
duties within the cabinet will take place soon." 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Shokhin said 
that 
on March 23 President Boris Yeltsin appointed him vice-prime 
minister. The appointment fills up the vacancy that existed in 
the government since January 10. There is one first vice-prime 
minister and four vice-prime ministers in the Russian Government 
now. 
  Shokhin expressed the supposition that he may be put in 
charge of economy, finances and cooperation with CIS states and 
international organisations. He added, however, that the exact 
range of issues to be handled by him will be determined at a 
meeting with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin within the next 
few days. 
  Speaking about the draft budget for 1994, Shokhin said that 
the major problem is the "low collectibility of federal taxes." 
He said the government plans to carry out a programme of 
measures to rescind previously adopted laws. He did not 
specify. He stressed that "between the government and the 
parliament normal conditions have been created for a civilised 
discussion of the draft budget." 
  The newly appointed vice-prime minister said that the 
recently imposed import tariffs is a "rather advanced variant 
which had been discussed in the government for six months." It 
is seeking to reconcile the positions of domestic producers and 
consumers. The inflow of goods from abroad has led to the drop 
in demand for domestic products and closure of enterprises. 
Shokhin did not rule out the possibility of establishing, in 
the future, certain privileges for potential western investors 
seeking to invest in the Russian economy, rather than sell 
finished products. 
  Asked about the problem of non-payments between enterprises, 
Shokhin noted that he sees the solution in "tightening payment 
discipline between economic entities and introducing a 
simplified mechanism for solving disputes."

  [Text] Aleksandr Shokhin, who was appointed as vice prime 
minister by a presidential decree while retaining his office of 
economics minister, believes that his appointment is evidence of 
the fact that the position of "pragmatic reformists" in the 
government has strengthened. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow Thursday, Shokhin 
pointed out that his appointment would be followed by a 
reshuffle in the government. His consultations with Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin within the next few days will focus 
on such spheres as economics, finances and external economic 
relations, including those with former Soviet republics. 
  Shokhin added that no one had relieved him of his duties as 
Russia's representative at the International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank and that he would supervise these issues in 
future. He also said that until he was appointed as vice prime 
minister it was the prime minister who directly supervised the 
financial and economic spheres. However, Chernomyrdin had come 
to the conclusion that this was too difficult considering the 
huge number of other problems, he said. 
  Shokhin said that reformists who had left the government, 
such as Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, did not believe that the 
government would convince the IMF to grant Russia the second 
part of the systematic reconstruction credit worth $1.5 Bn. 
Nevertheless, Chernomyrdin had succeeded, Shokhin said. 
  Shokhin pointed out that strict credit and financial 
policies 
consistent with IMF requirements required the annulment or 
suspension of a number of social programs with consent by the 
parliament. The programs, worth a total of Rbs [rubles ] 90 Tn, 
grant privileges and subsidies to enterprises, regions and some 
social groups. 
  Shokhin said that the groups included residents of Russia's 
northernmost areas, servicemen and policemen. He put special 
emphasis on the fact that it was necessary to involve social and 
political mechanisms to smooth the effects of this measure as 
much as possible in the form of a social accord treaty to 
implement the decision.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, nationalities and regional </F>
policy minister, by Tatyana Sukhomlinova under the "Autograph" 
rubric: "Sergey Shakhray: I Will Take Part in Elections, But 
Only as a Voter" -- place, date not given] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray's name is often mentioned among 
those who are expected to run for the Russian Federation 
presidency. According to the Party for Russian Unity and Accord 
[PRES] leader, participating in the elections is not a priority 
for him. As such, he singled out "the creation of a robust, 
effective political party, because without such a system there 
is nothing to be done in politics." 
  [Shakhray] I also see another objective in the next few 
months -- to create an effective staff at the Ministry for 
Nationalities and Regional Policy. So far there has been a lot 
of fuss about it. But we do not have a ministry yet. A minister 
and five deputy ministers have been appointed. It has been 
abolished three times within the past two years. That is all. 
  [Sukhomlinova] Your party has been portraying itself as an 
all-Russian organization that recognizes the principles of 
federalism and local self-government and is oriented toward a 
market economy. But what is the use of it? 
  [Shakhray] Our objective is to set up our representation in 
all echelons of power: from the federal government to the 
Federation components' bodies of economic authority. This will 
take two or three years of work. The PRES already has its 
branches in 66 regions. We have a membership of 22,000 people. 
But there should be allies, a political infrastructure around 
the party. 
  [Sukhomlinova] What is your attitude to your rivals? 
  [Shakhray] The issue is not the word "rival." At present, 
the political picture is dominated by the struggle between three 
political and economic elites: the regional and sectoral ones, 
and that of Moscow. The regional and sectoral elites are now 
joining forces against the Muscovites. But the Moscow group 
itself is divided into four blocs. As far as it is concerned, 
one should not forget that 70 percent of Russia's banking 
capital is concentrated in Moscow... 
  [Sukhomlinova] What four blocs of the Moscow elite are you 
talking about? 
  [Shakhray] If I were to answer your question specifically, 
certain names would have to be mentioned... Everything will be 
clarified in April. Unfortunately.

  [Text] Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy 
Sergey Shakhray says that in the long run Russia will consist of 
15-20 larger regions instead of 89 as now. He was speaking at 
the end of an inter-regional forum in the central Russian city 
of Tambov on Wednesday. 
  The forum was attended by representatives of a number of 
regional associations from central and northwestern Russia, 
Siberia, the Northern Caucuses, Urals and elsewhere. 
  However, such a change will take a long time to happen, 
Shakhray told a meeting of students and lecturers of the Moscow 
Institute for International Relations Thursday. He said Russia 
was "destined for a long interim period during which its current 
structure built along ethnic lines will adapt itself to a new 
pattern based on a territorial principle". 
  Shakhray is skeptical about attempts to try to break Russia 
into provinces either from on-high or below. A lengthy interim 
period is needed because of the huge variety of Russian regions, 
he said. Only 23 out of 89 regions is economically 
self-reliant, others have to be subsidized. As it is now, said 
Shakhray, the federal government is having to act as an agency 
for the redistribution of wealth which creates a highly 
dangerous situation. 
  The minister reiterated support for the recent agreement 
between Moscow and Tatarstan describing it as a first ever test 
of the new method aimed at resolving a power struggle between 
the center and a region. Shakhray believes this will also help 
resolve a similar dispute between Moscow and the southern 
autonomy of Chechnya which appears to be ready for some kind of 
accommodation. 
  Shakhray believes that a lack of coordinated effort by the 
center and political dialogue between North Ossetia and 
Ingushetia are the main stumbling blocks to regional peace. 
  However, he does not believe in any regional settlement 
unless Moscow applies some pressure. Shakhray said the federal 
government must use economic leverage to bring the two sides to 
the negotiating table. He reminded the audience that North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia depended on federal subsidy by 60 and 97 
percent respectively.

  [Text] Today Sergey Tsoy, the head of the press service of 
the Mayor's Office, denied reports that Yuriy Luzhkov, the mayor 
of Moscow, was going to run for a post of president of Russia at 
the upcoming elections for the head of the state in 1996. He 
noted in his interview to INTERFAX that Yuriy Luzhkov has never 
made such statements about his intention to become the president 
of Russia. Sergey Tsoy underlined that the main task of the 
mayor is to work in order to improve the life of Muscovites and 
not to receive any political advantages from his post. He 
believes that rumors that have been spreading around that the 
capital's head of administration allegedly has some political 
ambitions are not only politically irrelevant but also immoral.

<F P=106> [Igor Smirnov report under the general heading "Author of </F>
"Version No. 1 Names Himself. Co-Authors of the Provocation 
Stay in the Shadows": "A Joke of Yesterday's Dissident"] 
  [Text] On Thursday, 24 March, Gleb Pavlovskiy, a 
well-known journalist and editor-in-chief of the VEK XX I MIR 
[The 20th Century and the World] magazine, came to our editorial 
board and said that the theory of the alleged coup, which, upon 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's publication, has been keeping both domestic 
and foreign mass media in suspense for a week already, was his 
"working text," a "routine working fact-sheet -- a compilation 
of open data, including reports of news agencies, primarily 
TASS, POSTFACTUM, and RIA, and also press, radio reports, and so 
forth." 
  Mr. Pavlovskiy told us that "the text was prepared by 
various 
people using a production line method..." It is analytical 
material for official use only, and it found its way into the 
hands of high- ranking officials and to newspaper editorial 
boards without his knowledge. Mr. Pavlovskiy believes that the 
"version" was stolen from his work table or from his computer 
and was distributed by "well-wishers" with whom he is not 
familiar. 
  Having neither the possibility nor any wish to verify the 
authenticity of the details given by Mr. Pavlovskiy, the 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board believes that the theory he 
divulged is scarcely more convincing than the scandalous 
"Version No. 1." Mr. Pavlovskiy tells a lie in calling his 
"working text" "a compilation of open data." The existence of a 
group of coup plotters, their names, and the details of their 
"conspiracy" are a wholesale fabrication of the "version's" 
authors. The way the "facts" were presented is not reminiscent, 
even remotely, of the drafting of a hypothetical theory. What 
kind of theory is it if the names of those who are preparing a 
coup d'etat are written in black and white? It looks much more 
like an anonymous report to the competent bodies. The former 
dissident (and, to our great regret, a member of OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA's editorial board) appears to have forgotten how much 
blood the country had to shed because of such "analytical memos." 
  Presumably, the author of the theory is suffering from 
exaggerated curiosity and was anxious to find out how his words 
would echo. That is to say, he was guided by a pure 
researcher's interest. But so foolish experiments are also too 
dangerous in a country with a bad heredity. 
  It cannot be ruled out, either, that Mr. Pavlovskiy simply 
wished to get embroiled in a scandal: how can one become famous 
without a scandal? This could have been done in a more humane 
way, however. But we do not think it necessary to go into the 
personal plans of the "Version's" author. What's done is done, 
and it stinks. The author's self-esteem may be considered to 
have been flattered, though: his initiative (if it is really 
his, of course) turned out to have many co-authors. After all, 
someone has started distributing "Version No. 2" following 
"Version No. 1." This means that is has come in handy for 
someone. I would dearly love to learn for whom. The 
provocation's co-authors are still hidden in the shadows.

  [Text] Russia's Minister for Nationalities and Regional 
Policies Sergey Shakhray said that the rumors about a 
contemplated coup were extremely dangerous. He told a meeting 
at the Moscow Institute of International Relations that behind 
those rumors was the wish to present the president and his 
people as a nest of vipers and make room for the arrival of new 
people. 
  Shakhray believes that current political life is defined by 
a 
clash between the economic and political elites, above all 
between the Moscow, regional and industrial elites. Moreover, 
the regional and industrial elites seem to have united in the 
struggle against the Moscow elite which, he said, has 
concentrated 702000070040f Russia's capital in Moscow banks. 
  Also, there are clashes between so-called speculative 
bourgeoisie which exports Russian raw materials, and national 
bourgeoisie which concentrates on Russian industry. Both of 
these elites are opposed to one another, which is extremely 
dangerous, too, said Shakhray. 
  He stated that the Party of Russian Unity and Concord was 
among the initiators of the State Duma's resolution on political 
amnesty. 
  He believes that the amnesty prevented a strong clash 
between 
the elites in April and May. Society has been given a breather 
at least until next autumn, said Shakhray. 
  Speaking about the next presidential elections, Shakhray 
said 
that he would not run for presidency.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir </F>
Shumeyko by POSTFACTUM's Lyudmila Sherova under "In the 
Federation Council" rubric; place and date not given: "Vladimir 
Shumeyko: Enough of Shaking the Power"] 
  [Text] [Sherova] Vladimir Filippovich, much is being said 
now to the effect that the next treaty to be concluded after the 
treaty on the delimitation of powers between the federal organs 
of power and Tatarstan will be a treaty with Kaliningrad Oblast. 
From whom has this initiative come? 
  [Shumeyko] The initiative of concluding a treaty between 
Kaliningrad Oblast Administration and the federal government has 
come from the Security Council. It should be pointed out that 
the Potsdam Agreement remains in force in perpetuity. But 
certain politicians are using its 50th anniversary to raise the 
question of the oblast's status; they are starting to say in 
this connection that the Potsdam Agreements are expiring 
inasmuch as the Soviet Union does not exist, Stalin does not 
exist, and Russia is not the Union's legal successor in this 
sphere; and they propose to raise the question of Kaliningrad 
Oblast's once again becoming a protectorate of Germany or being 
regarded as a separate state. Along with this there is also talk 
of the need for a demilitarized zone on the territory of 
Kaliningrad Oblast, of the fact that the presence of troops 
hinders economic development, and so on. Therefore the Security 
Council has decided to sign this treaty. 
  [Sherova] What is it proposed to enshrine in the treaty? 
What changes will there be in relations? 
  [Shumeyko] As we know, the local government can delegate to 
the federal government as many rights and powers as the federal 
government can transfer to the local government. Thus, the 
Security Council reached the conclusion that as many rights as 
possible must be transferred today to the government of 
Kaliningrad Oblast, so that the local authorities can react 
promptly and clearly to any manifestations. For Russia, a quick 
and appropriate response relating to what is going on in that 
region is very important. 
  Therefore we will prepare this treaty very thoroughly. We 
will weigh up what to transfer and what to take on at the 
federal level. 
  [Sherova] The treaty with Tatarstan elicited contradictory 
comments. How valid are the fears of those who believe that 
such treaties shake Russia's unity? 
  [Shumeyko] On the contrary, this strengthens the 
Federation's unity. Tatarstan is right in the middle of the 
Russian Federation and does not have external borders. Many 
people say that it is written in the treaty with Tatarstan that 
Tatarstan is a subject of international law -- which will enable 
it to secede from the Russian Federation. Secede to where? 
Either upward or underground? 
  Moreover, the signing of the treaty with Tatarstan led to 
elections being held there in March. We in the Federation 
Council have acquired two more members. By entering the 
Federation Council, resolving federal problems, and 
participating in the life of the Federation, Tatarstan is 
becoming still more involved in all-Russia problems. I would 
only welcome this treaty. 
  [Sherova] It will soon be three months since the Federation 
Council started its work. How satisfied are you with this work? 
  [Shumeyko] I am satisfied, although many people say: Look, 
so much time has passed, and not one law has been adopted. It 
is not a matter today of the number of legislative acts that the 
Federal Assembly must adopt. It is a matter of quality. We 
must all be aware of one truth: If we regard the question of 
the development of the Russian state as being of paramount 
importance, then we must be very attentive toward the 
legislative base today. On no account must this legislative base 
bear a trace of political struggle. I will cite the following 
example: The chairman of the Federation Council Committee for 
Agrarian Questions is a member of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Just a few months 
ago it would have been unthinkable for a leader of the Communist 
Party to be a committe chairman in a country carrying out 
democratic transformations. 
  The standing orders are very important for any parliament. 
For deputies, standing orders are the paramount law after the 
Constitution. We adopted the standing orders in half a day. I 
must say that the last Supreme Soviet never adopted standing 
orders but worked with temporary standing orders, because, if 
the democrats' faction proposed something, the communists 
rejected it, and if the communists proposed something, the 
democrats rejected it without considering the substance of the 
proposals. 
  [Sherova] What are relations like between the Federation 
Council and the State Duma? 
  [Shumeyko] Normal. Russia is so tired of political troubles 
and so tired of a confrontation that is of no use to anyone that 
we must simply display concerted work. We must now adopt the 
budget and tax legislation as quickly and correctly as possible. 
  [Sherova] Do you believe that the strategy enshrined in the 
president's message and the premier's report is capable of 
rallying the main political forces to resolve the set tasks? 
  [Shumeyko] I believe it is. Because both the Duma and we 
ourselves have responded identically: to discuss in committees, 
to place on the session agenda, and to coordinate the 
president's message with the plan of legislative work. If we 
really link the president's message with the plan of legislative 
work and adopt legislation in development of the president's 
message, then one way or another it will become the rails along 
which everything will travel. 
  [Sherova] Many deputies believe that the message says a 
great deal about what must be done but does not say how to do it. 
  [Shumeyko] Are we to require everything at once of the head 
of state: an interpretation both of what is to be done and how 
to do it? This resembles what things were like in old Rus: The 
nobleman will come along and settle everything. In the modern 
world it is impossible to pile all the work onto one person, 
even if all the analysts work for him. What are the deputies 
for, then? What are the government, the court, the prosecutor's 
office, and all the rest for? 
  The head of state delivered a message which set forth -- in 
my view, for the first time in the whole history of perestroyka 
-- a clear program, and you get the feeling that these are the 
words of a head of state who has acknowledged a number of 
mistakes, named all the sensitive points, and indicated what 
work needs to be done. 
  I myself am a production worker. In production there are 
always two camps which argue and fight each other. There is the 
chief designer and the chief technologist. The designer answers 
the question: What is to be done? The technologist answers the 
question: How is it to be done? The truth is born of this 
dispute. 
  The head of state is the designer and is responsible for the 
question of what is to be done in the state today. The 
technologists are all the rest: the legislators, the 
government, the prosecutor's office, the court, etc. It is they 
who must answer the question of how it is to be done. 
  [Sherova] Do you not think that the emergence of more and 
more new parties will lead to chaos in political life? 
  [Shumeyko] More than 100 parties are now registered at the 
Ministry of Justice. But nothing has come of this. The people 
live as they lived before. Politicians like to show that they 
influence what the masses do. In fact they have almost no 
influence. This can be both good and bad. 
  [Sherova] But are parties created as a tool to seize power? 
  [Shumeyko] If a politician does not think of seizing power, 
he is simply not a politician. But an interesting situation, in 
my view, has taken shape in Russia today. The question of 
seizing power has become secondary and disappeared from the 
agenda. This is something that politicians will never 
understand. The question of strengthening power stands in first 
place. All the powers that exist will be strengthened when the 
Russian state is strong. 
  Today it is customary to personify power, which is why 
people 
associate presidential power with Yeltsin. I respect him, but 
some people do not like him. Those who do not like him say that 
presidential power is bad because Yeltsin stands up there. 
They, these politicians, must understand that if they do not 
find within themselves today the strength to reinforce this same 
presidential power and only then fight to become president, then 
nothing good will happen in Russia. But they are now shaking 
this power which they subsequently want to seize. Enough of 
shaking it, it is time to strengthen it.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunayskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 24 Mar -- Sudden depressurization of the 
pilots' cockpit may have caused the crash of the A-310 airbus in 
Kemerovo oblast. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this today 
by Valeriy Eksuzyan, general director of Russian International 
Airlines, which operated the airliner. 
  Using information gathered from the site of the disaster 
investigation, he pointed out that this scenario is supported by 
the facts. The investigation has established that the airbus 
descended from a height of 10,000 m with its engine running at 
an angle of 70-80 degrees for 10-20 minutes with its navigation 
lights on and undercarriage retracted. It fell after grazing a 
hill. The area over which the pieces of the aircraft are 
scattered is small - 200 meters. The fuselage, cockpit, wings, 
and other pieces are close together. The three pilots were 
found in the Airbus's cockpit, strapped to their seats. Their 
bodies, like 46 bodies of the other people on board, were quite 
recognizable. 
  According to Valeriy Eksuzyan, these facts indicate that, as 
a result of some abnormal phenomena, the pilot's cockpit may 
have been suddenly depressurized, which, at an altitude of 10km, 
causes the blood to boil and death ensues quickly, and the 
aircraft, uncontrolled and on autopilot, lost height until the 
moment of impact. 
  However, it will be possible to determine the precise cause 
of the disaster, according to Valeriy Eksuzyan, only after the 
two "black boxes", the flight recorders, which were recovered 
today and were sent to Moscow for study, have been decoded.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "What the Dumping of Toxic Substance </F>
Threatens?"] 
  [Text] The railcars containing industrial waste from 
France, the Netherlands, and Israel which have been halted for 
almost 50 days in the Orenburg area have "won" worldwide 
notoriety. The international environmental organization 
Greenpeace has drawn attention to the trainload of harmful, 
toxic substances and demanded that France remove the dangerous 
consignment from Russia. 
  What is the nub of the issue here? "The train comprising 16 
cars carrying waste products arrived in Orsk for reprocessing at 
the Yuzhuralnikel combine, but the waste products turned out to 
contain high levels of harmful substances such as cadmium (up to 
15 percent), thallium (2-3 percent), and arsenic. The train was 
sent further into the steppe -- to the Buruktal combine, in 
Svetlinskiy Rayon. We do not have the techniques for detecting 
these toxic substances," Chief State Inspector Viktor Blinov, 
first deputy chairman of Orenburg Oblast's Environment 
Committee, said. 
  It is impossible to send the train back, as we have no 
address, he stressed, explaining: "As soon as the cargo crossed 
the border at St. Petersburg the consignor relinquished all 
responsibility. The customhouse at Astovo station let the train 
in. It clearly should be called to account. And it is strange 
that the certificate of quality for the raw materials was a week 
late in coming, by which time the train was already in Buruktal." 
  Viktor Blinov is worried: With the onset of spring the 
likelihood of the cadmium, thallium, and arsenic "escaping from 
the sacks into the environment" increases. He considers that 
"each sack must be placed in a separate metal container. This 
constitutes a lot of labor-intensive work requiring not just 
caution but also huge amounts of money." 
  Svetlinskiy Rayon administration chief Vasiliy Yeremenko has 
"evicted" the train from his territory. It has been moved in 
the direction of Orsk. The wagons are now halted in a railroad 
siding.

and Gratitude"] 
  [Text] To the participants in the International 
Scientific-Practical Conference dedicated to the 40th 
anniversary of the start of the opening up of virgin lands and 
fallow lands and to all participants in the virgin lands project 
  I wholeheartedly congratulate you, dear friends, on this 
noteworthy date in the history of the peoples of Russia and all 
the CIS countries -- the 40th anniversary of the start of the 
opening up of the virgin and fallow lands. 
  The rapid opening up and development of vast, bleak, 
previously unpopulated territories in Siberia, the Volga region, 
the Urals, Kazakhstan, and other parts of the country 
constituted a magnificent occurence in the life of our country 
and our people. In the difficult postwar conditions the country 
was embarking on the solution of the tremendous problem of 
ensuring reliable self-sufficiency in food, and first and 
foremost in grain. 
  Around 2 million young people responded to the call to open 
up the virgin lands. Through their persistent work and with the 
whole country's help a new grain-producing region was created. 
The practical experience of opening up the virgin lands and the 
fallow lands provides convincing evidence that, if people pool 
their efforts, success is guaranteed even in the most difficult 
task. That experience is especially valuable in the present, 
complex time. The CIS countries can overcome the crisis and 
resolve their complex problems quickly only if they act together 
in close collaboration and cooperation in all spheres. 
  I pay deep respect and gratitude to all who contributed to 
opening up the virgin and fallow lands, who devoted the best 
years of their lives to that cause, and who made great efforts 
to create prosperity for our people. 
  I wish you, dear comrades, good health, happiness, and new 
successes. 
  [signed] B. Yeltsin.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golovenko report: "Barannikov Still Silent"] </F>
  [Text] While almost all the recent Lefortovo and 
Matrosskaya Tishina prisoners have given interviews following 
their release, Viktor Barannikov has been avoiding all contacts 
with the press. Perhaps this is why the all-knowing and 
all-understanding democratic press has not informed its readers 
of a fact which could, if people were so inclined, be called 
sensational. Namely, that the Russian Federation General 
Prosecutor's Office has not applied the amnesty to the former 
security minister. He is still under investigation. 
  I telephoned defense attorney D. Shteynberg yesterday: 
  "Viktor Pavlovich and I visited Gaydanov, the new chief of 
the investigations administration, and he informed us of the 
reason for what I would term this lawlessness." 
  It turns out that the Prosecutor's Office is waiting for the 
State Duma to adopt a decree on the procedure for applying the 
amnesty. This may be required for some people, but as far as 
the political prisoners are concerned, the Duma has already made 
everything perfectly clear -- the amnesty is to be applied 
forthwith! I believe that the Prosecutor's Office is 
maliciously violating the constitutional principle that all are 
equal before the law. 
  Of course, the exception made for V. Barannikov could be 
considered an annoying misunderstanding. It could be claimed 
that, in the course of the struggle which A. Kazannik waged 
against the presidential entourage, striving to release A. 
Rutskoy, R. Khasbulatov, and their associates as quickly as 
possible, he forgot about the man in the hospital. But that 
explanation is one for dimwits. There is another, more likely, 
theory. 
  The "collective Rasputin" with which, we recall, the former 
security minister finally quarreled on the eve of his 
resignation has forgotten nothing and has not forgiven him. It 
is as if they are hinting to the recent inmate of Lefortovo, 
from where he was transferred to the hospital after a heart 
attack, that, even though now "at liberty," he is still wholly 
in the hands of "their man" -- A. Ilyushenko -- a direct 
presidential appointee. And this is why conclusions must be 
drawn. 
  Needless to say, it is no secret that Viktor Pavlovich knows 
a very great deal about the "secrets of the Kremlin court." For 
instance, which dollar incomes are used to educate the sons of 
certain highly placed grandees in prestigious foreign colleges, 
which of them have accounts in what bank, or which of them are 
involved in corruption or the trade in natural resources. He 
could also talk about why one of those close to the court -- a 
fervent opponent of the CPSU -- is nicknamed "Tanya." 
  Naturally, the amnesty will eventually be applied to V. 
Barannikov. But the pointed playing on the sick man's nerves 
points to the invisible deal that they are trying to foist on 
him. Something along the lines of "you keep quiet and we'll set 
you free."

<F P=106> ["Theses for elaborating the Communist Party of the Russian </F>
Federation Program" adopted "as a basis" by Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee Plenum 15 
March 1994: "From Crisis to Stable Development, People's Power, 
and Socialism"] 
  [Text] I. The Present State of Russia. A Brief 
Description 
  The present state of Russia may be defined as general crisis 
enveloping the main spheres of social life -- statehood and the 
economy, politics and culture, everyday life and morality. 
  The "free" market has divided society. A tiny minority is 
becoming fabulously rich out of plundering national wealth. 
While the huge majority whose labor created that wealth is 
reduced to poverty. The swift division is breeding a civil 
split and social strife. Ruthless exploitation of working 
people and the embezzlement of natural resources are taking 
place in Russia. The people have been deprived of fundamental 
socioeconomic and political rights. Economic crime has become 
the basis for all other types of crime. The criminalization of 
society is threatening personal and public safety. The class of 
a new bourgeoisie, primarily a comprador bourgeoisie, is being 
purposefully and swiftly formed through the destruction of the 
social sphere and the Russian state. 
  Since the forcible elimination of the soviets in 
September-October 1993 an authoritarian regime -- a regime of 
personal presidential power -- has been established in Russia. 
In effect what has been established is dictatorship by capital, 
which is merging with the criminal world. The corrupt state 
apparatus is serving the interests of mafia clans, which control 
much of the country's economy. The people are debarred from 
management and from monitoring state power. 
  The confrontation between the ruling regime and the huge 
majority of the population is deepening with every passing day. 
There is a ripening understanding among the masses that the 
general crisis enveloping Russia is the consequence of the 
breakdown of the socialist system and the deliberate destruction 
of a unified and powerful state -- the USSR. 
  The Soviet Union was the victim of betrayal by the ruling 
elite which had seized the leading posts in the CPSU and of the 
actions of national-separatists, who aligned themselves with the 
most aggressive forces of international capital, which is 
seeking a new repartition of the world. 
  The perestroyka of socialism announced by the bureaucratic 
CPSU elite turned out to be an adventure without precedent in 
the history of manipulations of mass consciousness. The 
so-called "new thinking" and demagoguery about "pan-human 
values" eroded ideas about working people's genuine interests 
and about the country's national, state interests. This was 
aided by the "radical democrats," who secured the adoption of 
declarations of the sovereignty of Russia and other republics 
and ratification of the Belovezhskaya agreements, which ignore 
the results of the referendum on preserving the USSR. The 
destruction of the Soviet Union created a threat of the 
disintegration of Russia, exacerbated national relations 
everywhere, and resulted in fratricidal civil wars. A great 
power was thrown onto the margins of world politics. It is 
increasingly becoming a raw materials appendage, a market for 
low-grade goods, and a source of cheap skilled manpower. 
  The crisis that has erupted in Russia is taking place in 
conditions of a world crisis. The West is seeking to escape it 
at the expense of our country. The weakening of Russia is to 
the advantage of the strategists of the new world order. 
  The threat of economic, political, and spiritual enslavement 
hangs over a great multinational community of people linked by a 
common historical destiny. 
<H5>  II. The Lessons of History and the Way Out of the Crisis </H5>
  At the start of the 20th century the exacerbation of 
inter-imperialist contradictions led to our country's 
involvement in World War I contrary to its national-state 
interests. The October Socialist Revolution extricated Russia 
from that war. 
  Great October was a breakthrough to the future -- to 
socialism. History demonstrated that the turn onto the path of 
socialist development ensured the sovereignty of the working 
people, the qualitative renewal of the centuries-old Russian 
statehood, and the salvation of Russia as a great power. 
  After tremendous sacrifices caused by World War I and the 
civil war, the party elaborated a program for stable development 
-- it took the road of the New Economic Policy. The NEP 
prevented a fresh outbreak of civil war and ensured the 
necessary conditions for the next stages of state development: 
electrification and industrialization of the national economy, 
broad socialization of the means of production in city and 
countryside, and cultural revolution. 
  This policy underwent serious changes as a result of the 
external threat hanging over the USSR. The mobilization economy 
and the swift development of education, science, and technology 
enabled the country to create the necessary potential for 
defense from military danger. This subsequently ensured 
restoration of the war-ravaged economy within the shortest 
possible time. Social ownership and the people's selfless, 
heroic labor saved the country. Despite the distortions and the 
violations of democracy and legality, the people's masses 
retained and strengthened their belief in socialism. 
  At the same time the mobilization economy, which had 
demonstrated its effectiveness during the war and the 
restoration of the national economy, began to lag behind the 
demands of the scientific and technical revolution that had 
begun in the world. Without democratization and improvements in 
the management system, without the use of flexible and adaptable 
forms of economic activity, it became a brake on the development 
of many spheres of social life. 
  Society needed new ideas and stimulation of the creative and 
production activeness of individuals and labor collectives. 
However, the reforms launched for these purposes did not produce 
the expected result. Everything was stifled by the opposition 
of the party bureaucracy, the unpreparedness of cadres, and the 
inertia of mass consciousness. 
  Socialism's economic potential was not realized in 
conditions 
of the world technological and information revolution. The 
pursuit of wealth by any means, careerism, corruption, 
irresponsibility, and incompetence were not properly assessed in 
society. Private capitalist tendencies emerged in society. The 
exploited section of working people began to lose faith in the 
justice of the existing system, which devalued socialist and 
communist ideals in the eyes of millions. The crisis enveloping 
Soviet society stemmed to a considerable extent from the crisis 
in the CPSU, which had been the ruling party for many decades. 
Its theoretical activity and methods of managing the economy 
and the state as a whole were in particular need of renewal. 
  The "communist arrogance" of the leaders, who had come to 
believe that their position was unshakable, plunged the CPSU 
into the state of a "conceited party," which in turn 
foreshadowed its defeat. The inequality between the party 
"leadership" and the "grassroots" emerged increasingly clearly; 
the careerists became increasingly deeply isolated from the 
millions of Communists and from the working people. The CPSU 
was transformed from a mass party into an apparatus party. 
  The upshot of this was primarily that the CPSU, assuming 
responsibility for all spheres of social development, was unable 
to find solutions to pressing problems. The gap between word 
and deed, between program promises and the fulfillment of those 
promises, became increasingly marked. 
  The errors and miscalculations made by the CPSU in the 
process of socialist building were presented in a distorted form 
by the mass media, which were in the hands of renegades and 
pseudo-democrats. 
  The consciousness of the working people's masses was 
thoroughly muddied by a powerful stream of denigration of Soviet 
history. Along with ideological and psychological indoctrination 
of the masses, a section of the working class was suborned for 
use in the political struggle against the Communists and Soviet 
power. As a result the majority of the working population 
remained indifferent to the dramatic fate of the CPSU and the 
soviets. 
  The so-called "Gorbachev perestroyka," which was ostensibly 
aimed at renewing socialism, deepening democracy, and overcoming 
the distortions and abuses, was in fact a deviation from 
socialism. The equality of all forms of ownership was 
proclaimed and the role of the most viable form -- social 
ownership -- was undermined in every way, and the essence and 
forms of the cooperative movement were distorted. This gave a 
free hand to shady capital and other antisocialist and 
antipeople forces opposed to the gains of October, Soviet power, 
and the unified union state. 
  During this period the conditions were created for a 
transition to a monopoly of private ownership and for the fusion 
of the new bourgeoisie and corrupt functionaries. Yeltsin's 
"reforms," the liberalization of prices, and the predatory 
privatization struck a crushing blow to the country's economy 
and caused chaos and disarray, total impoverishment of the 
people, and a slide by society toward national catastrophe. The 
political formalization of these actions was the August events 
of 1991, October 1993, and the finagling through of a 
constitution of private ownership and presidential autocracy via 
a referendum supported by a minority of voters. 
  The country can and must emerge from the crisis. How can 
this be done? This is impossible, first, without stopping the 
capitalization and colonization of the country, and, second, 
without turning toward socialism. The CPRF [Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation] sees three political stages in 
consistently resolving these tasks: a general democratic stage, 
people's power; the transition to socialism along with the 
restoration of the power of the soviets, working people's power; 
socialist development proper. 
  During the first stage Communists in alliance with the 
progressive patriotic movement seek the formation of a 
government of the people's trust. This is called upon to 
eliminate the catastrophic consequences of the "reforms" and to 
stop the slump in production. Here it is necessary to return to 
the population the illegally appropriated (privatized) property 
and to involve working people in control over production and the 
distribution of national wealth. During this stage the mixed 
economy foisted on society is retained. The government and 
representative organs of power ensure security and the country's 
independence from the colonial policy of the makers of the "new 
world order" and promote integration processes among the former 
USSR republics. 
  During the second stage, after relative stability has been 
attained, working people increasingly participate in the 
management of the state via soviets, strike committees, and 
other social organs of people's power brought forth by life. A 
transition to transformations based on the dominance of the 
socialist mode and the consistent economic elimination of 
private ownership begins. 
  The third stage of social transformations is the development 
of a socialist society on the basis of post-industrial and 
information technologies while utilizing the best domestic and 
world achievements of science and culture. 
  We see the new socialism as a society stimulating the 
individual's creative activeness and working people's 
self-management. At the same time the foundations are laid for 
the future -- a communist association in which the free 
development of each will be the condition of the free 
development of all. 
<H5>  III. The Minimum Program </H5>
  During the first stage, proceeding from tactical aims, the 
CPRF deems it necessary to implement a number of priority 
measures and presents these in a minimum program. 
  Using vigorous activity in the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly and all accepted methods of extraparliamentary 
struggle, the CPRF will seek: 
  In politics 
  -- the formation of a government of people's trust 
accountable to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly; 
  -- nationwide discussion of a new constitution and its 
adoption by a real majority of voters; 
  -- the adoption of a new electoral law; 
  -- the restoration of the Soviet form of people's power; 
  -- national accord on the basis of a renaissance of the 
age-old friendship of the peoples; 
  -- the restoration of the union state by constitutional 
means and on a voluntary basis, beginning with denunciation of 
the Belovezhskaya agreements; 
  -- the implementation of an independent foreign policy 
according with the country's national-state interests and its 
security, even including the abrogation of international 
treaties and agreements damaging Russia's interests and dignity. 
  In the economy 
  -- a change in economic course, the abandonment of "shock 
therapy," and the implementation of measures of state regulation 
with a view to ending the slump in production and combating 
inflation and unemployment; 
  -- the reform of tax policy with a view to stimulating 
investment in domestic production; 
  -- state regulation of the sale of military output on the 
world market; 
  -- the elaboration of targeted programs of state support 
for producers for specific sectors of the national economy 
(primarily science-driven, high-technology production 
facilities); 
  -- state support for highly productive and efficient farms 
in the agro-industrial complex irrespective of their forms of 
organization and ownership; 
  -- state investments in modern production facilities for 
the processing of agricultural output; 
  -- the priority right of commodity producers (kolkhozes, 
sovkhozes, joint-stock companies, farmers) to acquire 
controlling blocks of shares during the flotation of enterprises 
in the food and processing sectors of industry; 
  -- the establishment of control by the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly over the expenditure of money on major projects 
in order to prevent departmentalism and parochialism in forming 
the expenditure side of the state budget; 
  -- the elaboration of a state program to extricate the 
country from the environmental crisis; 
  -- the creation of state, regional programs to ensure 
employment; the definition of a package of measures to eliminate 
unemployment. 
  In the social sphere 
  -- the restitution to Russia's citizens of guaranteed 
socioeconomic rights: to labor, rest, housing, free education 
and medical services, and a secure old age; 
  -- the formulation and signing by the supreme organs of 
state power and the trade unions of an agreement on ensuring a 
realistic subsistence minimum for working people; 
  -- guarantees of the preservation of working people's 
property; 
  -- state support for the family, mothers, and children, 
the restoration of the destroyed network of preschool and young 
people's cultural, recuperative, and sports institutions, 
support for the disabled and pensioners, and the introduction of 
state grants for underprivileged families; 
  -- the priority safeguarding by the state of the 
development of science, education, and culture at a higher 
standard than that of advanced countries, as used to be the case 
even during the difficult postwar years; 
  -- the creation of state-guaranteed normal conditions for 
the life of servicemen and their families and the safeguarding 
of dignified living conditions for retired servicemen, first and 
foremost job availability; 
  -- the restoration of state centers for youth training and 
employment. 
  In the protection of the people's personal and public 
safety and spiritual health 
  The CPRF advocates the peaceful development of revolution 
but 
will not be indifferent to violence against the working people 
or the flouting of human and civil rights. It has supported and 
will support civil resistance and disobedience toward illegality 
and tyranny, utilizing all forms of nonviolent resistance. It 
will seek: 
  -- the restoration, through the mediums of public education 
and enlightenment and the mass media, of the prestige of honest, 
voluntary labor and a creative attitude to things in general, to 
the traditions of community and Russian collectivism, and to the 
Russian language and the culture of the peoples of Russia, which 
are the basis and medium for spiritual inter-ethnic 
communication and mutual enrichment; 
  -- an end to the policy of implanting westernism and 
Americanism, historical vandalism, and the cult of profit, 
violence, and depravity; 
  -- the prohibition of the propagation of ideological 
revanchism and political vengeance; 
  -- an end to the denigration of Soviet history and the 
memory and teaching of V.I. Lenin; 
  -- the suppression of crime and the toughening of punitive 
measures against people engaged in the theft of property, 
corruption, speculation, banditry, and the selling off of the 
country's natural and intellectual resources; 
  -- the adoption of laws to intensify the struggle against 
organized crime, to protect witnesses and judges, and to provide 
social guarantees for law-enforcment agency staffers. 
<H3>  IV. The CPRF Is a Party of State Patriotism and Social 
Justice </H3>
  The CPRF is a party of the working people. Its traces its 
lineage through the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, the 
Russian Social Democratic Workers Party (Bolsheviks), the 
Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the All-Union Communist 
Party (Bolsheviks), the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and 
the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist 
Republic. The CPRF takes on board everything of value from the 
past experience of the Russian and world communist movement, 
which is enabling it to take shape as a self-renewing party of 
working people seeking to provide answers to the most acute 
problems currently arising for society. 
  In the current specific historical conditions the CPRF 
utilizes nonviolent methods for changing social life and opposes 
developments which could lead to civil war. The fatherland will 
be saved by an effective alliance of progressive state-patriotic 
forces. 
  The CPRF expresses and defends the interests of hired labor, 
the overwhelming majority of whom are industrial and 
agricultural workers. The program being formulated by the party 
is intended to become a document for working people to determine 
the direction of their life so they can say, as during Lenin's 
time: "Here we have our comrades, our brothers, here we have 
our common cause." 
  The strengthening of the alliance of workers, peasants, and 
the intelligentsia and the solidarity of working people of all 
nationalities is not history but an insistent requirement of the 
present day. 
  The working class will fulfill its historic mission if it is 
aware of the vital need for society to emerge on the path of 
socialist development. If it heads up a people-wide, nationwide 
movement for Russia's independence and integrity and for the 
restoration of the union state. It is the CPRF's duty to give 
it every assistance here. 
  The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the destruction 
of 
the state and economic foundations of the Russian Federation 
have led primarily to social vulnerability for working people. 
The establishment in the country of the omnipotence of mafia 
comprador capital, for whom the motherland is a commodity, has 
also hit the interests of the small stratum of patriotically 
minded private property owners and civil servants. 
  In present-day conditions the CPRF defines state patriotism 
as the ideal of a Great Russia, the ideal of restoring a Soviet 
union state and acquiring reliable allies beyond its borders. 
  The CPRF considers that the strengthening of the nationwide 
patriotic ideal is only demonstrated when it is combined with 
the socialist ideal. 
<H3>  V. The CPRF Is a Party Advocating an Alliance of Communist 
Parties and Unity of Action by All Communists </H3>
  The CPRF is an independent party which has defined its path 
to the future as the path of the nonviolent transition of 
society to a socialist condition. 
  The CPRF considers that the communist parties active in the 
former union republics are independent political organizations. 
The CPRF advocates an equal and strong alliance among them and 
regards this as an essential precondition for the restoration of 
the union state. 
  The CPRF advocates cooperation among the communist parties 
active in the Russian Federation on condition of their 
recognition of the restoration of the union state on a voluntary 
basis; the restoration of the Soviet state system; the 
inadmissibility of political extremism in any form; 
noninterference in intraparty affairs and inadmissibility of 
abuse against one another; and unity of action in fulfilling the 
commitments assumed by each side. The CPRF does not permit 
double membership -- the presence in its ranks of members of 
another party with its own program and statutes. 
  The CPRF is a party of creative Marxism and progressive 
social thinking and advocates the constant exchange of ideas and 
experience. 
  The CPRF sets the following as priority tasks for its 
activity inside and outside the party:" 
  -- the organizational strengthening of the party, starting 
with its foundation -- primary party organizations; 
  -- the ensuring of party discipline on the basis of 
equality and moral relations among party members; 
  -- the giving of moral and material assistance to the 
older generation of the CPRF -- CPSU veterans; 
  -- the expansion of the reserve of party activists and 
activist party supporters; 
  -- participation in elections to organs of supreme and 
local power and organs of local self-government; 
  -- maximum utilization of the party's factions in the 
Federal Assembly and local organs of power and self-government 
to protect the interests of hired labor; 
  -- the ensuring of a CPRF presence in all spheres of 
social life; 
  -- the maximum utilization of legal forms of work in labor 
collectives; 
  -- the conducting of actions in defense of rights to 
support the just demands of labor collectives and all working 
people; 
  -- the implementation of measures of social assistance to 
deprived people; 
  -- the defense of civil and human rights when they are 
violated in the Russian Federation and nearby and distant 
foreign countries; 
  --the scientific and ethical protection of the 
fatherland's history and its Soviet period; 
  -- participation in various forms of nationwide people's 
patriotic movements for the restoration of the friendship of the 
peoples and the union state. 
  The CPRF retains the red color of its banner and the symbol 
of working people's unity -- the hammer and sickle. 
  The CPRF's slogan is: "Russia, labor, people's power, 
socialism." 
  The theses were adopted as a basis at a CPRF Central 
Executive Committee plenum on 15 March 1994. The text was 
finalized taking account of proposals received from the 
commission approved by the plenum with the following membership: 
Comrades Belov, Zorkaltsev, Zyuganov, Kosolapov, Kuptsov, 
Lukyanov, Melnikov, Osadchiy, Slavin, Tsiku, and Shabanov.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- The decline in Russian 
production for 1994 will amount to 12 per cent, and consumer 
prices will rise by five times, according to the Russian 
Government's social and economic forecasts for 1994, discussed 
by the government presidium on Thursday. The report is intended 
to be sent to the State Duma as an accompaniment to the draft 
federal budget. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin, the main speaker at today's meeting, 
reported that the Economics Ministry had prepared four main 
types of forecasts. The first forecast is called 
inertial-adaptational, implying the virtual continuation of the 
present state of the economy. 
  The second envisages strict monetary policy, characterized 
by 
the activation of market mechanisms, the lowering of inflation, 
and the continuation of the sharp decline in production. 
  The third forecasts active fundamental restructuring, which 
presupposes the creation of a foundation for the implementation 
of basic economic restructuring, with inflation higher than it 
is at present, and with less financial balance. 
  Shokin considers the fourth alternative the best. It 
supposes a policy of active economic stabilisation, accompanied 
by moderately strict monetary policy and designed for a 
two-front fight against inflation, by limiting state 
expenditures and by selective stimulation of production. 
  The advantages of the fourth alternative stem from the 
state's limited financial resources for implementing qualitative 
structural reforms this year. It is, in effect, based on 
selective support for highly-effective state enterprises, on the 
financing of quick-return investment projects, and also on 
widening the sources of financing for the social sphere, 
especially concerning housing. 
  According to the government's fourth forecast, Russia's 
gross 
national product (GNP) might fall by eight per cent, and 
industrial production might decline by 12 per cent. Overall 
agricultural produce would fall by seven per cent, production of 
energy resources, by four per cent. This variant forecasts a 
five to six per cent unemployment rate, which translates to 
about three million unemployed russians. The average growth of 
consumer prices would be 12 to 13 per cent a month, falling to 7 
to 9 per cent monthly by the end of 1994. 
  According to this prognosis, out of a 745 trillion rouble 
gnp, 3.9 per cent would be spent on state investments, three 
percent on state subsidies, 1.6 per cent on state expenditure on 
science and research, and five per cent of the GNP would be 
devoted to defense expenditures. 
  Shokhin announced that the government's forecast for 1994 
under a policy of active economic stabilisation was fairly 
optimistic and oriented towards resolving the main problems of 
economic reforms and getting the maximum use out of reform's 
advantages as soon as possible. Therefore, he concluded, such a 
task would be difficult, but completely realistic.

<F P=106> [Igor Petrov report: "The Budget Is Creaking, but Not </F>
Breaking. Implementation of the Federal Budget in the First 
Quarter of 1994 Analyzed"] 
  [Text] The Russian Government has analyzed the conduct of 
the budget policy in the first quarter of this year and sent a 
note on the matter to the State Duma. This document notes in 
particular that state expenditure was funded mainly from tax 
revenue to the tune of 8.5 trillion rubles [R] and Central Bank 
credits to cover the deficit totaling R7.5 trillion. The issue 
of state securities provided the budget with R1.1 trillion. 
Another R1.6 trillion was collected from additional sources. 
  As of 15 March, R13.1 trillion out of the R17.6 trillion 
expected during the first quarter had been allocated from the 
federal budget to fund expenditure. 
  A priority sphere of state policy in the sphere of 
expenditure was the funding of measures ensuring the social 
protection of the population, and also giving support to 
individual sectors of the national economy. According to 
preliminary data, in the first quarter industry received R909 
billion; R969 billion went into state investments; R1,109 
billion into social and cultural measures; R3,627 billion into 
defense; and R1,077 billion into the law enforcement organs. 
Territorial budgets received considerable support -- R2,080 
billion. 
  Moreover government experts note that the 1994 budget is 
being implemented in the face of continuing negative trends in 
the economy: The decline in production is continuing, and 
reciprocal unpaid debts are increasing. For these reasons, tax 
payers are delaying the transfer of funds into the federal 
budget. During January-February, payments to the tune of R4.7 
trillion came into the treasury. In March the total will not 
exceed R3.3 trillion. 
  The extreme strain on the budget can in many respects be 
attributed to the poor financial discipline displayed not only 
by enterprises but also by certain Federation components. Thus, 
in January 1994 Bashkiria's [Bashkortostan's] arrears to the 
treasury were R52 billion, Tataria's [Tatarstan's] -- R37 
billion, and Yakutia's -- R32 billion. Apart from that, over 
R20 billion of income from foreign economic activity was paid 
into territorial budgets, whereas these funds should have been 
paid into the federal budget in their entirety. 
  According to the Finance Ministry specialists, the 
implementation of the budget in the first quarter can be called 
more or less stable. Neither the government nor the State Duma 
adopted decisions which might "blow up" the expenditure entries. 
This enabled the financiers not to go beyond the limits of the 
credit emission established by presidential edict back in 1993. 
At the same time, admittedly, it must be borne in mind that 
despite the promise given by the head of the Cabinet to settle 
accounts fully with the peasants and defense industry workers in 
terms of last year's debts (R4.6 trillion), it did not prove 
possible to do so. 
  Millions of Russians have experienced for themselves the 
results of the moderately tough credit-monetary policy and the 
government's fairly successful maneuvers between the threats and 
demands of sectoral and regional lobbyists -- primarily through 
the reduction in the rate of inflation. As compared with 
January, the increase in prices in February-March fell to a 
record low of 9.9 percent. For the first time the increase in 
wages, which reached 10 percent in February, overtook inflation. 
  The Finance Ministry experts call the relative regulation of 
the funding of the social sphere a second achievement. This 
should be understood to include the prompt payment of wages to 
people whose work is funded from the budget, a growth in social 
allowances for children and invalids, and support for 
institutions of higher education. It is noted in addition that 
the majority of expenditure on the social sphere is borne by 
local budgets, whose state is far from the optimum. The 
discrepancy between the local and federal income and expenditure 
entries in budgets is often the reason for "failures" in 
funding, which causes people rightful dissatisfaction.

<H5>  Foreign Economic Activity </H5>
  Foreign economic ties with distant foreign 
countries. In January-February 1994 Russia's foreign trade 
turnover (excluding CIS countries) totaled $8.1 billion, down 
7.2 percent at current prices on January-February 1993. 
  Russian exports totaled $5.5 billion, a rise of 1.2 percent, 
including $3.1 billion to industrially developed countries (up 
0.4 percent), $0.8 billion to developing countries (up 8.6 
percent), and $1.6 billion to other countries (former CEMA 
countries, China, DPRK, republics of former Yugoslavia, Baltic 
republics), down 0.4 percent on January-February 1993. 
  Exports of oil totaled 11.5 million tonnes in 
January-February 1994 (99 percent of the same period last year); 
natural gas -- 21.8 billion cubic meters (122 percent); 
petroleum products -- 3.6 million tonnes (115 percent), coal -- 
2.2 million 7onnes (117 percent), iron ore -- 1.5 million tonnes 
(266 percent), mineral fertilizers -- 2.0 million tonnes (138 
percent), round timber -- 957,000 cubic meters (82 percent), 
cast iron -- 307,000 tonnes (158 percent. Exports of machinery 
and equipment totaled $228 million, down 36 percent. 
  Average export prices of virtually all basic exports 
dropped: 
oil and petroleum products, gas, nitrogenous and potash 
fertilizers, pulp and paper, nonferrous metals (down 10-30 
percent). Prices of coal, ammonia, lumber, and cast iron rose 
5-15 percent. 
  In January-February 1994 Russian imports totaled $2.6 
billion, down 21 percent on January-February last year, 
including $1.5 billion from industrially developed countries 
(down 9 percent), $0.4 billion from developing countries (down 
43 percent), and $0.7 billion from other countries (down 24 
percent compared with January-February 1993). 
  In this period 7,000 tonnes of quick-frozen meat were 
imported (54 percent down on January-February 1993), along with 
10,700 tonnes of citrus fruits (down 69 percent), 642,000 tonnes 
of grain (down 58 percent), 45,000 tonnes of raw sugar (down 84 
percent), $37 million worth of knitwear (down 40 percent), $82 
million worth of fabric clothing (down 46 percent), 895,000 
pairs of leather footwear (down 85 percent), and $55 million 
worth of medicines (last year's level). Imports of machinery 
and equipment totaled $829 million, a rise of 4 percent. They 
accounted for 32 percent of all imports. 
  Russia had a foreign trade surplus of $2.9 billion in 
January-February 1994 ($2.1 billion in January-February 1993). 
  On the money markets the ruble-dollar rate of exchange 
continued to fall in February. At the beginning of the month 
the rate was 1,560 rubles to the dollar, but by the end of the 
month the figure has risen to 1,659. The situation was 
determined by steady inflationary expectations, the main factor 
in the fall in the ruble rate 
  Exports of primary fuel resources to nearby foreign 
countries. The following amounts of the most important 
categories of fuel were exported to nearby foreign countries in 
January-February this year:

total exports of these commodities to CIS countries).

  [Text] Moscow/Murmansk March 24 TASS -- Two Russian nuclear 
submarines of the Northern Fleet collided on Wednesday in the 
Barents Sea while practicing correlated maneuvering. The press 
service of the Russian Navy qualified the incident as "a 
contact" of two U-boats. 
  Nobody was injured, the armaments and equipment of the 
submarines are in due order and the radioactive situation is 
normal, the press service said on Thursday, adding that the subs 
returned to their base independently. 
  It was earlier reported that the "contact" resulted in 
"inconsiderable damage" which poses no danger to either the 
personnel or the environment. A source in the Northern Fleet 
headquarters told TASS that both subs were submerged when one of 
them, on her way to the surface, "touched" the other sub. The 
source described the damage as "minor", adding that both vessels 
were returning to the base without surfacing.

  [Text] A statement by the administration of the Primorye 
region that next week it may take an independent decision on 
release of liquid radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan seems 
to be based on "mercantile interests," a high-ranking diplomat 
in the Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax on Thursday. 
  "Accusing Moscow of forgetting the problem of the use of 
liquid radioactive waste, the Primorye administration is seeking 
to put psychological pressure on the Japanese and to get the 
money from them as soon as possible," the diplomat said. 
  He said the statement was not a surprise for the Russian 
Foreign Ministry. "The Primorye administration had made it 
clear even before that it wants on its own to be able to handle 
the money which the Japanese agreed to provide for the 
construction of the liquid nuclear waste deposits and 
reprocessing facilities," the diplomat said. 
  He noted particularly that negotiations with the Japanese on 
the construction of nuclear waste deposits and facilities for 
its reprocessing are going on "in a constructive way." "What 
does not suit the Primorye administration then? -- Perhaps, only 
the fact that the money will go not directly to it, but through 
the center, i.e. through Moscow," the diplomat suggested.

  [Text] Andrey Kokoshin, Russian first deputy defense 
minister, has declared that the results of the financing of the 
Defense Ministry in the first quarter show that the situation 
regarding the revenue part of the budget is deteriorating. 
  The state's debts to suppliers of defense equipment and to 
servicemen today have reached 3 trillion rubles. In February 
and March, 70 percent of servicemen received no monetary 
remuneration. According to Kokoshin, the Defense Ministry favors 
joint efforts by the executive and legislative authorities to 
increase the revenue part of the budget.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 11 of 24 March] </F>
  [Text] Career officers in Russia are currently quite 
concerned by the absence of prescribed strength of army units 
and by what many believe to be insufficient financing of the 
Armed Forces. Sergey Safronov of INTERFAX discussed the problems 
of the Russian navy with Deputy Supreme Commander of the Navy 
Admiral Igor Kasatonov. 
  INTERFAX: The economic decline in Russia continues. How 
will it effect the combat capability of the navy? 
  KASATONOV: The navy as an operational-strategic formation 
guaranteeing the defence capability of the country is extremely 
dependent on the state of the national economy, primarily on 
industrial production and the many-tier cooperation between 
numerous Russian companies. It so happens that components for 
many goods, including high tech, were manufactured in different 
parts of the former USSR. Therefore the collapse of the Soviet 
Union largely influenced the navy. 
  During the first two years after the disintegration of the 
country the navy remained afloat following its old strategic 
doctrine, even though some changes had to be made in it. The 
maintenance of the strong Northern and Pacific fleets performing 
oceanic tasks was the main concern while the Baltic and Black 
Sea Fleets were meant for regional purposes. 
  INTERFAX:What political consequences did the disappearance 
of 
the USSR have for the navy? 
  KASATONOV: The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in the 
loss of the strategic space, the appearance of local naval 
formations. Thus in the Baltic Russia now has two isolated areas 
of deployment. The situation on the Black sea is even more 
complicated. There a significant share of the fleet -- an 
exceptional gain of the Russian people -- has been divided 
between Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova (in the latter case the 
admiral meant the Black Sea-Danube flotilla. - INTERFAX). 
  For centuries the Russian navy worked to conquer an 
appropriate strategic space which allowed to guarantee the 
security of the state. The goal was achieved and the strategic 
space used to include what now constitutes the newly-independent 
countries. And they do not seem to need our navy... 
  Russia has been left with only a small part of its old 
strategic space which does not guarantee the necessary security 
of the country. I think that from this viewpoint the interests 
of our great power were damaged, because most of our closest 
neighbors resist agreements on joint defence. In others, like 
Georgia for example, the political situation is not sufficiently 
stable. 
  In my opinion, in this respect Russia is facing considerable 
difficulties with organizing defence. Such problems must be 
resolved diplomatically on the basis of international law. In 
case compromise is impossible and old ties cannot be restored, 
Russia will have to act proceeding only from its own interests. 
To resolve these questions the Russian leadership should 
demonstrate wisdom and realize who is our true friend. I think 
the problem will be resolved, but not today. 
  INTERFAX: Which of the Russian fleets is the strongest 
today? 
  KASATONOV: The North Fleet is the closest to the prescribed 
strength. It forms the bulk of the strategic naval force which 
is an element the Russian nuclear triad. To a considerable 
extent it guarantees the defence of Russian interests in the 
northern direction. The fleet is an important deterrent for the 
possible aggressor. 
  Even though Russia and the USA have become partners in 
principle, regular contacts and even collisions with American 
submarines off the coast of North Russia indicate that the 
American navy has not left our waters. The fact that foreign 
subs move near the Russian coast, the Kola peninsula, for 
example, while Russian subs are not moving near Florida or 
California cannot help worrying us military people. 
  Foreign nuclear submarines regularly appear off the Russian 
coast in the Far East as well. We are keeping statistics of 
these instances. An analysis of the information shows that 
unfortunately foreign navies have kept their combat means and 
combat formations. 
  INTERFAX: There was a time when this country renounced the 
construction of aircraft-carriers and concentrated on nuclear 
submarines. Now Russia is building aircraft-carrying ships. 
What is the strategy of the Russian navy for the future? 
  KASATONOV: The Soviet leadership proceeded from the 
principle of balanced development of the navy believing that the 
force should be ready to carry out any task. However, the 
approach to the future was quite subjective and depended on the 
person who headed the state, the Defence Ministry or navy. As a 
result, in my opinion, the navy was weakened from the viewpoint 
of combat means. The situation was even worse in auxiliary 
forces. 
  It is true that the USSR gave preference to submarines even 
though national interests also required the construction of 
aircarft-carriers. Most countries do not make such giants, 
actually only the USA can afford such a luxury. Many countries 
prefer making ships of the intermediate class that can take on 
jump jets and helicopters. 
  Only in the late 80s the Soviet Union recognized the need to 
have aircraft-carriers. The Admiral Kuznetsov has been built, 
the Varyag is 85ready and launched. However, the situation 
with the latter is complicated as the Varyag is in foreign 
territory - Ukraine. There are many Russians in that country as 
well as those who truly love Russia and find the split between 
our two nations a mistake. Nevertheless, no one can tell whether 
the Varyag will be completed or not. 
  As for strategy, I can say that in the future the Russian 
Federation will make ships of the same class with the 
displacement of 10 to 12 thousand tons as well as 4 to 5 
thousand ton ships. The submarine fleet will also develop. But 
all that is going to happen in keeping with international 
agreements. 
  INTERFAX: Let's return to the Black Sea Fleet. We would 
want to know your opinion of the recent statement by the Supreme 
Commander of the Ukrainian Navy Admiral Beskaravainy about the 
need to divide the fleet. 
  KASATONOV: The Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed a 
document stating that Kiev is surrendering its part of the fleet 
to Russia as payment for its debts. Therefore the declarations 
of other persons contradicting this document are empty rhetoric, 
as the political decision has been made already. 
  The saddest thing about it is that the main base of the 
fleet, Sevastopol, is degrading. Like in besieged Leningrad 
people carry water in buckets and sit in the light of oil lamps 
in the evenings. 
  INTERFAX: But can the statement of the Ukrainian admiral 
indicate a change in the official attitude of Kiev to the fleet? 
  KASATONOV: Plenty of declarations can be made, but the 
people of the Crimea have expressed their will: the 
overwhelming majority voted for Yuri Meshkov in the elections of 
the Crimean president. (Yuri Meshkov is a supporter of stronger 
ties between the Crimea and Russia. - Interfax). Ukraine is 
also heading for elections, therefore one should be more careful 
with political declarations and heed the opinion of women 
standing in lines at food stores. 
  INTERFAX: In the Soviet Union it was not customary to admit 
the existence of naval bases abroad even though we had them at 
least in Vietnam and Cuba. Does Russia have overseas naval 
bases? 
  KASATONOV: I would like to stress that Russia does not have 
overseas naval bases as such. There are only so-called 
logistical points. One of them is in Camranh, Vietnam. By the 
way we are keeping it largely at the insistence of the 
Vietnamese side. In general the Russian military doctrine 
abroad does not provide for the formation of any overseas bases. 
  You probably know that the USA, Britain and other countries 
are also cutting on bases abroad. The situation in the world is 
such that there is no need for them. Hopefully other NATO 
countries will give up military bases too. 
  INTERFAX: Why is Vietnam interested in keeping Russian 
presence in Camranh? 
  KASATONOV: Vietnam as well as many other countries realizes 
the importance of Russia in world politics, in resolving 
economic matters. A number of countries relies on Russian 
machinery and technology in their economies and these ties 
cannot be severed just like that. This also applies to former 
Soviet republics. 
  INTERFAX: Does the Russian navy intend to cooperate with the 
navies of NATO countries? 
  KASATONOV: Such cooperation is a reality already. Between 
March 23 and 25 the United States, Britain, Netherlands, Norway 
and the Russian Federation conducted joint naval exercises in 
the Barents sea. Norway was in charge of overall command. The 
purpose was to exercise joint actions to search and rescue 
people out at sea, joint maneuvering and communications. 
  INTERFAX: Recently ships of the Black Sea Fleet carried out 
a combat mission on the coast of Georgia when hostilities were 
under way in West Georgia between government troops and 
supporters of the former president Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The 
question of opening a Russian naval base in Poti, Georgia was 
raised then. 
  KASATONOV: The question can be decided only when the 
situation in Georgia stabilizes. At the moment political and 
economic conditions in Georgia are such, that the presence of 
the Black Sea Fleet there would not meet the interests of 
Russia. No one is working in the city, there is no food, only 
large-scale looting. What interests can Russia have there?

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 2020 GMT on 24 March carries a two-minute video 
report by A. Peslyak in the "Vesti" newscast on Russia's 
destruction of its chemical weapons. Peslyak begins by recapping 
Russia's international commitment to destroy its chemical 
weapons and to discontinue their production. He reports on the 
debate on this topic in the State Duma on 24 March. The main 
problem was storage of the weapons until they could be 
destroyed. The video shows the Duma being addressed by Major 
General Yuriy Tarasevich, deputy head of the chemical defense 
troops of the Russian Federation, who said: "You must understand 
that we cannot do anything about the storage areas themselves. 
Therefore we are saying at the present time that the most 
dangerous situation has arisen in these two arsenals we have. 
That's in (Kompapino) and especially in Gornyy, Saratov Oblast." 
  Peslyak says that the Defense Ministry was asking for half a 
billion dollars to finance the destruction of the weapons. The 
video then showed an excerpt of an interview with V. Nikonov, 
deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on International 
Affairs, identified by caption, who says: "The means of 
eliminating the chemical weapons has yet to be decided upon. 
The sites where the destruction of the chemical weapons is to 
take place have yet to be chosen. As you can see from the 
hearing, the settling of these matters with local authorities 
and, moreover, with local inhabitants is running into 
considerable difficulties." 
  Peslyak points out that a factory in Chapayevsk equipped 
with ultra-modern technology was standing idle when it could be 
used for destroying chemical weapons. Video shows the exterior 
and interior of a factory, with its machinery wrapped in plastic 
sheeting. No one was taking responsibility for this, he says; 
it is difficult to know just how much toxic material there is to 
be destroyed, saying there could be "40,000, 80,000 or 400,000 
tonnes."

'Olympic' Cut in the Armed Forces"] 
  [Text] The defense minister is soon likely to cut the 
number of his deputies from seven to four. Generals Gromov and 
Toporov are running the risk of being the first among those to 
be axed. 
  Observers think that Boris Gromov -- one of the most likely 
contenders for the position of minister if it becomes vacant -- 
is thus being "taken out of the game." Who the third one will 
be is yet unknown. 
  Radical reforms in the ministry have long been expected. The 
deputies -- Generals Toporov and Mironov -- have long been 
gradually vacating the fifth floor where Pavel Grachev's office 
is located. As for Boris Gromov's office, it is in an altogether 
different building. 
  In principle, no defense minister before Gen. Grachev had 
such a number of deputies.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Russia/Italy: Andreatta Meets </F>
Yeltsin"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 10 Mar (ANSA) -- Foreign Minister Beniamino 
Andreatta of Italy conferred today in the Kremlin with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin who was quoted as telling his guest that 
Russian-Italian relations "are successfully developing in the 
political as well as the economic, humanitarian and technical 
and scientific fields." 
  The Russian leader also said, "What stirs our admiration is 
that Italian authorities interpret partnership between Russia 
and Western countries in the true sense of the word. This makes 
it possible to construct equitable and productive relations," 
added Yeltsin. 
  Also taking part in the meeting were Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and the president's advisor on international affairs, 
Dimitriy Ryurikov. 
  At the end of this meeting, Andreatta went to the Kozyrev's 
residence where the two foreign ministers continued their talk. 
  The Italian minister arrived in Moscow in the evening 
yesterday. In the afternoon today, after a meeting with 
journalists at the Italian Embassy here, Andreatta will leave 
Moscow to travel to Tallinn and Vilnius for talks with Estonian 
and Lithuanian leaders. 
  Andreatta arrived here in his role as duty-president of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Group 
of Seven ministerial councils. His talks were expected to 
center on Bosnia, the CSCE activities and on greater 
participation by Russia in the context of the Group of Seven 
leading industrial nations, scheduled to hold their annual 
summit in Naples in early July.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Yeltsin Hastens His Official Visit </F>
to Spain in Order To Go to Barcelona Hospital"] 
  [Text] Madrid/Barcelona -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
intends to kill two birds with one stone in mid-April: Finally 
to pay his first state visit to Spain, and also to go to the 
Barcelona Hospital -- where he underwent an operation four years 
ago -- presumably in order to undergo a medical checkup, 
according to Spanish and Russian sources. The ITAR-TASS Russian 
official press agency yesterday announced the presidential visit 
to Spain, of which the Spanish authorities learned with surprise 
25 February. 
  "I know, I know; do not tell me, because I assure you that I 
will soon be going to Spain." With these words Yeltsin began 
his meeting with Felipe Gonzalez in Brussels in December. He 
thus made clear his bad conscience about having postponed his 
first visit to Spain as head of state on several occasions since 
August 1992, because of his country's instability. 
  The Russian leader will spend two days in Madrid -- 11-12 
April -- and has expressed his intention to visit Barcelona 
immediately after. The length of his stay in the Catalan 
capital is not clear, and could be between 24 and 72 hours. 
Late yesterday afternoon, the doctors who treated him in 
Barcelona received a telephone call from Moscow, announcing, 
without specifying the date or reason, an imminent visit by the 
Russian president, Milagros Perez Oliva reports. 
  In Barcelona's medical circles it was taken for granted that 
Yeltsin would not confine himself to paying a mere formal visit, 
but would take the opportunity to have a checkup. In May 1990, 
when he was a mere deputy, Yeltsin underwent an operation for a 
slipped disk by the medical team of neurosurgeon Josep Llovet 
Tapies. 
  Since then, Llovet and his colleagues, whom Yeltsin 
describes 
as "the best doctors in the world," have continued to treat the 
Russian president. Llovet last went to Moscow for this reason 
last September, aboard an aircraft which the Russian head of 
state placed at his disposal. Rumors circulating in the Russian 
capital indicate that he is suffering from increasing backache. 
  At the first preparatory meeting for the visit, the Russians 
expressed their interest in concluding with Spain a framework 
treaty of friendship and cooperation, like the one that was once 
signed with the USSR. They also indicated readiness to sign 
several agreements, including a social security agreement which 
would partially resolve the situation of the famous "war 
children" -- the Spanish children who fled to the Soviet Union 
at the height of the [Spanish] Civil War. 
  Another important reason for hastening the visit to Madrid 
is 
the desire to become better acquainted with the experience of 
the Moncloa Pacts, which facilitated the transition from 
Francoism to democracy at the end of the seventies, Pilar Bonet 
reports from Moscow. Those pacts, or the idea which people now 
have of them in Moscow, were a frequent reference point during 
the parliamentary debate which granted an amnesty to Yeltsin's 
main opponents, and seem to inspire a new presidential 
initiative aimed at achieving a charter of social accord with 
all the political forces.

  [Text] At the sitting of the government's presidium today, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said that the state administrative apparatus 
had unjustifiably swollen in recent years. He said that in 
1991, during the existence of the Soviet Union, executives at 
all levels had numbered 715,000, while now there were 921,000 
state employees in the Russian Federation. There were 350,000 
bureaucrats in the district administrative team alone. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin criticized the Ministry of Finance which had 
complied with requests from the regions to finance the bloated 
adminstrative bodies.

  [Text] Moscow, March 19, RIA - Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said 
that life would become better within six months after his advent 
to power. He made this promise at the 7th conference of the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which is being held on the eve 
of the party's fifth congress scheduled for April 2. The LDP 
leader is confident that if his party gained success at the 
elections to the Duma, his manners and behaviour are quite right 
and should not be changed. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy called upon the LDP to get ready for 
the presidential elections which, in his opinion, may take place 
already this year. In his opinion, neither Shakhray, nor 
Yavlinskiy, nor Sobchak will be able to harvest over 10 percent 
of voices and Rutskoy, who "may get more", is also no 
challenger. "Our party has real chances to be a success," said 
the LDP leader. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy assured the participants in the 
conference of no prospects for any split in the party or any 
collective leadership. "We have undivided authority and, at the 
same time, full democracy," said Zhirinovskiy.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Karaganov, Deputy Director of the </F>
European Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and a 
Foreign Affairs Adviser to President Yeltsin; "Russia Finds 
Independent Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] The electoral success of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's 
Liberal Democratic Party has -- naturally -- made the future 
direction of Russian foreign policy an important international 
issue. 
  The emergence of a movement like Zhirinovskiy's was 
predictable. It was a normal reaction from those strata who are 
suffering economically, who have witnessed the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union, which they thought would be their homeland for 
centuries, and who are now left with no vision of where their 
country is going. 
  If, however, a lesson has been learnt -- and it looks as if 
President Boris Yeltsin is learning it -- it is that 
Zhirinovskiy is a dark cloud on the horizon but not the horizon 
itself. There is still a long way to go before we glimpse 
light. But the road to normalcy is the one Russia is on. 
  Being normal naturally means having a normal foreign policy. 
This is now emerging; and it is emerging in direct reaction to 
the recent past, the period immediately after the failed coup of 
1991 and the emergence of Russia as an independent state. 
During that period, Russia was too inclined to say "yes" to our 
new friends in the West -- even before being asked to. We 
suffered a temporary loss of our vision and of our ability both 
to understand, and act in, our own interests. This created a 
backlash. 
  Under foreign minister Andrey Kozyrev, an attentive 
listener, 
Russian foreign policy has since made big adjustments while 
never changing its basic course towards strategic rapprochement 
with the west. It is now better formulated and less one-sided. 
It has achieved a significant success in persuading the Serbs 
to pull back from Sarajevo. It is focusing much more than 
before on the Commonwealth of Independent States and on former 
partners in Europe. And it is active in Asia, too. 
  Russia has learned to express its differences with others as 
well as to chorus its assent. Differences have centred on 
former Yugoslavia and on the continuing inaccessibility of 
Western markets to our goods; in particular, Russia's ruling 
elites and the increasingly influential military oppose plans to 
enlarge Nato by admitting east-central European states (but not 
Russia), believing this threatens Russia with geopolitical 
isolation. 
  At the heart of the problems and tensions between Russia and 
the west is, and will remain, the relations Russia strikes with 
the former Soviet republics. 
  In autumn last year, Russia took decisions which forced most 
CIS countries out of the rouble zone. The decisions were 
prompted by exasperation at the lack of reform in these states, 
especially Ukraine, and by Russia's unwillingness and inability 
still to subsidise them. 
  In any reintegration of former Soviet states, Russia will 
play a different role from that in the old Soviet Union (which 
was a strange combination of political metropolis and economic 
colonies) or in the first two years of the CIS's existence. 
During the latter, Russia was uncertain about how to proceed; 
it knew lt could no longer be donor and boss but it did not know 
whether to increase separation or try a new form of 
re-integration. 
  Now, it seems, there is a growing consensus. Most feasible 
regimes in Moscow (except for a national socialist one, which 
would try to force political reintegration) would probably 
attempt a modality under which CIS countries would remain 
independent politically but be dominated economically. No sane 
politician in Moscow would choose to take responsibility for 
managing both the surrounding weak economies and their turbulent 
societies as that would mean taking responsibilities off the 
shoulders of local leaderships and free them to blame Russia for 
all their ills. Russia also cannot afford total separation, nor 
a policy of benign negligence. 
  In this model, Russia would play the role of first among 
equals in interstate relations in the CIS rather like the US in 
Nato, or Germany in the European Union -- but not big brother 
protecting and feeding his younger kin (though elements of these 
roles will remain). 
  Russia will also have to continue to be a local peace keeper 
or peace enforcer. To do this effectively and avoid becoming a 
militaristic state, Russia needs two conditions fulfilled. 
First, her role as peace keeper should be legitimate; and 
second, it should be part of an international effort -- under 
the control of international organisations and constrained by 
international law. That would deter Moscow from unlimited use of 
military power and ultimately dangerous unilateralism. 
  Russia is now beginning to act but neither as the former 
Communist enfant terrible nor as the terribly nice guy of the 
late Gorbachev early Yeltsin period. Is the west ready to part 
with this nice guy, this Mr Yes -- and work with an independent 
partner and prospective ally? I trust the answer will be in the 
affirmative -- though, of course, I well understand how nice it 
was to talk with Mr Yes.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Russian Economics Minister, </F>
Aleksandr Shokhin, in Moscow, 17 Mar] 
  [Text] Russia's prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
submitted his budget to parliament yesterday, saying the 
economic crisis was serious but under control. However, his 
economics minister, Aleksandr Shokhin, later told THE GUARDIAN 
that without "extraordinary measures" the government would be 
unable to get the income needed to make it work. 
  The latest version of the budget envisages spending 183,000 
billion roubles (70.4 billion pounds) and a deficit of 62,400 
billion roubles (24.3 bilion pounds), or around 9 per cent of 
gross domestic product [GDP]. This is a marginal revision of an 
earlier draft, approved last month which talked of a deficit of 
"about 10.2 per cent of GNP [Gross National Product]". 
  In giving these figures, Mr Chernomyrdin rejected the 
demands 
of the industrial lobby for public spending of 243,000 billion 
roubles (93.9 billion pounds). "We cannot afford this," he told 
the Council of the Federation the upper house of parliament in a 
lacklustre speech. 
  Mr Chernomyrdin rejected the idea of declaring an economic 
state of emergency which he said would eliminate the possibility 
of pursuing economic reforms. 
  But in the corridors after the prime minister's speech, Mr 
Shokhin said extraordinary legislative measures would have to be 
introduced quickly if the government income foreseen in the 
budget were to be realised. 
  Mr Shokhin said: "January and Febuary showed a decrease in 
industrial production of more than 24 per cent and I have to 
stress that this is the fifth successive year of decrease. We 
have now come to a make or break point. Either the market 
mechanism begins to work, or the process of industrial decline 
in a very broad scale will produce massive unemployment and the 
complete stop of industry, which would only help the most 
radical circles in the opposition." 
  He said the central problem was to get money circulating 
again in the Russian economy. Russian companies had stashed 
13.4 billion pounds in foreign bank accounts to avoid taxes. 
  "We have to reassert control of all the money in 
circulation," he said. "We need extraordinary measures this 
month to get the normal market mechanisms going again. There is 
a lot of money in the country's economy but it is not used 
according to the rules of a market economy." He did not 
elaborate on what amendments would be made to tax or foreign 
exchange laws. 
  At a cabinet meeting yesterday, Mr Shokhin was nominated as 
the government's representative on one of five "round table" 
groups to represent the executive, the legislature and political 
parties. The idea of the round tables was to hammer out a 
common accord on the economy, the regions and republics, and 
three other problem areas. 
  After his speech, Mr Chernomyrdin tried to avoid answering 
questions from the representatives of the regions in the upper 
house. He would only say: "Come and talk to me in the White 
House." 
  When Nikolay Gonshar chairman of the chamber's economy 
committee, started speaking of Japan's economic regeneration 
after the war, Mr Chernomyrdin broke in: "Don't compare us with 
Japan. The Japanese after the last war worked for 17 years 
without taking one day off on holiday, whereas our workers 
cannot keep sober from one Sunday to another."

  [Text] Moscow, March 21, RIA -- Highly profitable 
enterprises are to be sold at open voucher auctions by late 
June. Their list includes the Gas-Prom joint-stock entity and 
the Norilsk nickel concern that annually scoop up 1 billion in 
hard-currency revenues. This was stated here today by Anatoliy 
Chubays, chairman of the Russian State Committee for the 
Management of State Property in the course of hearings on the 
Russian privatization drive being held by the State Duma's 
Committee on Property, Privatization and Economic Activity. 
  According to Chubays, the Russian privatization concept has 
worked on the whole, with the state getting back 88 million 
privatization checks (out of the 148 million checks issued to 
the population that still has 12 million vouchers). The rest 
are wielded by commercial organizations and by the nation's 650 
voucher investment funds. In his words, the voucher's price is 
bound to keep growing steadily. As a matter of fact, it has 
soared 50 per cent over the last two weeks when it became 
crystal clear that not a single political opponent could affect 
the pace of national privatization.

<F P=106> [By editorial writer Akihiko Ushiba] </F>
  [Text] It was said during the Gulf War that high-tech 
weapons such as aircraft, tanks, and missiles produced by Russia 
(or the former Soviet Union) were inferior in performance to 
those developed by the United States and other Western 
countries. However, it has become clear since the war that 
Russia has made advances in the development of high-tech weapons 
at a much faster pace than predicted. Sources well versed in 
international military affairs said: "One of Russia's aims is 
to obtain foreign currency through the export of high-tech 
weapons." They also noted that "more fundamentally, the aim is 
to build up the Army with the long-term in view." The comments 
are a warning that if Western nations, currently enjoying the 
post-Cold War peace, neglect research and development, it is 
possible their high-tech weapons technology will be behind that 
of Russia 10 years from now. 
  Among Russia's high-tech weapons is the "SU-34 air fighter," 
dubbed "Russia's miracle," which has been a source of surprise 
for military analysts in Western nations. The aircraft, which 
can fly a distance of up to 4,000 km without the need to use 
reserve fuel, is equipped with a system which makes it possible 
for the aircraft to skim over terrain and make observations in 
the way a cruise missile can. 
  A big difference between the SU-34 and conventional Russian 
military aircraft lies in its "comfort." The cockpit of the 
SU-34, which is covered with 17-mm-thick bullet-proof glass, is 
equipped with an air conditioner, a microwave oven, and a 
toilet. The cockpit is so large that a pilot can stand up and 
do exercises inside it. It is said that even after flying a 
distance of 1,000 kilometers, the pilot of an SU-34 feels no 
fatigue and can immediately go into combat operation. 
  There is also an SU-35 air fighter, which is capable of 
carrying out the "cobra" maneuver in which the aircraft climbs 
while flying in circles. Western nations have no aircraft 
superior to the SU-35, and it is suspected their best planes 
would lose out in a dogfight against the SU-35. 
  Russia is also expected to put FST-2 and FST-3 tanks into 
practical use in the late nineties. 
  These tanks carry either a 135-mm or 145-mm gun, larger than 
the (120-mm) gun carried by Western tanks. It is said that 
because these tanks are made of "advanced armor plate" such as a 
ceramic complex armor plate and electromagnetic armor plate, 
Western tank shells would not be able to penetrate them. 
  Russia is also currently improving and modernizing its SS-25 
strategic nuclear missile. It is also developing the SS-X-26 
and SS-X-27 missiles. Among Russian-made missiles, the AAML 
air-to-air missile has drawn much attention because of its long 
400 km range. In comparison, U.S. Phoenix missile has a range of 
only 150 km, the longest among comparable U.S. missiles. With 
the AAML Russia can attack weapons such as airborne warning and 
control system (AWACS) aircraft, a key command device, from a 
distance out of firing range. 
  Russian research and development of high-tech weapons covers 
a wide area. In addition to the aforementioned weapons, it is 
also energetically developing helicopters, armored vehicles, and 
firearms. During the period 1991 and 1993, Russia developed 14 
new pieces of equipment in nine different weaponry areas. It is 
said Russia is currently developing about 30 kinds of new weapon 
over more than 12 areas. 
  It is believed that following the collapse of the former 
Soviet Union, Russia, with the help of Western nations, promoted 
the conversion of the defense industry to civilian production in 
preparation for a shift toward a market economy. Nevertheless, 
Russia has made advances in weapons development. A military 
expert believes that "because it cannot produce good civilian 
products, Russia is gradually going back to the development of 
weapons, which is its strength." He said it should also be 
noted that "even in the current political and economic 
confusion, the Russian Army is steadily preparing for 10 years 
from now."

<F P=106> ["Viewpoint" report; materials prepared by the Public </F>
Opinion Foundation, Viewpoint's sociological service, and the 
INTERFAX News Agency] 
  [Text] "It is time for President Yeltsin to step down", 
believe 46% of the Russian city respondents. 
  The notions "market," "reform," "renewal" are in the 
background of the Russian mentality. 
  The Russians do not imagine a decent life without 
children, while the Americans without educated children. 
  The reform acceleration means the transfer to regulated 
prices, believe almost 25% of the pro-acceleration repondents. 
  Russian rich people may envy their American counterparts. 
  Directors more often consider the work collective as the 
owner of a privatized enterprise, while the workers consider it 
is the director. 
  As many as 49% of the polled Russian city residents 
believe high prices are better than the deficit. 
  "IT IS TIME FOR PRESIDENT YELTSIN TO STEP DOWN", believe 
46% of the polled residents of the Russian cities. 
  Asked "Do you believe that it is time for President Yeltsin 
to step down?", the respondents answered in the following way: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         |September 1993 (%)       |February 1994 (%)        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yes                      |30                       |46                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|No                       |41                       |34                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Undecided                |29                       |20                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Thus, over six months the number of people who believe that 
it is time for President Yeltsin to resign increased by 
16%. 
Their number has grown at the expense of those who earlier were 
against the resignation, and at the expense of those who earlier 
were undecided. 
<H3>  NOTIONS "MARKET", "REFORM" AND "RENEWAL" AT THE BACKGROUND 
OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE MENTALITY </H3>
  During the poll conducted late last year, the 3483 
respondents were suggested to underline the words which express 
in the best way their impression of a decent, happy life and 
Russia's renewal. No more than 9 out of 38 words were to be

  Among the outsiders are the words which symbolize changes. 
Sociologists have found that people of Russia are seeking calm 
and prosperity but only a few link these notions with the 
economic reforms going on in the country. 
<H3>  RUSSIAN PEOPLE DO NOT IMAGINE HAPPY LIFE WITHOUT CHILDREN, 
WHILE THEIR AMERICAN COUNTERPARTS WITHOUT EDUCATED CHILDREN </H3>
  To the question: "What do you need for a happy life?" 
Americans and Russian answer in the following way (the first 
three places):

  Like the Russians, the Americans do not imagine a happy life 
without children. However, they attach much importance to the 
education of the young generation, while the Russians think in 
the last place about this (19th line in the list). 
  People of Russia link more rarely than the Americans the 
happy life with the interesting job. The Russians place it the 
16th on the list, the Americans place it above the highly-paid 
job. The Russians want to gain much money. Well, when it comes 
to money, the Russians say that much money is good for a decent 
life. 
  The "loyal friends" are among the first ten component parts 
of the happy life. The Americans have no such point. 
  Taking part in the poll held in November 1993 were 1472 
inhabitants of the towns and villages of the Voronezh and Tula 
regions. 
  In the United States that poll was conducted by the Roper 
Organization. 
  "SPEEDING UP REFORMS MEANS TRANSFER TO REGULATED PRICES," 
believes one fourth of respondents backing such a speeding up. 
"Implementation of economic reforms in Russia should be sped 
up," believe 41% of respondents representing Russia's city 
residents. As many as 13% are in favor it their slowing down, 
and 16% believe that it's high time to stop the reforms. A 
total of 30% of the opinion poll participants found it 
difficult to answer this question. 
  Those who spoke in favor of reforms' speeding up adhere to 
following notions regarding the essence of economic reforms 
(percentage of those who wish to speed up reforms):

  Sociologists believe that Russians still have no clear 
notion 
what is "the speeding up of economic reforms." Respondents had 
an opportunity to choose three answers; this should have 
increased the percentage of those who answered any of the 
proposed variants. More than one third of the respondents 
called "taxes' lowering." 
  However, the population knows quite well that the reform 
must 
improve the life. That's why many of its supporters believe 
that it must improve their private well-being. There are 
different notions about the reform in the society: some people 
connect speeding up of the economic reform with their near term 
interests, expectations (increase of wages, transfer to 
regulated prices, etc.) and others -- with real changes in the 
economy's type. 
  Analysts think that it is not by chance that "lowering of 
prices" received the first place. According to experts, those 
who think that the question concerns taxes of enterprises, those 
who perceived them as income taxes, those who think about the 
reform as about "a good life," and those who are concerned over 
the changes in the type of the economy have presented identical 
answers. People tried to introduce the facts which are going on 
in the country into the sphere of their interests, expectations, 
and wishes. 
  As many as 1059 respondents living in various cities of 
Russia participated in the opinion poll held this February. 
  THE RICH IN RUSSIA WILL ENVY THE RICH IN AMERICA..... if 
they 
consider the nation's attitude to them. 
  Here's how the question: "Do you agree that the state must 
restrict the level of incomes earned by the wealthiest people?" 
put to American and Russian citizens was answered (% of 
the 
number of those questioned): 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         |Americans                |Russians                 | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yes                      |9                        |52                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|No                       |83                       |31                       |

|Undecided                |8                        |17                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  A majority of respondents in the USA are against restricting 
incomes. The Russians think differently. According to 
analysts, many Russians believe that this will help the poor. 
  In the Russian Federation the poll was conducted among the 
urban and rural population in Voronezh and Tula Regions last 
November. 1472 persons were questioned. In the USA it was 
sponsored by The Roper Organization (Roper reports 92-2). 
<H3>  DIRECTORS VIEW LABOR STAFFS AS OWNERS OF PRIVATIZED 
FACILITY, WHILE WORKERS BELIEVE THAT DIRECTORS ARE THE OWNERS </H3>
  This conclusion can be made after reviewing answers to the 
following question: "Who is the real owner of privatized 
facility in your view?" (% of the number of those questioned). 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         |Directors                |Workers                  | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|It's the director        |7                        |25                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|It's the labor staff     |43                       |24                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  This question related to the privatization formula under 
which most shares are in the hands of the labor staff. 
According to analysts, the difference in the views of the 
directors and the workers shows that in the near future the real 
process of privatization may give rise to confrontations or 
conflicts between the leaders of privatized facilities and their 
rank-and- file members. 
  The poll was conducted at the end of last year; it involved 
3483 respondents. 
<H3>  49% OF RESPONDENTS IN RUSSIAN CITIES PREFER HIGH 
PRICES TO 
SHORTAGES 
"What do you prefer: shortages of goods with low prices, or 
availability of goods with high prices?" </H3>



------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Shortages of goods with low prices    |25%                                   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Availability of goods with high prices|49%                                   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Undecided                             |26%                                   | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  When people are invited to make a choice: whether to return 
to the past, to the empty shops of 1991, or remain in the 
present with its supermarkets which in the past could be seen 
only on television screens, not simply evaluate the reforms, a 
majority of respondents opt for the present after all. Much 
fewer people wish to return to the past. 
  The poll was conducted among Russia's urban population last 
February; it involved 1204 respondents.

<F P=106> [Chrystia Feeland report: "The Tragedy and the Irony of </F>
Village Conservatism"] 
  [Text] To the amazement of outside observers Ukraine's 
election campaign is not being fought primarily on economic 
issues. But, if Ukraine is to have any hope of averting the sort 
of disaster foreign experts predict, then the day after they 
take up their seats, the new MPs will have to face up to the 
issues they have been avoiding on the campaign trail. 
  On its own, Ukraine's economic plight is cause enough for 
serious international concern. Ukraine's macro-economic record 
-- the worst in the former Soviet Union -- is so dreadful that 
the beleaguered officials of the International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank in Kiev have taken to raising their spirits by 
counting the inventive new ways Ukrainian officials are 
constantly discovering to destroy their economy. 
  But what makes fragile Ukraine particularly important now is 
its increasingly hostile relationship with Russia. Russians -- 
ranging across the political spectrum from Lenin to Solzhenitzyn 
-- have always seen Ukraine as an integral part of "Greater 
Russia". As Russian foreign policy hardens in the aftermath of 
the elections there in December and in reaction to Russia's own 
economic travails, Moscow's pressure on Kiev to re-submit to 
Russian rule has become stronger. 
  Ukraine's economic collapse makes it more difficult for Kiev 
to resist; at the same time, the nation's political 
determination to remain independent is growing stronger. This 
makes Ukraine a particularly volatile partner in what is already 
a tense relationship, hence the CIA's gloomy prediction earlier 
this year of a "probable" conflict between the two Slav giants. 
  It is in the cities, with their greater voting power, that 
the outcome of Ukraine's election will be decided. There, the 
race is far more competitive and a new political class, 
representing a fledgling middle class rather than the entrenched 
ex-communist nomenklatura, could emerge. 
  Ukraine's tragedy is that the uncomplaining resilience of 
its 
villages is likely to help keep its inept government in place. 
The irony is that it is the villages, with their tradition of 
hard- working self-sufficiency, which could be the driving force 
behind a Ukrainian economic revival -- if Ukrainian voters are 
ever able to elect a government with the courage and skill to 
initiate reforms.

  [Text] An hour ago, in the Lithuanian town of Palanga, the 
meeting of the presidents of the Baltic countries -- Algirdas 
Brazauskas, Guntis Ulmanis, and Lennart Meri -- began. The 
Lithuanian president held a lunch for his honored guests. 
Afterward, the meeting of the three Baltic countries' 
delegations and the presidents' talks began. During the 
meeting, they are going to discuss the integration of the Baltic 
countries into Western European structures, coming closer 
together with NATO, relations with neighboring states -- Russia 
-- and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia. 
Several documents are also due to be signed. The meeting will 
conclude with a ceremonial dinner.

  [Text] The presidents of the three Baltic countries met 
today in the Lithuanian town of Palanga. As the presidents 
noted in their concluding communique, the meeting proceeded in a 
friendly atmosphere of mutual understanding. The leaders of the 
Baltic countries expressed satisfaction at what the Baltic 
countries have achieved during the period of closer cooperation 
that has passed since their last meeting in Tallinn last 
December. The talks were especially concerned with questions of 
Baltic relations with the European Union, NATO and other 
international organizations. An agreement was signed on the 
creation of the consultative coordinating organ, the Baltic 
Presidential Council. 
  After a proposal by Latvia there was also discussion of the 
higher level of [passage indistinct]

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 25, BNS -- Cooperation between the 
Baltic states develops but "this does not mean that cooperation 
cannot be improved," Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas 
said on the eve of his meeting with Estonian and Latvian 
presidents. The Baltic leaders meet in the Lithuanian seaside 
resort of Palanga Friday [25 March]. 
  In an interview with the Voice of America and the Latvian 
newspaper DIENA, Brazauskas said much attention during the 
summit will be paid to relations of the Baltic states with other 
countries, including Russia. The three leaders also intend to 
discuss steps that must be taken to approach the European Union. 
  Well-informed sources said one of Lithuania's initiatives 
for 
the summit is a joint resolution on coordination of actions in 
international organizations. The Baltic presidents are also 
expected to discuss the work of embassies and possibilities to 
create joint Baltic consulates. 
  Lithuania intends to propose a resolution on cooperation 
with 
countries of the Visegrad Treaty, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland and Slovakia. 
  According to the summit's program, the presidents are 
scheduled to hold trilateral and bilateral meetings.

  [Text] Following is the text of the Statement of the 
Presidents of the Baltic States on Coordination of Actions 
vis-a-vis EU, NATO, Other International Structures, and in 
Strengthening Stability in Europe: 
  [Begin text] We, the Presidents of Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania met in Palanga, Lithuania on 25 March 1994, to discuss 
matters of mutual concern, in particular the integration of the 
three Baltic States with the economic, political and security 
structures of Europe. 
  We discussed our progress achieved to date in developing 
co-operation among our states in a number of fields. In this 
context, we noted the results of our Foreign Ministers' meeting 
in Riga on 23 March 1994, in particular the agreement in 
principle on the constitution of the Baltic Council of 
Ministers. We noted with satisfaction that the Free Trade 
Agreement between our states will come into force on 1 April 
1994 and we stressed the importance of continuing negotiations 
towards supplementing this agreement with a protocol on free 
trade in agricultural goods. 
  We also noted the progress made in deepening the cooperation 
between the Baltic Sea States during the last year. We 
expressed our conviction that the Council of the Baltic Sea 
States to be convened under the Estonian chairmanship in Tallinn 
on 24-25 May 1994 will stress the importance of discussing the 
establishment of the post of a CSCE High Commissioner on human 
rights and minority questions and of reaching agreement on 
international participation in the decommissioning of the 
Baldish nuclear facility. 
  We noted that the process of strengthening political and 
economic relations with the European Union should continue 
toward the aim of rapidly concluding Free Trade Agreements with 
the European Union, and expressed the hope that Association 
(Europe) Agreements would be subsequently concluded as soon as 
possible, and not later than the end of 1994. In this 
connection, we noted that associate membership status in the 
Western European Union would further contribute to security and 
stability in Europe. 
  We welcomed the efforts of NATO to strengthen ties with the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe and asserted that NATO 
is the main guarantor of security in the Baltic region. We 
expressed our conviction that increased cooperation with NATO 
within the Partnership for Peace programme will further enhance 
security and facilitate the Baltic States integration as full 
members. In this connection, we stressed the importance of 
President Clinton recently announced decision to lift the 
embargo on arms sales to the three Baltic States as a further 
confirmation of the rapid progress achieved in restoring 
democratic institutions and instituting market economies in our 
countries. 
  We hope that the Stability Pact initiated by the European 
Union will not only strengthen security and stability in Europe 
but also contribute to the advancement of the dialogue of the 
Baltic States with the EU and help us to promote full members of 
the EU on the same basis as the Visegrad countries and other 
countries with EU association agreements. 
  We also stressed the importance of the Ukraine's decision to 
join NATO's Partnership for Peace and expressed our conviction 
the Ukraine will pay an increasingly important role in ensuring 
continued stability and security in Europe and especially in the 
near vicinity of the Baltic Sea region. The recently concluded 
bilateral agreements signed between the Ukraine and Lithuania 
and Estonia respectively form a solid basis for further 
developing relations with the Ukraine in the economic, cultural, 
political and security fields. 
  We are reaffirmed our conviction that all Russian forces 
must 
be withdrawn from Estonia and Latvia by 31 August 1994. We 
called on the international community to continue monitoring the 
situation so that this date would be observed. The Presidents 
of Estonia and Lithuania welcomed the agreement on troop 
withdrawals initialed during the last round of Latvian-Russian 
negotiations. 
  We, the Presidents of the three Baltic States, expressed the 
hope that an agreement on troop withdrawals would be initialed 
at the upcoming Estonian-Russian round in April. 
  We stressed the need for international organizations to 
strictly monitor how the Skrunda radar facility will be 
utilized, to ensure that there are no negative consequences for 
those living in the area, that the facility will not be used as 
a military base, and that it will not compromise the sovereignty 
of Latvia. 
  The resolution of these outstanding issues will, we are 
convinced, stimulate more constructive and fruitful relations 
with Russia and increase stability and security in the Baltic 
Sea region. [end text]

  [Text] Following is the text of a statement by the 
presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania issued in Palanga 
March 25 under the headline "Statement of Presidents of Estonia, 
Latvia, Lithuania on the Extension of Mutual and Regional 
Cooperation": 
  [Begin text] We, Presidents of the Baltic States, having met 
in Palanga on 25 March, 1994, state with satisfaction that the 
year 1993 has been effective in institutionalizing the 
cooperation among the Baltic States. This favorable development 
should be extended this year. The Baltic States, harmonizing 
their joint actions and the existing bilateral possibilities 
will seek coordination in their foreign policy, and in 
particular in strengthening of ties with the European political, 
economic, security structures. The Presidents will also 
initiate close cooperation among the embassies and other 
diplomatic missions of the three States as well as support joint 
representation in some States. Our three States strive for 
closer cooperation with the Nordic States and the formula "5+3" 
fully meets the interests of the Baltic States. We also fully 
support the further development of cooperation of the Baltic Sea 
region. 
  We stressed the fact that contacts between the Baltic and 
Visegrad States in the political, economic and security building 
areas can play a greater role in mutually beneficial 
cooperation. We express our readiness to intensify the dialogue 
in all fields and on all levels with a view to facilitating the 
integration of the Visegrad and the Baltic States into European 
political, economic and security structures. An important step 
in this direction will be the conclusion of a free trade 
agreement between the Baltic and Visegrad countries. 
  We welcome the initialed Lithuanian-Polish Treaty on 
Friendly 
Relations and Good Neighbourly Cooperation. We express our 
belief that this Treaty and similar treaties will be a 
politically significant achievement toward establishing 
confidence and promoting integration on the European-South axis 
-- between the Baltic and Visegrad countries. [end text]

  [Text] A meeting of Presidents Algirdas Brazauskas, Guntis 
Ulmanis, and Lennart Meri ended in Palanga late last night. 
  The Baltic states will pay a great deal of attention to 
relations with the countries of the Visegrad group. This is 
said in a statement adopted by the presidents during their 
meeting. This document notes that the presidents are for a 
dialogue at all levels between the Visegrad and Baltic states 
and for cooperation in all spheres so that these two regions 
integrate faster into the political, economic, and security 
structures in Europe. 
  At a news conference that took place after the meeting the 
Estonian President Lennart Meri noted that a new phrase was used 
for the first time in the meeting: The south-north axis. In 
this context, there were many discussions on the part played by 
Ukraine. 
  Speaking of the forthcoming elections in Ukraine, the 
Lithuanian president expressed the hope that they will be 
democratic. Journalists were told by Brazauskas that a great 
deal of attention was devoted during the meeting to 
Baltic-Russian relations. The state of Latvian and Russian 
negotiations was discussed. Brazauskas acquainted his 
colleagues with the progress of negotiations on the problems of 
Kaliningrad. Brazauskas also said at the conference that the 
success of the Estonian-Russian negotiations was one of the aims 
of our activity. 
  Latvian President Ulmanis noted that international control 
of 
the radar station in Skundra was essential. The statement by 
the presidents provides for the coordination of the policy of 
the Baltic states in relation to the European Union, NATO, and 
other international organizations. The document welcomes NATO 
endeavors to expand relations with Central and Eastern European 
states. The presidents affirmed that NATO was the most 
important guarantor of security in the Baltic region. The 
presidents also confirmed their conviction that the whole 
Russian Army must be withdrawn from Estonia and Latvia by 31 
August. 
  The presidents agreed to hold not less that twice per year 
their regular meetings to discuss pressing Baltic problems. 
  Today the Estonian and Latvian presidents are leaving 
Palanga 
for home. This was a Baltic News Service report.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 26 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
newspaper front-pages an article by Sergey Yushenkov, chairman 
of the State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament) 
committee on defence, beginning with the following words: 
"Partnership for Peace Is Part of a General Security System". 
  According to Yushenkov, legislators made two conclusions at 
parliamentary hearings. "If Russia joins the `Partnership' 
programme, it should put forth several conditions which would 
ease possible negative consequences, and this programme "should 
be regarded only as part for establishing a more general 
security system taking into account new realities of the 
post-cold war era". 
  The newspaper singles out a statement by Leonid Smirnyagin, 
a 
member of the presidential council, saying that "time for 
explanation of relations between legislative and executive 
powers has ended". 
  The country needs a memorandum on civil accord not for the 
sake of the document itself but for "paving the way for creative 
work, correcting mistakes of the past and for marching forward", 
Smirgnyagin stresses. 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with 
State 
Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin, underlining his words that "Russia 
remains a power, and many will seek to rest on its shoulder in 
future". 
  Noting that the inclusion of Russia in the European security 
system is not to everybody's liking, he calls for not making 
haste and fuss with this issue. "The same is true of `the 
Partnership for Progress' [as received] programme," he adds. 
  "Russia is not an ordinary participant in international 
process. Consequently, this circumstance should be reflected in 
the conditions of the offered partnership," he stresses. 
  Casting a short retrospective glance into the recent past of 
Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper 
states that many foreign and Russian news agencies now try to 
find out whether the former first secretary of the Sverdlovsk 
regional committee of the Soviet Communist Party had any chronic 
ailments. 
  In this connection, the newspaper writes: "Since the time 
Yeltsin took the path of war against the state-communist machine 
and up to this time, the present Russian president is, as 
specialists claim, in a chronic psychotraumatic situation. 
  "It is necessary for him to pep up himself with various 
tranquilisers, which is, after all, recommended to many people 
at his age." The newspaper quotes Yeltsin's wife as saying that 
the president "feels quite well. There is no need for 
speculating on his health". 
  The TRUD daily prints statements by several specialists and 
civil aviation pilots concerning the recent crash of an A-310 
aerobus in Mezhdurechensk. They concur in the opinion that this 
tragedy is only a link in the chain of troubles plaguing 
Aeroflot's utterly destroyed system. 
  The newspaper notes that the crash "can be the last drop 
exhausting the government's patience. It looks like that 
government decisions may follow in the near future. Apart from 
reorganisation of Aeroflot, they will trigger off reshuffling 
its entire structure". 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper prints an article by 
prominent journalist Gleb Pavlovskiy, the author of notorious 
version no.1 on an alleged state coup in russia. According to 
Pavlovskiy, the version is "a routine compilation of open 
information from news agencies, including, of course, city 
rumours". 
  It is pointed out in the article's subtitle that "the author 
of the scandalous document believes that anybody but he inspired 
the political hysteria in the upper echelon". 
  The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA daily singles out a statement by 
political parties and movements from the Orenburg region and the 
Volga area that "American troops have nothing to do on our soil". 
  This document was prompted by the fact that a tactical 
exercise is scheduled for this July at the Totskiy 
testing-ground in the Orenburg region with the participation of 
U.S. and Russian troops. 
  The PRAVDA newspaper features an article outlining theses of 
the Russian Communist Party central committee for drafting its 
programme under the headline "new socialism for Russia". 
  "The crisis of Soviet society," the article says, "was 
largely preconditioned by the crisis of the communist party of 
the Soviet Union which was the ruling party for decades".

<F P=106> [Interview With Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich </F>
by Mayak correspondent Yuliy Semenov on 23 March -- place not 
given; From the "Panorama" program] 
  [Text] [Semenov] Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, to what extent do 
you see a settlement of financial and economic relations with 
Russia as a way out of Belarus's economic crisis? 
  [Kebich] I think that not only Belarus, but also Russia and 
the other CIS countries should, within the framework of an 
economic union above all, allow the free movement of goods. 
There are enough borders, enough customs services, and enough 
queues on the borders. Nevertheless, all those engaged in 
smuggling are in one way or another getting their goods through. 
We think, therefore, that the treaty that is due to be signed 
between Russia and the Republic of Belarus will to all extents 
and purposes be a treaty within the framework of an CIS economic 
union. Here we are in no way against such an economic union. 
  [Semenov] Nevertheless, as far as I am aware, the talks are 
proceeding fairly slowly, although they are under way. What is 
your assessment of their progress at this moment of time? 
  [Kebich] Although an optimist, I have been becoming of late 
a 
somewhat superstitious person. Therefore, I should like to 
touch wood and say that this union will nevertheless come about. 
There are more people who see a benefit in this union than 
people opposing it. This does not demand a lot of thought. In 
this matter common sense shows, to take the example of Europe, 
that the way to rescue one's economy or improve one's economic 
state lies first and foremost in integration. We have already, 
so to speak, been through a phase of disintegration, when we 
have been breaking off all kinds of economic links. Just see 
now how in one way or another all politicians are beginning to 
be more sober in their judgements on this issue. Ukraine too is 
displaying a serious approach to this union. 
  [Semenov] There is talk that it is a matter of reviving the 
USSR in a new garb. 
  [Kebich] Not at all. It would be impossible now to revive 
it, even, forgive me, by employing forcible methods. It would 
be simply impossible for us to go back to the former set-up. I 
regard such ideas as simply ridiculous. 
  [Semenov] You are indeed an ardent propagandist of the idea 
that the problem of energy resources be tackled on equal terms 
for Russian and Belarusian customers, if such a union is agreed 
upon. Is that not so? 
  [Kebich] Yes, it is, but in general I do not see the issue 
as, say, Russian fuel and energy prices being low and fuel and 
energy prices for Belarus high. I am in favor of closer prices. 
  [Semenov] In favor of them drawing closer to world prices? 
  [Kebich] Certainly. I think that this will most likely occur 
within the next 18 months, no later. 
  [Semenov] And now a final question: It is now clear that the 
day and hour when Belarus will get its first president is not 
far off, and you are being named as one of the politicians who 
are morally entitled to stand for the presidency. Could you, to 
some extent, now define your position in this regard? If you 
intend to stand, under what banner and relying on whom will you 
set about the elections? 
  [Kebich] A law on presidential elections has not yet been 
adopted. I am not entitled at the present time to say that I 
would be a presidential candidate, until a law on presidential 
elections is in existence. However, if I had occasion to stand 
as a presidential candidate, I would nevertheless give top 
priority to economic links with the CIS countries and with the 
great Russian people, who are close to us spiritually, while, of 
course, still observing the statehood of the Republic of 
Belarus.

  [Text] The withdrawal of Russia's strategic missile forces 
deployed in Belarus has already begun. This relates to the 
Mazyr and Lida missile divisions composed of eight missile 
regiments equipped with 72 launching facilities. The divisions 
are armed with the portable ground-based missile systems RS-12M 
and Topal. 
  In 1993, one missile regiment was withdrawn from Pastawy, 
Vitsebsk Oblast, to Russia. In 1994, another four regiments 
with 36 launching facilities will be withdrawn from Belarus. 
The last regiments will be pulled out in 1995. In 1996, the 
Mazyr and Lida divisions will cease to exist.

<F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova: "Moldova: Postelection </F>
Gossip"] 
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- The final results of the 
elections in Moldova have still not been finalized, but the time 
for conflicting assessments has come. In an interview for a 
WASHINGTON POST correspondent, Moldovan President Mircea Snegur 
expressed satisfaction with the elections. In his opinion, they 
were democratic in character. He cited foreign observers in 
this assessment. Snegur called the Agrarian Democratic Party, 
which polled the majority of the votes, a centrist party. Its 
opponents, he believes, have no evidence to suggest that the 
agrarians' success will lead to a change of political course. 
  As for the bloc formed by the Socialist Path and the "Unity" 
movement, which came second to the Agrarians, Snegur noted that 
such is the reality and that deputies of this political 
orientation can conduct reforms. 
  The president hopes that the emergence of a parliamentary 
majority will make it possible to resolve the problems of 
Moldova's eastern regions. The CSCE mission under Russian 
mediation will help to achieve that goal, he believes. However, 
Snegur explained that he has in mind a democratic Russia headed 
by President Yeltsin. If the nationalists try to encroach on 
Moldova's independence and sovereignty, he noted, the country 
will not be alone because it is a member of many international 
organizations, which will come to its aid. The president of 
Moldova firmly advocated the withdrawal of Russia's 14th Army. 
  In these first few days after the elections, Snegur has 
stated that within a month Moldova will join NATO's "Partnership 
for Peace" program, which in his opinion, offers real solutions 
to avert the conflicts that threaten Europe. 
  The losers in the elections are less optimistic in their 
assessment. For example, A. Arseni, chairman of the Democratic 
Labor Party, believes that the influence of state organs was 
evident during the elections and their results showed that the 
voters depend to a large extent on the leadership in the local 
organs. Furthermore, he believes, the population was 
disoriented by the idea of reunification with Romania. 
  V. Puskasu, leader of the Republican Party and vice chairman 
of the former parliament, said that he does not regard the 
elections as a tragedy. In his opinion, it is bewildering that 
the majority of electors voted for the Agrarian Democratic Party 
while only 1 percent voted for the Republican Party, even though 
the two parties' have similar aims and programs. 
  Puskasu believes it quite possible that the new parliament, 
like its predecessor, will be forced to resign before its term 
has expired. In view of this, the Republican Party intends to 
work for the future in the belief that the new election cycle 
has already begun. 
  But V. Cheshuyev, representative of the defeated Social 
Democratic Party and director of the privatization department, 
who, during the election campaign, entered into a polemic with 
Premier A. Sangheli, his immediate superior, has resigned 
because he considers that he cannot remain in his post any 
longer. 
  The final results are still not available, but there has 
been 
another statement from the Central Electoral Commission, which 
is protesting against the mass media, which are using the 
preliminary figures without citing specific sources. The 
Central Electoral Commission is critical of the Mayak Radio 
station and Ostankino TV company in particular, but a date for 
publishing the final results has still not been announced.

the sociologic poll, which demonstrate the "triumph of reason," 
says the declaration of the Movement published today in

MPPM is concerned that "although the frontist-unionist ideology 
and political formations have suffered a total failure, their 
adepts, hidden in ministries and academies, in structures of the 
National Radio and Television, public education and culture, in 
rightist newspapers, in the leadership of the Writers' Union, 
continue to mislead the people." They corrupt the faith of the 
young generation in the specificity of the Moldovan people and 
its culture, they impose by all means the concept of Romanism of 
the Moldovans, the declaration asserts. Its authors claim that 
supporters of unionism want to transform Bessarabia, according 
to the model of 1918, into a province of Grand Romania.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F>
by an ELTA correspondent in Warsaw; date not given: "A New 
Stage in Relations"] 
  [Text] [ELTA]Mister Minister, the initialing of the 
Lithuanian-Polish treaty is scheduled to take place on 18 March 
in Warsaw. How do you assess this fact? 
  [Olechowski] It is very important that negotiations on the 
bilateral treaty are over. It will be possible not only to 
begin a new stage in Lithuanian-Polish relations but also to 
remove the last formal obstacle hampering Poland's active 
foreign policy toward its Eastern neighbors. Lithuania is the 
only neighbor with whom we have no principal document signed. I 
will remind everyone that Poland began to draft the treaty in 
March 1992 -- exactly two years ago. However, the problem of 
disbanding the self-governments in Vilnius and Salcininkay 
regions, mostly populated by the Poles, arose then. We submitted 
our draft treaty to Lithuania on 13 January 1993, while the 
Lithuanians presented their version last June. It is then that 
the true negotiations began. 
  [ELTA]Thus far, the contents of the treaty have 
remained unknown. However, there are people both in Lithuania 
and Poland who criticize this document. Some of them are 
dissatisfied with the absence of General L. Zeligowski's name in 
the treaty, while others -- with the fact that the treaty does 
not protect the rights of the Polish minority in Lithuania. 
What is your view? 
  [Olechowski] I have also heard different opinions. Speaking 
about the mention of General L. Zeligowski's name in the treaty, 
Poland has consistently opposed the assessment of historical 
events. We believe that the complicated historical relations 
between Lithuania and Poland must be a matter of research and 
disputes of professional historians. The treaty is an 
interstate document. It must serve as the basis for developing 
our relations. These are two different issues that must not be 
confused. 
  Protecting the rights of our ethnic minorities, we followed 
this principle -- to seek the integration of the Polish minority 
as Lithuanian citizens by preserving the cultural and linguistic 
autonomy and respecting minority rights. I am convinced that 
emotions over the secrecy of the text will subside after the 
treaty is publicized, and the text will be analyzed calmly. 
  [ELTA]Lithuania is the last country among Poland's 
neighbors with which the latter has no interstate agreement 
signed. One Polish social figure has said that Lithuania is the 
key to Poland's Eastern policy, while Ukraine is its foundation. 
Do you share this opinion? 
  [Olechowski] Both states play an important role in Poland's 
Eastern policy, because they, as Russia and Belarus, are our 
neighbors. Poland is interested in their political stability 
and in consistent changes that bring them closer to European 
structures. We hope that Poland's cooperation with Lithuania and 
Ukraine will develop further in the "Partnership for Peace" 
program. 
  [ELTA]What are the key trends of your Eastern 
policy? 
  [Olechowski] Seeking a successful execution of its foreign 
policy, Poland must stress the key priorities. For well-known 
reasons, these are primarily our relations with neighbors. Our 
Eastern policy must focus on three principal directions: To 
expand political and economic contacts with Russia and Ukraine, 
as well as with Belarus, Moldova, and Kazakhstan; to seek 
political and military stability in the region; and to upgrade 
the application of possibilities for economic cooperation. 
  [ELTA]What will the first moves be after signing the 
Lithuanian-Polish interstate treaty? 
  [Olechowski] First of all, we must make our economic 
relations more intensive. To this aim, we would like to hold a 
roundtable meeting soon and discuss economic issues. We expect 
mutual benefit from this. 
  We will also seek to resolve specific problems between our 
two countries. I would ascribe the registration of the Polish 
Home Army Veterans' Club in Lithuania as one of the most 
important issues. Moreover, we must clear up the problems 
concerning the property of Polish prewar social organizations in 
Vilnius. 
  [ELTA]Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] Kazys Bobelis, member of the Lithuanian Seimas 
delegation in the Council of Europe [CE] was against privileges 
for Russia in admitting it to that international organization. 
  At a meeting of the Human Rights Committee of the Council of 
Europe in Paris last week, Bobelis, together with many 
representatives of other countries, voted against the initiative 
of Great Britain to admit Russia without some essential 
preliminary conditions. According to the Lithuanian 
representative, Russia's admission to the Council of Europe is 
so far being hindered for several reasons, the most important of 
them being the deployment of the Army in foreign countries. 
  At the meeting of the committee, Bobelis, together with the 
Romanian, Polish, and Turkish representatives, did not support 
the Swedish initiative to abolish the death sentence in all 
states of the European Council. Although, according to him, 
Lithuania does not have an official policy on this issue, in his 
opinion, it is too early for the Lithuanians to assume such 
responsibility. 
  Bobelis, who is chairman of the Seimas Foreign Affairs 
Committee, complained at a news conference on Friday [25 March] 
of poor relations with the foreign policy planners at the 
presidential office. He stated that the Foreign Affairs 
Committee was not supporting the policy of Justas Paleckis, the 
presidential adviser on foreign policy. He called this policy 
isolationist.

terms of Russian automobile transit through Lithuanian 
territory, said members of a Lithuanian working group, headed by 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vladislovas Domarkas. 
  Yuri Matochkin, head of the region's administration, 
suggested to simplify transit document regulations to firms and 
organizations that would be vouched for by the Kaliningrad 
administration. The Lithuanian side accepted the proposal. 
  Lithuania and the region also agreed to put off for three 
months the introduction of Lithuanian visas for Kaliningrad 
residents because the region is technically unprepared to make 
special passport inserts for travel through Lithuanian territory.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 36 (526) </F>
compiled by Sergey Logachev, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by 
Vladimir Shishlikn] 
  [Text] Parliament speaker Ceslovas Jursenas believes that 
though there is progress in the relationships between Lithuania 
and Russia, they are too slow. Addressing in Vilnius a news 
conference he said that the withdrawal from Lithuania of the 
Russian troops and the signing of the trade and economic 
agreements helped develop bilateral cooperation. Jursenas 
voiced regret that some agreements signed by prime ministers, 
including those on bilateral trade, are not being implemented. 
  The speaker believes that the two sides should not only 
comply with the documents, they should more dynamically discuss 
the urgent problems. He believes the delay in solving some 
problems may play into the hands of the politicians who are 
trying hard to present Russia as the main source of threats and 
dangers. 
  Speaking about the internal situation in Lithuania, Jursenas 
said that it was stabilizing and this year there are chances to 
improve it. 
  However, the prospect for stabilization of the domestic 
situation, said the speaker, do not suit the interests of the 
extreme right-wing opposition, which does all it can to put 
Lithuania into a distress situation. 
  The speaker reminded about the abortive strike declared by 
farmers ten days ago. 
  Jursenas described as an attempt to deteriorate the 
political 
atmosphere the recent call by four opposition factions in 
parliament to hold a referendum on early elections, "no doubt, 
these attempts will be futile and the parliament will work until 
its powers expire in the autumn of 1996.

  [Text] The Swedish Embassy in Vilnius has assured that its 
government does not stop technical assistance to the Ignalina 
nuclear power station. 
  According the embassy statement made public today, 
information published recently in the Lithuanian mass 
information media might create an impression that Sweden was 
stopping its entire assistance to the Ignalina nuclear power 
station because of legal problems with Belarus. This is not 
true. 
  According to the statement by the Swedish Embassy, the 
Swedish Government has allocated about 120 million Swedish 
kroner to finance 20 various projects linked with the Ignalina 
nuclear power station. Nineteen of these projects are not 
influenced by the fact that Belarus has so far failed to sign 
the Vienna convention on responsibility for nuclear accidents 
and pass corresponding laws. The project influenced by the 
Belarusian stance is valued at about 10 million Swedish kroner. 
The Swedish Embassy hopes that Belarus will eliminate legal 
obstacles and this project, important to the reactor, will be 
soon fulfilled.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 25, BNS -- Attempts are made to 
transform a simple crime into politics, MP [member of 
parliament] Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the Lithuanian 
parliament's National Security Committee, said about the arrest 
of a Lithuanian businessman whose company built houses for the 
Russian military in the Kaliningrad region. 
  Vladas Laurinavicius, president of the Kaunas-based Selma 
association, was arrested last week when over 40 searches were 
carried out in apartments of former and present Defense Ministry 
employees. Officials said the measure was taken to further 
investigate the purchase of weapons for Lithuania's defense 
forces in 1992-93. 
  "There is and will be no influence on the troop withdrawal 
from Latvia and Estonia, or construction work in Kaliningrad. 
State affairs must not be mixed with personal matters," 
Petkevicius said at a press conference Thursday [24 March]. 
  The lawmaker emphasized that Selma is not a Lithuanian 
organization since last September, and law experts will have to 
find out how the company managed to continue its existence in 
Lithuania without paying taxes. 
  In Petkevicius' opinion, the case started in the fall of 
1992 
when Lithuanian Provisional Money, also called talonas, was 
introduced instead of Soviet rubles. The lawmaker said around 2 
million rubles were then taken out to the Kaliningrad region at 
that time. He said the money was escorted by certain services 
but did not specify them. "This is investigated by the 
prosecutor's offices of both countries." 
  Petkevicius said it is necessary to find 12 million lits and 
several million dollars that disappeared in the weapons deal. 
He said the prosecutor's office established that those who 
directly participated in purchasing weapons have huge sums at 
their disposal now. 
  Petkevicius said he was surprised by ex-Defense Minister 
Audrius Butkevicius stormy reaction to Selma president's arrest, 
because the former minister is not mentioned in the 
investigation carried out by the parliament's economic crimes 
commission. 
  The lawmaker noted that various companies acted as mediators 
in the weapons deal. He mentioned a case when Russian 
helicopters, offered for 800,000 U.S. dollars per unit, were 
later purchased for 1,200,000 each, and the price difference 
went to fictitious firms. 
  Petkevicius said the Russian prosecutor's office is also 
interested in the case because "many facts available to 
Lithuanian and Russian prosecutor's offices coincide."

  [Text] On 18 March, President A. Brazauskas, along with V. 
Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas [parliament] National 
Security Committee, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius, 
and other officials, visited the former Russian Army bases and 
inspected the condition of the transferred facilities. 
  First of all, the delegation visited the Rukla base in the 
Jonava region. "There are lots of buildings, but they are used 
ineffectively," said the president. Previously, the base used 
to house 12,000 servicemen, while now there are only several 
hundred soldiers -- the first field army motorized battalion 
"Gelezinis Vilkas" [Iron Wolf]. An opinion was voiced that 
Rukla could become the key Army training base and a center for 
motorized training. The base has comfortable vacant apartments 
which could accommodate servicemen coming for training. 
  In the Panevezys region, A. Brazauskas and his accompanying 
delegation showed interest in the Pajuoste base. They discussed 
ways of better utilizing its facilities. The president said 
that it would be our key air base. 
  In the Siauliai region, the president visited the military 
airport in Zokniai.

  [Text] On Thursday [17 March] evening, Prime Minister 
Adolfas Slezevicius met with foreign mass media journalists 
accredited in Lithuania. 
  Nearly a year ago -- on 31 March -- the Seimas [parliament] 
approved the program of the sixth Lithuanian Government headed 
by A. Slezevicius. The prime minister noted that his cabinet 
was the first among the six governments to prepare its program 
and curb inflation which was 1,162 and 189 percent in 1992 and 
1993, respectively. The government will seek that the inflation 
rate does not exceed 50 percent in 1994 (4.8 and 2.9 percent in 
January and February). According to A. Slezevicius, the sixth 
government was the most resolute in liberalizing prices: About 
80 percent of all prices are regulated by the market. The 
government controls only prices for energy, transportation, and 
communications. 
  However, the key unresolved problems for the current 
government are mutual debts and settlements of enterprises and 
organizations, as well as the inefficient collection of taxes 
and work of the economic police, prevention of contraband, land 
reform and credits, the construction of the oil terminal and the 
pumped-storage electric power station in Kruonis, and the 
drafting of the national transportation program. The prime 
minister claimed that even though the criminal situation has 
stabilized, it still remains complicated. Incidentally, the 
crime rate has dropped by 17 percent over the first two months 
of this year against the same period of last year, and it is the 
lowest among all neighboring states.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 24, BNS -- Lithuanian Premier Adolfas 
Slezevicius announced the government's intention to increase 
electricity and gas prices to individual consumers, and also to 
raise pensions and salaries to employees of state institutions. 
  At a press conference Thursday [24 March], the premier said 
budget receipts were too small lately to increase salaries and 
pensions, however the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of 
Social Security were commissioned this week to consider 
possibilities to increase payments April 1. "The step is very 
hard in some aspects, especially considering preparations for 
the inevitable negative consequences of introducing the 
value-added tax." 
  The government increased budget salaries and pensions nine 
times in 1993 and once this year. 
  The premier said the new gas and electricity prices will 
most 
probably be introduced when the heating season ends. 
  Slezevicius said electricity prices must be increased 
because 
the Ignalina nuclear power plant has to use much more expensive 
nuclear fuel cartridges. One cartridge costs 60,000 U.S. 
dollars and the plant needs 90 million dollars a year, he said. 
Slezevicius said electricity prices remained stabile for nearly 
a year. In his words, electricity bills now make up only an 
insignificant part of an average family budget. 
  The press conference that Slezevicius attended was devoted 
to 
a continuing political dispute over the appointment of Vytautas 
Skuodis to head the Lithuanian genocide investigation center. 
  The premier said he will "initiate" an investigation of 
facts 
suggesting that documents were stolen from the former KGB 
building in Vilnius in 1991-1992. "This of course should have 
been done earlier, but it is better to do it now than never."

  [Text] A constituent congress of Lithuanian left wingers is 
taking place in Vilnius today. What kind of movement this is 
and what are its aims? Here is an interview with one of its 
leaders, Albinas Visockas. 
  [Begin recording] [Visockas] After the Landsbergis group was 
removed from power by the Lithuanian nation and the Democratic 
Labor Party [DLP] came to power we pinned great hopes on the 
future. Unfortunately, not all our hopes have been justified. A 
group of people, including former members of the DLP and 
non-party people, decided that it was essential to form a new, 
resolute, left-wing, workers' party that would represent the 
strata of the population most frustrated in the material sense. 
After a year of preparation, we have today a constituent 
congress of such a resolute, left-wing, workers' party. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] But to recall our recent past, 
the communists maintained that they represented the interests of 
the workers -- above all, the interests of the working class and 
peasants. May it not happen that you will follow the same path? 
  [Visockas] Of course, but the difference is that this time 
the initiative came from below, that is, among the initiators of 
this party are workers, unemployed, tractor drivers, housewives, 
and other strata of the population who possess very little. 
  [Correspondent] What social group do you yourself represent? 
  [Visockas] I am a worker, although I have higher education. 
I consider that this was the fate of many people in Lithuania 
after competent and professional persons were removed from all 
offices and institutions by the Landsbergis group. There are 
such people. I am a worker, my comrades are also -- some of 
them are night watchmen, some of them cleaners, etc. But we are 
very glad that we have managed to acquire the initial rather 
large intellectual potential, that is, there are doctors of 
sciences, professors, candidates of sciences, lecturers in our 
party. Thus there is a good basis for the formation of the 
party. 
  [Correspondent] Do you intend to cooperate with other 
parties 
in Lithuania, including such public movements as the Workers' 
Union? 
  [Visockas] Yes, we intend to cooperate with all parties and 
movements that will not look down at us, that wish to cooperate, 
but we are not going to be subserviant. We have no inferiority 
complex. We do not feel any guilt, we are equal to other 
political parties and movements in Lithuania. 
  [Correspondent] Your movement or party is of a socialist 
orientation? 
  [Visockas] Yes. 
  [Correspondent] How many persons holding the same views as 
you are there? 
  [Visockas} I can say exactly. We have 429 party members. 
But they are those who have decided. Those who will decide 
after the congress and in the following months, I think that 
there will be very many of them. [end recording]

  [Text] Riga, Mar 25, BNS -- The Latvian Government's 
working party will soon finish work at proposals for 
participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, said 
Justice Minister Egils Levits, who heads the group. 
  The Defense Ministry's specialists have completed the 
military part of the document which provides to near the 
structure of the Latvian Army and the Home Guard to NATO 
standards. 
  Latvia also wants to send the National Armed Forces to joint 
excercises of NATO countries. 
  The Foreign Ministry officials are still working at the 
political part of the document which outlines consultations 
between Latvia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
  This part of the plan focuses on consultations in case 
Latvia 
faces foreign threat, said Levits. 
  Latvia wishes to feel the political presence of NATO in the 
Baltic region. Consequently, the proposals forsee to open a 
NATO information bureau in Latvia. 
  The working party will discuss the document with Danish 
Ambassador Kirsten Mallin Biering, who is also NATO's 
representative in Latvia, before sending it to Brussels. 
  The Defense Ministry also pledges to soon unveil 
calculations 
on the costs of participating in the NATO partner plan, Levits 
said. 
  As reported, the 16-nation alliance adopted the Partnership 
for Peace program during its Jan. 11 summit in Brussels. The 
program entitles the former Warsaw pact foes to receive military 
and political consulations. It could also become an avenue to 
eventual, but not obligatory, NATO membership of East European 
and former Soviet countries. Latvia signed up to the program 
Feb. 14. 
  Latvia plans to become member of the European Union around 
the year 2000. Consequently, Latvia could gain NATO membership 
a little later, Levits prognosticated.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 25, BNS -- A Latvian Government 
delegation toured Central Asian countries March 9-23 and signed 
a series of trade cooperation protocols for 1994, said Aivars 
Gulbis, a spokesman for the Economics Ministry. 
  Earlier, Latvia concluded interstate trade agreements with 
Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan which provide that 
concrete yearly supplies are coordinated by annual protocols. 
The procedure is needed because the Central Asian countries 
still practice Soviet-era system of cetralized distribution of 
material resources. 
  Under the protocols, Tajikistan will send Latvia aluminium, 
cotton, tobacco and chemicals while Latvia will deliver radio 
and telephone apparatuses and other consumer goods, said Gulbis. 
  Turkmenistan will supply the Baltic country with cotton, 
wool 
and vegetable oil and receive Latvian mini buses, machinery, 
consumer goods and food stuffs. 
  Latvia will also buy Uzbek metal alloys, zinc and metal 
working facilities. The Uzbek Government plans to increase its 
exports through Latvian ports. 
  In 1993, Latvia's export to Uzbekistan was 0.86 percent of 
the total exports while Uzbek import made up 0.11 percent of the 
total Latvian imports. The Latvian trade balance with 
Turkmenistan was 1.16 percent in export and 0.09 in import, with 
Tajikistan -- 0.15 percent in export and 0.05 percent in import.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 25, BNS -- Persecution of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party [RLDP] representative in Estonia Pyotr 
Rozhok may put Estonia's statehood in peril, says RLDP leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. 
  Zhirinovskiy yesterday sent a letter to Estonian Ambassador 
to Russia Juri Kahn stating that "coercive measures and 
provocations against the well-known Russian defender of the law 
and RLDP activist" Pyotr Rozhok may bring about "unforeseen 
consequences" in relations between Estonia and Russia. 
  "Estonia's statehood, gained thanks to communists, may in 
the 
troubled times of the 20th century, if Russia's interests are 
disregarded, become an ordeal for Estonia. Provocations and 
pressure are not the right key in relations with a 150-million 
nation. Let the organizers of such actions think deeply about 
the possible consequences," Zhirinovskiy said in the letter. 
  The Estonian Security Police on March 24 seized Rozhok and 
took him to psychiatric expertise. After that the police, in 
the presence of the Russian vice consul, searched Rozhok's 
apartment. They confiscated five brochures published by the RLDP 
and a manuscript intended for publication "in a Russian-language 
newspaper," Rozhok told BNS. 
  Security Police Director General Juri Pihl told BNS 
investigation of Rozhok's case will soon be completed and the 
materials turned over to the court. 
  The Security Police on March 16 filed formal charges against 
the 55-year-old Rozhok under Article 72 of the Criminal Code, 
accusing him of "fanning ethnic and political hatred." 
Addressing a meeting of the Russian Citizens' Union of Narva on 
Jan. 18, Rozhok said Lennart Meri "is, at best, the president 
of Estonians, not of Estonia," since the Russian-speaking 
population did not take part in the presidential elections. The 
same applies to the parliament, he said. In an interview to the 
Russian-language newspaper published in Sillamae, Rozhok claimed 
Estonia is an ancient Russian territory. In Rozhok's opinion, 
the retired Russian military living in Estonia should form armed 
units "to defend their honor and dignity" in case the 
authorities decide to deport them from Estonia.

  [Text] Tallinn, March 23 -- Estonian Defence Minister 
Indrek Kannik said that Tuesday's [22 March] decision by the 
U.S. President Mr. Clinton, opens to Estonia a wider market for 
buying defence equipment. "Restrictions on arms sales have been 
quite strong so far," he said. "Also countries that have been 
politically close to us and with whom we are cooperating closely 
for integration with Europe have not been ready to sell us 
weapons," the Defence Minister said. Estonia has only bought 
weapons from Israel, Romania and China. Minister Kannik 
expressed hope that other countries will follow the example of 
United States and lift their arms sales restrictions. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton on Tuesday lifted the embargo on arms 
sales to the three Baltic states, and to Bulgaria, Romania and 
Albania. A memorandum from the U.S. President to the 
Secretary of State says that "furnishing of defence articles and 
services to the governments of ... Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania will strengthen the security of the United States and 
promote world peace."

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 25, BNS -- Despite the fact that the 
structure of Estonia's population was purposefully changed in 
the last 50 years, Estonia and its citizens should show 
magnanimity to ethnic Russians, said British Foreign Office 
Secretary of State Douglas Hogg in an interview to the 
Tallinn-based PUHAPAEVALEHT newspaper. 
  In Hogg's opinion, non-integration of Russians into the 
Estonian society may bring about an extremely dangerous 
situation. 
  Estonia needs to map out a policy to promote the integration 
of all people who want to live here into Estonian society both 
politically and socially, Hogg said. "No society that wishes to 
remain stable can afford to keep a considerable part of the 
population deprived of political rights. This is a challenge 
which Estonia and Latvia alike face," Hogg said in the interview. 
  Commenting on the Baltic states' relations with NATO, the 
British diplomat said Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania should 
regard NATO's Partnership for Peace program as a stepping-stone 
to eventual membership in the alliance. 
  "It is impossible to say at present which nations will be 
admitted to NATO through this program, but certain states will 
definitely get the opportunity. Obviously you want to join 
NATO to avail yourself of its collective guarantees. However, 
NATO is at present not prepared to give such a guarantee, this 
is not NATO policy," Hogg said. 
  The British diplomat was skeptical about Russia's joining 
NATO. 
  "I find it very difficult to imagine how Russia could become 
a member of NATO in the near future," he said. "Russia can, of 
course, benefit from the Partnership for Peace program, which it 
hasn't signed on to yet, however." 
  Hogg considered the relations between Estonia and Great 
Britain to be very good. He affirmed that his country would 
like to see Estonia more firmly integrated into West Europe as 
its partner in free trade. 
  "A free-trade agreement may lead to Estonia's becoming a 
member of the European Union. I believe the negotiations on an 
association accord could begin already this year. However, it 
would be a mistake for the Baltic states to speed up the process 
of joining the European Union: they would come under pressure 
which their economies would be unable to withstand. After all, 
the economic regime of the union is primarily characterized by 
lack of subsidies and a free market," was Hogg's opinion. 
  Hogg was among the first high-ranking Western diplomats to 
visit Estonia after it regained its independence in 1991. 
  PUHAPAEVALEHT interviewed Hogg last week in London. The 
interview will be published in tomorrow's issue of the newspaper.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Gromak: "More Weapons: Good and Varied </F>
Ones"] 
  [Text] Ants Laaneots, chief of main staff of the Estonian 
Defense Forces, has announced that in the future the Estonian 
army will be armed mainly with Israeli weapons meeting NATO 
standards and the Kaitseliit volunteer military organization 
will be armed with Soviet-produced weapons. In the army units 
the firearms caliber will mainly be 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm. The 
7.62 mm machineguns bought in Israel will be installed on 
armored personnel carriers, the 23 mm automatic antiaircraft 
guns will be used by the air defense forces. Laaneots said that 
these guns are the only type of Estonian Army weapon which does 
not meet NATO standards: The NATO countries use 20 mm automatic 
guns. 
  Kaitseliit will be armed with 7.62 Kalashnikov assault 
rifles 
and Israeli machineguns of the same caliber. In addition 
Kaitseliit will be provided with grenade throwers. 
  The police will switch to Israeli 9 mm "Mini-Uzi" pistols 
and 
the internal defense operational battalion will receive 5.45 mm 
Kalashnikov assault rifles. The Estonian border guards will 
also be equipped in part with Israeli weapons. 
  "This distribution of weapons is temporary," Ants Laaneots, 
chief of main staff of the Estonian Defense Forces, believes. 
"It is essential to set up the supply of power structures with 
spare parts and ammunition of NATO-model weapons."

  [Text] Tallinn, March 24 -- Around 900 Russian military 
are still in the former Soviet submarine training base at 
Paldiski, Juri Tikk, the Estonian government's representative, 
told ETA on Thursday [24 March]. 
  The Russian military on Thursday handed over the list of 
officers, junior officers and servicemen stationed in Paldiski. 
The list is the basis for giving them temporary permits to stay 
in the town. 
  The registration of Russian military vehicles also started 
on 
Thursday. 
  On Tuesday, registration of local inhabitants started with 
the aim of determining the composition and number of inhabitants 
in the town largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and the 
Russian military. 
  As of Wednesday night, around 1,600 people had filled in the 
registration lists. The registration closes on Saturday. 
  On answering the question on dismantling the training 
nuclear 
reactors in Paldiski, Tikk declined some reports that the 
process was to start around April 5-7, at the time of another 
round of Estonian-Russian negotiations. He said, however, that 
the dismantling would begin in April, but the date had not been 
fixed.

the scrapping of the nuclear reactors located at the Russian 
Federation's naval training center for nuclear submarine crews 
at Paldiski [near Tallinn], as reported to ETA [Estonian 
Telegraph Agency] by the government press service. 
  The Environment Ministry must ensure that radiation levels

  [Text] Tallinn, March 22 -- While negotiations for the 
removal of Russian troops from Estonia appear to have stalled, 
negotiations for the removal of the nuclear reactor in Paldiski 
have proceeded well. The next step in the removal is the 
Estonian Government's decision to give permission for extra 
Russian military personnel to come to the former Russian naval 
base town of Paldiski for the dismantling of the two nuclear 
training reactors located there. Prime Minister Mart Laar said 
after a government meeting that the permit had been issued for 
"a small group of military." Mr. Laar said "no problems or 
obstacles" with Russia had emerged over the issue of the nuclear 
reactors' removal.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 26, BNS -- Estonian officials in 
Paldiski had by Friday [25 March] night registered 3,554 
residents of the town, special representative of the government 
in Paldiski Juri Tikk told BNS. The number allows to assume 
that most of Paldiski's civilian residents will turn up for 
registration. 
  Registration of the population began March 22 and is 
scheduled to be completed at 4 p.m. today. Tikk didn't rule out 
that the registration stations may stay open longer. 
  At present about 250 Estonian citizens and 4,000 civilian 
non-citizens live in Paldiski. Besides, an estimated 800 to 
1,000 Russian military serve there. 
  Russian military command presented the day before yesterday 
a 
list of officers and soldiers in Paldiski, which included 891 
names. Some 600 of them are permanently stationed in the town 
and are expected to leave by Aug. 31, the rest are specialists 
and technical personnel brought in to dismantle the two nuclear 
reactors at the Russian naval training base. 
  The majority of the Russian military living in Paldiski 
serve 
in the navy, but some officers of the Tallinn-based 144th 
motorized rifle division also reside in the town. Russian 
military authorities promised to present their list on March 29, 
Tikk told BNS.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Almaty 27 Mar, TASS -- President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev and his wife left for the capital of the Russian 
Federation on Sunday, one day earlier than planned, for a 
meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Nazarbayev had serious grounds to change the time of 
departure: the joint working group in charge of preparations for 
Kazakhstan-Russia summit talks failed to reach complete 
understanding on all items put on the agenda of the forthcoming 
talks. 
  Most likely, Nazarbayev wants to get acquainted with the 
sides' viewpoints on the spot to be ready to make appropriate 
political decisions and, possibly, even introduce appropriate 
adjustments to the position of his country's experts. 
  Local analysts believe that similar steps are now being 
taken 
by the Russian side as well. The two states attach paramount 
importance to maintaining and developing the historically 
established close mutual relations. Therefore, it is highly 
probable that the positions of Kazakhstan and Russia will draw 
closer together even before the two leaders hold an official 
meeting. 
  As far as differences are concerned, sources close to the 
leadership of the republic name several of them, including 
problems connected with the future of Baykonur cosmodrome, the 
conclusion of a customs union between the two countries, the 
elimination of the aftermath of the tests of nuclear weapons on 
the territory of Kazakhstan, a prolongation of the agreement to 
maintain the specialisation of defence-industry enterprises, and 
the repayment of mutual debts for the rendered services and the 
earlier supplied products.

  [Text] Some of the documents prepared for signing at the 
Russian-Kazakhstan Summit have been withdrawn from the 
discussions, a POSTFACTUM correspondent learned on 25 March from 
informed sources in the Kazakhstani Cabinet of Ministers. 
Minister Sergey Tereshchenko. [Moscow 2x2 Television in 
Russian at 1330 GMT on 26 March 1994 repeats this report adding 
the following information at this point: "The treaties on 
customs union and dealing with the consequences of nuclear 
testing at the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground have been 
withdrawn from the talks at the initiative of the Russian side, 
which also declined a protocol on extending the agreement on 
retaining specialized defense industry enterprises and a 
protocol on implementing the agreement on cooperation on 
developing fuel and energy complexes."] As POSTFACTUM learned 
from the same sources, the fate of the agreement on the status 
of the Baykonur cosmodrome is also in doubt, despite the fact 
that the Kazakhstani side has made significant concessions on 
the amount of lease payments to be made.

  [Text] Talks have been held in Pavlodar, Kazakhstan, by 
delegations of border oblasts of Kazakhstan and Russia. Here is 
our correspondent Andrey Kondrashov: 
  Delegations of four border oblasts of Kazakhstan and Russia 
took part in the talks -- Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Omsk, and 
Pavlodar. A package of economic issues was discussed. Every 
year 24 million tonnes of Ekibastuz coal are supplied to 
Siberian power stations from Kazakhstan. According to the 
Kazakhstan newspaper PANORAMA, the Russian energy sector's 
arrears reached around 80 billion rubles, 17 billion of which 
have already been paid. The remainder of the debt is to be paid 
in April. 
  Agreement was reached at the meeting to set up a joint 
Russian-Kazakh joint-stock company of the open type, founded by 
the power, coal and machine-building sectors of the two 
countries. It is intended that the draft agreement among the 
administrations of the four oblasts will be submitted to a 
forthcoming meeting of leaders and heads of state of Russia and 
Kazakhstan.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "United States-Kazakhstan: Caspian Oil </F>
Pipeline"] 
  [Text] Kadyr Baykenov, Kazakhstani minister of energy and 
fuel resources, stated this week that Kazakhstan had agreed to 
all the terms of the proposed oil transportation agreement 
between the Caspian Oil Consortium and the "Tengiz-Chevroil" 
company. 
  The agreement, an ITAR-TASS correspondent reports from New 
York, envisages allowing Kazakhstan to export crude oil lifted 
from the Tengiz and Korolevskoye Fields. Moreover, given the 
very limited throughput of Russian pipelines, Kazakhstan 
considers it expedient to rapidly complete the construction of 
pipelines for the Caspian Oil Consortium. This decision was 
confirmed at meetings in London with representatives of the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], which, 
as expected, will be financing part of the project to build the 
Caspian oil pipeline. Kazakhstan and Russia are shareholders in 
the EBRD.

  [Text] Friday morning [25 March], Russia's State Duma 
passed, by 268 votes against 10, with 4 abstensions, a formula 
for the realization of its earlier political and economic 
amnesty bill. 
  The Duma decided that criminal charges could not be dropped 
against those who in early October 1993 committed criminal 
offenses which were not part of what is known as the "Moscow 
developments" and had not yet turned sixty. 
  The Duma decided that everyone who had committed economic 
offenses before 31 December 1991, marking the formal breakup of 
the Soviet Union, were to be pardoned. 
  Also, criminal charges were to be dropped against those who 
resorted to fraud to appropriate state or public funds and 
against those who appropriated especially large sums. The Duma 
instructed courts of justice to see to it that this last 
decision is carried out.

<F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Skukin: "Red Carnation for Gaydar"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The State Duma yesterday adopted a federal law 
whose importance is truly hard to exaggerate -- "On the 
Procedure for the Publication and Coming into Force of Federal 
Constitutional Laws, Federal Laws, and Acts of the Russian 
Federation Federal Assembly Chambers." Henceforth, under 
Article 5 of this law, the publication of federal constitutional 
laws, federal laws, and acts of the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly chambers in VEDOMOSTI FEDERALNOGO SOBRANIYA ROSSIYSKOY 
FEDERATSII [Records of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly] 
and ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will be official. 
  The State Duma rapidly adopted a decree on the complex and 
largely deadlocked issue of a political settlement of 
differences with the organs of power of Chechnya. [passage 
omitted] 
  Sergey Shakhray, Russian Federation Government minister for 
nationalities affairs and regional policy, refuted the claim 
that Russia, despite everything, is feeding and will continue to 
feed Chechnya. No money was sent there in 1993, nor will any 
money be sent this year until there is a complete political 
settlement. 
  There was a very unusual episode at the very beginning of 
Friday's session. Vyacheslav Marychev, a Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia deputy known for his activeness, handed the 
chairman a red carnation for presentation to the man celebrating 
his saint's day -- Yegor Gaydar.

  [Text] Stavropol March 28 TASS -- Every seat in the 
Stavropol regional duma (legislature) was filled as a result of 
the weekend elections in the territory, ITAR-TASS was told by 
chairman of the territorial electoral commission Viktor Limanov 
when the tallying of the votes was finished. 
  Sceptics' forecasts were not proved false as an average of 
40 
per cent of registered Stavropol voters turned out for the 
secret balloting in the territory's 25 districts. 
  According to the preliminary results, the overwhelming 
majority of voters preferred those who had already had 
experience in running the territory's complicated economy and in 
implementing Russian reforms. The electoral mandate was won by 
almost all of the municipal and regional administration heads 
and law enforcement officials who nominated themselves as 
candidates to the territorial duma. 
  Neither the pro-reform Russia's Choice bloc nor the other 
social movements and political parties were able to gather 
enough votes to put one of their followers in the local duma, 
with the exception of a very few cases. 
  Bryansk -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Artyushin: 
  The preliminary results of the elections to the Bryansk 
regional duma are in. ITAR-TASS was told by the regional 
administration's working group that the elections were valid in 
six of the nine three-seat constituencies, resulting in the 
election of 18 of the 27 duma deputies. Despite that fact that 
the 27 spots were contested by 151 candidates, low voter turnout 
in the other three constituencies disqualified those elections. 
  Of the 18 new deputies in the regional duma, five are high 
officials in the regional administration, being the deputy head, 
the heads of the regional departments of internal affairs, 
agriculture, and labor and unemployment, as well as the chairman 
of the department of the regional consumer's union. 
  Five local administration heads and their deputies also got 
seats in the duma, along with three collective farm chairmen, 
two industrialists, a teacher, a doctor, and an agronomist. 
  Cheboksary -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentina Ivanova: 
  The voter turnout in Chuvashia's second round of local 
elections, held on Sunday, was around 40 per cent, ITAR-TASS was 
informed by the Central Electoral Commission. The names of 28 
of the 47 deputies in the State Council were determined, while 
the remaining 19 seats are still vacant. 
  Samara -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Belyakov: 
  Of the 25 deputy mandates in the Samara gubernatorial duma, 
only 14 were filled as a result of Sunday's local elections. 
The other 11 districts were plagued by very low voter turnout, 
and the elections were declared invalid. Overall, of the 
region's 2.5 [as published] registered voters, a little more 
than 30 per cent showed up at the polls.

  [Text] Ryazan [no date as received] -- According to the 
results of the March 27 elections to local representative 
authorities in the Ryazan region, summed up today, only 12 out 
of the needed 19 deputies to the regional duma have been 
elected. Elections were recognised as valid in all the rural 
constituencies, while the minimum turnout of 35 per cent was not 
registered at any of the constituencies in the city or Ryazan 
itself. This is why only one deputy to the regional duma was 
elected there. 
  According to the current regulations, repeated elections may 
be held there no sooner that in three months. So far as the 
future of the regional duma is concerned, a final decision will 
be taken by the regional electoral commission today after the 
final count of votes. The decision will hardly be positive, 
because one more deputy is needed to make the quorum. 
  Nizhniy Novgorod -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Evald 
Kessariysky: 
  The results of elections to the representative bodies of 
power were rather promising in that region. An average of 32 
per cent of electors took part in the voting. 32 deputies were 
elected to the regional legislative assembly, and repeated 
elections will be held in 13 constituencies. 
  The turnout was rather high in the city of Nizhniy Novgorod. 
According to preliminary results, 25 deputies were elected 
there. Repeated elections will be held in nine constituencies. 
  Tambov -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Russkiy: 
  Elections have been recognised as valid in the Tambov region 
with a population of 1.5 million, Chairman of the Regional 
Electoral Commission Nikolay Vorobev told ITAR-TASS. 43.3 per 
cent of electors took part in the voting. Thirty deputies were 
elected to the regional duma and 16 deputies -- to the city 
duma. A Tambov mayor was also elected for the first time ever. 
According to the preliminary information, the incumbent mayor 
of Tambov Valeriy Koval, 42, leader of local democrats, was 
elected to that post. He defeated a candidate from Rutskoy's 
party and a representative of communists. 
  Voronezh -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Starukhin: 
  Residents of the Voronezh region, and especially urban 
dwellers, did not show much enthusiasm about the Sunday 
elections to local representative bodies of power. According to 
preliminary results, only 23 per cent of electors took part in 
elections to the Voronezh municipal council, and elections can 
be recognised as valid only in seven constituencies out of 17. 
Turnout was a little higher during the elections to the 
regional duma, because residents of rural areas took part in 
them. A total figure is 42 per cent. However, the needed 
minimum was not reached at ten urban constituencies, and 
repeated elections will have to be held there. Elections seem 
to be valid in the remaining 35 constituencies, mostly in rural 
areas.

  [Text] Moscow, 26 Mar -- The press service of the Russian 
president has reported that in keeping with part two of Article 
85 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin today issued an edict suspending the 22 
February 1994 resolution issued by the Krasnoyarsk Kray 
administration "On the Referendum on the Draft Law of 
Krasnoyarsk Kray `On the Fundamentals of Direct Democracy and of 
the Structure of State Power in Krasnoyarsk Kray.'" 
  The edict notes that the inclusion of the draft law, which 
determines the kray's status, in the kray referendum violates 
Article 10, part two of Article 66 and part one of Article 77 of 
the Constitution of the Russian Federation.

  [Text] In Friday's interview with Interfax Chechnya's 
Secretary of State Aslambek Akbulatov said Chechnya was ready to 
sign a treaty with the Russian Federation on the condition that 
it was recognized as a sovereign state. The Chechen republic 
attached no other conditions to the conclusion of a treaty with 
Russia. 
  If it were suggested, as a preliminary condition, that 
Chechnya be regarded as a constituent part of the Russian 
Federation, it would make no sense for Groznyy to send a 
delegation to Moscow, said Akbulatov. 
  He continued that, detrimental as they were to the Russian 
interests, the political games around Chechnya would inevitably 
produce a new Russian-Caucasian war, and claimed that President 
Dudayev was concerned exactly about that possibility. 
  Akbulatov dismissed, as an obvious journalistic error, 
reports that the Moscow-based negotiations had been broken-off 
and the Chechens were to blame for it. He said the negotiations 
were continuing and no chance would be overlooked for a 
reasonable compromise. The Chechen and Russian delegations were 
to meet again on Saturday, March 26. 
  Chechnya was seeking the closest and neighborly relationship 
with Russia, said Akbulatov, with sovereignty as a safeguard 
against the possible repetition of an attempt to exterminate the 
Chechens.

  [Text] Baku (March 24) TURAN--Today Azerbaijan's Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs sent the note to Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. Azerbaijan makes a protest due to illegal arrival of 
Deputy of the Russian Duma, Nikolay Lysenko, in Khankendi 
[Stepanakert] and his statements which are aimed against 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. "Such 
statements of Russian Deputy can spoil Azerbaijani-Russian 
relations", says the document. 
  The leader of the Russian National-Republican Party, Nikolai 
Lysenko, said on March 18 in Yerevan that "Russia must recognize 
Nagorno-Karabakh republic". He added that "Nagorno-Karabakh has 
the right to exist as a sovereign republic. Azerbaijan's 
aggression against Karabakh would have been impossible if Turkey 
did not back it. Russia, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh have 
common geostrategic interests".

<F P=106> [Commentary by Qulu Meherremov] </F>
  [Text] The West has considered Deputy Defense Minister 
Kondratyev's statement that Moscow is prepared to deploy 
Russia's peacekeeping units in adjacent territory from various 
angles. Several political commentators have assessed Russia's 
policy on using force as the beginning of a new cold war and a 
wave of military pressure directed on the former Soviet Union, 
particularly the republics in the Caucasus. 
  The statement was not a new development in Russia's policy 
of 
strengthening its military presence in the CIS republics. But 
Kondratyev's statement indicated that Russia has ignored the 
international community's opinion and challenged international 
norms. That was a new and undesirable factor in his statement. 
  Undoubtedly, one of the reasons Russia moved to use force is 
the radical political developments in that country. Another is 
Russia's failure to realize its views on international and 
regional developments during the past few years. 
  Russia tried to find a legal solution to two problems in the 
international arena until as recently as yesterday. It called 
for international status for the MDB [not further identified], 
as in the case of the CSCE. It will be recalled that Moscow has 
an influential position in the MDB. Russia called on the world 
to agree to the deployment of its military forces in the 
troubled areas in the former Soviet Union as peacekeeping units. 
But the international community has rejected its proposals on 
the grounds that they conflicted with international norms. 
Consequently, Russia now seems to have abandoned its diplomatic 
initiatives and adopted a different policy. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Kondratyev's statement has revealed 
a 
sharp turn in Russia's policy. Naturally, that has created 
several questions in people's minds. Why does Russia, which has 
deployed military units in several republics on the bases of 
bilateral agreements, insist on giving the status of a 
peacekeeping force to two of its divisions? 
  That aspect promised nothing favorable for Azerbaijan. 
Russia has no military troops in Azerbaijan and Baku does not 
wish to allow any to be deployed in the Republic. Everyone 
knows that Russia covertly directs pressure on the sides 
involved in the Karabakh problem. Apparently, the deployment 
of its military units in the region as a peacekeeping force will 
create a favorable opportunity for it--politically and 
legally--to direct pressure on the sides without having to 
conceal it. 
  Azerbaijan's political leaders have often stated that they 
oppose the deployment of Russia's troops in the disputed region 
under any title. They believe that the Russian troops will most 
probably be based between the warring sides, that is, in 
Karabakh. But that will make the dispute worse. Undoubtedly, 
the move will prolong the dispute indefinitely and create an 
undesirable situation for Azerbaijan. 
  Despite its assuring but misleading aspects, the deployment 
of Russia's military forces in the region in the form of a 
peacekeeping force could place Azerbaijan in an unfavorable 
political and military situation. 
  Regarding Kondratyev's fearful statement, REUTER has quoted 
Western observers as saying that the effort made to realize its 
stipulations will, undoubtedly, create a clash between the 
Western world and Russia, which is already in a difficult 
situation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Sahib Aliyev] </F>
  [Text] It was week ago that the Iranian C-130 was shot 
down. Despite the passage of a considerable time, the causes of 
this incident still remain a mystery, and two questions arise 
from this mystery. First, why, like the act of terrorism 
committed in the Baku metro, did this incident take place on the 
eve of Novruz? Second, what is the aim behind the dissemination 
of reports by the Russian and Armenian mass media that the plane 
crashed due to supposedly technical faults? 
  And this despite the fact that, just a day after this 
incident, authoritative sources in Azerbaijan, citing 
indisputable facts, announced that the plane was shot down. 
  Leaving aside this statement by the Azerbaijani side, an 
Iranian expert visiting the scene of the incident two days ago 
also confirmed that it was shot down. 
  And contrary to the Armenian claims, the Iranian side also 
announced that the plane was not off course, but was forced to 
fly at low altitude because strong pressure caused cracks on its 
windows. 
  In short, it is a fact that the plane was hit. It should be 
kept in mind that apparently it was shot down by those who have 
tried to link this incident to technical problems or weather 
conditions; that is, by the Armenians. 
  Many ascribe Iran's failure to react strongly to this 
incident to its unwillingness to harm its warm ties with Armenia. 
  In our view, Iran is waiting for the completion of the 
formal 
investigation; and one of the strongest states in the region 
cannot remain indifferent to such a tragic death of 32 of its 
citizens, because if such indifference is observed in the 
Iranian Islamic Republic, which passes itself off as the ardent 
supporter of Moslems and Islam in the world, it might create, at 
the very least, disappointment among the Islamic population of 
the former USSR, and trust in it might be shaken.

  [Text] Baku (March 26) TURAN--Azerbaijan is deeply 
concerned about the reactivation of Armenia's electrical power 
station, reports a statement from the press service of the 
Presidential Cabinet. 
  "Reactivating the atomic electric power station in Armenia 
is 
dangerous for Azerbaijan especially since a war is being waged 
between the two countries. There is no doubt that Armenia will 
use the nuclear materials for military purposes which violates 
international norms. It is also dangerous for ecology", says 
the document. 
  The statement further reads that in this context, the Azeri 
government calls upon the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to consider the power plant's reactivation; ecological, 
military and political consequences of this step should be 
thoroughly examined and Armenia must observe its obligations of 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

  [Text] Baku March 28 TASS -- Azerbaijani troops rebuffed an 
Armenian offensive in the direction of Agdam in the disputed 
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh on Monday, the Azerbaijani Defence 
Ministry said. 
  The Armenians had to retreat, sustaining heavy losses, from 
two villages they had seized earlier -- Shirvanly and 
Garagashly. Fighting is now continuing ten kilometers northeast 
of Agdam. 
  The ministry said that the enemy continued shelling villages 
in northwestern Azerbaijan. 
  In a separate report, the press centre of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh defence army said earlier today that heavy 
fighting continued throughout last night and most of the day on 
Monday after Azerbaijani troops launched an offensive in the 
direction of Agdam. 
  The press centre said the operation involved tanks and 
aviation. Reports from Stepanakert, capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, 
said that Karabakh fighters were repelling the attack, 
inflicting severe damage on the enemy.

  [Text] Stepanakert, March 26 (SNARK) -- After violent 
fights, calm has again settled at the Karabakh front, 
interrupted only by sporadic shots. Thus, as told SNARK the 
press-service of Karabakh Defence Army, the defenses of Armenian 
forces were shelled in the direction of Berdashen village (East 
Karabakh). So far there was no information of victims. 
  Azerbaijan's military units resumed their attacks in 
Fizulinskiy Rayon yesterday morning. They tried to retake the 
positions they lost earlier but they failed to do so. NKR's 
armed units repulsed the attacks and forced the enemy forces to 
retreat to their former positions. 
  Azerbaijan's attack aircraft dropped three heavy bombs on 
the 
NKR's defensive positions in Fizulinskiy Rayon yesterday 
morning. We have not yet received a report on the number of 
casualties. The Armenian positions in Novruzlu and Yusifdzhanly 
in Agdamskiy Rayon were fired on with machine guns on the same 
day. No other significant incident took place at the front 
lines. The NKR defense units maintain their control of the 
strategically important Omar Pass. 
  Azerbaijani Air Force units have taken an active part in the 
operations the ground forces carried out during the past two 
days. The neighboring republic's attack aircraft have bombed the 
NKR positions. According to a report we received from the NKR 
Defense Army press service a short time ago, two enemy aircraft 
dropped cluster bombs on NKR positions close to Goradiz today. 
The report said that even Azerbaijani troops were affected by 
the effects of that attack. Meanwhile, Azerbaijani aircraft 
also tried to bomb Stepanakert. However, the NKR air defense 
forces successfully blocked the attack. 
  Intensive combat operations did not take place at the front 
lines yesterday. The confrontation was in the form of 
positional fighting. Exchanges of fire took place between the 
warring sides in various parts of the front line. 
  According to NKR reconnaissance units, Azerbaijan's military 
command has maintained its effort to deploy reinforcements and 
military hardware in various parts of the confrontation areas. 
  An incident has not occurred on the border between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan from last night until 1600 this afternoon.

  [Text] Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called the 
reopening of the Armenian nuclear station "one of the most 
important tasks facing Armenia." 
  Speaking at a government meeting in the village of Metsamor 
where the station is located, the president expressed the 
opinion that the reopening of the station would enable Armenia 
to gain minimal energy independence and to avoid considerable 
losses from a transportation and energy blockade. 
  Ter-Petrosyan said that "a serious inspection at the 
international level" is to be carried out at the nuclear station 
in the near future. He said that this year the financing of 
work on the station was included in the state budget. At the 
same time, he "expects foreign aid." 
  In this connection, Ter-Petrosyan pointed to the particular 
significance of the Armenian-Russian agreement on the nuclear 
station signed in Moscow last week. "I am sure that its 
implementation will speed up the reopening of the station," he 
pointed out. 
  Armenian experts believe that the station can be launched 
into operation in a year and a half, costing about 70 million 
dollars. 
  The Armenian station was shut down due to public demand 
after 
the December 1988 earthquake in Armenia, although it was not 
damaged at that time. 
  The Armenian government confirmed the station's status as a 
special facility. 
  The government managed to find money to pay wages to the 
personnel of the station according to a special tariff network. 
From April 1 the average wages at the station will be 2,200 
drums or 20 minimal wages in Armenia. In addition, workers will 
receive 50 drums for nutrition on a daily basis. It was also 
decided to rename the station from Armenian into Metsamor.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 26 (SNARK) -- Armenian President 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan is again the most popular politician in the 
Republic. This was the comment given by Gevork Poghosyan, 
Director of the Sociological Research Center, National Academy 
of Sciences, to results of the recent poll, carried out by his 
service. He told SNARK there was a time when President was 
inferior by his rating to the Vice President Gagik Arutunyan, 
and to the former Foreign Minister Raffi Govhanesyan. But now, 
no politician in Armenia can match with his popularity. 
  "The second, and far behind, was the former Communist Leader 
of Armenia Karen Demirchyan, said the sociologist. According to 
the poll results, 9 percent of the Yerevan citizens trust the 
President completely, 31 percent partially, and 52 percent do 
not at all. Such a rating may be considered as normal, with 
account of drastic situation in Armenia", told Poghosyan. 
  In his opinion, if Levon Ter-Petrosyan nominated himself as 
a 
candidate for the new presidential elections, he would have won.

  [Text] Decree of the president of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan on measures to step up monitoring of compliance with 
tax and customs legislation in the Republic of Uzbekistan in 
order to implement measures aimed at the protection of the 
Republic's economic interests and property rights, the 
development of entrepreneurship and the implementation of a 
single state tax and customs policy: 
  1. The state taxation committee of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan should take additional measures to step up the 
monitoring of compliance with tax and customs legislation. 
  To this end, incidents of tax evasion, duties, and other 
compulsory payments on a large and especially large scale; the 
illegal export of goods and material resources from the 
Republic; and other contraventions that harm the economic 
interests of the state, must be comprehensively probed. Criminal 
prosecutions must be brought in accordance with legislation, 
investigations carried out and material relevant to 
investigations passed to the law enforcement bodies. 
  2. The Procurator's Office, the National Security Service 
and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan must organize the immediate and efficient 
investigation of crimes concerning compliance with tax and 
customs legislation, ensuring that crimes are inevitably 
punished. 
  3. The judicial bodies of the Republic should be instructed 
to ensure effective and priority examination of the 
aforementioned category of criminal cases in the courts, giving 
wide publicity via the media to sentences passed and decisions 
returned. 
  4. The procuracy of the Republic of Uzbekistan should be 
instructed to exercise effective scrutiny of the investigation 
of material passed to the law enforcement bodies by the tax and 
customs bodies and to bring in strict monitoring of the 
progress, thoroughness, quality and time-scale of the 
investigation of criminal cases arising from this material, 
ensuring the compulsory involvement of procurators in the 
hearing of these cases in the courts. 
  5. The procurator general, the chairman of the Supreme 
Court, the minister of justice and the chairman of the state 
taxation committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan must call the 
heads of tax and customs bodies, as well as town and rayon 
procurators and judges, to strict account, in accordance with 
legislation, for red tape, an easygoing attitude or lack of 
principle, as well as for breaches of the deadlines set for 
cases to be heard. 
  The heads of the above bodies should report on the progress 
of implementation of this decree and supply the government with 
the necessary information once a quarter. 
  [Signed] I. Karimov, president of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan.

relations. The government of the Republic has instructed the 
Central Bank to strictly limit credit and cash flow. [passage 
omitted] The Finance Ministry and the Central Bank must, within 
a period of one month, formulate the mechanism for the formation 
and exploitation of the gold and currency reserves of the 
Central Bank to create a stabilizing fund and provide measures 
to support the course of the national currency. Enterprises 
with all forms of ownership, including those involved in trading 
operations with states of the former union, must give 15 percent 
of their earnings to the hard currency funds of the Republic. 
Specialists consider these measures adopted by the Government 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan to be an important stage in 
preparing for the introduction of the national currency that 
will replace the current transitional sum-coupon.

  [Text] In a message to Russia's President Yeltsin, his 
Turkmen counterpart Niyazov voiced full support for the upcoming 
CIS summit's agenda, but warned that Turkmenistan would stay 
away from new CIS structures. 
  He admitted at an earlier meeting with Turkmen foreign 
ministry officials that each CIS session had been a headache for 
him, especially hearing calls for Turkmenistan's more active 
role in efforts to settle conflicts in Tajikistan and Abkhazia 
or invitations to military or economic alliances. Many leaders 
"advocate unions because they fail to cope with the difficulties 
that have cropped up after their country became independent," he 
said.

  [Text] Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] intends to start 
cooperating with NATO in the near future, according to Boris 
Shikhmuradov, the republican prime minister. Turkmenia's 
participation in the Partnership for Peace program was the 
center of attention at the talks between the Turkmenistani 
leadership and a NATO delegation in Ashkhabat [Ashgabat]. The 
talks also discussed prospects for NATO's assistance to 
Turkmenia and in particular, assistance in training personnel 
for the national armed forces.

  [Text] Turkmenian diplomats should clearly see the goals of 
the state, trust the government policy and be able to explain it 
to representatives of other countries, President Saparmurad 
Niyazov said at a meeting with Turkmenian Foreign Ministry 
officials on 26 March. 
  Niyazov pointed out that Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] will 
cooperate with Russia on an equal basis whatever the power in 
Moscow. In his opinion, Turkmenia should select five or six 
states for having close relations with them. According to 
Niyazov, all states neighboring Turkmenia can be chosen. 
  Niyazov expressed surprise that Western countries continue 
to 
accuse Turkmenia of violating human rights and democracy. He 
said that there is not a single political prisoner in the 
Republic and anybody can organize a party "with its regulations, 
program, supporters and which acts within the framework of the 
Constitution and the law." 
  "We are building an open society in which all human rights 
will be respected. Everybody can express his/her opinion, but 
when a majority takes a decision, a minority should follow," 
Niyazov said.

  [Text] On Saturday, Shukurdzhon Zukhurov, Tajikistan's 
Labor and Employment Minister and leader of the republican 
delegation at the future negotiations with the representatives 
of the opposition, refuted information stating that these 
negotiations would be held in the near term in Moscow with 
Russia's mediation. In his interview with INTERFAX, Zukhurov 
indicated that Tajikistan's official delegation is not going to 
Moscow to meet with the opposition in the near term. 
  In his words, the Tajik leadership has not received an 
invitation from another mediator at the negotiations, a special 
envoy of the UN General Secretary. In addition, members and 
leadership of the delegation are to meet with the Tajik 
leadership to concretely determine authorities and mandate of 
the delegation, he said. 
  "We shall hardly be able to work out this issues before 28 
March," said Zukhurov. He also reported that the delegation 
headed by him is ready to sit at the negotiations table with the 
opposition's delegation headed by any of its leaders." At the 
same time he said that it is unclear who will head the 
delegation and how many members will be in it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Otakhon Latifi, chairman of the board of the </F>
coordinating center of Tajikistan's democratic forces in the CIS 
countries, by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Karpov; 
place and date not given: "Opposition Is for National Accord"] 
  [Text] The Tajik problem may only be solved by political 
methods -- this is the main result of negotiations between the 
delegation of forces in opposition to the current official 
Dushanbe with the Russian MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] 
leadership, which were held under UN sponsorship in Teheran. Our 
correspondent, Aleksandr Karpov, interviews a member of the 
Tajik delegation at this meeting -- Otakhon Latifi, chairman of 
the board of the coordinating center of Tajikistan's democratic 
forces in the CIS. 
  [Karpov] Why did the negotiations process on the Tajik 
problem begin with, of all things, the opposition meeting with 
the Russian political leadership? 
  [Latifi] It is our deep conviction that negotiations with 
current Tajik authorities are impossible without first 
discussing the Russian factor. Russia, which alternately 
supported either one or the other side in the confrontation, 
found itself moving willy-nilly, directly involved in this 
conflict. Today, the official regime in Tajikistan is holding up 
only because of the presence of the Russian army, which in its 
actions transcends the boundaries of peacekeeping tasks and 
constantly interferes in the internal affairs of a sovereign 
independent state. This has been acknowledged by international 
experts, Russian analysts, and the Russian press. One of the 
important results of the meeting in Teheran is the general 
understanding that peacekeeping forces in our Republic may even 
be represented by Russia's 201st motorized rifle division, but 
on the condition that it will be authorized by the United 
Nations. 
  [Karpov] Opposition leaders' statements at various times 
often mentioned Russia's special geopolitical interests in 
Tajikistan. What specifically do they have in mind? 
  [Latifi] The economy; it is the uranium industry in 
Leninabad 
Oblast. Do not forget that the first Soviet atomic bomb was 
built using uranium ore mined around the city of Chkalovsk. Many 
among our enterprises also have direct ties with plants and 
factories in the Russian Federation. In the political sphere, 
Tajikistan has always been and remains a gate to the East for 
Russia; Russian positions in Iran, Afghanistan, and India depend 
to a considerable extent on relations with Tajikistan. Anyway, 
how can one discard ties that go back more than 200 years? 
  [Karpov] For a long time, Tajikistan's official authorities 
kept saying that they could not sit down at the negotiating 
table with the opposition, whose "hands are in blood up to the 
elbows." The opposition, in turn, maintained that they have 
nothing to discuss with a puppet government... 
  [Latifi] Most such mutual accusations are a thing of the 
past. During his latest trip to Tashkent, Emomali Rakhmonov said 
that he is willing to sit down at the negotiating table with any 
official representative of the opposition forces regardless of 
his political views. As to blood on the opposition's hands, I 
want to remind that opposition in Tajikistan had never been in 
power. Right now, however, the important point is that there is 
an opportunity to reach a sensible solution, in which there 
should be no place for ambitions. 
  [Karpov] Criminal proceedings, which are investigated by the 
Republic procuracy, have been initiated against many opposition 
leaders in Tajikistan... 
  [Latifi] One of the terms of truce is that all these 
proceedings will be terminated. 
  [Karpov] Probably the first round of negotiations between 
the 
opposition and the representatives of Tajikistan's official 
authorities will take place soon. What proposals will the 
opposition forces leaders bring to this meeting? 
  [Latifi] Tajikistan's authorities more or less control the 
situation in Dushanbe, but certainly not in the republic as a 
whole. Therefore, a period of transition to stabilization must 
be defined. During this time, in our opinion, a state council of 
national accord should be set up, which will be comprised of 
new, absolutely neutral people. Over the period of two or three 
years they will have to make a tremendous effort to return all 
refugees to the Motherland (about a million people); conduct a 
population census; disarm all -- both opposition and government 
-- illegal armed formations, and only then draft and adopt a new 
national constitution and conduct elections to the supreme 
bodies of authority. The opposition does not thirst for power. 
All we want is national accord.

  [Text] The government, at its regular meeting on 23 March, 
addressed the president with the request to postpone the 
implementation of the decree on the land reform. In particular, 
the allocation of plots of land until the end of this year's 
harvest campaign so as to not create turmoil during the field 
work. The request by the Defense Ministry to allocate them plots 
of land for farming has also been refused. Those attending the 
meeting found it reasonable if the military, instead of owing 
allotments, would cooperate with farmers and farms in the 
production of agricultural products. 
  The government's meeting, which was chaired by Abbas 
Dzhumagulov, discussed all the suggestions of the commission on 
elaborating a resolution on the urgent measures aimed at 
carrying out the republican land reform in accordance with the 
president's decree. The commission has elaborated a precise 
document that will be used as a manual by the agricultural 
sector of the economy. In particular, the Minselkhozprod (?the 
ministry of agricultural products) can only address issues 
connected with land reform, and it is also made responsible for 
it. It will cooperate with ministries and departments. The 
agricultural committees on the sites will contribute to this. 
  The document also specified tasks of educational, 
cattle-breeding, and seed farms, as well as some other issues. 
Special emphasis was paid to the role of the mass media in 
covering the land reform and ways of implementing it. The 
document is to be published in the press.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 27 Mar -- "Kazakhstan and Russia are tied by 
stable links of friendship and fraternity going back centuries," 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said in an 
interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent on his way to Moscow. 
He said: "The key factors cementing them are a common economy, 
historical and cultural traditions, and a common mentality." 
Therefore, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized, "nobody will ever 
manage to sow discord between our peoples. Although such 
attempts have already been made and are still being made by some 
irresponsible politicians." 
  "Take, for instance, the problem of dual citizenship," the 
Kazakhstan president said. "Many countries, including Russia, 
do not provide for this. So the question arises: Can this be 
introduced in Kazakhstan when it is just beginning to construct 
its statehood and when more than half of its citizens are not 
native inhabitants? This would put the republic's citizens at a 
disadvantage at the outset, dividing them into people of first 
and second class. Would it not be better for everyone to create 
equal conditions and have everything correspond to the demands 
of peaceful, world standards, and to make borders transparent by 
concluding the appropriate intergovernmental agreements? Then, 
for instance, persons wishing to move to a permanent place of 
residence in Russia would be automatically given Russian 
citizenship, and if they return to Kazakhstan, Kazakh 
citizenship would be given just as freely. If that were to 
happen, no one would ever again raise the question of the need 
for dual citizenship." 
  As to the essence of the forthcoming talks with the Russian 
Federation president, is concerned, the Kazakh chief of state 
said the main purpose of the meeting with Boris Yeltsin is to 
remove the problems which have accumulated in relations between 
the two countries. Experts have worked throughout the year on 
ways of resolving many of them and there is no doubt that mutual 
understanding will be found. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev went on to say that the first thing at 
issue will be military cooperation. He said: "We had a single 
army, a single weaponry, a single military school, and these 
ties should not be broken, especially since we are friendly 
states. In our time we have already reached a relevant 
agreement on friendship, cooperation, and military aid, and I 
think normal conditions should be created for the Russian Army 
to use the military test ranges on Kazakhstan's soil." 
  "A second problem -- Baykonur -- should also be resolved, 
Nursultan Nazarbayev continued. "This is a unique facility, the 
only one of its kind. I think that tomorrow the Russian side 
and ourselves will find mutually acceptable conditions for its 
use in the interests both of Kazakhstan and of the Russian 
Federation. 
  All unresolved problems concerning humanitarian links, 
including civilian ones, must be resolved. People's freedom of 
movement across the border must be guaranteed. Economic 
problems must also be resolved; they concern many aspects of our 
cooperation. We expect over 20 specific documents to be signed 
here. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed, in particular, that he 
personally would like matters to be conducted in such a way as 
to ensure that there are never any problems at all in the 
dialogue between Russia and Kazakhstan. The Kazakhstan 
president said the two countries are fated, "in the best sense 
of that word, to be always together. After all, the economies of 
our republics represent in many ways a single production 
mechanism. In particular, the world's biggest coalfields in 
Pavlodar Oblast send most of the fuel they mine to the Russian 
Federation. Siberia and the Far East provide Kazakhstan with 
the lion's share of its industrial timber requirements. It is 
not difficult to imagine what our countries would be deprived of 
if such reciprocal deliveries were halted. For it would take 
Russia not just tens of years, but also vast and presently 
nonexistent resources, to develop its coalfields, just as it 
would Kazakhstan to grow its forests." 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev said the exchange of opinions on the 
"situation in the Commonwealth and on ways to give it a more 
concrete and effective content will occupy an important place in 
his conversation with Boris Yeltsin. The fact of the matter is 
that all the heads of states are already saying that the 
Commonwealth is necessary, that it is a great future. At the 
same time, little is being done in practice to strengthen the 
processes of integration. One wonders how long some political 
leaders, and not just them, will continue to harbor a panicky 
fear that the empire will be revived? It has already been 
consigned to history. It's time for all to realize that fact 
once and for all and to begin restoring the economic ties which 
have been ruptured. Otherwise the economy of our countries will 
never get out of the crisis."

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Mar -- Kazakhstan President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev and his wife arrived in the capital of the Russian 
Federation today. He arrived a day earlier than expected, but 
his talks with Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin will 
begin tomorrow, as previously agreed. The Kazakh chief of state 
intends to prepare himself better for the official part of his 
visit, and he will begin the appropriate consultations as soon 
as he arrives in the Kremlin residence set aside for him. 
  On his way to Moscow, Nursultan Nazarbayev gave an exclusive

Kazakhstan and Russia are tied by stable links of friendship and 
fraternity going back centuries. The president of Kazakhstan

said, how far that succeeds depends to a large extent upon the 
situation in each of them individually and in the CIS as a whole. 
  The leader of Kazakhstan also said that the exchange of 
opinions on the situation in the CIS and on ways to give the 
Commonwealth a more concrete and effective content will occupy 
an important place in his conversation with Boris Yeltsin.

President Boris Yeltsin as he opened negotiations between 
Russian and Kazakh delegations. Earlier he had a one on one 
meeting with the Kazakh leader Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  According to Yeltsin, the meeting helped settle a number of 
questions that used to be open earlier. 
  Nevertheless, the signing of agreements was put off from 
Monday morning to evening. 
  In the opinion of experts those hours were needed to make 
amendments in the agreements worked out by the presidents.

  [Text] Moscow March 28 TASS -- Experts from the Russian 
Defence Ministry regard the treaty on military cooperation 
between Russia and Kazakhstan, prepared to be signed by the two 
presidents, as "necessary and timely". Specialists called the 
attention of ITAR-TASS to the main provisions of the treaty. 
Specifically, it gives definition to the strategic nuclear 
forces on the territory of Kazakhstan and stresses that a 
decision of using nuclear weapons will be taken by the Russian 
president with the agreement of the Kazakh president until their 
complete elimination. 
  In the opinion of experts, the provision of the treaty 
saying 
that if the security of one of the states is threatened, the 
other one will render the needed assistance to it, including 
military assistance, is also very important. 
  The treaty envisages the division of movable and immovable 
property on the territory of Kazakhstan between the two defence 
ministries and defines the status of defence facilities. It 
also includes provisions on the use of the naval forces of 
Russia and Kazakhstan in the Caspian Sea in the interests of 
both countries, on the production, repair and deliveries of 
armaments and military hardware, etc.

Shumeiko in Moscow on Monday to discuss the development of 
bilateral relations between the two republics and CIS 
integration. 
  "It was a very interesting and intensive discussion. It

within the Commonwealth of Independent States," Shumeyko said. 
  "It is time to raise the question of closer integration 
within the CIS, perhaps, even the establishment of some 
supra-national bodies which could transform the Commonwealth 
into something like a union. Not the kind of union we had 
before, but a commonwealth preserving the sovereignty and 
freedom of all member states," Shumeyko said. 
  The two leaders also discussed problems of citizenship, non- 
payment crisis and other issues. "Our points of view on 
bilateral relations coincided almost 100 per cent," Shumeyko 
concluded.

  [Text] Russia regards the NATO program Partnership for 
Peace as a phase in the establishment of a new collective 
defense system in Europe, Russian Defense Minister, Pavel 
Grachev, emphasized at a meeting of the military command in 
Moscow on Friday [25 March]. 
  Grachev said Russia did not intend to integrate with NATO 
military structures but would seek more cooperation with the 
alliance. 
  Speaking on the participation of Russia in the NATO program, 
Grachev stated that Russia would seek the appropriate status for 
itself according to its position and role. He stressed that any 
attempts to resolve European problems would have no future 
without Russia. 
  Development of the Russian Armed Forces during the first 
three months of this year was considered at the meeting. The 
military command also discussed issues concerning military and 
mobilization preparations of the army, accommodation of Russian 
servicemen withdrawn from other states and financing of the 
Armed Forces. 
  The Russian Defense Ministry's board will meet in Moscow on 
March 26 to discuss issues on the levy.

  [Text] Moscow March 25 TASS -- Deputy Russian Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin backed Russian participation in the 
Partnership for Peace program today at the State Duma after 
being informed of the results of parliamentary hearings on the 
issue. 
  In his words, the Russian possible signing of a 
corresponding 
framework agreement will not infringe Russian interests but help 
to enhance Russian influence on many foreign political processes 
in Europe and throughout the world. 
  The deputy foreign minister stressed that Russian-NATO 
contacts within the Partnership for Peace framework will not 
hamper comprehensive cooperation with Commonwealth states, which 
are of special interest for Russia. 
  Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Valeriy 
Manilov said that the Russian adoption of the Partnership for 
Peace program has not been "directly" discussed at the Security 
Council, but will be considered as part of Russian foreign 
political activities at the next council meeting. 
  He said that Russian participation in the program is a 
"compromise between supporters and opponents of NATO expansion". 
A refusal from this partnership may result in Russian political 
isolation on the European continent. Manilov described the 
program as a "door to European collective security". 
  First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin told the Duma 
meeting that the NATO program carries no threat to Russian 
interests. He stressed that Russia, being a great power, 
carries a special responsibility and special obligations on the 
upkeep of universal peace and stability. 
  The State Duma will return to the discussion of Russian 
participation in the Partnership for Peace program at the next 
stage of parliamentary hearings on the issue.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Russian far

NATO open its doors to countries of the former Soviet Union. 
Zhirinovskiy made the above statement today in an exclusive 
interview to RTP's "Common House" program. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] "Eastern European leaders believe they will 
receive supplementary aid just because they will become members 
of NATO. They will get nothing from NATO. Instead, they will 
polish the boots of German and American officers. That is what 
the Polish, the Hungarians, the Czechs and Slovaks will get. 
The Bulgarians will polish the boots of Turkish officers." 
  Zhirinovskiy also threatened the West with a third world war 
if NATO opens its doors to former Solviet Union republics: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] "If you do not want war, do not let any 
Russian neighbor in. These territories are vital to us, Russia. 
The Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central 
Asia. If you try to include these countries in NATO, you will 
be responsible for the third world war, from which only Russia 
will come out as a winner as it did in the second world war."

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Bashful but Rich Pioneers From </F>
the United States To Visit Russia"] 
  [Text] It will be possible to judge to a certain degree 
just how ready the United States is to support reforms in 
Russia, not so much with words as with deeds, from the results 
of the mission on which an unusually impressive delegation of 
U.S. businessmen, headed by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, 
arrives in our country Monday, 28 March. 
  The list of delegation members reads almost like a "Who's 
Who 
in the U.S. Business World": presidents and chairmen of major 
corporations like Westinghouse Electric, General Electric 
Aircraft Engines, Dresser Industries, Texaco, and so forth. 
  In his parting address to the delegation -- which is to 
visit 
St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg in addition to Moscow -- the 
U.S. President stressed that "a Russian economy moving toward 
the market is vitally necessary for the economic security of the 
United States and the world as a whole." 
  There have already been similar visits to Russia, albeit not 
on such a scale. But they proved virtually fruitless: Neither 
an active influx of capital, nor impressive joint projects, nor 
qualitative development in bilateral trade ensued. 
  It is perfectly obviously that, even if accords are achieved 
also on this occasion, it cannot be ruled out that many of them 
will be left hanging -- if only because of the numerous 
restrictions which are still being maintained in trade and 
business relations between our countries to this day, and which 
Washington is not in any particular hurry to revoke, thereby 
blocking our products' access to U.S. markets. Ultimately, the 
lifting of these restrictions depends less on U.S. businessmen 
than on the U.S. Government. 
  Well, the main thing of course, is investments: A tough 
decision is required from the Americans on whether they are 
prepared to invest money -- and considerable sums at that -- in 
our economy, or whether they prefer to continue waiting for 
something. Sometimes the impression arises that the spirit of 
pioneering and risk -- which, in point of fact, paved the path 
to the prosperity and success of America itself -- has now 
seemingly been lost. U.S. businessmen, it seems, are waiting 
for almost ideal, hothouse conditions to be created for them in 
Russia.

the modern hotel outside town called "Ogni Murmanska." The

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Mar -- It has fallen to the lot of 
Murmansk, which is situated beyond the polar circle, to be the 
venue of the "first date" which the foreign minister of the 
Russian Federation, Andrey Kozyrev, will have with the new head 
of the Norwegian foreign policy department, Bjorn Tore Godal. 
Their talks will take place on 26 March there and they will 
become an original Russian debut for the Norwegian minister in 
his present role. [passage omitted] On the eve of his visit 
in an exclusive interview with an ITAR- TASS correspondent in 
Oslo, Bjorn Tore Godal said it was particularly important that 
the meeting with the Russian foreign minister would take place 
in Murmansk since Norway attaches great importance to bilateral 
cooperation not only at state level but at regional level as 
well. "The program of action with regard to Eastern Europe" 
drawn up by the Norwegian Government gives priority to the 
Russian northwestern regions. The increased activity of the 
council for cooperation in the region of the Barents Sea also 
opens wide prospects. 
  One should admit that the environmental situation in 
northern 
Europe at present is causing well nigh the greatest concern of 
the Norwegian public since the region is very vulnerable in this 
sense. The closeness of powerful nuclear arsenal of the ships of 
the Russian Northern Fleet hardly adds to the optimism of the 
Norwegians as regards ensuring ecological safety. 
  The fact of Russian military presence at NATO's northern 
flank is an objective reality. In this connection the 
Norwegians pin great hopes on establishing the spirit of 
openness and partnership in relations between the East and the 
West in the military and political sphere. The readiness to 
join the Partnership for Peace program announced by Russia and 
the current joint exercises in the Barents Sea with the "Pomor" 
code name give evidence to the fact that these expectations are 
justified. 
  The real contents and expanding range of the 
Russian-Norwegian cooperation predetermine the intensity of 
personal contacts between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries. One can have no doubts: the Murmansk meeting will be 
followed by other meetings. The more successful the present 
start in Murmansk is, the more often these meetings will be.

  [Text] Murmansk March 26 TASS -- Russia is striving for 
full-scale cooperation with the European Union, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev told correspondents here today upon the 
completion of his Murmansk negotiations with Norwegian Foreign 
Minister Bjorn Tore Godal. 
  The minister said they are working on a major agreement with 
the European Union. 
  Kozyrev welcomed the upcoming Norwegian joining of the 
European Union and expressed the hope this will help to attract 
European Union's investments in development of the Barents Sea 
area and the Murmansk region. He said Russia will benefit from 
Norwegian joining of the European Union, as Russian-Norwegian 
relations are perfect. "The better our neighbours live the 
better we will live," said Kozyrev. 
  Norway welcomes Russian constructive contribution in 
solution 
of world problems, including its initiative on settlement around 
Sarajevo, Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal told 
correspondents in his turn. 
  The minister was on a brief visit to the major city of the 
extreme north at the invitation of his Russian counterpart. 
Bjorn Tore Godal, recently nominated foreign minister, 
described his first meeting with Andrey Kozyrev as important and 
fruitful. 
  He said they managed to discuss bilateral cooperation in the 
Barents Sea area in view of broader European prospect and dwell 
on many aspects of bilateral and regional interaction. 
  Europe does not need new lines of delimitation, it is 
necessary to consolidate contacts in the security sphere, 
stressed the Norwegian minister. He welcomed the Russian 
intention to sign the NATO Partnership for Peace program in the 
near future. 
  The Norwegian official said that the negotiations discussed 
Russian relations with the European Union, which the sides plan 
to regulate by a special agreement. 
  On the same day Bjorn Tore Godal left Murmansk for Norway.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Pelts report: "Exercises Are Not a Show of </F>
Strength. Our Correspondent Reports From Tajikistan"] 
  [Text] Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of 
defense, has visited the area where the Collective Peacekeeping 
Forces [CPF] and Russian Border Guards serving on the 
Tajik-Afghan border are conducting exercises. On arrival in the 
exercise area he joined the Uzbek and Tajik defense ministers 
and the Republic of Tajikistan leaders attending the exercises 
to hear a report by Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of 
the CPF in Tajikistan, who is charge of the exercises. 
  The exercise schedule first involved halting an "attacking 
enemy grouping" jointly with border guard defenders. A 
defensive engagement was conducted in collaboration with the air 
force and artillery and tank subunits. Over 1,000 targets, 
along with around 60 decoys, were set up on the battlefield for 
the air force and artillery. According to plan the attacking 
enemy first came under fire from three artillery batteries, 
three mortar batteries, and three "Uragan" rocket-launcher 
batteries. The ground forces' operations had helicopter support. 
  Once the "enemy" had been halted, it was subjected to a 
20-minute bombardment involving all forces and means of 
firepower. In addition, helicopters dropped a reinforced company 
by parachute into an area of possible "enemy" breakthrough. 
Then came a counterattack with the support of artillery 
subunits and ground-attack aviation. 
  In the course of the exercises their commander, Col. Gen. 
Boris Pyankov, commented on the actions of the CPF, who 
demonstrated high combat teamwork and coordination, staunchness 
in defense, and swiftness in offense. 
  At the end of the exercises the defense minister emphasized 
that the troops' actions merited an overall high assessment. On 
the basis of obervers' reports, artillery and mortar subunits 
received an excellent rating. The rest were rated "good." It 
must be stressed that the exercises involved long-range 
aviation, ground-attack aircraft, and fighters, which provided 
the area with air cover. Observers report that over 50 percent 
of the targets, around 100 of which were mobile, were hit during 
the exercises. 
  The thorough engineering preparation of the exercise area 
must be pointed out. Within a short space of time the troops 
equipped a defense area and fully prepared the training zone. 
Army Gen. Pavel Grachev pointed to the increased proficiency of 
the Russian troops and the Uzbek and Tajik troop subunits. He 
once again underlined that these exercises were planned and are 
in no way connected with a show of strength, a charge that 
people are trying to level at the CPF. After the exercises he 
thanked all the personnel who took part in the exercises, handed 
out orders and medals, and also issued an order awarding early 
promotions to a large number of officers. Pavel Grachev then 
went to Parkharskiy Rayon, where an epidemic of toxipathic 
hepatitis broke out in 1993. He gave doctors there 5,000 
disposable syringes and met with local residents, who thanked 
Russia's defense minister for his attention and concern.

  [Text] The Russian Government has expressed its deep 
concern at developments in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone. 
An appeal to the leaderships of Georgia and Abkhazia, which was 
issued on Saturday [26 March] through Foreign Ministry channels, 
expresses the hope that both sides involved in the conflict will 
not allow the resumption of bloodshed and will remove obstacles 
in the way of negotiations. 
  A few days ago the Georgian leadership requested the Russian 
president and defense minister step up their efforts to settle 
the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. Otherwise, Eduard Shevardnadze 
said speaking on Georgian television, events in Abkhazia may 
become uncontrollable and a fresh escalation of the conflict 
unavoidable. 
  Today's appeal by the Russian Government expresses a 
readiness to redouble its efforts to help the opposing sides 
achieve mutually acceptable accords.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Oliynik report: "`Blue Helmets' Make For Bosnia. </F>
Reinforcements for 2d Russian UN Battalion"] 
  [Text] An advance detachment of Russian "Blue Helmets" set 
off from Ryazan by a military aviation aircraft 25 March. It 
will reinforce the personnel of the 2d Russian battalion which 
is part of the UN peacekeeping forces on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina where, once the Russians arrived, it became 
possible to conclude the long-awaited peace between the warring 
sides. 
  The dispatch of an additional contingent from the Russian 
Army to Sarajevo with equipment and weapons, Colonel General 
Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Troops, said in a 
conversation with your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, is being 
effected with the knowledge and agreement of the UN Security 
Council. This concerns an additional military contingent of our 
"blue helmets" numbering 300 men, which has been allocated by a 
directive of the Russian president and with the agreement of the 
Federation Council in response to a request from Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali to participate in conducting peacekeeping 
operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  As the Airborne Troops commander stressed, the presence of 
Russian paratroopers from the UN peacekeeping forces is a key 
aspect in the implementation of the plan for the political 
settlement of the Bosnian crisis, put forward by Russia in the 
second half of February. But recently, after Russian 
paratroopers mounted posts on demarcation lines and the 
collection points of Serbian heavy guns which have been 
transferred under control of UN forces, and when mutual 
cooperation between the UN and Serbian commands was established, 
as is clear from reports coming into the Foreign Ministry and 
reports from Colonel Viktor Vorobyev, commander of the 
battalion, the command of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
making attempts to change the original task for our UN 
battalion. The question of giving it appropriate peacekeeping 
status is deliberately being dragged out, which is making it 
possible to put the Russians in the UN reserve. 
  At present, the commander of the Airborne Troops reported, 
our paratroopers have left a key post across the River Miljacka, 
as well as several posts on a likely avenue of tank approach in 
the Serb area of Grbavica. The Russians' positions have been 
occupied by French "Blue Helmets," which is a violation of the 
treaty with the Serb side, and may lead to an escalation of 
tension in this area which is explosive as it is. Obviously, 
Col. Gen. Podkolzin noted, bringing Russian peacekeeping forces 
into Sarajevo, and reinforcing them by 300 servicemen, the first 
detachment of whom is now being sent to Bosnia, and also our 
intention to send military observers to the area of the airport 
of the city of Tuzla, is generating concern in the West that 
Russia has taken on an excessively active role in settling the 
crisis in the Balkans. 
  Nevertheless, the commander of the Airborne Troops said in 
conclusion, in accordance with the political settlement plan, we 
are continuing to send our "Blue Helmets" to Sarajevo. Today's 
landing party comprises 100 servicemen: 59 officers and warrant 
officers, and the rest -- noncommissioned officers and soldiers 
who have performed their compulsory service in the Airborne 
Troops and have concluded contracts with the Ministry of Defense. 
  ...An inspection of the "Blue Helmets" was carried out on 
the 
airfield near Ryazan. It was conducted by Major General Nikolay 
Staskov, deputy commander of the Airborne Troops for the 
Peacekeeping Forces. For the first time, before the departure 
of the "blue helmets," a blessing ceremony was carried out which 
was conducted by clergy from the Orthodox and Islamic faiths 
(those going to Bosnia include Muslim soldiers).

  [Text] Zagreb, 25 Mar -- Today, a contingent of 100 Russian 
paratroops arrived at the Croatian capital's airport from 
Ryazan, accompanied by a back-up group. On Saturday [26 March], 
it will be transferred to Sarajevo on two UN peacekeepers' 
aircraft to reinforce the Russian element of the "blue helmets." 
  The back-up group includes a representative of the Russian 
Federation president, senior officers of the General Staff of 
Russia's Armed Forces, and of the airborne forces and diplomats. 
As Major General Nikolay Stasko, the head of the group and 
deputy commander of the Russian Federation airborne forces, told 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent, its mission includes settling issues 
linked to the status and tasks of the Russian peacekeeping 
contingent in Sarajevo. The fact was, he explained, that the UN 
Secretariat had yet to grant the Russian unit the status of a 
fully-fledged battalion of peacekeeping forces and was using it 
as a reserve element. The Russian soldiers and diplomats intend 
to discuss this matter with General Michael Rose, the commander 
of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The airborne company that arrived includes soldiers of 10 
nationalities and various religious persuasions. They include a 
Muslim platoon that is to serve in the Serbian sector of 
Sarajevo.

Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] On Friday, chief Vladislav Petrov of the press 
service of the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power Production said 
the Russian and Ukrainian governments had already discussed the 
link between the delivery of Russian fuel to the Ukrainian 
nuclear power plants and the withdrawal of nuclear ammunition 
from Ukrainian territory. 
  According to Petrov, the United States was still waiting to 
meet its pledges under the Russian-US-Ukrainian memorandum which 
was signed early this year, during President Clinton's visit to 
Moscow. The United States pledged to foot bills for the 
production of nuclear fuel in Russia whereas Russia pledged to 
deliver the fuel to Ukraine. 
  The absence of the promised money could put off the delivery 
of fuel to Ukraine. The transfer of the nuclear ammunition from 
Ukraine to Russia, where it is to be turned into fuel, would 
take fairly long. 
  Earlier this week Ukrainian officials, including Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy 
indicated that Kiev could reconsider the schedule of the 
transfer of the nuclear ammunition to Russia if Moscow failed to 
deliver fuel to the Ukrainian power plants. 
  In Petrov's view, procrastination, on the part of the United 
States, could provoke a new crisis in Russian-Ukrainian 
relations. 
  The United States would meet its pledges. So would Russia. 
But it remained unclear, said Petrov, why Kiev was apt to offer 
highly emotional response to purely technical problems.

  [Text] Kaliningrad, 26 Mar -- Russia and Poland today 
signed a bilateral agreement on comprehensive cooperation by 
their border guards against organized crime. 
  "This Russian-Polish agreement is just the first step 
towards 
creating an all-encompassing system to counter organized crime 
in Europe," the commander in chief of Russia's border guards and 
head of the Russian delegation, Andrey Nikolayev, told a news 
conference afterwards. "So far this has been done at regional 
level, but in the very near future we intend to conclude similar 
agreements with our counterparts from Lithuania and Belarus, and 
Poland is also willing to join them. After that, there should 
be an agreement at overall, pan-European level." 
  It was stressed at the news conference that while becoming 
an 
obstacle to criminal gangs, the Russian-Polish border should 
remain as open as possible for economic and cultural cooperation 
between the two states.

  [Text] St. Petersburg (DDP/ADN) -- Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe has spoken in favor of even stronger links between Russia 
and Europe. "The West needs Russia as a partner capable of 
action in political, economic, and strategic terms," Ruehe 
stressed in St. Petersburg at the weekend. A stable Russia is 
in the interest of both Germany and Europe as a whole. The West 
will therefore continue to support the "political, economic, 
social, and military rebuilding process" in the country. 
However, Russia must create the conditions for the success of 
the reforms itself. 
  German-Russian relations have always been particularly 
important, Ruehe underscored. The friendship between the two 
countries is an important pillar of present stability and the 
future security order in Europe. The further deepening of 
relations, also in the military sphere, is a contribution to 
"transparency and predictability" on the continent. 
  Ruehe is attending a meeting of the "Bergedorfer discussion 
round" in St. Petersburg. The association was set up around 30 
years ago in Bergedorf near Hamburg. Politicians, military 
representatives, scientists, and representatives from 
organizations from Europe and American are taking part.

  [Text] The international sanctions against Iraq could be 
softened and later lifted if Iraq "stated in clear and 
unequivocal terms that it recognized the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and independence of Kuwait and accepted a 
marked Iraq-Kuwait border," a highly placed official in the 
Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax. 
  He said that the Iraqis insisted that they were honoring the 
disarmament conditions of UN Security Council Resolution 687. 
"For the Kuwaitis, however, Iraq's disarmament is less important 
than its abandonment of plans to take over Kuwait. This 
approach is quite reasonable," the official said. 
  He also said that the UN Security Council discussed the 
extension of sanctions every two months. "The Security Council 
chairman stated recently that the Council decided to keep the 
sanctions in place. This time, incidentally, there was no 
question of lifting or alleviating the sanctions (lifting the 
oil embargo -- IF). We thought that the Security Council 
chairman's statement could be read as admission that positive 
changes could be detected in the Baghdad's activities which 
suggested its intention to comply with what the international 
community wanted. Iraq had taken steps to implement the 
Security Council resolutions on destruction of missiles and 
other weapons." 
  According to the diplomat, "Russia wanted a certain test 
period to be imposed on Iraq. UN Security Council resolution 
715 enables imposing a long-term monitoring. Certain 
installations could be subjected to an extended technical and 
visual supervision under that resolution. Russia wanted to give 
Iraq, say, six months. If all disarmament conditions of 
resolution 687 were met during that time, then, in compliance 
with item 22 of that resolution the issue of lifting the oil 
embargo could be raised." 
  The diplomat said, "Iraq must comply with all UN Security 
Council Resolutions. But Iraq should be given a chance to see 
light at the end of the tunnel."

  [Text] Russia "will cease to be a maritime power" if it 
transfers the South Kurils to Japan, Chairman of the Committee 
on Geopolitics Viktor Ustinov (Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia) told a news conference in the State Duma Thursday. 
  If the islands are transferred to Japan, "there will be no 
need for us to keep the Pacific Fleet, because it will have no 
access to the ocean," Ustinov believes. In his opinion, Russia 
has virtually lost the Baltic and the Black Sea Fleets. The 
possibilities of the Northern Fleet have been considerably 
reduced. 
  Ustinov suggested that the withdrawal of an aviation 
regiment 
from the South Kurils shows that "some politicians continue to 
pursue the aim of playing "the Kuril card" and selling the 
islands to Japan." 
  The press conference heard the concepts of the State Duma 
committees on geopolitics and security regarding state borders. 
Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security Viktor Ilyukhin 
believes that normal border demarcation would take 5-7 years and 
cost two to three Russian annual budgets. In this connection, 
he believes that the CIS countries should have a single external 
border and single border troops. And technically they should 
reinforce only the border with the Baltic states. Ilyukhin is 
convinced that the internal borders between CIS countries should 
only be concerned with hygiene control.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Krasulin report: "Pyongyang Intends No </F>
Concessions"] 
  [Text] The U.S. statement on the holding of the "Team 
Spirit `94" military exercises with South Korea, the rejection 
of a third round of talks with the DPRK on nuclear security on 
the Korean Peninsula, and the intention to submit for 
consideration by the UN Security Council a resolution on 
economic sanctions against North Korea if its authorities do not 
allow the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA] to carry 
out a repeat full inspection of nuclear facilities and refuse to 
exchange special envoys between North and South have been 
assessed in Pyongyang as an attempt to exert blatant pressure. 
This was said in a 21 March DPRK Foreign Ministry statement, 
whose contents were announced to journalists Tuesday by Son 
Song-pil, DPRK ambassador in Moscow. 
  The document notes in particular that, in its demands, the 
United States has gone considerably beyond the bounds of the New 
York accords of 25 February and is "proceeding on the basis of 
its former policy of a hostile attitude toward Korea"; the 
failed IAEA inspection is being used as a pretext to "isolate 
and stifle the DPRK." 
  The ambassador also announced that under the complex 
conditions of holding an extraordinary inspection of nuclear 
facilities, the Korean authorities did everything possible to 
make it a success. As for the analysis samples which IAEA 
specialists failed to obtain from one laboratory, the Korean 
side gives an assurance that the agency's control instruments 
installed during a previous inspection are still there, and the 
IAEA seals have not been broken. 
  He stressed that, since the United States and the IAEA are 
using the results of the inspection to exert pressure on the 
republic, the DPRK no longer considers it "its duty to provide 
uninterrupted guarantees for the IAEA." "We will not be making 
any unilateral concessions, and if Washington takes tough 
measures we will be forced to respond appropriately. We are 
still ready for a dialogue, but if the United States chooses a 
military way to solve the problem, we will respond in kind," Son 
Song-pil stressed. "In this complex situation America should 
make a more realistic assessment of the possible consequences." 
  The ambassador warned of the danger which could be posed by 
the ending of the negotiating process. In this event the DPRK 
would be forced to carry out the government decision -- 
currently in abeyance -- to withdraw from the Nonproliferation 
Treaty. This, in his opinion, could lead to the galvanization 
of nuclear developments in a number of other countries, which 
are already near-nuclear-capable, and, as a result, to the 
breakdown of the entire system of nuclear arms control. 
  It seems as though the United States is not ruling out the 
possible use of military force in the Korean question. THE 
WASHINGTON POST reports that, apart from the plans to increase 
the U.S. military contingent and to deploy another 48 Patriot 
surface-to-air missile systems in South Korea, it is also 
planned to redeploy USN aircraft carriers closer to the Korean 
seaboard. 
  At the same time, the United States is trying to find UN 
allies to support its policy in regard to Pyongyang. Naturally, 
without the help of Japan, China, and Russia, any restrictive 
measures would be ineffective. On Monday, Albright, U.S. 
representative to the United Nations, met with delegates from 
the UN Security Council countries. A draft resolution calling 
on North Korea to agree to all the IAEA inspectors' demands was 
discussed, and soundings were taken on the attitude of Britain, 
France, Russia, and China toward sanctions against Pyongyang. 
According to Radio Liberty, Russia and Britain supported the 
U.S. position. France opposed tough measures, and China 
abstained. We would recall that each Security Council member 
has the right of veto -- consequently, the agreement of all of 
the "big five" is needed for sanctions to be imposed. 
  In the opinion of Professor James Morley of Columbia 
University, the Security Council members may be able to draft a 
resolution in general terms, but they are unlikely to reach a 
unanimous view on the use of sanctions. It is hard to imagine, 
he stated in an interview with a Radio Liberty correspondent, 
that China, Japan, and even South Korea would agree to military 
action. Clearly, Russia would give its verbal assent to the 
resolution, but would hardly want to get involved in military 
operations. 
  The leaders of the Russian foreign policy department are 
themselves being quite restrained in their statements on the 
subject of Korea. Thus, commenting on recent talks with 
Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Aleksandr Panov, Russian 
Federation deputy foreign minister, stated that "both sides 
consider it necessary to main permanent contact, to continue 
talks on the DPRK nuclear problem, and, possibly, to seek some 
new approaches, since current approaches have proved 
insufficiently effective." 
  Western observers are in practice failing to take account of 
the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Aid between the DPRK and 
Russia, to which the latter is party as the successor to the 
former USSR. At the same time, they are not ruling out the 
possiblity that the Russian Federation may adopt some kind of 
independent stance on this issue, as was the case recently on 
Sarajevo. 
  Judging by everything, Washington does not expect any 
immediate exacerbation of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. 
Confirmation of this was the Pentagon decision to send the 
Patriot systems by sea rather than by air. The idea is that 
this will not only allow Washington to defuse the political 
tension with respect to this step, but will clearly also give 
the DPRK time to review its position vis-a-vis a full inspection.

  [Text] Kiev [No dateline as received] -- On 24 March a 
debate on Ukraine's accession to the CIS economic union treaty, 
with the rights of a full-fledged and not an associate member, 
was taking place at the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine upon the 
initiative of Vice Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk. Valentyn 
Landyk explained the necessity of acceding by the existence of 
customs barriers which "hamper the movement of commodities 
within CIS" as a result of which "Ukraine is losing market 
outlets". Deputy Minister of Economy Leonid Minin, and Mykhaylo 
Umanets, chairman of the State Committee of Ukraine for the use 
of nuclear energy, who, in particular, referred to Ukraine's 
dependence on Russian nuclear fuel, supported him. 
  Vice Prime Minister Vasyl Yevtukhov, Minister of the 
Environment Yuriy Kostenko, and Ihor Podolev, the president's 
adviser on credit and financial issues, were resolutely against 
Ukraine's accession to the CIS economic union treaty with the 
rights of a full-fledged member. Vasyl Yevtukhov reminded those 
present that earlier, when the issue on the accession to this 
union was raised, Ukraine made eight reservations which were to 
be taken into account. Ihor Podolev remarked that this treaty 
should be considered as a political rather than economic 
document and that it "gives nothing" to the economic 
integration. He also emphasized that it is possible to accede 
to the treaty only taking into account the current situation but 
not prospects for the future. In his opinion, such a union will 
be ineffective "because the CIS markets will not contribute to 
improving the quality of products". 
  Yevhen Marchuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine, 
also 
warned against this step in view of the negative consequences 
for the economic independence of Ukraine in 5 to 10 years time. 
  Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko reminded of the 
foreign political consequences for Ukraine in its relations with 
the West European countries in case it joins the treaty, in 
particular, in view of the signing of an agreement with the 
European Union on 23 March. He was inclined to the opinion that 
it was necessary to analyze the text of the treaty in detail. 
Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy agreed with the 
proposal made by Anatoliy Zlenko and proposed that this issue be 
considered later. 
  On 25 March chief of the department for relations with the 
CIS countries at the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Kostyantyn 
Petrov remarked during his conversation with a UNIAN 
correspondent that "talks to the effect that Ukraine should 
fully accede to the treaty have long been in progress, some 
people really believe that Ukraine will have more opportunities 
within a single economic space. However, those documents are 
being worked out so far which relate only to Ukraine's associate 
membership in the economic union." The final say, as Kostyantyn 
Petrov emphasized, belongs to the president.

  [Text] Ukraine is prepared to play a limited role in the 
NATO Partnership for Peace program, as long as this does not 
call for too much resources, assistant Ukrainian Defense 
Minister Vadym Grechanynov told a news conference in the 
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. 
  He said that Ukraine is short of money for fully-fledged 
cooperation with NATO. However, the participation of one or two 
representatives of the Ukrainian general staff is possible in 
planning training operations. 
  Grechanynov said that Ukraine's involvement in peace-keeping 
operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina effectively means participation 
in the Partnership for Peace program. 
  A NATO delegation stayed in Ukraine for several days. It 
studied possible practical steps for cooperation with NATO. The 
delegation met the chief of Ukrainian general staff Anatoliy 
Lopata and Deputy Ukrainian Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk.

  [Text] The negotiations between the National Space Agency 
of Ukraine (NSAU) and an official delegation of the U.S. space 
agency (NASA) ended in Kiev Wednesday producing a joint 
declaration. 
  According to the document, the two sides will look into the 
possibilities for cooperation in space research, physics of 
circumterrestrial space, the mutual impact between the sun and 
the earth, space-based scanning of the earth, space biology and 
aeronautics. In part, the declaration proposed using the 
Ukrainian scientific vessels Yuriy Gagarin and Academician 
Korolev. 
  According to NSAU Director General Vladimir Gorbulin, the 
vessels were used to maintain space communications in times when 
the former Soviet Union still existed. 
  "Nowadays they are out of service and are a heavy burden for 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry," he pointed out. 
  Gorbulin said the talks failed to touch on the possibility 
of 
bilateral cooperation in producing spacecraft and using space 
transportation systems which is of great importance for Ukraine. 
  In his opinion, that was caused by Ukraine's failure in 1992 
to back the U.S. proposal to expose its missile technologies to 
international control. At the moment, as many as 26 countries 
have signed the agreement.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Environmental Protection Ministry 
press center reported that Yuriy Kostenko, minister for 
protection of Ukrainian environment, returned from an official 
trip to the Netherlands and the United States. 
  During his stay in the Netherlands, a memorandum was signed 
on ecologic cooperation between the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection, and the Ministry of Construction, 
Territorial Planning and Environment, the Ministry of 
Transportation, Public Works and Water Management, and the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Fishing and Nature of the Netherlands. 
  This memorandum provides for cooperation in the sphere of 
ecologic management and the protection of air, water, and 
wildlife. It was agreed that a working cooperation program for 
1994-95 will be approved in early April. 
  In the United States, where Yuriy Kostenko was invited to 
visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he met with 
officials from this agency, the World Bank, the Agency for 
International Development, the Department of Energy, and the 
U.S. Congress. 
  The U.S. officials displayed a deep interest in cooperation 
between Ukraine and the United States in the sphere of ecology, 
and examined a package of proposals about urgent environmental 
protection measures, such as the creation of modern laboratories 
monitoring radiation levels and water quality, recycling of 
toxic waste, launching educational television programs, and 
finally establishing an informational and educational center. 
The American side is planning to allocate $6 million to 
implement the above projects. This will be an addition to the 
$500,000 that the World Bank granted the Environmental Ministry 
last year to carry out a project called "Preservation of 
Biological Diversity of Carpathians." The American colleagues 
are ready to continue to share with us their experience and 
technologies, and want to train our specialists and provide 
financial assistance.

<F P=106> [Report of interview with former Ukrainian Premier Leonid </F>
Kuchma in Odessa by Leonid Kapelyushnyy; date not given: 
"Leonid Kuchma: Ukraine's Current Leadership Dangerous for 
Country and People"] 
  [Text] Odessa -- Leonid Kuchma's gloomy prophecy is being 
fulfilled: Inaction is leading the Ukrainian economy toward 
destruction. Does he feel to blame for the fact that in his 
time as head of government he was unable to transform the 
situation? 
  "I have often regretted that I became prime minister, and 
even more so that I did not resign in May 1993, having satisfied 
myself, six months into the job, that parliament and president 
seemed to be all in favor of reforms and economic recovery -- 
provided nothing changed," Kuchma says. "Unfortunately, 
economics also turned out to be politics.... Until the land and 
means of production become a commodity, scarcely any government 
will be able to stabilize the financial system and switch the 
economy to the track of market relationships." 
  Leonid Danilovich often cites examples: When the government, 
according to the powers it had received, adopted its first 
decree on transferring farmstead plots to private ownership, 
such a fuss was kicked up that you would have thought that the 
nation's taproot had been cut right through. The attempt to 
sell uncompleted construction projects was also blocked -- its 
value was put at 7 trillion rubles. And every time Kuchma made 
an assault on "the fundamentals" he met with more than a mild 
rebuff.... His favorite comparison: "They wanted us to walk a 
narrow path between parliament and president and imagine that we 
were on the high road of reforms." 
  The former premier considers the National Bank to be the 
main 
culprit for hyperinflation in Ukraine -- its credit policy is 
"direct sabotage against the state," in which the whole banking 
system participates. The cabinet had no chance of controlling 
corruption and rampant crime because all the power ministries 
were not under its jurisdiction. It was Kuchma who uncovered 
the monstrous abuses involving oil resources and openly accused 
the structures of state power of corruption and links with mafia 
circles; serious evidence, including evidence of violations of 
currency and financial discipline in the Black Sea Shipping 
Line, was passed on to the General Prosecutor's Office, but 
nothing come of it. 
  Having resigned, Leonid Kuchma "held back" for long enough. 
The president took charge of the government; all power, as 
Leonid Danilovich had been long and unsuccessfully seeking, was 
finally concentrated in one pair of hands. But the destructive 
processes in the economy continued. Industrial production fell 
by 36 percent in the first month of the new year; metallurgical 
and chemical enterprises are shutting down; the Donbass is in 
the grip of profound crisis. And Kuchma has broken his 
silence.... 
  "The Ukrainian national economy has become hostage to 
politics and to political intriguers. Today's economy has 
nothing in common with the needs of society. The decimation of 
industry being carried out by the Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy 
government, the monopolization of the entire hard-currency 
sphere, the destruction of the state's financial and credit 
system -- this is being carried out in the interests of mafia 
and semi-mafia groups, and not in the interests of the Ukrainian 
people. The political leadership's inability to make state 
decisions is spilling over into heightened activity at the level 
of petty political intrigues. Executive power in Ukraine as a 
system of real government has already fallen victim to these 
intrigues; next in line is the Ukrainian state itself. I 
categorically assert that the current Ukrainian leadership is 
dangerous for the country and the people." 
  In his time the new premier (the third in the last few 
years) Kuchma set about building diplomatic bridges between 
Ukraine and nearby foreign parts. Leonid Danilovich brought 
back packages of specific accords, aimed at restoring shattered 
economic ties, from oil-rich Tyumen, from Turkmenia [Turkestan] 
and Kazakhstan, from Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] and Uzbekistan, from 
Belorussia [Belarus] and other fellow republics of the former 
Union. Although even then he said that Ukraine's problems were 
only 35 percent due to the disruption of ties and 65 percent due 
to internal disorder, poor discipline, and slovenliness. Today 
too he also believes that the head of state, instead of (or as 
well as) going on expeditions to the West, where they have 
difficulty making us out, should visit our near neighbors and 
negotiate -- on payments and deliveries of energy resources and 
raw materials. Incidentally, Kuchma never tires of repeating 
that the state's main problem is its balance of payments 
deficit. He cites a figure -- $13.5 billion. This sum is 
mainly due to the cost of oil, gas, and nonferrous metals for 
Ukrainian industry. 
  "Many of Ukraine's problems are offshoots of Belovezhskaya 
Forest," the former premier believes. "In the seventies Ukraine 
invested around 100 billion foreign currency rubles in the 
development of the West Siberian oil and gas complex. And it 
did not expect to receive oil resources before the end of 
perestroyka.... Not to mention the fact that Ukraine sent 
around 500,000 of its citizens to exploit the new territories, 
citizens who are to this day extracting oil and gas in Tyumen." 
  Social psychologists believe that a person's activity 
between 
the ages of 30 to 35 has a decisive influence on the formation 
of the individual. At this age the foundations are laid which 
determine behavior in subsequent life. What was the 30-year-old 
Leonid Kuchma up to? Building rockets and teaching how to fly 
them. The future director of "Yuzhmash," the top-secret defense 
enterprise, was at home in the circle of the engineering elite 
and guided space crews into orbit from blast-off. He was 
noticed and appreciated by Korolev, Yangel.... 
  In two year's of sitting in parliament no one saw him 
standing in line for the microphone, but the command personnel 
of Ukrainian industry well knew the worth of the taciturn Deputy 
Kuchma. He was confirmed in the post of premier without the 
tedious procedure of hearings and discussions -- within 15 
minutes. In May 1993, as a rocket specialist, he made 
parliament ponder deeply; as a result, the treaty with Russia on 
nuclear weapons was not ratified. Kuchma does not regret this 
even now. Kuchma's stance vis-a-vis Leonid Kravchuk's triumph 
during his recent visit to Washington is also curious. 
  "I have the suspicion that we are calling an outstanding 
achievement what is no more than a protocol of intentions signed 
by Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. Essentially, 
President Clinton has given his consent to our looking for 
purchasers of our uranium in the United States. And I do not 
see in this any guarantee that Ukraine will receive compensation 
for its nuclear warheads. 
  "The removal of nuclear missiles from alert status is a 
complex and expensive program. According to the assessments of 
U.S. specialists, it will cost Ukraine roughly $3 billion. We 
were initially promised $170 million, and now Leonid Makarovich 
has come back in triumph with $700,000. You can count the 
difference yourself." 
  "Will the problem be resolved if, with the aid of U.S. 
specialists, we remove the warheads, send them to Russia, and 
even receive the fuel elements back? No -- it will be the 
prelude to a major headache. There are 130 liquid-propellant 
missiles in Ukraine today whose guarantees have expired. For 
one type of fuel -- gintil -- we do not have the reprocessing 
technology. What will we do with it? A further point. It will 
be necessary to blow up every silo to a depth of 8 meters. Can 
anyone in Ukraine imagine what the explosion of just one missile 
silo signifies? I think not. A plant to neutralize missiles 
removed from alert status is necessary; moreover, these missiles 
will contain residual fuel, which promises considerable 
unpleasantness. Do not imagine that things will be any better 
or easier with solid-fueled missiles. The first stage of these 
missiles consists of a 50-tonne 'cigar.' Special conditions with 
a temperature regime of from 5 to 35 degrees are needed in order 
to store them. We do not have the technology to recycle them. 
We do not have a plant in which to do so. If we take the step 
of burning the solid fuel in the open we will present Ukraine 
with another Chernobyl. 
  "I am afraid that after Ukraine has been praised for 
seeking nuclear-free status, they will wash their hands of us, 
and we will be left to face this gravest of problems on our own." 
  Leonid Kuchma is extremely cautious over predictions when it 
comes to personalities. But he considers Leonid Kravchuk's 
further continuation in the office of president as problematic, 
and believes that a decision on his part to voluntary resign his 
post would be timely. 
  Kuchma sees the solution to the crisis in uniting healthy 
forces in a future parliament. Together with Vladimir Grinev 
(many political commentators consider this alliance to be very 
successful and reliable) he has set up the Interregional Bloc of 
Reforms, whose basis is the Ukrainian Union of Entrepreneurs and 
Industrialists headed by Kuchma. The bloc offers Ukraine 
guidelines for a future political policy -- the creation of a 
mechanism for mutual aid and mutual support with all the CIS 
countries, and with Russia first and foremost, and the creation 
of conditions for jointly overcoming the crisis and defending 
geopolitical and geoeconomic interests by combined efforts. 
  "Nowadays no one will survive alone. This is already 
understood by Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. But the current 
Ukrainian leadership does not yet understand this."

  [Text] Ukraine comes out against recognizing the 
Commonwealth of Independent States as a regional organization, 
against recognizing the CIS as a subject of international law, 
and against recognizing the right of the CIS to carry out 
peace-making operations. Volodymyr Handohiy, acting charge 
d'affaires of Ukraine's permanent mission at the United Nations 
declared this at the UN General Assembly during the course of a 
debate on a resolution on granting CIS the status of an observer 
at the General Assembly. In particular he said: Ukraine joins 
the consensus, as far as the given resolution is concerned, only 
in the sense that the status of a CIS observer at the General 
Assembly will be officially granted only to those community 
countries that signed and ratified the Commonwealth charter and 
became co-authors of the above draft resolution.

  [Text] Tbilisi March 27 TASS -- "I welcome the readiness 
expressed by the Russian Government actively to promote a 
resumption of the peace talks to resolve the Abkhazian conflict, 
Eduard Shevardnadze told the Georgian news agency GIA in comment 
on the Russian Government's message to the leadership of Georgia 
and Abkhazia. The message was circulated on March 26. 
  "I am gratified to note that the leadership of Russia has 
promptly responded to my letter and expressed concern over the 
latest aggravation of the conflict in Abkhazia. 
  "We support the proposal expressed in the Russian 
Government's message to resume talks and are prepared to 
continue them in Moscow in the coming days", Shevardnadze 
emphasised. 
  The Georgian leader voiced conviction that Russia can exert 
an active influence and play a positive role in a settlement of 
the Abkhazian problem, primarily in securing the return of more 
than 300,000 refugees to their homes. 
  "I am confident that the authorities of the two countries 
will remain true to the accord signed in Tbilisi on February 3 
and will accomplish the major mission to implement them. This 
is fully consonant with the consideration expressed by Boris 
Yeltsin about the historic necessity for strategic cooperation 
between Georgia and Russia", Shevardnadze said.

Interfax Saturday [26 March] that the Abkhazian leaders welcomed 
the Russian call for the non-violent settlement of relations

  They shared Moscow's call for a political accommodation and 
reiterated their willingness to seek a negotiated settlement 
which was torpedoed by the Georgians. The negotiating process 
could resume on the removal of obstacles created by Tbilisi. 
  Djindjolia hoped Russia would keep playing an active role in 
the efforts to mediate a settlement.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Chubarov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Mar -- As before, Georgia is in favor of 
a political settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. The 
Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze, who is in 
Moscow on a working visit said this at a news conference today. 
  In the minister's words, a dangerous concentration of armed 
formations is occurring on Abkhaz territory near the border with 
Georgia. All the same, Georgian diplomats are seeking ways out 
of the crisis. All of us -- Georgians, Abkhazians, Ossetians -- 
need to take an active part in devising the draft of the new 
constitution. This will make it possible to avoid 
confrontation, the minister said. 
  Chikvaidze said that the implementation of a preliminary 
accord with Russia on sending Russian peacekeeping forces into 
Georgia was one other way of settling the conflict. 
  Regarding the results of Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to the 
United States, the Georgian foreign minister put a figure on the 
loans granted to the republic within the framework of the United 
Nations -- $400 million. The Georgian diplomat noted that this 
money should help the republic's economy, which is in a very 
grave state.

Abkhazian armed forces presented an ultimatum to the Georgian 
grouping staying in the mountains of Abkhazia's Gulripsh region. 
The ultimatum contains a demand to immediately lay down arms, 
the Abkhazian military department reported to Interfax. 
  If this is not done by the end of March 25 then, in 
accordance with the ultimatum, the Georgian grouping will be 
eliminated. Security will be guaranteed to those who will lay 
down their arms. 
  According to Abkhazia's Defense Ministry, in over two days 
of 
hostilities the Georgian side has lost 50 people killed and 
wounded. 
  As Sukhumi reports, hostilities between Georgian and 
Abkhazian formations in the mountains of the Gulripsh region 
were resumed on Thursday [24 March] after two Georgian 
battalions supported by armored vehicles tried to break through 
the tunnels of the Kodorsky canyon. In the morning of March 25 
the Abkhazians entered the village of Nizhnyaya Lata where the 
headquarters of the Georgian grouping had been staying since 
last autumn and then went to the mountains after the Abkhazi 
side's defeat. 
  Meanwhile, Tbilisi asserts that the Abkhazian army is waging 
punitive operations against the civil population living in the 
mountainous villages.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Tbilisi is inclined to deploy Russian peacekeeping 
forces in Georgia even outside the frameworks of the UN 
operation. "It is impossible to solve the Abkhazian conflict 
without introduction of peacekeeping forces into Georgia," 
Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze declared at a 
press conference on Friday in Moscow. 
  In his words, this issue was being discussed during the 
recent visit of the head of the Georgian state Eduard 
Shevardnadze to New York. It was also discussed in Paris where 
Shevardnadze met with the UN General Secretary Butrus-Ghali. 
  Chikvaidze pointed out that deployment of the UN 
peacekeeping 
forces and all preparatory operations will take three months. 
"But the time goes on and forces should be introduced as soon as 
possible. We hope for Russia. The thing is that Russia does 
not want to undertake anything unilaterally. It's quite clear 
because if Moscow coordinates its actions with the UN then this 
organization will finance peacemaking operations of the Russian 
troops," said Chikvaidze. 
  In his words, it is necessary to work out a mechanism 
providing for the return of 300,000 Georgian refugees to 
Abkhazia. "The presence of such a large amount of refugees 
creates a tense situation in Georgia and even changes the 
mentality of the people," said Chikvaidze. "The Abkhazian 
separatism can make a negative imprint on the situation in other 
countries, in Russia as well." 
  Responding to our Interfax correspondent, Chikvaidze 
underlined that Georgia is ready to discuss political status of 
Abkhazia within Georgia. "I do not know how it would look like, 
but I can say for sure that Abkhazia will loose nothing minding 
what it possessed earlier in the sphere of its sovereignty. Now 
it should determine its position as soon as possible and to 
develop the country's Constitution together with the leaderships 
of Georgia, South Ossetia, and other autonomies, according to 
which we shall be able to live," said Chikvaidze. 
  In response to another question Chikvaidze said that NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program testifies to the fact that this 
organization "is looking for a new role." "The confrontation 
between military blocks sank into oblivion and NATO should find 
its ecological screen. This organization should either acquire 
new function or disband," said he. 
  In Chikvaidze's opinion, the mechanism of Partnership for 
Peace program implementation "has not been developed till the 
very end." "If one knocks at the door and asks NATO forces to 
bring order in Georgia, it will not happen. However, we still 
do not loose hope that in the future the Partnership for Peace 
concept will actually help to increase efficiency of peacemaking 
operations," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Ivlev, including recorded </F>
comment by Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze and 
Former Georgian Defense Minister Tengiz Kitovani] 
  [Text] The Georgian foreign minister came to Moscow today 
where he gave a news conference for journalists. Of course, the 
main questions concerned the situation in Abkhazia. 
  [Ivlev] Today, Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandr 
Chikvaidze, who is in Moscow, said in regard to the events in 
Kondor Gorge that they are the result of the Abkhazian side 
shooting at civilians with Grad installations. Intercepted 
radio communications talk of a large concentration of Abkhazian 
military formations near Sukhumi. Supporters of the late 
ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia are ready to join them. 
Aleksandr Chikvaidze spoke tersely about the aims of these 
military preparations by Abkhazia: 
  [Chikvaidze] They are getting ready to start an attack on 
Mingrelia. 
  [Ivlev] However, at the news conference questions were asked 
not only by representatives of the mass media. Among those 
present, journalists were surprised to see Former Georgian 
Defense Minister Tengiz Kitovani. In an exclusive interview for 
NTV he gave his forecast. If no peaceful solution to the 
conflict is found, then just like the Soviet Union was able to 
somehow be victorious over Germany during the Second World War, 
so Georgia will in a fatal struggle conquer the Abkhazians, he 
said. 
  [Kitovani] But at present more important goals will be 
observed. In my opinion if a sensible, intelligent military 
chief is found, then other things will probably happen in 
Georgia. 
  [Ivlev] In reply to the question of whether a major war 
could 
break out, Tengiz Kitovani answered: 
  [Kitovani] This depends on the weather, both political and 
also how quickly the snow melts.

  [Text] The Georgian Defense Ministry's press service told 
Interfax on Sunday that Abkhazian formations were carrying out 
massive attacks on the Georgian villages located in Abkhazia's 
administrative territory. Over the past two days, villages in 
the Lata ravine were shelled and the villages of Khutia, 
Gentsvishi, Sakeni and Myasnikovka were burnt. Some of the 
civilians were killed and hundreds of people found refuge in the 
forests and mountains. The local population formed up units 
which are offering stubborn resistance. 
  The same source announced that besides attacks in the Kodor 
ravine, Abkhazian formations had launched an attack on the 
village of Khurcha in the Zugdidi Region, and destroyed the 
village of Ganakhleba in the Gali Region. 
  The Georgian Defense Ministry stated that Abkhazian units 
were using heavy equipment, artillery and helicopters. However, 
the Georgian and Abkhazian positions had not undergone any 
significant changes. 
  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's press service 
announced 
that since the escalation of the conflict in the Kodor ravine 
two days ago, Georgia had lost 10 soldiers and 22 civilians. 
  The press service of the Abkhazian mission in Moscow stated 
with reference to the Abkhazian Defense Ministry that Abkhazian 
formations had eliminated the Georgian subversive groups based 
in high-mountain villages of the Kodor ravine and restored peace 
in them. 
  The same source reports that Georgians lost three tanks, 
several anti-aircraft installations and an armored personnel 
carrier. Large amounts of weapons were seized. 
  The press center of the Temporary Committee for Emergency 
Situations in Western Georgia reports that the situation was 
relatively calm on the border with Abkhazia along the Inguri 
River and in the region of Zugdidi. Georgian Prime Minister 
Otar Patsatsia, who earlier arrived in Zugdidi, and Chairman of 
the Temporary State of Emergency Committee Dzhaba Ioseliani, 
continue an inspection tour of the region.

President Boris Yeltsin by IZVESTIYA Chief Editor I. 
Golembiovskiy: "Boris Yeltsin: Passions Must Not Be Further 
Intensified. Russian President Speaks on Telephone With 
IZVESTIYA Chief Editor"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 25 March the editorial office 
telephoned Sochi, where the Russian president is completing his 
brief vacation. The transcript of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin's 
conversation with Igor Golembiovskiy follows. 
  [Golembiovskiy] Boris Nikolayevich, hello. Pardon me for 
calling you so early, but we were afraid it would be harder to 
talk to you later. The first question I would like to ask you 
is extremely trivial, but it has political undertones today: 
How is your health? 
  [Yeltsin] First, I must tell you that I am, regrettably, 
beginning to get accustomed to speculation about my health 
starting up as soon as I go on vacation. I feel normal 
[chuvstvuyu sebya normalno]. I have not been seeing my doctors, 
I have not been going to Matsesta.... I have been working -- I 
have a lot of mail, a lot of documents, I have been reading, 
writing, and meeting people. But I have, of course, also been 
relaxing. I have been swimming and going for walks: There has 
not been much tennis, the weather has been disappointing, the 
court was wet, but over the last few days it has dried out and I 
have played. In a word, there are no signs of illness. Talk of 
illness is just another provocation. 
  [Golembiovskiy] I cannot fail to ask how you regard the 
appearance of the so-called "Scenario No. 1" document, if I can 
use the old terminology. All the mass media are writing and 
talking about it, and "Scenario No. 2" has appeared. Is 
political life in the country reaching a new acute pitch? It is 
strange that the security services are still unable to say 
anything intelligible either about the authors or the sources of 
this material. 
  [Yeltsin] First, this smacks of provocation. Second, you 
are right, unfortunately. The relevant services have proved 
powerless, although they were given instructions straightaway; 
however, I still do not have any precise information today. 
  [Golembiovskiy] Of late you have noticeably distanced 
yourself from the democrats and radical reformers as if you were 
choosing a new role for yourself as the voice of the interests 
of all strata of society, not just the political forces whose 
objectives and convictions you hold dear. Are you not afraid 
that the upshot will be that, on the one hand, you will not win 
supporters among the opposition and, on the other, you will lose 
support among the democratic strata? Lastly, won't there be too 
high a price to pay for concessions to conservative forces, 
namely the abandonment of the reforms? 
  [Yeltsin] First of all I cannot agree with what you call my 
"distancing myself" from anyone whatsoever. I prefer another, 
more precise definition -- broadening the spectrum of 
cooperation. The complex, crisis situation in Russia and the 
events of the last few months have revealed two trends in our 
political life. On the one hand, once again we have the clear 
polarization of the political forces. The voices of those 
people who are calling for us to leap backward or forward in a 
single bound ring loudly in the ears. On the other hand, there 
is more and more understanding and a desire to organize 
cooperation and build bridges. These sentiments are being 
reinforced among political movements and parties of the most 
diverse orientations. As president I have no right to ignore 
and disregard this. Following the period of confrontation there 
is finally a chance of making the mood of cooperation and accord 
the determining factor. Precise, thorough, patient work is 
essential here. Passions must not be further intensified. 
  At the same time I share your disquiet regarding the price 
of compromise. Can it be achieved, can cooperation be 
established and the course of reform preserved at the same time? 
It was this question that was one of the main ones when work on 
the presidential message was under way. And I believe that an 
answer has been found. The main idea of the message -- 
strengthening the state on the basis of the Constitution -- is 
cherished by everyone whose common sense has not failed them, 
everyone who has a sincere interest in Russia's well-being. 
This is also a platform for cooperation and for deepening 
reform, and not for turning back the clock. My position is as 
follows: If you share the spirit of the message, we will find a 
common language; if not, don't resort to demagoguery, don't 
divert Russia's citizens from the course toward accord. 
  [Golembiovskiy] Many political observers are extremely 
skeptical about the prospects for the rapid signing of an accord 
document -- the opposing sides' interests are too polarized. Do 
you believe that political reconciliation is indeed feasible? 
How will events develop, how will you, the president, act if 
that does not happen and disputes over the document do not 
defuse but, on the contrary, aggravate the situation? 
  [Yeltsin] Needless to say, the agreement on civil peace is 
not a panacea. I have been around a long time and I am not so 
naive as to expect the agreement to resolve all the problems. 
But I am convinced that it can be a step toward this. 
Especially since the range of political forces which have 
voiced a desire to work on the agreement is quite broad. 
  The question is: How far will we be able to go down this 
road, will we stop at formulating a declaration of good 
intentions or will we be able to take another important step and 
determine the fundamental bases of accord, the forms of 
cooperation, and, most important, the mechanisms of our 
responsibility to society. I hope we will be able to achieve 
that. If we do not, I will suggest other options. I will not 
lose heart. I feel that the main demand now being voiced by 
people and by all strata of society is that stability is 
strengthened and our life rendered more peaceful. 
  [Golembiovskiy] How would you define the essential nature of 
the present stage in the economic reform? Which way is the 
Russian economy heading? Both under Gaydar and under 
Chernomyrdin we seem to be managing the economy as though blind, 
and there is still the feeling that we do not have a reform 
program and have not defined the priorities, hence the 
inconsistency and mutually exclusive measures. This could all 
end badly, and it is no wonder that people are forecasting a 
"spring offensive of the working people" when the country will 
be living not "from one wage packet to the next" but "from one 
strike to the next." What are your views on that? 
  [Yeltsin] It has to be acknowledged that the pace of real 
reform has clearly slowed down and the state's role in deepening 
the reform is negligible. You can damp down the crisis by means 
of flexible measures, even timely measures, of course. But you 
cannot overcome it and transform the economic mechanism that 
way. As for whether it is a government of reform or not -- you 
can only judge that from whether the reform itself is working 
and what its results are. That being so, the government still 
has considerable reserves and is obliged to use them 
energetically, just as it is obliged to ensure control of the 
situation and, above all, extricate the economy from the crisis 
of nonpayments. 
  As for living "from one strike to the next," all that can be 
avoided if we learn how to properly elaborate economic policy, 
anticipate its social consequences, including the negative 
consequences, and ease the burden of the reform. To be blunt, 
that is a complex task but not an impossible one. 
  [Golembiovskiy] Recently politicians and state figures of 
various persuasions in Russia have been increasingly 
persistently talking about the need to create some kind of new 
union on the territory of the CIS. Some see this as a 
manifestation of Russia's imperial ambitions, others as economic 
expediency (which is also being disputed), while yet others 
predict new cataclysms across the whole territory of the former 
USSR. Is a new unification possible in principle? And who 
will make the final decisions -- presidents, parliaments, or 
peoples? 
  [Yeltsin] I would like to rephrase your question -- is a 
complete disunification in the area of the former USSR possible 
in principle? I believe that life itself has answered that 
question. It is impossible because it would lead to a sharp 
lowering of the survivability threshold of each of our 
countries. It is impossible because it is contrary to the 
interests of the peoples and their ideas about a normal life. 
And if that is so, it changes the question -- it is necessary 
to find the optimum, the most painless, and least conflictual 
form of cohabitation. And, of course, avoid all adventures. 
  No matter what people now say about the former Union, I 
cannot call it the most successful form of the existence of our 
states and peoples. After all, it was sustained primarily by 
Russia's potential and resources. It is already being 
forgotten that for a long time today's independent states were 
called nothing less than "backward boondocks." We even took 
pride in the fact that they almost overtook Russia in a very 
short time. Admittedly, as a rule it was not the done thing to 
consider at what expense this was achieved. 
  Russia's position was extremely unsatisfactory. It did not 
have its own aspect or statehood. It seemed to have blended in 
with the background as it supported the former Union at the cost 
of its own prosperity, with the result that its own problems 
were the last to be resolved. I am convinced that this model of 
life is completely outmoded now. Today there can be no going 
back to that. 
  As for the rapprochement of the states, that has to happen 
on 
the basis of a mutual consideration of interests in which 
Russia's interests are paramount for us. It is hardly possible 
today to plan in detail how each step in that rapprochement will 
be formulated politically and legally. But I am bound to agree 
that Russia's position on this question must be more active, 
purposeful, progressive, and, if you will, passionate. 
Especially when we are talking about the fate of our fellow 
countrymen. 
  [Golembiovskiy] At the meeting with chief editors you said 
that, aside from everything else, you wanted to devote the 
period before the 1996 elections to preparing a worthy successor 
to yourself. I realise that today is not the time to mention a 
specific name, but do you know of such a person? This question 
is relevant today because several people, Rutskoy among them, 
have already announced their claims to the post of future 
president of Russia. 
  [Yeltsin] First of all I am deeply convinced that the 
Russian presidential elections must be a truly nationwide event 
[vsenarodnyye]. There can be no deviations from this 
fundamental principle of Russian democracy. Attempts are being 
made to deprive the country's citizens of this right. This is a 
mine of tremendous destructive power laid under Russian 
statehood. 
  Second, I am well aware of the desire of certain political 
circles to artificially destabilize the situation. To call a 
spade a spade, what they want is to overthrow the president at 
any price. Such adventures are founded on a thick tissue of 
lies, baseness, and greed. I want to warn everyone, and 
journalists first of all -- do not believe the rumors that are 
being circulated, do not succumb to provocation. 
  I can disabuse these people -- all their schemes will be 
exposed in the early stages and we have sufficient forces to 
take appropriate measures to preserve and strengthen stability 
in Russia. 
  As for the presidential elections, I am working on the 
assumption that they are to take place in 1996. I am now 
closely monitoring the activity of potential candidates for the 
supreme state post. There have been some disappointments and, 
as they say, some pleasant surprises, too. The parliamentary 
elections taught us all something. I can now say with a great 
degree of confidence that if in the 1996 elections the people 
show their inherent wisdom and perspicacity, then a truly worthy 
individual and state figure will be elected to the post of 
president. 
  [Golembiovskiy] One final question. Boris Nikolayevich, 
what are your immediate plans on your return to Moscow? 
  [Yeltsin] I am returning Sunday, and Monday I shall resume 
my duties in full. On 28 March I am meeting with Nursultan 
Abishevich Nazarbayev, this is an important meeting for both 
states. But as for the immediate period ahead, I have three 
major issues in addition to my current work. They are -- work 
on the mechanism and levers for implementing the presidential 
Message. Second -- the problem of the budget. I had a meeting 
here in Sochi with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, we examined 
my observations and corrected certain positions, although 
questions remained. The budget, as you know, has been sent to 
the Duma, and we will work on it further. The third issue is the 
document on civil accord -- for me this is a most important 
matter which, in my view, will determine the political health of 
society. 
  [Golembiovskiy] Thank you, Boris Nikolayevich, and I wish 
you a happy return.

  [Text] Sochi -- "I cannot understand why there is such an 
unhealthy interest in the president's health. Boris 
Nikolayevich works every morning. He has bathed in the sea. He 
has been going for walks. He has made several trips in a 
helicopter, and toured the port of Tuapse, which must be

tennis. Inasmuch as the weather has allowed us to, we have 
relaxed. Even the fact that we have simply changed scenery has 
had a beneficial effect on us. 
  "How much can you speculate about the president's health? If 
he has gone to rest in Sochi, does that mean that he must 
definitely be undergoing treatment? Are there no doctors in 
Moscow!? How many illnesses have people invented for the

  [Text] B. Yeltsin is supposed to come back to Moscow today 
or tomorrow (this weekend, that is) from Sochi where, they 
maintain, he even took a plunge in the 10-degree seawater. 
  Yet another cold bath awaits him in Moscow. Radio Liberty, 
referring to U.S. television people working in the capital and 
painstakingly compiling a video library, has revealed a 
sensation: The small president-on-vacation story is the product 
of simple editing. One shot edited into a small video report 
was untraditional and out of keeping with the general tenor, 
showing the president wearing a suit against the backdrop of a 
swimming pool. They insist that the shot is extraneous and comes 
from footage dating back to ...September 1993. It is not clear 
who needed this gimmick and why. The odd thing, however, is 
that the story was not seen again in later news programs, and 
foreign companies begging for the tape for personal purposes 
were left empty-handed.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report under the "Expert Opinion" rubric: </F>
"The War Against the Party System Took Its Toll"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- Asked whether Boris Yeltsin has an 
alcohol dependency problem, one of Russia's leading addiction 
specialists whom KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA approached replied 
unambiguously: No. 
  He had visited Sverdlovsk on several occasions during 
Yeltsin's time [as first secretary of the CPSU Oblast Committee] 
and had learned from his colleagues about the first secretary's 
reputation as a sober person, drinking far less than the 
accepted norm in party elite circles. 
  The famous addiction specialist also considers as perfectly 
illogical the supposition that Yeltsin acquired an abnormal 
yearning for alcohol while he was first secretary of the Moscow 
Gorkom [City Party Committee]. There is no genuine testimony to 
this effect from his colleagues. Had such testimony existed, it 
would have been inevitably used by Yeltsin's fierce opponents at 
the time. Both the Moscow Gorkom and the CPSU Central 
Committee, let alone the competent organs, were at that time 
peeping through all possible keyholes, looking for an alcoholic 
criminal. 
  Our interlocutor went on to offer his explanation of the 
well-known situations which have engendered a mass of rumors. 
Of course, he remembers Yeltsin's strange speech and the 
mask-like expression on his face at the city party conference 
when he was dismissed from the office of first secretary. In 
his opinion, Boris Yeltsin, who had been taken there from the 
TsKB [precise expansion unknown -- possible Central Clinical 
Hospital], had been pumped full of medicines, possibly 
narcotics. This may not have been done with malicious intention 
(as it happened, according to claims by Tsedenbal-Junior, when 
his own father was dismissed from office), it may have been part 
of the prescribed course of treatment. 
  Ever since Yeltsin took the path of war against the 
state-communist machine, and to this very day in fact, the 
incumbent president of Russia has been, according to the 
specialist's assertion, in a chronic psychotraumatic state [v 
khronicheskoy psikhotravmiruyushchey situatsii]. He finds it 
simply necessary to keep himself up with sundry tranquilizers 
which, incidentally, is recommended for many people of his age. 
  As regards the Spanish crash [Ispanskaya katastrofa], our 
interlocutor's opinion differs somewhat from the official 
version. He believes that Boris Yeltsin suffered not only an 
injury to his spine but also a cranial-cerebral injury. There 
is no doubt that he suffers from acute pains, forcing him to 
take painkillers as well as tranquilizers. 
  "You try and take something, if only a sleeping pill, at 
night," he added. "The next morning you will probably not feel 
quite yourself. Something like a hangover."

  "I had a good rest, notwithstanding the fact that weather

  At Sochi airport he said that he had had a good holiday. 
Asked by our correspondent about his immediate working plans, 
the president replied: 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] What is waiting in Moscow? Well, 
first we need to complete the mechanism for implementing the 
presidential message to the Federal Assembly. I have been 
working on this here and a group has also been at work on it in 
Moscow. We will now amalgamate our work somehow and we will 
accordingly, so to speak, and in conjunction with the Federal 
Assembly, discuss this implementation mechanism. 
  Second, there is the agreement on civil accord. I attach 
very great importance to this and have been engaged on this 
matter here as well. We also agreed that a working group would 
work on it in Moscow, and work has continued over the past two 
weeks. It also, so to speak, has its own material. 
  Of course, we would like, I personally would like us to sign 
this agreement -- all parties, public associations and groups, 
factions, power bodies -- I mean, the Federation Council and the 
State Duma, the government, and the president. 
  I think this would create a more favorable and calm

<F P=106> [Correspondent Igor Chernov report: "President Has Right to </F>
Vacation Too"] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin's two-week vacation 
is coming to an end. As informed sources report, he plans to 
fly to Moscow on Sunday afternoon. He is pleased with his 
vacation and, but for the rumors about a coup in preparation 
which are disturbing the capital, his mood would be perfectly 
fine. Incidentally, this was helped by the weather -- it was 
really warm in Sochi. 
  The president spent the second week of his vacation more 
strenuously (I do not think this was done with the aim of 
"demonstrating" his good health). He met with Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin, who flew down to discuss problems relating to the 
economy and some foreign and domestic policy questions. The 
meeting, as the prime minister told journalists, was not an 
emergency meeting. Moreover, the president continued to be 
briefed on the the state of affairs in the Kuban and flew by 
helicopter, along with Krasnodar Kray Administration Head N. 
Yegorov, over the Black Sea coast. 
  Yeltsin did not, course, forget to relax during his 
vacation. 
According to the Sochi Town Hall press service he made several 
trips around the resort and did the local sights, while the 
heliicopter trip with Yegorov, it emerged, pursued purely 
sporting ends -- a duck shoot was held at Priazovskiye Plavni. 
  The president's wife, Naina Iosifovna, who visited Sochi's 
House of Fashion and the Mini-Maxi Theater of Fashions last 
Thursday, also imparted to journalists some details of Boris 
Nikolayevich's life in the resort. According to her, the 
president even took a dip in the sea (the temperature of the sea 
water is nine degrees). 
  Aware that there are the Matsesta therapeutic waters in 
Sochi, which all the country's past leaders have taken to 
improve their health, journalists rushed to report that Boris 
Yeltsin had also undergone a course of treatment there. But the 
Matsesta complex' chief medical officer, A. Shvyrova, denied 
this information was true: "Unfortunately, Boris Nikolayevich 
did not visit us. If he had, we would certaintly have drawn 
attention to our plight...." 
  During the president's two-week vacation only a film crew 
from Ostankino managed to visit the dacha by the Bocharovo 
brook. Your TRUD correspondent's press pass did not, 
unfortunately, enable him to gain access to the estate. I was 
courteously admitted to the guardroom, my details were taken 
down..., and I was thanked for my concern. I had gone to the 
checkpoint at the president's dacha to clarify the details of a 
minor incident -- on Wednesday a group of Sochi inhabitants had 
organized a picket at the gates.... Some people were demanding 
an apartment from the president, others an increased pension, 
someone else wanted the president to deal with the local mafia. 
After holding their midday rally, the people went their 
separate ways. There were no other excesses in Sochi.

Moscow. Short Tour of the Head of State's Recent Past. Is the 
Russian President Healthy? An Impolite and Offensive Question 
for Yeltsin That Has Troubled the Public All Week. How 
Rhetorical Is It?"] 
  [Text] Yekaterinburg -- Lots of foreign and domestic news 
agencies are now trying to learn from Sverdlovsk people who used 
to know Yeltsin well whether the former first secretary of 
Sverdlovsk CPSU Oblast Committee [obkom] suffered from any 
chronic ailments. Put it this way -- among our circle, who were 
once employed at the CPSU obkom special hospital, nobody saw 
Boris Nikolayevich walking through the confusing corridors of 
the hospital building on Working Youth Embankment with 
prescriptions in his hand. I personally met his second and 
third in command in this building -- everyone without exception 
had to traipse round a dozen or so offices before they could get 
their prescriptions filled! Boris Nikolayevich can be rebuked 
for not paying attention to his health and not always finding 
the time for compulsory checkups. But that is not our business, 
it is the business of Yeltsin's relatives and doctors. 
  Admittedly, we would note that Boris Nikolayevich could have 
been improving his health at the medical establishment in the 
settlement of Izoplit, which was even more secret than the 
clinic on the embankment.... But, strange as it may seem today, 
the Sverdlovsk party nomenklatura's relationship with the press 
was democratic, and I did manage to get a few urgent interviews 
precisely in this "secret" medical firm, right at patients' 
bedsides. Unfortunately, over the course of many years I never 
saw Boris Nikolayevich here either. In the first half of the 
eighties Yeltsin was so hard-working, demanding, and energetic 
that he was more likely to drive any of his colleagues to 
Izoplit through overwork. I recall that I met up at the 
settlement with Viktor Makarov, a former "Uralkhimmash" 
director, who had been taken ill inopportunely. During this 
period Yeltsin was impatient about pursuing the idea of 
fundamentally restructuring and modernizing this plant, and 
insisting on automating old production facilities. He would tour 
the shops himself with a good 100 plant directors and city or 
rayon committee first secretaries trailing behind him.... 
Yeltsin sometimes set industrial enterprises such major and 
fantastic tasks that anyone -- even the fittest director -- 
could have a seizure! 
  In the eighties, under Boris Nikolayevich, the Sverdlovsk 
Oblast nomenklatura worked day and night, battling for the 
oblast's identity to the last breath, without exaggeration. 
Oblast Executive Committee Chairman Mekhrintsev and Deputy 
Chairman Shkrebnev died untimely deaths. Top officials' concern 
about model plants and villages was never noticed [as published] 
in the capital, and was perhaps geared to gaining the Kremlin's 
attention.... The more you built the more investment you got. 
That was the way things were! I entirely share the view that 
many responsive, hardworking, and reliable officials of that 
time were stung by the innumerable visits to the oblast by 
highly placed guests.... But you cannot touch the number one in 
such circumstances! Any incautious behavior by a top man around 
a dinner table even of dull clerks from Staraya Ploshchad could 
result in his being sent to Paris or even Addis Ababa. There 
had been other examples of this happening in the history of the 
top Urals nomenklatura.... 
  Now to turn to the question of "this matter." A secretary 
with chronic ailments -- if such a person had existed -- would 
never have gone to work in the Moscow City Committee. If some 
people today are annoyed that Yeltsin was healthy enough to make 
smart decisions, then in that case it is his opponents who are 
suffering from hangovers. Nobody from Sverdlovsk who had been 
through the Komsomol and party schooling would claim that Boris 
Nikolayevich was sanctimonious about alcohol. His participation 
in many youth and construction brigade festivities was a 
tradition. But, as eyewitnesses will recall, the group of top 
officials would never stick around until the bitter end. Boris 
Nikolayevich, as a rule, instructed more junior party members to 
look after the young people and ensure order at the festivities 
-- and then hurried off to his own work. The good thing about 
Yeltsin was that he did not lord things up at the celebrations, 
but realized that the young people had earned the money 
themselves, and, after the meal -- somewhat to the embarrassment 
of the Komsomol members -- would leave a large sum on the table. 
This purely ethical gesture would be copied by the other party 
bosses. 
  Insofar as I recall, Yeltsin's entourage was not overfond of 
people even hinting at going for a drink in the evening. 
Aleksey Tsaregorodtsev, the former first secretary of the 
Komsomol oblast committee, who was a Yeltsin aide, would get 
angry if he thought there had been any drinking the previous day 
and could quite justifiably ask: "Did you have to indulge last 
night, guys?!" One talented man dismissed by Yeltsin as a 
Komsomol obkom secretary for having attended a single party 
literally a month after starting his career is today part of the 
Urals industrial guard. The man turned out to be unusually 
strong and was able to rehabilitate himself 200 percent after 
Yeltsin's "punishment." But how tough was Yeltsin himself when 
it came to the honor of a party worker? 
  Paradoxically, in the eighties the capital's opponents 
rebuked the provincial Yeltsin for violating human rights, 
including the rights of drinkers. Boris Nikolayevich stoically 
supported and pursued throughout the Union the Seversk Pipe 
Plant's initiative of "Collective Guarantees for Labor 
Discipline!" -- this meant that if a single team member got 
drunk or went absent, the entire collective would not get its 
bonus! Lawyers from the capital's party apparatus hinted to 
Yeltsin that neither the labor family nor a worker's personal 
family should suffer, that alcohol dependency is a medical 
rather than a party matter, that in this instance the cure 
should be a private one rather than a party and state one.... 
Alas, it seems that in those days Boris Nikolayevich was more 
consistently in favor of the anti-alcohol legislation than Yegor 
Kuzmich [Ligachev]. 
  I recall how I went into the office of V. Manyukhin, second 
secretary of the CPSU obkom, with a freshly printed "dry" law. 
Viktor Mitrofanovich, who was greatly concerned about the oblast 
budget and the timely payment of wages, "assessed" the Staraya 
Ploshchad initiative in terms which I had rarely heard even 
among a small group of friends on a fishing trip.... Boris 
Nikolayevich was silent at the time -- clearly he was more 
subject to party discipline and was more cautious. Or perhaps 
he felt slightly responsible for the fact that his own campaign 
against drunkenness at work had been so distorted into the 
Politburo initiative. 
  ...Who was the first to raise the subject of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's "health"? Yeltsin's mother -- 
Klavdiya Vasilyevna -- was still in full health when we visited 
her with foreign TV journalists. Yes, his mother was terribly 
worried about her son's health, his mental balance, and the fact 
that the Moscow climate did not suit him very much and he often 
came down with colds. Klavdiya Vasilyevna was knitting woolen 
socks for Boris Nikolayevich. The bottle of vodka which my 
foreign colleagues had brought in order to talk in greater 
detail with [Yeltsin's] younger brother Mikhail Nikolayevich was 
requisitioned by me and placed in a briefcase. I told my 
colleagues that Russians bring out their own bottles.... And if 
Mikhail Nikolayevich wanted to greet you with alcohol he would 
do so, if he did not -- tough luck! 
  Tea was served, along with jam from Klavdiya Vasilyevna's 
kitchen garden. There were plenty of photographs of Boris 
Nikolayevich as a child and a young man to keep the conversation 
going.... 
  And yet somebody was playing tricks! There is no other way 
of putting it. Another team of journalists -- not the one that 
was with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. When I visited the team of 
construction workers where Boris Nikolayevich's brother Mikhail 
Yeltsin worked a few months later, I found him very angry. 
Having trusted the West European press without having any 
reliable local journalist intermediaries president, Mikhail 
Nikolayevich later read some pearls of wisdom about the Yeltsin 
family that had been concocted. 
  The sincere and very hospitable family found itself 
described as "distant," "uneducated," "country bumpkins," and, 
of course, "showing signs of alcohol dependency".... Quite 
honestly, if such provocative attacks had been made by the 
partners with whom I worked, Mikhail Nikolayevich would have 
thumped me on the back of the neck with his concrete shovel. As 
a result we stood on the roof of a unfinished house and agreed 
never to give foreigners any more information on the Yeltsin 
family! 
  ...Yeltsin was absolutely healthy when he left Sverdlovsk 
for 
Moscow. The last time I heard his happy, optimistic voice was 
in the office of Viktor Kashpurov, the CPSU obkom's finance 
chief, who was concerned about his boss' accommodations. In 
practice these were telephone calls of farewell. Judging from 
these conversations, Yeltsin's first days in Moscow were full of 
energy and hope. Who was to know that there would be so many 
suspicious people in the capital who are perhaps more sick than 
the president!

  [Text] Russian President Yeltsin has suspended the 
decision by the administration of the Krasnoyarsk Territory of 
22 February 1994 on a referendum on the draft law on 
organization of state power in the territory. 
  The spokesman for the Russian President has said that the 
decree of 26 March reads that a referendum on the draft law 
which determines in many respects the territorial status is the 
violation of Article 10, part two of Article 66 and part one of 
Article 77 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. 
  On Saturday Yeltsin issued a decree on holding on 26-27 
April 
in Moscow of an international conference "Legal and information 
problems of the creation of a single CIS economic space." 
Invited are delegates of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, the European Union, leaders of ministries and 
departments, scientific and public organizations. 
  On the same day Yeltsin greeted the participants and guests 
of the blitz chess tournament "Kremlin Stars--94." His message 
says that chess have always been popular sport in Russia. 
  Yeltsin voiced hope that new chess stars will emerge during 
the tournament, said the president's spokesman.

<F P=106> ["Own information" report: "Russia Still Needs Strong </F>
Special Services"] 
  [Text] A press conference was held yesterday at the 
Russian Federation Federal Counterintelligence Service. It was 
stated that recently, since the Russian president's edict on 
disbanding the Security Ministry and creating the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, the staffers have been certified 
and the special service's directorates and subdepartments had 
been formed with a consideration for the reforms which are being 
carried out in the country. 
  According to Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian Security 
Council, there has been no purge. The staffers were selected on 
a professioanl principle, for their professional and personal 
qualities. The Russian president's desire to create a strong 
Russian special service has been considered as far as possible.

  [Text] At the request of the Prosecutor General's Office, 
the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) revealed 
the persons who had been spreading rumors about another coup in 
Russia, FCS Director Sergey Stepashin told a news conference in 
Moscow Friday. He declined to reveal their names saying "we 
will tell you more about this as soon as possible." In an 
answer to an Interfax question, Stepashin only indicated that 
four rumor-spreaders were identified. Their fate and location 
are now in the hands of the Prosecutor General's Office. 
  Stepashin appreciated the calm reaction by the president, 
the 
prime minister and other people involved in the alleged coup and 
called on journalists to "approach fakes of all types in a more 
balanced manner." 
  Among other reasons for the appearance of such rumors, 
Stepashin pointed to the intricacy of the economic situation, 
the amnesty and its political effects. He added that the 
authors of the scheme also wanted to see the reaction by the 
president, the power structures and persons mentioned in their 
speculations and set them against each other. They failed, 
Stepashin said.

<F P=106> [Article by Gleb Pavlovskiy, editor-in-chief of the VEK XX I </F>
MIR -- The 20th Century and the World -- magazine, under the 
"Urbi et Orbi" rubric: "Confession of a Versifier. The Author 
of the Scandalous Document Thinks That Political Hysterics at 
the Top Might Have Been Provoked by Anyone but Him"] 
  [Text] Yesterday OBSHCHAYA GAZETA named the author of the 
ill-famed "Version No. 1." It turned out to be Gleb Pavlovskiy, 
a well-known journalist. Today, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA publishes 
the full text of his article that the author appears to have 
offered to his colleagues from OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. Mr. Pavlovskiy 
brought it to the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA editorial board on the 
evening of 24 March. 
  All last week I listened to the news with half an ear, did 
not follow the press, and did not realize that the buzz of 
familiar words about a "coup" had any bearing on a rough copy 
marked "Version No. 1" that flew away from me. This is why the 
latest issue of the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY weekly, with an interview 
by Yuriy Baturin, presidential national security adviser, under 
the icy heading/notification "A Search for an Anonymous Person 
Is Under Way" first elicited astonishment, then made me laugh, 
and finally worried me. 
  Who is it that they are searching for? I state with absolute 
clarity that "Version No. 1" is a working text of which I am the 
sole owner as the person who ordered it, a routine working 
fact-sheet, a compilation of open data -- reports of news 
agencies, primarily TASS, POSTFACTUM, and RIA, and also press, 
radio reports, and so forth, of course, including city rumors. 
  The text is least of all a proclamation by a hidden 
troublemaker. It is technical in nature, that is to say, it 
cannot have any author in principle. It is an analytical 
semi-finished information product prepared by various people 
using a production-line method, not meant for publication at 
all, a fact that can be deduced at least from the inscription 
"Confidential" in the left-hand corner. Who of them is the 
"anonymous person?" The man who reads the current press with a 
pencil, tracking the crossings of names and dates? The man who 
phoned information sources to find out whether so and so really 
met with N. at 1700? A school girl who puts the texts produced 
in the data base? Or I -- a customer who puts the following 
question to that same data base: "What would a coherent coup 
hypothesis look like if rumors about one (with which Moscow is 
abuzz) are added to mass media reports?" 
  I did not order only one theory -- there are further 
numbers, 
too. Having ordered a string of data on key words "Yeltsin, 
B.N./Conspiracy against/Removal/Duma/March/Contacts of 
officials... (followed by names)/Pro Theory," I obtained a 
summary of data confirming this suggestion. If I had ordered a 
summary of counterarguments -- a contra theory -- I would have 
received precisely that. Both require 15 minutes of work by the 
data base operator, a number of clarifying phone calls from the 
editorial board, and another half an hour (maximum!) to compile 
all that into a coherent text. 
  But an editorial board is a communicating courtyard, and 
editors' tables are not a place where anything should be left. 
I do not know why someone took "Version No. 1" pages from my 
table and why he or she did not take, say, "Version No. 3?" But 
if someone is going to tell me that unconfirmed theories should 
not be written on paper, I would laugh in his face -- how else 
can they be checked, I wonder? 
  What is important is not who wrote what, but who distributed 
something that was not written for him, where, and for what 
purpose. Strangely enough, this frivolous question has not been 
raised, but everyone is going out of one's way to peer over each 
other's shoulder. 
  As far as I understand it, the government is going to find 
me 
and the data base operator to try us for libel on... what? On 
an authorized list of key words? What seems to me as another 
interesting idea is the limitation of the right to consider 
theories (let me remind you that none of those involved in the 
production of this paper ever intended to publish it. And even 
if he did? An intention cannot be punished by law). 
  For the information of Mr. National Security Adviser, there 
are dozens and dozens of places in the country -- apart from 
coup plotters, madmen, spies, and financiers -- where people are 
checking every single day yet again whether a military coup is 
being prepared. Whether the president is in good health. With 
whom the defense minister is meeting and what the hell the 
troops are doing in the capital, and so on and so forth. This 
is not column writing, this is the mulling over of theories, 
this is what analysts and journalists are paid for, a work that 
sometimes results in an article, sometimes in a memo that will 
be thrown into a wastepaper basket upon being read. A version 
is advanced, checked, rejected -- and forgotten. A new one 
emerges. 
  The fact that citizens advance and discuss theories is 
beyond the security services' competence. Those who do not want 
to learn something unpleasant about themselves should not 
rummage through other people's papers. 
  Under President Dwight Eisenhower, the U.S. Congress 
officially banned analysts from considering military conflict 
scenarios that envisioned the United States' capitulation. The 
ban, booed by the analytic community, had an important 
reservation, however: "in research financed from the government 
budget." He who pays the piper calls the tune! No, our money 
is not from the budget, so we can look into what we think fit. 
The 1991 Belovezhskaya Forest coup, unfortunately, was not 
preceded by the advancing and consideration of theories 
envisioning such a possibility: The first and the last theory 
was advanced unopposed to be immediately implemented. 
  The editorial paper stolen from me (I did not consider it 
secret at all) was indeed distributed with lightning speed, as 
it was repackaged into a semiofficial one. Naturally, I did not 
give this memo to OBSHCHAYA GAZETA -- what for? Even though the 
newspaper has the right to publish a document that has been put 
in circulation by someone and has turned out to be the 
centerpiece of a provocative game. The immediate dispatch of a 
trivial text to dozens of addresses accompanied by giving it an 
air of instruction and raising a bureaucratic tide that met it 
exposes, in my view, the work of the Kremlin and the ears of 
mass organizers specializing in "Da-Da-Net-Da" ["Yes-Yes-No-Yes" 
-- reference to April 1993 referendum presidential slogan]. At 
any rate, it is the bureaucrats who commented on the rough copy 
as "a conspiracy," "an action of dark forces," and even "arson" 
whom I consider to be the actual publishers and instigators of 
the document in a shape that was arbitrarily imposed on it! The 
mass media have done in this situation what they are supposed to 
be doing -- they have done their best to exploit the sensation 
that has suddenly come their way. They cannot and should not do 
anything else. As for the fact that we were used once again -- 
well, eternal fools are to be taught till the end of time. 
  The "anonymous person" is the one who distributed the paper 
in government corridors and has been maintaining -- or affecting 
-- political hysteria at the top. I would recommend that 
government investigators look for an "anonymous person" in their 
own offices. That is my theory. 
  Finally, I offer my apologies to those people to whom this 
incident has brought trouble, including official trouble. 
Still, it is not I who is the source of the trouble, but their 
official colleagues who were stupid enough or thought it 
advantageous to present a private memo as a document "concerning 
all." But by issuing "Version No. 1400," B.N. Yeltsin has 
caused the country much greater trepidations. How about an 
investigation?

<F P=106> [Untitled article by political observer Yuriy Lepskiy under </F>
the "Seven Days of Our Life" rubric] 
  [Text] All week people were telephoning the editorial 
office from various Russian cities, and for some reason, many 
asked one and the same question: Is it true that "Ostankino" is 
being stormed? The callers had "heard" or "read" somewhere about 
a new version of a Kremlin coup actively being discussed in 
Moscow this week. Evidently, while the capital was discussing 
whether or not "version No. 1" bore any relation to reality, the 
provinces had managed to "enrich" the scheme with obligatory 
elements which it lacked with, for examaple, the storming of 
"Ostankino" and General Makashov leading the assault. 
  Personally, having always respected the reader, I even now 
consider these telephone questions no more naive than the claims 
of professional politicians that peace and accord will come 
about in Russia as a result of the amnesty applied to the recent 
prisoners of Lefortovo. 
  Terrible though it may be, everything or almost everything, 
set forth in "version 1," which revealed the mechanism of a 
possible coup, could in my view perfectly well have happened in 
reality. I go along with my readers in not ruling out in 
principle the possibility that Mr. "A" and Mr. "B" in the 
president's close or broader entourage had arranged to remove 
him from power by pleading the head of state's poor state of 
health (was this not exactly what Gorbachev's closest entourage 
did in August 1991?). Nor do I see anything remarkable in the 
fact that some Mr. "C," expelled from the political Olympus for 
lack of talent, grayness, and idleness, is not averse to 
mounting a white steed and riding into the Kremlin.... 
  However much the president's aides and counterintelligence 
officials may go on about the absurd and nonsensical nature of 
the false report that was disseminated, I know along with my 
readers that it created such a ballyhoo because it too closely 
resembles our actual life. Alas, political coups or attempts to 
carry them out are becoming almost the norm -- people are 
starting to get accustomed to them, as to snow in winter and 
green leaves when summer comes. Hence, the mistrust of attempts 
by the "opposing" sides to confirm priority for the principles 
of civil peace and accord in our harassed society. 
  The political plot as a means of resolving contradictions in 
society is evidently characteristic of our life even now. 
Secret or hush-hush decisions by cabinet and apparatus are 
another old standard in our political practice. Somehow I 
cannot recall a broad discussion in the press and on television 
of the consequences of increasing the customs tariffs on 
imported food before that decision was adopted, and yet it 
affects literally every Russian. It is a question, above all, 
of food prices. Is quiet cabinet lobbying in the government by 
supporters of Vice Premier Zaveryukha not a small "economic 
plot" to resolve the problems of Russian agricultural producers 
this year? Oh why does it not occur to anyone to organize a 
"plot" or to carry out a "coup" IN YOUR INTERESTS AND MINE 
[uppercase as published]? Why is it that, after all these 
cataclysms perpetrated "in the name of the people," things are 
no easier for the people themselves...? 
  The political coup is the natural offspring of communist 
ideology. On 7 November 1994 that grandfather will be 77 years 
old. In October 1993 his lively grandchildren -- let us 
consider them so -- got up to mischief again. Well, where there 
are grandchildren there will also be fun, while there is this 
blood kinship, while this genealogical tree with its roots back 
in October 1917 has not withered....

<F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts: "Playing at Plots as </F>
a Specific Against Unemployment"] 
  [Text] For the umpteenth time we have to note that spring 
in Russia is a time when schizophrenia and political games are 
aggravated. It is no accident that the most "drastic" 
congresses of people's deputies have been in the spring. But 
there are no congresses, no Supreme Soviet. But some people 
constantly want to play at political crises. I admit that when 
I read the now renowned "scenario no. 1" document reminiscent of 
an amateurish parody of "information to consider" from 
"Seventeen Moments of Spring" [television series from the 
sixties, set during World War II), I was surprised that anyone 
was still attaching serious importance to it. 
  At any Moscow get-together there will unfailingly by a 
former 
teacher of scientific communism who now calls himself a 
political scientist. And he will buttonhole us and unfailingly 
start to expand on his predictions regarding the struggle in the 
Kremlin corridors and the prospects of political development in 
Russia. These predictions were once so popular and well paid 
that everyone from journalists to theatrical producers set about 
producing them. But it emerged very soon that for all the 
subtlety of some constructs they suffered a very important 
shortcoming: They had only a very indirect bearing on reality. 
And for that reason they are failing to come true. To make at 
least some real forecast you must know at least something. In 
economics, social psychology, sociology, it doesn't matter. The 
press cuttings which our political scientists employ are useful 
but not enough. The forecasters' market has begun to empty. 
  And suddenly passions are being heated over the most 
commonplace political fantasy. Statements and 
counterstatements, the start of an investigation, the 
expectation of new and even more scandalous "scenarios," there 
can be no doubt that they will appear. On the basis of the 
principle: If you like it, I will draw another one. So that 
what is interesting is not the document itself but the utterly 
inappropriate reaction to it by some of our political elite. 
And in my view the present situation in Russia was reflected to 
a far greater degree in that reaction than in the document 
itself. 
  This situation is very complex. Primarily in the economy, 
where the decline of production is continuing and the crisis of 
nonpayments is growing, followed by a wave of strikes. The 
government and the president are faced with an extraordinarily 
difficult task: selectively financing sectors of vital 
importance to the state and at the same time not starting to 
print unsupported money, not sliding into hyperinflation. 
  But for all that it is a case of complexities of a different 
order from those which existed a few months ago. There is 
social tension in Russia but no serious political tension can be 
discerned. One very high-ranking German politician admitted to 
me that, when he set off for Moscow recently, he expected to see 
a city overexcited by plot rumors. In reality he was struck by 
the existing stability. People do not want to go to meetings or 
even to elections. And if they do nonetheless elect someone 
they give their preference not to those who promise the 
"delights of paradise" but to those who intend to ensure the 
streets are cleaned. 
  Which, actually, is what a sizeable proportion of Russian 
politicians seem to be trying to do in their daily practical 
deeds. Chernomyrdin and Chubays, Kozyrev and Shakhray, Luzhkov 
and Zaveryukha are different people who adhere to different 
views. But they are united by one thing: They have to resolve 
specific problems of the state's life. They are putting 
together the budget and determining the priority of particular 
tasks. Sometimes they make mistakes. But sometimes they also 
achieve success. 
  Success like the talks with IMF executive director Michel 
Camdessus. The point here is by no means the possibility of 
obtaining $1.5 billion in systemic credit. The point is that 
Western financiers, who take nothing on trust, having studied 
the draft budget and analyzed the economic situation in Russia, 
have reached the conclusion that the government's plans to lead 
the country out of the crisis are realistic. 
  But nor can we fail to see something else: In this situation 
the politicians who are geared toward a struggle with someone or 
something, the "Storm und Drang" politicians, remain unwanted. 
They were irreplaceable when the old system had to be destroyed. 
But because of their lack of specific knowledge they are utterly 
useless in building the Russian state. And it was they who 
needed the stories about plots. Because in a situation of 
mutual suspicion and intrigue they are like fish in water. I am 
more than convinced that playing at plots or countering them is 
an effective means of struggling against unemployment. 
  It is true that this is the unemployment of a quite narrow 
circle of underqualified politicians and just as underqualified 
experts. It was they who organized a festival for themselves 
this week -- a small coup. It is merely a pity that yet again 
they have taken serious people away from their work. And not 
only in Russia but also beyond. 
  But on the other hand this type of escapism, that is a 
departure from reality, is no bad thing for Russia. Of course, 
it costs society a lot to maintain such politicians but they are 
better off playing with their "scenarios." God forbid they try 
to do something for real. On two occasions already this has 
been tried by people who were threatened with idleness. 
Everyone is well aware what came of it.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The Liberal Democrats were 
discussing the local elections in Petersburg today. 
  [Correspondent] About 1,000 Liberal Democrats of the 
north-west gathered in the St. Petersburg Hotel, opposite the 
Aurora on its permanent mooring. Some rows were full of naval 
officers. [passage omitted] Zhirinovskiy was very optimistic 
about the prospects for his party in Petersburg. [video shows 
correspondent interviewing Vladimir Zhirinovskiy] 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] How strong is support for 
you here in St. Petersburg, and what sort of structure do you 
intend to set up here? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Well, the second thing... [pauses] this is 
the 
main assistance for our party in Russia. We have paid a lot of 
attention to Petersburg and the oblast, and today we are holding 
a conference of representatives of [word indistinct] 
organizations, we are appointing a new leadership. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent] The Liberal Democrats, it seems, are taking 
the region seriously. Zhirinovskiy's people have met in St. 
Petersburg at the most critical moment, when it is still unclear 
whether the St. Petersburg city assembly elections will be 
acknowledged as valid. If the elections were to be recognized as 
valid, the Liberal Democrats would not get a single seat in the 
city Duma, and over half the seats would go to 
democratically-oriented blocs.

  [Text] The chairman of Russia's Liberal-Democratic party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy addressed Prime-Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin with a formal request for financial injections now 
that his party finds itself in strained circumstances. A press 
statement released by Zhirinovskiy's party said as much. 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, a political party which carried a 
general election is entitled to get financial and material 
support from the government.(The Liberal-Democratic party polled 
23 percent of overall vote in last December's elections to 
Russia's State Duma - IF). The international community 
recognized his victory, said Zhirinovskiy, and people were 
joining his party en masse in all the 89 regions of Russia. 
  Daily, an enormous number of citizens of the Russian and 
other former Soviet republics addressed the party's headquarters 
with a variety of questions, including political and legal, and 
many people came to visit the party's headquarters. All that 
explained the need for a well-prepared staff under the party's 
60-member Central Committee. 
  In the meantime, the Central and Moscow committees, as well 
as the party's youth wing were headquartered in a building that 
was crying out for repairs. 
  A decision to offer the Liberal-Democrats new headquarters 
and financial aid would, in Zhirinovskiy's view, meet the will 
of most Russians.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lev Rumyantsev] </F>
  [Text] St. Petersburg, 26 March -- Nearly 700 delegates 
from the north-western oblasts of the country have gathered in 
St. Petersburg for a regional conference of the Liberal 
Democratic Party, which was addressed by party leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  "All sorts of plots are presently being hatched against us, 
the special services are onto us, and so we must strengthen our 
unity. At the fifth congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia, which is to be held in Moscow on 2 April, I shall raise 
the issue of strengthening the single chain of command in the 
party," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  Touching on the state of affairs in the economy, he used his 
usual vocabulary to describe the profound crisis, and reiterated 
the lack of talent amongst the country's leaders. Only the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, once in power, can in his 
view offer Russian Federation citizens a better life.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" Article by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy: "When I Am </F>
President..."] 
  [Text] Since the political earthquake caused by the 
parliamentary elections in Russia last September, no politician 
on this planet has been the target of such fanatical media 
interest as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the victorious 
Liberal Democrats. All the songs of hatred that are being sung 
about him seem incapable of stopping his victory procession. 
Last week in Moscow, Zhirinovskiy conducted an exhaustive 
tete-a-tete with former U.S. President Richard Nixon, whom 
President Bill Clinton had sent to the Russian capital to 
discover Zhirinovskiy's real thoughts. Nixon expressed his 
approval of Russia's wish to regain its great power position and 
of its claim for equal treatment. We present, exclusively for 
DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG and DEUTSCHE WOCHEN- ZEITUNG readers, 
an article by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy about his plans as future 
Russian president: 
  The most ridiculous accusations have been leveled against me 
recently, mainly by the German media. I have been accused of 
everything except cannibalism and beastiality, in other words 
sex with animals. If I were to reply to every single abnormal 
insinuation, I would be doing nothing but countering the 
perverse fantasies of press people who have obviously been 
watching too many Hollywood movies. 
  The nationally aware and historically enlightened Germans 
are 
clever enough to know what certain "media" understand by the 
term "truth." But critical-minded persons will notice that, 
despite the fact that the media "report" on me so often, I 
seldom have the opportunity, even in Germany, of uttering a few 
sentences by way of explanation. At the very most, strings of 
words are brought into play meant to "prove" exactly the 
opposite of what I really said. Sometimes my statements are 
mistranslated. Mostly downright lies are said about me. 
  My good German friend Dr. Frey is now giving me the chance 
to 
speak out in plain terms, and without censorship. I am happy to 
take advantage of this opportunity in order to answer a question 
that must beset very many Germans: What is this man Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy going to do when he becomes president of Russia, 
the biggest country in the world? 
  Will I destroy Germany with nuclear bombs or assume 
leadership of the world together with the Germans? People 
accuse me of both, often in the same breath. This is utter 
nonsense. The truth is that I want a strong Russia allied to a 
strong Germany. For this purpose, military strength is also 
required, or else we shall become a banana republic dictated to 
by foreign powers and ridiculed at our expense. 
  Indeed we wish to be fearsome, but only to those who want to 
attack us. I want a Russia that is respected in the world, a 
country that people cannot ignore whenever they want to. I 
envisage good cooperation with Germany in defense technology. A 
new armed struggle between the Germans and the Russians must be 
firmly ruled out. 
  What do I want in industry? As much private initiative as 
possible, as much state interventionism as necessary. We want 
none of the rapacious capitalism where international bosses 
pocket all the money and the masses simply vegetate in poverty. 
I think the social market economy concepts of Professor Ludwig 
Erhard, developed during World War II and implemented in many 
spheres since then, contain sound ideas. 
  As president, I will also maintain the best possible 
economic 
relations with the Germans. We Russians, with our enormous 
natural resources, and the Germans with their know-how are ideal 
partners. A German-Russian economic partnership would certainly 
bring an economic miracle to both countries. 
  Regarding social policy: I do not want a social system in 
Russia in which a wafer-thin minority acquires untold riches 
whilst the man in the street gets nothing. As far as the social 
security system is concerned, the policy of Bismarck is a 
pattern for me. 
  Regarding cultural policy: Here, I want a Russian 
self-awareness. I will certainly oppose the flooding of our 
country with the decadent trash that is showered upon us, mainly 
from the United States. The readers know what I mean, because 
the Germans are also recipients thereof. I am not at all 
concerned with sealing Russia off from foreign cultural 
influences completely, but there must not be an excessive flow 
of this cultural influence. Our great Tchaikovsky combined 
German romanticism with Russian national music, and thereby 
created masterpieces of Western music. That is just one of many 
examples. 
  Regarding foreign policy: He who is peaceful toward us has 
nothing to worry about, but he who wages war on us should know 
that Russia under my leadership will trample every invader 
underfoot. The Russians and Germans could establish an 
invincible defense union. The heroism of German and Russian 
soldiers, so often proved in history, will, together with a 
joint defense policy, frighten off any potential aggressor. 
Bismarck is also an example for me in foreign policy. 
  When the German-Russian partnership I am aiming toward has 
come about, we will be able to discuss Kaliningrad and find a 
solution that conforms to German interests. The territorial 
change to Germany in 1945 was not a final act of history, and 
certainly not a final act of wisdom. 
  Just as his predecessors did before him, President Clinton 
said in his inaugural speech that the United States shall lead 
the world. We have no intention of adopting a similar role for 
Russia. We want a completely sovereign Russia that possesses 
its rightful place in our hemisphere. To quote the great 
Prussian King Frederick II, everyone should be happy in his own 
way. 
  One last word. I am not concerned with delivering empty 
sentences in a manner to which certain Russian and also German 
politicians have grown accustomed. I do not use underworld 
vocabulary that is understood by only a few initiated persons. 
I try to express myself in such a way that my people know what 
I want. The Germans, too, should know that I love my people and 
country above everything else, just as nationally-conscious 
Germans love their nation and their fatherland. If is out of 
this love that I desire eternal friendship between the two great 
western peoples, the Germans and the Russians.

  [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of 
the Russian Federation, speaking on Sunday, denied rumors that 
he had received an offer to become a member of the Presidential 
Council. INTERFAX recalls that reports to this effect have 
appeared in several Russian mass media. They claimed, in 
particular, that there are plans to reform the Presidential 
Council in the near future by also including in it Gennadiy 
Burbulis, Yegor Gaydar, Ivan Rybkin, Mikhail Lapshin, and 
Valeriy Zorkin. 
  Interviewed by the agency, Gennadiy Zyuganov described these 
rumors as an attempt to draw into talks those who oppose the 
elimination of normal systems of government and the introduction 
of a dictatorship. In his view, its introduction is being 
prepared in the country.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Belousov, Dmitriy </F>
Gorokhov] 
  [Excerpt] Murmansk March 27 TASS -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev believes that the improvement of 
legislature and the creation of a favorable investment climate 
all over the country is a way out of the difficult economic 
situation. This was declared during Kozyrev's meeting with 
electors of the Murmansk region who elected Kozyrev to represent 
their interests in the State Duma. 
  In Kozyrev's opinion, the process of transition of Russia's 
northern regions to the market economy is going on slowly. 
During Kozyrev's meeting with electors it was pointed out that 
a canned fish factory and another plant were stopped in the 
region because of economic difficulties. Metal works of the 
Murmansk region and the Kolar nuclear power station have been 
operating to half of their design capacity. It may seem a 
paradox, but Murmansk, a traditional supplier of fish products 
for all Russia, is currently facing serious shortages of marine 
products. 
  The situation on the labour market has worsened as well. 
Every six adult resident of the region is expected to look for 
a job this year. Young people are abandoning northern areas 
which face an increasingly difficult problem of financing. 
  Kozyrev believes that a way out of the critical situation 
can 
be found by improving the legislature which can be applied to 
all northern regions of the country. He calls for better use of 
the regional potential of the Kolar peninsula. [passage omitted]

holding a rally at the Mayakovskiy memorial today. The rally 
was to have been dedicated to defending the people's standard of 
living and preparing for the second all-Russian day of protest 
on 14 April. Even though Moscow's Taganskiy district court just 
a week ago ruled as illegal any ban on holding such meetings, 
the press center statement says, the cochairman of the 
interregional strike committee Sergey Skvortsov was detained and 
taken to militia station No. 10.

  [Text] More and more citizens of Russia believe that the 
return to the communist past is possible, an opinion poll taken 
by the All-Russian Center of Public Opinion Studies (VCIOM) 
among 3,901 residents of cities and villages of the Russian 
Federation in mid- March shows. 
  Thus, according to the data provided by VCIOM to INTERFAX, 
to 
the question "Will the Communist Party be able to become a real 
political force in Russia in future?" in May 1993 15 percent 
said "yes", in March 1994 -- 22 percent. The negative answer 
was given by 59 percent in May, and in March -- 45 percent. 
Those who found it difficult to answer were respectively 26 and 
38 percent. 
  The respondents were also asked: "Will the Communist Party 
be 
able to return to power in future?" These are the answers: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         |May 1993                 |March 1994               | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Yes                      |11                       |17                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|No                       |62                       |45                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Undecided                |27                       |38                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Of those who consider the Communist party's return to power 
possible, half announced themselves supporters of a market 
reform. Experts believe that they do not favor the restoration 
of the old regime.

  [Text] Moscow March 28 TASS -- Russia is neither developing 
nor producing biological weapons, a spokesman for the 
information and press department of the Defence Ministry told 
ITAR-TASS today, following reports in a number of foreign and 
Russian mass media organs, which maintain that Russia is 
allegedly continuing to implement a programme of creating 
biological weapons, specifically new "super-plague", to which 
the West has no antidote. 
  The foreign mass media quote reports of an anonymous 
intelligence source, which maintains that the programme is being 
implemented under the control of the Russian Defence Ministry. 
  In the opinion of experts from the Defence Ministry, it is 
rather astonishing that the forgery, circulated in the West in 
search of a sensation, was thoughtlessly repeated by some 
Russian mass media organs, which had ample opportunity to 
contact specialists and check the correctness of the reports.

  [Text] Moscow 26 Mar, TASS -- Automatic rifle fire near 
strategic missiles reported on 10 March at the Barnaul missile 
regiment posed no threat to nuclear arms, the press center of 
the Russian strategic missile troops told ITAR-TASS today. 
  When on duty near missile launching grounds ethnic-Dagestan 
Private F. Ashurbekov opened fire at the guard, shot two 
servicemen and wounded two others. A special group headed by 
regiment Commander Colonel A. Donets localized and rendered 
harmless the criminal. 
  A statement of the press center said "there was no threat to 
the missile launching grounds, the situation was under complete 
of the command [sentence as received]; the service system and 
control over nuclear missiles in strategic missile troops 
guarantees nuclear safety under regular conditions and in 
various extreme situations." 
  "Missile complexes of the Russian strategic missile troops 
are reliably protected against unauthorized actions of 
personnel. In case of a threat of capture or shelling of 
nuclear arms corresponding measures would be taken. 
  "An order of the strategic missile troops' commander in 
chief 
was issued on the incident and criminal proceedings have been 
instituted. Preliminary information received by the 
investigation shows that Private Ashurbekov has mental 
disorder," says the statement.

  She described as groundless the speculation on the alleged

  In this connection Agapova said that various sorts of rumors 
carried by the media about the Ministry's leadership are being 
spread to deceive the public and to interfere with the

  [Text] Ninety minutes ago, Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk voted in the election of people's deputies of Ukraine 
at polling station No. 4 of the Kiev central constituency No. 
22. After he voted, the chief of state answered several 
questions from Ukrainian and foreign journalists. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent of Russian news agency 
MOSKVA] What kind of new Ukrainian parliament would you like to 
see and where should it lead the country? 
  [Kravchuk] I would like it to be responsible, 
reform-oriented, and professional so that it can lead the 
country along the way of reforms, democracy, friendship, 
cooperation, and partnership with all states of the world, so 
that it will lead the country to good- neighborly relations with 
those countries which are our [word indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [passage indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] I say, we must follow the way of reforms, reforms 
only. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you have a market economy in 
mind? 
  [Kravchuk] A market economy, reforms along the way toward a 
market. There is no alternative here. You know, those states 
which [words indistinct], as they say in Ukrainian [words 
indistinct], they are following the road toward a market. This 
refers to Russia, to Belarus, and to other states. Some of them 
made rather good progress and others were less successful, 
however, they all are moving along the road of reforms. It 
seems to me that this question is connected with the following: 
There are forces which think or understand things differently 
[word indistinct]. But on the whole [words indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Recently you expressed doubt 
that there would be a full-blooded parliament as a result of the 
election. Will you ask for additional legal powers? Will this 
end up with presidential rule? 
  [Kravchuk] Why? I said that parliament, as a matter of 
fact, could assemble if 300 deputies were elected but that it 
would not be a full-blooded parliament because it will lack 150 
deputies. These 150 deputies make up one third of the entire 
number of deputies in parliament, so this means that 12 million 
citizens would not be represented in parliament -- 12 million of 
the adult population or 17 million if we take into account the 
entire population. Therefore, the parliament which does not 
represent the whole of Ukraine cannot make decisions. And then, 
to be frank, let us imagine that there are 300. There would 
need to be an ideal situation for 300 deputies to vote for any 
decision unanimously. It means that constitutional decisions 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, the 
population of Ukraine has been waiting impatiently for this day. 
A new era, so to speak, is beginning in the life of Ukraine. 
Do you link this election with the fact that Ukraine will open 
a new, so to say, page? 
  [Kravchuk] I think today will not yet show whether a new era 
begins or not. This will probably be determined after the 
parliament is elected, if it is elected. I would like this to 
happen. Then, after it assembles and proclaims its concept, its 
program, its attitude toward reforms, democracy, and 
transformations, only after this it will be possible to say 
whether the new era has begun or not. Today this is our wish 
only. I hope the people who come to the polling stations want 
this to happen. Whether this happens or not will depend on how 
they vote, who they vote for, and on the level of responsibility 
of those who are elected to parliament and their attitude toward 
this people. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [passage indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] I think that, no matter how events develop there, 
Crimea will be with Ukraine and will tackle all issues with 
Ukraine. Here is an interesting fact. Water has been supplied 
to Crimea from Ukraine, where they opened the valve, seeds for 
the sowing campaign have been delivered from Ukraine, and 
everything is being delivered from Ukraine. So far... [pauses] 
Not much effort is needed, for example, to reset the hands of 
the clock. Not much effort is needed for this. However, one 
needs to exert efforts so as to switch over to reforms, to 
economic programs. So far, this is a matter of resetting clock 
hands, voting, and so on -- that is to say, this is being done 
so far at the level of political battles. 
  I always say: Let us deal with the economy. Crimea lives 
together with Ukraine. I do not believe that the people of 
Crimea, the population of Crimea, will display an irresponsible 
attitude toward this action [word indistinct]. After all, 
everything will depend on whether reforms develop in Crimea or 
not, whether the life of the people improves or not. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What if the situation becomes 
worse? 
  [Kravchuk] I believe we will not allow this to happen. [end 
recording]

  [Excerpts] Simferopol, 27 Mar -- According to data from the 
Central Electoral Commission, by 1200 Moscow time [0800 GMT], 
531,292 voters, or 26.58 percent of the overall electorate, had 
voted in the Republic of Crimea, Viktor Alsufev, chairman of the 
Crimean Central Electoral Commission reported. According to the 
Commission, the turnout at these elections is lower than in the 
elections for the president of the Republic of Crimea at the end 
of January, when, for instance, by 1200 43.4 per cent of the 
electorate had voted already. [passage omitted] But all of that 
does not give rise to fears and the elections will take place. 
The election turnout in the rural rayons is the highest. There 
are rayons where over 40 percent of the electorate have voted, 
in particular in the Pervomayskiy [Pervomayskoye], Razdolnenskiy 
[Radzolnoye], and Sovetskiy rayons. Almost 20 percent of the 
electorate have voted in the city of Simferopol, and 21.45 per 
cent of the electorate in the city of Sevastopol -- the Black 
Sea Fleet base. 
  As is known, elections to the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine are 
taking place simultaneously in Crimea and their are no instances 
of mass refusal to take part in the elections. A poll is also 
being carried out in which the people of Crimea have to express 
their attitude about Crimea building mutual relations with 
Russia and also about dual citizenship. 
  Sergey Nikulin, spokesman of the President of the Republic 
of 
Crimea on relations with the Central Electoral Commission, 
reported that the poll is being conducted in an organized manner 
and the poll ballot papers are being given out along with the 
ballot papers for voting on elections to the parliament of 
Crimea and the parliament of Ukraine. 
  John Finerti [name as received], the CSCE representative, 
gives the same assessment at the first stage of today's 
elections in Crimea. He said that his first impression from his 
acquaintance with the organization of the elections and his 
visits to a number of polling stations makes it possible to say 
that everything is proceeding as normal so far.

  [Text] Ukraine's parliamentary speaker has criticized 
President Leonid Kravchuk's proposal to postpone the next 
presidential election. 
  Ivan Plyushch said to reporters in Kiev on Sunday that there 
were no reasons to put off the election, scheduled for June 26. 
"This hullabaloo is groundless and pointless. The election is 
feared by those who don't believe they'll be elected," he said. 
  Kravchuk has repeatedly insisted that the presidential 
election be postponed, because, he said, holding it before the 
new legislature convened could lead to a confrontation in 
society and paralyze authority. 
  Commenting on the president's statement that the next 
parliament, to be elected on March 27, may not be a 
"full-blooded" legislature, Plyushch said, "There are too many 
specialists who have not only made an analysis but have drawn 
conclusions as well." "I will refrain from making such 
conclusions." "The parliament will be full-blooded," he said.

in the polls was around 38 per cent, but by 1600 Kiev time, the 
turnout exceeded 60 per cent, and by 1800 local time, 
parliamentary elections had been successfully completed in 16 
Ukrainian regions. 
  The Crimea, the Donetsk and the Lugansk region, where apart 
from elections, the population was polled on a number of 
vitally important problems for these regions, were in the focus 
of attention of the Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission. 
  Officials from the Donetsk and Lugansk regional councils 
told 
ITAR-TASS that questions put on ballot papers of a deliberative 
poll gave more impetus to the polls, encouraging electors to 
express their opinion. As a result, the elections in the 
Donetsk and Lugansk region had been completed by 1800 with the 
registered turnout of 59 and 66 per cent, respectively. 
  Incidentally, acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Yefim 
Zvyahilskyy, who voted in the city of Donetsk, was frank about 
his attitude to a question put to the deliberative poll. 
Touching on Ukraine's relations with CIS countries, he told 
journalists that there is no other way for Ukraine but to join 
the economic union. "We must take part in the Commonwealth on 
equal and mutually advantageous terms and must work on a 
mutually advantageous basis with all CIS countries," Zvyahilskyy 
said. 
  Several hours before polling stations closed today, 
elections 
in 19 Ukrainian regions, including Poltava, Chernovitsk, Rovno, 
Zhitomir, Vinnitsa, Kirovograd, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, Volyn, 
Sumy, Carpathian, Nikolayev, Ivano-Frankovsk, Khmelnitsk, 
Kherson, Lvov, Kharkov, Donetsk, Kiev regions and the Crimea, 
had been completed with the overall turnout of 50.6 per cent out 
of 76 per cent registered electors. 
  According to preliminary reports, the overall turnout in 
parliamentary elections in Ukraine was 60 per cent.

  [Text] Simferopol, 27 Mar -- As Viktor Alsufyev, chairman 
of the Central Electoral Commission of the Republic of Crimea 
said, as of 1600 [1300 GMT], 911,000 voters (46.68 percent of 
the total) voted in the elections to the Supreme Council of 
Crimea. Nine hundred and nine thousand voters took part in the 
elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine. However, Mr. 
Alsufyev stressed that this was the number of those who received 
ballot papers and not those who had dropped them into the ballot 
boxes. 
  According to the personal observation of the Crimean Central 
Electoral Commission, the recommendation by President Meshkov 
for Crimea not to vote in the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council but to take the ballot papers home, was being partially 
carried out at polling stations. 
  The elections to the Supreme Council of Crimea in 
multi-member national constituencies have taken place. By 1600 
71.2 percent had voted in the Crimean Tatar constituency; 63.5 
percent in the Armenian constituency; 45.6 percent in the 
Bulgarian constituency; 57.5 percent in the Greek constituency, 
and 57.9 percent in the German constituency. According to 
information from the Central Electoral Commission, elections to 
the Supreme Council of Crimea had taken place practically in all 
rural constituencies. Viktor Alsufyev said that there had been 
no information about significant violations that could have 
influenced the course of the elections.

  [Text] Over 70 percent of the electorate took part in 
parliamentary elections in Ukraine yesterday. The population 
was most active in western regions. Only in four of the 450 
districts were the elections invalid. According to information 
up to 2100 on 27 March, the elections in Crimea to the Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet were invalid in only one electoral district. 
  INTERFAX says that, according to preliminary information, 
former Supreme Soviet Speaker Ivan Plyushch, Rukh leader 
Vyacheslav Chornovil, former Deputy Prime Minister Viktor 
Pynzenik, and leader of the Ukrainian conservatives Stepan 
Khmara were elected as deputies to the new parliament in the 
first round of voting. Leonid Kuchma, leader of the 
inter-regional reform bloc, got the biggest number of votes, 
with 91 percent. 
  In Kuchma's opinion, the results of the elections, as well 
as 
the situation with the republic's basic law, do not allow 
presidential elections to be postponed to a later date. I will 
remind you that they should take place in Ukraine in June 1994. 
President Leonid Kravchuk has said several times that the 
election must be postponed. He is worried that a power vacuum 
could arise during the presidential candidates' election 
campaign, while the new parliament has still not been formed. 
In his turn, Leonid Kuchma pointed out that this is an attempt 
by the president to delay a civilized turnover in all branches 
of power. 
  The Crimean Supreme Soviet elections were valid. Over 60 
percent of the electorate took part. Simferopol was least 
active of all, while the electoral districts where Crimean 
Tatars and Armenians live were most active. I will remind you 
that a referendum on relations with Ukraine and dual citizenship 
on the peninsula was held simultaneously with the elections. 
The results of the poll are still unknown.

  [Text] Simferopol, 26 March -- The Ukrainian Civil Congress 
of Crimea, the Crimea with Ukraine committee, the Party of 
Crimea's Economic Revival, and the Crimean-Tatar National 
Movement Organization published a joint statement in connection 
with the upcoming poll of Crimean citizens. The statement says, 
in particular: "... Paying no attention to the fact that the 
president of Ukraine has revoked Clauses 1 and 2 of Article 2 in 
Yuriy Meshkov's decree on conducting a poll of Republic of 
Crimea citizens on 27 March 1994, as counter to the Constitution 
and the laws of Ukraine, the poll is about to be held under the 
pressure of chauvinist forces. We consider a poll on the issues 
referring to the jurisdiction of Ukraine's Supreme Council as a 
step towards dangerous confrontation in the relations between 
Crimea and the central power bodies, as a call for continuing 
separatism. The poll will not be conducive to the ideas of 
interethnic concord, friendship and mutual trust, and to 
resolving the problems of the Crimean-Tatar people, but will 
become a serious weapon in the political struggle and will lead 
to even greater deterioration of the situation in Crimea. 
Moreover, any poll without the participation of native 
Crimeans, the Crimean Tatars, cannot be regarded as valid. The 
poll's initiators aim to distract attention from the critical 
situation, from the economic and social problems... The fact of 
conducting a poll itself ... is pushing the people of Crimea 
towards a dangerous borderline. 
  "Therefore, we who stand firm on the foundations of unity 
between Crimea and Ukraine, appeal to Crimeans against taking 
part in the poll and urge local executive power bodies to 
strictly adhere to the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine."

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Refat Chubarov, deputy </F>
chairman of the Majlis of the Crimean Tartars, by Mykola 
Marynenko; Chubarov in Simferopol, date not given -- recorded; 
Chubarov in Russian fading into Ukrainian translation] 
  [Text] [Chubarov] The thing is that our attitude toward 
all kinds of referendums in Crimea, by which influential forces 
are trying to determine its status, was and remains negative. 
We are against such actions because these are attempts to 
decide on Crimea's future without taking into account the will 
of the indigenous population of the peninsula, the Crimean 
Tatars. Therefore, any intentions by influential forces to do 
this by purely arithmetical voting will never satisfy the Tatars. 
  [Marynenko] During the telephone conversation with the 
deputy 
chairman of the Majlis I also recalled the following: When they 
asked Meshkov about his relations with the Crimean Tatars in 
general and the Majlis in particular, he answered that he had 
good contacts with the Crimean Tatars. Many of them supported 
him at the presidential election. As far as the Majlis is 
concerned, in Meshkov's opinion, there is some misunderstanding 
with its leaders only. I asked Mr. Chubarov to comment on these 
facts. 
  [Chubarov] This statement is on president Meshkov's 
conscience because it does not correspond to reality, at least 
judging by the results of the voting of the Crimean Tatars. In 
particular, during the first round we analyzed the voting at 
those polling stations where half or even more electors were 
Crimean Tatars. At these polling stations Bahrov, as a rule, 
was running first, other deputies lagging behind. So, I do not 
trust Yuriy Meshkov's statements of such kind. 
  As far as the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people is 
concerned, president Meshkov has a good idea of the status of 
the Majlis. He has more than once declared that the Majlis of 
the Crimean Tatar people is a real force. The majority of the 
Crimean Tatars support the Majlis and one cannot ignore this 
fact. 
  [Marynenko] My last question to Refat Chubarov dealt with 
the March election in the autonomy both to the parliament of 
Ukraine and to the Supreme Council of the autonomous Crimea 
Republic. I asked him what was the attitude of the Majlis 
toward these elections and the participation of the Crimean 
Tatars in them. Here is the reply by the deputy chairman of the 
Majlis, Mr. Chubarov. 
  [Chubarov] By the way, unlike... [pauses] This is probably 
the only advantage of the Crimean election law. The only 
difference between our law on the election to the Crimean 
parliament and the law of Ukraine on the election to the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine lies in the fact that here in Crimea a mixed 
election system was adopted. We have 66 one-seat 
constituencies. We have 14 deputy seats in a multi-seat party 
constituency and 14 deputy seats in a multi-seat Crimean-Tatar 
constituency. 
  The Crimean Tatars will take part in these elections. The 
Kurultay [congress] of the Crimean Tatar people approved a list 
of 25 candidates for deputies in a multi-seat Crimean-Tatar 
constituency. Altogether four such lists were approved. These 
are the lists of the Kurultay of the Crimean Tatar people, the 
Crimean- Tatar Culture Fund, the National Movement of the 
Crimean Tatars, and the lists of the Culture Center. It is 
noteworthy that the list of the Kurultay and the list of the 
Crimean-Tatar Culture Fund include like-minded people. The 
National Movement of the Crimean Tatars and the Crimean Tatar 
Culture Center also nominated like-minded people, but on the 
other side. That is to say, a polarization of forces is under 
way and the results of the election will, probably, round off 
all the talk on how many Crimean Tatars support the Majlis or, 
for example, the National Movement of the Crimean Tatars.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 26 March -- As we reported earlier, 
President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov appeared on Crimean television 
on 26 March with an address to the peninsula's population in 
which he in fact urged the Crimean electorate to boycott 
Ukraine's parliamentary election. Following the official part 
of the address, Mr. Meshkov added: "Using this opportunity I 
would like to express my view on the 27 March poll as that of a 
citizen. Who will I vote in the election to the Supreme Council 
of the Republic of Crimea? I will vote for candidates of the 
Rossiya bloc. How will I reply to the ballot questions in the 
poll of Republic of Crimea citizens on 27 March? 
  To the first question, "Are you in favor of restoring the 
constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 26 May 1992 which 
determines relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine 
on the basis of treaties and agreements?," I will say "yes". To 
the second question, "Are you in favor of restoring the Republic 
of Crimea constitution of 26 March 1992 which proclaims the 
right of the Republic of Crimea to dual citizenship?," I will 
say "yes". I will cross out the word "no." To the third 
question, "Are you in favor of granting decrees by the president 
of the Republic of Crimea the force of law on issues of 
temporarily unregulated legislation?," I, as a citizen of the 
Republic of Crimea, will say "yes" and will cross out "no." 
  I will take away the ballot paper containing the names, 
first 
names and patronymics of candidates for the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine. I hope that 27 March will come up to the expectations 
we have for this day."

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent S. Milyanchikov, including </F>
recorded comment by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov; from the 
"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] Elections to a new parliament were held in 
Ukraine today. 
  [Milyanchikov] Unlike Russian elections to local councils, 
Crimean elections can be regarded as valid. [passage omitted] 
  Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, who also took part in 
today's voting, believes that the results of Crimean elections 
and of the poll [on relations with Russia] will not spoil 
relations with Kiev. 
  [Meshkov] There are no grounds, no reasons for this. On the 
contrary, the situation is becoming more clear and calm. Mutual 
relations will be settled if we reach agreement and if the Kiev 
leadership shows understanding. In this case all problems will 
be solved. 
  [Milyanchikov] At 2000 Moscow time -- and I will remind you 
that as of today Crimea lives according to Moscow time -- the 
polling stations closed and the count of votes started. Two 
forecasts can be made, however, before all the votes are 
counted. The Russian idea, with which the Russia bloc and the 
Crimea Russian-speaking movement came to the elections, has won. 
And the second thing: In many constituencies, electors will have 
to cast their votes again since more than 1,100 candidates are 
vying for the 90 seats in the Crimean parliament.

  [Text] Simferopol March 28 TASS -- According to preliminary 
results, a majority of Crimeans who came to the polls on Sunday 
voted to support the policy of their president Yuriy Meshkov by 
saying "yes" at a plebiscite which he had initiated, TASS 
learned from reliable sources in the Crimean capital. 
  Official results are expected to be announced Wednesday. 
  The referendum included questions on whether the population 
favours relations with Ukraine on the basis of agreements, on 
dual citizenship on the peninsula and on providing the force of 
law to a number [of] Meshkov's decrees. 
  Local observers note that the affirmative answer to the 
questions means support to the first Crimean president elected 
in January and to his anti-crisis programme.

deputies. 
  The president stressed he does not want confrontation with 
the Crimean leadership, but there is a limit he will never 
overstep -- the integrity of the state. Kravchuk said he 
understands the Crimea's inclination for Russia and Russian 
never-to-be-abandoned interests in the Crimea. 
  At the same time, President Kravchuk reminded of the 
Ukrainian strategy: "There will be no negotiations on borders, 
territorial integrity and sovereignty. The whole world is for 
us and the reaction of the United Nations Security Council to 
the Russian decision on Sevastopol is a vivid example of this 
support. The more so, we have signed a corresponding agreement 
with Boris Yeltsin. 
  "Europeans cannot understand what is happening; don't we 
understand we cannot break borders today, they are holy of 
holies and pillars of European security. That is why we say we 
cannot!" 
  Leonid Kravchuk thinks that an idea of possible co-existence 
of two currency zones in one state is "incompetent." He means 
the idea of the ruble zone declared by the Crimean president. 
  Kravchuk called for the creation of a well-considered 
program 
of the Crimean economic revival with due account of its 
peculiarities and said he and Yevgeniy Saburov are ready to 
achieve assistance of international fiscal organizations. 
  The Ukrainian president praised the Russian economist and 
politician nominated Crimean vice-premier by Yuriy Meshkov and 
said Ukrainian citizenship of Saburov is "not a problem." 
  Asked where Ukraine may unite with Russia in some form, 
Kravchuk said "I think that Ukraine must be together with Russia 
but not subordinated to Russia -- that is all. I have a 
realistic view on facts, there is no other way for Ukraine but 
be together with Russia. We have been together for 300 years 
and it is in our genes. We have had quarrels, weddings and 
unifications amongst our peoples and these relations cannot be 
broken".

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with former Ukrainian Prime Minister </F>
Leonid Kuchma by Arkadiy Romm under the "Hello!" rubric: 
"Leonid Kuchma: The President Would Better Resign 
Voluntarily!" -- date not given] 
  [Excerpt] After the elections for the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council, which are scheduled for 27 March, Ukraine is in for 
early presidential elections. Our correspondent, Arkadiy Romm, 
speaks with former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who is 
considered the most realistic candidate for the presidency. 
  [Romm] Leonid Danilovich, do you really plan to replace 
Kravchuk? 
  [Kuchma] I have not decided yet; first of all I need to see 
what kind of new Supreme Council we will have. If it is similar 
to what we have now, it will be a useless waste of time. I 
cannot find a single good word for what is presently going on in 
the country. The economy has suffered a catastrophe. 
Enterprises have effectively ground to a standstill. The 
credit and economic system has completely collapsed. The 
country is ungovernable: there is no state as such. If we are 
to come out of the crisis, tight measures are inevitable. The 
president must enjoy the overwhelming support of the population. 
  [Romm] What is your assessment of the president's decision 
not to contest the early elections? 
  [Kuchma] The best thing for Leonid Makarovich is to resign 
voluntarily. But will he go? The Kiev authorities do not want 
the presidential elections to take place along with elections 
for the Supreme Council. 
  [Romm] "Independence" has become as popular a buzzword in 
Ukraine as it is painful. What does it mean for you, Leonid 
Danilovich? 
  [Kuchma] As early as last spring I said that we would not be 
able to withstand world prices for energy resources. I proposed 
a number of options. One of them involved the Black Sea Fleet. 
I am certain that if we had been given it lock, stock, and 
barrel, we would have returned it ourselves in a week, because 
we would have been unable to support it. Now developments in 
Crimea are unfolding in such a way that we may be left without 
it altogether. We should have leased the naval armada to Russia 
together with the bases. What we need is a border fleet -- 
Ukraine does not have geopolitical interests in the world ocean. 
  [Romm] What do you, as former chief of a missile-making 
powerhouse, think about a nuclear-free Ukraine? 
  [Kuchma] Stepping the missiles down from alert status is a 
technically difficult and very costly process. According to 
U.S. experts' estimates, this would cost Ukraine $3 billion. 
But I do not want specialists to come here to transport the 
nuclear warheads to Russia, and that is all. This is why I 
opposed the reduction of nuclear arms and the accession to the 
Nonproliferation Treaty at the closed Supreme Council meeting 
last May. Believe me, in general very few people in the world 
knew about a state called Ukraine. The United States' joining 
our disarmament effort has been caused by the fact that the 
parliament made the right decision. There had already been a 
precedent: When we had tactical weapons withdrawn voluntarily, 
we did not receive any political or economic dividends, although 
we had been promised: Just do it and we will start helping you. 
  All our 130 liquid-propellant missiles have had their 
guarantee terms expire. As for liquid fuel, God forbid, I would 
tell you! For instance, we do not have technologies to process 
and to dispose of gertin, a kind of such fuel. Or try to 
neutralize a solid fuel missile. There is no such technology in 
the world yet. The entire range of disarmament problems should 
be resolved comprehensively. 
  As for the signing of the trilateral treaty between Ukraine, 
Russia, and the United States, I have supported it. I think 
that in the long run Ukraine should be nuclear-free. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Parishkura from Kiev under the </F>
"Ukraine" rubric: "Elections Unlikely To Clarify Alignment of 
Political Forces. Democratic Party, Rukh, Communists, and 
Socialists are Front-Runners in Election Campaign"] 
  [Excerpts] Public opinion polls conducted on the eve of 
elections for the Ukrainian Supreme Council have shown that 
question No. 1 for many voters is as follows: "Will a new 
parliament be elected?" This cannot be answered yet. There are 
a number of options. According to the pollsters, from 70 to 87 
percent of the voters plan to turn out for the election. But 
while the elections are held according to the majority 
principle, the voters' preferences vary too much. This is why 
none of the candidates appears to be able to win the requisite 
50 percent of the vote: there are too many contenders for one 
seat, the average number throughout the country being 13-15 
candidates. The second round to be held upon the emergence of 
two front-runners in each district may not take place at all 
because of low turnout: those who voted for a democrat will 
never turn out to elect a communist or a nationalist, and the 
other way around. [passage omitted] 
  There is still only one realistic candidate to the post of 
head of state -- former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who draws 
on support from the director corps and the Interregional Reform 
Bloc [IRB], an organization that is being set up to back his 
bid. This association, also known as the "Kuchma-Grinev" bloc, 
plans to form its faction at the Supreme Council and to set up a 
political party. The IRB, which was created one month ago, does 
not have a clear program and comprises people of all stripes -- 
cautious Rukh members; former nomenklatura, albeit not the most 
notorious ones; and people of artistic professions who are well 
known by themselves. 
  What will happen if the parliamentary elections do not take 
place? Currently rumors are circulating that Leonid Kravchuk is 
going to impose direct presidential rule as the sole head of 
state elected by the entire people. In this case he would need 
a structure to rely upon, and observers think that the 
"Kuchma-Grinev" bloc may well prove to be such a support. At 
any rate, Mr. Grinev himself has not ruled out the possibility 
of cooperating with Kravchuk on certain terms. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vyacheslav Chernovil, leader of Ukraine's Popular 
Rukh, declared that he opposes granting any additional 
authorities to the Ukrainian president irrespective of the 
results of the elections. 
  The press service of the Popular Rukh movement reported to 
Interfax-Ukraine agency that Chernovil declared that "Ukrainian 
president had already enough authorities in 1992 but he has not 
issued any decree which would stimulate reforms." At the same 
time he underlined that "Kravchuk has appointed a great number 
of former communist party functionaries as his envoys in the 
regions, handed over tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, and 
made one concession after another regarding Crimea and the Black 
Sea Fleet." 
  Chernovil is convinced that in case additional authorities 
are granted to the Ukrainian president "a quiet dictatorship of 
oligarchy will be established in Ukraine." 
  On Friday evening Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk voiced 
a statement in which he expressed his intention to address 
Ukraine's Supreme Soviet with a request to grant him additional 
legislative authorities in case not more than two thirds of 
deputies are elected to the parliament. As many as 450 deputies 
must be elected during the elections to Ukraine's Supreme Soviet 
scheduled for March 27.

Here is how President Yuriy Meshkov sees relations with Ukraine 
and Russia. In an exclusive interview with NTV today he said: 
  [Begin Meshkov recording, shown seated at desk in front of 
unrecognized flag] For the time being what we are proposing is a 
kind of legislative initiative. We are appealing to Russia and 
Ukraine to reach agreement on a problem which is common to all. 
The initiative has been accepted by the Russian side and is 
being worked on actively, but unfortunately there has so far 
been no reaction from the leadership in Kiev. How does Crimea 
see herself in this triangle? Of course we would like to have 
an equilateral triangle, although of course the scale is 
incompatible. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Leonid Kravchuk by Ukraine's State </F>
Television and Radio Company correspondents on 25 March on the 
27 March elections to the Supreme Council; place not given -- 
recorded; from poor reception] 
  [Text] [Announcer] President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk was 
interviewed on 25 March by Ukraine's State Television and Radio 
Company correspondents. The subject of the interview was a 
package of issues concerning the forthcoming election to the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine. We are offering a recording of the 
conversation with the Ukrainian head of state made by our 
correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko. 
  [Question indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] I have a sickness called radiculitis, whereby I 
am well, but not too well. That is why I am working at home 
today. By the way I have everything I need to work here, the 
relevant contacts and communications. At work, it is a bit 
difficult, when I look like I swallowed a pole, and I have to 
meet people, so in order not to inconvenience them and myself, I 
am working at home. 
  [Correspondent] [words indistinct] What can you, as a 
popularly elected president, wish the electorate? 
  [Kravchuk] Like the rest of the electorate, I too will take 
part in the voting, and incidentally, I listen to candidates' 
campaign speeches and I understand how difficult it will be for 
the voters to make up their minds. Because the programs and 
speeches are sometimes diametrically opposed, while the 
candidates are too many to make one's choice. But still, [words 
indistinct] because they will need judgement, courage and 
foresight in order to make the right choice, otherwise we will 
wind up in a tight corner. That is why I urge voters to come to 
the polls on the 27th and make their choice. That is, elect 
worthy and intelligent people to the parliament, who will start 
a new stage in the political reform of our society, start a new 
stage in the development of our entire society. 
  [Correspondent] How would you predict the political and 
economic situation in the near future, if the Supreme Council is 
not elected at the first attempt? [words indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] This is a very serious question you are asking. 
But I am prepared for it, and I drew for myself a picture of 
possible options. First of all, I would like to say that, 
regardless of what happens and how, we must consolidate the 
political and non-political conditions necessary to reform our 
society. This must happen irrespective of the election results. 
And it is preconditioned by the fact that we, first of all, 
have no alternative, and second of all, that we have created 
very favorable foreign policy conditions for this course of 
development, and we have to do it. Not to take advantage of it 
now would spell further deterioration of the economic situation 
and especially, a serious decline of our state's authority. 
Therefore, we have to do it, and we probably have no other way. 
But there are (?different) possible options. The first 
option, for example: a new Supreme Council is not elected. That 
is, there is not a sufficient number of deputies to make 
constitutional decisions. In that case, whether you like it or 
not, we must work together with the old Supreme Council. How? 
  [Correspondent interrupts, words indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] Yes, and secondly, we already have the experience 
of this kind of cooperation. At different times it was 
inadequate, but on the whole it is extremely complicated, and it 
was these complications that led to the deterioration of the 
situation where it did not have to deteriorate. How could we 
work with the old Supreme Council, and what is the picture I 
have drawn for myself? 
  The president asks the Supreme Council to postpone, defer 
the 
election scheduled for June. There is every reason to do that, 
as failure to elect a new Supreme Council already means that 
there are problems that cannot be solved (?at once). This is 
the first move. Second, the Supreme Council of the old 
convocation, understanding the situation which has emerged and 
which is actually very serious, assumes a number of powers. 
These are: adopting the constitution and putting it to a 
nation-wide referendum, and adopting permanent procedural rules. 
The rest of the powers concerning the regulation of economic 
relations and legal regulation of the fight against organized 
crime and corruption are handed over by the Supreme Council to 
the president. Thus, both the president and the Supreme Council 
work. Afterwards, the finalized draft of the constitution is 
put to an all-Ukrainian referendum, which is mandatory, because 
you cannot entrust this Supreme Council, after the election, 
with adopting a constitution. You understand what consequences 
this would have. The referendum adopts a new constitution, then 
respectively, laws are passed on elections to local power bodies 
and their structure, and on presidential elections. After the 
constitution is adopted, a new Supreme Council is elected, by 
all means. Until the election of a new Supreme Council, the old 
one is working, and everything is placed on a constitutional 
basis. After this, a new Supreme Council is elected and gets 
down to work. The constitution is there, the power structure is 
there, and all these power structures are elected in a 
constitutional way, a president is elected, and there is no 
political crisis and no chaos in the society. This is the 
option of cooperation with the Supreme Council. 
  But suppose the old Supreme Council does not agree. This 
can happen, we know the difficulties the parliamentarians are 
having, and the problems in the society: the lack of structure 
in the society and in the Supreme Council itself. That is a 
compromise solution, it is a normal solution, and if it is 
rejected, the president is faced with complications. He cannot 
watch society fall apart, chaos take over the political 
structures, another struggle unleashed, which will result in 
further deterioration of the political and economic situation, 
and an end to reforms. The president must find a way and act 
accordingly. 
  What way can it be? The president appeals to the newly 
elected deputies. Suppose, there are 300 of them elected. 
  [Correspondent] That is a quorum. 
  [Kravchuk] It is, but it is not a full Supreme Council, 
because there should be 450. That is, 150 deputies are missing, 
and it is not a full parliament. There is a quorum for 
decision-making, but there is no Supreme Council in the full 
sense of the term. And that is a very important element, I do 
not want people to think that if there are 300, it is a full 
Supreme Council. 
  Together with the Supreme Council, which is not a full one 
yet, he [the president] agrees the following actions: First, a 
decision has to be made again on cancelling the local elections 
in June 1994 and the presidential election, so as to prevent a 
power vacuum, because these bodies would have no constitutional 
status. Second, the president nominates a council, elected by 
the leaders of this elected part of the new Supreme Council to 
grant the president extra powers of legislative regulation. 
This, one can say, would be a Supreme Council. But, as I said, 
not in its full composition. [words indistinct] 
  Due to the lack of definition as to the duties of the 
Supreme 
Council and the level of its relations with the president and 
the government, a number of problems emerge. Again, the number 
one problem is adoption of a new constitution. But, as I said 
before, there is no full Supreme Council. Therefore, we could 
form a new, extended, constitutional commission, including 
regional representatives, experts in constitutional law and 
[word indistinct] and finalize the constitution, but not adopt 
it, because the Supreme Council is not full, and the draft must 
be put to a nation-wide referendum. For this, we need to work 
out a draft law on an all-Ukrainian referendum on the 
constitution, explaining how it should be adopted, and set a 
date for an all-Ukrainian referendum. Next, after the 
constitution is adopted in an all- Ukrainian referendum, the 
door is open for elections to all power bodies, since the 
constitution lays down the political system which is the subject 
of a lot of talk today and solves other problems which need to 
be laid down in the constitution. Then local power bodies are 
elected, presidential elections are scheduled, and again, all 
this is solved in a constitutional way, without any tug-of-war. 
Such are the options. 
  But if a full Supreme Council is elected, then this full 
Supreme Council will act in accordance with [word indistinct], 
common sense and [words indistinct]. 
  [Question indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] The thing is that, according to my proposals, the 
presidential and local elections should be taken off the agenda 
and deferred, until after the constitution is adopted together 
with the relevant laws on the power structure, etc. And in 
those elections which will take place, it is clear that one will 
have to make up one's mind and make a choice. If now, contrary 
to sensible proposals... [pauses] and I do not see any problems 
about them, you just need to think, take your head in your hands 
and see that the period is a difficult one, a period of 
transition, and nothing here (?happens the way one would like 
to), but we are taking a constitutional path, that of adopting a 
constitution and passing the laws, and only then start acting on 
the basis of the constitution and the laws. Thus, legitimacy is 
ensured. As for ambitions, they have nothing to do with 
legitimacy. Everybody must understand this. Nobody wants to 
grab the most. There is a situation, there are problems, and 
there is Ukraine. And we must think in terms of the Ukrainian 
state, of preserving it, of preventing a political chaos, taking 
the economic situation into our hands, that is, preserve the 
state and contain the situation. For this, we need to act 
accordingly. 
  [Question indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] Well, you see, whatever the high policy is, 
however high-ranking one's position may be, it... 
  [Correspondent interrupts, question indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] Well, I cannot talk about it now, I know one 
thing: as long as there is no law on the power structure, and as 
long as there is no law stipulating what kind of president with 
what kind of powers should be elected, it is illogical. You 
cannot put elections first and everything else second. This 
leads to confrontation. That is why people see, first of all, 
that this is missing. They, and I have met many, and many write 
to me, are simply afraid that this may lead to political chaos, 
electing just any kind administration over the economy and the 
political structures, and we know what it can lead to. Some 
may, riding on this wave, take a very irresponsible political 
stand and provoke anything. And people are afraid, knowing what 
it can lead to. That is why they are saying this. They feel 
the situation there better than we do here in Kiev. And 
secondly, they also write that the timing is bad, it is a time 
of spring field work, and in some regions it is already harvest 
time. And [words indistinct] they are working, while in the 
meantime, such a political action as a presidential election and 
election to all power bodies will again [word indistinct] all 
regions, from the village council to the rayon center. 
  [Correspondent] Speaking of regions, Leonid Makarovych, and 
elections in Crimea. Could you comment on the latest decisions 
of President Meshkov as to how they will affect the election to 
the new parliament. 
  [Kravchuk] I spoke about it several times, but will mention 
one more aspect in connection with the election. What would I 
like the Crimeans to understand? And not only the Crimeans. No 
matter how good and promising the president's or anyone else's 
actions may seem today, now matter how well they seem to accord 
with the present situation, you still need to think about 
tomorrow, about the future. And tomorrow, the future, is this: 
Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, and Crimea will live 
together with Ukraine. Perhaps someone may not welcome this 
today, perhaps someone may have other plans. I am talking about 
political forces, not the ordinary worker who is now thinking 
only of peace and well-being, he does not have any other 
aspirations. Another thing is when political storms are having 
their effect. So if you think about tomorrow and the fact that 
Crimea is part of Ukraine, you need to elect deputies to the 
Ukrainian parliament, in order for them to defend Crimea's 
interests. Incidentally, when this parliament was passing the 
law on the division of powers and other documents concerning 
Crimea directly or Ukraine in general, determining Crimea's 
role, they were very active. It is true, and it is 
understandable. Failure to elect deputies to the Ukrainian 
parliament would be a great loss for Crimea. I do not know what 
levers they could use then to affect the passage through the 
Supreme Council of these or those documents directly concerning 
Crimea. This is just one aspect. 
  I want to tell all our Ukrainian citizens at this complex 
moment for Ukraine, at this time of difficulty, aggravated by 
the election campaign and deputies' speeches, the campaign is 
about to stop, and you have 24 hours to calm down, to grasp the 
situation, sit down at the table come up to your children and 
grandchildren, look into their eyes, and ask yourself one 
question: Are they to live tomorrow in peace and harmony, or in 
some other situation? And what do you need for that? Take 
these thoughts to the polls and vote for the people who will 
ensure peace, harmony and the development of an independent 
Ukrainian state.

  [Text] The outcome of the presidential elections in the 
Crimea and the subsequent course of events are acquiring 
particular importance on the very eve of the Ukrainian 
parliamentary elections. Confrontation with Kiev, be it explicit 
or implicit, and gravitation towards Russia are now typical not 
only of the Crimea but of other fairly large parts of the 
Ukraine as well. 
  Representatives of totalitarian trends are bound to appear 
in 
the new parliament, as are their opponents. This is unlikely to 
help reduce tension in the top echelons of power or increase the 
capability of the supreme bodies of state authority. 
  Meanwhile, presidential representatives have been 
outspokenly 
critical of incitement towards separatism, of which they accuse 
the leaders of the Crimea. For example, the head of the 
Ukrainian president's internal policy service, Mykola 
Mykhalchenko, told journalists recently that Kiev is likely to 
have to apply the same measures towards the Crimea as India in 
the Punjab or Great Britain in Northern Ireland.

  [Text] Lvov, 25 Mar -- The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine 
has decided to keep the Ukrainian time one and indivisible. The 
hands of the clocks will be moved one hour forward on 27 March 
in the far east and the far west of the Ukraine. Earlier, the 
state commission for single time and standard frequency came to 
the conclusion that it is inexpedient and disadvantageous for 
the state to introduce two or three time zones in the country. 
  At the same time, Kiev has proposed to regions to introduce 
their own timetable for the beginning of work for enterprises: 
from 0700 hours in the morning for five eastern regions, from 
0730 hours for 11 central regions, and from 0800 hours for five 
western regions. This will allow people to use the light day 
maximum efficiently.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 36: Compiled </F>
by Sergey Logachev, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Mircea Snegur "has a contingency plan" if 
the parties advocating integration into Romania score a success 
in the February 27 elections. A source in the president's 
entourage says that the president keeps his plans to himself 
because he thinks that the probability of an electoral success 
for those parties is merely theoretical. 
  The source told INTERFAX that parties that had recently 
advocated integration into Romania tried to win electoral 
support in the runup to the election by saying they wanted 
Moldova to stay independent. 
  The source also said that the president intended to hold a 
poll on 6 March so as to determine what the country's residents 
were thinking of its independence. 
  The president is sure that the 27 February elections and the 
poll will confirm that his independence course is supported by 
the population. Even though the poll results would not be 
legally binding, Snegur did not doubt that they would endorse "a 
policy of true independence" to be pursued by the president and 
the new parliament. The president hopes that the elections will 
return a solid majority of centrist-minded deputies who will 
work with him in a coordinated and constructive way. 
  Indeed, sociological polls taken in Moldova recently 
forecast 
that over 30 percent of seats in parliament will be won by the 
Agrarian Democratic Party (ADP) which will be followed by 
socialists and social-democrats. The ADP leaders Petru 
Lucinskiy, Andrey Sangheli and Dumitru Motpan will offer the two 
other parties an alliance in parliament. 
  According to the source, Snegur is in a good position to 
discuss the status of Transdniestria with the leaders of that 
area. Snegur has recently received a letter from Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin, saying that Russia is prepared to 
continue to act as a mediator in negotiating a settlement. The 
Moldovan authorities are prepared to discuss with Transdniestria 
a number of compromise options leading to solution of problems 
on which the two sides differ. 
  "Transdniestria could enjoy maximal self-government, going 
as far as legislative autonomy, while staying in the Republic of 
Moldova as its integral part," Snegur believes. 
  Meanwhile, scores of people from the left bank of the 
Dniester (the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic 
-- IF) have arrived in electoral stations set up for them. (The 
Central Election Commission had decided that residents of 
Transdniestria could vote from 21 February to 27 February -- IF). 
  Victor Puscasu, Deputy Chairman of the Moldovan parliament 
told INTERFAX that an exception was made for the residents of 
Transdniestria so that they "express their views independently 
of the Tiraspol leaders." He said that they would be allowed to 
vote even if they did not have a mark in their passport saying 
that they were Moldovan citizens. 
  Officials of the Central Election Commission say that 
hundreds of Transdniestrians have voted on 21 February. The 
elections are reported to run into difficulties, however. 
Voting ballots were still unavailable in some voting stations 
and Transdniestrian guardsmen who patrol bridges over the 
Dniester harass the voters. 
  Activists of some parties are said to tell the voters 
approaching the voting stations who to vote for. They abuse 
their right to continue campaigning. 
  Snegur's headquarters are engulfed by telegrams from the 
south of Moldova. A source in the president's entourage told 
Interfax they protest the ban on opening electoral stations in 
areas where Gagauzi reside, effectively barring over 100,000 
people from voting. 
  Snegur has reportedly decreed that voting stations be opened 
there.

  [Text] Vilnius, March 25, ELTA -- Lithuanian Foreign 
Minister Povilas Gylys received a telegram from U.S. State 
Secretary Warren Christopher in which congratulations were 
expressed for Lithuanian and Polish foreign ministers on signing 
the good neighbourhood treaty. 
  The telegram says that hopefully the treaty will become the 
background of cooperation between Lithuania and Poland and will 
help to achieve stability and harmony in the region. This 
document confirms that the relations will be developed between 
two equal partners. 
  This sets a good example for the whole world, the countries 
of the European Security and Cooperation Conference in 
particular. 
  Despite the complexity of the issues considered, Lithuanian 
determination to achieve the pragmatic compromises determined 
the success of the negotiations, the telegram says.

  [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis received Monday a letter 
from Boris Yeltsin, in which the Russian president confirms his 
readiness to meet in Moscow to discuss bilateral relations. The 
letter was handed over to Ulmanis by Russian Ambassador in 
Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh. 
  A spokesman for the president's administration told Interfax 
that the letter says that now there is an opportunity, through a 
summit dialogue, to improve the relations between Latvia and 
Russia, to strengthen relations in the political, economic and 
social spheres. 
  In the letter Yeltsin outlines his view on the present legal 
status of the Russian-speaking population in Latvia and assesses 
the recent round of the Russian-Latvian negotiations that 
completed in Jurmala last week. 
IF Note: Guntis Ulmanis planned to visit Moscow late in 1993 
and postponed the visit several times. Early this year his 
visit did not take place either, though it was planned. The 
president said this took place partially owing to the incident 
of January 10 in Riga, when two Russian general were arrested 
and there were sharp statements against the Baltic countries and 
Latvia in particular from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and other Russian politicians.

Radio and Television Company programs. The government 
resolution is due to both the contract expiry date and 
Ostankino's debt to Telecom. Government press representative Ain

amounts to 185,000 German marks. Making allowances to viewers' 
requests, Telecom will continue to relay the Mexican television

<F P=106> [Interview with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev by </F>
Enrique Serbeto in Almaty; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The 8 March parliamentary 
elections were regarded by international observers as out of 
keeping with the high level of democratic guarantees. This is 
the first blot on the record of this leader with the reputation 
of being moderate and sensible, who defends himself by saying 
that "when you speak of democracy in central Asia, in 
Kazakhstan, it cannot be compared with France, Spain, or other 
countries. If we are speaking of European standards, it must 
also be said how many years it took to achieve them. It must be 
borne in mind that women in the United States did not have the 
right to vote until the beginning of this century. But these 
states have 200 years of history, and France, Spain, and Britain 
have thousands. We have only been independent for two years. 
We are heading for democracy and the market economy step by 
step. If we try to turn the democratic cart too quickly, we 
will be in danger of overturning it." 
  [Serbeto] The economic reform and privatization are proving 
very difficult in Russia. Has Kazakhstan used the lessons of 
this Russian experience in order to design its own model? 
  [Nazarbayev] After many centuries of totalitarian rule, 
people are accustomed to collective methods of leadership and 
production, and so, from the psychological viewpoint, it is very 
difficult suddenly to accept private ownership. But, despite 
everything, we are prepared to hand over part of Kazakhstan's 
resources to the country's population. We are conducting not a 
chaotic privatization but one under the regulating control of 
the government, which is accelerating the privatization process, 
since it is very difficult from the grassroots. In agriculture, 
we are not yet considering the total privatization of land, 
although this is our medium-term aim. 
  [Serbeto] Are you in favor of the so-called "shock therapy," 
or of delaying radical decisions to the utmost in order to 
preserve social peace? 
  [Nazarbayev] We started with "shock therapy" when we decided 
to liberalize all prices, but we must be very vigilant because 
the process could go wrong at any time. The monetarist 
prescriptions against inflation are not sufficient in 
themselves. In the West, they must realize that they reached 
this situation after many years of evolution. For instance, in 
Spain Franco left everything ready, but we had no Franco. 
  [Serbeto] What is Kazakhstan's nuclear policy? 
  [Nazarbayev] Kazakhstan is fulfilling its pledges for the 
elimination of nuclear weapons. We were the first CIS state to 
ratify START I and the Lisbon protocol. The only delays were 
due to the fact that we were trying to secure guarantees that 
this is our lawful property and that we will be compensated for 
the cost of the enriched uranium in our nuclear warheads. 
  [Serbeto] The presence in this country of a large population 
group of Russian origin is viewed as a factor of instability. 
To what extent do you believe that this is a grave danger to 
coexistence? 
  [Nazarbayev] It would be incorrect to say that this problem 
does not exist. Some Russian politicians wish to use this for 
their own ends, but we will not accept this in Kazakhstan, 
because the Russians of Kazakhstan are our citizens. It cannot 
be said that human rights are violated here, but if anybody 
believes this, we invite all UN delegations to check this. In 
my opinion, people's main concerns are a result of the 
disintegration of the USSR. The fall of a great empire is 
always painful, and so it has always been throughout history. I 
know that Yeltsin and Kozyrev are very experienced people, but 
these politicians should have thought about the Russians left 
outside Russia when they signed the Slav treaty which dissolved 
the USSR. 
  [Serbeto] Why do you not accept the proposal for granting 
the Russians dual nationality? 
  [Nazarbayev] Just imagine if the Russians, who are 32 
percent of the population, had two passports in their pockets. 
They would have one foot in Russia and the other here. That 
would destabilize the situation in Kazakhstan. Why do they say 
nothing in Russia about the violation of the rights of the 
non-Russians living in Russia? A million Kazakhs live in 
Russia. Have they opened any Kazakh school in Russia? In 
Kazakhstan, 65 percent of schools operate in Russian, and last 
year 78 percent of the students starting high school did so in 
Russian. Some 75 percent of the news media are in Russian. All 
the state bodies use Russian, and I myself am speaking to you in 
Russian. Can any other CIS state say that it respects 
linguistic minorities as we do? We will resolve all the 
problems of the Russian-speaking Kazakhs, because this is an 
internal problem of ours -- not that of any other country. 
Nobody can concern themselves about the Russians better than us, 
and we want no assistance from Russia. 
  [Serbeto] Russia is trying to attract other CIS states into 
its military and economic sphere of influence. Have you noted 
this trend with respect to Kazakhstan? 
  [Nazarbayev] Nobody knows what Russia wants. They lack a 
policy in this respect. It would be better to ask the Russians 
what they want. We are a sovereign country and are not 
dependent on Russia for either oil, coal, or food. Since we 
introduced our currency, we have been living completely 
independently, and Russia has understood this. We have oil, 
gas, wolfram, gold, diamonds, and uranium. Russia's relations 
with Ukraine and Belarus cannot be compared with those it 
maintains with Kazakhstan.

  [Text] Moscow 25 Mar, TASS -- The State Duma included in 
the agenda today the issue on plans to unite the monetary 
systems of Russia and Belarus. The proposal of Aleksey 
Mitrofanov, member of the State Duma, was supported by the 
majority of the legislators. 
  The State Duma adopted a resolution by the roll-call voting 
on setting up a commission, which will prepare and hold 
parliamentary hearings, whose topic will be "threat of fascism 
in Russia." Yuliy Gusman from the Russia's Choice bloc, who 
suggested it, said that thugs professing fascist ideology are 
already walking without hindrance by the streets of Russian 
cities. "Today they look like clowns, but if we close our eyes 
to this problem, a situation may emerge, which will mean nothing 
but the revival of fascism," Gusman stressed. 
  Sergey Baburin responded to his words in an original way. He 
said that "the threat of fascism does exist, and it became 
evident in October 1993." 
  On the suggestion of Viktor Zelenkin from the Russia's 
Choice 
bloc the State Duma will hear a report of the group of deputies, 
who visited Vladivostok following the much-publicised removal 
from office of the city mayor. The State Duma decided as well 
to hear a report of a representative of the prosecutor-general's 
office in connection with accusations against Bella Kurkova, 
head of the St. Petersburg TV company.

  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk March 28 TASS -- Elections to the 
Sakhalin regional duma (parliament) were recognised as valid, 
TASS learned from the vote-counting commission on Monday. 
  12 out of 16 duma members have been elected. 
  The polls failed in the southern Sakhalin constituency where 
four duma mandates were competed for. Only 18.3 per cent of the 
electorate came to the polls there. 
  However, the local duma with its 12 members has a quorum 
which enables it to work. 
  Irkutsk -- 45 per cent of the electorate came to the polls 
in 
the Irkutsk region in Siberia to elect the governor, local 
parliament, heads of administrations, cities and towns, urban 
and rural councils. 
  A vote on the main provisions of the charter of the region 
also took place. 
  Current Governor Yuriy Nozhikov retained his post. 
  Elections to local parliament were valid in 42 out of 45 
constituencies, while the polls to local self-government bodies 
were valid in all constituencies. 
  Novgorod -- Elections to local duma were declared valid in 
19 
out of 27 constituencies, according to Igor Zlatin, a member of 
the vote-counting commission. 
  An average of 37 per cent of voters came to the polls. 
  However, elections failed in the regional centre where 
turnout was insufficient in all of its eight constituencies. 
  Eight out of 19 elected members of the new local parliament 
are heads of city and district administrations.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest incidents in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and at 
the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  Several observers are convinced that the intensified 
activity 
of Azerbaijan's military forces at the front lines is linked 
with the multilateral talks that are being held in Moscow with 
the mediation of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. NKR 
experts are also participating in the talks. Obviously, 
Azerbaijan's leaders wish to direct a new wave of pressure on 
the NKR. 
  The NKR Defense Army Headquarters has disclosed that bloody 
clashes took place at several important heights close to 
Alkhanly in Fizulinskiy Rayon yesterday. Some 38 Azerbaijani 
officers and men were killed and dozens of troops were wounded 
in the fighting. Azerbaijan also lost military equipment and 
armored vehicles. One of its T-72 tanks and a rocket launcher 
were destroyed. Two men were killed and 11 others were wounded

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 56 (546); </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky, Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Islam Karimov has ordered a range of 
measures to tighten control over the observance of the country's 
tax and customs laws. 
  His decree published in the local press instructs the state 
taxation committee to bring criminal charges in cases of tax 
evasion, illegal exports and other offences damaging to 
Uzbekistan's economic interests. 
  Prosecuting officers, the security services and interior 
ministry are instructed to speed up investigation into offences 
related to tax evasion and illegal exports so that no culprit 
goes unpunished. 
  In one other decree, Karimov ordered an improvement of the 
country's banking system and stabilization of financial and 
crediting relations. Banks are told to finalize the 
installation of computers by 1 October. 
  The decree also envisages the introduction of computerized 
postal services ensuring an automatic stock taking of available 
cash and prevention of illicit payment or crediting operations. 
Uzbekistan is planning to tighten crediting and monetary 
policies and bring an end to easy term government credits to 
different sectors of the economy. 
  In this connection, the government has given local banks 
four 
weeks in which to study the experience gained by leading world 
and CIS banks before submitting proposals on how to readjust 
local bank operations to market requirements.

  [Excerpt] United Nations, 26 Mar -- [Passage omitted: The

Georgian-Abkhaz conflict to be resolved peacefully] 
  Speaking at the session, Yuliy Vorontsov, the Russian 
permanent representative at the United Nations, noted that on 21 
March the Government of Georgia had expressed its readiness to: 
Broaden the political and legal status of Abkhazia and, with 
the aim of giving this status real content, to delimit the 
competencies between the bodies of state administration of the 
Republic of Georgia and Abkhazia, including investing the latter 
with exclusive powers. This position adopted by Georgia is an 
important prerequisite for success at the talks, Yu. Vorontsov 
stated. 
  The Russian representative also went on to point out the 
importance of both sides' having before them the prospect for 
the institution of a UN peace-keeping operation, which both the 
Georgian and the Abkhaz sides urgently requested.

  [Text] [Crimean] President Meshkov's decree on Crimea's 
independent military policy is illegal, and for this reason its 
implementation would be against the law. This is said in a 
statement released by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry's 
press-service on March 24. The statement notes that "Crimeans 
must be drafted, Ukrainian troops be deployed, and servicemen be 
trained in line with the Ukrainian Defence Ministry procedures 
and in the interests of Ukraine's defence potential." 
  "Pressure by President Yuriy Meshkov on the Crimean Army 
Commander and open threats are inadmissible," the statement 
notes. 
  According to a decree earlier signed by Meshkov, Crimean 
citizens will be drafted for service exclusively on the 
territory of the peninsula.

  [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, welcomed 
Russia's willingness to promote resumption of talks aimed at 
resolving the Abkhazian crisis. "I am pleased to say that the 
Russian leaders promptly responded to my letter and expressed 
their concern over the latest aggravation of the conflict in 
Abkhazia," Shevardnadze told the Georgian news agency in 
response to the appeal made public by the Russian leadership on 
March 26. 
  According to Shevardnadze, "the Abkhazian forces recently 
started a large-scale offensive in the Abkhazian mountains, 
resulting in scores of killed and wounded on both sides, notably 
women and children." He said that "especially dangerous were 
also new attacks on Georgian villages on the banks of the Inguri 
River" as a result of which 200 families from the village of 
Okurcha, Zugdidi District, had joined the thousands of refugees. 
  Shevardnadze warned of the possibility of a new escalation 
of 
the conflict and added, "We support the Russian proposal on 
resuming the talks and are prepared to join them in Moscow very 
shortly." 
  He was convinced that Russia "was capable of exerting active 
influence and playing a positive role in resolving the Abkhazian 
problem, notably in resolving the most painful issue - the 
return of over 300,000 refugees."

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "New Clash Between Russian and </F>
Ukrainian Diplomats -- This Time in New York. Despite Kiev's 
Objections, the CIS Receives Observer Status in the United 
Nations"] 
  [Text] Debates at the 48th session of the UN General 
Assembly, which has resumed in New York, were marked by yet 
another clash between Moscow and Kiev. In the last two years 
the world has managed to get used to the fact that the two 
largest Slav states appear in the role of antagonists in 
international forums with enviable constancy. 
  The discussion of the question of conferring UN observer 
status on the CIS was no exception. Vladimir Khandogiy, the 
Ukrainian representative, issued a hard-hitting statement that 
took the Russian delegation by surprise. He resolutely objected 
to the recognition of the Commonwealth as a subject of 
international law and as a regional organization which could 
carry out peacekeeping operations. 
  This position radically contradicts Russia's approach. 
Moscow is insistently seeking international recognition of the 
CIS, and it was mainly thanks to its efforts that the issue of 
granting the Commonwealth UN observer status was included on the 
agenda of the 48th session. 
  Replying to Khandogiy's speech, Russia's permanent 
representative to the United Nations Yuriy Vorontsov stated that 
Ukraine's objections are "due to its being insufficiently 
informed on the character of the Commonwealth and the agreements 
between its members." In his words, the treaty which is the 
legal basis of the CIS' peacekeeping activity was signed between 
Commonwealth members -- including Ukraine -- 20 March 1992 in 
Kiev. 
  Despite Ukraine's peculiar position, the CIS nevertheless 
received observer status, which as of today is possessed by 
three regional organizations -- the European Union, the Arab 
League, and the Organization of African Unity. The resolution 
to this effect was adopted by the General Assembly without a 
vote. 
  Commenting on Kiev's position, a high-ranking Russian 
diplomat did not rule out that Ukraine's new hardline approach 
is connected with the forthcoming elections to the republic 
parliament. By going against Moscow and once more stating their 
skeptical attitude to the CIS, it is possible that the Kiev 
authorities are counting on attracting the votes of supporters 
of Ukrainian independence -- mainly in the republic's western 
oblasts. 
  However, Ukrainian diplomacy's New York demarche could 
produce an undesirable effect for Kiev in regions with a 
Russian-speaking population, first and foremost in the Crimea. 
Inhabitants of the peninsula have received fresh confirmation 
that the Ukrainian leadership is not seeking rapprochement with 
Russia. This could fuel anti-Ukrainian sentiments and affect 
the results of the poll on the status of the Crimea scheduled 
for 27 March.

<F P=106> [Olga Solomonova report under "View of Situation" rubric: </F>
"What Kind of Union in Place of the `Inviolable' One? Notes 
From Interparliamentary Assembly Session"] 
  [Text] The fourth plenary session of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly [IPA] of the CIS states was held in 
St. Petersburg last week. 
  The assembly legally came into being two years ago, when the 
speakers of the parliaments of seven countries of the former 
Union signed an agreement setting up the IPA. In actual fact, 
however, it came into being last year. But I believe that the 
Russian Supreme Soviet's stormy activity last year overshadowed 
everything, leaving in the memory of readers no definite 
attitude toward the international parliamentary organ. 
  To all appearances, the assembly is now breaking out of its 
zero cycle. Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the IPA Council, has 
very actively set about building this institution of 
interparliamentary cooperation -- a process that is as yet 
unusual for the parliaments of our independent states. 
  What is the essence of the IPA's work? It does not adopt 
binding decisions, just statements, appeals, proposals, and 
recommendatory legislative acts relating to the CIS states' 
common problems. These problems are not becoming any fewer. At 
the same time integration processes are gathering momentum in 
the Commonwealth countries, and there is a growing desire for 
concerted actions. 
  Now, as distinct from 1991, positive changes in relations 
among the peoples of the countries of the former Union really 
are being felt. The Commonwealth's international organs -- the 
Councils of the Heads of State and Government -- have now been 
operating for more than a year. They adopt decisions and reach 
agreement on economic integration and recently, for example, 
they adopted the treaty setting up the Economic Union.... 
  But, however many agreements presidents and governments 
reach, each state has its own laws, customs offices, currencies, 
borders, etc. It is only possible to surmount these obstacles 
and coordinate actions by formulating common rules and bringing 
the CIS countries' legislation closer together. Here the role 
of the IPA in joint norm-creating activity is inestimable. 
  "We are at the head of the legal process," Shumeyko 
declared, 
emphasizing the assembly's role in creating the Commonwealth's 
common legal area. Incidentally, the day after the 
parliamentarians' session the international conference "Civil 
Codes of the Commonwealth States: Harmonization and Modeling" 
opened in the same place, in the Taurida Palace. 
  But does this modeling, not to mention harmonization, do any 
good for people? 
  Only in the long term. The assembly's chairman believes that 
it must get down in earnest to elaborating social policy and 
prepare some common document like the social charter of the 
Commonwealth states, which would clearly designate a unified 
system of social guarantees for citizens living in the CIS. 
  Here there is also the problem of refugees, the possibility 
of free movement from one state to another, the ensuring of 
personal safety and safeguarding of property, the prevention of 
any discrimination whatever when employing people and paying 
them, guarantees of pension provision when changing the country 
of residence, etc. 
  What, after all, was decided at the assembly's last 
session, in which delegations from the parliaments of eight 
Commonwealth countries participated: Azerbaijan, Armenia, 
Belorussia [Belarus], Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan], Russia, and Tajikistan? 
  The parliamentarians adopted 17 decrees: on the IPA's role 
and tasks in strengthening the Commonwealth, on peacemaking 
actions, the drafting of a model civil code, legal backup for 
the ecological safety of internal reservoirs, recognition of 
higher education diplomas, on the drafting of legislative acts 
in the fight against crime, on a list of recommendatory 
legislative acts governing economic relations within the 
framework of the Economic Union, etc. 
  Just one of the drafts proposed by the IPA Council -- on the 
impermissibility of a blockade of Commonwealth members -- was 
not adopted. This happened because of disagreements between the 
parliamentary delegations from Azerbaijan and Armenia. But it 
is assumed that at the next session it will be possible to reach 
a consensus on this question too, since a special commission has 
been set up to work it out under the chairmanship of M. 
Sherimkulov, speaker of the Kirghiz Supreme Council. 
  A question naturally arises: If all the decisions the 
assembly adopts are of a recommendatory nature, then surely its 
activity cannot have serious consequences? 
  It is hard to say whether there will be any practical 
benefit 
from these decrees. Not only is the assembly not able to 
influence the CIS governments and parliaments by virtue of its 
consultative nature, but neither does it have a mechanism for 
monitoring the implementation of its own decisions. 
  This is undoubtedly the chief difficulty -- to embody even 
some of the decrees in legislation. There is no need to recall 
the difficulty with which laws are adopted in the Russian 
parliament and, evidently, in others too. How much more 
difficult is it to bring closer together the lawmaking processes 
in national parliaments? No mechanisms, no experience.... But 
without this, all the noble impulses of the heads of state and 
government will remain just good intentions. The Economic Union 
will run the risk of remaining a paper union only. 
  The IPA's headquarters in the Taurida Palace could become a 
factory of legislative daydreams unless a different status is 
accorded this norm-creating process. 
  In the opinion of observers, the assembly at present is 
merely a good platform for contacts among parliamentarians and 
communication among the political elites of the CIS, something 
like a corridor of trust.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 29 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on 
Kazakhstan president's visit and Russo-Kazakh summit talks: 
  "Already now one can speak about a new quality of 
Russia-Kazakhstan relations. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who is, 
perhaps, the strongest politician among CIS presidents, proved 
to the Kremlin these months which are far from being a 
honeymoon, that it is necessary for Russian to reckon with him. 
[sentence as received] 
  "Besides, experts united in praising the successes of the 
Kazakhstan president's Western tours, including his visit to the 
United States. 
  "Of course, there is a way to `neutralise' Nazarbayev by 
undermining stability in his coutnry -- and some in Moscow 
already tried to do that. 
  "However, no other country in the world should be more 
interested in a strong and stable Kazakhstan than Russia, since 
the newly-independent state has become the most reliable buffer 
between Russian and explosive Central Asia. 
  "It is now Kazakshtan, not Russia, that `keeps the shield' 
between Europe and Asia while setting an example of well-wishing 
cooperation between the two continents on one territory". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on Nazarbayev's visit: 
  "Life itself unavoidably prompts our two countries to 
cooperate. If the leaders of Russia and Kazakhstan succeed in 
laying a political basis for joint work, transnational 
financial-and-industrial groups may well become the locomotive 
which will haul the economies of the two countries from the 
crisis." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) on the Baykonur future: 
  "The social welfare sector functions and spacecraft are 
launched due to Russia's space defence forces. The world-known 
space port is almost completely maintained by Russia. 
  "But it is noteworthy that while Russia has been maintaining 
Baykonur, Kazakhstan was conducting negotiations on how to 
entice either the United States or Ukraine into leasing it. It 
was not fortuitous that at first there was talk in Alma Ata 
[Almaty] that the 1992 agreement does not accord with 
Kazakhstan's interests. Later on, there emerged an idea of 
establishing an international consortium on the basis of 
Baykonur with no prospects for Russia's advantages either over 
ex-Soviet republics or the other space-faring nations headed by 
the U.S." 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA on a Cossack picketing of Kazakhstan 
embassy: 
  "The Cossack Union arranged the picketing of the embassy of 
Kazakhstan. The picketing coinciced with Nursultan Nazarbayev's 
arrival in Moscow. B. Suprunyuk, leader of the Russian 
Community of Northern Kazakhstan, and V. Latynin, ataman 
(chieftain) of the Moscow branch of the Cossack Union, handed 
over a message, addressed to the presidents of the Russian 
Federation and Kazakhstan, to the embassy. 
  "The message points out in particular that participants in a 
recent roundtable meeting in Omsk on the subject `the problems 
of the Russians in Kazakhstan and of Kazakhs in Russia' believe 
that Kazakh laws and the consitution have wrongfully divided the 
country's law in provisions concerning the `indigenous' and 
`non-indigenous' population. The Russians in that republic are 
denied dual citizenship. Kazakhstan is the world's only country 
where the activities of the Russian community, Cossack and 
Slavic associations are banned juridically." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russian First 
Lady Naina Yeltsin who said, in particular: "Reading newspapers, 
one gathers the impression that Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin] 
does not want people to live a better and easier life. But how 
can this be done for everyone and at once? Who will find a 
magic way to turn millions of people into millionaires? Alas, 
no such programmes have been suggested". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the Komsomolets nuclear-powered 
submarine which sank in the Norwegian Sea five years ago: 
  "A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea is more than 
probable. This is an ecologicl time-bomb which may go off in a 
matter of days, not months or weeks. 
  "In the event of multiple discharges of plutonium from the 
sunken submarine's nuclear missiles -- such discharges may 
continue for several years -- strong underwater currents, which 
in the area reach a speed of 1.5 metre per second and which 
change their course several times a day, would lead to a rapid 
contamination of several thousand square kilometres of the 
seabed. Considering that plutonium's period of semi-decay is 
24,000 years, the sea in that sector would turn out to be unfit 
for fisheries over a span of 600-700 years". 
  TRUD runs an interview with Yuriy Shchapov, deputy chairman 
of the Committee for Economic Reform, who said as follows: 
"People who are now in power at all levels do not want, 
naturally, to lose it. What can they do to secure that? First 
of all, to impose a state of emergency and introduce a 
dictatorship. The president is unlikely to become a dictator.... 
  "The second way is to stir up inter-regional conflicts which 
may lead to a civil war. Neither the former nor the latter 
should be allowed to happen." 
  PRAVDA on coup rumours in Russia: 
  "A coup scenario has been regarded too gravely in the top 
echelons of power in Russia. Political detection came into play 
right away... 
  "Those who assumed the emergence in their minds of designs 
which were read prior to realisation reacted anxiously and 
painfully to the coup scenario".

  [Text] Uzbekistan observes UN norms and does not interfere 
in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. This was stated at a 
press conference in Moscow today by that country's ambassador in 
Russia, Yusuf Abdullayev. The statement was made in light of an 
accusation made against Uzbekistan by the Afghan president, 
whose representative recently visited Moscow. In particular, it 
was alleged that the Uzbek side was interfering in the internal 
Afghan conflict by supplying weapons to the forces of that 
country's rebel Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and his 
allies. The Uzbek diplomat rejected such an accusation and 
emphasized that what happened in Afghanistan was the internal 
affair of the Afghan people. At the same time, the ambassador 
confirmed that in accordance with agreements Uzbekistan was 
indeed rendering aid to the northern regions of Afghanistan. 
This aid, however, was purely civilian in character. Last year 
electric power to a value of $14 million was supplied and about 
100 joint Uzbek-Afghan enterprises were set up. This was 
reported by ITAR-TASS.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] Uzbekistan does in no way interfere into the 
internal affairs of neighboring Afghanistan. "The Afghan 
allegations on this score cause sincere indignation in 
Tashkent," Uzbek ambassador to Russia Yusuf Abdullayev said at 
a news conference in Moscow Monday. 
  He recalled that Hikmat Abdurrahman, special envoy of the 
Afghan president, had recently paid a visit to Moscow where he 
visited, in particular, the Uzbek embassy. "The Afghan official 
expressed concern over some `interference' into Afghan affairs 
by Tashkent and the secret talks that had allegedly taken place 
between Uzbek leaders and Uzbek General Rashid Dostam. 
Uzbekistan did receive Dostam last August but not as `a rebel 
Afghan general' but as a special envoy of the Afghan president. 
The meetings were held officially and openly. There were no 
below the board dealings. All insinuations by the Afghan 
authorities are outrageous." 
  The Uzbek ambassador denied Abdurrahman's allegations that 
Tajik opposition fighters underwent training in Uzbekistan. 
Only a Martian cannot see that this is untrue. These 
inventions of the Afghan authorities cause surprise," Abdullayev 
said. 
  Abdullayev said that his country "faithfully observed the 
principle of respect for sovereignty of other countries and 
non-interference into their own affairs. Uzbekistan is an 
island of stability, calm and civic peace in the volatile 
Central Asian region. Resolving the Afghan situation is one of 
our primary concerns," Abdullayev declared. 
  He said that "the Soviet leaders ignored the lessons of the 
three Anglo-Afghan wars. As a result, the Soviet action there 
had an ignominious end. We have too many common roots with 
Afghanistan to forget such things. Nobody has succeeded in 
dismembering and subjugating Afghanistan. It would be strange 
if we tried this," the ambassador said. 
  He said that Uzbekistan had traditional good relations with 
Afghanistan's northern provinces inhabited chiefly by ethnic 
Uzbeks. "This is normal cooperation with neighbors which does 
not imply attempts at capturing the area," Abdullayev said. 
  In his words, "Uzbekistan's interference into Afghan affairs 
amounted to supplying $13.8 Mn [million] worth of electricity 
to Afghanistan while 300 Afghan students graduated Uzbek 
universities free." 
  Asked by INTERFAX about the outlook for a settlement in 
Tajikistan, Abdullayev emphasized, "The sooner Dushanbe and 
opposition sit together, the better. We in Tashkent think that 
all parties in the conflict should be legitimately participants 
in the talks. Simultaneously Tajikistan should develop closer 
ties with its neighbors, otherwise no outside aid would be 
helpful." 
  He expressed the hope that Afghanistan would tangibly 
contribute to resolution of the Tajik crisis. "At least we would 
like to believe what Kabul officials say about this," he said.

  [Text] President Karimov considers as inefficient 
transformations in some republic's industries. Addressing in 
Tashkent the government meeting, he said that the chemical and 
machine-building industries are working inadequately. 
  The president has leveled criticism at the managers who 
believe that the disruption of economic ties among the Republics 
of the former Soviet Union is the reason for the production 
slump. He believes that these leaders do not take advantage of 
the economic possibilities opened lately due to the Republic's 
transfer to the free market relations and inadequately use the 
reserves and rich resources of Uzbekistan. 
  The president said negligent leaders of enterprises and 
industries have found a good niche. The president is 
particularly concerned by the fact that the nostalgic sentiments 
have not become a thing of the past in some places. Karimov 
believes that many leaders continue working without due account 
of peculiarities of the market and interests of the Republic. 
The president is sure that the use of outdated forms and 
methods makes it impossible to build a state with a great future.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Grigoriy Kolodin: "The Manat Has </F>
Prompted Respect for...the Ruble"] 
  [Text] Turkmenia -- It has been nearly five months since 
the introduction of the national currency in Turkmenia -- the 
manat. That is certainly long enough to consider the initial 
results of the circulation of the new money and what effect this 
unavoidable step has had on the country's economy. It was 
indeed unavoidable, although banknotes and coins manufactured 
beforehand in Britain, were ready and waiting, but the 
government thought that at that time Turkmenia was not yet fully 
prepared for the switch to its own currency. It was only when 
it became obvious that the Russian authorities were planning to 
force their CIS neighbors out of the ruble zone that Turkmenia 
accelerated the introduction of the manat. 
  November was a month of euphoria and...empty pocketbooks. 
The exchange of citizens' savings was carried out in such a way 
as to drastically reduce the money supply. However, even with a 
mere handful of coins in his pocket, a person felt quite 
solvent. For 5 kopeks (that is what people here habitually call 
the small change -- the tenge) you could buy the latest 
newspaper or eat a bread roll, and for 20 you could buy a loaf 
or stick of wheaten bread. With 2 chervonets, you could buy 10 
eggs, some green vegetables, and a couple of kilograms of 
apples. Potatoes cost 1 manat, and, just as in the good old 
days of stagnation, traders would stick cardboard price tickets 
into their piles of late melons, saying "1 melon -- 1 ruble." 
And although, after the first pay packets were issued in the 
new money, the Turkmens learned to count their small change in a 
new way, for an average wage of 400 manats you could not only 
feed yourself, but also buy, say, a pair of Italian shoes for 
110 manats or a washing machine for 120 manats. 
  Alas, November and December, when the family budget was 
"tight" but you could fill a bag with food products for a small 
sum, are remembered here today as months of plenty and days of 
bright hopes which, unfortunately, are not yet fated to become 
reality. In Turkmenia it is still not the custom to publish 
information on the inflation rate or to calculate the cost of 
the consumer basket, but every inhabitant of the Republic can 
see for himself every day how life is growing increasingly 
expensive. Meat prices in the bazaars have risen from 5 to 50 
manats a kilogram, the cost of fruit and vegetables has also 
gone up, for the third month in succession the shelves of stores 
selling industrial products are practically empty, and in the 
few commercial stores the prices are certainly not suited to 
people who are living only on a wage. And without the 
continuing government subsidies on flour and bread for the 
population, so that bread still costs 20-30 tenge, without the 
free provision of electricity, natural gas, and water and the 
very low cost of housing, of sending children to preschool 
institutions, and of travel on public transport, things would be 
very tight indeed for the Turkmens. 
  It is certainly not the manat as such that is to blame for 
the fact that the Republic, which in all previous years had a 
deficit-free budget, is today spending more than it receives. 
The financial hole in the state's pocket was caused by the huge 
debts of the former brothers in the Union for natural gas 
supplied in the past year. It is no joking matter that 
Turkmenia is owed $1.5 billion by Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, 
and the other CIS countries -- a shortfall of nearly 380 
"greenbacks" for every local inhabitant. The main debtors -- 
Ukraine and Georgia -- asked for their last year's debt of $700 
million and $200 million respectively to be classified as a 
Turkmen Government loan. Their wishes were accommodated, but 
the first two months of this year elapsed without either Ukraine 
or Georgia keeping its promise -- to pay for gas every 10 days. 
It was necessary to resort to extreme measures and close the 
valves on the pipelines to Ukraine. But apparently the 
Ukrainian authorities are today more worried about the purely 
internal political struggle and the disastrous decline of their 
own economy. 
  President Saparmurad Niyazov and his team are intensively 
seeking a way out of the crisis situation. Preparations have 
been stepped up for the implementation if the plan for a gas 
pipeline which will convey Turkmen natural fuel via Iran and 
Turkey to Europe. The possibility of pumping gas through 
Afghanistan to Pakistan is being examined. A major reform of 
the agrarian sector is under way: More than 50,000 hectares of 
formerly unused land has been handed over to private ownership. 
  But for the moment the manat remains a sideshoot of the 
dollar and the ruble. Its real rate is falling rapidly. Having 
ostensibly been set as equivalent to 50 cents and 500 Russian 
rubles in November, today it only runs to 1 cent and 20 rubles. 
The lack of Russian currency in the banks has been a severe blow 
to state and business structures, which are 80 percent "tied" to 
Russia. Contracts are being broken, former links are being 
lost, and business circles can be heard increasingly frequently 
dreaming: "If only we were back in the ruble area! We cannot 
survive without Russia yet..." 
  As for survival, this is, of course, a slight exaggeration. 
But common sense and the example of Belorusia [Belarus] 
suggests that it is not a question of what picture there is on 
the banknotes, but of preventing them from degenerating into 
pretty colored candy wrappers.

  [Text] "Russia has military strategic interests in 
Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] which we must respect. They do not go 
against our independence. At the same time, we have the 
strategic interest of being together with Russia and cooperating 
with it in the military sphere. This does not contradict the 
interests of third countries," Turkmen President Saparmurad 
Niyazov told the Military Council, speaking about the military 
doctrine. 
  To quote Niyazov, Turkmenistan's military doctrine is of 
purely defense nature. Giving preference to legal, economic and 
other non-military means of settling conflicts, Turkmenia will 
adhere to the principle of "positive neutrality and 
non-interference in the internal affairs of other states." 
  According to the doctrine, Turkmenia will not treat any 
state 
as a potential enemy. Nor will it join any military bloc, or 
keep foreign troops on its territory. (However, after his 
speech, Niyazov welcomed Russian specialists' participation in 
the development of the Turkmen armed forces -- INTERFAX). 
  Turkmenistan will be a nuclear-free state and will not equip 
its troops with weapons of mass destruction. 
  The main sources of danger threatening Turkmenistan are 
local 
conflicts, the threat of using weapons of mass destruction, 
attacks on Turkmenistan's facilities, border conflicts, military 
buildup in the neighboring countries' border regions and 
international terrorism. 
  Priority is given to the broadening of military cooperation 
with the neighboring states, above all Russia. 
  According to the doctrine, an army grouping is to be created 
in Turkmenistan and a mixed procedure of shaping the armed 
forces (contracts and drafting) is to be introduced. The 
Turkmen armed forces are to be reorganized by 1999. Priority 
importance will be attached to the air-defense units, and to 
"rapid forces capable of fast re-dislocation. 
  Niyazov said that the Turkmen armed forces' strength would 
be 
within the limits of reasonable sufficiency -- 37,000 men. The 
current armed forces will therefore be cut down by 2000 men. 
  The program for reorganizing the defense ministry, announced 
on 1 January, provides for establishing a defense and security 
council led by the president. The Council will also consist of 
Vice Premier Boris Shikhmuradov (deputy head of the Council), 
the heads of the local administrations, the leaders of the power 
ministries and the ministers of justice and foreign affairs. 
The Council will analyze the situation in the Republic and 
provide recommendations. 
  The president also proposed setting up a general staff (375 
members), a staff for the armaments and the rear (225 members, 
and the command of the air force, air defense and land troops. 
  Niyazov welcomed cooperation with the Rosvooruzheniya 
(Russian arms industry) corporation and announced that a center 
for repairing helicopters and factories for the production of 
military clothes and footwear would be built. He said that in 
exchange for supplies, the Rosvooruzheniya will receive 6 Bn 
cubic meters of gas.

Zuhurov, who has been appointed head of the government

in an interview with a correspondent of the Khovar news agency 
  Zuhurov stressed that the whole population of the country is

these talks were going to take place sooner or later. Our 
people are famous for their feelings of friendship and foresight 
over the centuries. It is no secret that the United Nations, 
the Russian Foreign Ministry -- in the person of First Deputy 
Minister Adamishin -- and some other international organizations 
rendered great assistance to us. 
  I would like especially to point out the position of Emomali 
Rakhmonov, the head of state and chairman of the Supreme Council 
of Tajikistan. He has several times announced at the highest 
forums that the leadership of the country was ready for talks. 
  Speaking about the main aims of the talks, Shukurjon Zuhurov 
expressed the opinion that it was expected to discuss the issues 
related to stabilization of the situation of the republic, in 
particular the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, in the 
course of the talks. The government delegation includes 10 
representatives of all the regions of the republic. It is 
expected that the inter-Tajik talks will take place in the 
capital of the Russian Federation in April of the current year.

  In some areas along that part of the border, which is close

  "We believe Sangheli and Luchinski are will be able to cope

on the ticket of his party. 
  He said the main items on the agenda of the session of 
parliament beginning on Tuesday will be the draft constitution, 
the status of the Dniester river valley and areas populated by 
the Gagauzi as well as the election of the speaker and his 
deputies. He also felt that a set of economic matters would 
also be discussed. 
  On interaction with the opposition the majority leader said 
that his party is ready to take part in drafting a law on the 
opposition. "Such a law is necessary, there should be an 
opposition, but the principles of its functioning should not be 
anti-government," Motspan believes.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev 29 Mar, TASS -- The new Moldovan 
parliament, which was for the first time elected on a 
multi-party basis, met here today. It includes 104 parliament 
members. Most of them (56) represent the Agrarian-Democratic 
Party, which won the February 27 elections. The Agrarians hold 
that the parliament should first of all adopt a new 
constitution, create a legislative basis for economic reforms, 
and resolve the Dniester and Gagauz problem by granting a 
special legal status to those territories. 
  The bloc of Socialists and the International Movement adhere 
to a very similar stand. They won 28 parliament seats due to 
the backing of the Russian-speaking population. Without calling 
in question the proposals of the Agrarian-Democrats, the 
Socialists believe that the parliament should first of all 
ratify all the agreements on the Commonwealth of Indepenent 
States (CIS) and on the economic union, should stop state 
language tests, feared by the non-indigenous population. 
  They will be opposed by the Christian-Democratic People's 
Front and the bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals, a group which 
has split away from the front. They both call for unification 
with Romania. The front and the group have lost the trust of the 
electors and now have only nine and 11 parliamentary seats 
respectively. The split-away group is headed by ex-speaker 
Aleksandr Moshanu. These parties oppose the ratification of the 
CIS agreements, regarding them as an "attempt to revive the 
Soviet empire". However, the 20 seats they have in the new 
parliament will not give them a chance to effectively influence 
Moldova's policy. 
  Petr Luchinskiy, one of the leaders of the 
Agrarian-Democratic Party, which has won the parliamentary 
elections, is expected to be elected parliament speaker. He is 
54 years old and had formerly been first secretary of the 
central committee of the Communist Party of Moldavia and 
secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. Last year, after an 
acute parliamentary crisis, he was elected speaker of the 
previous Moldovan parliament. However, it was impossible to 
save that parliament which was elected during the Soviet period 
and which was torn asunder by contradictions. It had to be 
dissolved ahead of schedule.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman </F>
Mechyslaw Hryb at the signing ceremony of the Belarusian 
Constitution in Minsk on 28 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed Prime Minister, Supreme Soviet Presidium 
members, deputies, and journalists! 
  We have invited you to participate today in the solemn 
signing of our first Constitution -- the Constitution of the 
Republic of Belarus -- which we adopted at the 14th session of 
the Supreme Soviet on 15 March. I have repeatedly noted that 
the Constitution was worked out during two and a half years with 
the participation of all members of the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium, who also acted as members of the Constitutional 
Commission. Also participating in the work on the Constitution 
were the majority of our deputies, the government, leading 
lawyers and scientists of our Republic, and the voters, who came 
forward with many proposals and remarks after the draft 
Constitution was published in the media. All this was taken 
into account, and it contributed to the adoption of the 
Constitution in the present form. 
  I would like to point out that this Constitution emphasizes 
and protects civil and human rights for the first time. The 
Constitution, for the first time in the Republic of Belarus, 
defines our political system. It has pronounced that Belarus 
will be a presidential republic. Tomorrow, we will debate 
legislation concerning elections of the first president of the 
Republic of Belarus. 
  The Constitution, for the first time in history, approves 
the 
Constitutional Court, which has not existed in our public life, 
and includes an entire range of other proposals. 
  Therefore, before signing the Constitution, I would like to 
congratulate all members of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the 
government, all people's deputies, people who participated in 
the work, and all citizens upon the adoption of this important, 
basic law in the life of our Belarusian people. I believe that 
the Constitution will become the first, extremely important step 
toward strengthening the independence of our state -- the 
Republic of Belarus.

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Larisa lazar for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk 28 Mar, TASS -- Belarus has applied to the 
Inter- parliamentary Union for membership. 
  Belarusian Parliament Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb did not rule 
out the possibility that the request may be granted in the near 
future. This will allow belarus to attend the second conference 
of the Inter-parliamentary Union to be held in September as a 
full member. 
  The announcement was made at a news conference in Minsk on 
Monday. Hryb spoke about the participation of a CIS 
Inter-parliamentary Assembly delegation in the first conference 
of the Inter-parliamentary Union in Paris. He noted that full 
membership of this organisation is very important for Belarus 
from the political point of view because it will enable it to 
draw the attention of the international community to its needs 
and problems, including the cleaning up of the aftermath of the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. 
  Asked if he had discussed in Paris with Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the Federation Council of Russia's Federal Assembly, 
the integration of the monetary systems of the two countries, 
Hryb replied in the negative. He noted that these matters are 
the prerogative of the executive bodies of power -- the 
governments of Russia and Belarus. 
  Hryb voiced concern about the present situation which has 
paralysed industry and trade. "Further delays in this issue 
will do no good to either side. If it cannot be done this way, 
we must work out a new bilateral agreement -- a comprehensive 
treaty between the two states," Hryb said. 
  He stressed that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has 
already made up its mind -- it has set up a commission led by 
First Deputy Parliament Chairman Vyacheslav Kuznetsov to work 
out such an agreement.

  [Text] The Republic has applied for membership in the 
Interparliamentary Union. It is not ruled out that this request 
will be satisfied in the near future, and as early as September, 
a Belarusian delegation will be able to participate as a full 
member in the Second Conference of the Interparliamentary Union. 
This was announced today by Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw 
Hryb during a news conference devoted to the results of the work 
of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's delegation at the First 
Conference of the Interparliamentary Union in Paris. He pointed 
out that the joining of the world's oldest interparliamentary 
organization by Belarus will be very beneficial in a political 
aspect, because of the possibility to draw more global attention 
to the problems of our Republic, including those connected with 
dealings with the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. 
Answering a question as to whether he discussed in Paris with 
Vladimir Shumeyko any possible scenarios for uniting monetary 
systems [with Russia], Mechyslaw Hryb answered in the negative. 
According to him, talks [on this topic] are in the competence 
of the Executive Branch -- namely, the Governments of Belarus 
and Russia.

  [Text] Belarus's defense minister has denied his 
involvement in the illicit operations of businesses run by his 
ministry. 
  Colonel-General Pavel Kozlovskiy told INTERFAX in an 
exclusive interview that he was going to ask the law-enforcement 
authorities to carry out a proper investigation and, after its 
results are made public, to bring a defamation of character suit 
against Aleksandr Lukashenko, head of the Provisional 
Parliamentary Anticorruption Commission, who accused him of 
illegal dealings. 
  Kozlovskiy said some of the executives in Defense Ministry 
companies had indeed committed offenses, but that all of them 
had been "punished." 
  He said Lukashenko's accusations were groundless because, 
"following the logic of Lukashenko, formerly manager of a state 
farm and nowadays chairman of the Commission for Fighting 
Corruption, he himself could have been dismissed from his rural 
managerial post immediately after an anonymous report came in 
that a pailful of formula feed had been stolen from one of his 
pigsties." 
  "The defense minister cannot be responsible for the behavior 
of each soldier and officer of the Belarussian army, which is 
nearly 100,000 strong, any more than a factory manager can bear 
personal responsibility for the personal integrity of each of 
his workers, of whom there may be many thousands," Kozlovskiy 
said, describing Lukashenko's accusations as "an attempt to draw 
the army into political intrigues and destabilize the situation 
in the Republic during the presidential election campaign." 
  Asked whether the Defense Ministry needed to have its own 
businesses, Kozlovskiy said the funds the Armed Forces were 
receiving from the state were "clearly insufficient." "In order 
to keep the army from being ruined and strangled financially we 
are forced to use, for example, the potential of transport 
aircraft for the commercial transportation of cargo," he said. 
  Meanwhile, the prime minister's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin 
told INTERFAX another five members of government accused by 
Lukashenko of various offenses were going to bring defamation of 
character suits. They are Deputy Premiers Nikolay Kostikov and 
Stanislav Bril, Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko, Minister of 
Foreign Economic Relations Vladimir Radkevich, and National Bank 
Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich.

Berndt Wiltz told a BELINFORM correspondent. He visited our 
Republic as head of a German Defense Ministry delegation. The

between the two states. As a result of this visit, a joint 
communique was signed on the continued development of military 
cooperation. The communique point outs that intensive contacts 
aimed at improving security and military cooperation are 
regarded by the two sides as a constructive contribution to 
international stability and peace according to the UN statute,

  [Text] Head of the interim Anti-Corruption Commission of 
the Belarusian Parliament Aleksandr Lukashenko has accused Prime 
Minister Vyacheslav Kebich of helping himself to government 
funds to finance his own campaign for the presidency. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX in Minsk, Lukashenko said his 
commission had evidence that the prime minister was trying to 
"syphon off part of government resources to commercial banks." 
  The official also maintains that Kebich started his 
unofficial election campaign six weeks ago by suspending local 
subsidies and agreeing after private meetings to provide them 
with regional administrators in exchange for a promise to back 
his candidacy. 
  Lukashenko also said that the Prime Minister had already set 
up his own election office on the basis of existing government 
structures.

Armed Forces will hand over the Daugavpils fortress to the local 
authorities in mid-April, the city's deputy mayor, Grigori 
Merkuryev, told reporters. 
  The fortress housed the High School of Aviation Engineers, 
which was sent Russia in August, 1993. The compound, which 
includes living houses, store houses and fuel depots, is still 
guarded by a 200-men unit. 
  The both parties have already coordinated the terms of 
handover, said Merkuryev. Under the draft agreement, the 
Russian Defense Ministry will temporary continue the ownership 
of the living houses.

  [Excerpts] Riga, Mar 28, BNS -- Latvia's parliament and 
non-parliament right parties keep protesting the anticipated 
troop withdrawal treaty between Latvia and Russia what they call 
is legalizing of Soviet occupation of the Baltic country. 
[passage omitted] 
  On March 26, several parties and public organizations 
reiterated that, in their opinion, the agreement undermines 
Latvia's security and sovereignty, and pressured President 
Guntis Ulmanis not to sign the document. 
  The Saeima (parliament) should never ratify the agreement in 
the present edition, they said. 
  The group includes the Latvian National Independence 
Movement, the Tevzeme (Fatherland) National Association and the 
Latvian Popular Front. 
  The National Independence Movement (LNNK) urged Ulmanis not 
to confirm the draft because "the signature of these agreements 
would mean Latvia's enclosure into the sphere of Russian 
interests, endanger Latvian sovereignty and chances for the 
national survival." 
  The initialed agreements contradict the CSCE and UN 
declarations on the complete and unconditional withdrawal of 
ex-Soviet troops, according to the statement. The accord on 
Skrunda was, in fact, reached by the presidents of the United 
States and Russia without consent of Latvian citizens. 
  "Accepting the initialed agreements, Latvia actually fails 
to 
resolve issues connected with troop withdrawal" while "armed 
Russian servicemen may freely move in the Latvian territory, 
thus, posing a threat to the Baltic security," said the document. 
  LNNK wants the Saeima (parliament) to first adopt a law on 
the status of aliens and stateless persons, foreign policy 
concept and an appeal to the United Nations on the occupation of 
the Baltic states in 1940. 
  Letting occupation army officers stay here, Latvia 
voluntarily gives up its earlier claim for the recognition of 
its occupation. By doing so, Latvia also lifts the 
responsibility for Soviet-era damages of Russia, the party said. 
  The Saeima should form a new negotiation team for talks with 
Russia to tackle withdrawal issues, repatriation of former 
Soviet colonists, return of the Abrene (now Pitalovo, Russia) 
district to Latvia and compensation for occupation damages. 
  LNNK also wants to Saeima to accept its proposal for the 
organization of nationwide referendum on the functioning of the 
Skrunda radar after all Russian troops leave Latvia. The 
attitude of Latvian citizens toward granting social guarantees 
to retired Russian military persons would be another question at 
the referendum. 
  If the Saeima rejects these demands, LNNK will propose 
extraordinary Saeima elections. 
  Similar demands are included in a statement by Fatherland's 
congress. Association member, MP Roberts Milbergs described the 
document as "a document of despair" saying that the issue (of 
the ratification of Latvian-Russian accord) is actually 
determined. 
  Popular Front's board member Juris Kokins told BNS that, if 
the international community recognized Latvia's occupation in 
1940, Latvia could turn for help to international organizations. 
  Fatherland plans to stage a rally March 29 at the Cabinet 
building to protest signature and ratification of the Latvian- 
Russian agreements. The Cabinet is scheduled to look through 
the initialed documents on the same day.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 28, BNS -- The agreement on social 
protection for military pensioners, which Russia and Latvia 
initialed, may complicate the course of Estonian-Russian 
negotiations, Parliament Speaker Ulo Nugis said today after a 
meeting with a Latvian Saeima (parliament) delegation in Tallinn. 
  The parliamentary press service told BNS the principal 
objective of the Latvian delegation was to coordinate positions 
on key questions of the Estonian-Russian and the Latvian-Russian 
negotiations. Latvia and Russia initialed an agreement on 
military pensioners that perplexed Estonian politicians. Since 
the troop withdrawal agreements must be ratified in the 
parliament, the Latvian Saeima delegation wanted to find out 
Estonia's standpoint on the pensioners' issue. 
  In Nugis' opinion, the Latvian MPs "would have liked to take 
advantage of Estonia's critical position to build up a similar 
attitude in the Latvian parliament." Nugis stated, however, that 
Estonia will not officially condemn Latvia's position. 
  "This is Latvia's domestic issue, but we don't rule out that 
it may complicate the future course of Estonian-Russian 
negotiations," Nugis said. "Estonia, however, is not going to 
change its position or make any concessions on this issue," the 
parliament speaker emphasized. 
  In Nugis' words, the standpoints of the Estonian delegation 
for talks with Russia are consistent with the aliens law, which 
regulates also the problems of social guarantees for the retired 
Russian military, and the citizenship law. 
  "Latvia at present lacks analogous legislation," Nugis 
noted. 
  The Latvian Saeima delegation met also with Prime Minister 
Mart Laar and Rein Helme, chairman of the parliamentary National 
Defense Commission. 
  The delegation included Maris Budovskis, chairman of the 
Saeima Credentials Committee and the Baltic Assembly Presidium; 
Juris Sinka, chairman of the Baltic Assembly foreign affairs 
committee and a member of the Latvian delegation for talks with 
Russia; Romans Apsitis, a member of the Saeima Law Enforcement 
Commission; and Baltic Assembly secretary Ance Anteniske. 
  The meeting between the Latvian delegation and Nugis touched 
on the next session of the Baltic Assembly scheduled for May in 
Riga, as well as the initialing and ratifying of a cooperation 
agreement between the Baltic Assembly and the Benelux countries 
(Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg).

  [Text] The government is of the opinion that Russia has 
begun an economic war against the Baltic states. The 
government's press service states that beginning 15 March, 
Russia implemented extremely high customs tariffs on Estonian, 
Latvian and Estonian [as received] goods, tariffs that are 
double what has to be paid on other countries' goods. 
Instructions to this end were issued by a Russian Federation 
state committee on 11 March. Riigikogu economic commission 
chairman Ivar Raig, thinks that Estonia should raise the issue 
at the international level, while Prime Minister Mart Laar 
thinks that an economic war against the Baltic states will harm 
Russia first and foremost because a lot of agricultural produce 
will not be supplied. 
  Commenting on the Russian decision, the prime minister 
regrets that Russia does not want constructive and 
goodneighborly relations with the Baltic states. Foreign 
Minister Juri Luik is amazed that Russia would implement 
discriminatory customs duty payments against other countries, as 
it has voiced a desire to become a member of GATT, the 
international trade agreement. Juri Luik stated that this is in 
sharp contrast with GATT principles. 
  According to Prime Minister Laar the Russian decision to 
double customs duty on Baltic goods in comparison to goods from 
other European countries has demonstrated that the course 
adopted by the Estonian Government to orientate the Estonian 
economy toward the West is the only correct one. He stated that 
Estonia is not dependent on Russia, and for this reason Estonia 
has nothing to fear. Those few producers who, as the government 
press release notes, orientated themselves unilaterally toward 
the eastern market must, according to Laar, simply reorganize 
their production.

  [Text] According to the preliminary results of registering 
of inhabitants conducted in the north western Estonian town 
Paldiski, a former Russian submarine training base, over six 
thousand people live there, Estonian Minister of Population 
Peeter Olesk told ETA on Monday [28 March]. 
  In the course of registration that lasted from March 22 to 
25, 3,684 registration questionnaires were fulfilled. In 
addition, a list of 892 Russian military and their families is 
in the possession of Estonian Government. Children up to 16 
years were inscribed in the questionnaires of their parents and 
their exact amount, estimated at about one thousand, will be 
clear after the questionnaires are analysed. Another thousand 
people did not, for some reason, appear at the registration. 
Olesk added that people that did not register themselves will 
have difficulties in moving in the town when the dismantling 
work of the nuclear reactor at the former military base will 
start and people that do not have a registering inscription in 
their documents or do not possess a special permission to be in 
the town, will be detained until their identification is 
determined. 
  Up to now the exact number and composition of population in 
Paldiski, largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and 
Russian military, was not known, for the former town 
authorities, subject to Russian military authorities and 
dissolved by a law adopted by Estonian Riigikogu [parliament] on 
March 9, refused to hand over data on the subject.

  [Text] The EU-Estonian free trade talks in Brussels were 
successful and the main text of the agreement has been agreed 
upon, Estonian Ambassador to the EU Clyde Kull said. 
  Both parties recognise in the preamble that the final aim of 
the agreement is Estonia's full integration to the EU. The free 
trade regime on industrial goods as well as general trade and 
customs principles have been agreed upon and the negotiations 
have reached the most sensitive subjects - textile and 
agriculture, Kull went on. He added that the EU had made some 
concessions concerning possible use of customs duties by Estonia. 
  The experts are to meet in Tallinn on April 12-13, while the 
next meeting of the delegations is to take place in Brussels on 
April 27.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys in </F>
Vilnius by Nikolay Lashkevich; date not given: "Lithuania Does 
Not Claim Kaliningrad Lands, Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys 
Says"] 
  [Text] Kaliningrad Oblast, which is separated from the 
motherland by hundreds of kilometers of Lithuanian territory, 
has become a source of tension between Lithuania and Russia. 
  The people of Kaliningrad complain about the border and 
customs barriers being erected by Lithuanian functionaries, and 
of the problems of providing the oblast with all the essentials; 
the Lithuanians complain of the militarization of the oblast, 
and some influential Lithuanian politicians are unable to 
renounce territorial claims. 
  But what is the stance of official Vilnius on the 
"Kaliningrad question"? Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas 
Gylys replies to IZVESTIYA. 
  [Gylys] First of all I wish to officially state that we have 
no territorial claims against Russia. We do not aspire to 
Kaliningrad lands. The position of the Lithuanian leadership 
should be separated from that of individual politicians. The 
problem lies elsewhere -- the oblast is one of the most 
militarized regions in Europe and perhaps in the world. 
Therefore, I hope, Russia will understand our concern. 
Lithuania would like to have guarantees of its security. On 
the other hand, Russia is undoubtedly seeking to maintain vital 
links with Kaliningrad Oblast. 
  [Lashkevich] The problems of the transit of Russian Army 
troop trains, it would appear, could seriously spoil relations 
between the two countries. Everyone well remembers incidents of 
troop trains being delayed on the Lithuanian border. In this 
way suspicion, wariness, and ill-will arise. It is obvious that 
the issue of the transportation of military equipment and arms 
from Kaliningrad Oblast and back should be resolved urgently. 
  [Gylys] We have received proposals from Russia on this 
account. They are being discussed. The main thing is that 
these military transit shipments should not present any danger 
for us, either on the criminal level (contraband and trade in 
narcotics, weapons, and metals) or on the ecological or 
political levels. Let me stress that Lithuania, in advocating 
the demilitarization of the oblast, opposes the use of pressure, 
let alone threats, in official policy. We do not feel any 
aggressive aspirations from Russia or any real threat from that 
country, and we hope that Russia will adhere to the concomitant 
tactics of political behavior. 
  [Lashkevich] Russian citizens complain of the difficulties 
they experience while traveling through Lithuanian territory. I 
have seen letters from Kaliningraders denouncing the arbitrary 
behavior of Lithuanian customs officers and functionaries. What 
does Lithuania plan to do to ensure that obstacles are not 
placed in the way of the free movement of citizens? 
  [Gylys] Inhabitants of Kaliningrad Oblast can travel to our 
country without visas -- on the basis of residence in 
Kaliningrad Oblast, which is indicated on their identity cards. 
It is possible that visas will be introduced in the future, but 
here too there are plans to alleviate the transit problems of 
Kaliningraders; we will perhaps introduce a system of annual 
visas. It is not in our interests to close the borders. 
Kaliningrad trains include separate "Lithuanian railcars," in 
which railroad officials try not to accommodate transit 
passengers. These cars are inspected, but the others are not. 
However, today we are not guaranteed against people without 
documents, in pursuit of self-seeking goals, including of a 
criminal character, alighting in Lithuania by making use of the 
transit line. There are already examples involving arms 
smuggling. In the case in question our delegations need to 
reach agreement on the technical questions. This concerns also 
the movement of economic freight. 
  [Lashkevich] Until now it appeared that Lithuania would 
avoid the fate of its Baltic neighbors, which are quarreling 
with Russia over border posts. However, the example of the 
conflict situation over the DF-6 oil deposit near Nida covered 
recently by IZVESTIYA suggests the reverse.... 
  [Gylys] As far as borders on dry land are concerned, both 
sides are essentially close to signing the relevant agreements. 
But in the Baltic Sea.... Here our positions greatly differ. 
We hope that the forthcoming round of talks will help to settle 
this dispute. What worries us? Russia has begun oilfield 
development work and thereby presented Lithuania with a fait 
accompli -- the deposit is ours, they claim. Meanwhile work has 
begun in the disputed region. Let me stress, I would not wish 
to declare that this section of the sea belongs to Lithuania, 
but I would not like to prematurely recognize it as belonging to 
Russia. This is yet another hotbed of tension which could rouse 
political passions in our country. Let us first resolve the 
juridical aspect of this question, and then, if the need arises, 
tackle the exploitation of the deposit. 
  [Lashkevich] You constantly call for the negotiations 
process to be intensified. But talks are proceeding very 
lethargically. Why is this? What are the immediate prospects 
for dialogue? 
  [Gylys] We must place dialogue on a firm, permanent footing. 
We are ready to talk to Russia on any topic, and will strictly 
uphold our obligations. But what is stopping Russia from 
responding on a mutual basis is not for me to judge. In 
November, as is well known, we signed a treaty on 
most-favored-nation status in trade. And what happened? It 
does not need ratification. All that is needed is to exchange 
diplomatic notes on the fulfillment of treaty obligations. 
Russia did not send its note. I cannot rule out that political 
passions will soon flare up in Lithuania and people will begin 
to say: Here we see the true face of Russia. This is not to 
the benefit of our relations.

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 466] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, March 28, ELTA -- President Algirdas 
Brazauskas told a news conference on Monday [28 March] the 
co-ordination of actions of the three Baltic presidents was a 
necessary condition to get closer to the political, economical 
and security structures of Europe. 
  A lot of attention in the meeting of the three presidents 
was 
paid at the co-operation with Visegrad countries. 
  Estonian President Lennart Meri offered a concept 
"Northern-Southern axis". This would mean a formula "5+3+4" 
(five Nordic, three Baltic and four Visegrad states). Estonian 
and Latvian presidents appreciated ratification of 
Lithuanian-Polish international treaty. This agreement is a 
step towards Europe, especially that Poland is an associate 
member of the European Union. Those who contradict signing of 
the treaty with Polish President Lech Walesa in April in 
Vilnius, are serving the isolationist policies. 
  Estonian and Lithuanian presidents also appreciated 
ratification of four Latvian-Russian agreements. Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis told the summit there were various as 
well as contrary opinions about them. The step made by Latvia 
may be useful also for Estonia which is to begin a new round of 
talks with Russia in April, Brazauskas said. 
  Although the Baltic presidents confirmed an agreement on 
their regular summits and co-ordinated activity, the Baltic 
council was not created. Such a council, similar to the Nordic 
Council, should involve broader - parliamentary and governmental 
- structures. 
  They agreed to arrange agreements on various issues, e.g. a 
free trade agreement which is to come into force in April 1. On 
the governmental level, an agreement on social guarantees for 
citizens of any Baltic state working or studying in the other 
Baltic state, will be arranged.

  [Text] In his traditional Monday interview to the 
Lithuanian radio, President Brazauskas has expressed indignation 
over Western media-made accusations of Jewish genocide against 
the whole Lithuanian nation. Mr. Brazauskas said that every 
nation had its own criminals, but nobody can accuse and describe 
a whole nation as a criminal entity. This was the underlying 
principle of international law and everyone must keep to it, 
said the Lithuanian president. 
  Mr. Brazauskas stressed that the Jewish genocide was 
organized and carried out by Nazi Germany on occupied 
territories. Therefore, Mr. Brazauskas did not see the 
Lithuanian nation as the initiator of the mass murder of the 
Jews. It is true that 8,000 Lithuanians had participated in the 
mass killing of Jews, but compared to the Lithuanian population 
of 3 million in those times, the total percentage of war 
criminals was very small. Mr. Brazauskas pointed out that 700 
out of 50,000 persons were refused rehabilitation papers, while 
five rehabilitations were annulled after additional information 
had been received by the prosecutor's office.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 28, BNS -- Ratification of 
Lithuanian-Russian treaties by the Russian parliament was 
discussed in Moscow last Friday [25 March] at a meeting between 
Romualdas Kozyrovicius, Lithuanian ambassador to Russia, and 
Vladimir Podoprigora, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee 
of the Russian Federation Council, the upper house of the 
Russian parliament. 
  The two discussed possibilities to ratify in the Russian 
parliament an agreement on mutual legal assistance and a 
consular convention, both of which were signed in Lithuania in 
1992 and have already been ratified by the Lithuanian parliament. 
  Lithuanian and Russian officials also exchanged views on the 
implementation of a bilateral agreement on the most favored 
nation trade status and prospects to expand the Kaliningrad free 
economy zone. 
  Podoprigora said the legal assistance treaty and the 
consular 
convention will be included among the priority treaties to be 
ratified by the Russian lawmakers.

<F P=106> [Statement by former Defense Minister Audrius Butkevicius to </F>
Lithuanian Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas, issued 21 March; 
under the "Opinions" rubric] 
  [Text] To Lithuanian Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas 
  I have found out that seeking to conduct a search in my 
apartment, authorities twice searched the home of my 
sister-in-law in Vilnius, Ciurlionis Str. 86-92. Currently, I 
keep some of my personal things there while away for my studies 
in Great Britain. I am surprised and indignant that both 
searches were carried out with the following aims: "To find and 
retrieve documents linked with the purchase of military 
facilities, as well as arms, notes, and so on, and to find and 
retrieve documents bearing importance to the case, as well as 
arms, ammunition, and explosives." 
  These motives for searches surprise me and cause my 
justified 
indignation. You, as prosecutor general of the Republic of 
Lithuania, should know as well as myself that I did not commit 
any crimes as defense minister. These are not my speculations 
or wishes to you, but demands of Lithuanian laws to those 
officials who must institute criminal proceedings and conduct 
the investigation if there is a sufficient legal basis for this. 
Before bringing the action No. 09-02-005-94 against me on the 
abuse and negligence of my duties in acquiring arms, you had to 
make certain whether there had really been any proof of crime in 
my actions as national defense minister, and whether there was 
enough evidence to justify such a conviction. Therefore, before 
undertaking the investigation, you had to conduct a thorough 
examination and begin proceedings only after that. Without 
performing this, but by conducting searches, you insulted my 
honor and dignity as a Lithuanian citizen and a former 
responsible state official. You did not even talk to me. 
  Instituting ungrounded proceedings, you have completely lost 
the feeling of legal responsibility and your behavior follows 
the rules of the recent party elite and nomenklatura -- give us 
a person and we will find a law to punish him. Do you need to 
be reminded, Mr. Prosecutor, that those times have passed? 
Unfortunately, all events in this case have shown that you do 
not follow the legal requirements of the Republic of Lithuania 
in your work. Therefore, by ordering the conduct of searches, 
you had no legal justification to think that the aforementioned 
apartments contained the evidence of the crime unknown to you, 
but which is already under way, and things received or acquired 
in a criminal manner or documents that could be important for 
the criminal proceedings instituted by you. 
  I state openly and publicly that your actions against me are 
unlawful. Since the current institutions of supreme power in 
the Republic of Lithuania, which appointed you prosecutor 
general, are clearly indulgent to you and do not react to my 
requests, I will be forced to defend myself from your arbitrary 
moves as from criminal actions by all legal means, including 
extreme ones. At the same time, I warn you that it is you who 
will have to bear the responsibility for all consequences, as 
well as those who tolerate your self-will which I qualify as 
directed against the Lithuanian state and its interests rather 
than me. 
  To prevent such actions, I request that you immediately stop 
the proceedings and all persecutions linked with them, and 
return all my things confiscated during the illegal searches. 
  I am ready to give explanations in a legal manner, comment 
on 
documents, and explain the complicated procedure of acquiring 
arms not as a criminal but as former national defense minister 
of the Republic of Lithuania. 
  At the same time, I reserve the right to comment publicly on 
the actions of officials sent by you, who, in defiance of the 
law, also did everything to justify your arbitrary behavior 
under the cover of legal proceedings. 
  [Signed] Audrius Butkevicius, former Lithuanian national 
defense minister and signatory of the Declaration on the 
Restoration of Lithuania's Independence.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry press service 
reported that Karolos Papoulias, the foreign minister of Greece, 
which is the EU president for the current year, invited the 
Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov to visit Athens for a 
briefing on the situation in the [Azerbaijani] Republic. 
  In his letter to his Azerbaijani counterpart, Mr. Papoulias 
said: I hope that your visit to Athens will enable the EU to 
have a more profound understanding of problems related to 
Nagorno-Karabakh, and raise the ties between our countries to a 
new level of development. 
  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov met Belgian Vice 
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mr. Willy Claes, who was the 
EU president for 1993, in Brussels last December and had 
expressed his desire to address EU members on situation in 
Azerbaijan. Gasan Gasanov also noted that in view of the fact 
there is no satisfactory information about Azerbaijan in the 
West and most of the time the existing information is not 
objective, the EU should use all its possibilities productively 
to obtain first-hand information. This proposal of the 
Azerbaijani foreign minister was examined by the relevant EU 
organs and approved.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindj Abdullayeva and Viktor </F>
Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku March 28 TASS -- In an exclusive interview with 
ITAR-TASS, Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Hasan Hasanov 
described the characteristic features of his country's diplomacy 
at the present stage as pragmatism and an aspiration to 
establish partner- like relations with as many countries as 
possible. According to Hasanov, initially they plan to 
establish durable contacts with 60 countries. This is one-third 
of all the U.N. member states. 
  The head of the Azeri Foreign Affairs Department attributed 
special places in this list to contacts with the United States, 
Russia, Great Britain, France and China, the five permanent 
members of the U.N. Security Council and arbiters in world 
politics. According to Hasan Hasanov, stable working ties have 
currently been established with four of the countries, excluding 
the U.S., and documents regulating bilateral relations on a 
normative-legal basis have been signed. 
  The minister emphasised that "in relations with Russia, an 
end has been put to the policy of mutual reproaches and 
accusations". He said to that, thanks to measures adopted by the 
republic's new leadership, faults and instability in the 
relationship have been removed, old ties are being revived and 
new ones, especially trade and economic ones, are being 
established. 
  The second most important feature of the Azeri foreign 
policy, according to Hasan Hasanov, is the need to reassess his 
country's ties with the two neighbouring states of Turkey and 
Iran. 
  Although membership in the Commonwealth of Independent 
States 
(CIS) is approved in the republic, as relations with the CIS are 
relegated to third place Azerbaijan's foreign policy. 
  Membership in the CIS, which is considered here as one of 
the 
most authoritative interstate regional organizations, has helped 
the republic restore its ties with traditional economic 
partners, and has politically helped it ensure the protection of 
the republic's national interests.

  [Text] According to the press service of the 
Nagorno-Karabakh army, the Monday attempt of Azeri forces to 
break through Karabakh defenses on the eastern section of the 
front (Agdam region) proved a complete failure. 
  At dawn Azeri armored forces backed by combat planes and 
helicopters launched an offensive along the entire eastern 
frontline. 
  "Thanks to skillful and efficient actions by Karabakh forces 
all the Azeri attacks were countered by 9 a.m. the enemy 
suffered great losses, especially in combat vehicles", the press 
service reported. 
  A spokesman for the press service claimed over 10 armored 
vehicles were destroyed, among them six T-72 tanks and three 
armored infantry vehicles. Losses in personnel on the Azeri 
side exceed 150 persons. On the Karabakh side losses were 
minimal: one man was killed and 14 were wounded. In the 
afternoon the Azeri forces were thrown back to their initial 
positions. Hostilities in that section stopped. 
  Noteworthy changes were not reported from other sections on 
Monday.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry press service reported that 
Armenia's Armed Forces are continuing to shell the settlements 
in northwestern regions of Azerbaijan. The settlements in 
Tauzskiy Rayon has been coming under fierce rocket and artillery 
fire from Choratan military base in Berd region of Armenia since 
this morning. 
  Armenia's occupationist army launched an attack on Agdamskiy 
front on 27 March. The brave fighters of the Azerbaijani Army 
managed to halt the enemy's offensive and then launched a 
counterattack and liberated Shirvanly and Karakashly in 
Agdamskiy Rayon. At present, the battles are continuing in the 
direction of Geoytepe 10 km north of Agdam. One enemy tank and

260,000 of which were deported from Azerbaijan and the rest -- 
from Abkhazia and the Shaumyanski District of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  According to chief Vladimir Movsisyan of the national Agency 
on the Affairs of Refugees, the deportees enjoy all the civic 
rights and freedoms but no special status. They are regarded as 
people without citizenship. The 16,000 people deported in 1988 
from Sumgait, in Azerbaijan, have by now been provided with 
housing facilities or live in houses of their own. 28,000 
deportees enjoy the right to permanent residency in Armenia and 
another 35,000 have been given plots of land.

  [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze said that the 
situation in the Kodori canyon where fighting resumed last week 
between the Georgian and Abkhazian units has stabilized somewhat. 
  Speaking in parliament Tuesday, he said that women and 
children have been evacuated from the canyon. However, the 
majority of the population do not want to leave their homes. 
This is another indication that the population in the Kodori 
canyon needs help. 
  Shevardnadze also said that on Monday on the line of 
confrontation between the Georgian and Abkhazian forces near the 
Inguri River there were local clashes, but on Tuesday morning 
the situation was calm. 
  Shevardnadze noted the intensification of Russia's mediatory 
efforts and also talked about Georgia's preparedness for talks 
for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Georgian Defense Ministry 
said 
Tuesday that fierce fighting continues in the Kodori canyon near 
the village of Zemo Lata. Abkhazian units are shelling Georgian 
positions. About a dozen Abkhazian helicopters airlifted 
additional manpower and armaments from Sukhumi. 
  The spokesman said that in the early hours of March 29 there 
were no positional changes in the zone of fighting. As many as 
five Georgian were killed and four wounded. According to the 
spokesman, Abkhazian casualties totalled sixty. 
  Deputy chairman of the Tbilisi-based pro-Georgian Council of 
Ministers of Abkhazia, Akaky Gasviani, confirmed to Interfax 
that the advancement of the Abkhazian formations and 
maercenaries towards the Kodori canyon had been stopped by the 
morning of March 28. Now the line of confrontation passes near 
the village of Verkhnyaya Lata, he said. 
  Gasviani said that the chairman of the temporary committee 
for the state of emergency Djaba Ioseliani visited the Georgian 
positions Monday. 
  So far Interfax does not have an Abkhazian version of what 
happened in the Kodori canyon.

forcibly displaced last November and December made willful 
decisions to return to their homes, which ended tragically. 
  Abkhaz separatists killed, insulted, and robbed thousands of 
people. According to the recent information, certain people are 
still calling on the refugees from the Gali Rayon and other 
parts of Abkhazia to return to their homes in Abkhazia. 
  The provisional committee is making this authoritative 
statement urging people not to be guided by such provocations. 
The committee warns categorically all forcibly displaced 
persons to stop entering the territory occupied by the 
separatists until the government adopts a relevant resolution.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 29 Mar -- The eight-page draft Agreement on 
Achieving Civil Accord in Russia was handed over today for study 
by Boris Yeltsin. Work on completion of this document could 
take "a week or more," since the president attaches great 
importance to it in stabilizing society. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was told this by the president's press secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov. 
  After it has been worked on, the document will possibly 
become more compact. The president will evidently include his 
own observations, delete minor points, and send the draft for 
correction by a working group, the press secretary reported. He 
added that Boris Yeltsin "would not want the Agreement on 
Achieving Civil Accord to appear as an abbreviated version of 
the Constitution." 
  Vyacheslav Kostikov reported "the document will also undergo 
approval in political circles. In particular, Boris Yeltsin 
discussed the draft agreement today with Federal Council Speaker 
Vladimir Shumeyko." 
  We remind you that the text of this document, on the 
instructions of the head of state, has been worked on since 10 
March by a working group composed of representatives of the 
administration of the president, the government, parliamentary 
factions, political parties, and trades unions.

<F P=106> [Veronika Kutsyllo, Marat Salimov report: "President </F>
Returns to the Kremlin. Boris Yeltsin Focuses on Peace and 
Food"] 
  [Excerpt] Leaving Sochi on Sunday, the president singled 
out three objectives of primary importance that he is going to 
deal with right upon his return to Moscow -- the completion of 
the work on the mechanisms of implementing the presidential 
message to the parliament, the drafting of an agreement on civil 
peace, and the revision of new customs tariffs with a view to 
lowering them. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that a draft 
agreement, which had been drawn up by a group under Boris 
Topornin, director of the Institute of State and Law, was 
presented to Boris Yeltsin yesterday. Work on the mechanisms of 
implementing the presidential message is going on. As for food 
importers, they will apparently have to be patient. 
<H5>  Boris Yeltsin To Revise Civil Peace Agreement </H5>
  "Version No. 0" of the Agreement on Civil Peace and Accord, 
which had been drawn up by Boris Topornin's group (see 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 26 March), was seriously revised last 
weekend. According to unofficial reports, the text of the draft 
agreement (which, in the drafters' view, should not be made 
public before it is studied by the president) has been cut to 
nearly one-half of its original size: many declaratory 
provisions, already set forth in the Constitution and Russian 
laws, have been deleted. 
  There have been qualitative changes, too. The latest version 
of the "universal peace pact" as of yesterday no longer included 
the term "Third-Party Public Court," which, under initial plans, 
was to be made responsible for monitoring the implementation of 
the agreement and vested with the right publicly to demand that 
violators be removed from office or give up their deputy powers 
voluntarily. Now these functions have been given to the 
Conciliatory Commission, to be made up of representatives of the 
president, the government, State Duma factions, and political 
activists, and designed to work out mechanisms of the phased 
implementation of the agreement. 
  The working group has decided that a two-year moratorium on 
amending the Constitution should not be included in the draft 
and that it will be replaced with the proposal that "changes 
destabilizing the situation in society not be made to the 
Constitution." Provisions regarding the moratorium on changing 
the status of regions and concluding bilateral treaties between 
them and the federal authorities have been retained, as has the 
trade unions' obligation not to call strikes for the purpose of 
reallocating budget revenues. 
  It is hard to predict how much time Boris Yeltsin will need 
to comprehend the draft agreement and with which provisions of 
it he may disagree. At the same time, the question of the 
sequence of signing the agreement has not yet been resolved, and 
the Public Chamber's meeting to discuss it, initially scheduled 
for 2 April, will be postponed at least for a week, 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow March 29 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and speaker of the Federation Council had a meeting in 
the Kremlin on Tuesday. Current political, organisational and 
personnel problems have been discussed, Vyacheslav Kostikov, 
press secretary of the Russian president, told ITAR-TASS. 
Shumeyko informed the president about the activity of the 
Federation Council. Special attention was given to the work on 
the agreement "on the achievement of civil concord". Ways of 
its coordnation and signing were discussed. 
  During the discussion of economic aspects, Yeltsin expressed 
concern with possible negative consequences of the government's 
decision on customs duties, also for broad sections of the 
population. The president said he had discussed the matter with 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and they had arrived at a 
consensus about the need for adjustment on a number of important 
aspects, without discarding the principle of reasonable 
protectionalism regarding Russian manufacturers and dealers. 
  Yeltsin mentioned the possibility of holding meetings of the 
Russian Federation's Security Council with the participation of 
heads of chambers of the Federal Assembly. The president said 
this would widen a political base of decision-making on 
important problems having the bearing on security. 
  Ways of settling the Ossetian-Ingush conflict were also 
discussed during the meeting.

  According to Zhirinovskiy, the State Duma faction led by him 
"was the main instrument is getting adopted the political

part. He claimed that on its second day, the congress "will be

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Chugayev: "Boris Yeltsin Launches </F>
Presidential Election Campaign. Group of Favorites Well-Known. 
Appearance of `Dark Horse' Unlikely"] 
  [Text] In an interview that Boris Yeltsin gave IZVESTIYA 
late last week, the head of state confirmed his determination to 
hold national presidential elections in 1996. One can conclude 
from what he said that the Russian president only sees himself 
taking part in these elections as a voter. Thus, there is every 
reason to conclude that last Friday [25 March], B. Yeltsin 
effectively announced the start of a two-year presidential race. 
  At the same time other, albeit less important, events last 
week make it possible to speak of a new political situation that 
is developing in the country today and in which the election 
campaign will most likely be held, and also to talk about the 
most likely favorites. 
  These events include the continuing scandal over the 
anonymous coup d'etat scenario, A. Shokhin's appointment to 
oversee the economy [kurator ekonomiki], the developing squabble 
over the new customs duties on imported agricultural produce, 
and the State Duma's proposal to stage a vote of no-confidence 
in the government, 
  Analysis of all these and other events gives grounds for the 
following conclusion: The structurization of the main political 
forces is coming to an end in Russia. It is not the clash of 
individual political figures' personal interests and ambitions 
that is starting to have overwhelming importance in politics 
(although that does still happen), but the clash of group 
interests, and it is only as a result that conflicts arise 
between the politicians that voice these interests. 
  For instance, the Moscow mayor's continuing attacks on the 
government do not mean that Yu. Luzhkov personally cannot bear 
A. Zaveryukha. There has been an obvious clash of interests on 
the one hand between the agrarian lobby led by the vice premier 
and national commercial capital on the other led by the Moscow 
mayor. 
  Things are roughly the same regarding the scandal over the 
coup scenario. For some reason, observers who have discussed 
this subject have failed to notice a strange coincidence: The 
scandal precisely coincided not only with the president's 
vacation, but also with the end of the work to finalize the 
draft federal budget. Although you might recall that it was the 
president's refusal to sign the proinflationary budget law 
adopted by the former Supreme Soviet that preceded his decision 
to sign Edict 1400. As you know, the current draft federal 
budget severely infringes the interests of the 
military-industrial complex and a considerable proportion of the 
processing industry. Reports from informed sources indicate 
that serious conflicts have arisen over this between V. 
Chernomyrdin, who champions, as you know, the interests of the 
fuel and energy complex, and O. Soskovets and Yu. Skokov. 
Although in the past V. Chernomyrdin had put forward O. 
Soskovets for first vice prime minister. All these names 
feature among the coup scenario's top men. It is therefore 
logical to at least conclude that the appearance of the 
provocative pamphlets was highly opportune. 
  A. Shokhin's appointment late last week to head the economy, 
a post vacant following Ye. Gaydar's resignation, must obviously 
be regarded as the final round of the squabble. An effective 
counterbalance has been created in the person of the minister of 
the economy to the first vice premier who voices the interests 
of the industrial and military-industrial lobby, interests that 
are incompatible with those of the oil and gas lobby. 
  Presumably following the president's announcement opening 
the election campaign, the fighting over the budget will worsen 
still further since some of the money that has been channeled 
into economic sectors as a result will be used by rival groups 
to conduct the presidential campaign. 
  The impressive force of Russian banking capital did not stay 
aloof from political life last week either. The "12 December" 
parliamentary group, which voices the interests of some banking 
circles, declared B. Fedorov as its leader. Its former leaders 
-- A. Braginskiy and I. Khakamada -- have become the group's 
deputy leaders. Here, too, we can see that interests are being 
structurally formulated. 
  It is thus easy to conclude that a new stage of development 
is starting for Russian postcommunist society. Society is 
becoming increasingly structured. The lone politicians whose 
personal abilities recently enabled them to soar to the Russian 
political heights are becoming a thing of the past, giving way 
to figures backing the interests of departments, economic 
sectors, and, lastly, major social strata. In this respect it 
is no accident that we are seeing many political "stars" wane. 
It is not individuals, but political-economic groups that have 
joined the fight for power and are forming society's political 
infrastructure. 
  At the moment this struggle is not being conducted in an 
entirely civilized manner. Not by means of rivalry between 
parliamentary parties and the formation of a coalition 
government, but rather by lobbying, by putting pressure on top 
state officials. To make up for it the first positive factor in 
this new stage for Russia, where everything is always 
unpredictable, seems indisputable: The actions of leaders 
trying to influence the choice of the country's political and 
economic course are becoming predictable. Since the interests 
of the groups behind them are predictable. The time of 
political intriguers seems to be passing for Russia and the time 
of serious politicians is coming. And this in turn means that 
it is unlikely that a "dark horse" will appear among the group 
of favorites in the presidential race. 
  In effect, this very group of favorites can already be said 
to have formed today. The central figure there is undoubtedly 
V. Chernomyrdin, who is backed not only by the major Russian oil 
and gas companies which bring the country around 80 percent of 
its export revenue, but also the executive apparatus. Yu. 
Luzhkov, who has the backing of a considerable proportion of our 
national commercial and banking capital, has taken up position 
slightly to the right of the former. With B. Fedorov most 
likely on the very far right. 
  The situation on the opposite, left side of the starting 
line, where heavy industry, the military-industrial complex, and 
structures engaged in arms exports, are to set their 
participants, is more complex. The strongest candidate here is 
Yu. Skokov. However, he has little chance of reaching the 
finishing line first, primarily owing to his characteristic 
style as an "inaccessible" [zakrytyy] politician. The "Zemskiy 
Sobor" scenario that Deputy V. Isakov proposed in the past would 
be more promising for Yu. Skokov. But judging by B. Yeltsin's 
interview with IZVESITYA, that is ruled out. Thus, the 
"military-industrial complex team" will most likely have to 
choose between two politicians who have expressed a desire to 
defend its colors. Namely V. Zhirinovskiy and A. Rutskoy. The 
final choice will presumably fall on the person who most 
convincingly proves his loyalty to the team, as well as his 
manageability and predictability. 
  Amid this group of favorites V. Chernomyrdin looks the main 
contender for victory. If only because experience of all manner 
of elections and referendums held in Russia over the last two 
years shows that contests are won by the man who is able to rely 
on the state apparatus and has budget funds at his disposal. 
But two major factors will work against the premier. First, he 
will be constantly threatened with the possibility of the Duma's 
staging a vote of no-confidence in the government. The first 
proposal of this kind by I. Muravyev, member of the "New 
Regional Policy" faction, last week was just a trial shot. Such 
attempts should be expected to increase in the future 
particularly if the other participants in the contest agree 
among themselves to join forces in toppling their most dangerous 
rival. 
  But an even more serious factor that may effectively work 
against the prime minister will of course be the state of the 
Russian economy on the eve of the elections. One is bound to 
bear in mind the specific nature of Russian voters, who, as the 
results of the 12 December elections showed, vote "against" 
rather than "for." So if the economic situation has not 
improved by the time the elections are held, one should not rule 
out the idea that most voters will vote against V. Chernomyrdin 
and the existing regime and vote for A. Rutskoy or V. 
Zhirinovskiy, otherwise, they will vote against the threat of 
war and political instability.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Chelnokov: "Armed Opposition Abandons </F>
Underground"] 
  [Text] The political amnesty announced recently has 
essentially absolved the sins of the participants in the events 
of last fall. But those who built the barricades in central 
Moscow, fired shots from Kalashnikovs, and broke into the 
"Ostankino" television center have not been consigned to the 
archives together with the prosecutor's files. And probably far 
from all of them have acknowledged their guilt, still less come 
to terms with defeat. 
  Some "defenders of the Constitution" were released from 
prison, others emerged from underground where they had spent 
nearly six months hiding from the law enforcement organs. I 
wondered: Who are these people and what do they want now? 
  The amnesty has so emboldened some of them that they agreed 
to meet with the correspondent of the "ideologically alien" 
IZVESTIYA. 
  Colonel Aleksandr M. set as the main condition for our talk 
that his identity be kept anonymous. That, he gave me to 
understand over the telephone, was the directive "from above." 
Of himself he said only that he had graduated from the Lvov 
military-political school and taught at the Lenin 
military-political academy. He was coordinator of the "Officers 
Union" for the Moscow military district. He is easily 
recognized on a videotape made during last year's May Day 
demonstration by the opposition forces. In the White House he 
commanded a large subunit of "volunteers" who hid in a 
settlement near Moscow until recently. 
  They had prepared for my arrival. In the apartment where I 
was taken by a sturdily built boy called Gleb, several 
"defenders of the White House" were waiting and there was a pile 
of video cassettes on the table. "The official press is lying 
when it says we were the first to shoot at `Ostankino,'" a 
colonel dressed in camouflage with the merit badges of the 
airborne troops began the talk. 
  "Why did you go to take `Ostankino' at all?" I asked. "This 
was an action you knew to be futile: Even after purging the 
television center of `Vityaz' you would hardly have been able to 
broadcast." 
  "You cannot imagine the euphoria which possessed thousands 
of 
people at the time. For me it was the happiest moment of my 
life," one of the underground members replied. 
  The frames of the video report dispassionately recorded the 
prelude to the bloody tragedy. The deputies, emerging from the 
dark White House smelling of faeces (the lighting and sewerage 
system had been turned off for many days) called for history to 
be made. "Russia is with you!" they roared into the 
microphones. "Yeltsin's criminal regime is expiring. We shall 
see it into its grave!" And the crowd went to its slaughter. 
  The road was opened, a green light from Krasnopresnenskaya 
embankment to Ostankino. The armored personnel carriers 
followed a parallel course, with blue eyes smiling from under 
the tank drivers' hard hats and fingers making the "V" sign: 
"Vivat!" 
  Those taking part in the meeting demanded that "tele-vision" 
be brought to book and a truck rammed the door. People with 
assault rifles tried to repel the angry crowd from the building. 
A man in a camouflage jacket sat down not far from the 
entrance, with a grenade thrower ready. 

<H5>    Man with the Grenade Thrower </H5>
  I recognized this man. He miraculously survived that 
carnage. A grenade blast threw him onto a concrete flower tub. 
It may be considered that he got off lightly: He had bruising 
and a grenade fragment wound to his hand. I met with him when 
he had been discharged from hospital. 
  Radio engineer Nikolay Abramenkov remembers better than 
anyone the absurdity of the "Ostankino" forced march. And he 
even tried to persuade General Makashov of this but "obeying the 
oath" he had taken outside the White House he went to the 
television center as part of the "Sever" special group. Here 
they were already breaking the glass windows through which could 
be seen reflected the special militia members armed to the teeth 
and the fighters of the "Vityaz" special subunit. 
  And when the general, having set off for talks with the 
"other side," asked for "cover," Abramenkov unthinkingly picked 
up the grenade thrower. And it was not important that the 
30-year-old reserve officer did not know how to use the weapon 
-- "the main thing was to intimidate the special militia." He 
did not hear the radio conversations under way meanwhile among 
the "Vityaz" officers: "Do you see that grenade thrower? 
"Where, where?" "At the entrance. We must take him out." A 
single shot rang out and in a few minutes loops of tracer 
bullets were tearing through the crowd.... 
  In 1987 Abramenkov graduated from the Moscow 
radioelectronics 
institute. He worked at a mailbox [secret defense industry 
enterprise] and "rose" to the post of senior engineer. At the 
same time he matured in the social field: First he was a 
communist youth league organization secretary and then headed a 
party committee. In 1990, when "the project was closed because 
of conversion," he was obliged to engage in the production of 
"radio consumer goods" at a firm in the capital. 
  On 22 September, the day his son was born, he returned to 
Moscow from Smolensk. And learning of Yeltsin's edict no. 1400, 
he immediately went to the White House. He saw his son only a 
month later. "Why did I go there? To ensure they finally 
stopped selling the country. I saw plants standing idle in 
Smolensk while all around dealers were growing rich through 
speculation. It was time to put an end to the anarchy." 
  "But protesting against `anarchy' is one thing, taking an 
assault rifle and grenade thrower in your hand is quite another. 
Did you realize you would have to shoot people?" 
  "For the first two days I was on the barricades at the White 
House. Then I joined the `Sever' group. When virtually the 
entire guard left Rutskoy, we were asked to help him. We were 
issued weapons 30 September and the group was subordinate only 
to Rutskoy and General Makashov." 
  A special airborne forces officer to whom I showed the 
photograph of Abramenkov with the grenade thrower was taken 
aback: "We do not even use grenades of this type. We have the 
latest model." 
  "Where did you get the grenade thrower and ammunition?" 
  "It was taken from outside the city hall building. There was 
also a spray gun lying around there, which was picked up before 
the city hall was seized by Barkashov's supporters, who probably 
thought it was a weapon. And a man aged about 40 dressed in a 
militia uniform brought two grenades and handed them over. It 
looks as though it was all specially set up to provoke us but it 
was only later I guessed that. 
<H5>  Number After One, Two! </H5>
  The "Sever" group consisted of 12 men. Abramenkov would seem 
to be lying when he says that he joined it directly from the 
barricades. They took only tested people because, as became 
known from a reliable source, "Sever" was formed back in March 
1993 and not without the participation of "Nashi" member 
journalist Nevzorov. The group carried out the most dangerous 
tasks and that is why the losses were so great: Two members 
were killed and several seriously wounded. Some members had 
fought in the trouble spots of the former Union. 
  Those who came to the White House spontaneously and at the 
bidding of their hearts joined the "first Moscow volunteer 
regiment named for the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet." The 
regiment included a cossack battalion, two battalions of 
volunteer forces, and a subunit of the "Officers Union" -- in 
all about 1,000 men aged 18 to 60. 
  The gunmen of the Russian National Unity under the command 
of 
Barkashov himself were in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet 
armed forces under the fourth motorized rifle battalion. Like 
the first Moscow special cossack squadron and the 
above-mentioned "Sever" group, they were directly subordinate to 
the directives of "defense minister" by invitation Achalov. 
  Yesaul [cossack captain] Vladimir Kurochkin, the owner of 
the apartment in which my meeting with the underground defenders 
of the White House took place, was deputy ataman of a cossack 
squadron. This subunit numbered slightly over 100 men, mainly 
from Siberia, the Urals, and South Russia. 
  The passport of a USSR citizen was grounds for receiving an 
assault rifle. As was an application to the congress of 
people's deputies and Supreme Soviet asking to be considered a 
Russian patriot. Those who signed it swore an oath of loyalty 
to the "only legitimate" organs of power of the state and were 
considered servicemen. 
  In the long hours of deathly quiet the armed opposition 
marched along the asphalt paths and stood watch. It can be seen 
on the video recording how the opposition wallowed in the floods 
of misinformation coming from the White House balcony. The 
"defenders of the Constitution" did not know that the "reliable 
report" on the spontaneous transfer of yet another division to 
their side had been prepared by a few deputies "to strengthen 
their fighting morale." 
  The special militia members looking out of the armored 
personnel carriers were taunting them: "What's the matter with 
you, boys, we are with you." Barkashov's supporters were 
already whispering of storming the Kremlin. The airborne forces 
were meekly eating sandwiches made by women who were Communist 
Youth League members in the thirties. Engineers in camouflage 
were sticking ballpoint pens into the muzzles of the militia's 
assault rifles. Hurrah, our boys are coming, they shouted, 
seeing the approach of yet another convoy of armored vehicles 
which after a few hours would tear the crowd to shreds with 
large-caliber machineguns. 
  There was a set expression of perplexity on the faces of the 
dead: "How stupid, we were only a step from victory...." The 
survivors were cut down by salvos from the "stinking special 
militia who have betrayed Russia." 
  The rebels left the barricade not as a crowd but in 
detachments of insurgents who had sworn loyalty to a power which 
no longer existed. 
  Actually, I was told by Yesaul Kurochkin, they had not come 
to the White House to defend Khasbulatov or Rutskoy personally 
but rather to oppose "Yeltsin's criminal regime." 
<H5>  "Third Force" </H5>
  "What was it you so disliked about `Yeltsin's regime?'" I 
asked my interlocutors. "At least there are no wars in Russia, 
there is food in the stores, and no one is yet dying of hunger. 
And look what is being down on the outskirts of the former 
Union...." 
  "For a long time now the country has been controlled not by 
Yeltsin's clique," Colonel M. a former political worker, sought 
to enlighten me, "but by a third force. It is no accident that 
during his trip to Russia Nixon met with members of the 
opposition. The third force is now seeking someone on whom to 
gamble after the fall of the existing regime." 
  "Do you consider this `fall' to be inevitable?" 
  "Having issued his edict on the dissolution of parliament, 
Yeltsin put himself outside the law. And time is now working in 
our favor." 
  "But what about the political amnesty and the memorandum on 
accord?" 
  "The amnesty was issued for those accomplices of the 
criminal 
regime who are up to their elbows in blood. They were thus 
given the chance to go voluntarily. Otherwise civil war was 
inevitable. In my view the idea of concluding the memorandum on 
accord between the executioners and the victims is stillborn. 
The opposition will conclude it only after Yeltsin's voluntary 
resignation. All these Yeltsins, Kaufmans, and Rozenfelds who 
have found a cosy spot at the top taking cover under Russian 
surnames must go and the sooner the better for them." 
  The colonel's intentions are serious and as far as I know he 
is by no means alone in his thoughts and intentions. Somewhere 
deep underground a staff of armed forces named for the abolished 
Supreme Soviet is operating. Aleksandr M.'s deputies are almost 
constantly on the move "establishing contacts with fellow 
thinkers in the provinces." 
<H5>  Opposition's Weapon </H5>
  The losses of manpower during the October events were not as 
great as the opposition members are inclined to think. Colonel 
M., who had seven battalions under his command 3 October, for 
instance, could recall less than 10 men killed from his subunits. 
  But the opposition is losing its fighters in peace time. 
Last winter Russian National Unity activists Denisov and Kostin 
were arrested, as was "Sever" group commander Fridlender. 
  From Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs 
operational reports: 
  1. Aleksandr Kostin. Born 1961 in Voronezh Oblast. Was 
resident in Anninskiy Rayon, in Arkhangelskaya village, has 
previous convictions, is regarded a particularly dangerous 
recidivist. Arrested in Voronezh for mugging a taxi driver in 
Voronezh. 
  2. Aleksandr Denisov, from Buryat Autonomous Soviet 
Socialist Republic. Sentenced in Rostov-na-Donu in 1992 for the 
illegal possession of a weapon to corrective labor, from which 
he escaped. Has worked in militia organs in Estonia. Arrested 
in Tallinn in early 1994. 
  3. Sergey Fridlender, born 1967, from Lithuania. Was 
resident in Kobrin City, in Brest Oblast. Went to St. 
Petersburg in 1988. Since May 1992 has worked in the fifth 
detachment of the Russian Federation Finance Ministry 
paramilitary guard. Arrested 29 December 1993 in Kobrin on 
suspicion of the murder of two people. 
  According to available information the murders were 
committed 
with an assault rifle taken from the White House arsenal. In 
all the Supreme Soviet was assigned about 2,000 guns. To this 
day over 400 of them, mainly Kalashnikov assault rifles, have 
not been found. After Barkashov's supporters had seized the 
city hall building, 146 official-issue pistols and assault 
rifles were taken away. Only slightly more than 10 were 
returned. I am reliably informed that on the evening of 3 
October the more farsighted "White House defenders" used every 
available means to take away dozens of guns from the "last 
bastion of democracy." It is not hard to guess that these 
weapons of the opposition will be fired many times yet. 
  But my meeting with the underground members continued. On 
the video recording four boys are carrying the body of a young 
woman to somewhere to one side of the White House. She is 
stripped naked and her mane of dark hair is trailing on the 
ground. 
  Meanwhile Colonel M. told me: 
  "We broke out of the White House on the night of 4 October. 
Broke out is the word, because we could not surrender alive. 
There were about 200 of us and we left through the central 
exist onto Krasnopresnensakaya embankment and were about to move 
to the right, toward the international trade center, when 
suddenly we came under sniper fire. Then we moved rapidly 
toward the city hall. We broke through three cordons calmly, 
without a single shot. The special militia pretended not to 
notice us. We ran across some waste land, crossed a 
construction site, and then divided into groups of 10-15 and 
went in various directions. We walked through the city, dirty 
and unkempt -- it was immediately obvious where we had come from 
but no one tried to stop us. That stinking special militia 
seized those who had no weapons, not those that were needed. 
All those who had to got away.

  [Text] The judge of the Constitutional Court Valeriy Zorkin 
was surprised at media reports on Monday that he will possibly 
become a new member of the presidential council. In an 
interview with INTERFAX, Zorkin noted that so far he had not 
received such an offer and that it was too early to comment on 
such rumors. 
  At the same time, Zorkin said that the task of the new 
movement Accord for Russia (he was one of its initiators) is to 
unite various social and political forces. Zorkin stressed that 
the appeal of Accord for Russia to citizens should not be put in 
opposition to the agreement on civic peace in Russia prepared in 
the Kremlin. 
  According to Zorkin, he has not yet decided whether he will 
stay in the Constitutional Court, resign or get involved in 
politics, all the more so since the court's activities are still 
suspended and "it is ridiculous to pretend that it is working." 
  At the same time, such a situation to some extent can be 
justified, Zorkin believes. "If the Constitutional Court starts 
to work now, in the present unclear legal situation, it would 
find itself in a false situation," Zorkin said. There is only 
the new Constitution. The Duma has not in essence adopted a 
single law, there is no clear legal field. The Constitutional 
Court is the body oriented for an absolutely clear legal 
situation with a good-working mechanism of the division of 
powers and a legal basis." 
  Perhaps this is the reason why the authorities are not 
encouraging the Constitutional Court to start working 
immediately, Zorkin suggested.

  [Text] Now that the dust has settled around the furor over 
the "plot" against President Yeltsin, the question remains: Who 
should take responsibility for the whole thing? Aleksandr 
Zvyagintsev, chief of the Russian General Prosecutor's Office

PRAVDA that we will have to await the results of investigations 
being carried out by the Federal Counterintelligence Service, 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Prosecutor's Office. 
  Aleksandr Grigoryevich noted that the press has nothing to 
fear with regard to libel charges -- it has simply carried out 
its professional duty. Those who circulated these false stories 
prior to their publication in the press should bear the 
responsibility.

  [Text] The program for social and economic development 
worked out by the leadership of the Russian Communist Party and 
its faction in the State Duma should help Communists win the 
presidential and parliamentary elections. This was stated on 
Monday by a member of the State Duma Igor Bratishev at a Moscow 
conference in a document entitled "Russia's road to popular 
government and socialism". 
  Among other things the program suggests immediately freezing 
prices, stopping privatization and invalidating the 
privatization documents that "ignore the rights of workers and 
the public interest." 
  The former chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet Anatoliy 
Lukyanov said: "Presidency in general is alien to Russian and 
Soviet mentality." He is convinced that Russia needs "a strong 
representative body and a strong government subordinate and 
accountable to this body." 
  A former top-ranking official in the Soviet Communist Party 
Yegor Ligachev announced that preparations have begun for the 
second congress of peoples of the USSR due in September-October. 
The first congress was held in Moscow on 20 September l993.

<F P=106> [Article by Presidential Council Member Leonid Smirnyagin: </F>
"The Time Set Aside For Sorting Out Relations Between the 
Authorities Has Been Completely Exhausted"] 
  [Text] Any assessment of the elections to local organs of 
power must be more than depressing. The extremely low voter 
turnout and the greatly reduced quality of the candidates 
demonstrate major shifts in the Russian electorate. A number of 
the previous local authorities were wallowing in corruption, and 
voters are only too well aware of the fact. Many of the new 
candidates are merely running for office in order to get rich. 
  Moreover, the speed of the economic reforms and the desire 
to 
do everything at one fell swoop, which may be borne out by 
history some day, has occasioned extremely profound 
disappointment among voters at these elections with regard to 
the present forms of Russian statehood and the institution of 
democracy as a whole. 
  I think it very dangerous that the federal authorities do 
not 
realize the significance of these processes. They have not only 
failed to pay the slightest attention to the local elections, to 
say nothing of applying any sort of pressure, they have not even 
bothered to show the most basic interest in this process. 
  I am afraid that against this background the struggle over 
the Memorandum of Civil Accord will appear to voters as merely a 
deal stuck between politicians in Moscow. The Memorandum of 
Accord should be presented as an appeal to the people by power 
structures and social organizations, letting them know that a 
new stage has been reached in the establishment of Russian 
statehood: "We have finished the power struggle, we have 
stopped pushing each other off our chairs. The Constitution has 
been adopted, and constitutional work lies ahead of us. If 
possible we will do everything in our power to correct mistakes. 
Our work aims to drastically change the nature of state power." 
  The fact that the authorities have been preoccupied with 
themselves is justified and necessary up to a point: After all, 
we have been building a new kind of statehood and setting up new 
institutions. And time has been needed to establish these 
mutual relationships. However, the time set aside for this 
purpose has been somewhat protracted. Moreover it has been 
completely exhausted. There is no longer any need to address 
this issue. We now have a Constitution, and all parties are 
united in the opinion that consensus can and must only be 
reached within the framework of the current Basic Law. 
  Thus we already have a basis for consensus in the form of 
the 
Constitution, and it is time to get down to specific tasks 
rather than the infighting between various authorities. 
  We need consensus not just for its own sake, as a sort of 
agreement contest, but in order to open a path toward creative 
work, to correct the mistakes of the past and move ahead.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yermolin: "Chemical Weapons Must Be </F>
Destroyed... But It Is an Expensive Business"] 
  [Text] The parliamentary hearings in the State Duma 
Thursday [24 March] showed how complex the situation is in 
connection with Russia's international commitments in the sphere 
of the destruction of chemical weapons (CW). Defense Ministry 
spokesman Major General Yuriy Tarasevich stressed that the 
military department expects the deputies to provide legislative 
support in such a difficult and expensive business as the 
destruction of chemical weapons. According to the military, the 
blueprint for CW destruction needs to be legislatively 
formalized. A draft blueprint will be presented to the State 
Duma in mid-April. We also need laws on CW destruction and on 
the social protection of the population in areas where these 
weapons are being destroyed. 
  Funding for all measures connected with preparations for the 
actual recovery of toxic substances and munitions is extremely 
uneven and inadequate. Getting rid of Russian chemical weapons 
will cost two trillion rubles [R] in 1993 prices. Meanwhile, 
some R10.4 billion are supposed to be allocated for this purpose 
in the current year. But we all know full well how funds are 
being allocated this year. The CW disarmament program is no 
exception. 
  There was a note of anxiety in what Maj. Gen. Yuriy 
Tarasevich said. A number of arsenals established back in the 
fifties in Udmurtia and Saratov Oblast are in need of a complete 
overhaul. In existing conditions, such an overhaul is a very 
difficult and dangerous business. One would like this to be not 
an exlusively military headache. Let us hope the hearings go 
some way toward this. 
  The military-political aspects of Russia's joining the 
Convention on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons were also 
examined during the hearings. The inevitable question arose: 
Might it not happen that our country will abandon this type of 
weapon, while other countries, including those bordering on 
Russia, will remain "chemically" armed and, moreover, will reach 
a new level as a result of scientific developments? In general 
terms, the Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry spokesmen 
assured those present that in this case there are reliable 
control mechanisms in place and the world community provides 
certain guarantees. But the detailed reply to this question 
obviously had to wait until the hearings resumed behind closed 
doors. 
  We would point out that the Convention on Chemical Weapons 
was signed in Paris in 1993. So far it has been signed by 156 
states, but it has been ratified by only four: Sweden, 
Mauritius, the Seychelles, and Fiji. Whether Russia is to 
become the fifth depends on how convincing the Foreign and 
Defense Ministries' proratification arguments are in the eyes of 
the parliamentarians. All I would say is that, in the event of 
ratification, we will be able to count on financial assistance 
from Western countries and the United States.

"When Missiles `Die'"] 
  [Text] Support centers for implementing arms reduction 
treaties exist in every branch of the Armed Forces but a special 
place is occupied by the Strategic Missile Forces' center, given 
the political realities that exist in the world. So when it 
became necessary to create such centers in Belorusia [Belarus] 
and the Ukraine [na Ukraine], it was no wonder that they turned 
to the missile troops in particular for their experience, and 
there is no denying that such experience exists there. 
  Suffice it to recall that since the founding of the support 
center -- this dates back to the time of the implementation of 
the Treaty on Intermediate-and Shorter-Range Missiles -- 826 
deployed and nondeployed intermediate-range RSD-10, R-12, and 
R-14 missiles, 608 launchers for those missiles, 60 missile 
operational bases, and dozens of auxiliary installations have 
been scrapped under the organizational control of the Strategic 
Missiles Forces High Command and officers from the center and 
with their direct participation.... 
  The forthcoming work involved in the reduction of strategic 
offensive arms is even larger in scale. The intensity of the 
center's activity is now determined by the fact that missile men 
began the planned destruction of obsolete missile complexes last 
year without even waiting for the ratification of START-I and 
START-II. 
  More than 200 silo-based missile launchers were removed from 
service and then destroyed. A lot of work, notably by the 
center's specialists, went into the creation of the Russian 
destruction bases in Surovatikha and Pibanshurye and the 
preparation of sites for the reception and stationing of U.S. 
inspection groups at Strategic Missile Forces installations.... 
  Colonel General Aleksandr Petrovich Volkov, first deputy 
commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, who heads 
the entire destruction project, believes that "the missile 
troops are absolutely ready to ensure the successful fulfillment 
of all the commitments made under the treaty." 
  Who are they, these people who bear the burden of the 
destruction program on their shoulders? Colonel Anatoliy 
Murashenkov, the center's chief, now takes up the story: 
  "Officers of the Support Centers for Implementing Arms 
Reduction Treaties are real missile men. They only employ 
people who have a wealth of military experience, who know 
missile work and technology inside out, and who have years of 
alert duty behind them." 
  Col. Murashchenkov himself, incidentally, was chief of a 
combined unit's operational department prior to his appointment 
to the Support Center (it was called the Center for Destruction 
Management [Tsentr upravleniya likvidatsiyey] then). Prior to 
that he had a learned all there is to know about missile service 
from many posts. Like all the other officers he learned the 
science of weapon destruction "from scratch" and by practical 
experience. No one in the missile forces at that time knew as 
much as he did. 
  I met with other specialists at the center. Colonel Valentin 
Romashev, Colonel Georgiy Khristoforidi, Lieutenant Colonel 
Anatoliy Pavlov, Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Shpirko, Lieutenant 
Colonel Viktor Yakunin.... They, like other officers, have 
clearly defined duties. Some are responsible for the planning 
and coordination of destruction work and monitoring the 
fulfillment of treaty obligations, others are busy with the 
arms-destruction related problems of the military economy 
[voyskovoye khozyaystvo] and the use of the funds thus 
released.... 
  Much time is spent on preparing and providing support for 
the inspection work. During the center's six years' existence 
316 inspection groups have visited the Missile Forces alone. 
They monitor progress in implementing the Treaty on 
Intermediate- and Shorter-Range Missiles (reciprocal inspection 
activity under the treaty will not end until the next century) 
and of conventional arms agreements.... 
  "After the completion of special courses," Colonel Vladislav 
Alekseyev says, "the center's officers themselves work in 
inspection groups in the United States, Belgium, Britain, 
Germany, and Italy." 
  Vladislav Arseniyevich, for example, has twice done 
inspection work at the Hercules plants in Salt Lake City. 
  I did not catch the demolition engineers at home that day. 
Colonel Vasiliy Orzhekhovskiy and Colonel Mikhail Kiryushin 
together with their subordinates were busy organizing and 
providing backup for the unique job of destroying silo 
missile-launchers, which KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already written 
about and which people have been able to see for themselves in a 
recent Radar TV movie for Ostankino Television. 
  But the duty shift was there that day, as it was supposed to 
be. Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Kirshkovskiy and Major Andrey 
Titov were busy with current operational work, maintaining 
communications with the National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center 
and receiving information from the CSCE.... 
  The work at the center seemed to me to be routine and free 
of 
fuss. Even when the latest notification of an inspection from 
the United States arrived I did not see any change in the pace 
of work. They did not know which Strategic Missile Forces 
installation would be inspected or on what scale the inspection 
would be (there is a memorandum stipulating this), but the 
officers knew well what they had to do in these circumstances. 
Just as they do in all other situations connected with the 
destruction of nuclear missiles, furthermore.

  [Text] According to information received by RIA from the 
Russian State Committee for Defense Industry, the number of 
privatized enterprises in the defense sector in 1993 increased 
by over three times and amounted to 642 enterprises. 
  In July, the State Committee for Defense Industry is going 
over to a qualitatively new stage of privatization -- investment 
auctions. Their aim is to attract funds from this country and 
foreign investors for technological renovation of the plant 
undergoing conversion.

<F P=106> ["Interlocutor of the Day" interview with Russian State Duma </F>
Chairman Ivan Rybkin by Vladimir Yermolin; place, date not 
given: "Russia Remains a Power. And a Great Many More Will 
Cling to Its Shoulder" -- first paragraph is boxed "Calling 
Card" introduction] 
  [Text] Ivan Petrovich Rybkin was born in 1946. He 
graduated from the Volgograd Agricultural Institute, the CPSU 
Central Committee Academy of Social Sciences, and the Foreign 
Ministry Diplomatic Academy; he is a candidate of technical 
sciences and senior lecturer, worked in industry, and spent 17 
years lecturing in a higher educational establishment. Until 
his election as a Russian people's deputy in 1991, he was second 
secretary of the Volgograd CPSU Oblast Committee. In the 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet he was coordinator of the 
"Communists of Russia" faction. He was elected to the State Duma 
in December 1993. He has been chairman of the State Duma since 
January 1994. 
  [Yermolin] Ivan Petrovich, let us begin with our traditional 
questions: What is your attitude toward military service? What 
was your military rank? 
  [Rybkin] My current military rank is major in the reserve. 
I did compulsory service in my time. After graduating from the 
school for junior aviation specialists I served in the Air Force 
near Tula -- the regiment was called "Normandy-Neman" in the old 
style. So far as I know, all the men in our family served in 
the Army. My great grandfathers received land on the right bank 
of the Khoper for 25 years of irreproachable service. One of my 
great grandfathers fought at Shipka, and the other fought in the 
Russian-Japanese war and World War I. My father is a Great 
Patriotic War invalid. He came home badly wounded and severely 
shell-shocked, mute and deaf. My mom married him when he was in 
that state.... My uncle, a colonel in the reserve, has five 
combat decorations. My two cousins are officers and both serve 
in the North. In a nutshell, I regard military service as a 
sacred duty. 
  [Yermolin] Such an attitude toward service and the Armed 
Forces can scarcely be described as commonplace today. There 
are many reasons for this. But I think you will agree that 
legislators too must have their say here and work to increase 
the Army's prestige. 
  [Rybkin] You are quite right. The Army must be thoroughly 
helped today. The serviceman still does not enjoy full legal 
protection today. 
  At this point I can say the following: The State Duma 
Defense Committee and the Russian Federation Defense Ministry 
must have joint working groups which, among others, would 
resolve the task of monitoring the way in which the laws that 
are adopted are implemented. In other words, monitoring the 
entire sequence: the law, the procedure for application, and 
implementation at local level. Our committee is vested with 
monitoring functions, and I know its members intend to strictly 
oversee the implementation of laws from the "military package." 
As for the package itself, we are not going to start over from 
scratch. Some things will be revised and added to. We will 
also reinstate a great deal that had been lost. For instance, 
providing retirees with land. Remember the norms of the postwar 
period: When, say, a colonel who had fought bravely was 
discharged, his chest covered in decorations, the state would 
give him a house and one hectare of land. This also 
demonstrated the state's attitude toward the military, its 
defenders. Today former officers could also do a great deal to 
develop private farming. The most effective assistance will be 
given to them here. It has to be said that nowadays those who 
are discharged from the Army into the reserve or who retire are 
much less well protected than formerly. If only because these 
processes used to be planned, whereas now mass discharges are 
taking place as a result of the reform while people at local 
level are often simply unable to handle all the retirees. In 
principle, I will say one thing: So far as we are concerned, 
the Army and legal support for it are a priority sphere of 
activity. And in the very near future we hope to begin 
examining draft laws from the "military package." But I will 
note that I would like to see a prompter response from the 
Defense Ministry to our request to provide help in the form of 
skilled advisers and to assign experienced specialists to work 
on the committee. There are professional soldiers on the 
committee, but assistance would be nice. I also want to 
emphasize that, despite the fact that the Defense Committee 
represents literally all factions, there are no disagreements 
over approaches toward solving the Army's problems: Everyone is 
unanimous that the Armed Forces need a reliable legal base today. 
  [Yermolin] There is also another problem that perturbs the 
military today -- the protection of the defense budget. It is 
no secret that even the funds assigned for defense purposes 
according to the budget often have to be wrestled out of the 
Finance Ministry, so to speak. 
  [Rybkin] I can only repeat -- here too the State Duma will 
monitor things most strictly. Unfortunately, we are still not 
able to live according to a single state budget. So now we are 
having to ratify the budget quarterly. The government recently 
sent us the draft budget law for the second quarter: to 
authorize funding in the amounts for the first quarter. The 
State Duma already adopted it by 23 March. I would emphasize 
that the Army must receive everything allocated to it under the 
law. We will keep a constant eye on this, and we will react 
promptly and harshly to any attempts to hurt the military in any 
respect. 
  [Yermolin] Problems of funding and social protection are 
certainly keenly felt as far as the Army is concerned. But the 
military react just as sensitively to political instability in 
the country. It has long been noted that, as a rule, it is 
purely civilian people who speak lightly of war. The 
professional soldier, more than anyone, knows the price of peace 
and is interested in civil accord. Today we can see how various 
forces in society -- the president, the government, parliament, 
and movements and parties -- are attempting to arrive at general 
accord. Admittedly, it is somewhat worrying that some people are 
attempting to use even peace initiatives, memorandums, and 
statements for purposes of political confrontation. In this 
connection my question is this: How do you, as chairman of the 
State Duma, envision the road to civil accord? 
  [Rybkin] First of all, I think that in October we all 
received a real inoculation against any relapse into the 
sickness of "civil war." The extremists gained the upper hand 
then, and we all suffered a defeat. We must learn from this. I 
have always said and I reiterate today: We are all doomed to 
reach accord. Doomed. I have seen for myself that the president 
is today particularly persistent on the road toward accord. We 
have mutual understanding and cooperation with his structures 
and with Boris Nikolayevich himself. I do not feel any 
particular concern that some people are putting forward their 
own peace initiatives. Here, as the poet said, "let fame be the 
spur." I see no contradictions on this path. The president 
voiced his proposals in his message. Then Boris Nikolayevich 
assembled a conference and two cochairmen of a working 
commission were appointed. The commission is now working on a 
document that will reflect the desire of all Russia's branches 
of power, parties, social organizations, trade unions, and 
religious groups for civil peace. The Duma has delegated 
Alevtina Vasilyevna Fedulova to the commission, and 
representatives of different factions and deputies' groups are 
also taking part. That is, normal cooperation is under way. I 
do not know where this talk of a "war of peace initiatives" 
originates. Like the rumors of conspiracies and confrontation 
in general. The president will return to Moscow, and everyone 
will get together and I am sure will sign a memorandum or pact 
of civil peace. You can call it what you will, but the 
important thing is that they will sign a common accord not to 
violate but to strengthen peace in society. In fact the 
recently announced amnesty was the first step toward this. I am 
sure that the majority of Russian citizens welcome the fact that 
we have had sufficient sense and sufficient heart to forget the 
black days of enmity. It could not be otherwise. People can 
breathe freely, and hopes for a better future have emerged. 
There is no need to keep a worried eye on the political 
pendulum to see which way it is going to swing and who is going 
to arrest and put on trial whom tomorrow. All the people who 
have been released have been given an opportunity to embark on 
creative activity. If some do not take this opportunity and 
again attempt to stage a political brawl, we, together with the 
president, are able to give them an appropriate warning or put 
them back behind bars, this time under tougher articles of the 
Criminal Code. I would remind you that amendments of this sort 
to the Criminal Code have already passed their first reading in 
the Duma. It is precisely the amnesty that in many respects 
made possible the appearance of the document on all-Russian 
accord that is now in preparation. 
  [Yermolin] Politics is capable of bringing about such an 
accord, but only the economy can preserve and consolidate it. 
Do you agree with that view, Ivan Petrovich? 
  [Rybkin] Of course. This is why we are working so hard in 
the Duma on a code of laws capable not only of ensuring the 
progress of the economic reforms but in some respects of 
anticipating them. Our main problem is the decline in 
production. Until producers begin to work, you can write the 
most beautiful budgets in ornamental Slavonic script but nothing 
will change for the better. We have a state sector in the 
economy -- we must restore its full controllability. 
Controllability not so much by administrative methods as by 
economic methods. As for the private sector, it should be borne 
in mind that in all countries it is regulated by means of taxes, 
the system of benefits, and so on. And the private sector must 
work in the interests of the state. This is entirely natural. 
Unfortunately, legislators are at present lagging behind the 
processes that are taking place in society, in the sphere of 
economic relations. But, I repeat, a package of draft laws 
forming the legal framework for economic reform is largely ready 
in the Duma committees, and work on the draft laws at plenary 
sessions will begin in the next few days. 
  [Yermolin] Returning to the topic of civil peace, I would 
like to know: How explosive do you think the very fact of such 
sharp stratification of society into poor and rich may prove to 
be? After all, today over one-third of Russians are below the 
poverty line. 
  [Rybkin] The state is obliged to support and will support 
those who, for objective reasons, have been left helpless in 
market conditions -- elderly people, invalids, large families, 
orphans.... But it is impossible to turn Russia back into one 
big social security department. Yes, the state must protect its 
citizens' rights -- the right to work and to remuneration. Work 
and provide for yourself and your family by your labor. You can 
put your trust in the state today, but you must rely primarily 
on yourself. As for "budget-financed workers," including the 
military, as I have already said, the State Duma insofar as its 
rights permit will act as the guarantor that the state does not 
renege on its commitments here. 
  [Yermolin] Do you think that the social base exists for 
civil accord in the country? 
  [Rybkin]) I am sure that the overwhelming majority of 
Russians realize that today you cannot have everything all at 
once and today you cannot think in terms of "Whites and Reds." 
People also realize this. Where does this clear division exist 
in real life? Nowhere. Everything is interwoven. My 
grandfather got on his horse and went to fight against Yegor 
Gaydar's grandfather. Brother went to war against brother. Do 
we want all this to happen all over again? I am sure that if in 
1921 Soviet power had not declared an amnesty on everyone who 
fought against the "Reds" in the civil war, it would have been a 
long time before there was peace on the Don and in southern 
Russia. Only after "amnesia" had been declared did real civil 
peace and a transition to creative life become possible. In 
1921 my grandfather got off his horse and hung up his saber. I 
remembered this when I supported the idea of an amnesty for all 
participants in political clashes. Understanding by Russian 
citizens that civil war is the ruin of Russia is the basis that 
will unite everyone. 
  [Yermolin] In addition to that understanding, I would like 
to hope that Russians also have a sense of being a power, one 
power for all. A power that has its own interests and dignity. 
  [Rybkin] Unfortunately, we have rather forgotten our own 
interests in recent years. Take the problem of credits. In 
1992 we paid off more credits than the United States. Why? At 
a time when we ourselves need credits. We must put an end to 
this. Relations with foreign countries, including nearby ones, 
must be based on the proverb: "Prudence will not spoil a 
friendship." Especially with regard to warning countries. 
Anyone who picks up a weapon must be aware that his is 
primarily ruining his own country and his own family. 
  [Yermolin] The example of the peacemaking mission in 
Yugoslavia indicates that we still remember our geopolitical 
interests. 
  [Rybkin] That is true. Our actions here must be very 
considered. Not everybody likes the inclusion of Russia in the 
European security system. Remember merely the fact that we are 
still being kept in the "antechamber" to the Council of Europe 
whereas the Baltic countries got through it quite quickly. We 
should not be in a hurry and fuss about. Incidentally, this 
also applies to the "Partnership for Peace" program. Russia is 
not an ordinary participant in the international process. 
Accordingly the terms of the proposed partnership must take 
this into account. Incidentally, U.S. Defense Secretary William 
Perry, who recently visited our country, agreed with me on this 
point. If along with the withdrawal of troops from Germany and 
the Baltic states, we also join in a process of standardization 
[unifikatsiya] "after the pattern of so and so," there will be 
more than enough negative consequences. Negative so far as 
Russia's defense capability is concerned. As for partnership, 
this can only be welcomed. Especially as partnership in this 
instance is mutually advantageous. Russia has been and remains 
one of the crucial factors in world security. Whether some 
people like this or not. 
  [Yermolin] Ivan Petrovich, finally let me ask you a few 
short questions. What is your view of Mikhail Poltoranin's 
statement about the prospect of extending the powers of the 
Federal Assembly until 1998? 
  [Rybkin] From a purely legal viewpoint this is possible. By 
kind agreement with the president and the Federation Council. 
But the main say here belongs to the people. Even without a 
referendum it will be clear whether our activity suits Russian 
citizens or not. Then we will decide. At the moment we are 
laying the foundations for full-blooded work by the sixth State 
Duma. Not a sitting goes by without our adopting one or two 
laws. So much for the question of the effectiveness of the 
Duma. We are close to working in a more coordinated fashion. 
  [Yermolin] How do you understand the expression "The Army is 
outside politics"? 
  [Rybkin] It is desirable for the Army to be outside 
politics, but to know what is happening in politics. Don't 
forget that enlightenment has always been a strong point of the 
Russian Army. Having a clear idea of the world in which you 
live, and knowing the line that cannot be crossed. Russian 
officers were world-renowned for being marked by education, 
culture, and a lofty understanding of duty, dignity, and honor, 
and the Russian intelligentsia used to devote the best years of 
its youth to service. And this was correct. 
  [Yermolin] Do you take an optimistic view of the future? 
  [Rybkin] I can answer that question as follows. U.S. Vice 
President Gorn [as published] said to me: "I want to share your 
confidence in the success of the reforms if only because Russia 
is a country of highly educated people, more educated even than 
in the United States." Admittedly, he added that we lack 
pragmatism. Yes, I am confident that Russia has been and will 
remain a respected country in the world and a power. And many 
will cling to the shoulder of this power in search of protection 
and support.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation State Duma Defense Committee, under the "Politics" 
rubric: "`Partnership for Peace' Is Part of an Overall Security 
System"] 
  [Text] The "Partnership for Peace" program basically 
proclaims acceptable objectives and tasks to which Russia can 
and should append its signature. However, there are several 
objections with regard both to the accession procedure and the 
contents of the actual program. The acceptance procedure (the 
"16+1" formula) virtually deprives CIS countries of the right to 
collective security. The 16 NATO countries decide whether a 
particular country can participate in the program and basically 
set the terms for participation. My second observation regards 
the content of the program. First of all it envisages 
standardization of the communications and then the weapons of 
countries taking part in the program. This will naturally deal 
a very serious blow to the interests of our military-industrial 
complex. These two points are the most serious, and 
representatives from the Ministry of Defense, the Foreign 
Ministry, and the Security Council have not yet provided answers 
to these objections. It is true that, in addition to a market 
agreement, a number of presentation programs have been 
envisaged, and it is these programs which will in fact designate 
the degree to which a particular state will participate in 
signing up to the "partnership," and hence the costs to be borne 
by that state in implementing the program. There are other 
objections connected with Russia's status as a nuclear state 
with a powerful military-industrial potential. Consequently 
Russia is simply signing up to a program which has been 
formulated without its participation, and this is somewhat 
damaging to its prestige. Moreover, the program itself is a 
veiled way of expanding NATO. All these issues need to be looked 
at as a whole, and therefore we have reached two conclusions at 
our parliamentary hearings. The first is this: If Russia joins 
the "partnership," it should put forward a number of conditions 
with a view to alleviating any negative consequences. The 
second conclusion is that the "Partnership for Peace" program 
should be regarded merely as part of the establishment of a much 
more overarching security system linked to new realities 
following the end of the Cold War.

  [Excerpt] Elections to bodies of representative power and 
local self-government will take place in 29 regions of Russia 
today, ITAR-TASS reports. The elections will take place, in 
particular, in Krasnoyarsk and Stavropol krays, in Kurgan, 
Bryansk, Vladimir, Voronezh, Rostov, Ryazan, and Samara oblasts. 
  The local authorities in Maritime Kray and Ulyanovsk Oblast 
have decided to postpone the elections there, although the 
Central Electoral Commission scheduled them for 27 March. 
However, ITAR-TASS reports that the failure to keep to the 
schedule does not violate the law. 
  In the Russian Federation, 40 components have already held 
elections to bodies of representative power, and observers 
report that the turnout was low. 
  It seems that a similar picture is being painted today. Our 
correspondent Tamarova Ventsimerova reports on how the elections 
are proceeding in Novosibirsk Oblast. 
  As sociologists thought, by morning the turnout by the 
Novosibirsk electorate was low. According to data from the 
oblast electoral committee, by 1000 local time, just 3.38 
percent of the oblast's electorate had voted. According to the 
city electoral commission, just over 2 percent of the city's 
electorate had voted by that time. 
  There are 202 candidates who have registered for the oblast 
soviet; 49 of them are to be elected. For the city soviet, 103 
candidates have registered; 25 of them will be elected. 
  Our correspondent thinks confusion over the time change 
might 
be one of the many reasons for citizens' lack of interest in the 
elections. Summertime was introduced in Russia at 0200 this 
morning. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chief Sergey Yudakov of the regional 
Administration's department on work with the bodies of municipal 
power told INTERFAX Sunday that in spite of the low voter 
turnout, municipal elections in the Moscow region would possibly 
be regarded as valid. According to Yudakov, 18 percent of the 
voters had come to cast ballots by 1500. By 2200, which is the 
polling stations' closing time, another 7 percent or more would 
have taken part in the elections. 
  Under the existing regulations, at least 25 percent of the 
voters must come to the polling stations if elections are to be 
regarded as valid. 
  On 27 March the Moscow and 30 other regions of the Russian 
Federation are holding municipal elections. Voter turnout is 
low everywhere. The central electoral commissions of the 
Kaliningrad and Kaluga regions say that slightly more than 21 
percent of the voters cast ballots by 1500.

  [Text] The elections to the People's Assembly in the 
Karachai-Circassian Republic [Karachayevo-Cherkess AO] and a 
referendum on the presidency scheduled for 24 April have been 
postponed until a new constitution is adopted. The decision was 
taken at the emergency parliament session which closed on 
Saturday night. The session transformed the parliament into a 
people's assembly. 
  Before the decision was taken, the parliament regulations 
were changed because deputies of the Russian nationality left 
the session. The session also formed the legislative committee 
of the Republic's People's Assembly, which consists of 27 
deputies representing the main nationalities of the republic. 
Elected to it were five deputies from each of the Abazin, 
Nogai, Karachai and Circassian nationalities and one deputy from 
each of Ossetian and Greek nationalities. It is decided to 
elect to the legislative committee five deputies of the Russian 
nationality at the next stage of the session scheduled for 1 
April. 
  The decisions of the emergency session have caused a very 
negative reaction among the public movements and parties of 
Karachai-Circassian Republic which stand for the holding of 
democratic elections on 24 April.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 28 Mar, TASS -- "Legislative and Executive 
Branches of power in the subjects of the federation are being 
balanced off," according to Sergey Samoylov, acting head of the 
Department for Work with Regions in the President Boris 
Yeltsin's administration. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Samoylov said that 
the election campaign has entered its final stage in Russian 
regions. Between December 1993 and last Sunday elections were 
held in 69 regions. In 59 of them they were considered good and 
valid. Their legislative bodies are formed by two-thirds and 
can begin operation. 
  Despite gloomy forecasts, elections this past weekend showed 
that "the activity of the electorate on the whole increased and 
reached about 40 per cent on the average," Samoylov said. They 
were held in 27 regions because North Ossetia, the Maritime 
region and two other regions have postponed them until a later 
date. Elections were good in 24 regions and failed, according 
to preliminary reports, in the Samara, Magadan and Ryazan 
regions. In some regions, local bodies of power are 100 per 
cent staffed. For example, in the Irkutsk region, in all 45 
constituencies more than 40 per cent of voters cast their 
ballots. 
  The failure was also reported in the cities of Voronezh, 
Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk and Samara. 
  Samoylov pointed to the "unpleasant tendency" when former 
heads of regional soviets can regain power, for example in the 
Kemerovo, Kurgan and other Russian regions. The winners include 
many heads of regional administrations, directors of industrial 
enterprises. The party elite, both right and left, kept low 
profile. 
  Explaining the increase in the activity at the final stage, 
Samoylov noted that the administrations which held these 
elections had drawn on the experience of their neighbours. They 
had more time to prepare for the elections, explain their idea 
to the population and engage the local mass media. However the 
situation was also affected by the lingering "syndrome of 
elections to the State Duma," Samoylov explained. People see 
that it has not adopted a single law yet. This makes them draw 
parallels with their local councils. "The Zhirinovskiy 
phenomenon is also scary," he added. 
  The voting proceeded more actively in rural areas. Experts 
are tending to explain it by the more tight discipline in rural 
communities and their greater dependence on local bodies of 
power. 
  Ten regions will hold by-elections, but "we already have 59 
formed bodies of power," Samoylov said. This is very important 
because "the Executive Branch should not be left alone for too 
long," he added. He believes that confrontation between 
branches of power may be expected only in a small number of 
regions. 
  In more than 10 regions local councils have already begun 
their operation. In some regions elections will be held with 
consent of the Central Electoral Commission by June, in others 
this coming autumn. 
  Samoylov stressed that federal bodies of power "are trying 
to 
assess the results of the elections realistically. Bad or good 
new bodies of power are, we have to work with them." "The 
experience of their work will be used in drawing up new laws on 
the basic principles of local self-government, on basic 
functions of the bodies of power in the subjects of the 
federation and on guarantees of the voters' rights," he said.

  [Text] Somewhat more than 25 percent of the electorate came 
to the polls in Sunday's second round of voting in the 
parliamentary election in the Russian republic of Chuvashia, 
said a spokesman for the republic's Central Electoral Commission. 
  He told INTERFAX on Monday that, as a result, 21 more seats 
were filled of the future legislature's total of 47, in addition 
to seven obtained during the first round. This still fails to 
reach the minimum of 32 necessary to make the new parliament's 
decisions valid. 
  With its former parliament dissolved, Chuvashia will for an 
indefinite time have no legislature, the spokesman said. 
Legislative authority will temporarily be vested in the 
presidium of the previous parliament, headed by the latter's 
speaker, Eduard Kuborev.

  [Text] Despite low participation -- about 40 percent of 
voters took part in the elections -- preliminary results 
indicate the elections are valid. The Central Electoral 
Commission also has information that in two regions, Samara and 
Magadan oblasts, the necessary 25 percent threshold has not been 
reached. In other regions, local bodies of legislative power 
have already been formed to two-thirds or even completely, which 
enables them to start working immediately. 
  Representatives of the president's apparatus, have analyzed 
the results of the elections and are saying the level of 
conservatism in the elected representative bodies of power will 
be considerable. According to the same source, rural voters, who 
gave their votes to socialist candidates, were the most active.

<F P=106> [Report by S. Alekseyeva: "Benefits of a Vacation in Sochi"] </F>
  [Text] Krasnodar -- After B. Yeltsin left Sochi, all the 
newspapers here noted with one voice: The president's vacation 
was chiefly beneficial to...Krasnodar Kray. Kuban Governor N. 
Yegorov and Sochi Mayor N. Karpov had more intensive contact 
with him this time than ever before. Yegorov acknowledged that 
in two weeks they had five meetings with the president, and 
quite long ones at that -- from 1.5 to 14 hours. The local 
leaders were able to obtain from these contacts the maximum 
benefit for their region, and to resolve questions which usually 
take a very long time to resolve (or, more often, not to 
resolve). 
  Thus, the president's consent was obtained for the 
introduction of a visa system in Krasnodar Kray. This means 
that people living in the nearby foreign countries will now be 
able to visit the Kuban only on special invitations, with entry 
visas, and by virtue of paying to register with the local organs 
(this will not apply to citizens of Russia). The question of 
stationing additional military formations in the kray's 
territory was also decided -- specifically, one army division 
and one division of internal troops -- in order to strengthen 
security in the region as well as preventing possible 
interethnic conflicts. B. Yeltsin gave the "go-ahead" for the 
allocation of 434 billion rubles to the kray to provide 
amenities for servicemen's families, something that the military 
men themselves and the kray's organs of power have long been 
asking for. In short, O. Lobov was instructed to prepare a 
whole list of questions relating to strengthening the security 
of the kray -- which is now a border region -- for examination 
in the Security Council. 
  And that is not all. The president promised to sign an edict 
on the development of the resort of Anapa as an all-Russian 
children's health resort. Anapa was an all-Union children's 
health resort before, but in the years of reform it fell, like 
all of us, into a total decline, so now we will recreate what we 
ourselves destroyed. B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin, who 
visited him in Sochi, also backed the kray's initiative on 
building new cargo ports on the Black Sea at Sochi and Anapa, 
and special government decrees will probably be adopted on this 
matter in the near future. 
  They even succeeded in obtaining a written petition from the 
president of Russia to the International Olympic Committee on 
holding the Winter Olympics in Sochi in the year 2002. 
  Last, and most important: During the presidential vacation a 
decision was adopted on drawing up a special treaty (agreement) 
between Krasnodar Kray and the federal organs of power on the 
demarcation of rights and powers (similar to the one that it is 
planned to conclude with Kaliningrad Oblast), which 
substantially boosts the kray's status as a component of the 
Federation. 
  I cannot help being pleased for my native land. If the 
state's top men continue to take regular vacations on our coast, 
the Kuban will soon become the most prosperous region in Russia. 
But I cannot help sympathizing with those oblasts, especially 
in remote parts of Russia, where the president and the premier 
never stop by.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz 28 Mar, TASS -- North Ossetian President 
Akhsarbek Galazov confirmed on Monday his proposal to hold a 
summit meeting with Ingush leader Ruslan Aushev to discuss ways 
to restore peace and stability in the region. 
  "My peace-making initiative -- to meet with Ingush President 
Ruslan Aushev on 2 April -- aims at finding ways to reach peace 
and accord between the peoples of the two Republics and work out 
principles and mechanisms of implementation of the presidential 
decree `on the procedure for returning refugees and displaced 
persons to the places of their permanent residence in the 
Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia,'" Galazov said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Galazov said that there has 
been no official response from Ingushetia so far. Meanwhile, 
North Ossetian Government and parliament have set up a working 
group to hold talks with the Ingush side in the city of Terek on 
29 March to decide on the venue of the summit meeting, its 
agenda and composition of the official delegations. The working 
group is headed by Vice-Prime Minister Georgiy Dzhigkayev. 
  Galazov confirmed that the Ossetian side had thoroughly 
studied the package of documents concerning the mechanism of 
implementation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree on 
refugees. The documents lay a legal foundation for normalising 
relations between the two nations and restoring peace and accord 
in the region. 
  Galazov stressed that the situation in the zone of the state 
of emergency remains complex, but is controlled by the Russian 
peace-keeping troops and North Ossetian law enforcement bodies.

  [Text] Tatarstan offers its services as a mediator at the 
negotiations between Russia and Chechenya. 
  In his exclusive interview with INTERFAX on Saturday 
Tatarstan's Vice Premier Vasily Likhachev declared that Kazan 
positively appreciates the start of the negotiations between 
Moscow and Groznyy. In his words, "We are happy with another 
aspects of the negotiations as well; the question concerns the 
fact that one of the factors which positively affect this 
process is the treaty between the Russian Federation and the 
Republic of Tatarstan, as both Moscow and Groznyy recognized." 
  "Given this factor and Tatarstan's growing political 
authority, I'd like to declare about our readiness, as well as 
about my private readiness, to take an active part in the 
development of bilateral agreements under the mutual approval of 
the delegations of the Russian Federation and Chechenya. 
Without substituting the efforts of the direct participants of 
the negotiations, we could render assistance in creation of an 
atmosphere of confidence, strengthening of the dialogue, and 
creation of a mechanism for permanent consultations of these 
parties," declared Likhachev. 
  In his words, Tatarstan's peacemaking efforts are grounded 
on 
a sound sense and the need to strengthen historic, cultural, and 
economic ties of the peoples and the strive to create democratic 
Russia. 
  "Tatarstan is ready for a mediation mission to solve other 
disputable issues on the territory of Russia and the CIS as 
well, -- declared Likhachev. -- We are ready to discuss the 
issue on opening of an Euro-Asian Center for International 
Cooperation in Kazan with all interested states and 
international organizations." 
  In his opinion, the nature of relations between Russia and 
Chechenya slightly differs from the relations between Tatarstan 
and Russia primarily "by a tougher position on the part of 
Groznyy and maximization of its demands." "The political and 
economic situation in Chechenya also differs from ours. But 
there are several factors which coincide," he noted. 
  Likhachev believes that the negotiations between Moscow and 
Groznyy must discuss a special status for Chechenya.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Asuyev] </F>
  [Text] Groznyy 28 Mar, TASS -- A Chechen opposition leader 
praised today the State Duma's resolution on a political 
settlement between Russia and its self-styled Republic of 
Chechnya. The statement was adopted on Friday by Russia's lower 
house. 
  Yaragi Mamodayev, chairman of the government of national 
confidence dissolved by Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, told 
ITAR-TASS that the resolution "was wise if somewhat 
over-politicized." 
  Mamodayev praised the desire of the Russian lawmakers to 
resolve the problem strictly by peaceful means without turning 
to force. "That is what our government has been fighting for, 
and as we see now, not in vain," he said. 
  On the other hand, Mamodayev criticised the resolution for 
its appeal to the opposition forces in Chechnya. "We always 
insisted that our compatriots should not be divided into pro- 
and anti-president forces. On the contrary, we always called 
for consolidation around the idea of building the Chechen 
state," he said. 
  In its resolution, the State Duma suggested that President 
Yeltsin take measures to achieve a political settlement in 
relations between federal state bodies and the authorities of 
the Chechen Republic. 
  The resolution empowered the Russian Government to hold 
consultations with representatives of Chechen state bodies and 
political movements in order to overcome the current social and 
political problems, and to draft a powers-sharing treaty between 
Moscow and Groznyy. 
  The Duma called for the signing of such a treaty under the 
conditions that the Chechnya Republic hold free elections and 
recognise itself as a subject of the Russian Federation. 
  According to Mamodayev, it is unlikely that the present 
Chechen leadership will agree with the resolution. "For Dudayev 
himself to recognise that Chechnya is a part of Russia would be 
`political harakiri'," he said. 
  Official Groznyy is surprisingly calm. Neither Dudayev nor 
any of his supporters commented on the resolution during the 
weekend. 
  Whatever their response might be, ITAR-TASS has learnt from 
a 
reliable source that a rather highly-ranked Chechen delegation 
is getting ready to leave for Moscow, apparently to continue the 
negotiations with Russia which started last week.

  [Text] Spies are stepping up their activities in Russia and 
in Bryansk Oblast, however strange that might seem. The 
increased activities of foreign special services was noted by 
Maj-Gen. Vladimir Bobrovskiy, head of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service directorate in Bryansk Oblast. 
Military and defense installations, as well as the region's 
military potential, are of special interest to them. For 
example, a hotel room was recently equipped as a center capable 
of monitoring the work of the technical services of a military 
aerodrome situated nearby. However, Bryansk's 
counterintelligence agents detained the visitors to the town in 
time.

  [Text] The Sakhalin Oblast department of the Russian 
Federal Counterintelligence Service summed up the results of its 
operations for last year. According to the department's data, 
workers' efforts resulted in the halting of the illegal export 
by ship of 24 tonnes of nonferrous metals, 110 tonnes of Alaskan 
pollock roe, and a large quantity of marine products valued at 
722 million rubles [R]. 
  The investigation of criminal matters by the department's 
investigators last year resulted in the confiscation of 
R11,915,000, $900,000 in U.S. currency, items and valuables 
worth R3.2 billion, 338 grams of marijuana, more than 15 kg of 
mercury, and a large quantity of ammunition. 
Counterintelligence operatives uncovered and prevented a number 
of attempts by using fake documents to defraud the oblast banks 
of an amount that altogether exceeded R4 billion. Federal 
Counterintelligence Service staffers estimate that as a result 
of their operations, they have prevented an economic loss to 
Russia totalling R5.8 billion. 
  According to information from the service's staffers, they 
are currently tracking the development of contacts between 
Japanese yakuza [Japanese underworld] and Russian mafia 
structures aimed at smuggling fish and marine products and 
establishing channels for delivering firearms and drugs to Japan 
using fishing vessels and the merchant fleet.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Begin recording by Yelena 
Kulevich, Central Electoral Committee press service spokesman]. 
Repeated voting will be held in Kiev's 21 constituencies, in 18 
constituencies in Crimea, in 32 constituencies in Dnepropetrovsk 
oblast, in six constituencies in Ivano-Frankovsk, in 17 
constituencies in Vinnitsa, and in all four constituencies in 
Sevastopol. Why the repeated elections? Because not a single 
candidate has gathered 50 percent of votes. We had the 
situation when there were on average 13 candidates in each 
constituency. There were constituencies with 31 candidates, 32, 
or 28 candidates. It is very difficult to chose in such a 
situation. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Altogether, about 40 deputies to a new 
parliament 
were elected in the first round of voting. Our correspondent 
has learned this at the republican embassy in Moscow. More 
details about the elections from Vadym Dolganov, press attache 
of the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow. 
  [Begin Dolganov recording] Those elected include the former 
Ukrainian prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. He gathered 91 percent 
of votes in his constituency in Dnepropetrovsk. Also in the 
lead is the current parliamentary speaker Ivan Plyushch. He 
also has splendid results - 71 per cent of votes. Furthermore, 
Volodymyr Pylypchuk, who headed the permanent commission on 
issues of economic reform, and the well-known Stepan Khmara also 
became deputies to the new parliament. The former vice premier 
Volodymyr Lanovyy, an economist and reformer, also had a good 
lead. Dmytro Pavlychko, the chairman of the permanent 
commission on international issues of the former parliament, was 
not elected. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The Ukrainian diplomat also stressed that none 
of 
the deputies was elected in Nikolayev oblast, and only one 
deputy in Zaporozhye. The second round of voting to the 
Ukrainian parliament is to be held in three weeks.

  [Text] Elections for the Supreme Council of Crimea have 
been held. Only one deputy was elected to the Simferopol, the 
Ukrainian parliament. According to information from the Central 
Electoral Commission of Crimea, valid elections for the 
Republic's Supreme Council have been held in 64 of the 66 
constituencies. They were invalid in Yevpatoriya and Yalta 
constituencies, where fewer than 50 percent of the electorate 
turned up. Six deputies were elected in the first round of the 
territorial electoral districts, three of them in Kerch. All 
elected deputies are supporters of the "Rossiya" bloc. As 
Viktor Alsufyev, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission of 
Crimea said on 28 March, the overwhelming majority of candidates 
who went through to the second round also belong to the 
"Rossiya" bloc. 
  According to preliminary reports, at the proportional 
elections (14 seats out of a total of 99) the "Rossiya" bloc won 
65.7 percent; the Communist Party of Crimea, 10.9 percent; the 
Party for the Economic Revival of Crimea, 7 percent; the Union 
in Support of the Republic of Crimea, 3 percent; and the Crimean 
Party of Social Guarantees, 2.8 percent. In Sevastopol the 
elections were invalid in several districts. However, one 
deputy, Serhiy Shuryha, who is the owner of the Kondratyevskyy 
trading house, was elected in the first round. Figures for the 
national districts are still being computed. Members of the 
Central Electoral Commission of Crimea are forecasting with 
considerable conviction that more than 10 of the 14 seats will 
be occupied by representatives of the kurultay of the Crimean 
Tatar people. 
  The presidential team will take care of the opinion poll of 
Crimean citizens. As yet there are no final results. However, 
as representatives of the "Rossiya" bloc have said, over 70 
percent of the electorate supported Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov on all three questions. It is also estimated that more 
than 70 percent of the Crimean parliament's deputy corps will be 
controlled by the "Rossiya" bloc. 
  According to information from the Crimean parliament's 
apparatus, valid elections for the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
have been. Only one deputy was elected.

TASS] 
  [Text] Kiev 28 Mar, TASS -- The real danger to the 
Ukrainian parliament, if it is elected, will come neither from 
extreme leftists nor rightists represented in it, but from the 
strength of "non-party nomenclature," which will hamper the 
creation of a clear cut structured parliament capable of 
conducting reforms, this apprehension was expressed by Ukraine's 
Rukh [Ukrainian People's Movement for Perestroyka] Party leader 
Vyacheslav Chornovil. He was analysing the preliminary results 
of elections to the republic's Supreme Soviet at a press 
conference today. 
  According to Chornovil, far more candidates, supported by 
Rukh and democratic forces than were expected, have entered the 
second round of the elections to the Ukrainian parliament. The 
Rukh leader himself received over 62 per cent of the total 
number of votes cast today. The most important thing is not to 
let the second round of the elections disrupted, Vyacheslav 
Chornovil said. 
  When asked whether he will present himself as a candidate 
for 
the probable presidential elections, Chornovil said that this 
question will be decided at the second stage of the V Congress 
of Rukh scheduled to be held in the second half of April.

Council, Crimea's Central Electoral Commission and Parliament 
Chairman Viktor Alsufyev held a news conference on the Crimean 
Supreme Council election's preliminary results. He stressed

service, has said the results of the poll on Crimea's status 
will be known within the next two days.
