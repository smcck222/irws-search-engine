  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The Federal Defense Ministry and 
the naval industry are to push ahead with a submarine program 
worth several billion Deutschmarks [DM] before the Bundestag 
election [on 16 October]. That way they want to avoid a 
possible lack of political consensus following a change of 
government in Bonn, the BERLINER ZEITUNG (Monday edition) 
reports. According to the report, the industry will save the 
Defense Ministry quite a few million marks in interest if the 
latter pushes through the procurement of four new U 212-type 
submarines worth DM 2.8 billion before the election. 
  The industry is prepared to bring forward the construction 
work on the four new submarines to 1995, the report says. 
According to a report from the naval arms working group, the 
project was "of such crucial importance" to the industry that 
the industry would be prepared to allow interest-free advance 
financing. In return the Defense Ministry is to yield to the 
industry's demand for "definite plans" that "the project will be 
dealt with in parliament before the Bundestag election on 16 
October 1994."

<F P=106> [Report by "hen": "Bonn Will Withdraw From Many Companies </F>
in the Future"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- On Thursday [24 February] the Federal 
Cabinet approved the intention of Finance Minister Theo Waigel, 
Christian Social Union [CSU], to privatize a number of federal 
companies either completely or in part in the near future. The 
biggest of the candidates for privatization is the Deutsche 
Lufthansa AG in Cologne, where, in Waigel's view, the framework 
conditions for a withdrawal of the Federal Government are 
extremely favorable at the moment. In a few days he expects an 
expert clarification on the problem of Lufthansa's pension 
obligations. 
  Upon Waigel's proposal, the Federal Cabinet came out in 
favor 
of further reducing the number of the Federal Government's 
company participations and real estate holdings. The latest 
participation report by the Federal Government shows a total 
number of 410 direct and indirect participations at the end of 
1992. The cabinet stressed that the privatization policy, as 
the most important part of Bonn's action program for more growth 
and employment, has high economic priority. In the future, it 
must be an absolute exception to have tasks done by the state or 
to keep tasks within the state's sphere of responsibility if 
these tasks could be done just as well by private persons. The 
privatization policy, which has been pursued by Kohl's 
government since 1982, has yielded total revenues of about 11.6 
billion German marks [DM] so far. 
  The financial scope of future privatizations at the federal 
level (without real estate holdings) will, however, rather run 
into the "one-digit billions." Only by including the Federal 
Government's special assets -- Telekom, above all -- can a 
double-digit billion sum be expected in the medium term. Waigel 
appealed to the laender and communities to follow the example of 
the Federal Government on their own responsibility and to also 
privatize their comprehensive participations. The Federal 
Government will support this process by amending the budget 
principle law. 
  Among the short-term privatization measures the Cabinet 
approved are, in addition to Lufthansa, the reduction of federal 
participations in the Rhein-Main-Donau AG, the Neckar AG, the 
Bundesanzeiger Verlagsgesellschaft mbH [publishing company], as 
well as the Gesellschaft fuer Nebenbetriebe der Bundesautobahnen 
mbH [company for subsidiary enterprises of the federal 
highways]. The list of short-term privatization measures or 
sales of participations also includes: Deutsche 
Aussenhandelsbank AG [German Foreign Trade Bank], Staatsbank 
Berlin [Berlin State Bank], Genossenschafts-Holding Berlin-DG 
Bank [Berlin-DG Bank Cooperative Holding], DFA Fertigungs- und 
Anlagenbau GmbH [DFA Assembly and Installation Construction 
Company], Gesellschaft fuer Lagereibetriebe mbH [Warehouse 
company], Heimbetriebsgesellschaft mbH [Homeworkers' company], 
Bayerische Lloyd AG, Osthavellaendische Eisenbahnen AG [eastern 
Havelland railroads], a recreation home in Davos owned by the 
Federal Government, as well as various participations in housing 
construction. 
  The Federal Government is striving for medium-term 
privatization solutions for the future three share-holding 
companies Telekom, Postdienst, and Postbank. At the moment it 
cannot yet be decided which part of the privatization revenues 
from Telekom will go to the company itself because there is 
still a lack of "solid bases for economic assessment," Waigel 
said. In contrast, Federal Post Minister Wolfgang Boetsch (CSU) 
recently gave the impression that he had already come to an 
agreement with Waigel on this controversial issue of the second 
part of the postal reform. 
  According to the federal finance minister, the sale of the 
Federal Government's east German real estate holdings has made 
good progress. So far, real estate property at a value of more 
than DM1.3 billion has been sold and property worth DM2.3 
billion has been restituted to the original owners for free. In 
order to further accelerate the sale, a division of labor 
between the Federal Property Administration and the Trust 
Agency's Property Company (TLG) has been instituted since the 
end of 1993. While the Federal Property Administration 
clarifies the legal and real matters involving real estate 
property, the TLG takes over sales management.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DDP/ADN) -- After the German White-Collar 
Union (DAG), the Public Service and Transport Workers' Union 
(OeTV) has now also called token strikes in all areas of public 
service. 
  Following four hours of talks by the wage negotiation 
committee, OeTV Chairwoman Monika Wulf-Mathies said this 
afternoon in Stuttgart that the token strikes are to take place 
on 28 February and 1 March in eastern and western Germany. In 
this way the union hopes to make the employers more open to 
negotiation at the fourth round on 9 and 10 March. There are to 
be token strikes at various sites throughout Germany.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans Peter Stihl, president of the </F>
Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], 
by Rainer Bittermann; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Bittermann] Mr. Stihl, economic experts and 
politicians, and employers' associations basically agree on one 
point at present: The recession has reached its lowest level, 
it is bottoming out. Yet there is no agreement concerning the 
possible beginning of a recovery. What is the opinion of the 
entrepreneurs with whom you are talking? What view prevails at 
the chambers of commerce and industry? 
  [Stihl] The basis of our assessments is information from 83 
chambers of commerce and industry in Germany that regularly 
brief us on the economic situation, and inform us on the mood in 
enterprises. As a matter of fact, the majority of companies are 
still planning to lay off people, and only a minority is 
considering carrying out future-oriented investments. The 
Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce is able 
to confirm the statement that the recession is finally bottoming 
out. As far as exports are concerned, certain positive signs 
are visible. However, they are not sufficient to trigger a 
strong recovery of the German economy. The question is: How 
long will we remain at the lowest point, and how long will it 
take until positive economic signals from abroad are strong 
enough to trigger a positive development in our country? 
  Taking into consideration developments in the United States, 
in North America generally, in Latin America, and in Southeast 
Asia, we believe that a recovery in Germany will only be 
possible after the classic increase in exports. Yet I think 
that this will take some time. 
  [Bittermann] Does this mean that you believe that a proper 
recovery may not take place before 1995? 
  [Stihl] If we are lucky, we will see certain clear signs in 
the second half of 1994. However, this will not lead to a 
fundamental and sustained recovery in Germany. It might happen 
in 1995. Yet this is mere speculation. [passage omitted] 
  [Bittermann] At present, it looks as though industrial 
action might take place in the metalworking and electrical 
industry in western Germany. Might such a conflict have a 
negative impact on the economic upswing? 
  [Stihl] I believe that labor action is always the last 
resort in wage conflicts. Against the backdrop of the current 
difficult situation, it would be deplorable if economic recovery 
were to be impaired by a large-scale industrial action, which 
would naturally be the case. On the other hand, the 7 March 
date for a strike ballot in Schleswig-Holstein does not mean an 
end to all negotiations. There is still a chance for the 
parties to the wage negotiations to hold another round of talks 
to explore possible solutions before actually calling a strike. 
  By the way, it seems as though the metalworkers trade union 
does not plan a large-scale nationwide strike, but that it 
simply wants to increase pressure to achieve a solution. Yet I 
would like to make one thing completely clear: If the 
metalworkers trade union believe that an increase in wages and 
salaries can really be achieved in the current wage 
negotiations, it is wrong. Most of the enterprises in the 
metalworking and electrical industries are operating at a loss, 
or their profits have declined drastically. They urgently need a 
reduction in costs. If the metalworkers trade union wants to 
preserve the current regulations on collective bargaining 
policies, they will have to face up to the existing conditions 
and reach an agreement that does not entail new burdens for 
enterprises. This means nothing but a zero round. I pointed 
this out as early as in the middle of last year. 
  [Bittermann] It looks as though the trade unions have 
realized that the safeguarding and creation of jobs are 
currently to be given priority over real wage increases. There 
is currently no longer any talk of a 6-percent rise. Do you 
agree? 
  [Stihl] This demand has not been abandoned. Safe jobs would 
require guaranteed orders for the enterprises by the 
metalworkers trade union. This is unrealistic. Trade unions 
cannot provide a guarantee for orders. Thus, the entrepreneurs 
cannot guarantee jobs. This is the wrong approach to wage 
negotiations. By the way, this sphere cannot be regulated 
through wage negotiations. 
  [Bittermann] What measures should be adopted in the sphere 
of collective bargaining policies to increase Germany's 
attractiveness as an industrial base? 
  [Stihl] I am firmly convinced that we made big mistakes in 
the past few years, particularly concerning the lower-wage 
groups. Wage groups one and two have been abolished. 
Generally, wages in the lower groups increased 
disproportionally in the past few years. This means that work in 
the lower groups, unskilled labor, has become very expensive, so 
that it became increasingly necessary for enterprises to use 
machines and adopt rationalization measures. Expensive labor was 
also a reason for them to give up production in Germany and 
transfer jobs abroad. This is currently occurring in many 
sectors. 
  If we want to create more jobs in Germany, we must also 
create the possibility for cheaper work through wage 
negotiations, not only in the form of part-time work but by 
reintroducing wage groups one and two. 
  [Bittermann] What do you think is the reason for the 
exacerbation of the wage conflict? Generally, it was believed 
that readiness for industrial action would not be too great in 
view of the current weak economic situation. 
  [Stihl] If the industry is facing an economic situation in 
which it does not see another way out except by reducing costs, 
its resistance against demands for a 6-percent raise increases. 
The fact that the metalworkers trade union called for a 
6-percent increase showed from the outset that it has completely 
lost touch with economic realities. The enterprises themselves 
exerted massive pressure on their own organization by demanding 
a reduction of real costs. This is the reason it is so 
difficult for both sides to achieve a sensible solution. 
  [Bittermann] Do you still see an opportunity for a 
negotiated settlement, or are strikes -- even limited ones -- 
inevitable? 
  [Stihl] If an industrial action should actually take place, 
it will only be possible for a relatively short time to limit it 
to certain areas because the enterprises and the metalworkers 
trade union will be forced to expand the strikes as quickly as 
possible to ensure a quick end. It would not be fair for a few 
enterprises to have to endure the strikes in lieu of many others. 
  However, I believe that it is still possible to achieve a 
solution through negotiations. In the meantime it has also 
become known in trade union circles that numerous German 
enterprises are producing losses instead of profits, and that 
wage increases are therefore not really possible. To illustrate 
this, one can use the picture of a cake that has become smaller 
in 1994. The piece of cake that the metalworkers trade union 
claims for itself cannot become larger, simply because others 
are not ready to give up their piece of cake in favor of the 
metalworking trade union. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by "J.L.": "Increase in Export Surplus"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt, 22 Feb -- The surplus in German exports 
increased strongly again last year. According to the Federal 
Statistical Office, the positive balance amounted to 59.4 
billion German marks [DM] (1992: DM33.7 billion). This was due 
to the fact that imports dropped more strongly than exports. 
While exports decreased by 10.1 percent to DM603.5 billion, 
imports went down 14.7 percent to a level of DM544.1 billion. 
As a result of deficits in the sphere of services and 
transfers, the export surplus was transformed in a deficit of 
DM36 billion (DM39.4 billion) in the balance of payments on 
current account. In December, the export surplus reached DM8.5 
billion (DM0.4 billion), while the deficit in the balance of 
payments on current account was DM0.8 billion (DM4.9 billion). 
Compared to November, exports increased by 4.2 percent to a 
level of DM56.4 billion, thus being 2.2 percent higher than the 
December 1992 level. Imports were up 2.8 percent on the 
previous month, reaching a level of DM47.9 billion, thus 
remaining 12.5 percent below the level of the end of 1992.

<F P=106> [Report by "deu": "Scharping for Rigid Austerity Course"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- In the event of the assumption of power, 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will ensure the 
equalization of burdens similar to the scheme adopted after 
World War II to gradually finance German unity. First of all, 
the "number of shadow budgets linked with German unity must be 
combined under one budget" so that the overall cost is clear to 
the citizens, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping stated at a meeting 
of the "Frankfurt Circle," a left-wing forum within the SPD, in 
Oer-Erkenschwick. He mentioned the sum of 750 billion German 
marks [DM]. To raise this sum, he mainly wants to focus on the 
owners of large assets. "Everybody will have to make a 
reasonable contribution." The SPD's candidate for chancellor 
left it open whether a levy on property should be introduced, 
whether the assessed value for land should be adapted, or 
whether government bonds should be issued. 
  Scharping stated that all planned financial and economic 
measures that are currently being drafted for the SPD government 
program are serving two goals: Taxes and fees must not be 
increased beyond the level planned for 1995. "The same applies 
to state indebtedness." Within this framework, however, numerous 
adjustments are required. 
  Scharping's statements met with criticism among the 
left-leaning SPD members. Several speakers pointed out that 
such a strict financial framework does not leave enough leeway 
for reducing mass unemployment. However, Scharping clearly 
rejected efforts to concentrate primarily on employment programs 
financed by the state in the fight against unemployment. What 
is needed is an intelligent combination of various 
possibilities. "We must make the productive forces of society 
visible to a greater extent and not simply rely on the state," 
he stressed. 
  Scharping emphatically pleaded in favor of a "very reserved" 
use of promises during the election campaign. "I will not 
support anything that cannot be realized between 1994 and 1998," 
he pointed out. "Otherwise we will have to face the 
consequences in 1998, and the whole democratic system will be 
discredited." Yet it is certain that the SPD wants to withdraw 
the abolition of the bad weather allowance. Moreover, 
developments in eastern Germany must be assessed realistically. 
Currently, about DM150 billion annually are being transferred 
from eastern to western Germany. "If this does not change, 
eastern Germany will reach 70 percent of western economic 
strength in 15 years," the party chairman pointed out. 
  According to Scharping, the "intelligent combination" of 
measures in the fight against unemployment includes 
"environmentally friendly economic growth" and the promotion of 
new technologies. Scharping called for a more far-reaching 
European cooperation concerning communications and environmental 
technologies, genetic engineering, and the transportation 
systems. Generally, he advocated the promotion of investments 
and the reduction of consumptive expenditure. Thus, it is 
necessary to abolish numerous bureaucratic regulations 
preventing investments -- including high standards in the sphere 
of construction, for example. State activities must be 
modernized. In the discussion about the privatization of public 
tasks, Scharping called for an "examination without any taboos," 
while taking into consideration costs, quality, and social 
consequences. "Those who ignore that do not pursue a 
responsible policy." There are also considerations to deduct 
social benefits like family allowance from the tax liability 
instead of having them paid by special authorities.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
announcer Anne Sinclair; from the "Sept sur Sept" program; 
monitored in progress -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Sinclair] We heard today, 
Alain Juppe, that Israel has announced the release of 800-1,000 
Palestinian prisoners, and that 'Arafat considers the Israeli 
proposals to disarm extremists only as superficial, since he is 
asking for the disarming of all the settlers. France has said 
that it condemns the massacre. What can you add to this? 
  [Juppe] Grief, first of all, of course, and our sympathy for 
the families of the casualties. Nothing is sacred any more in 
the world today. Even places of worship are becoming places of 
barbarism and places of killing. 
  [Sinclair] And today in the Lebanon, since today in the 
Lebanon, in a.... 
  [Juppe, interrupting] I was indeed thinking about Juniyah 
too, where people were killed in a church. First and foremost, 
our condemnation and the horror we feel at such barbarism, as 
well as the desire to find out what really happened, since, as 
shown in the reportage you have shown, there are contradictory 
theses. It is necessary to get right to the bottom of what 
really happened. 
  [Sinclair] Have you got an opinion? Do you think that it was 
indeed the act of a madman, as the Israeli government has 
claimed was the case, that is an isolated act? Or do you think 
that it is a genuine plot.... 
  [Juppe, interrupting] I do not have more information than 
you 
do. You know, for six months now, it had been what we feared. 
Let me remind you that there was a declaration of principles on 
13 September, and, over the following days, the mutual 
recognition between Israel and the PLO, the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization. It was a moment of joy at a time when 
the international situation was not always rosy, unfortunately. 
We thought: Peace is on the rails, at last. At the same time, 
we were all aware that all the hawks on all sides, and even the 
madmen on all sides, would do their utmost to break this 
process. This is the question which is being asked today: Will 
the peace process come to a halt? Or will we be able to give it 
another boost? 
  [Sinclair] For you, could this, on the contrary, trigger a 
process which would be a bit quicker? Indeed, things have been 
dragging on since 13 September. 
  [Juppe] This is what should be done, and this is a role 
France can play. Those involved in the peace process will need 
courage for this. I would like to hail those who have committed 
themselves to this; the Israelis, of course, Rabin, Peres, and 
also Yasir 'Arafat, for whom I have special thoughts this 
evening. I raise my hat to him, because he will need courage to 
continue on the way he has chosen. At the same time, it is 
necessary for the Israelis to react quickly and firmly. 
  [Sinclair] What exactly are you expecting from the Israeli 
government? Do you think that the PLO is right when they ask 
for the disarming of all the settlers -- 120,000 of them? 
  [Juppe] It is necessary to disarm all extremist movements 
who 
do not hide the fact that their objective is to halt the peace 
process. Disarming all settlers is a different matter, because 
many of these settlers have also been threatened, and there were 
casualties among Israeli settlers. 
  In any case -- and this is an idea which I support -- it is 
necessary that the disarming of extremist movements and the 
security measures, which are indispensable in the occupied 
territories -- since it is still Israel, the Israeli government 
who is responsible for security -- give rise to the sending of 
UN observers so that they can control whether the proposed 
measures are efficient indeed. 
  It is also necessary for the Israeli government to take 
confidence measures. They should release prisoners, yes, but 
they should do more than that. You said that there were between 
800 and 1,000. I think that there are more than 10,000 in 
Israeli prisons. The issue of settlements must also be raised, 
i.e. the presence of these Israeli settlers in the occupied 
territories. [passage omitted] 
  Change in the daily life of the people in the occupied 
territories -- and especially in Gaza -- is also a credibility 
test for peace. If peace is not better than war, why should the 
people in the occupied territories opt for peace? They must be 
given reasons to choose peace, and this is why their daily life 
must be changed. 
  [Sinclair] You said earlier on that a number of measures 
must 
be taken. The Security Council has met and parted without any 
agreement. They will meet again tomorrow. What are you 
expecting from the Security Council precisely? You said that 
you were expecting it to send UN observers? 
  [Juppe] I for one do not believe in sending an intervention 
force. We can see all the problems this causes, and we will 
probably come back to this later when talking about Bosnia. I 
do believe on the contrary that observers, who make it possible 
to control, to check what is happening, could be useful. It is 
not because the Security Council did not agree on anything 
today, this Sunday, that they should not continue on Monday. 
Experience has proven that tenacity in diplomacy is a cardinal 
virtue. 
  [Sinclair] Alain Juppe, the cease-fire was violated in 
Mostar today. Three mortar shells were fired in Sarajevo 
yesterday. Two Bosnian soldiers were killed in Sarajevo on 
Thursday, and French soldiers were targeted at the airport. It 
is generally agreed that 20-30 percent of Serb batteries may not 
have been totally dismantled. Given the circumstances, can we 
say that the Serbs have yielded -- as you put it in an interview 
with LE MONDE'this week -- or is it a false defeat, as the 
magazine LE POINT put it? 
  [Juppe] Nobody is crying victory, and I am not either, far 
from it. My first reaction last Monday, when we knew what was 
happening after the ultimatum deadline, was to say: This is a 
first step, the main things remain to be done. It is now 
obvious, the most important things remain to be done. Having 
said that, a number of facts must also be recalled. 
  The first fact I would like to recall is that in Sarajevo, 
for three weeks now, there have been no further bombings. Three 
mortar shells were fired, it is true -- as you said -- 
yesterday. One was fired by the Muslims, two by the Serbs. 
However, on the whole, people can now go out on the streets. 
This is a change. 
  [Sinclair] People can go out on the streets, but they cannot 
leave the town. 
  [Juppe] No, of course not, it is only a first step. 
  [Sinclair] There is still no water, no electricity, no 
telephone, and they cannot go out. It is still a besieged town. 
  [Juppe] This is why our next objective -- after this first 
step, which means that children can get out of cellars and go 
sledging in Sarajevo, and I hope it will last, I hope it will 
with all my heart -- we must now come to the next stage 
[sentence as heard]. The next stage is what we call the lifting 
of the siege of Sarajevo. What is a besieged town? It is a 
town one cannot leave, one cannot enter, which supplies do not 
reach normally. We must put an end to all this. This is why we 
have asked -- not to place Sarajevo under UN protection, as the 
report suggested, I took it down on my piece of paper, we never 
used such words ... 
  [Sinclair, interrupting] UN-administered. 
  [Juppe] We suggested it should be administered. We hope -- 
and I hope this will be possible for the Security Council 
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow -- that the United Nations 
will appoint, that the Security Council will appoint a 
high-ranking administrator who will address right away the 
restoration of daily necessities: water, gas, electricity, as 
you have said, and supply facilities. This is the second stage. 
  [Sinclair] You said: It is not protection we advocate, it is 
administration. What is the difference? 
  [Juppe] There is a significant difference. 
  [Sinclair] Does it mean that UN troops will be in Sarajevo 
for 20 years, as was the case in Berlin? 
  [Juppe] This is another matter, because, beyond Sarajevo and 
the effective lifting of the siege, that is the restoration of 
almost normal conditions of life in that town -- which cannot be 
taken for granted yet -- we have other two tasks to carry out. 
  First of all, we must deal with the other zones in Bosnia 
where fighting is still taking place: Mostar, Maglaj, and 
others. This is why France, in the draft resolution which is 
currently being discussed by the Security Council at the 
initiative of France, has also suggested that the list of safety 
zones should be extended. 
  And finally, it is necessary to think about the global peace 
plan, because, as I have said on several occasions, all these 
operations will not make any sense if there is no political 
settlement. 
  [Simclair] I would like to come back to Sarajevo, just a 
couple of words. Is Sarajevo the capital of Bosnia or is it 
not? If it is, the capital of which Bosnia? Or will it be a 
town with a special status -- this is why I mentioned Berlin? 
  [Juppe] No, there is no doubt today. As long as Bosnia- 
Herzegovina is a UN member-state -- which is the case -- its 
capital will be in Sarajevo and the Bosnian government is the 
government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is why, a while ago, I 
dismissed the word "protection." The aim is not to place the 
Bosnian government under any protection. The aim is to make 
sure that the necessities of daily life can be met as quickly as 
possible in Sarajevo. 
  Who are our opponents today in that race against time, if I 
may put it this way -- but time goes by so slowly in Bosnia that 
the expression may not be relevant. We have two opponents, 
three maybe. First of all, the inability of those signing 
documents to respect what they signed. There has been some talk 
about a fresh cease-fire between Croats and Muslims. You saw 
that a few hours later, it was violated again. It is thus 
necessary to maintain the threat, this seems vital to me. 
Fortunately, France is there to say it, together with a few 
others, the Americans especially. It is not because the 
ultimatum deadline is behind us that the threat is no longer 
there. The possibility to use air strikes to gag those who would 
not respect their commitments must be maintained. 
  [Sinclair] I wanted to ask you something on this subject. 
When does one consider that commitments are not honored? Is 
there not a difference about this between NATO and the United 
Nations? The United Nations seems to be dreading military 
actions against the Serbs. This is what we saw the other day at 
Tuzla airport. Tuzla, after all, was declared a zone protected 
by NATO as far back as January. However, not only has Tuzla not 
been re-opened -- there has been some talk of the 7 March 
deadline, the United Nations extended it to the 18th [pauses], 
when does one consider that all the conditions are met for the 
threat to be used, as you put it? 
  [Juppe] I am not the one who will decide. I am the minister 
of foreign affairs, I am not an officer, I am not on the ground. 
We have devised a precise procedure. It is up to the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] command, and you know who exercises 
it; a French general in Sarajevo, General Soubirou; a British 
general for the whole of Bosnia, General Rose; a French general 
for the whole of Yugoslavia, General Cot. It is up to them, who 
are on the ground, to say: In this particular case, we are 
asking for permission to use air strikes. We, the politicians, 
have said that we were ready to do so. In Tuzla, the question 
has been raised indeed, and I personally called the UN secretary 
general to tell him: If the UNPROFOR command ask you to order 
air strikes, I would like to tell you that France agrees to 
that, because the conditions were met. 
  [Sinclair] Do you believe that the UN forces staff were 
timorous? 
  [Juppe] It is up to the staff to decide; don't expect me to 
pass sentence on soldiers who are risking their lives on the 
ground. I said earlier that we had three enemies. I mentioned 
the inability of the belligerents to keep their word. The 
second enemy, or the second adversary, if I may say so, is the 
UN lack of resources, and I believe that this must be repeated 
again. It is not enough to vote through resolutions in the 
Security Council; money and troops are also needed. When 
security safe havens were set up, the UN secretary general said: 
I need an extra 7,500 soldiers to guarantee their existence. 
Only three countries in the world answered his call, which one? 
First, in July 1993, France which sent an extra 1,000 soldiers. 
Then two small countries, and this much to their credit, the 
Netherlands and Nordic countries [as heard]. 
  [Sinclair] When we read your remarks in LE MONDE, you 
clearly 
called on the Americans to join us today. 
  [Juppe] I call on everyone. In this tragedy everyone is 
lecturing us. I believe France has paid its fair share and even 
more than that, I recall that we had many killed on the ground. 
Finally, our third enemy, is the dissipation of diplomatic 
efforts. You showed it earlier in a video clip, negotiations are 
currently under way everywhere, In New York, in Bonn, in Geneva. 
  [Sinclair] We will come around to this later. When you say 
more soldiers are needed, it must be understood that to run 
Sarajevo and all the other zones, that every time the Serbs pull 
back from positions they hold, these must be occupied by UN 
soldiers, this explains why more men are needed. 
  [Juppe] Obviously. 
  [Sinclair] Now to return to the issue of other safe havens, 
particularly the Muslim enclaves in Serb territory such as 
Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica, and others, do you believe that the 
same method used in Sarajevo, namely an ultimatum, should be 
used? 
  [Juppe] I believe that today, the ultimatum as a method is 
not justified. 
  [Sinclair] Why? 
  [Juppe] Because it is an unwieldy tool and because 
conditions 
are met to use force. Let's take the example of Tuzla. What 
was decided regarding Tuzla on several occasions, the last time 
on 10 and 11 January? Things are decided and then people are 
needed to recall what had been decided and to get things moving. 
It was decided to reopen the airport. [Juppe explains with 
help of map] It is an airport which is in a Muslim zone, the 
green zone [on the map], but it is under the threat of Serb 
guns. What was decided? It was decided to reopen the airport 
simply to dispatch humanitarian aid which is only reaching 
Sarajevo airport. 
  [Sinclair] It must be recalled that a million and a half 
people rely on this humanitarian aid in this region. 
  [Juppe] It is obvious that if aircraft could land here with 
food and medical supplies this would greatly help the action of 
non- governmental organizations and of the United Nations. The 
Serbs are refusing and say: If aircraft land, they will bring 
in weapons in the Muslim zone. The Atlantic Alliance decided to 
go in regardless and said that if the Serbs were opposing this 
and were shelling then they would be neutralized by the use of 
air power. 
  [Sinclair] That was back in January. 
  [Juppe] Yes, indeed. We were told from New York that this 
would take place on 7 March, this was then postponed to 18 
March. I believe that it takes a great deal of time and that 
this operation could take place much earlier if a stronger 
political will were expressed. The same holds for Srebrenica 
[showing it on the map], a Muslim enclave within a Serb zone, 
where freedom of movement does not exist anymore. Once more the 
Atlantic Alliance has decided to restore this freedom to enable 
UN convoys and troops to move freely. In this case we have been 
discussing this for two months or six weeks, this is under way, 
but with great difficulties. 
  [Sinclair] I am asking my question again: Do you believe 
that the United Nations is not as willing to react to this 
situation as NATO, which seems to be taking resolutions which 
have been followed by results in Sarajevo but not in these zones? 
  [Juppe] Yes and no, but this is in keeping with the nature 
of 
each one of these organizations. What is NATO? It is a 
military alliance. What is the United Nations? It is an 
organization dispatching peace soldiers. Therefore, it is not 
unusual for the logic of the two organizations to be different 
and this is why the Alliance had to step in to support the 
United Nations. 
  [Sinclair] I can sense your impatience. 
  [Juppe] You see, as far as this case is concerned, if I were 
not impatient I would be unaware, well I have been trying to do 
something for the past 11 months and I can see that it is 
difficult. [passage omitted] 
  The sensitive issue of access to the sea [for Bosnia] is 
that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina stops here, as we can see on this map. If we 
want to have access to the sea we must move through Croat 
territory, through Croatia itself, and the Croats are saying, we 
will not cut our own territory, we will not isolate Dubrovnik, 
therefore we refuse. We found a way to solve this issue which 
is one of the issues under discussion in New York today, it is 
to attempt to get Croats and Muslims together and to set up what 
we call a Croatian-Muslim federation. With this condition it 
seems that the issue of access to the sea could be solved more 
easily. This is a path which must be explored, it worries me 
somehow and I will tell you why. It looks as if in current 
diplomatic talks every issue is being dealt with bit by bit. We 
try to get Croats and Muslims to agree, and I am simply asking 
what will happen later with the Serbs? We must not forget that 
no global peace will be achieved if we do not reach a solution 
acceptable to all parties. Therefore I find it extremely 
important -- I was mentioning diplomatic efforts -- to get 
together all the pieces of the puzzle. 
  [Sinclair] The Russians made proposals for an international 
conference but Western countries -- with the exception of 
Germany -- do not seem to fully agree, why? 
  [Juppe] The idea as such is not bad. However, the Russians 
made proposals for an international meeting at the highest 
possible level, that of heads of state and governments. Can you 
imagine President Yeltsin, President Clinton, President 
Mitterrand and a few others meeting tomorrow or the day after? 
To decide what? An international conference must be prepared, 
we will be in favor of such a conference the day we have made 
progress, the day we have outlined a preliminary agreement 
between all parties. Meanwhile, and this must take place 
rapidly, this week, next week, talks at the level of experts, 
possibly at the level of ministers must move forward in order to 
find a solution acceptable to all. 
  [Sinclair] When we speak of an agreement acceptable to all, 
what does it mean? The old Bosnian dream of a multi-ethnic 
Bosnia is over. Today we regret this Bosnia which has 
disappeared forever and we are moving toward something else, 
namely toward a Bosnia divided into several ethnically 
homogeneous republics, if I may so. 
  [Juppe] In France we are lucky enough to have many 
ideologues 
who have set ideas, who have plans for Bosnia and their plans 
are that Bosnia should be a united state in which various ethnic 
groups would live together, as they are saying. 
  [Sinclair] This was initially a Bosnian dream, before being 
adopted by the ideologues. 
  [Juppe] Yes, but this dream does not fit reality any more, 
we 
must have the courage to say so. I am not convinced that we are 
helping the peace process by brandishing this idea which has 
been superseded by events today. First, I strongly question the 
use of the term multi-ethnic, this is the same people; cultures 
and religions are different but this is one people. When three 
communities have been tearing each other apart for several 
months, for several years, when they have been killing each 
other, raping each other and so on, how can you -- even if you 
are writing for a famous French weekly -- decide that they will 
be forced to live with each other? This is why the whole of the 
European Union, in agreement with the [warring] parties, moved 
toward the preservation of a Bosnia-Herzegovina member of the 
United Nations but made up of three entities: a Croat entity, a 
Muslim entity and a Serb entity maintaining very flexible links 
between themselves. The percentage of territory to be given to 
each one of this community was even very precisely drawn up. 
They accepted this and what I am wishing now is that we will 
not move too far away from this plan. 
  [Sinclair] [passage omitted] When you say I question the 
term 
multi-ethnic, are you also questioning the term ethnic cleansing 
used this week again by the former Polish prime minister, 
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who is the author of a report for the United 
Nations. He said this week that 2 million people had been 
forcibly displaced in this war and that ethnic cleansing was 
still continuing. 
  [Juppe] I never questioned this. I am simply speaking of 
religious cleansing, these are religious communities, Orthodox, 
Catholic, Muslim caught in the middle. 
  [Sinclair] There has not been any similar movement of 
population in Europe since the war. 
  [Juppe] In Europe, but -- and this does not excuse these -- 
there were others elsewhere, when India and Pakistan divided in 
1947, millions of people were displaced. There were movements 
of populations between Greece and Turkey too following the 
Trianon Treaty, and I condemn them. 
  [Sinclair] Europe had another idea, namely to ban this on 
the 
continent. You hope that the diplomatic process will be cleared 
on the ground before this international conference which, I 
believe, you would like to be held in Paris following a French 
initiative. 
  [Juppe] Why not? But this is not the issue, I believe that 
we should avoid any kind of chauvinistic behavior or 
competition, we must find ways to an agreement. I am tempted to 
say that the best peace agreement is not the one which is 
decreed to be the best following questionable norms, but the one 
accepted by all parties. [passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] Before we discuss French politics, let us talk 
about Algeria. The leader of the Armed Islamic Group was killed 
by the Algerian security forces today. This group threatened 
foreigners and all those who may cooperate with the Algerian 
government, and claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of 
French nationals, including that of the Thevenot couple. 
  There is endless violence in Algeria, an extremely difficult 
economic situation and the danger of social unrest. Where do 
you place General Zeroual's action against such a background? 
  [Juppe] I would like to quote President Mitterrand. I 
believe he used this sentence about Bosnia: This concerns us. 
I don't think I need to explain why, apart from history, 
geographic closeness, and the importance for France to find a 
stable partner in Algeria. Because the instability in Algeria, 
the destabilization of northern Africa -- I need not go on -- we 
know what sort of results this can bring. I would like to pay 
homage to Mr. Joachim Grau, who has just been featured [in video 
report]. This interview [with him, last January] was moving, he 
explained that he had always lived there and that was his 
country -- he is the sixth French national to be killed. 
  I would like to repeat -- I believe it is my duty to do so 
-- 
that we have taken every precaution to protect our community, 
which is significantly large there. Two-thirds of the children 
registered with French schools have returned to France. The 
number of diplomatic staff has been reduced. Relatives of 
private companies' employees working there have also returned, 
but none of these measures can be one hundred percent effective. 
The solution must come from Algeria, this is self-evident. For 
months now, we have been saying that first of all the Algerian 
economy must be reformed because what has been taking place 
there, in Algeria, is the result of 30 years of economic chaos 
and the blatant failure of a collectivized economy. Things must 
change. 
  [Sinclair] The IMF has firmly asked for.... 
  [Juppe, interrupting] Absolutely. The main news is that over 
the last three or four months, the Algerian government has 
established contacts with the IMF, has negotiated with the IMF 
and we, the French and the Europeans, have said that, should 
there be an agreement, we would be ready to offer Algeria our 
help so that it may try and get out of its economic slump which 
is fuelling the young people's unease. 
  The second prerequisite is that there should be political 
dialogue. As General Zeroual himself said, the security 
solution is not a solution at all because we can see that the 
escalation of violence is continuing week after week. 
  [Sinclair] Do you mean political dialogue between the 
Algerian authorities and members of the Islamic Salvation Front 
[FIS]? 
  [Juppe] Absolutely, as well as the Algerian factions or the 
political movements who accept dialogue and leave their 
Kalashnikovs behind, including those members of the FIS who 
reject violence. It seems that this discussion process is now 
under way. Unfortunately, violence does not seem to decrease, 
and this is why I am still extremely concerned by the situation 
in Algeria. [passage omitted]

including those who do not have any power. They will have to 
play a role in the country's political future, French 
Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin said. He added that before 
relaunching its cooperation [programs], the international 
community should make sure that any agreement between the 
government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] be a stable one. [passage omitted] 
  The French interior minister wanted to clarify the situation 
about UNITA's friendship with France. It [the friendship] has 
been apparently replaced by state-to-state relations. However, 
the military embargo remains. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos by </F>
correspondent Monique Mas; date and place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Our guest today is Jose Eduardo dos Santos. His 
visit to France was his first trip outside Africa since his 
victory in the September 1992 presidential elections and the 
resumption of the war with UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola]. After the visit was postponed, and in 
spite of the opposition of French supporters of UNITA, the 
Angolan president was met officially in Paris by his 
counterpart, President Francois Mitterrand, and also by Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur and the French ministers of 
cooperation and the interior. This was a form of diplomatic 
recognition for Eduardo dos Santos, but France failed to commit 
itself at any level. Paris has made the resumption of its 
cooperation conditional on a peace agreement, has referred the 
rescheduling of the 1 billion francs owed to it by Angola to the 
IMF, and has upheld its embargo on arms sales. Monique Mas 
began by asking President Dos Santos if he was not disappointed 
by his visit: 
  [Santos] No, we are not disappointed. The most important 
thing for us is that France has a firm position on the current 
problems in Angola. We heard from the French authorities that 
there was a legitimate, elected government in Angola. It is 
with this government that France will maintain relations of 
friendship and cooperation within a relatively privileged 
framework. 
  We view the question of the [arms] embargo within the 
broader 
framework of the United Nations, in light of the resolution 
adopted by the Security Council, whereby the Angolan Government 
is free -- at least until the cease-fire is reimposed in Angola 
-- to reequip itself militarily. France is a permanent member 
of the Security Council, and so I hope that France will apply 
this United Nations resolution. 
  Regarding the resumption of economic cooperation in the 
post-war period, I think that there was considerable interest 
from the French Government in broadening current levels of 
cooperation, so that Angola can enjoy not only the support of 
France, but also that of the international community as a whole. 
The possibility was even raised of organizing an international 
conference on the rehabilitation of Angola. 
  [Mas] On the subject of the international community, the 
United States and Great Britain have lifted the military embargo 
against Angola. How do you explain France's differing position 
on this issue, and do these two countries supply you with 
anything significant in terms of arms? 
  [Santos] It is more a political than a military question. We 
have not asked for arms from either the British, U.S., or French 
Governments, but, as I have stressed, there is a rebellion in 
Angola, the French Government has diplomatic relations with the 
Angolan Government, which it recognizes as a legitimate and 
elected government, so we do not see any reason for an embargo. 
We are sure that the French position on this issue will change. 
  [Mas] With France in a period of cohabitation, have you been 
reassured as to this government's attitude to Angola in contrast 
to that of the previous socialist government? What do you 
expect from France, in particular on the subject of the Lusaka 
talks? 
  [Santos] As I told you, we heard a common position from the 
French authorities regarding the political, military, and even 
economic problems in Angola. We are very satisfied with this 
position. We have asked France to play a role in this region in 
order to establish a regional climate which can accelerate the 
negotiating process in Lusaka. 
  [Mas] What role in particular? 
  [Santos] We would like France to put pressure on all the 
countries in the region that continue to give military aid to 
UNITA, helping it wage war against the democratic institutions. 
  [Mas] Would this be mainly Zaire? 
  [Santos] South Africa -- let us say conservative, radical 
elements in South Africa -- and also Zaire of course. 
  [Mas] The Lusaka talks have touched on political issues. How 
far are you prepared to go in your talks with UNITA? 
  [Santos] Taking account of the basic principle that the 
party 
that won the elections should set up a government and should 
govern, we are prepared to offer portfolios to UNITA, within a 
framework of national reconciliation, just as we have offered 
portfolios to other political parties represented in our 
government. 
  [Mas] What can you offer Mr. Savimbi? 
  [Santos] What UNITA asks for is a special status. The terms 
of this status will be discussed in Lusaka.

  [Text] Federalism and liberalism are the principles which 
inspire the Northern League's manifesto, unveiled today in 
Milan. According to the League, it is necessary to shift the 
emphasis of public spending from current expenditure to 
investment and to reorganize the public sector, cutting state 
support in order to favor private enterprise. 
  The League believes in the complete freedom of local 
authorities to levy their own taxes and be responsible for 
expenditure. Personal and corporate income tax would be reduced. 
Small and medium-sized businesses would be developed by means 
of partnerships, aid to southern Italy would cease, and greater 
flexibility in working hours would be introduced.

  [Text] There are 28 days left until the election and the 
political debate, a task which until now has been entrusted to 
the party leaders, is becoming ever more lively and sharp. 
Marco Fritella reports: 
  [Fritella] Sure -- no, very sure -- of victory, the leaders 
nevertheless continue to argue without even taking a pause. In 
other words there is continual bickering on the Right. We will 
end up like Renzo's capons [as heard], said Pierferdinando 
Casini, leader of the Christian Democrat Center party, inviting 
the parties to call a truce. However, no one is willing. 
Gianfranco Fini, secretary of the National Alliance, said that 
the Northern League will lose votes, in fact it will collapse, 
and after the elections Umberto Bossi would be left holding a 
worse hand than before. Bossi retorted during the presentation 
of the League's manifesto that Fini was and remains a fascist, 
and as for Forza Italia, it is an instrument of the old regime. 
He said that the League had made a pact with Silvio Berlusconi 
only because otherwise the party's vote would have split. 
Raffaele Costa from the Liberal Party observed rather worriedly 
that a little more unity was necessary. 
  The reality is that both the Right and the Left have created 
artificial alliances which will shatter immediately, Giorgio La 
Malfa, secretary of the Republican Party, maintained, weighing 
in for the center parties. 
  The Left has breathed a sigh of relief at the fact that 
today 
Fausto Bertinotti, secretary of Communist Renewal, said that he 
wanted at all costs to maintain the unity of the progressive 
alignment. It is a pity then that he has different ideas on 
treasury bonds and NATO from the other members of the alignment. 
However, the Right means reaction, Lucio Magri and Armando 
Cossutta, of Communist Renewal, stated, and so it is necessary 
to stick together. 
  And what of Achille Occhetto? Tomorrow he is leaving for 
Brussels and NATO headquarters -- the umbrella which was so 
liked by Enrico Berlinguer [former Communist Party leader].

  [Text] Umberto Bossi, [secretary of the Northern League], 
has started the election campaign in Piacenza today and has 
attacked [Berlusconi's] Forza Italia: "It is the creature of 
the old Christian Democratic Party. We understood that 
immediately and we captured it with the trap of a free-market 
alignment [polo liberista]," he said. He then made a direct 
appeal to voters: Beware, within the freedom alignment [the 
alliance with Berlusconi], there is only one free-market group: 
The League. 
  Bossi made his forecast: In a month's time, the League will 
have 120-150 members of parliament. The first bill we will 
present will be the expropriation of the assets that parties 
gained during Bribe City.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Northern League Chamber of </F>
Deputies floor leader, by "g.p." in Milan; date not given: "`We 
Will Never Join Forces With the Fascists' -- Maroni Wants a 
Ciampi-Style Government"; first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi said: "A 
Forza Italia-League government with external support from 
National Alliance [AN] may be formed." However, relations 
between the Bandwagon [League nickname] and Forza Italia have 
become somewhat tense by now, so Maroni, replied to the Knight's 
[Berlusconi nickname] proposal by suggesting instead "a 
government made up by the League, Forza Italia, CCD [Christian 
Democratic Center], and UCD [Center Union], and with external 
support, not only, however, from AN but from anyone else." 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But in this way you are voiding Berlusconi's 
proposal. 
  [Maroni] The important thing is that Berlusconi said that AN 
will not form part of the government. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] In short, you do not want [AN leader] Fini. 
  [Maroni] As [Northern League Secretary] Bossi says, maybe 
the 
mountains will also move, but, I repeat -- and this is no news 
-- there will be no government with the fascists. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Berlusconi insists on opening a door to 
Fini. 
  [Maroni] We could perhaps make use of those political 
personalities who are elected under Forza Italia and AN's common 
symbol, but who are nevertheless independent. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] They would not be enough to form a 
government. 
  [Maroni] AN has not subscribed to a political agreement or 
to 
a platform. We, Forza Italia, CCD, UCD, the Radicals, and the 
Pact's former supporters, have done so, and this constitutes the 
future government's platform. Forza Italia and AN only add up 
to votes, as Berlusconi himself says. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] To set up that sort of government you would 
require an absolute majority without AN. 
  [Maroni] Why place limits to Providence? 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] If, as is more probable, you do not obtain 
that majority, Fini's votes will be decisive. 
  [Maroni] We will form a minority government. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What if Berlusconi insists? 
  [Maroni] How could he govern without the League's votes? 
Presumably, with Fini and the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left], given that [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian 
Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli will not have a seat. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] With a minority government... 
  [Maroni] Yes. Consider the Ciampi government. It did not 
have a majority but, in our opinion and in that of many others, 
it governed well. Consider the Varese and Monza town councils, 
with League mayors but no organized majorities. They are doing 
very well. Otherwise, new elections would have to be held all 
the time. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] No alternatives? 
  [Maroni] There is also another possible government solution, 
which has been proposed to me by a PDS member in the last few 
days: that of an institutional government. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Who made this proposal? 
  [Maroni] I cannot tell you, but it is someone I hold in high 
esteem. An institutional government would have to include 
everybody, from Communist Renewal to AN, and it would have to be 
based on a very precisely defined platform, limited to a few 
points only: electoral reform, institutional reform; this would 
be followed by elections.

  [Text] [Announcer] Let us now see what Occhetto [Democratic 
Party of the Left, PDS, secretary] thinks about the next 
government. Attilio Romita reports: 
  [Romita] Occhetto gave no formula for a postelection 
government. On the other hand, he put forward the idea of a 
national democratic government of reconstruction. 
  This is one of the PDS's three goals. Beating the right is 
the first and main goal. The right, according to Occhetto, is 
becoming aggressive again. There is a risk that the worst 
fascist culture may reemerge. The first goal comes in the form 
of an appeal made by Occhetto to the progressives: to fight for 
security, stability, and national solidarity. This is why the 
PDS leader warned everyone against the climate of fighting, 
division, and hatred which may become prevalent among Italians. 
These were the main things Occhetto said at the opening of the 
election campaign. He could not speak loudly: he had very 
little voice left after his trip to London.

it is where a great, new, scientific machine -- the sincrotrone 
[as heard] -- has been unveiled. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi chose its 
inauguration to make an upbeat statement. 
  Just as the chaos surrounding the forthcoming elections 
seems 
to have reached its zenith, the prime minister has said that he 
has no doubts that the machinery has been set in motion and 
rather than giving up, Italy is on the path to recovery. 
  According to Ciampi the first signs of the recovery can 
already be seen: 
  [Begin Ciampi recording] What is certain is that the worst 
of the recession is behind us. There can be no doubts about 
this in Italy. Nor should the widespread uncertainty about the 
elections be mistaken for chaos -- it is an essential part of 
all true democracies. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "From Ciampi to Occhetto: Everyone </F>
is in Favor"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Reactions to the agreement reached on Monday 
night [21 February] between the trade unions, Fiat, and Labor 
Minister Gino Giugni were characterized by a decidedly positive 
tone. For CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] 
Secretary Bruno Trentin, "the Fiat agreement constitutes the 
best which could be achieved, in a situation which is both so 
serious and so full of unknowns, in particular after obtaining, 
at the last moment, the government's formal involvement in an 
extraordinary audit of the company's commitments." However, 
Trentin's reaction is offset by that of the Essere trade union 
in the CGIL which, in a memorandum, contests the agreement. 
  A comment on the solution of the Fiat dispute also came from 
Democratic Party of the Left leader Achille Occhetto, for whom 
"the FIOM [Federation of Employees and Workers in the 
Metallurgical Industry] did a good thing in signing the 
agreement." "The FIOM," he added "has arrived at a new and 
significant position on the question of industrial policies, 
which demonstrates how the real problem today is that of having 
a government and a majority which can have this agreement 
applied as it relates to employment prospects." Prime Minister 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who intervened directly on Monday to 
support a positive outcome of the agreement, yesterday expressed 
to Giugni "the government's appreciation for the intelligent 
work of mediation and for achieving the very important agreement 
in the Fiat dispute." 
  For CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] Deputy 
Secretary General Raffaele Morese, "this is a victory for worker 
participation." "The agreement reflects," he added, "a fair 
amount of the CISL's philosophy." However, for former CISL 
General Secretary Pierre Carniti, the agreement "is a good 
thing, but the early retirements are the most senseless and 
expensive of all the social shock absorbers." 
  Satisfaction was also expressed by Confindustria [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry] Chairman Luigi Abete. Abete 
described the accord as "a very important result, which 
demonstrates that when the institutions on the one hand and the 
competent social partners on the other hand are allowed to work 
calmly, it is possible to find balanced solutions which address 
labor's problems, but which also give major consideration to 
problems of competitiveness."

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Petrini: "Italy Back on Track -- </F>
Recovery on Its Way"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The economy is in recovery. At least, this 
is what is indicated by the initial data on industrial 
production, which rose 6 percent last December compared to the 
same month in 1992. This is the first positive result since 
June 1992, apart from last August's result, which was highly 
influenced by seasonal data. This good news is, nevertheless, 
accompanied by the less tempting news on the public deficit: 
There is talk of a 8 trillion lire hole in the this year's 
public accounts. Yesterday, Treasury Undersecretary Sergio 
Coloni explained that a minibudget would be "inevitable," even 
if Filippo Cavazzuti (of the Democratic Party of the Left, 
[PDS]) poured oil on his own troubled waters, recalling the 
positive effect that might result from the recovery. 
  So the driving forces behind industry are firing up again, 
and this time it looks like they mean business. The data was 
disseminated yesterday by ISTAT [Central Statistics Institute], 
the national statistics office: Industrial production last 
December, i.e., less than two months ago, rose 6 percent in one 
year. This is a spectacular reversal of the trend if one simply 
recalls that the production figures have been continually 
negative since June 1992 -- more than a year and a half ago. 
Not even the fact that in December 1993 there was one more day 
of work than in December 1992 was enough to put this into 
perspective: At ISTAT they explained that the data, which have 
been adjusted to account for the extra day of work, remain 
positive and point to a nice rise of 2.2 percent. 
  It is hard to figure out whether this is a weak or temporary 
recovery, or a definitive revival. The pessimists are not 
lowering their guard: They point out that these data are 
comparable to those from late 1992, a disastrous period for our 
economy. They add that businesses have not been overrun by 
renewed and urgent demand, but are merely restoring their 
inventories, that it is still exports which bring in the orders, 
and that domestic demand -- even if it is peeping out here and 
there -- is still in a deep and troubled sleep. 
  Yet something is moving. Judging by the data from 
Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], which 
arrived in late February of this year and which mentioned a 
growth in production of 2 percent during the first two months of 
1993, Italy should be on the point of chalking up a third 
consecutive quarter of growth. That would suffice to say that 
the worst is over and that the recovery is under way. 
  In its official statement, ISTAT mentioned "signs of a 
slowdown in the negative trend" up until last August. The 
institute's director, Paolo Garonna, spoke yesterday of an 
"important sign." Meanwhile, Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi recently told EC Commission President Jacques Delors that 
reportedly there were "some signs of a turnaround in the trend" 
and that "the Italian economy is in a position to be among the 
first to benefit from the recovery." The figures bear him out: 
in its semiannual report, ISCO [National Institute for the 
Study of the Economic Situation], a research institute at the 
Budget Ministry, spoke bluntly of recovery and growth in the 
gross domestic product of 1.3 percent for this year. 
  However, apart from the export drive, another decisive 
factor 
will be the progress of domestic consumption, which is the 
driving force in economic recovery. Last year, internal 
consumption collapsed in Italy for the first time since the war. 
  So will Italians once again start dipping into their 
wallets? 
The sectors which ISTAT places in the front ranks when assessing 
the December data are almost all export-oriented, but signs of 
an internal recovery are also emerging in places: packaging, 
small tools, shoes and purses, bottles and plastic packages, 
office machines, and knitwear have shown signs of a strong 
recovery. In major productive sectors, there is less anxiety. 
At Federtessili [Italian Federation of Textile Workers Unions], 
there is a certain amount of optimism. "There has been a 
turnaround since late last year," they say, "but for the time 
being we can only talk of stabilizing production activity." 
Unionplast, an association of producers of plastic articles, 
has just calculated the data for its sales in 1993: They rose 3 
percent. "We are also feeling a bit of recovery in domestic 
demand," Director Amilcare Bozzini noted, "but it is primarily 
exports to the United States and Germany that are going strong. 
At Federmeccanica [Metal Workers and Mechanics Union 
Federation] they are keen to point out that the metal and 
mechanical industry is doing badly, but the metal products 
sector has been recovering since late November. There is also 
caution in the paper, printing, and publishing sector: 
Newspapers and books are not taking off and only packing boxes 
used for export goods are pulling the sector along." 
  Will that suffice for the recovery? Working against it, 
however, are the employment figure and the crisis in the major 
industrial sectors, such as automobiles, where growth is 
negative.

  [Excerpt] The accession of Austria, Norway, Sweden, and 
Finland to the European Union [EU] must be decided today. More 
details from Brussels from Fernando Paula Brito: 
  [Brito] The EU is preparing a final response, which will be 
handed to the four candidates this afternoon. Foreign Minister 
Durao Barroso is confident that a solution will be found for 
some of them. Norway continues to be one of the most 
problematic cases: 
  [Begin recording] [Barroso] I believe Norway has not shown 
enough flexibility yet. We and many others cannot accept their 
negotiating stands. I believe that is the most problematic case 
in these negotiations although there are other issues to be 
resolved with some of the candidates. 
  [Correspondent] But is Norway not wanting to limit access to 
its territorial waters somehow for the same reasons Portugal 
limits access by community vessels to Madeiran and Azorean 
territorial waters? 
  [Barroso] Yes, but we accept the principle of restricted 
access. What we cannot accept is a member state refusing 
categorically -- such in the case of Norway -- refusing to share 
its resources in any way. We also share some of our resources.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Luisa Arrozarena in Tenerife] </F>
  [Text] Portuguese President Mario Soares spoke about the 
European Union [EU], the enlargement of the EU, today in Spain. 
He also called for democratic countries to be responsible when 
it comes to the creation and promotion of conditions which allow 
the birth of new democracies based on clean elections. Soares 
commented on the forthcoming elections in the Middle East, 
Mozambique, and South Africa, among others. In La Laguna, 
Tenerife, today, Soares was opening a conference on free 
elections and international observation of elections. Soares 
also noted the Suzuki-Santana Motor case in Linares during his 
speech. The Portuguese president said that he supported the 
presence of multinationals as long as they are held under 
control. Regarding the expansion of the EU Soares said that he 
approved the entry of the four countries still waiting to become 
members of the EU. Maria Luisa Arrozarena reports: 
  [Arrozarena] President Mario Soares, speaking in Tenerife at 
La Laguna univeristy, said that he fully supported EU expansion. 
Yes to a community Europe with more countries than at present: 
  [Begin Soares recording] I support a strengthening of 
European institutions; therefore, for European union to progress 
not only as an economic and monetary union but also as a 
political community. In additon, I support the expansion of 
Europe not only to the Nordic countries but to other countries. 
[end recording] 
  [Arrozarena] Soares also spoke about the problems of the 
multinationals which set themselves up in Europe and at a given 
moment decide to leave, such as the case with Suzuki-Santana, 
Volkswagen, etc. The Portuguese president, who announced that 
on Wednesday [23 February] he will have a meeting with Felipe 
Gonzalez and with King Juan Carlos on Thursday, also said that 
in his opinion one should be happy when the multinationals 
arrive but be prepared for when they say that they are going and 
above all, Mario Soares said, multinationals could be controlled 
with a strong EU, with strong European political parties, and 
single unions.

  [Text] Switzerland's defense and foreign ministers have 
come out in support of Swiss participation in peacekeeping 
missions by United Nations blue helmet troops. Kaspar Villiger 
and Flavio Cotti said such participation would be in line with 
Switzerland's tradition of supporting peaceful solutions for 
political conflicts. [Defense Minister] Mr. Villiger, speaking 
ahead of a national vote on the issue in June, said all Swiss 
blue helmet personnel would take part on a purely voluntary 
basis. He said the Swiss contingent would only take part in 
noncombat missions, that all parties in a conflict would have to 
agree to a UN deployment, and that Swiss troops could be 
withdrawn at any time.

  [Text] The Swiss government has launched a campaign to 
persuade voters to back its plans for Swiss participation in 
United Nations peacekeeping missions. It says sending 
peacekeepers would be in line with the national tradition of 
supporting peaceful solutions to political conflicts. A 
nationwide vote on the issue has been called by rightwing 
opponents of the scheme. This report from our parliamentary 
corrrespondent, Pierre Andre Tschanz: 
  [Tschanz] Opponents of Swiss participation, who have now 
collected the 50,000 signatures needed to force a nationwide 
vote, share a very limited view of what neutrality means. As 
they see it, it not only precludes Swiss membership of the 
United Nations, it also prevents Bern sending troops to take 
part in peacekeeping operations. Eight years ago this viewpoint 
was still prevalent in Switzerland. Three out of four voters 
said "No" to joining the UN in a nationwide vote. This time, 
though, the government is not letting the grass grow under its 
feet, hence the launch of a publicity offensive two and half 
months before the vote. 
  Its argument is simple: Switzerland has always done its best 
to contribute to peace and security worldwide. It has done so 
by sending mediators and observers to conflict zones and by 
offering financial support and personnel. 
  For Mr. Cotti [president], sending peacekeeping troops to 
such areas is a logical continuation of traditional policy. Mr. 
Villiger [defense minister] puts it even more bluntly -- for 
him, not to do so would risk endangering the credibility of the 
government's foreign and security policy. 
  What is more, says the government, there's no real conflict 
between participating in such missions and maintaining Swiss 
neutrality. Swiss troops would not be taking part in what is 
termed peace enforcement. Participation would be limited to 
peacekeeping missions which have been approved by all parties to 
the conflict. And the government would always be free to choose 
on a case by case basis which operations it takes part in. If 
the nature of the mission changed during its course, troops 
could be withdrawn at any stage. To take a practical example, 
Switzerland would not send troops to areas such as Somalia or 
Sarajevo. 
  The government, it's plain to see, is doing its best to 
reassure nervous voters. It has two and half months to succeed.

Haavisto, has deplored the massacre of Muslim worshippers in 
Hebron in the occupied West Bank. 
  In a statement issued on Friday [25 February], Foreign 
Minister Haavisto called the massacre a shocking act and 
expressed the hope that the act of violence would not endanger 
the Middle East peace process. He said that Finland expressed 
its deep condolences for the loss suffered by the Palestinians. 
Mr. Haavisto also said that he joins in the widespread hope 
that the shocking act will not encumber the peace process or the

Popular"] 
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party's support is now clearly 
larger than in the parliamentary election of 1991. Conversely, 
the Swedish People's Party has not been able to draw any 
advantage from the popularity of presidential candidate 
Elisabeth Rehn. This is seen from one of the polls that the 
Finnish Broadcasting Company released on Wednesday [9 February]. 
  The Social Democratic Party is now supported by 32.5 percent 
of eligible voters, compared with 22 percent in the 
parliamentary election three years ago. Support for both the 
Center and Conservative Parties is now put at 17.5 percent. In 
1991 almost 25 percent voted for the Center Party and over 19 
percent for the Conservatives. The survey was done by 
Taloustutkimous [marketing research firm] in January-February. A 
total of 1,900 citizens were asked their opinion.

<F P=106> ["j-ae" report: "Is the EU Trying To `Divide And Rule' </F>
Regional Support Offer Tailor-Made for Sweden"] 
  [Text] The way in which the European Union [EU] has shaped 
its new regional policy support offer to the applicant nations 
gave rise yesterday to assessments that on the eve of the 
decisive phases in the negotiations the EU is trying to split 
the Nordic front. The offer was clearly welcome in Sweden, 
while Finland and Norway were clearly less delighted. 
  Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto received a question about 
this after he and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen 
yesterday briefed the Eduskunta Foreign Affairs Committee on the 
situation in the negotiations. He did not exactly make an 
effort to dismiss the "divide and rule" theory. 
  "The EU is a very skillful negotiator that exploits all the 
factors it can make use of...." 
  Haavisto pointed out that the new EU offer is very different 
from the views that the EU Commission has expressed in the past. 
"The offer takes Sweden's special needs into consideration to an 
exceptionally high degree," he said. 
  On the other hand Haavisto said that he does not think that 
there "really exists any Nordic front." The reports of Nordic 
cooperation on agricultural questions only mean that people have 
backed the idea that each individual country's agreement will 
build on the same components and be drafted in such a way that 
it does not cause difficulties for any other applicant. These 
components are the EU's own support arrangements, the 
much-desired special Nordic support, and environmental support. 
The foreign minister still believes that the EU is striving for 
"parallel solutions" on agriculture in the case of all the 
Nordic countries. 
  And even if the EU were trying intentionally to split the 
Nordic front, Haavisto does not think that it is possible to 
draw from this the conclusion that Sweden is being given 
priority over Finland and Norway as a potential EU member. All 
three countries are probably seen as attractive in this context. 
  As far as regional support is concerned, Haavisto said that 
Finland still has the central goal of achieving regional support 
under the Objective 1 classification. However, the new 
Objective 6 model can clearly been discussed if it is possible 
to "extend the regions covered in the same way that Sweden has 
been allowed to do." 
  Thus the minimum demand is that Finland must be given 
regional support that is as favorable as that which Sweden has 
received. 
  According to reports, the ministers' main message to the 
Foreign Affairs Committee was that a negotiated result can only 
be achieved if the national leaderships of the 12 EU countries 
now take an active part in the negotiations and give their 
negotiators orders to strive in earnest for results. Foreign 
Minister Haavisto described Finland's room for maneuver as 
limited. 
  The committee members contented themselves with asking 
questions of the of the ministers and Foreign Ministry 
officials; according to reports, there was no suggestion of 
giving the negotiators orders. 
  Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen, who himself 
is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said after the 
meeting with the ministers that Finland cannot count on pushing 
through all its demands on all the difficult issues. 
Nevertheless he is expecting that it will be possible to 
achieve a result in the negotiations. 
  According to Lipponen, the government's list of priorities 
with regard to agriculture -- first an agreement on so-called 
northern support, then the transitional arrangements, and then 
production quotas -- is the right one, but it will probably be 
necessary to compromise on all these points. Lipponen said that 
the new regional support that has been offered "is not 
necessarily impossible for Finland if it is possible to have it 
adjusted." In his view it is also possible for Finland to make 
an immediate transition to EU price levels. However, this would 
presuppose financial support for Finnish agriculture for a 
transitional period. 
  Lipponen seemed fairly satisfied with the information he had 
received. However, he said it was sometimes difficult to know 
whether it was the foreign minister or the chairman of the 
Central Association of Agricultural Producers [Haavisto's former 
position] who was speaking....

<F P=106> [Article by Patricia Winckelmann-Zilliacus: "Labor Minister </F>
Irritated Over Charges of Passivity"] 
  [Text] The goals for government job programs this year is 
to end unemployment for a total of 300,000 of the unemployed. In 
itself this figure does not contain much that is new, since in 
1993 almost as many people were put to work through support 
measures or received job training. 
  Government officials responsible for labor market programs 
are angry at being charged with not doing anything to combat 
mass unemployment. In connection with providing information on 
two new job-creation measures, the [Labor] Ministry took the 
opportunity to more generally report on what is being done and 
what goals are being striven for in the active job-creation 
policy this year. 
  "I venture to assert that unemployment in March or April 
will 
start to decline. Unfortunately, we estimate that the 
unemployment rate for the entire year will be 19 percent. It 
would be important to be able temporarily to end unemployment 
for as many as possible. It is a horrifying thought that at the 
end of the year we will have 200,000 long-term unemployed. The 
primary goal in this year's job creation programs is to end 
youth and long-term unemployment for as many as possible," said 
Labor Minister Ilkka Kanerva in presenting the Labor Ministry's 
goals. 
  There are currently 56,000 individuals who have been put to 
work through some sort of job-creation support. There are 27,000 
unemployed people receiving job training. These measures have 
time deadlines. Most subsidized jobs are for six months; 
training programs are generally four months. The reason for 
these time limits is to reach as many as possible. Those with 
temporary jobs or in training programs are not counted in the 
unemployment statistics. This group usually goes under the 
category of "hidden unemployment." This means that Finland 
actually has closer to 620,000 unemployed (24.5 percent of the 
work force). Sweden, which traditionally has worked very hard on 
an active job-creation policy, has an open unemployment of 8 
percent. If those who are participating in active measure 
programs are included, the Swedish unemployment rate is 14 
percent. 
  "Despite the catastrophically high jobless figures in 
December, there are many indicators that the employment 
situation is about to slowly turn for the better. Unemployment 
lasting durations of less than three months has more or less 
stopped increasing. In December 15,600 unemployed got jobs in 
the normal labor market. This is 43 percent more than in 
December 1992," said Kanerva. 
  He pointed out that job-creation policy cannot perform 
miracles. Above all, it is monetary and fiscal policies that 
most effectively can improve employment. His hope is that the 
Bank of Finland [Central Bank] will consider the exceptionally 
high unemployment when planning strategy dealing with monetary 
policy. Interest rates must be further brought down in order to 
get activity in the domestic market under way. 
  Business employment thresholds must made lower. This means 
that the indirect wage costs, at least for small businesses, 
must be reduced. "Alongside these important economic measures 
the Labor Ministry is trying to end unemployment for almost 
250,000 persons. From 4 to 5 billion markkas have been earmarked 
for job creation in the supplemental budget that will be 
presented in February. Next fall we will concentrate on a job 
creation program for youth that should provide training places 
for 35,000 young people," said Kanerva. 
  The Labor Ministry estimates that unemployment will begin to 
drop by March or April, but it will drop very slowly. Around 
December 1995, it is estimated that unemployment will still be 
around 15 percent. How the level of long-term unemployment will 
be then remains to be seen. Researchers studying unemployment 
are entirely in agreement that a long period of high open 
joblessness leads to permanent unemployment, which takes a high 
toll on society both economically and socially. Denmark, whose 
economy for the moment is among the best in Europe, is still 
fighting with an unemployment rate of 11 percent. A little over 
300,000 Danes have been without jobs for longer or shorter 
periods.

<F P=106> [Kimmo Salin report: "Ecobus Prototype To Be Released in </F>
March"] 
  [Text] Work on Saab-Valmet's newest project, a small 
ecological bus developed at the company's production facility, 
is progressing. Saab-Valmet CEO Juhani Linnoinen said that the 
finished product will be presented in March. The bus prototype 
from Uusikaupunki has also attracted interest abroad, Linnoinen 
said: "Selling is going to be easier when we can show the 
ready-made product," he added. 
<H5>  Low Effect on Employment </H5>
  Linnoinen does not believe, however, that the bus project 
will solve the employment situation at Saab-Valmet. The 
production of this bus will not have any greater impact on 
manpower requirements, but it will help the plant to keep its 
high technology know-how in house. 
  This project represents an effort by Saab-Valmet to make use 
of technologies from car manufacturing to rationalize the 
production of buses. The product, which is now in its prototype 
phase, is a good example of cooperation within the Finnish 
transport equipment industry. 
  "Our bus has a gas-diesel engine from Valmet and shafting 
from Sisu. We are aiming for a high degree of domestic content, 
about 90 percent." 
<H5>  A New Model Is Still Needed </H5>
  Even with a positive sales launch, the Ecobus does not solve 
Saab-Valmet's problems in its search for a new model to 
complement production of the new Saab 900 convertible and the 
Opel Calibra. 
  Production of the convertible begins next April. The car, 
which took part in automobile exhibitions in Detroit and 
Stockholm, was received favorably, according to Linnoinen. 
  "This year's production volume will depend on how many units 
we can make before the end of the convertible season. We aim to 
maintain at least the same production volume as for the previous 
Saab Cabriolet." 
  Linnoinen mentions that, as of April, the Uusikaupunki plant 
will start producing the Calibra according to the production 
figures laid down in the new agreement. A court of arbitration 
obliged Opel some time ago to transfer 45 percent of production 
of the Calibra back to Uusikaupunki until 1996. GM is expected 
to produce 27,000 Calibra cars this year. 
  GM tried to transfer the entire Calibra production to 
Germany 
on the basis of its claim that the production cost for one 
Calibra was 4,000-5,000 DM [Deutsche marks] higher in 
Uusikaupunki than in Germany. GM would therefore, according to 
this calculation, have to pay $34 million for producing more 
than 12,000 Calibra cars in Uusikaupunki. 
  Linnoinen replied that the result depends on the method of 
calculation, i.e., how the various cost factors are taken into 
account.

<F P=106> [Article by Harald Stanghelle] </F>
  [Text] A slim majority of the voters would say yes to 
Norwegian membership in the EU [European Union] if Finland and 
Sweden join, according to the polling firm Opinion. 
  A poll that Opinion conducted for AFTENPOSTEN confirms the 
impression that the yes side is gaining support. Some 41 percent 
say yes, 39 percent say no, and 19 percent still have not made 
up their minds. This is the first time since the negotiations 
started between Norway and the EU that there is a majority in 
favor. In January 36 percent said yes and 42 percent said no 
when we asked the voters their opinion on Norwegian EU 
membership if our two Nordic neighbors were members. 
  Several polls this month show that the yes side has been 
strengthened at the expense of the no side. Opinion's February 
poll shows that 37 percent of the voters now say yes to EU 
membership unconditionally. A full 48 percent say no, however, 
and 15 percent have not decided. So there can be no doubt that 
the no side continues to have the upper hand, even though there 
has been migration within the electorate in the last two months. 
The yes side has advanced by 11 percent since December in 
Opinion's polls, and the no side has declined by 6 percent. 
Another fact is that the yes side has become more convinced. The 
yes alternative "definitely yes" was chosen by 10 percent more 
supporters in February than in December. 
<H5>  Negotiations </H5>
  One important factor in the trends that this and other polls 
show may be the strong focus on Norway's negotiations with the 
EU. The negotiations have led to the issue becoming more 
imminent, and at the same time the main point of the no side's 
argument is overshadowed by the tug-of-war going on in Brussels. 
Another reason the voters are confident that the government is 
protecting Norwegian interests may be the impression created by 
what former Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen termed 
"rigid Norwegian positions." 
  According to Opinion's poll there can be little doubt that 
the outcome of the negotiations is important to the voters' 
stance on the EU. When we asked, What importance do you ascribe 
to the outcome of the negotiations in your vote on Norwegian EU 
membership? 54 percent said "great" (28 percent) or "some" (26 
percent) importance. 
  The figures also show that a full 58 percent of the 
undecided 
voters ascribe great importance (40 percent) or some importance 
(18 percent) to the negotiation outcome in determining their 
final position. 
  The outcome of the negotiations has the greatest 
significance 
for Labor Party voters: A full 66 percent say it is of 
importance to their view on the EU issue. Only 31 percent of the 
Progress Party's voters say the same thing, while the other 
parties go from 45 percent (Center Party) to 52 percent 
(Christian People's Party). 
  We find some of the same trends in the underlying data in 
the 
question that links Finnish and Swedish EU membership to the 
Norwegian voters' position. Of the Labor Party's voters, a full 
58 percent say yes provided our neighboring countries are 
members, and 28 percent say no. If we consider the decidedly 
no-leaning Socialist Left Party, 15 percent say yes, and 70 
percent say no under the same conditions. The corresponding 
figures for the Christian People's Party are 18 and 70. The 
background data support the impression that the Center Party is 
the purest no party. Even if Sweden and Finland become members, 
only 3 percent of the Center Party's voters will say yes to the 
EU, 88 percent continue to say no, and the rest are undecided. 
  Today's poll has two other features worth noting: When the 
yes percent rises, the disparity between opinions among voters 
in urban and rural areas grows. In the cities there are 41 
percent in favor, while there are only 32 percent in favor in 
the rural areas. Among the rural voters 55 percent say no, while 
the no percentage in the urban areas is 42. 
  Another interesting feature is that increasing numbers of 
Labor voters are saying yes to Norwegian membership. To our 
unconditioned question of EU stance, 53 percent of the Labor 
voters say yes, while 34 percent say no. The Progress Party is 
becoming more of a no party: Fifty percent of the party's voters 
are against Norwegian membership, and 35 percent are for. 
  Opinion's February poll was conducted between Monday [7 
February] and Wednesday of this week. It is based on interviews 
with 1,003 persons. We always caution against placing too much 
importance on a single opinion poll, but several polls in the 
last few weeks show the same trend. There can be no doubt that 
the February poll is a psychological breakthrough for the yes 
side. It is the first time in a long time that a poll shows a 
majority in favor of membership under conditions that are 
central to the arguments of the yes side. The belief that 
nothing can change the Norwegian people's opposition to the EU 
has suffered a blow. 
  Paradoxically, this poll could also have a positive effect 
for the no side whose leaders have had trouble keeping their 
followers from assuming victory in advance. 
  EU Membership if Sweden and Finland Are Members: Yes: 41, 
No: 
39, Undecided: 19 percent. 
  Importance of Negotiation Outcome: Great: 28, Some: 26, 
Little or None: 38, Undecided: 8 percent. 
<H5>  Good for Prices, Not for Welfare </H5>
  Norwegian EU membership would be good for prices, defense, 
security, and the environment, but a drawback for jobs, welfare 
institutions, the districts, agriculture, and fisheries. 
  This is how the voters respond in an extensive poll on how 
Norwegians believe EU membership would affect important issues. 
Opinion has conducted the poll for AFTENPOSTEN. 
  The voters do not believe that Norwegian membership in the 
EU 
would have any overall effect on their own financial situation. 
Some 15 percent think membership would be an advantage, 14 
percent a drawback, and a full 56 percent believe Norwegian 
membership is irrelevant to their own financial situation. 
  In spite of this, the voters have very clear opinions on 
what 
membership will mean for important, much-discussed issues. It is 
interesting to note that the assessments do not automatically 
coincide with each individual's standpoint on the EU. 
  All of 57 percent think membership would be an advantage for 
price levels in Norway. Only 11 percent think it would be a 
drawback. We get the same clear-cut response to such issues as 
agriculture, districts policy, and fisheries. Only a minority of 
the voters, even among those who favor membership, think that 
membership is advantageous in these areas. 
  What is interesting is that as many as 35 percent of the 
voters think that EU membership will be disadvantageous to 
employment, while only 19 percent think it will be advantageous. 
These responses have to be viewed in the context of the notion 
of welfare institutions: Some 40 percent of those interviewed 
think EU membership would be a drawback to the Norwegian welfare 
institutions. Only 11 percent think membership would be an 
advantage in this area. In these two very significant areas 
Norwegian voters believe that EU membership will lead to decline 
in comparison with today's conditions in Norway. 
  It would appear that the so-called Zhirinovskiy effect is 
present when a full 39 percent believe that EU membership would 
be an advantage in terms of Norway's defense and security 
position. If we are to believe the figures of this poll, an even 
closer relationship with our allies seems reassuring. It is also 
worth noting that while such groups as Norwegian Environmental 
Protection Association is strongly opposed to EU membership, 32 
percent believe it would be good for environmental efforts if 
Norway joins the EU, while 27 percent do not.

<F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "EU Shifting on Food Prices"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- Norway is beginning to win sympathy in 
the EU [European Union] for its demand to be allowed not to 
adjust its sky-high food prices to the EU's much lower levels 
overnight. According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, a growing 
number of EU countries are beginning to realize that it will be 
necessary to grant Norway and Finland a transitional period. 
  It has long been known that Germany and Britain have 
disagreed with the EU Commission's proposal to demand immediate 
price harmonization. In the internal discussions currently 
taking place nonstop in the EU in an attempt to reach a common 
position, other countries have backed the German and British 
views. "I expect that the EU will offer Norway a transitional 
period," a well-informed EU source told AFTENPOSTEN. 
  Despite the fact that a transitional period for price 
harmonization has been the practice in earlier expansions of the 
EU, this time the Commission has, out of regard for the EU's 
single internal market, consistently opposed acceptance of 
gradual harmonization. Norway and Finland -- the two applicant 
countries with a much high level of prices -- have been just as 
consistent in their refusal to agree to any other solution. If 
the EU now gives way to their demands, this would immediately 
increase the chances of the two sides being able to reach an 
agreement on agriculture at the weekend. 
  The main reason why the EU is in the process of reversing 
its 
position is that it quite simply will too expensive to demand 
immediate price harmonization. The EU knows that the applicants 
refuse to cover farmers' loss of income, and calculations 
indicate that the bill in the first year alone will be between 
16 and 20 billion kroner. If the EU were to go along with the 
Commission's demand and itself pay all or part of the bill, this 
would mean expenditure that the majority of EU countries have no 
desire to meet. A gradual harmonization is expected to cost a 
mere 4 billion kroner in compensation. 
  On the fisheries front too there are signs of hope for 
Norway 
on one of its main demands -- that of duty-free access to the EU 
market for fish and fish products from day one of membership. 
The mood in the EU points to the possibility that this demand 
will be met on certain conditions. One such condition is that 
Norwegian exports should initially be kept at the level they 
have traditionally had, and that an oversight mechanism is set 
up so that it will be possible to intervene if the market is 
flooded with Norwegian fish with major falls in prices as a 
result. It is being said that Norway is also assumed to be 
interested in such a solution. 
  The large quota demands from Spain remain the most important 
problem in the negotiations. Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. 
Olsen was in Paris yesterday to discuss the fisheries demands 
and today meets German Foreign Ministry Under Secretary of State 
Juergen Trumpf in Brussels. Germany is openly irritated at 
Spain and is expected to respond sympathetically to Olsen's 
famous statement to the effect that Norway does not have a 
single fish to give away. 
  The solution that is now on the cards is that Norway will 
use 
the quotas that Spain and other EU countries have been granted 
under the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement as a means of 
applying pressure. The Norwegian position is that these quotas 
will disappear if Norway leaves the EEA to take up EU 
membership. Spain's demand has its point of departure in the EEA 
fisheries agreement -- something that Norway deems to be legally 
untenable.

<F P=106> [Article by Per Nordrum: "A Difficult Negotiation Day With </F>
the EU"] 
  [Text] There was some tough jostling for position in the EU 
[European Union] negotiations yesterday. While no real progress 
was made, there was evidence of a final burst of speed down the 
homestretch. 
  "Now we are starting to move! It has taken a long time to 
obtain the EU's feedback on agriculture, for one thing. Now we 
know a little bit more about its negotiating positions, 
although, in the case of agriculture, it is couched in very 
general terms. Still, the EU understands the need for having 
northern agriculture and for transitional arrangements. What 
form these arrangements will take is something we must tackle in 
the upcoming negotiations," said Trade Minister Grete Knudsen 
after her maiden speech yesterday at the EU in Brussels. 
  Nothing new emerged from the positions meeting yesterday. 
Conventional Norwegian arguments on behalf of our agriculture 
and foodstuffs industry were repeated. In contrast to the Finns 
and the Swedes, the Norwegian team has put the best possible 
interpretation on the EU positions. 
  "What we got today were positions that make it possible for 
us to begin in much greater earnest to respond to this portion 
of the negotiations. But it could also be that I approach this 
with a feminine cunning the others lack," said the trade 
minister. 
  Knudsen was even able to find loopholes that would make it 
possible to evade EU farm prices in Norway from day one of 
membership, a circumstance that Norway has rejected as wholly 
unacceptable. Knudsen saw the potential for a gradual, product 
by product reduction of import protections. 
<H5>  Nothing Is Forever </H5>
  "A loophole for avoiding price adaptations? That is possibly 
Norway's opinion, but within the EU there is not a vestige of 
doubt that we require full compliance on price adaptations from 
day one," said Theodoros Pangalos, the EU Council chairman and 
Greece's European minister. But he added philosophically: 
"Nothing in life is forever. There is no final `yes' or `no.' We 
have only begun the negotiations." 
  "We are determined to keep to the schedule and work hard in 
the coming weeks," said Knudsen. "To emphasize crisis at this 
stage would not be very wise." 
  On 17 February, Norway and the other candidate countries -- 
Sweden, Finland, and Austria -- will meet for deliberation in 
Oslo before the next ministerial round with the EU in Brussels 
on 21 and 22 February. Then there will be some tough, realistic 
negotiations that will go directly into an uninterrupted "final 
push" beginning on Friday, 25 February. 
<H5>  District Policy </H5>
  An internal EU conflict over what Norway and Finland should 
be offered in terms of district policy for their northern 
districts was responsible for the fact that the EU did not have 
any negotiation posture ready for presentation yesterday. A long 
night of tug-of-war led to a statement in which the EU nations 
attempted unsuccessfully to camouflage their discord. The 
disagreement is chiefly due to the fact that Spain feels that 
Norway and Finland have been offered too much in the EU 
negotiation draft paper. Norway will not be treated any less 
well than the EU nations themselves have been treated, the 
statement said. 
<H5>  Intense Annoyance </H5>
  Yesterday's negotiations left the Finns fuming with 
annoyance. The Swedes also employed very tough, precise language 
with the EU ministers. Austria hewed more to the Norwegian 
position and said that they were optimists. But in head-to-head 
conversation with colleagues from other applicant nations their 
tone was quite different. 
  A source in the Swedish negotiations delegation remarked 
that 
"this is serious" after the EU had rejected Norrbotten as a 
"target one area" in district policy terms. The hope is that the 
EU can consent to the evaluation of other criteria besides just 
the level of income. 
<H5>  "Deeply Concerned" </H5>
  "We are deeply concerned about the EU's negotiation posture 
on agriculture," said Heikko Haavisto, Finland's foreign affairs 
minister. The Finns did not receive an offer of a permanent 
price support arrangement for agriculture, despite their efforts 
to get it. Both the Finnish and Swedish team admitted that time 
is beginning to run out, as 1 March is the target date for 
ending the negotiations. Norway is in a worse position than the 
other applicant nations and in the corridors of the EU, the talk 
is increasingly that "the three" -- and that does not include 
Norway -- may conceivably meet the deadline.

<F P=106> [Narendra Taneja report: "Volvo Explores Market in India"] </F>
  [Text] Volvo has begun to explore its possibilities in 
India, one of the fastest growing markets in Asia. Top brass 
from Volvo are visiting India from 14 to 17 February in order to 
become familiar with the market and study business opportunities 
in the country. 
  The delegation is led by Nils Arthur, deputy managing 
director of Volvo's Truck International Division. 
  According to an Indian Industry Ministry spokesman, Volvo is 
to study all important areas, from the possibility of 
co-ownership of enterprises to component purchases in the 
country. 
  India has recently opened up the automobile sector to 
foreign 
investors, who can start production without the prior permission 
from the government required in the past. Although the import 
of foreign cars is still limited, it has become easier to get 
lower customs duty rates. 
<H5>  Mercedes Is Already Here </H5>
  So far only Daimler-Benz has begun the assembly of Mercedes 
automobiles at the Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company 
(TELCO) in Pune near Bombay. 
  Manufacturers assessing the studying opportunities offered 
by 
this new market include BMW, General Motors, Renault, Peugeot, 
and Honda. Volvo is represented in India by Modi Motors Private 
Limited.

  [Text] Reports from New York note that a new team of UN 
experts will come to Cyprus next week to contribute to the 
process of the proximity talks. According to our correspondent 
in New York, Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, has asked for the team. The team 
which will depart Monday [28 February], comprises one legal 
adviser and one official on issues of public administration. A 
third expert from the International Civil Aviation Organization 
will come to Cyprus later. 
  Our correspondent reports that the duties of the three 
experts will be to assist Feissel with the technical details of 
the various aspects of the confidence-building measures. The 
legal adviser will basically assist with the terminology of the 
text of agreement. The work of the official in charge of public 
administration issues is related to the planning of the 
organizational structure of the UN administration of the fenced 
area of Famagusta and Nicosia Airport. The third expert's duties 
are related with the operation of Nicosia International Airport, 
flight control and other related issues. 
  Our correspondent reports that the experts will not prepare 
new reports, nor does their presence mean there will be an 
effort to change the reports prepared by the two teams of 
experts for Famagusta and Nicosia Airport. 
  Our correspondent also reports that another UN expert, Peter 
Taylor, will leave for Cyprus Monday.

<F P=106> [Report by Khr. Andoniadhou] </F>
  [Text] The red dollars that were illegally exported from 
the former Soviet Union have found shelter in European Union 
[EU] and Swiss banks. These funds, estimated at around billions 
of dollars, leave Russia on a daily basis with Cyprus as the 
intermediate destination. 
  Much of the funds remain in banks set up in Cyprus with 
Russian capital or in offshore companies' accounts. But most of 
the funds find shelter in European banks. 
  There is an organized system in the movement of funds that 
are now in the hands of the former nomenclature of the Soviet 
Union. There is a ring of former communists and bank and 
enterprise directors in which government officials are also 
involved. Following the downfall of communism, this ring took 
possession of huge funds belonging to the state and is now using 
various methods to take them to the West. 
  It is estimated, but without Central Bank of Cyprus 
confirmation, that funds worth millions of dollars remain in 
Cyprus. Cyprus has been chosen by this ring due to the 
incentives offered in the form of reduced taxation. According 
to official estimates, there are 2,000 offshore companies in 
Cyprus today belonging to Russians. Among them are eight Russian 
banks. The registration of Russian companies is increasing 
rapidly every day following efforts by the Cypriot and Russian 
Governments to expand their economic and trade relations and 
develop commerce and tourism. 
  Cyprus and Russia signed an agreement for the mutual 
promotion and protection of investments in Moscow last Thursday. 
Based on this agreement, the two countries will be obliged to 
protect each other's investments.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The New American Intervention"] </F>
  [Text] There is general relief when the American factor 
intervenes decisively, presenting ideas to prevent an impasse in 
the talks on the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. That's 
because this intervention shows determination to promote the UN 
process, which is enforced with the joint call issued by the 
United States and Russia to the two sides to show "political 
will and realism for agreement on the CBM's." 
  U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher rejected the evaluation that 
there is an impasse in the talks on the CBM's, stressing that 
things are not idle but that "much work is being done." 
  We do not know the content of the American proposals but we 
trust they do not affect the basis of the talks and do not lift 
the security norms that prevent the CBM's from being interpreted 
as a direct or indirect recognition of the pseudostate. The 
United States is the only superpower able, with its interstate 
relations, not to bend the principles of international law and 
not to come into conflict with the UN Security Council 
resolutions. 
  We want to believe that the increased American interest 
stems 
from the possibilities thrown up by some assurances given to 
President Bill Clinton by [Turkish Prime Minister Tansu] Ciller. 
These assurances are now on trial to test their practical 
implementation. 
  This newspaper has repeatedly stressed the importance of 
U.S. 
intervention as the most powerful way out of the stalemate. The 
White House will and determination to promote a just solution is 
known. The road to an agreement cannot be mined with demands 
that would overturn the basic principles and directives of the 
United Nations, certainly not those contained in the Security 
Council resolutions. President Glavkos Kliridhis emphasized 
that the assurance that the discussion of the CBM's take place 
on condition, among other things, that UN Security Council 
Resolution 541, which condemns the declaration of the 
pseudostate, demands its dissolution, and calls on all UN 
members not to recognize it, is effected. The United States has 
repeatedly declared that the status quo in Cyprus is 
"internationally unacceptable." 
  Consequently, both the suggestion of the U.S. ambassador and 
the joint U.S.-Russian call for political will and realism 
cannot imply that our side surpass the security limits described 
in the Security Council's directives for one federated, bizonal 
state with a single international identity and the exclusion of 
any possibility of separation and final division. 
  President Kliridhis has the legal knowledge and political 
wisdom to deal with any instruction in line with the above, 
should any such instruction be expressed by intervention. 
  Our side's political will is proven. The opposite is true of 
the other side, which remains confined to words or appears 
contradictory with specific acts of provocative rejection of the 
international element's instructions. 
  President Kliridhis' statement that no Cyprus solution can 
depend on Turkey's will, but on the will of the Security 
Council, particularly of its permanent members, should be seen 
as an expression of goodwill in response to the joint 
U.S.-Russian call. 
  That's because our side considers that international law and 
order cannot depend on the will of the aggressor, which in our 
case seeks to maintain the faits accomplis of the invasion and 
occupation.

a solution to the Athens-Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] problem can be found. He also said he is 
concerned about the repercussions of the measures adopted by the 
Greek Government. [passage omitted] 
  Van Den Broek said that all problems, including the issue of 
the Greek measures, will be discussed in Brussels and he will 
brief the EU foreign ministers. 
  Referring to the Greek measures, Van Den Broek said the 
Greek 
side's arguments must also be examined and that this issue will 
be discussed in Brussels as soon as Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's message is received. He stressed, however, that 
the solution of this problem will help resolve future tensions. 
  Generally, Van Den Broek said he is grateful for the 
cooperation he found as well as for the willingness to continue 
joint efforts to find a solution. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos 
said that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's letter containing 
the government's political arguments for the measures against 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] was 
sent this afternoon to European Commission President Jacques 
Delors through diplomatic channels. Pangalos added that the 
memorandum with Greece's legal arguments will be submitted to 
the commission when it is completed. 
  Referring to the possibility of legal proceedings against 
Greece, the European Commission press spokesman clarified that 
the Communal Treaty allows this procedure to be speeded up and 
did not rule out that the court may ask for a temporary lifting 
of the Greek measures. 
  Asked by Greek correspondents, Greek European Union [EU] 
Commissioner Ioannis Palaiokrasas said the procedure of an 
appeal against Greece may be avoided. He said: It is not right 
to end up with such developments. Answering another question, 
Palaiokrasas said the commission has procedures for court 
appeals that are not time consuming. 
  Van Den Broek's spokesman today told reporters that Skopje 
accused Greece of closing its borders even to humanitarian aid.

  [Text] Long lines of tanker trucks carrying fuel have 
formed at the Kakavyia border checkpoint with Albania following 
the recent Finance Ministry decision to allow only five tanker 
trucks from Kakavyia and one from the checkpoint at 
Kristallopiyi to enter Albania. The Finance Ministry made its 
decision after the number of tanker trucks crossing the border 
to Albania increased following the adoption of the measures 
against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM]. There are many signs that these trucks used 
Albanian territory as a route to Skopje. According to the 
Finance Ministry decision, Albania's daily fuel needs are fully 
covered by the six tanker trucks that go through every day.

<F P=106> [Article by Yiorgos Kapopoulos: "West and Balkans: </F>
Guarantees of Little 
Significance"] 
  [Excerpts] Beginning with the explosion of Yugoslavia in 
June 1991 to date, the West has proclaimed uniformly that the 
main element of its mediating intervention is the defense of the 
status quo on international borders [passage omitted]. 
  However, recent developments in the conflict over security 
guarantees in East Europe, as well as the Yugoslav crisis permit 
us to reach some conclusions about the relative character of 
U.S. and West European support for a status quo. Clearly by now 
and for the foreseeable future, there are no prospects for a 
trustworthy dissuasive security guarantee by the West for East 
Europe. The vital interests of important West European powers in 
this region are mainly defined by the attempt to minimize the 
repercussions of social and nationalist conflicts--the principal 
concern being how to avoid a wave of refugees and 
immigrants--rather than by the preservation of the order that 
prevailed after 1945. 
  The statements made last week by U.S. State Department 
officials and by German Chancellor Kohl, regarding the 
prohibitive costs of a military intervention in Bosnia, shed 
light on the limits of the West's trustworthiness in 
guaranteeing stability in East Europe. 
  Throughout the 19th century and the period between the two 
world wars, the status quo and its preservation were part of the 
balance of power system. Today, the common denominator of the 
goals of the main Western powers in East Europe and the Balkans 
is the attempt to minimize the repercussions of a long-lasting 
destabilizing situation. 
  In light of the above, the West's real security policy in 
East Europe and the Balkans seems to be the handling of a 
troublesome change in the postwar order of things at the least 
possible cost. This development is of the utmost importance to 
Greece, a country that links its vital interests with the 
defense of the present order of things in the Balkans. Close to 
our northern border and centering on the fragile Skopje 
republic, there are foci of crisis that can threaten the status 
quo of international borders at any moment. Under present 
conditions, the probability of a decisive preventive and 
stabilizing diplomatic intervention by the West in Kosovo or in 
Skopje aimed at a political settlement of the problems of the 
Albanian-speaking population must be excluded. The West's 
intervention in a potential conflict in the southern area of 
former Yugoslavia will be limited to restraining the expansion 
of an ongoing confrontation that already has abolished the 
present order of things, without the possibility of applying 
pressure for a return to the "status quo ante." 
  Consequently, the statement that Athens is a force in the 
preservation of the status quo in the Balkans is insufficient. 
The United States and West Europe's limited intervention 
capabililities in support of this status quo bring into focus 
the planning of a Greek foreign and defense policy aimed at 
handling the change in the present order of things in the 
Balkans. 
  The fluidity of today's order of things there and the West's 
inability to provide essential guarantees in its support 
militate in favor of a flexible Greek Balkan policy that would 
avoid bilateral obligations and inflexible positions in 
conflicts and arguments that, according to all indications, will 
follow their own course. 
  When, for the umpteenth time, Washington repeats that the 
importance of the Bosnia conflict in its foreign policy ranks 
lower than the Middle East and developments in Russia, it is 
clear that this hierarchization applies to all Balkan conflicts. 
The prohibitive cost of a land intervention in Bosnia will also 
apply to Kosovo and Skopje. 
  Undoubtedly, the emphasis with which Athens--through the 
statements of both the prime minister and the leader of the 
opposition--confirmed its alignment with the policy of the 
United States and of its European Union partners to support the 
Balkan status quo was positive and stabilizing. 
However, this was not sufficient to avoid doubts, and does not 
make the West's verbal guarantees any more credible.

<F P=106> [Article by "The Observer": "Spata-Stamp!"] </F>
  [Excerpts] "Spata-stamp!" The new word coined a few years 
ago, which also means the "bloody extraction" of 5,000 drachmas 
from all passengers using Greek airports. The logic for levying 
this new tax was that its proceeds would finance the 
construction of new airports in Spata and elsewhere. However, as 
is common in our country, voices were raised, protests were 
made, but the "Spata-stamp" became a reality. Passengers no 
longer object--because airlines have dropped their prices in the 
competition war--and someone is collecting the money. 
Additionally, while the funds should have been used for the new 
airport, its construction is still "on paper." Indeed, the 
government is beginning to have second thoughts and is pondering 
whether to renegotiate the contract terms with the present 
bidders, announce a new bidding procedure, or undertake the 
financing itself. [passage omitted] 
  However, today's problem is not the construction of the 
airport, but the fate of the "Spata-stamp" money. The question 
may be naive, for everyone is aware that the budget--or, rather, 
the "Black Hole"--swallows up everything. However, there is a 
small difference in the case of the "Spata-stamp." Who gets its 
proceeds? Is it the government, Olympic Airlines, income tax 
offices, or the Bank of Greece? And if the "Spata-stamp" went to 
cover the "Black Hole" of the budget, Greeks would reluctantly 
accept it, accustomed as they are to special taxes for 
"earthquake victims," the lack of water, or any other reason. 
But if the "Spata-stamp" disappears into the six "holes" of 
Olympic Airlines (read the six circles forming its trademark), 
then things are different, because the state is giving money to 
a bankrupt company; but this is money collected for a specific 
purpose. In plain Greek, a new tax is levied under the pretext 
of financing one project, when in reality it is intended to 
cover the losses of a state company. 
  The futility of the obligation of all Greeks to pay taxes is 
demonstrated once again, since the tax is being diverted into 
something else. Greeks thus become a laughing stock, and 
politicians have the audacity to expect that people will pay 
their taxes. Pray tell us, dear minister of finance, why should 
we pay? To see our money swallowed up into the six holes of 
Olympic Airlines? Or pay for the civil servants who are 
dismissed and immediately rehired by the state? Especially at a 
time when the underground economy--condemned, at least verbally, 
by ministers and politicians alike--is laundering hundreds of 
billions into government bonds which, to make matters worse, are 
untaxed? 
  Don't politicians--regardless of parties--and the mass media 
understand that if the state does not correct itself, stopping 
these games and lies, Greeks will not cease resorting to tax 
evasion? Of course, there are many who snigger because Greeks 
feel "euphoric" when they successfully avoid paying taxes. But 
this is a lucrative game! 
  Unfortunately, though, the issue is not only the 
"Spata-stamp." The minister of energy recently revealed that 
4,326 workers left the Greek Power Corporation (DEl) in the last 
three years, but 11,073 were hired; that is, 6,747 individuals 
were added to the payroll, mainly as "typists," "janitors," and 
"secretaries," at a time when coal mines lack technicians and 
specialized workers. As the minister put it, DEl is now burdened 
with an additional 20 billion drachmas for "redundant" workers. 
And of course, we shall soon be asked to pay higher energy 
prices. 
  Let us hope that the mustachioed individual pretending to be 
a minister and savior of Olympic Airlines decides to inform 
Greek payers of the "Spata-stamp" of where the money is going, 
how much of it there is and which hole is swallowing it.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that Turkey 
insists that the siege in Bosnia-Herzegovina be lifted and the 
six security areas expanded. Cetin also indicated that 
initiatives regarding this issue are under way at the UN 
Security Council. Concluding his two-day official visit to the 
Netherlands, Cetin returned to the country tonight. 
  In a statement he issued at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin 
said that various issues were discussed and assessed with the 
Dutch officials, adding that he believes this visit will 
contribute to further relations between the two countries. 
  Expressing the concern that unless necessary measures are 
taken against the terrorism perpetrated by the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan] organization, terrorism could spread to 
other areas in Europe, Cetin stated that the Dutch authorities 
indicated that they are undertaking great efforts regarding both 
terrorism and xenophobia. 
  Noting that in the course of the meetings he pointed out to 
Turkey's determination to join the Customs Union, Cetin noted 
that for a long time now, the EC had not undertaken any 
financial contributions in that direction. Cetin further 
explained that assessments and discussions were conducted with 
the Dutch authorities on alternate ways and means of obtaining 
financial support for Turkey on its joining the Customs Union, 
since the lack of financial assistance on the part of the EC 
meant that the European Unity was not fulfilling its 
requirements toward Turkey. 
  Cetin also pointed out that during the meetings they 
stressed 
the advantages of the integration of Turks into the Netherlands 
community while retaining their cultural identity.

  [Excerpts] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] has 
approved the recommendation submitted by the Prime Minister's 
Office regarding the extension of the state of emergency, in 
force in the 10 provinces, by another four months as of 19 March. 
  The Assembly convened yesterday evening under the 
chairmanship of Vefa Tanir and discussed the recommendation 
regarding the extension of the state of emergency in force in 
Batman, Bingol, Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, 
Sirnak, Tunceli, and Van. 
  Expressing the views of the government regarding the 
recommendation, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said that the 
state has the right to legally defend itself against those that 
want to attain political gains by means of terrorism. Mentese 
further explained that the state is waging this struggle within 
the framework of international rules. Stressing that the 
terrorist organization is perpetrating ruthless actions in the 
country causing great sorrow to the nation, Mentese remarked: 
Should not everyone be reacting to these actions? All the 
parties, especially those that take advantage of the legal 
system to hide behind these laws, should react to these actions. 
The leader of the party that receives money from the budget 
will probably make fun of this situation [as heard]. Our 
reaction to these actions -- inhuman actions -- is to rise 
against them together and show the necessary rage. 
  Mentese also indicated that the terrorist organization is 
trying to put the pressure on the candidates and the people with 
the approaching regional elections. Explaining that every 
measure possible has been taken in order to avoid this pressure, 
Mentese said that the terrorist organization is showing great 
fear due to the extension of the state of emergency at this 
period when the national conciliation is at its peak. Noting 
that intensive efforts are conducted to eradicate the issue of 
terrorism from the country's agenda, Mentese stressed that they 
are determined and decided on their struggle. 
  Mentese said that the state of emergency should be extended 
once more -- within the unity and political will displayed at 
the TGNA -- in order to properly fight terrorism and thus 
establish public security, protection of human rights, and 
respect of the law. 
  Following Mentese's statement, discussions on the 
government recommendation began. Oral Gullu, Usak deputy of the 
Social Democrat Populist Party [SDPP], expressing his party's 
views, stated that nobody has the power to divide the Turkish 
Republic. 
  ANAP [Motherland Party] whip Hasan Korkmazcan, stated that 
they agree with the reasoning of the government regarding the 
recommendation but that they are against this issue being 
exploited politically by the goverment. 
  Prosperity Party Bitlis Deputy Zeki Ergeten stated the 
government is not taking any measures to prevent terrorism 
adding that Western countries are behind the terrorist actions. 
  Murat Karayalcin, SDPP leader, state minister and deputy 
prime minister, stated that terrorism which started in 1984 has 
been institutionalized by politicians who underestimated it as 
the work of three to five bandits. Explaining that the 
statement he issued a couple of days ago was erroneously 
interpreted by the press, Karayalcin reiterated that he has 
never used the word coup and that he has never linked anything 
to the chief of the General Staff or other military forces 
commanders. Karayalcin pointed out that he interprets some of 
the recent incidents as the ploys of those that want to obstruct 
democracy. 
  Ismail Kosebe, True Path Party [TPP] Erzurum deputy, 
expressing his party's views, said that significant developments 
were achieved as a result of the government's determination and 
that the brains behind the PKK have been destroyed. The TPP 
deputy also stressed that 1994 will be the end of terrorism. 
  Answering criticisms and views on behalf of the government, 
Mentese said that the military forces, the gendarmerie, and the 
security forces serving in the state of emergency region are 
working in coordination adding that they are inflicting great 
losses to the separatist organization. Indicating that the 
government is decided on eradicating this issue from its roots, 
Mentese added there is a significant decrease in the number of 
bandits as a result of the government's determination and the 
success of the security forces. 
  Noting that tranquility has been established in the 
southeast 
Anatolia cities, Mentese announced that the bandits will be 
wiped out in extensive operations which will be conducted in the 
coming days. On the lifting of the immunities of the deputies 
who support the PKK, Mentese said that the Assembly will fulfill 
its historical responsibility on this issue. [passage omitted] 
  Following the discussions, voting took place and 
subsequently 
the recommendation submitted by the Prime Minister's office was 
approved.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over stills of Ataturk and of Prime </F>
Minister Ciller] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has called on everyone 
who is sincerely loyal to Ataturk's principles and reforms to 
come to a rally to be held at Taksim Square in Istanbul at 1200 
on Monday, 28 February. She invited the president, the speaker 
of the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA], all the political 
parties except for the Prosperity Party [PP] and the Democracy 
Party [DEP], all the democratic establishments, and citizens to 
come to the rally. She said: Together, let us oppose those who 
are trying to destroy Ataturk's republic, the unity of our 
country and nation, and the democratic and secular state order. 
  In a written statement she issued today, the prime minister 
pointed out that the public is deeply concerned that a party 
which claims will set up a just order is engaging -- in line 
with certain dark intentions and calculations -- in ugly and 
extremely dangerous activities aimed against Ataturk and the 
secular Turkish state he symbolizes. She added: Regretfully, 
it is being observed that some of the representatives of this 
party in the TGNA have clearly established a front against our 
republic and the secular order which we established with great 
difficulty and are trying to uphold, and that they take their 
daring and insolence so far as to insult our great leader 
Ataturk. It has also been observed that certain deputies, 
including a True Path Party [TPP] deputy -- who are all members 
of the TGNA, the existence of which we owe to Ataturk himself -- 
share and support this dark, fanatic, and anachronistic view. 
We have the honor of being loyal to Ataturk's principles and we 
are proud of this virtue. 
  Ciller stressed that she will not allow anyone to insult the 
great leader Ataturk -- who left an important mark on the 20th 
century with his ideas and reforms -- his reforms, or the 
secular order. She added: It is impossible for the enemies of 
Ataturk to remain in our midst. The TPP has sent this deputy -- 
whose views we can never share -- to the disciplinary council to 
be ousted from the party. It should be known that the action of 
these deputies who have taken a stand against secularism, and 
who have slandered and thus betrayed the founder of the Turkish 
Republic, the great Ataturk, will not remain unanswered. 
Whatever is necessary will be done. 
  Ciller pointed out that now is the time to protect Ataturk 
and all his principles and reforms, mainly secularism. She 
added: For this purpose, I call on our honorable president, the 
speaker of the TGNA, all the political parties except for the PP 
and DEP, our democratic establishments, and all our honorable 
citizens: Together, let us oppose those who are trying to 
destroy Ataturk's republic, the unity of our country and nation, 
and the democratic and secular state order. From the president 
to the simplest citizens, from deputies to civil servants and 
workers, and from prosecutors to students, let us all meet at 
the rally of respect to Ataturk we will hold at Taksim Square in 
Istanbul at 1200 on Monday, 28 February. We are waiting for all 
those who are sincerely loyal to Ataturk and to his principles 
and reforms which we protect to come to the Istanbul rally with 
Turkish flags in their hands.

  [Text] Ankara, Feb.25 (A.A) -- Deputy spokesman of 
parliament Vefa Tanir rejected a motion given by 12 deputies 
which demanded the restoring of the honor of a group of 
anti-Kemalists who were tried and executed 70 years ago as their 
plot to assassinate Turkey's leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk has 
been brought into light. 
  Tanir sent a letter to fundamentalist Prosperity Party 
member 
Hasan Mezarci, who led 11 more deputies in the initiative, 
saying that, "your motion which attempts to degrade a certain 
period of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and Mustafa Kemal 
Ataturk, our great leader who has founded the Turkish state and 
republic and which, hurts the feelings of the public opinion, 
has been rejected, under article 68 of the parliamentary 
regulations." 
  Anti-Kemalist politician Hasan Mezarci, who announces in 
every occasion that he is against the secularist and democratic 
principles of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, led eleven more deputies 
from various parties, in his initiative. 
  As the only True Path Party member in the motion, Melik 
Firat 
had been subjected to disciplinary action by his party just 
after the motion was handed to parliament, another signatory, 
Okkes Sendiller from Great Unity Party (UBP) decided to withdraw 
his name from the motion.

  [Excerpts] Eight RP [Welfare Party] deputies who had signed 
an anti-Ataturk parliamentary motion have withdrawn their 
signatures. (Oyke Semdiler), a member of the Great Unity Party, 
had already made such a decision. The motion still carries the 
signatures of Hasan Mezarci [the sponsor of the motion], Melik 
Firat from True Path Party, and two DEP [Democracy Party] 
deputies. 
  Hasan Mezarci could be expelled from his party [Welfare 
Party]. The administrative council of the RP parliamentary group 
consigned him to the group's disciplinary committee. Sevket 
Kazan, deputy leader of RP parliamentary group, said that since 
the day of his election Mezarci has been acting in violation of 
party discipline. Sevket Kazan said that despite verbal 
warnings, Mezarci continued to act in ways that eroded the 
party's public image and that is why he was sent to the 
disciplinary committee by unanimous vote. 
  In the meantime, Hasan Mezarci's motion, which called for 
the 
rehabilitation of those who were executed for trying to 
assassinate Ataturk in Izmir, was rejected in Parliament even 
without submitting it to normal procedure. Vefa Taner, deputy 
speaker of Parliament, said that a motion that demeans and 
incriminates Ataturk and Parliament cannot even be considered. 
  Hasan Mezarci drew reactions from everybody, from ordinary 
people to the president. The most interesting reaction came 
from the presidency of the General Staff. The General Staff 
spokesman made the following one-sentence statement: The 
Turkish Armed Forces cannot accept as its counterparts those who 
hold such perverted ideas. President Demirel described attack 
on Ataturk as a subversion and provocation. 
  [Begin recording] [Metin Corabatir] President Demirel said 
that an attack on Ataturk would very much disturb me and the 
Turkish people. Indicating that raving souls always have enmity 
for Ataturk, Demirel said that these things are being done to 
undermine peace in Turkey, and those who are doing such things 
will eventually realize that they are simply in a daze. 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said the following while leaving 
the parliament: 
  [Ciller] We were deeply grieved that an Erzerum deputy was 
involved in this. The Administrative Council of our 
parliamentary group met yesterday and we asked the Disciplinary 
Committee to definitely expel this deputy from the party. This 
is our stance. Let our people rest assured we will oppose 
anything that opposes Ataturk. Our state is great and lofty, 
and will continue to walk the path charted by the lofty Ataturk. 
  [Corabatir] ANAP [Motherland Party] leader Masut Yilmaz 
described the deputies who signed the motion as people holding 
perverted views. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  SHP [Social Democrat Populist Party] leader Murat Karayalcin 
described Hasan Mezarci's anti-Ataturk statements as part of a 
plot being hatched by forces opposing democracy. During his 
Istanbul tour today, Murat Karayalcin said that for a long time 
now secular institutions in Turkey have been facing serious 
difficulties. 
  [Begin recording] [Fatma Korunoglu] Is Turkey being dragged 
into something with Mezarci's statements? 
  [Karayalcin] That is what I am trying to discern. We are 
already in a tense situation. We have been experiencing a 
number of incidents one after another. These could be planned 
or coincidental; that is not important. But, these incidents, 
coming one after another, are further exacerbating the tense 
election atmosphere in Turkey. These are certainly the plans 
and actions of the antidemocratic forces and circles. We must 
realize this, and must be able to assess very well the 
consequences that might result. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] On his election bus, Karayalcin also referred to 
coup rumors. 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] Apparently, there are people 
who 
need to hear the word "coup." They are trying to extract other 
meanings from my statements. They say: He is saying there will 
be a coup; let him reveal the names of those who want to make a 
coup. I replied, saying that I do not know these circles, and I 
would have revealed them had I known them. But, again I cannot 
interpret these incidents in any other way. That is, I see all 
these attacks, bombings, murders, and statements as the work of 
forces outside the pale of democracy. [end recording]

  [Text] While Turkey was searching for tolerance and peace 
on the eve of the local elections scheduled to be held in 30 
days, a distressing development for democracy took place in 
Ankara today. With a surprise decision, the Democracy Party 
[DEP] announced that it was withdrawing from the 27 March local 
elections. 
  This is how DEP leader Hatip Dicle announced this decision, 
which was made following a two-day Party Assembly meeting and 
shocked the political arena: 
  [Begin recording] [Dicle] Following a two-day meeting, the 
Party Assembly overwhelmingly decided to withdraw from the 27 
March 1994 nationwide local elections, in which we were being 
forced to participate only for show after our wings were clipped 
under the oppression of the village guards, special teams, 
soldiers, and police so as not to become tools of these 
anti-democratic policies that aim at eliminating our people's 
will. 
  Despite the importance of the elections, our Party Assembly, 
moved by the consideration to assist in the holding of 
democratic and free elections, made this decision in the belief 
that the local elections have now lost their legality and that 
no other alternative was left open to the party. I hereby 
announce this to the public. [applause] 
  [Unidentified reporter] May I ask something? 
  [Dicle] Friends, I am making the following request from the 
reporters: Our party's decision and everything else are found 
in these [video shows Dicle holding a two-page statement from 
which he read the party decision]. There is no need for 
questions. 
  [Unidentified reporter] There is something missing there. 
  [Dicle] No, everything is there. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is the decision to withdraw in the 
form of boycotting the elections, or..... 
  [Dicle, interrupting] It is a withdrawal from the elections. 
This is what the Party Assembly decided. 
  [Unidentified reporter] So, your electors are free to vote 
for any party? 
  [Dicle] There is no such thing. We had already announced 
that our party will cast no votes for any of the regime's 
parties. [end recording] 
  This decision made by the DEP was voted on and adopted after 
two-day marathon discussions. The DEP's second consultative 
meeting took place at the very time when all the attention was 
focused on this party. While the party's provincial and 
district chairmen, assembly members, municipal candidates, and 
parliamentary deputies were attending this meeting, the public 
was still discussing Hatip Dicle's statement on the Tuzla 
massacre. Before the meeting, there was talk that the wing 
opposing Dicle was going to raise the question of the party's 
leader. But, during the meeting the cadre problems were put 
aside and the proposal to withdraw from the local elections were 
put up for debate. Though the candidates from the western 
provinces opposed the decision to withdraw, upper-level party 
officials put their weight in favor of a withdrawal. And the 
withdrawal decision was made when 36 members of the Party 
Assembly joined the leaders.

  [Text] The DEP's [Democracy Party] decision not to 
participate in the elections had an explosive effect in the 
political arena. While certain politicians described it as sad 
development for democracy, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller called it 
running away from the elections. 
  This is how the politicians assessed the DEP's withdrawal 
from the political arena so close to the elections and when it 
had fielded its candidates all over Turkey: 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said: I was expecting such a 
decision. This is running away. I always said that the 
elections will be held in a secure atmosphere. Everyone will 
vote freely for whomever he wants. This is what they feared 
most. 
  CHP [Republican People's Party] leader Deniz Baykal said: I 
hope that this decision will not turn into a protest, for then a 
difficult situation will arise. The DEP should reconsider its 
decision. 
  Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said: This is cowardice. It 
was impossible for them to win in the elections. They were 
looking for a pretext not to take part in the elections. 
  Nihat (Marka), deputy leader of SHP [Social Democrat 
Populist 
Party] parliamentary group, said: They should have run in the 
elections for the sake of democracy. From the viewpoint of 
democracy, this decision is deplorable. 
  Sevket Kazan, deputy leader of the RP [Welfare Party] 
parliamentary group, said: The DEP made this decision fearing 
that it will not be able to win the elections. It had lost its 
hope on the elections.

<F P=106> ["Analysis" by Ismet G. Imset: "Dicle's Mission: Closing </F>
Down Democracy Party"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Recent statements made by Kurdish based 
Democracy Party (DEP) chairman Hatip Dicle and Friday's [20 
February] bomb attack on the party headquarters in Ankara have 
made it even more clear that Dicle's mission in the DEP is to 
have the party closed down altogether. If those within the DEP 
want their pro-Kurdish political party to survive and if they 
are sincere in their bid for unity between the Kurds and turks, 
they must either toppled the Dicle flank as soon as possible or 
resign from the party. Otherwise, they have to accept that under 
Dicle's management, the party is serving only to fan alienation 
between the people who make up modern Turkey and to take the 
country to the brink of civil war. 
  The election of Dicle as the party's chairman last December 
was the result of three developments known to all observers. 
Firstly, Turkey's military solution to the Kurdish crisis, 
which prevented any moderate approach or political initiative, 
had naturally strengthened radical trends within the Kurdish 
armed and political movement. Second, Dicle had maintained an 
upper hand in relations with the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] leadership and had thus strengthened his own local 
support through their support of him. Third, the moderates were 
too weak seriously to challenge him during the convention. 
  It was evident, months before Dicle's election to the party 
chairmanship, that the hardline trend which has taken over the 
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was having its impact on this 
party as well. 
  Through reports of DEP radicals reaching the PKK chairman 
and 
his close aides, the party's moderate and peaceful 
parliamentarians became targets, and were harshly criticised for 
the lives they lived. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, receiving his 
only information on DEP from the party's hardliners, lashed out 
at everyone "living in the lodgings" referring to 
parliamentarians, and in a highly Marxist-Leninist tone, accused 
them for living in a bourgeois style. 
  Ocalan's European-based political adviser Kani Yilmaz issued 
a statement about the same time, calling for the DEP to withdraw 
from parliament altogether and telling its parliamentarians to 
return to their people. 
  The main motive of the PKK leadership prior to Dicle's 
election was for the party to be closed down, the democratic 
platform to be abandoned altogether and everyone to go 
underground. 
  A TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] analysis published when Dicle 
took 
power had rung the necessary alarm bells: "Perhaps the best way 
to explain what is going on in Turkey's Democracy Party is to 
define it as the Hatip Dicle Syndrome--if one wants to avoid 
openly to brand it the PKK takeover," it had said. 
  Even then it was evident that in reality: "Nothing is to be 
the same for the DEP any longer, and those who in the past 
argued that the party's policies were too radical can now parade 
on the streets. For, looking at what the new DEP chairman is 
saying and doing, the word `radical' may indeed be too light an 
expression to describe where the party is headed after this." 
The December DEP convention had started off spreading hope in 
the hearts of many turks (even the most cynical ones) that the 
party had finally seen the realities and that it could pull 
itself together. Even columnists such as Emin Colasan, who have 
been the staunchest critics of this pro-Kurdish entity, wrote 
advice to the party to conclude its metamorphosis. 
  But many missed the irony behind the window dressing. Days 
in advance of the convention, a decision was made to ban any 
flags other than the Turkish and party flags and even slogans 
had been censored. It was decided that party officials would 
prohibit any "unwanted" demonstrations and slogans. A decision 
was also made not to decorate the meeting hall with the 
red-yellow-green colors of the Kurdish flag as in previous 
gatherings of similar nature. 
  In the words of one newspaper, it appeared that the DEP was 
seeking "a new and Turkish image" for itself. Television news 
programs even claimed that the party was to open up to Turkish 
candidates and accept them to run for local and general 
elections. The window dressing was to demonstrate that this 
Kurdish-based party was becoming part of the Turkish political 
apparatus. 
  But it was evident to observers that something was seriously 
wrong with the way things were going in the party and thus those 
who followed Kurdish politics closely were not surprised by the 
result. 
  On the one hand, the DEP was trying to give the impression 
that it was in the midst of a serious policy change and turning 
to moderate views. On the other, it was certain from even 
before the convention that Dicle, one of the most radical 
activists, would win. 
  In his first speech as chairman, which angered millions of 
Turks, Dicle literally praised the PKK, branded it as a 
political party, defined it as a counterpart and defended its 
position. Although he said the DEP and PKK were different 
entities and that the former was a legal organization, the 
message he gave was that nothing could be done to solve the 
Kurdish issue without reserving a place for the PKK at the table. 
  This was, as far as Turkish public opinion was concerned, a 
clear indication that the DEP had set its goals and priorities. 
It was evident from then on that as long as Dicle ran the 
party, the future of the DEP lay with the PKK. 
  Dicle's position was clear from the very beginning for the 
DEP moderates. According to them, he had direct links with the 
PKK leadership; he even reported on his own colleagues to Ocalan 
and he had completely taken charge of the DEP-PKK link. As for 
the PKK, its position is also clear. In January 1994 alone, a 
total of 254 militants were killed by security forces in the 
troubled region. The Zhalah camp was bombed and bombings of 
camps inside Turkey still continue. 
  It is thus clear that what the PKK needs at a time like 
this, 
when it is concentrating more than ever on building up its 
strength in the region, is to get as many people as possible up 
to the mountains. 
  A closure of the DEP, or its complete alienation with a 
majority of Turks, is thus crucial for the PKK's own hardline 
plans and will undoubtedly serve the PKK's interests in the near 
future for it will be used to legitimize illegal and armed 
struggle in the Southeast. 
  This can best be seen in the PKK leadership's constant 
argument, supported lately by Dicle, that the doors to a legal 
struggle have been closed, that Turkey is preventing all 
democratic approaches, and that the only way to solve the 
Kurdish problem is through escalated guerrilla warfare. Thus 
the window dressing of the DEP convention -- "opening up to the 
Turks" -- fits well into the picture. Once the party is closed 
down, there will be even more propaganda; that it was closed 
despite its move to extend a hand to the Turkish people and that 
Ankara, by shutting down the party, closed down the only 
peaceful way available. 
  Now, the argument, however justified it may be, that the DEP 
may be blocked in the upcoming March 27 local elections, serves 
this scenario as well. 
  Abroad, such a development, along with a closure of the 
party, will undoubtedly -- and quite rightly -- be portrayed as 
more evidence against Turkish "democratization" and to justify 
armed activities, even those targeting civilians. Such a 
message can clearly be seen in Dicle's recent remarks that the 
PKK's attack on a train station was legitimate and directed at 
"a military target." 
  It is evident that Dicle is a disgrace not only for Turkey 
as 
a whole but more importantly for the Kurdish people. He is not 
working for their benefit or for any known or justified cause. 
A TDN analysis published on Dec. 13 had correctly concluded 
that: "Now, with Dicle, the DEP will undoubtedly do all it can 
to have itself closed down as soon as possible. If there is no 
surprise development in the coming months, the Dicle Syndrome 
will be the last that the DEP ever sees. From then on there 
will only be the PKK." 
  For those who have not yet heard, the most recent 
speculation 
among Kurdish circles in Ankara is that closing shop for the DEP 
will not be an exclusive development and will actually be 
followed by "other withdrawals from the legal platform," or, to 
be quite clear, "a full withdrawal from legality." 
  The daily OZGUR GUNDEM, for instance, is now preparing to 
close down. There are also similar rumors for other legal 
pro-Kurdish organizations. 
  More or less as if there were a concerted plan underway to 
pull everyone, all Kurdish institutions, underground. What 
cannot be missed at this point is that Turkish reaction to the 
DEP has been building up for some time and has reached its peak. 
In other words, this reaction may be the key to the overall 
plan and instrumental in implementing it. 
  Thus Dicle has a great "responsibility" here in further 
fanning that reaction and alienating the Turks. His only 
success has been in doing just this. In turn, the reaction 
among a majority of Turks to armed attacks only serves to 
increase the strength of the radicals in the Kurdish movement. 
A vicious circle. 
  It is now up to those within the DEP who in private argue 
against Dicle's policies and say they sincerely support Turkey's 
unity, to take action to break this circle. 
  Either through an emergency convention which will topple 
Dicle and replace him with a moderate leader, or by resigning 
from the party altogether, such activists must immediately take 
action and differentiate themselves from the central ruling 
flank. What is equally important, for the sake of all the 
people of Turkey, is to be able to take a strong and determined 
stance against terrorism, whatever its source. 
  If those now gearing up to move against Dicle are sincere, 
they have to come out once and for all and condemn terrorism. 
They must condemn the use of terrorist tactics aimed at 
civilians for any cause and they must condemn such tactics put 
into force by the PKK. 
  Turkey today is living through a serious era of provocation 
and it does not matter from which side it comes. Dicle, for his 
part, is as dangerous as those provoking Kurdish enmity on the 
Turkish side. Everyone who genuinely wishes to break the 
vicious circle and thus to avoid a civil war or another 
interruption of democracy, has to come together and act against 
"provocateurs." For now, what is clear is that the first step 
has to come from the DEP side and the main culprit within it. 
This person, who betrays not only humanity in general but the 
Kurdish people he so much claims to be "fighting for," has to be 
either isolated with his own groups -- and left in the pit he 
has so clumsily fallen into -- or removed from the party's 
leadership. Even then, it is going to be a difficult task for 
the "moderates," since they too are now among the unwanted in 
Turkey. But at least they will have to chance to maintain their 
own dignity and perhaps, in taking the necessary action, will 
have the personal satisfaction of having given peace a chance.

  [Text] Ankara--Zhirair Liparityan, the deputy foreign 
minister of Armenia, asked on Monday [21 February] for Turkey's 
support to establish a cease-fire in the fighting between Azeri 
and Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  But while Liparityan was in Ankara, Armenian forces have 
bombed the Azeri city of Terter, 300 kilometers from the capital 
Baku, ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY reported from the region. 
Liparityan, after holding talks in the morning with Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin and Deputy Undersecretary Bigin Unan, told 
the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that "the first thing to do was to 
establish a cease-fire" before efforts are made on a political 
settlement. 
  He told Cetin during his talks that Yerevan "would like to 
see what can be done to push the peace process" but added, 
"there are steps ahead." 
  The unexpected visit was spurred by a phone call from 
Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan who called Cetin over 
the weekend. Diplomatic sources said Papazyan, apparently 
worried by the Azeri offensive to gain back their territories 
occupied by Armenian forces, told Cetin that fighting had 
intensified and asked Ankara to "assist" in establishing a 
cease-fire. Azeri and Armenian officials are presently in 
Moscow, with the hope of signing a protocol on March 1. A 
tentative accord, signed between the parties when Armenians and 
Azeris, [as published] was signed on Feb. 17, when Armenians 
promised to withdraw from the Azeri territory they occupied. 
  But the stumbling block has proved to be the Armenian 
efforts 
to buy time for the withdrawal and the mediating Russia's 
attempts to place observers in Azeri territory. 
  The Azeri Defense Minister has returned from Moscow but the 
talks are continuing through diplomatic efforts and by phone, a 
spokesman for the Azeri government said. 
  In Ankara, Liparityan told reporters, before he engaged in a 
new round of talks with Candan Azer, the Foreign Ministry's 
deputy director responsible for Caucasus Affairs: "There are a 
number of peace efforts on the table. 
  We have to see whether they can be combined." 
  Asked whether this would be done within the Minsk process, 
he 
replied: "We obviously want to do it in an international forum. 
On the other hand, it should be something that works." 
Diplomatic sources in Ankara have spoken about "giving the 
Minsk process a kick start" through multilateral efforts of 
"certain interested countries." 
  The same demand was made by Geydar Aliyev, the Azeri 
president, during his visit to Ankara last week. Aliyev said 
his country believed the Minsk forum of nine countries, under 
the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE), was the adequate forum for a political 
settlement. But he added that Baku would also welcome the 
initiative of "major countries" for the settlement of the 
problem. 
  Aliyev's words were interpreted in Ankara as a reference to 
a 
tripartite peace plan of Russia, Turkey and the United States 
which was launched last year but was integrated into the Minsk 
process. 
  Ankara, however, believes that there are gaps in the Minsk 
calendar which endorses a plan for a gradual Armenian 
withdrawal. The point was made clear to Jan Eliasson, the new 
chairman of the Minsk Group who visited Ankara last weekend. 
The Minsk Group aims to find a political settlement for the 
problem of Nagorno-Karabakh, where Azeris and Armenians have 
been fighting an undeclared war. 
  Another initiative which is on the table, but has so far 
been 
met with hesitation by Azeris, is a plan prepared by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin's advisor Aram Abramyan [Andranik 
Migranyan]. 
  Ways to establish a cease-fire and combine the plans will 
also be discussed when Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary

  [Text] Ankara, Feb.25 (A.A) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin said today that Turkey wanted to join the United Nations 
Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia, at least at a 
symbolic level. 
  After his meeting with Slovakian Premier Vladimir Meciar in 
his office, Cetin told reporters that Bosnia-Herzegovina, which 
was the victim of the conflict in the region, had actually 
voiced a request for Turkey's participation in the forces, 
besides the request made by Turkey to Western countries on the 
issue. 
  Cetin recalled that Turkey had been a country which had an 
active stand towards the issue since the beginning and was the 
only country which supported the Bosnians since then. 
  "We spent intensive efforts to bring Croatians and Bosnians 
together and we went to Sarajevo at a time no one had the 
courage to do so. We issued a Sarajevo declaration there. We 
believe, as stated by our premier, Turkey's contributions are 
vital for a lasting peace in the region," he said

  [Text] Istanbul, Feb 24 (A.A) -- Premier Tansu Ciller said 
on Wednesday [25 February] that there was no need to invest in 
foreign currency. 
  Ciller assured businessmen during a meeting held in Istanbul 
that they need not to invest on foreign currency "what we need 
is solidarity and confidence" she added. 
  She said "Turkey could only overcome its economic problems 
by 
being shoulder to shoulder" and called for support from the 
businessmen. 
  Ciller said there was no increase in inflation at the 
moment, 
"the only thing we should do is to increase the entrance of 
foreign exchange." 
  The Central Bank effectively devaluated the Turkish lira by 
nearly 12 percent against the dollar on Wednesday. Turkish 
newspapers, comparing banknote rates, calculated the change at 
13.6 percent. 
  The Turkish lira ended on Thursday at 17,600-700 to the 
dollar after Central Bank intervention above 17,500 restored 
some calm to markets. The Turkish lira was devaluated to 17,250 
on Wednesday night. 
  Exporters, whose goods will become more competitive abroad, 
said short-term cost inflation arising from devaluation could 
nevertheless disrupt industrial production.

  [Text] Prime Minister Jean Chretien says Canada will take 
unilateral action if foreign vessels do not respect an 
international agreement to halt fishing on the Grand Bank off 
the east coast. Mr. Chretien says Canada may even extend its 
200-mile offshore economic zone to protect depleted stocks. 
  Canada has negotiated a one-year moratorium with more than a 
dozen other nations to protect threatened species in waters that 
straddle the Grand Bank or are just outside. Alvin Cater 
reports: 
  [Cater] At the legislature building in St John's, the prime 
minister listened to pleas for help from people whose lives have 
been ruined by the collapse of the Atlantic fishery. For two 
years a ban on the northern cod has deprived them of their 
livelihood. But foreign vessels have continued to fish just 
outside Canadian waters on the nose and the tail of the Grand 
Bank. In Brussels last week some European nations agreed to a 
moratorium on east coast fishing. Today Chretien warned Canada 
is preparing to flex its legislative muscle if the foreign 
fishing doesn't stop. 
  [Begin Chretien recording] The bill will be ready within 
weeks. As soon as the fishing starts again, if it's not 
respected, the bill will be passed and we will use the resources 
we have to make sure that the bill is respected. [end recording] 
  [Cater] Chretien wouldn't say how the government will police 
the nose and the tail of the Grand Bank if it extends Canada's 
jurisdiction. 
  Many people in the audience have been receiving federal aid 
since the ban was imposed but because of this week's budget 
they'll be receiving smaller checks. The prime minister only 
talked about the budget as he answered reporters' questions. He 
admitted the aid program is being scaled back but he insisted 
the cuts will not be drastic. 
  [Begin Chretien recording] There will be some change. I 
cannot deny that. But those who say that they will be cut in 
half, they will have to swallow their words. [end recording] 
  [Cater] The prime minister also said the government had no 
choice but to slash unemployment insurance [UI] benefit. 
Otherwise, he said, the UI fund would eventually go broke.

  [Text] Brussels (DPA) -- In Brussels on Monday [28 
February] NATO issued the following statement on the downing of 
four aircraft over Bosnia- Herzegovina (text as translated by 
DPA): 
  "This morning two NATO combat aircraft, which were 
monitoring 
the airspace, downed four Galeb military aircraft near Banja 
Luka in Bosnia-Herzegovina, after these had entered the no-fly 
zone that was imposed by the United Nations. The UN Security 
Council Resolution 816 bans all unauthorized flights by 
helicopters or aircraft in the airspace of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and permits all necessary measures to ensure 
compliance with this ban. 
  "At 0648 (Central European Time) the NATO F-16-type aircraft 
of the U.S. Air Force engaged six aircraft. The pilots asked 
the aircraft to land according to instructions; otherwise, they 
would attack. This request was ignored. The NATO Flying 
Falcons then attacked, downing four of them."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to Edmond Alphandery, French 
minister of economics and finance, France is "more ready than 
ever to establish the European Monetary Union [EMU] with Germany 
and other states that are ready for it." In this process, 
German-French partnership is more indispensable than ever, 
Alphandery said, according to the prereleased script of a speech 
he will deliver in Bonn on Tuesday evening [24 February] at an 
event organized by the Federation of German Chambers of Industry 
and Commerce, where he will speak to about 400 leading German 
industry representatives. 
  The second stage of the EMU, which has been underway since 
January, requires even closer political cooperation so as to 
adjust the basic economic data for the third stage, Alphandery 
said. The issue is not only public finances and conditions for 
healthy and lasting growth. What is necessary is "solidarity 
and determined action with persistence so as to further develop 
the competitiveness of the companies and combat unemployment." 
The preservation of social peace also depends on solving 
Europe's competitive problems. 
  Alphandery called for implementing the growth initiative of 
the European Union with loans of ECU8 billion (about 15 billion 
German marks) by the European Investment Bank. This is a path 
to make Europe resistance to trade protectionism and to keep it 
open for world trade. In this connection, he recalled the 
intensive German-French cooperation in concluding the new GATT 
world trade agreement. 
  The European Monetary System must not be called into 
question, the French finance minister said. The extension of 
the exchange rate margins in 1993 was a success. Monetary 
policy cooperation between Germany and France and the close 
interlacing of the two national economies have also contributed 
to mastering the dangers of inflation in other European 
countries. According to Alphandery, there are 2,000 German 
companies in France and 1,000 French companies in Germany.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 26 (AFP) -- Negotiations to bring 
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the European Union [EU] 
were suspended on Saturday [26 February] night with little 
progress made in the principal sticking points, EU officials 
said. 
  Norway refused to accept EU proposals over fishing and 
Austria rejected a proposal to relax strict curbs on polluting 
truck traffic across the Austrian Alps, the officials said. 
  The negotiations were due to resume on Sunday. The Greek 
president of the EU's Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, 
said they faced a make-or-break deadline of Monday midnight. 
  Failure to meet this deadline means that the political 
target 
to bring the four candidates into the Union officially next 
January 1 will probably be missed.

<F P=106> [Article by Bodil Jessen: "Nyrup Denies Conflict on Defense </F>
Policy"] 
  [Text] Toward Election: The Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
is standing fast on the National Compromise, which, among other 
things, says no to joint defense in the Western European Union 
[WEU]. 
  The four government parties are going into the Folketing 
election on their own platforms and will not run on a joint 
program, asserted Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (SDP) 
yesterday [12 February]. Nyrup denied on the same occasion that 
the Center Democrats' [CD] positive stand on the Western 
European Union would be a problem in a future governing 
coalition. 
  This is being said following CD political spokesman Peter 
Duetoft's announcement last week that Danish participation in 
the West European Union should be part of [the program] in a new 
governing coalition. 
  "The Center Democrats have their view, but this will have to 
be dealt with when we know the election outcome," said Rasmussen 
after a meeting between the SDP Folketing group and the party's 
leadership council. 
  At the joint meeting the SDP's European and domestic policy 
goals were adopted. The SDP stands firm on the National 
Compromise and says no to a common defense and a common currency. 
  Regarding the latest cabinet shake-up, Rasmussen said: "The 
leadership council understands the government shake-up of 28 
January. The decision yesterday (the departure of Bente Juncker 
-- BERLINGSKE TIDENDE SONDAG editor) had been under study by the 
leadership council, which was unanimous in the decision."

a statement made in Makhairas after a memorial service for 
Grigorios Avxendiou, Kliridhis said that in his first report the 
UN secretary general will not say much. He added that the 
report will say that both sides have accepted the UN secretary 
general's proposals in principle and will call on them to 
intensify their efforts so that a way to implement the CBM's is 
found. 
  Kliridhis said that Butrus-Ghali will attribute 
responsibilities, if any, in his next report, which will be 
submitted three weeks after the first one. Responding to a 
question, the president said that he will not go to Athens now 
because there is nothing new.

  [Text] Ankara--Turkey's outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan 
(PKK) is organizing a three-day "Kurdish conference" in Moscow 
starting today, reliable sources told the TDN [TURKISH DAILY 
NEWS] on Monday [21 February]. The meeting is seen as the first 
step towards enhancing relations and understanding between the 
organization and Russian officials. The conference comes after 
an influential Russian newspaper reported last Friday that 
Moscow might establish relations with the PKK in retaliation for 
"Ankara's use of the Chechen card" against Russia. 
  The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA said in its report that such an 
initiative on Moscow's part was natural, and argued that it was 
illogical that their relations with Kurds were so limited. The 
paper also said there were representatives of the PKK both in 
Russia and in Armenia, and that they had established contact 
with officials there. 
  Moscow-based sources said on Monday that the conference, 
called "History of Kurdistan," was organized by the Kurdistan 
Committee-Moscow, one of the PKK's committee offices that are 
widespread throughout the region. 
  The main participant at the conference is the PKK's 
so-called 
Kurdistan National Liberation Front (ERNK), although "other 
Kurdish parties" have also been invited to attend. 
  According to TDN sources, the Russian Ministry of National 
Affairs is actively involved in organizing the meeting, in which 
the "current developments in Turkey" will be the main topic 
discussed. 
  The nationalist Kurdish movement in general, a review of the 
Kurdish movement in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, as well as 
terrorism, were cited among the issues to be discussed. Sources 
close to the PKK had said earlier this year that the PKK had 
rented several apartment blocks in Moscow and was aiming at 
improving its relations with Russia. 
  In recent weeks, messages have been sent from the ERNK to 
Russian officials requesting for the establishment of relations 
and cooperation. 
  Although Russia's policy related to Turkish Kurds has not 
been voiced openly, Western diplomatic sources say that Moscow 
seems to want to see Ankara sitting at the table and negotiating 
with the PKK. 
  On March 1, Bilgin Unan, deputy undersecretary at the 
Turkish 
Foreign Ministry, will be visiting Moscow as part of routine 
political consultations between the two countries. A statement 
released by the ministry said on Monday that Unan would visit 
Russia as guest of First Deputy Russian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Adamishin. Bilateral relations and regional and 
international problems are to be on the agenda of talks.

<F P=106> [Article by UK Prime Minister John Major: "SF [Sinn Fein] </F>
Cannot Argue for Peace and Frustrate It"] 
  [Text] We have heard a great deal from Gerry Adams about 
his commitment to peace and his belief that "we are in the final 
phase of the conflict." 
  We have had plenty of words, but it is not words people 
want. 
The huge numbers of people in the north and south of Ireland, in 
the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere, who support 
the Joint Declaration, want an end to violence. An end to 
sickening events like last week's killing of a community 
policeman by the IRA. An end to murders, equally atrocious, 
equally pointless, by the loyalist paramilitaries. 
  Professions do not sit well with bombs and bullets. 
  Albert Reynolds and I are at one in seeking peace in 
Northern 
Ireland. That was why we negotiated the Joint Declaration. It 
is for us, a foundation stone, a set of principles which will 
stand the test of time. 
  Two months on from the Declaration, no-one, I believe, can 
credibly argue that it is not properly understood. The 
Declaration is clear. If there is genuine doubt about anything 
it says, the text itself can dispel that doubt. We shall not 
open back-door negotiations by glossing or shading the 
Declaration's language and meaning. 
  Let me repeat what it says about self-determination, because 
this has been misrepresented. 
  First the British government has no..."selfish, strategic or 
economic interest in Northern Ireland." 
  That doesn't mean that we don't care about it, nor that we 
don't share the interest of its people in a secure, prosperous 
and peaceful future. 
  It does mean that we would have no reason to wish to 
frustrate the democratically expressed wishes of the people. We 
shall abide by these wishes, and if the people prefer to remain 
in the United Kingdom, as they have done so far, we shall uphold 
their right to do so. 
  Second, our primary interest is to see peace, stability and 
reconciliation established by agreement among all the people who 
inhabit the Island. We will work with the constitutional 
parties and Irish government to achieve such an agreement, which 
may, as of right, take the form of agreed structures for the 
island as a whole, including a united Ireland achieved by 
peaceful means. But, again, I emphasise this must be by consent 
not imposition. 
  The way such agreement is to be achieved is set out clearly. 
  We say that "it is for the people of the island of Ireland 
alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to 
exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of 
consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south, to 
bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish." 
  Third, we will "introduce the necessary legislation to give 
effect to this, or equally to any measure of agreement on future 
relationships in Ireland which the people living in Ireland may 
themselves freely so determine without external impediment." 
  In short, democracy will prevail. No other route is 
possible. 
  The Joint Declaration leaves no conceivable reason for 
continued violence. The reasons given by the republican 
movement in the past no longer exist. That is not just my view. 
It is the view which has been expressed by the most respected 
leaders of the nationalist community, including of course, John 
Hume. 
  Does Mr Adams share this view? If not, why not? The people 
have the right to know. He cannot be permitted to argue for 
peace and yet frustrate it. 
  If Sinn Fein believes in peace, the violence should stop. 
  Let me be plain on another point. The British government 
will, as I said in the Declaration, "encourage, facilitate and 
enable the achievement of such agreement." We will, however, 
not try to persuade people to go for Irish unity. It is not the 
government's job to tell the Irish people what they should 
think, or to dictate to them where their future should lie. 
  But what we do advocate is agreement, reached freely and 
democratically. I do not believe that the Irish people want the 
British government to coerce the greater number in the north 
into a united Ireland against their will. Nor does the 
Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds]. Albert 
Reynolds has publicly opposed such coercion. He has said in the 
Joint Declaration that a united Ireland should not be imposed. 
We both believe that the people living the island of Ireland, 
north and south respectively, should decide. There can be no 
coercion. 
  Before the Declaration was published, there was a lot of 
speculation about what it would say. Many confident predictions 
were made, most of them wrong. 
  So I point out, once it was published, all those things it 
did not say which people had been led to expect. It did not set 
out or require any particular outcome; after all, it is not a 
solution. But nor does the Declaration rule anything out, 
providing only it is achieved peacefully, by agreement and 
consent. 
  What matters now is what is in the Declaration, and that it 
provides a foundation for progress towards a lasting settlement. 
What matters is to end the killing. Every death, every injury, 
every bereavement is an affront. Over a quarter of a century, 
violence has made no headway. But it has caused terrible pain 
on both sides of the community. The voices raised against 
violence on all sides have grown stronger and more insistent 
over the past year. They helped us to produce the Joint 
Declaration. They explain the extraordinary level of support 
given to it. The overwhelming majority of the people of 
Northern Ireland want an end to violence now. Will their voices 
be heeded? 
  Sinn Fein claims not to understand the place of the 
Declaration in a "peace process." There is nothing obscure 
about this either. The Declaration is not a peace plan. It 
certainly isn't a solution on its own. It is simply the view of 
the two governments about the principles involved in a process 
leading to an agreed outcome. 
  Those central principles are democracy, and an absence of 
coercion - in other words consent, no outside interference and 
an end to violence. 
  As a first step, those principles have to be publicly 
accepted and acted upon. 
  We would be ready within three months of an end to violence 
to begin an exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. Its aims would 
be to discuss how Sinn Fein would become involved in the 
three-stranded political talks how they could be brought fully 
into normal political life in Northern Ireland, and what the 
consequence of ending violence would be. They know this is our 
intention; we told them of it last November. 
  I believe this amounts to a substantial exploratory agenda. 
  Those exploratory discussions would in themselves be part of 
the process of bringing Sinn Fein back into normal political 
life, in developing a normal political dialogue between the 
government and other parties, on matters like education, 
housing, healthcare, crime and fair employment. 
  They could only take place against a background where 
violence had no place. As confidence returned, the pracical 
consequences of that would be felt across Northern Ireland. 
  The question of continuing violence is the key. I heartily 
endorse the idea that the gun should be taken out of Irish 
politics. But who has kept it there? Last year terrorists (not 
all of them republican by any means) killed 86 people. The 
security forces killed none. If the terrorists discard the gun 
for good, we shall in time be able to manage without British 
soldiers in support of the RUC and without emergency legislation. 
  Now as to the political talks. As the Taoiseach and I 
declared and I declared last Saturday [19 February]; the talks 
process is moving ahead. Sinn Fein are free to come in to 
democratic life. They can stay out, if they so decide. But 
they can't hold the talks up. It would be wrong of me to 
predict their outcome, but certain things are plain. 
  First, civil rights must and will be carefully protected. 
Power must be exercised fairly. We are all resolved on that. 
  Second, I expect to see institutions and new relationships 
reflecting the common interests in the island, as it faces the 
challenges of a competitive world and the opportunities of 
politial agreement. The character and depth of these is very 
much for discussion. 
  Third, the two governments will be building on the close 
partnership we already have as members of the European Union and 
as good neighbours in these islands. 
  Whatever may be the shape of final agreement in the talks, 
it 
will not be imposed on anyone. It will be the people who will 
have decided. 
  There is no purpose in living in the past. Dreadful deeds 
have been done by all sides in past centuries. We should all 
regret that, but those of us alive today are not responsible for 
them. 
  Our generation must look to the future. We want to give to 
the people power to take the decisions affecting their own 
lives. Will Sinn Fein take the opportunity? Will they now 
renounce violence, and trust the people? Or will they continue 
to inflict on the people further cruel and futile violence?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An Offer Sinn Fein Cannot Refuse"] </F>
  [Text] The amount of information about the Downing Street 
declaration now in the public domain is enormous. Sinn Fein 
cannot complain that the declaration has not been clarified. It 
has been explained time and time again by political leaders in 
Ireland and Britain. 
  Today, in the Irish News, British Prime Minister John Major 
makes an impassioned plea to Sinn Fein to accept the declaration 
as the basis for a settlement of the problems facing this 
country. It is one of the most significant contributions to the 
debate since the declaration was unveiled in London in December. 
  Mr Major is not alone in hoping the Sinn Fein ard fhets [as 
published] will take a permanent and courageous step towards 
democracy. The declaration has gained the support of the 
overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and in Britain; and 
it is seen as the basis for peace with honour in other countries 
sympathetic to the Irish cause. 
  The thrust of the party's policies over the past decade 
makes 
the final step to full democracy inevitable, its leaders realise 
that; now its members must accept that their party can only play 
a full and vital role in Ireland when their policy direction 
reaches its logical conclusion. 
  One of the most important paragraphs in Mr Major's article 
is 
addressed directly to Sinn Fein. He says: 
  "Sinn Fein claims not to understand the place of the 
declaration in the `peace process'. There is nothing obscure 
about this... The declaration is not a peace plan, it certainly 
isn't a solution on its own. It is simply the view of the two 
governments about the principles involved in a process leading 
to an agreed outcome. Those central principles are democracy, 
and an absence of coercion -- in other words consent, no outside 
interference and an end to violence." 
  The message to Sinn Fein is clear. No agreed outcome has 
been pre-ordained by either government; and, if it rejects 
violence, it will be able to play a full and unfettered part in 
the debate which leads to that agreed outcome. 
  Today's article by Mr Major is couched in the language of 
friendship and reconciliation. And he does not shy away from 
some of the key concerns of the Sinn Fein leadership. He is 
blunt on the issue of what he means by exploratory talks. 
  In his January 8 interview with the IRISH NEWS Mr Adams 
asked 
for clarification on what the exploratory talks would involve. 
He asked if it meant more than just a discussion with Sinn Fein 
about how the IRA could hand over its weapons. Mr Major says 
clearly today that these talks would be meaningful. 
  "We would be ready within three months of an end to violence 
to begin an exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. Its aims would 
be to discuss how Sinn Fein would become involved in the 
three-stranded political talks, how they could be brought fully 
into normal political life in Northern Ireland, and what the 
consequences of ending violence would be... I believe this 
amounts to a substantial exploratory agenda. Those exploratory 
discussions would themselves be part of the process of bringing 
Sinn Fein back into normal political life, in developing a 
normal political dialogue between the government and other 
parties, on matters like education, housing, health care, crime 
and fair employment." 
  That is a clear and positive statement which should 
encourage 
Sinn Fein to become involved, Mr Major is not just offering 
talks on a narrow agenda. 
  Mr Major has also been unambiguous about the meaning of 
self-determination, as he sees it. He re-emphasises his 
government's position that it has no "selfish, strategic or 
economic interest in Northern Ireland", and he goes on to say: 
"we would have no wish to frustrate the democratically expressed 
wishes of the people." 
  The primary policy objective of the British government, he 
says, is "to see peace, stability and reconciliation established 
by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island." 
  Britain wants to encourage agreement -- agreement which 
would 
include an input from Sinn Fein if it enters the democratic 
process fully. And he pledges to introduce any legislation 
necessary to give effect to that agreement which "the people who 
live in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without 
external impediment." 
  No Sinn Fein president could disagree with his comment "it 
is 
not the government's job to tell the Irish people what they 
should think or to dictate to them where their future should 
lie." 
  Rightly, Mr Major has said that the political talks -- on 
the 
three-strand basis which protects Irish interests -- must 
continue. The opportunity for Sinn Fein must continue. The 
opportunity for Sinn Fein to become involved is there. And he 
takes up the theme of partnership both within Ireland and 
between the British and the Irish. This aspect is critical if 
we are to copper-fasten any agreement with economic 
regeneration; and is particularly important in the context of 
the two nations' membership of the European Union. 
  Calling for an end to violence, Mr Major spells out the 
consequences: "we shall in time be able to manage without 
British soldiers in support of the RUC [Royal Ulster 
Constabulary] and without emergency legislation"; greater 
protection of civil rights; new institutions "reflecting the 
common interests in the island"; and closer partnership. 
  He does not try to limit or dictate the scope of agreement. 
"Whatever may be the shape of final agreement in the talks, it 
will not be imposed on anyone. It will be the people who will 
have decided." 
  His acknowledgement that "dreadful deeds have been done by 
all" is generous, as is his regret. His plea that "our 
generation must look to the future" is one which should be the 
motivating force for all those capable of advancing the cause of 
peace in Ireland.

<F P=106> [Interview with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F>
correspondent Vironas Karidhis in London; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Karidhis] What is the purpose of your visit to 
Athens? 
  [Hurd] It is my first opportunity to meet Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias and other Greek Government officials since 
Greece took over the European Union [EU] Presidency. We will 
discuss several issues, such as Cyprus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
the strengthening of relations with the countries of East and 
Central Europe. Expanding the EU to the East is a important aim 
of the Greek Presidency. 
  [Karidhis] What does Britain expect from the Greek 
Presidency? 
  [Hurd] Generally, we expect the Greek Government to 
implement 
the program it announced. The EU enlargement negotiations, 
which are at a critical stage, must be concluded. And the 
economy must continue to be discussed. Everyone in Europe is 
concerned with unemployment. We are also very concerned with 
the Yugoslav issue. EU countries have an important role to play 
in the former Yugoslavia. We are offering assistance, providing 
troops, and contributing to the peace process. The Greek 
Presidency has set out some goals for each of these sectors. We 
would like to contribute so that these goals are implemented. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Karidhis] Following the implementation of the Greek 
embargo, 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] is facing 
serious economic problems. In Athens, all the political parties 
represented in the Chamber of Deputies except the Greek 
Communist Party approve of the economic measures adopted by 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou against Skopje [FYROM]. The 
Greek decision surprised Brussels and greatly annoyed Greece's 
Community partners. What is the British Government's position 
on this issue? 
  [Hurd] We share the views of our EU partners. The problem 
must be settled by negotiations under UN auspices. The 
negotiations that have been suspended must resume. The Greek 
measures, which cause serious problems to a small, weak country, 
contribute to instability in the Balkans. Stability in Skopje 
is in Greece and the EU partners' interest. 
<H5>  Serious Problems </H5>
  [Karidhis] Minister, do you believe the Greek action 
violates 
international law (the UN Charter, Treaty of Rome, and 
Maastricht Treaty)? 
  [Hurd] I am not a judge expressing a legal opinion but I am 
not so much interested in the legality of the decision as in 
whether the measures can be considered wise. 
  We understand the Greek reservations. The Greek side has 
clearly expressed its fears. We believe though that the problem 
must be solved through direct talks. I do not believe it is 
reasonable to cause problems, what are probably serious 
problems, for a small country that is already in a difficult 
position because of the situation in the former Yugoslavia. 
This is our position, a position that I believe is shared by 
all of Greece's Community partners. And it must be considered 
seriously, especially now that Greece holds the EU Presidency. 
This position must be understood and not considered as hostile 
toward Greece. 
  [Karidhis] Other than the name issue, Skopje does not appear 
willing to make concessions on basic issues (the flag and the 
Constitution). I recall that Britain--an EU member--decided to 
impose an embargo on Argentina during the war in the Falkland 
islands. 
  [Hurd] We took measures against Argentina not because it 
pursued the Falkland islands, but because Argentine forces 
attacked and occupied the islands. It is a different case. 
Dialogue with Skopje must continue. Greece may understand our 
views following the EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels 
early this week. 
  Greece is a warm supporter of the European Union, it holds 
the Presidency, and I hope that the doors that have closed 
regarding Skopje will reopen. We understand the Greek concerns 
but the problem will only be solved through negotiations. 
  [Karidhis] Let us move to another issue. You said you will 
discuss the Cyprus issue in Athens. Last October, you urged 
Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas to make new efforts to resolve the differences 
between the two communities. In your opinion, what are the 
prospects for a settlement? 
  [Hurd] Some activity has been noted since then, especially 
in 
the talks on confidence-building measures [CBMs] under Joe 
Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in 
Cyprus. Athens and London agree that Cyprus must remain united. 
We also agree that the status quo cannot continue. Both 
countries believe there are two communities in Cyprus with equal 
rights. I hope there is no disagreement between us on CBMs, 
which I considered a good start. I believe the three guarantor 
powers--Turkey, Britain, and Greece--are obliged to make every 
possible effort so that there is an agreement first on CBMs and 
then a general settlement of the problem. 
  [Karidhis] It seems there are basic differences between the 
two sides on CBMs. 
  [Hurd] I do not believe the differences are basic. There are 
differences but they are not differences of principle. I 
believe Kliridhis can reach an agreement with Denktas on the 
measures and then continue with the dialogue. I believe the 
problem will worsen if the two sides do not exploit this 
opportunity now. When I was in Cyprus in October, I realized 
there was a tendency toward intransigence on the part of the 
leadership and within the parties and among the public. If the 
CBM's are not accepted, the problem will continue, thus 
perpetuating an unfair situation, one that carries the threat of 
instability. [passage omitted] 
  [Karidhis] Minister, how do you see the future of 
Greek-British relations? 
  [Hurd] We are linked with traditional ties of friendship. We 
do not always agree 100 percent but we are very close friends. 
We speak to each other honestly. In the next few months I will 
visit Greece three times. My first visit will begin next week. 
Afterward, I will participate in the EU foreign ministers 
meeting in northern Greece, then in the EU summit in Corfu. I 
am looking forward to these visits, not because it is pleasant 
to visit Greece in the spring and summer, but because I will 
have the opportunity for close talks. I believe this has always 
been one of the characteristics of the friendship between the 
two countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Fate of Hong Kong"] </F>
  [Text] With the Legislative Council [LegCo] vote in favour 
of the first part of Chris Patten's reforms, Hong Kong has 
chosen to back its Governor in standing up to Beijing. How far 
that defiance will go remains to be seen. It is quite possible 
that the councillors will choose to amend the second, more 
controversial, part, in particular an extension of the franchise 
in the functional constituencies, comprising members of 
different professions and trades. However, whether they tone 
down Mr Patten's proposals or not, the rupture between the 
British and Chinese governments seems complete. Beijing's 
threat to disband the Legislative Council when it takes over in 
1997 -- first made at the end of last year -- has been 
reiterated in the wake of Wednesday's LegCo vote. The goal of a 
smooth transition from British to Chinese sovereignty, one of 
the main aims of the 1984 Joint Declaration, is receding to 
vanishing point. Failure to attain it will mark a signal 
failure in the policy of each country. 
  The political arrangements for Hong Kong having apparently 
reached an impasse, there will be a rush to judgment. Writing 
on the facing page, George Walden ascribes the lion's share of 
blame to the British Government for believing that it was ever 
possible "to have anything approaching serious democracy in Hong 
Kong." Yet it seemed vital to some ministers and some 
passionate democrats in Britain, following the Joint 
Declaration, that the colony should seek to establish a 
distinctive political identity before it was handed back to 
China. That document spoke of a Special Administrative Region 
with "a high degree of autonomy" and a legislature "constituted 
by elections." The tactics which Britain has used to define 
this new identity are open to criticism. But it should not be 
forgotten that Mr Patten's plan for a limited extension of 
democracy has enjoyed wide support among the people of Hong 
Kong; and that it is they, through LegCo, who will decide its 
fate. 
  The breakdown of relations between London and Beijing over 
Hong Kong need not cast too dark a shadow over the future of the 
colony. The economy of southern China, in which it plays an 
irreplaceable role as entrepot and capital market, is booming. 
Continued prosperity in the coastal provinces of Guangdong and 
Fujian is essential to the growth of China as a whole. Without 
such growth, the Communist Party will lose its sole remaining 
claim to legitimacy. A second cause for optimism is the example 
which Beijing will set over Hong Kong for the much greater task 
of reunification with Taiwan. The more drastically it 
intervenes in the first, the more it will encourage the second 
to keep its distance. The next three years will be tense and 
difficult for Hong Kong. But the Taiwanese and economic factors 
may yet enable the colony to pull through to a brighter future 
than Beijing currently threatens.

  [Text] Feb 28 (AFP) -- Leading Western powers united 
Monday [28 February] to defend the downing by two U.S. F-16 
fighter jets of four Bosnian Serb aircraft in central Bosnia 
earlier in the day. 
  The four were part of a group of six Super Galeb aircraft 
which took off from the northwestern Serb-held airport of Banja 
Luka early Monday morning, a French military source said. 
  In Bonn, German Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said that 
the downing of the aircraft was the "bitter but necessary 
consequence" of Serbian aggression. "The (Serbian) pilots had 
not reacted to two warnings given after they clearly infringed 
the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia," Vogel said. 
  In Washington, President Bill Clinton said that the American 
forces had made every attempt to avoid a confrontation with the 
Serbs. "There were two warnings," Clinton told reporters. 
"Every attempt was made to the best of my information to avoid 
this encounter." 
  In Brussels, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said that 
the use of force showed that "the international community has 
decided to make sure it is respected." 
  British Prime Minister John Major, in Washington on an 
official visit, said that the four downed aircraft had shown 
clearly hostile intentions. "The planes had no reason to be 
there, had been warned and should have expected to be shot 
down," Major said. 
  At the French Foreign Ministry, spokeswoman Catherine 
Colonna 
said the Serbian flights over Bosnia "constituted an 
unquestionable violation of United Nations resolutions." It was 
"the first violation of this type" and the "most serious 
violation seen to date," she said, adding: "The international 
community must show its resolve to see that the UN Security 
Council's resolutions are respected." 
  In Rome, Italian Defence Minister Fabio Fabbri said that the 
incident was "painful" but "allowed the United Nations to keep 
its authority and prestige." Fabbri said that the U.S. pilots 
had "operated according to the defined procedures in order to 
see the UN Rsolution 816 on the no-fly exclusion zone was 
respected. "If the international community and the United 
Nations want to make their intention of guaranteeing world order 
credible and influential, they cannot avoid the use of force for 
peaceful and humanitarian ends," he said. 
  In Athens, Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias, current 
president of the European Council of Ministers, said that, 
"disagreeable and difficult as the serious incident was...it 
could not annul" the peace process underway in Bosnia. 
  General Jean Cot, commander of the UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR], said in a statement in Zagreb that the shooting down 
of the four planes was carried out "exactly according to 
procedures. All stages of this operation were executed by NATO 
exactly according to the procedures agreed for the no-fly zone," 
he said. 
  In Tirana, where he was on an official visit, Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman said he was "entirely in accord with" 
the NATO operation by which the international community showed 
"it intends to continue its actions to put an end to the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  In Ankara, a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman said that 
the 
action was entirely "legitimate." 
  In Milan, Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed Kresevliajakovic said that 
"NATO's strength will accelerate the end of the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  In Moscow, extreme nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
demanded the "dissolution" of NATO and the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "First Netherlands Troops Now in </F>
Srebenica"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague/Pretoria -- The Netherlands UN troops 
who have just arrived in the former Yugoslavia are simply 
continuing their journey to their positions in Bosnia. The 
first 120-strong engineering unit arrived in the Srebenica "safe 
area" yesterday evening, the Defense Ministry said. 
  At present there are two other groups of Netherlands 
soldiers 
in Bosnia, in addition to the engineering unit. Eighty percent 
of the 400-strong logistical unit is in Lukavac, some 10 km west 
of Tuzla in central Bosnia. And the first company of the 
airborne brigade, numbering some 200 soldiers, is driving 
through central Bosnia toward Lukavac. 
  Despite the increased tension in Bosnia and increased 
concern 
on the home front, another group of 280 UN troops will leave 
Schiphol airport today for the Croatian harbor town of Split. 
With the arrival of this group, some 1,100 of the total 1,230 
troops in Dutchbat will be in Bosnia this week. 
  The maintenance of the plan to deploy the Netherlanders in 
the Muslim enclaves of Srebenica and Zepa and the logistical 
center in Lukavac is illustrative of the determination of the 
Netherlands Government and Parliament to maintain its commitment 
to the international crisis management operation in the former 
Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] 
  Defense Minister Ter Beek and Foreign Minister Kooijmans 
said 
on Monday [28 February] that the shooting down of the four 
Serbian bombers by NATO fighter aircraft under the Deny Flight 
operation was "logical and inevitable." The parliamentary 
parties also followed the same line. 
  A Defense Ministry spokesman said that Netherlands F-16's 
could have shot down the planes violating the international 
no-fly zone over Bosnia. He said it was chance that two U.S. 
planes were in the vicinity after a U.S. AWACS had detected the 
violation of the ban by six Serbian planes. 
  The Netherlands has 14 F-16's at the Italian Villafranca 
base. They take it in turns to operate in pairs in the Deny 
Flight operation. 
  Ter Beek said that the intervention underlined the fact that 
statements by the international community should be taken 
seriously. "That means that in extreme cases, the use of 
violence is not excluded," he said. Ter Beek cancelled taking 
part in a PvdA [Labor Party] election meeting in The Hague so 
that the crisis team at his ministry could keep him constantly 
informed about the latest developments in Bosnia. 
  Prime Minister Lubbers is in South Africa with Deputy Prime 
Minister Kok and Kooijmans. Lubbers, who said that first of all 
he was shocked by the news that the Serbs had flown fighter 
aircraft over Bosnia for the first time, said in Pretoria he 
agreed with the NATO intervention. He said the line had to be 
drawn somewhere against the Bosnian Serbs. 
  Lubbers said he was concerned about the Netherlands UN 
troops 
in Bosnia. "But I would have been more apprehensive if NATO had 
done nothing," he said. "Then they would have been in even 
greater danger." 
  Kooijmans's thoughts were also with the Netherlands troops 
who at the moment were still en route to Srebenica. "We hope 
with all our hearts that nothing happens," he said. 
  As far as he was aware, it was fairly quiet in their area. 
"There has been shelling in Tuzla," he said. "But it started so 
soon after the planes were shot down that it is not clear 
whether there is a direct connection between the shooting down 
of the planes and the shelling." Therefore, for the time being 
he saw no reason for extra safety measures.

  [Text] Prime Minister John Major said the Bosnian Serb 
combat aircraft could have expected nothing other than to have 
been shot down, writes PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor Chris 
Moncrieff in Washington. 
  Mr. Major spoke out before a breakfast at the British 
Embassy 
in Washington with Warren Christopher, the U.S. Secretary of 
State, and other senior members of the U.S. Administration. 
  He said: "The United Nations passed a Security Council 
resolution very nearly a year ago establishing a no fly zone. 
That no-fly zone was plainly infringed. 
  "There was no reason for these planes to be there. They were 
there with hostile intent. 
  "They were given a warning. They declined that warning. 
They were shot down and frankly they could expect nothing else." 
  As expected, Mr. Major was giving full-hearted support to 
action by U.S. war planes, which are part of the United Nations 
contingent in the region. 
  He will express his support to President Clinton when the 
two 
leaders meet in Pittsburgh later today. 
  There was talk that the incident might cause the President 
to 
cancel a visit he was making to Chicago before meeting the Prime 
Minister, but it seemed he was going ahead with his planned 
programme. 
  The Prime Minister made clear he was 100 percent behind the 
action. The incident is sure to dominate the talks betweeen the 
two leaders. 
  Bill Perry, U.S. Secretary of Defence, who was attending the 
breakfast with the Prime Minister, said: "We have incomplete 
information about precisely what happened." 
  He said six Galeb aircraft were on a bombing mission. 
  "This was in strict violation of the United Nations 
resolution." 
  The NATO air patrol issued a warning, but this was ignored. 
  "The F-16's attacked them and shot down four of the six. 
This is as much information as we have at this time." 
  In London, Tory Peter Viggers, another member of the Commons 
Defence Select Committee, said: "This is exactly the kind of 
measure that could lead to an escalation of the war. We must 
all hope that people remain calm and this does not lead to an 
escalation." 
  Downing Street said the possible ramifications for security 
of British troops would be assessed "on the ground" by the UN 
and NATO. 
  "We are not rushing in with precipitate words at this stage. 
It is far too early after the event," a senior Government 
official said. 
  Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on ITN at lunchtime 
that UN troops in Bosnia were well equipped to defend themselves 
if attacked -- and had authority do so. 
  "The British Government has, as have other Governments, made 
it clear from the begining that if UN forces are fired at, they 
have the right to defend themselves by whatever means is 
appropriate, and that includes using air power," he added.

<F P=106> [Interview with British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in </F>
Northhampton by Jon Snow in London on 28 February -- recorded; 
from the "Channel 4 News" program] 
  [Text] [Snow] Are the airstrikes a one-off or a watershed? 
  [Rifkind] Well, we hope it will be a one-off, because for 
the 
last few months the Bosnian-Serbs have not violated the no-fly 
zone; they have done so for the first time with fixed wing 
aircraft, and they have paid the penalty. I hope they now 
realize this must not be repeated. 
  [Snow] There has been a catalogue of movements that have not 
been entirely satisfactory, but there was something very 
different about this particular incident? 
  [Rifkind] Yes very different, the previous violations have 
been helicopters and it has always been very difficult to tell 
whether helicopters are being used for a civilian or a military 
purpose. What happened today was unique -- [this was] the first 
time fixed wing aircraft [were] being used, actually attacking 
positions on the ground, [with] no room for doubt, no room for 
confusion -- a quite clear violation of the Security Council 
resolution. 
  [Snow] Do you have any intelligence on what may have been 
going on? 
  [Rifkind] We don't have detailed information at this stage. 
It would appear that there was an attack on a ammunition 
factory, and the reports I have heard suggest that that 
ammunition factory might in any event have been within range of 
Serb artillery, so it's not clear what they might have been up 
to. 
  [Snow] Clearly the danger must be that with the heat that's 
being put on the Sarajevo end of things, the Serbs are now 
trying it on elsewhere, and literally trying to test NATO wills 
and UN wills? 
  [Rifkind] Well if that is their motive, then they have 
tested 
and they have found that that resolve was pretty strong, because 
what NATO said would happen has happened. 
  [Snow] Clearly there is a worry though that this will lead 
to 
reprisals against our people on the ground, and indeed the 
necessity for more action in the air? 
  [Rifkind] I think it would be have been more worrying if 
having tested NATO's resolve -- if NATO had been found wanting 
-- that would have simply encouraged not only the Bosnian Serbs, 
but also the other factions in this war to flout the various 
agreements that have been reached. I think that what has been 
most impressive particularly in recent weeks is how the UN and 
NATO have been able to demonstrate that the resolve is indeed 
substantial, and that if the Security Council resolutions are 
ignored, then indeed action follows. 
  [Snow] The chain of command seems to have worked very 
efficiently, I mean, did NATO in fact have to refer to the top 
of the line before doing this? 
  [Rifkind] Well, I am not familiar with the precise details, 
this was a matter for the UN commander, but there is a 
recognized procedure that if there is a violation, then the UN 
commander on the ground is able to ask for action to be taken, 
the NATO commander was able to respond and that is what has 
happened. 
  [Snow] Now as attention switches away from Sarajevo, I mean 
the Tuzla area in particular has been under very heavy pressure 
today, and that involves much more likelihood of British 
activity? 
  [Rifkind] You say more likelihood of British activity -- the 
British area is not in the Tuzla pocket, that is mostly a Nordic 
battalion of Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians who have the primary 
responsibility in Tuzla. 
  [Snow] But on the other hand, we may yet be drawn in from 
Vitez or anywhere else in support, I mean what do we do? 
  [Rifkind] Well you say in support, if there is any attempt 
to 
attack any UN forces, whether they be British or other forces 
then the UN has very powerful military assets at its disposal, 
including of course, as we have seen aircraft, we would not 
hesitate either at the UN level and certainly not at the British 
level in expecting all these military assets including air power 
to be used if it was necessary in the opinion of the local 
commanders to protect the physical safety of their men. 
  [Snow] But given that the prime minister said in the Commons 
last week -- that he hoped to see Tuzla airport open within two 
to three weeks -- this not looking too good, is it? 
  [Rifkind] Well, I think we must wait and see, clearly the 
position today is somewhat confused. I think it should be 
clearer over the 24 hours what is actually happening in the 
Tuzla area. I think what will have been important is that it 
will have been seen very clearly -- not just by the Serbs, but 
also by the Croats, and by the Bosnian-Muslim authorities that 
if the Security Council resolutions are flouted in such a 
substantial way, then that is not something which is treated 
with equanimity, and I think it is quite important that that 
point will now be clearly understood.

Serb aircraft that were flying over Banja Luka. [passage

NATO's intervention. 
  [Begin Balladur recordings] I believe that we had no choice 
but to enforce the resolutions that had been voted. I believe 
too, that it is time for all the parties involved to understand 
that their common interest is the return to peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and more generally in the whole of the former 
Yugoslavia. This is the policy advocated by France. We are one 
of the foreign countries with the largest number of soldiers on 
the ground and we hope that reason will eventually prevail.

resolution on the no-fly zone in Bosnia, Italy's Defense 
Minister Fabio Fabbri said on the downing of the Serbian planes. 
The international community and the UN cannot help using force 
if they want to be credible when they say they want to guarantee

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco </F>
Silva by unidentified correspondent -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] We have in the studio Prime Minister 
Cavaco Silva. If the conflict between NATO and the Serbian 
forces becomes generalized in Bosnia, do you foresee Portugal 
getting involved in NATO actions? 
  [Silva] Portugal has made a limited contribution, about 50 
men, to the humanitarian operations in the region. But I do not 
foresee greater Portuguese involvement in that part of the 
world. However, let us bear in mind that according to UN 
resolutions, flights over Bosnia are banned, so we cannot allow 
the aggressors to try to test the determination of the allies to 
put an end to this Yugoslav tragedy. According to the 
information we have, what happened was that planes, believed to 
be Serbian, entered no-fly zones and NATO planes, with UN 
authorization, opened fire and shot down four planes. It is 
believed that there were six planes -- four were shot down. 
What we have here is a tool to pressure the sides into 
negotiating and into reaching an accord through negotiations. 
  [Announcer] Do you not fear the fact that Portugal's 
noninvolvement in the NATO effort could be wrongly interpreted 
by our allies? 
  [Silva] We cannot forget that Portugal has other 
commitments, 
mainly helping the United Nations with the Mozambican and 
Angolan peace processes. We have concentrated our efforts in 
this area, in the context of the United Nations. Portugal is 
not as well placed as other countries to deploy soldiers in the 
[former] Yugoslavia. I just want to add, as I have said before, 
bombing is a tool to pressure the sides. It is a tactical tool, 
but alone it will not achieve the final objective which is to 
stop the carnage, the tragedy we have all witnessed. What was 
done today, and other pending NATO threats are merely aimed at 
bringing the sides to the negotiating table, to accept an accord 
favorable to peace in the region.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] In Spain, the foreign minister has 
justified the NATO attack. Javier Solana said that the planes 
shot down violated the UN resolutions. Concern is now focused 
on the Spanish troops serving with the United Nations in the 
conflict area. The soldiers and the conscientious objectors are 
well, but on alert awaiting events. The Defense Ministry is in 
permanent contact with the forces in Bosnia and measures have 
been taken to avoid danger. Ana Medina reports: 
  [Medina] [passage omitted] The Spanish forces have continued 
with the tasks of escorting convoys because the Spanish 
positions are in areas controlled by Croats and Muslims, but 
convoys to Serb enclaves are suspended. There is also calm 
among the Spanish conscientious objectors, who are working far 
from the Serb firing line. The Principe de Asturias aircraft 
carrier is on alert at Rota base ready to depart if it is 
considered necessary. The Defense Ministry is in permanent 
contact with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command and the 
Spanish military command in Bosnia. The government supported 
the NATO action in the voice of Foreign Minister Javier Solana, 
who said that although on previous occasions air space had been 
violated, this time there was a special element because the 
intruding aircraft had bombed Bosnian territory: 
  [Begin Solana recording] Yes, this violation had special 
significance and it is a violation, which we consider to be 
important, of a UN resolution. Therefore, there was an emphatic 
action, as you were able to witness this morning. [end recording] 
  [Medina] The United Left, however, has criticized this 
operation which it considers to be an extreme and inopportune 
interpretation of the UN mandate that will not help the process 
of detente that has been achieved. 
  [Announcer] The prime minister has also just spoken about 
the 
latest events in the area. He spoke after visiting the 
president of Argentina, Carlos Menem, in the Pardo Palace 
[Madrid]. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports: 
  [Cespedes] Following the line of the allied heads of 
government, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez says that the NATO 
air attack is, he believes, the strict fulfillment of the UN 
Security Council resolutions: 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] And I hope there will be no more 
violations so there are no incidents that create added tension 
at a time when there was an opening, and there still is, of a 
certain hope for peace in Bosnia after a long time. [end 
recording] 
  [Cespedes] Repercussions following the shooting down of the 
four Serb planes cannot be predicted. To speculate on this 
would be dangerous, although Felipe Gonzalez emphasized that so 
far there had been no negative reaction.

  [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis said 
that he was amazed by the fact that training aircraft were 
downed and added: 
  [Begin Arsenis recording] The only thing I can say is that 
this confirms once again the correctness of the Greek position 
that Greece as well as all the other Balkan countries should not 
participate either directly or indirectly in this activity that 
sometimes results, as it did today, in an open [words 
indistinct] and the downing of aircraft. I am really amazed 
because it was a case of shooting aircraft that are by nature 
training aircraft. [end recording] 
  YEETHA [National Defense General Staff] Chief Admiral 
Khristos Limberis did not rule out the possibility of a mistake 
and stressed that this incident should not be a reason to 
suspend peace talks on Bosnia. Our correspondent Stefanos 
Kasimatis has the following report. 
  [Begin Kasimatis recording] The YEETHA operations staff will 
be in a state of vigilance and readiness to follow developments 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Admiral Khristos Limberis believes the 
incident is not a reason to suspend peace efforts in the region. 
However, the chief of YEETHA does not rule out the possibility 
of a mistake by the U.S. aircraft since the identity of the 
planes shot down remains unclear. At the same time, Admiral 
Limberis noted that there are Galeb planes in Serbia's arsenal 
since they are built in that country and also noted that, 
according to his information, the Serbs in Bosnia have a small 
number of these aircraft. 
  Belgian Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General [name 
indistinct], who is on an official visit to Greece, also made a 
statement on the incident. Despite the difference in emphasis, 
the positions of the Greek and Belgian general staffs coincide 
on the need for a political solution to the Bosnian issue. The 
Belgian lieutenant general said that military action can be used 
only to the extent that it pushes the belligerent sides to 
negotiate. [end recording]

  [Text] Ankara, Feb. 28 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry deputy 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman called the downing of four Serbian 
planes by two U.S. F-16 fighters a "legal action" since they 
violated the United Nations no-fly zone. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday [28 February] that 
NATO jets issued two warnings before shooting down four Serb 
warplanes over Bosnia and said every attempt was made to "avoid 
this encounter." 
  Ataman told the ANATOLIA Agency that Turkey has taken 
initiatives to provide a peaceful, just and lasting solution in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He said Turkey supported all NATO resolutions made toward 
this end and believes that these resolutions should be enforced.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the 
downing of four Serbian planes by NATO over Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is a legitimate act carried out while implementing UN 
resolutions. 
  Cetin, who is in New Zealand, assessed the latest 
developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina for Turkish Radio and 
Television. 
  [Begin Cetin recording] From the beginning, we supported all 
the resolutions made for a lasting and just peace, and we 
believed that these resolutions must be implemented effectively. 
There were reports at a certain stage that not all the heavy 
weapons which were supposed to withdraw 20 kms in line with the 
NATO resolution were under UN control. At the time we warned 
the United Nations and NATO that if these weapons were not 
placed under full UN control they could be used in other places. 
It is now understood that the cease-fire achieved around 
Sarajevo can be violated, and the weapons, unless placed under 
UN control, can be taken to other places. Consequently, in 
order to achieve lasting peace, NATO and the UN Security Council 
must continue with their actions in a determined way. [end

  [Text] Paris, March 1 (AFP) -- The Western European Union 
[WEU] on Monday [28 February] backed NATO's action in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but regretted that Bosnia's Central European 
neighbours had been sidelined in the decision-making which 
mainly involved Washington, Moscow and the UN. 
  The Presidential Committee of the WEU -- the European pillar 
of the Atlantic alliance -- meeting in Paris, praised "NATO's 
resolve" in enforcing the UN-backed no-fly zone over Bosnia and 
the ban on un-policed heavy arms round Sarajevo, according to a 
statement issued after the meeting. 
  However the WEU noted that NATO's 9 February ultimatum to 
withdraw heavy arms threatening Sarajevo or put them under UN 
control "could be implemented only thanks to a tacit agreement 
between Russia and the United States under United Nations 
auspices." 
  But the WEU expressed "regrets" that it was "not possible 
for 
there to be prior consultation with the Central European 
countries whose close cooperation is vital to the conduct of any 
UN policy in former Yugoslavia." 
  The WEU said the "positive development" in Sarajevo should 
encourage efforts to "apply the same policy to other threatened 
areas in Bosnia: Mostar, Srebrenica and Tuzla" amongst others. 
  It said the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
should 
be provided "with sufficient additional troops to enable it to 
carry out its mission of controlling armaments." 
  WEU members and NATO "should make all necessary preparations 
so as to be able to contribute military forces to the 
substantial peace-keeping force that will be required to ensure 
the implementation of a peace agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina," 
the statement said. 
  The WEU groups France, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Britain. 
Denmark and Ireland have observer status.

  [Text] In Geneva, the UN Human Rights Commission special 
rapporteur on Iraq, Max van der Stoel, has presented to the 
Commission his report on the human rights situation in that 
country. He then gave a news conference. From Geneva, Roy 
Brunton. 
  [Brunton] Max van der Stoel has been special rapporteur on 
Iraq for three years. This report, he said, is a landmark. For 
the first time a Commission report has named two individuals and 
accused them of holding, quote, the most responsibility of a 
special and individual nature for serious human rights 
violations, unquote. The two persons named are Iraqi President 
Saddam Husayn and his cousin 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, the minister 
of defense. Both men hold several other positions in the 
hierarchy of power in Iraq. 
  In addition to accusing them of crimes against the peace, 
such as the invasion of Kuwait, the report says that serious 
violations of human rights against the population of Iraq, both 
in times of war and peace, involved crimes against humanity 
committed under and pursuant to their orders. As an example it 
cites the use of chemical weapons against numerous Kurdish 
communities in northern Iraq. 
  Max van der Stoel was asked whether he thought President 
Saddam Husayn ultimately should stand trial for crimes against 
humanity. 
  [Begin van der Stoel recording] One thing is clear, that is 
the responsibility, that the concentration of power is such that 
there is no decision of any importance for which he doesn't 
(?currently) have direct responsibility. To give you one 
example, in 10 days during the [word indistinct] campaign he 
signed 500 death sentences, so that shows that he has a very 
direct responsibility and the whole structure is such that the 
real power is concentrated in the so-called Revolution Command 
Council, and in the Revolution Command Council President Saddam 
plays the key role and in fact the decisive role. [end 
recording] 
  [Brunton] The report says President Saddam Husayn must be 
considered directly responsible for the Iraqi population's 
present suffering, this due to his refusal to comply with the UN 
Security Council resolution under which Iraq would export oil 
with some of the proceeds being used for purchase of imported 
basic necessities. 
  It also accuses him of being responsible for driving the 
population out of the southern marshes by depriving them of the 
means to sustain themselves as a result of the draining of the 
marshes in which they have lived for generations. 
  Among annexes to the report are copies of official letters 
sent to the authorities as routine. One refers to an illiterate 
nine-year-old girl blamed by officials for subversive activities 
with a warrant issued for her arrest. Another letter concerns 
the killing and decapitation of a mentally retarded man 
described as an Iranian agent. The letter says the squad that 
killed him took his head to the General Directorate of Security. 
Roy Brunton, Geneva.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, Feb 28 (AFP) -- The first attempt by the 
European Union to take in new members since 1986 was heading for 
a Monday midnight [28 February] make-or-break deadline with 
Norway and Austria still balking at EU entry terms. 
  Sweden and Finland appeared ready for compromise on a range 
of issues involving the price of the entry ticket and EU 
concessions on aid for less-developed regions and Arctic farmers. 
  But Norway remained at loggerheads with the EU over its 
refusal to give countries of the Union increased access to its 
fish-rich waters, or to accept limits on its fish exports. 
  And Austria refused to relax restrictions on polluting truck 
traffic across the Austrian Alps. The EU wants them lifted by 
the end of the century, but Austria has insisted that they 
remain in place until 2004. 
  EU ministers were preparing final compromise offers on 
membership terms to put to the four candidates later Monday, 
with Germany, Denmark and Britain urging the Union to compromise. 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel warned that enlargement 
was necessary for Europe's economic and political stability. 
"It would strengthen the EU as an anchor of stability for 
Europe," he said. 
  German diplomats have often stressed the EU's failure to 
absorb the four relatively wealthy applicants would be a poor 
signal to poorer countries next in line for membership, such as 
Poland and Hungary. 
  The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers, 
Theodoros Pangalos, denied that the applicants were being 
confronted Monday by "take-it-or-leave-it" offers. 
  But he warned that candidates which failed to accept 
membership terms by midnight, or at the latest by dawn (0630 
GMT) on Tuesday, would not be able to enter the EU on the target 
date of January 1, 1995. 
  The four applicants are among the richest countries in 
Europe. They all have economies bigger than the EU average. 
  By EU rules, this means they would normally get a 
proportionately smaller share of the Union's agricultural 
support hand-outs, while at the same time paying more than the 
average into the EU budget. 
  The EU has offered to bend its rules to give special support 
for the fragile Alpine and Arctic agriculture, but the applicant 
countries want the Union to go further. 
  But diplomatic activity was concentrated on trying to keep 
Norway and Austria in the talks despite their hard line on fish 
and Alpine pollution. "Our goal is to complete the negotiations 
with the other applicants," Norwegian Trade Minister Greta 
Knudsen told a press conference. 
  But Norwegian Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen made it 
clear Norway was betting on an EU climb-down over fish. 
  He said Norway was not prepared to increase catch quotas for 
foreign fishing boats, but added: "We are ready to continue the 
negotiations." 
  The EU itself was divided over the issue, with Spain, 
Portugal and Ireland pressing for the right to fish in Norwegian 
waters and other countries less willing to let the issue 
sabotage the negotiations. 
  Norway's last attempt to enter the EU, in 1972, foundered 
over the fisheries issue. Kinkel said: "This should not be 
allowed to happen again." 
  There was also little movement on the Alpine trucking issue, 
although the negotiators were said to be searching for a 
face-saving formula which might satisfy the Austrian public that 
anti-pollution standards would not be cut. 
  And the EU was divided over concerns that the applicants 
would tilt the Union's balance of power towards its richer 
countries, and also give the smaller members relatively more 
weight at the expense of the larger ones.

  [Text] Brussels, March 1 (AFP) -- The European Union missed 
its Monday midnight [28 February] deadline to wrap up talks for 
absorbing four new countries, but diplomats reported progress in 
the negotiations which were continuing late into the night. 
  "We hope to see a breakthrough in coming hours," Danish 
Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said as EU negotiators 
bargained with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden over terms 
for their entry into the Union. 
  Diplomats said Brussels was offering the candidate countries 
more money to help merge the highly-subsidised Nordic and Alpine 
agriculture with the lower-cost EU farming system. 
  The EU wants the high farm prices of Austria, Norway and 
Sweden cut to EU levels in one "big bang" on the day when the 
applicant countries join the EU. 
  The candidate countries, being relatively wealthy, will 
contribute a total of about one billion dollars a year more to 
the the EU budget than they will get back in benefits. 
  The diplomats said a large part of this money could be used, 
at least initially, to help the high-cost, difficult-to-farm 
Nordic and Alpine regions. 
  French Minister for European Affairs Alain Lamassoure said 
there had been little progress in one major sticking point -- 
Austria's insistence on keeping strict limits on truck traffic 
across the Austrian Alps until 2004. 
  The restrictions would contravene the EU's freedom of 
movement principle, but diplomats said the EU was likely to back 
down on this point rather than let it torpedo the enlargement 
negotiations. 
  There was also no change in Norway's refusal to allow EU 
fishing fleets increased access to the fish-rich Norwegian 
waters as part of Oslo's price for joining the Union. 
  However, one diplomat said the EU might reach at least the 
outlines of a deal with Austria, Finland and Norway before dawn 
on Tuesday, then give Norway a little more time to consider a 
compromise on the fish issue. 
  Germany and Denmark were fighting to have the four countries 
join the EU together. 
  Lamassoure said the negotiators might delay a decision on 
another dispute -- that the applicants could tilt the EU's 
balance of power towards its richer northern members, and 
increase the influence of its smaller ones. 
  The French minister predicted that the decision, along with 
the dispute over Norwegian fish, might be held over until the 
weekend. 
  The EU had set a Monday midnight deadline to wrap up the 
year-long negotiations so that the membership accords can be 
ratified in time for the applicants to join the EU on January 1 
next year. 
  But officials said the deadline could possibly be stretched 
to March 10, giving Euro-parliamentarians just enough time to 
cement their entry before parliament breaks up in the first week 
in May for Euro-elections in June.

  [Text] Brussels, March 1 (AFP) -- All-night talks to bring 
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the European Union were 
continuing early Tuesday [1 March] but were unlikely to be 
completed before next week, EU diplomats said here. 
  They said that Austria was negotiating a new package on its 
terms of entry into the Union, Finland was also considering a 
new offer. 
  A senior Norwegian official said talks involving Norway had 
been suspended until next week. 
  A senior official of the EU's executive European Commission 
was pessimistic about the chances of an agreement on Tuesday. 
"There has not been enough progress," he said. 
  A spokesman for the EU's Greek presidency said: "We have 
problems still with all four countries." 
  But German and Dutch diplomats said agreement on the terms 
of 
entry into the EU were remote unless the applicants made big 
last-minute concessions. 
  The year-old negotiations were supposed to have been wrapped 
up at midnight Monday night after a final four-day session that 
started on Friday. 
  The officials would not say whether solutions were within 
reach on the major problems still blocking agreement, which 
involve Norwegian fish and truck pollution across the Austrian 
Alps. 
  Austria was insisting on retaining strict limits on truck 
traffic across the Austrian Alps until 2004, which the EU 
maintains would contravene its rules of free movement. 
  Norway was still refusing to allow EU fishing fleets 
increased access to the fish-rich Norwegian waters as part of 
Oslo's price for joining the Union. 
  Finland was holding out for the right to extend aid to all 
its farmers, in contravention of EU agricultural policies. And 
Sweden was pushing for a gradual phase-in of its contributions 
to the EU budget. 
  The negotiators were also expected to delay a decision on 
another dispute -- that the applicants could tilt the EU's 
balance of power towards its richer northern members, and 
increase the influence of its smaller ones. 
  The EU had set the Monday midnight deadline so that 
membership accords could be ratified in time for the applicants 
to join the EU next January 1. But officials said the deadline 
could possibly be stretched to March 10. 
  Germany and Denmark were fighting to have the four countries 
join the EU together, rather than leave Norway and possibly 
Austria out of the initial enlargement.

  [Text] Finland and apparently also the other countries 
seeking membership in the European Union [EU] are still trying 
to bring about a solution in the EU negotiations. An hour ago 
the Finnish delegation met the EU representatives, who are due 
to convene any minute now. Overall, the situation in Brussels 
is really confusing. At about 0800 it was still being indicated 
that extra time would be allowed for the membership talks. It 
was said that the talks have been suspended and are due to be 
continued in a week's time. 
  After long and difficult negotiations, the candidate members 
and the EU have not been able to reach an understanding. 
Greece, the current EU chairman, had already announced in the 
early hours the EU is seeking to reach agreement with each 
candidate member in parallel. 
  The Finnish EU negotiating delegation has announced that, 
unless the situation clarifies in the morning, the negotiators 
will have no other option but to return home. The Finnish 
attitude to the situation is not yet known. At about midnight, 
empowered by the government, Finland put forward a new 
negotiation offer to the EU. In this offer Finland compromised 
somewhat on its original demands. The EU rejected the offer and 
the government, which had convened in Helsinki, dispersed. The 
Finnish Government has just met to receive the latest 
information about the negotiations in Brussels. The government 
is studying the situation at the EU membership negotiations in 
the Council of State banqueting suite.

Norway, into the Union on January 1, 1995. 
  Sweden was pushing for a gradual phase-in of its

  [Text] The European Union [EU] negotiations have been 
completed. We are going over direct to our reporter at the 
negotiations headquarters in Brussels. 
  [Reporter] Well, here in what is called the Charlemagne 
building at the EU headquarters in Brussels, confirmation has 
come from several EU countries that Sweden has reached an 
agreement with the EU in the membership negotiations. There has 
been no confirmation from the Swedish side. We have not seen 
any Swedes since these reports came out about 15-20 minutes ago. 
After a near collapse of the negotiations this morning, Sweden 
has returned to the talks and solved the last issues concerning 
farming and the budget. 
  So far there are a few details, very few, and they are that, 
as far as the milk quotas -- which have been a big issue -- are 
concerned, where Sweden has demanded that it be allowed to 
continue to produce 3.1 million tonnes and the EU has said that 
you are only allowed to produce 3.5 million tonnes [figures as 
heard], the nice compromise of 3.3 million tonnes has been 
reached. 
  As regards the budget solution, that is, how much money 
Sweden is to be refunded in other forms so that the budget costs 
for Sweden are not so tough in the first few years, it appears 
to be roughly of the size spoken of a few days ago, perhaps up 
to 4 billion [currency not specified], (?something like that), 
but it is fairly uncertain so far. 
  The confirmation comes from the EU side -- Sweden has 
accepted an agreement. Norway has in practice gone home and 
will hold negotiations on Monday next week, and on Tuesday the 
ministers will return (?in order to) solve the Norwegian 
problems. As for Finland and Austria, there may still be 
confirmation because Austria is with the Council of Ministers 
right now and Finland will be soon. What appeared to be a total 
collapse or at least a long break in the negotiations for the 
four countries this morning is on its way to being solved. It 
has been solved in such a way that first Sweden accepted and has 
an agreement and it seems very likely that at least one of the 
other countries, probably Finland, will say yes. There are not 
many details, but Sweden has an agreement.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the Federal Government's opinion, 
the peace process in the former Yugoslavia must not be stopped 
by the event over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Government spokesman 
Dieter Vogel said at the federal news conference in Bonn on 
Monday [28 February] that the Federal Government is confident 
"that it will really not be stopped." The four aircraft downed 
by NATO F-16 planes had clearly violated the flight ban imposed 
by the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Vogel stressed that the invading aircraft had been warned 
twice. They ignored the warnings. Only then was were they fired 
on. According to all facts that have become known so far, NATO 
adhered to the instructions and rules that are laid down in UN 
Resolution 816. According to it, all necessary means to 
implement the flight ban are permitted. In this respect, NATO's 
course of action is a "bitter, but necessary and resolute 
conclusion of the behavior of the pilots who were subsequently 
downed," he said. 
  A Defense Ministry spokesman reported that German officers 
had, as usual, been in the AWACS reconnaissance aircraft that 
guided the NATO planes to their operational positions. The 
operation is legally permitted by the Constitutional Court 
ruling of 8 April last year. The ruling covers both 
reconnaissance and the control of the fighter aircraft, it was 
stated.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE/GGD: "Bosnia: Minister Claes Anxious </F>
About Fresh Outbursts of Violence"; as released by Brussels 
BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 28 Feb (BELGA) -- On Monday afternoon [28 
February], Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes expressed his 
anxiety in the light of the fresh outbursts of violence seen 
throughout Bosnia since the military intervention of NATO 
aircraft which shot down four machines apparently belonging to 
the Bosnian Serb forces on Monday morning. 
  "I am extremely anxious, not so much about the fact that 
four 
Serbian planes have been shot down, but rather in the light of 
the observations of sudden movements of heavy weapons in (the 
exclusion zone -- BELGA editor's note) within the 20 kilometers 
surrounding Sarajevo, and also following the outburst of renewed 
acts of hostility elsewhere in Bosnia," highlighted the foreign 
minister, speaking on the sidelines of the European Union's 
enlargement talks. 
  Mr. Claes believes it is clear that the aircraft that were 
brought down most definitely belong to the Serbian forces. 
  The minister also confirmed that six or seven tanks 
belonging 
to the Bosnian Serb forces had been moved within the safe area 
surrounding Sarajevo. 
  "Apparently, these arms had not been withdrawn or placed 
under UN control, and had evidently not been registered" by NATO 
forces, added Mr. Claes, giving rise to the suspicion that the 
Serbs might have concealed some of their equipment. 
  "The cease-fire around Sarajevo is imperilled once again, 
but 
I think that the international community must surely be capable 
of preventing the situation from deteriorating," continued the 
foreign minister. 
  "However, I am less fearful of an escalation of violence in 
Sarajevo than in other regions of Bosnia," he concluded.

  [Text] Brussels, 28 Feb (BELGA) -- The additional 150 
Belgian UN troops sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina will be stationed 
in the region of Vitez (in central Bosnia, 45 kilometers 
northwest of Sarajevo) confirmed a military source on Monday 
night [28 February]. 
  The precise location of their camp has not yet been decided, 
added a spokesman for the Defense Ministry. 
  Around 100 Belgian troops are already based in Vitez. They 
belong to a transport company (comprising 102 men) entrusted 
with getting humanitarian aid through to the civilian 
population. This company is part of the Belgian-Netherlands 
battalion. The troops have dubbed the present operation "Moving 
Star." 
  The armored infantry company sent from Croatia as 
reinforcements will participate in monitoring the cease-fire 
agreement concluded last Wednesday between the Croats and the 
Muslims, which provides for the deployment of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] troops along a front line 350-km long. In 
the area around Vitez, the fighting had involved Muslims and 
Croats.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- The IG-Metall trade union has once 
again tightened the screw of warning strikes. A record number 
of 300,000 working people of the west German metal and 
electrical industry participated in brief warning strikes on 
Thursday [24 February] -- five days before the strike ballot on 
a regular strike in Lower Saxony. The trade union had called 
for an "action day" so as to demonstrate once again its 
readiness to fight. On Wednesday 183,000 metal workers had gone 
on strike. 
  In North Rhine-Westphalia, the trade union had 130,000 metal 
workers take to the street, as it reported. Speaking to rally 
participants in Remscheid, IG-Metall chief Klaus Zwickel called 
for the "red card" for the "nay-sayers in pinstripe suits." The 
strike concept stands, Zwickel stressed. In Baden-Wuerttemberg 
about 54,000 metal workers went on temporary strikes, in Bavaria 
35,000. 
  Dieter Hundt, the leader of the employers in the 
negotiations 
for Northern Wuerttemberg/Northern Baden, stressed that the 
employers will not give in. On Wednesday evening in Stuttgart 
he did not leave any doubt that in case of a strike in Lower 
Saxony, which might begin on 7 March, the employers will react 
with lock-outs. Then there might be "cold" lock-outs in the 
southwest, Hundt said. In this area there are companies that 
depend on supplies from Lower Saxony. 
  Dieter Kirchner, main manager of the Gesamtmetall employers' 
association, accused IG-Metall of having falsely claimed that 
the employers want to abolish the vacation bonus and reduce 
incomes. "It is correct that there must be cutbacks in the 
vacation bonus so that the companies can get out of the cost 
crisis and jobs become more secure," Kirchner said. After all, 
Gesamtmetall does not want a general reintroduction of the 
40-hour work week, either, but a regulation with which 
individual branches, such as research, development, sales, and 
customers' service, "may regularly work more than 36 hours per 
week." 
  The trade union, on the other hand, demands up to 6 percent 
higher wages. However, it is willing to tone down its demands 
if measures to ensure employment are taken. 
  This morning about 10,000 employees in the Opel works in 
Ruesselsheim closed down production for about one hour. At a 
rally in front of the company gate, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, 
deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, 
assured the employees that if her party wins the election it 
will make sure that the old strike article 116 is again put into 
the Labor Promotion Law. This would deprive the employers of 
the possibility of a "cold lock-out." Nowadays companies can 
send their employees home without payment if they have to stop 
or reduce their production because of a lack of supplies due to 
a strike. 
  In Saxony several thousand working people expressed 
solidarity with their colleagues in western Germany. At the 
same time, they protested against the hesitant behavior of the 
Association of Saxony's Metal and Electrical Industry concerning 
the still lacking transfer of the Bavarian framework wage 
contract to the wage area of Saxony.

  [Excerpts] Hamburg (DPA) -- On Tuesday [1 March], the 
trade unions in the public services have strongly extended their 
federal warning strikes. According to the Union of Public 
Services, Transport, and Communications Workers (OeTV), in 
Berlin alone some 100,000 employees participated in the protest 
actions. According to OeTV's headquarters in Stuttgart, some 
50,000 employees in the public services participated in the 
token strikes on the previous day. The warning strikes are 
intended to exert pressure on employers to present an offer in 
the next round of talks on 9 March. 
  In Berlin and the Brandenburg capital Potsdam the warning 
strikes widely paralyzed public transport on Monday morning. 
[passage omitted] 
  In Lower Saxony, the trade unions appealed to some 10,000 
employees in the public service to down tools. In the metal and 
engineering industry of the land, the ballot whether to stage a 
regular strike started with the early shift. Almost 50,000 
organized metal workers in 230 enterprises will be asked to cast 
their vote by Thursday. A possible job action has to be 
supported by 75 percent. 
  Representatives of the IG Metall trade union once more said 
that they expected an "overwhelming" majority to vote in favor 
of a strike. The employers have meanwhile emphasized their 
readiness to return to the negotiating table immediately. Klaus 
Murmann, president of the Federal Association of German 
Employers' Association, has warned that a strike would destroy 
the basis for economic recovery. Those who now go on strike do 
not only put their own jobs at risk but make the creation of new 
jobs in the new laender more difficult, Murmann said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] has reacted with unusually 
drastic words to the resolutions adopted by the general assembly 
of Alliance 90/The Greens at the weekend. Federal Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl described the results as alarming and warned the 
Social Democratic Party [SPD] against entering into a coalition 
with that party. A coalition between the SPD and the Greens at 
the federal level would have "devastating effects on Germany, 
both in terms of domestic and foreign policy." 
  With their radical slogans and positions the party would 
destroy any hopes for economic upswing if it were to participate 
in the government. "Foreign investors would be deterred and 
internal security no longer be guaranteed," Kohl said in his 
statement. Thus, for the first time directly commenting on the 
results of a Greens Congress. In terms of foreign and security 
policy, the radical course of Alliance 90/The Greens would 
"drive Germany into isolation and constitute the end of the 
political union of Europe and of our alliance with the United 
States," Kohl said. 
  Kohl called on the SPD "to answer with absolute clarity the 
question whether it was seeking a coalition with the Greens at 
the federal level, too." The CDU will force the SPD "to finally 
answer the coalition question." In Stuttgart, CDU Secretary 
General Peter Hintze made a similar statement: "Alliance 90/The 
Greens are a danger for Germany." 
  The spokeswoman for Alliance 90/The Greens, Anne Nilges, 
commented on Kohl's statement in the following way: "The more 
enemies, the greater the honor." That Kohl, for the first time, 
personally discussed the results of a Greens Congress shows how 
serious the party is now taken even in the opponent's camp. 
"Kohl is afraid of a change in the government," Nilges said. 
  Before, the spokeswoman for executive committee of the 
Alliance 90/The Greens, Marianne Birthler, rejected the 
criticism especially of the security-policy resolutions adopted 
by the congress in Mannheim. "Nobody demanded that NATO 
disintegrate into thin air immediately," she said on 
Deutschlandradio on Monday. The Greens are interested in the 
creation of structures of joint security, for the benefit of 
which NATO should be gradually dissolved. "Our program is 
anything else but hostile to responsibility or politics," 
Birthler said. 
  With its resolutions, the party has created a good starting 
position for the election campaign and for coalition talks. 
Even if the SPD was not distancing itself from the offer in 
public, it was now clear that "the cards will be reshuffled in 
the night following the election." Thomas Westphal, chairman of 
the Young Social Democrats, clearly came out in favor of an 
SPD-Greens coalition at the federal level. "Only with them is a 
true social-ecological policy of reform possible," he said on 
Saarland Radio.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by Michel </F>
Colomes and Christian Makarian; place and date not given: "We 
Know That the Serbs Have Transferred Their More Recent Equipment 
to Other Areas"] 
  [Text] [LE POINT] Are you still satisfied with the 
ultimatum and its impact? 
  [Leotard] We can be satisfied. We had a specific objective 
limited to Sarajevo, with requirements we set and which are 
currently being met. However, this result is not enough. Other 
objectives remain to be achieved. First of all, the siege must 
be lifted. It must be possible to enter and exit Sarajevo 
freely, and humanitarian convoys must be able to enter the city 
as a matter of course. France has just submitted a new 
resolution to the Security Council. 
  Then, unfortunately, there is more to the crisis than just 
Sarajevo. We must enforce the resolutions already passed -- 
there are 49 of them! 
  [LE POINT] Are you not worried about the risk of seeing the 
Serbs transferring to other fronts the equipment they have 
withdrawn from Sarajevo? 
  [Leotard] This is not a risk, it is a fact. Information in 
our possession shows that the equipment placed under UN control 
is rather old, while equipment withdrawn beyond the 20 kilometer 
interdiction zone, as well as that concentrated in the Pale 
area, is much more recent and powerful. This is precisely why 
we must now turn to other enclaves, which are besieged by Serbs, 
Bosnians, or Croats. 
  [LE POINT] The reopening of Tuzla airport is your next 
objective, with a deadline set for 18 March. But do you have 
enough men to achieve this? 
  [Leotard] Personnel is a problem throughout the former 
Yugoslavia. The UN secretary general has been asking for 
additional forces for months. Enforcing a peace plan will 
require several ten thousand men. For example, we now control 
around Sarajevo a zone which went from roughly 1,200 square km 
to 13,000 square km. Mere arithmetical thinking would tell us 
that we therefore need 10 times as many men. This is far from 
being the case. Thus we deployed four French helicopters from 
the Split detachment; they are able to go from one hill to the 
next, and therefore to greatly increase Blue Helmet intervention 
and prevention capabilities. While it has decided not to send 
in more troops, France proposes a different arrangement in the 
field, such as transferring an additional French battalion from 
Bihac to Sarajevo, for example. 
  [LE POINT] Can we hope to see the Americans taking part in 
this effort? 
  [Leotard] We certainly hope so. But at the same time, we 
must also point out that there are American soldiers in the air, 
American soldiers in the Adriatic, American pilots in Italy, 
American foot soldiers in Macedonia, American doctors in Zagreb. 
What is missing is the most important element: foot soldiers 
in Bosnia. We also need to bear in mind that Washington 
promised to send an infantry contingent as a contribution to 
enforcing a potential peace settlement. On this issue, I would 
also like to add that if every European country made the same 
effort as France has, we would have all the human capacity we 
need. France said so at the latest European Council in 
Copenhagen, but we could not make ourselves heard. This is a 
worrisome tendency on the part of Europe, which does not view 
this crisis as one that can be dealt with primarily and 
essentially by the Europeans. 
  [LE POINT] You have just released a White Paper on French 
defense for the next 20 years which opens a debate on what the 
missions of the French Armed Forces should be. Traditionally, 
such missions are presented as consisting of three circles. 
First circle: Europe and Central Europe, where all our forces 
would be engaged. Second circle: external actions, for 
instance in the Mediterranean. Third circle: more specific 
missions overseas, for instance in Africa and in overseas 
territories. Can we retain all three mandates? 
  [Leotard] To these three purely geographic approaches, we 
have substituted a definition of our defense policy objectives 
which combines permanent and innovative objectives. First 
objective: To defend France's interests. Its vital interests 
such as the national territory, its sovereignty. Its strategic 
interests, such as our supply routes or the balance of forces in 
Europe or in the Mediterranean. And its interests as a world 
power, its interests as they relate to its rank, its 
international responsibilities, its status as permanent member 
of the Security Council. Second objective: To build a European 
defense system and to contribute to world security, as our 
borders are no longer our first line of defense. Third 
objective: To implement a global defense concept, not only in 
military terms, but also in terms of how we view the nation, 
with our values, with those of the Republic and democracy. 
  Do we have the means to continue meeting all these 
responsibilities? I believe we must do what it takes to have 
them. Obviously, there are limitations, but we have the 
capability to intervene anywhere in the world should it become 
necessary. The issue of the necessary means is raised in the 
White Paper. We answer it both by developing intervention 
scenarios for French forces and by emphasizing -- this is a way 
to be rational -- the probable multinational nature of most 
future interventions. As part of Europe, of course, with our 
allies, as is currently being done in Bosnia, as was done in 
Cambodia and Somalia. For our interests as a world power, I 
used the word multilateralization. We have no problem with the 
fact that such interests must nowadays be expressed on a 
European scale. 
  [LE POINT] How do you reconcile what you call 
multilateralization and the protection of the national territory 
through [nuclear] deterrence? 
  [Leotard] We do not believe in sharing atomic weapons at 
this point. This is an issue that must remain under national 
jurisdiction as it affects our vital interests. On the other 
hand, with the exception of nuclear matters, it is very 
important that we look into multilateral or multinational 
actions, especially with our German friends, in view of 
potential future crises. 
  [LE POINT] Speaking of nuclear deterrence: Can we remain 
credible without resuming testing? 
  [Leotard] I would give a two-part answer to your question. 
First, France's current deterrent is totally relevant, totally 
reliable, and, I might add, completely at the level of those of 
other world powers, and this will remain true for quite a while. 
Second, there is the issue of the renewal of today's weapons, 
which must take place from the years 2005, 2007, 2010 onward, 
depending on weapon types. To ensure such renewal, the next 
president of the Republic will certainly need to be in a 
position to authorize new tests if we are to maintain our 
credibility into the third millennium and if we want to acquire 
the simulation capability we need -- a capability which in 
itself requires testing. The question is not whether we should, 
but when we need to resume testing. 
  [LE POINT] Do we not need to cross the Rubicon and trade 
conscription for a professional army? 
  [Leotard] I believe that we both need to work toward a 
number of professional units and to maintain the national 
service. This is why the 1994 budget provides for the creation 
of 1,000 additional jobs in the army. We also put a stop to 
personnel cuts, which is in sharp contrast with the 40,000 
military jobs suppressed over the last two years. We do not 
question the need for a national service. First of all because a 
country such as ours, with real integration problems, cannot 
underestimate an integration tool such as the national service. 
I should add that given the missions we must carry out today, 
our Armed Forces need the current numbers of conscripts. In 
other words, contrary to a widespread idea, switching from 
conscription to a professional army would be highly problematic. 
First of all because it would substantially deplete the Armed 
Forces' human resources. Conscripts are far from being the army 
valets we hear about; they fulfil many highly important and 
technologically useful functions with high added value. And 
second, external operations such as the ones being conducted in 
the former Yugoslavia involve 40 percent of conscripts. This is 
therefore a choice to be made at the national level. Besides, 
during the Gulf War, when it was decided not to send any 
conscripts -- a decision I personally regret -- the Armed Forces 
did not take kindly to this situation. I would really like the 
country to accept this idea that it is the people itself which 
defends not only its territory, but also a number of values. 
And not just people who are paid to do it. This is a real 
debate, and I totally accept the political risks, knowing that 
in the majority there are a number of people whose opinions 
differ from mine.

<F P=106> ["L.B." report: "Spain Supports European Union's Enlargement </F>
1 January 1995"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- "We want enlargement to take place on 
the scheduled date, but we also want the Community's heritage 
[acervo comunitario] to be respected," Secretary of State for 
Europe Carlos Westendorp asserted yesterday, during a break in 
the EU Council of Ministers meeting at which the entry of 
Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway was being discussed. 
  These four countries' membership negotiations yesterday 
entered their decisive stage, whose deadline is midnight on 28 
February; a time limit which enables the membership treaties to 
be debated and approved in the European Parliament before the 
June elections and the new partners to join 1 January 1995, if 
the referendums in each of the countries produce favorable 
results. 
<H5>  Reservations </H5>
  Westendorp's statements in favor of enlargement and the 
scheduled timetable come at the very moment when Spain is 
attracting the four applicants' greatest attention because of 
its supposed obstructionist attitude to the membership process. 
It is no secret that Spain is the country which has 
reservations about the greatest number of areas in the 
negotiations. 
  The Spanish Government has unsatisfied demands in the areas 
of fisheries -- in which Norway does not wish to yield "even one 
sardine" -- regional aid, the Community budget, the distribution 
of votes in the Council of Ministers, and the quantification of 
the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union. 
  In fact, Westendorp rejected the new proposal on regional 
aid 
presented by the Commission yesterday. This proposal is to 
create a new classification for areas with a density of 
population below 7 percent, so that the arctic and subarctic 
regions can receive structural funds. These regions would be 
classified as Objective 1A, instead of the previous proposal to 
classify them as Objective 1, which includes the regions which 
have incomes totaling 75 percent of the Union average. 
  Senior Spanish officials who took part in the membership 
negotiations also complain with some bitterness about the 
difference in treatment which the four new applicants and their 
skeptical publics are receiving, as compared with that which 
Spain received. 
  According to these views, Spain found itself forced to 
adjust 
many sectors to Community conditions and to accept transitional 
periods for its fisheries and agriculture, while the four 
applicants are negotiating advantageous positions in almost all 
sectors, to the extent of endangering the very idea of the 
Community's heritage. "It seems that it is we who are going to 
join them -- not vice versa," a Spanish negotiator asserted.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mario Segni, Pact for Italy </F>
leader, by Mauro Anselmo; place and date not given: "Mariotto: 
`I Shall Not Stop, I Am David Against Goliath'"] 
  [Text] [Anselmo] Deputy Segni, how has this happened? The 
Pact for Italy cannot get its candidates presented? 
  [Segni] I heard 10 minutes ago; yours is the first phone 
call 
that I have received. It all strikes me as absurd, and I feel 
very embittered. But anger will not blind me. We shall go 
ahead and fight. 
  [Anselmo] It all strikes you as absurd? First, the Pact for 
Italy, your pact, was unable to collect enough signatures for 
the proportional list in eight constituencies. Then, yesterday 
evening, the final blow: The Court of Appeals in Rome has 
rejected your whole list of candidates for the Lazio region. Is 
this not a knockout? 
  [Segni] I will not allow you to use that term. We are alive 
and well, and I assure you we have a great will to fight. Of 
course, things have been happening that I did not expect, 
baffling things that leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Mistakes 
have been made? We shall appeal. The Court of Appeal will 
think again; these mishaps will not stop us. 
  [Anselmo] You talk about "mishaps." Do you think there is 
political maneuvering against you? 
  [Segni] It is too early to tell, but I know one thing for 
sure: In this campaign we are David challenging Goliath. We are 
the ones with clean faces. You see, we do not have the old 
parties to back us, we do not have the billions, the support of 
the public and private television corporations, we cannot set 
the bureaucratic machinery of the system in motion. We are new. 
Do you know what that means? To put it in a nutshell, we have 
no godfathers, and we work on our own. 
  [Anselmo] But a movement running for government cannot let 
itself be excluded from the Senate list in a region like 
Lazio.... 
  [Segni] I would not overdramatize the situation. As far as 
Lazio is concerned, I believe there is a formal flaw that can be 
put right on appeal. The main thing is not to get into a flap. 
Our political proposals are good ones, and we cannot, now of 
all times, let ourselves be thrown by obstacles that, from 
certain points of view, were perhaps even foreseeable. 
  [Anselmo] Why were they foreseeable? 
  [Segni] I told you: Because the Pact for Italy is made up of 
volunteers and is not a party like the others, which have an 
organizational network covering the whole country. No need to 
worry there: They make no mistakes; their bureaucrats have 40 
years' training. 
  [Anselmo] But what happened in Lazio? Were mistakes made, 
were there irregularities in the collection of the signatures? 
  [Segni] I am waiting to hear the reasons given by the Court 
of Appeals. But the situation in itself strikes me as strange, 
very strange. To be quite honest, I cannot think of an 
explanation. 
  [Anselmo] How ever did you fail to collect enough signatures 
for the proportional list in eight out of the 26 constituencies? 
  [Segni] The reason is very simple: Because in some regions 
our friends did not make it. 
  [Anselmo] Not because you had taken too long to draw up the 
lists and to agree on the names? 
  [Segni] In some cases 2,000 signatures had to be collected 
in 
two days. 
  [Anselmo] But could you not have started earlier? 
  [Segni] The delay in drawing up the lists undoubtedly had a 
detrimental effect, but there was another factor that placed a 
great handicap on us as well. 
  [Anselmo] What was that? 
  [Segni] The present electoral system, which has kept the 
proportional element alive, preserving the parties with their 
rules, their alchemistic practices, their wrangling over places 
and seats. 
  [Anselmo] But Deputy Segni, were you not the champion of the 
referenda, the man who collected the signatures that launched 
institutional reform? How can you, of all people, fall down now 
on this very terrain? 
  [Segni] Because David is not as big, powerful, and organized 
as Goliath. 
  [Anselmo] You had launched the battle cry of a million 
signatures before the election. How many have you collected? 
  [Segni] As of now, I am not in a position to tell you, but 
the figure is very high. 
  [Anselmo] Deputy Segni, what will you do tomorrow? 
  [Segni] I have worked hard to build up this political 
prospect for Italy and I am here, like David, waiting for the 
giant with my sling. 
  [Anselmo] What giant? 
  [Segni] The Right, which is trying to hold the League and 
the 
fascists together, and the left, which, with the Communist 
Renewal party, is presenting itself with its usual mask.

<F P=106> [Fernando Proietti report: "Dissidents' `Furious' Anger With </F>
La Malfa: You Are Playing Dirty"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "What is so shocking? If someone stands as 
a candidate with another party he is already out of the PRI 
[Italian Republican Party]. It is purely a political matter, 
not a matter of issuing official documents to expel someone who 
has chosen a path different from ours. It is something else 
that is shocking -- the exploitation of the good faith of the 
PRI's traditional voters to gather signatures for the rival 
Democratic Alliance [AD] list. This cartel -- merely electoral, 
and lacking a serious program -- is headed by former PCI 
[Italian Communist Party] leader Achille Occhetto, who has 
allied again for this purpose with the hard-liners of Communist 
Renewal, no less. People who still idealize Cuba, who want to 
tax government stock, and who in foreign policy still think as 
though the Berlin Wall had never come down." 
  Giorgio La Malfa made it clear that he does not at all 
regret 
having used the epithets "traitor" and "sold out to the enemy" 
of a major sector of the old Republican nobility. The very 
sector of the old nomenklatura that is planning to contest the 
coming general election under the rival AD banner. But the PRI 
secretary, at least for the present, does not seem to intend to 
make a technical issue of it, that is, by having the court of 
arbitration consider the issue of "expelling" from the party 
Visentini, Bogi, Ayala ("But I was never a member..."), 
Gualtieri, Passigli, Sgarbati, Ugolini, Modigliani, and all the 
other rebels who have gone over to the enemy camp. 
  "This, partly because the court of arbitration is an 
ineffective weapon, which La Malfa himself blunted by reducing 
the body's role," Paolo Ungari pointed out scathingly. 
Certainly, the day after La Malfa vented his anger, though 
impenitent, he admitted that he had "allowed himself to be led" 
in his fierce attacks on the traitors. This ugly business among 
the Republicans -- accompanied by insults from the crowd and 
fierce attacks by the secretary on Senator Gualtieri and company 
-- came to a head Sunday morning at a movie theater in Forli, 
the PRI's traditional stronghold, under military occupation by a 
large and compact group of rebel candidates -- Gualtieri, Ayala, 
and Ugolini. 
  "We are still at the stage of `I have a family behind me,' 
as 
Leo Longanesi used to say. So if Gualtieri is not elected as a 
deputy, thanks to the generosity of the PDS [Democratic Party of 
the Left], he may still be able to become chairman of ARCI-Gay 
[Italian Cultural and Recreational Association gay branch]," La 
Malfa permitted himself to say, addressing the outgoing chairman 
of the Atrocities Committee. La Malfa himself, the resurrected 
son of Ugo, after a long and troubled political dance -- first 
at arm's length with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi and then 
arm-in-arm with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [PDS 
Secretary] Occhetto -- decided instead to bring the PRI back to 
the center of the political system. This decision split the PRI 
in two at the end of a National Council session which, in terms 
of insults and rifts -- including at the personal level -- acted 
as a prelude to Giorgio II's latest Rome shindig. 
  "We know that La Malfa was capable of playing dirty. He 
proved it at Forli," the rebel Gualtieri replied yesterday, with 
equal asperity. He went on: "However, it is not I who am the 
victim of the accusations, despite the coarse nature of the 
attack; it is the party, already deeply wounded by his conduct 
and irregularities. It makes me very sad," Gualtieri concluded, 
"to see how someone such as he can bring division and hatred 
among the Republicans after having damaged their image and their 
name by allying with the corrupters of Italian politics." 
  Casini, formerly of the DC's [Christian Democratic Party] 
Forlani faction, provided unexpected backing for Gualtieri: "La 
Malfa's remarks are so coarse as to prompt my full solidarity." 
But though the new "Berlusconite" is extending a proffered hand 
to the rebel Gualtieri, there are still those within the PRI who 
point to the difference of attitude and conduct between Casini 
and Gualtieri: "Casini left the DC, saying that it disgusted 
him, and eventually he did leave, albeit slamming the door 
behind him. Gualtieri, however, still remains within the PRI, 
even though its policy line disgusts him. But conscience will 
never permit action against the party -- and here La Malfa is 
entirely in the right."

<F P=106> [Interview with Giorgio Napolitano, Italian lower house </F>
speaker, by Paolo Franchi; place and date not given: "`Do Not 
Superimpose Politics on Justice'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "The constant succession of political 
polemics and judicial affairs is spurious and devious." 
  Giorgio Napolitano -- speaker of the lower house and the 
progressive forces' candidate for Naples -- is worried, and is 
not concealing the fact: "Throughout the legislative term 
parliament has worked hard to support the course of justice, 
helping to establish judicially significant responsibilities. 
This, without violating the guarantees provided to defend both 
the function of parliament and the citizens, and without 
neglecting the need -- in order to begin a new phase in the life 
of the Republic -- for reforms that can come only from 
parliament and obviously not from the judicial authorities. 
Whether or not we have been successful in this endeavor may be 
a matter for discussion, but political and judicial 
considerations must not be confused." 
  [Franchi] The fact is that nobody seems to be very clear 
about how to avert this danger of superimposition.... 
  [Napolitano] In order to guarantee the proper and calm 
conduct of the election campaign there must be a great sense of 
responsibility and restraint on the part of all the state 
authorities and bodies. But confusion is often also avoided by 
clarifying matters. 
  [Franchi] You are talking about the media. The only thing 
that cannot be demanded of them is not to provide information, 
however. 
  [Napolitano] Yes. But it is extraordinary, for instance, 
that the existence of the so-called register of investigatees 
was discovered only a few months ago and that there has been no 
explanation of what it is. 
  [Franchi] Have you formed an idea of the reason for this 
"discovery?" 
  [Napolitano] I think that since the abolition of the 
application for authority to proceed in the case of deputies and 
senators, with the reform of parliamentary immunity -- and we 
are well aware of how newsworthy every such request was -- its 
place as a piece of sensational news has been taken over by 
disclosures about inclusion on the register. This is irregular: 
That register, which the penal code significantly assigns for 
information about crimes and not investigatees, automatically 
includes names of persons who subsequently may very well not 
receive the notice of investigation which, however, used to be 
the precondition for authorization to proceed. Therefore, a 
category of suspicion that was already quite inevitably 
associated with the first official stage of an investigation has 
been brought forward to an entirely primal level. 
  [Franchi] Did you know that it is rumored that your name too 
is included on the register in Naples? 
  [Napolitano] I did not know, and it does not interest me. In 
any case, the penal code forbids any communications in this 
regard. I only know that I have initiated proceedings for 
slander against a certain Mr. Greco for the ridiculous 
fabrications that he apparently presented to the magistrate who 
questioned him, and that were denied by Deputy Pomicino, whom he 
himself cited as his source. 
  [Franchi] Leaving judicial initiatives aside, are you not 
aware of a sense of disappointment among the public? Is this 
really the advance of the New? 
  [Napolitano] Innovation does not happen overnight; an 
electoral reform -- even the best -- does not produce its 
positive effects immediately. What were, and what are, people's 
aspirations? On the one hand, openness, political and ethical 
honesty in relations between the institutions and the country, 
between representatives and represented. On the other hand, a 
simplification of the debate before the voters and within the 
elective assemblies, in order to permit greater government 
stability and efficiency. Well, progress is possible in both 
areas, both now and in the near future. But there needs to be 
an effort of reflection and realism on everyone's part. It must 
not be forgotten that until 1992 it proved impossible to produce 
even a corrective measure to the proportional system by 
introducing a threshold. Each political force remained attached 
to its own more or less obsolete identity; its own political, 
cultural, or government stances; resisting any possible 
combination with other forces. 
  [Franchi] Yes. But then came the scalpel of the 
first-past-the-post, single-round, single-candidate system... 
  [Napolitano] ...And we must not be surprised if the 
alignments that this system has caused to be formed more or less 
hastily are proving, to a greater or lesser extent, 
controversial, artificial, and subject to successive 
disruptions. I mean that a first step has been taken: All 
three main alignments display a common denominator, internal 
difficulties, and uncertainties about the future. It will be 
necessary to work patiently and responsibly to keep united that 
which can reasonably unite on the left, on the right, and in the 
center. 
  [Franchi] The single-candidate system was sought for the 
sake 
of selecting a political class having connections with the 
ground, with the voters. Precisely the opposite is happening, 
however -- recycling, the search for safe constituencies... 
  [Napolitano] I am worried by the fact that the political 
forces have not properly understood the rationale of the 
single-candidate system. But this option is destined to endure: 
Other aspects of the electoral system may be revised, but not 
this. It is also extraordinary that, even before the election, 
so many attacks are being made on a reform approved by the 
voters themselves, instead of appreciating all its potential for 
change. 
  [Franchi] I understand that. But there is still a strong 
feeling that many expectations could be disappointed. And it is 
a sense of danger. 
  [Napolitano] This is a traumatic transition -- even chaotic, 
as [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli says -- 
because of the terrible delay with which it was begun. We must 
also understand that everywhere -- from West Europe to the 
United States -- democratic systems are experiencing 
difficulties that are not easy to understand or to control. The 
wind of antipolitics; of intolerance; and of opposition to the 
parties, politicians, and parliament is not blowing in Italy 
alone. And the only democratic response lies in the 
regeneration of political life and of the representative 
assemblies. That is, unless... 
  [Franchi] Unless what? 
  [Napolitano] Unless the voters' choices are well pondered -- 
and this includes the individuals concerned, their qualities, 
and their real suitability for representing and governing. As a 
voter, I would urge candidates standing in my constituency to 
pledge, first, to attend parliament as long as debates and votes 
require. 
  [Franchi] Mr. Speaker, you try to keep out of the fray as 
far 
as possible. But I would remind you that you are competing on 
behalf of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the 
progressive forces. To return to your idea, what could remain 
"reasonably united" on the left after the election? 
  [Napolitano] The demarcation line with the right is very 
clear. I am hoping for a civilized debate also between the 
progressive forces and the "pole for freedoms," but certainly 
all the components of the progressive cartel identify with 
certain major principles. First, the commitment to preserve, 
reappraise, and strengthen social and civil gains, which are the 
fruit of action over several decades on the part of the 
left-wing and progressive forces and which are essential to 
further democratic development. On this basis we can and must 
shoulder all the burdens necessary for the reform of public 
finance, to boost the economy, for reform of the institutions, 
and for the country's social and ethical rebuilding. 
  [Franchi] But it is precisely in these fields that the 
splits 
are occurring. 
  [Napolitano] It would of course be ridiculous to deny or to 
conceal the differences concerning the prospect of government, 
important aspects of economic and financial policy, and even 
foreign policy: Be that as it may, the voters can express their 
preferences for the various stances through their votes for the 
lists for the proportional quota. After the election we will 
see what possible common ground exists on the controversial 
issues. But we will focus on the need to formulate consistent 
and feasible proposals for an alignment that intends to shoulder 
government responsibilities.

Andreatta Says"] 
  [Text] Udine, 26 Feb (ANSA) -- It is unlikely that Forza 
Italia, led by entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi, and the Pact for 
Italy of Christian Democratic renegade Mario Segni will be able 
to join the same coalition government after the March 27-28 
elections, according to Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta. 
  "The way the election campaign has started," Andreatta said 
on Saturday [26 February] in this northeastern city, "an accord 
between Pact for Italy and Forza Italia after March 28 seems 
very unlikely to me." 
  Andreatta, a former Christian Democrat who is not a member 
of 
parliament, is a Pact for Italy candidate for the Lower House, 
running in the northeastern region of Friuli Venezia Giulia. He 
is running for one of the House seats (25 percent of the total) 
to be assigned using the proportional system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Election Campaign Officially Starts, </F>
New Rules"] 
  [Text] Rome, 25 Feb (ANSA) -- The March 27-28 election 
campaign on Friday [25 February] officially took off, with a 
host of new election rules going into effect for the next 30 
days. These are some of the most important among the new rules: 
  As of today, mass media will not be allowed to publish or 
broadcast advertising for parties or candidates but will be 
allowed to announce, broadcast and report on debates, round 
tables, press conferences and speeches, as well as the programs 
of parties and candidates. 
  On Saturday, March 12, (15 days before the polls open), a 
ban 
on the publication or release of any opinion polls or popularity 
ratings will go into effect. 
  An individual campaign spending ceiling of 92 million lire 
(54,700 dollars) has been set for Lower House candidates; the 
spending ceiling for Senate candidates is 115 million lire 
(68,400 dollars). Candidates found to have spent more than twice 
the allotted spending ceiling for their campaigns will face 
removal from office.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Names New, Old And Famous at the </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] Rome, 22 Feb (ANSA) -- A television quiz show 
champion; actors; ex-soccer stars; relatives of famous 
magistrates, industrialists and sports figures; a polemical art 
critic and a controversial photographer; journalists and army 
officers; judges and stylists; discredited members of 
traditional parties striking out on their own: these are some of 
the faces new and old that Italians will see lined up in the 
race for the March 27-28 elections. 
  The first vote to take place under new first-past-the-post 
majority rules, which will assign 75 percent of parliamentary 
seats, last night officially got off to a start when the 
deadline expired for the presentation of candidates. 
  The leading contenders -- the Progressive caucus on the 
left, 
National Alliance on the far right and the ephemeral alliances 
forged by Forza Italia claiming a stake to the center -- will be 
fighting tooth and nail not only against other "big guns" but 
also against a variety of smaller parties not everywhere allied 
in the same fashion, including former Christian Democrats (now 
called People's Party), Pact for Italy, Democratic Alliance, 
secessionists in northern autonomous regions, one-man 
single-issue parties, Communists and Greens, Catholics, 
populists, hard-line Fascists and disguised members of the old 
order. 
  Forza Italia, created by media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, has 
forged an alliance in the north with the League and, in the 
center and south, with National Alliance, both with the goal of 
defeating progressive candidates. 
  But the toughest battles will be fought in a few major 
cities 
considered strategically important for the nation's political 
chess-board: Bologna, Rome, Naples, Milan, Genoa, Venice, 
Florence, Bari, Palermo. 
  Bologna, for decades the power base of the left, has 
attracted all the high-power names attempting to wrest control 
away from the Left Democrats and Communist Refoundation. The 
majority system candidates' list in Constituency 14 in fact 
includes Left Democrat Secretary Achille Occhetto, Ferdinando 
Casini (League-Forza Italia, together with conservative 
Christian Democrats) and the highly controversial advertizing 
wizard and photographer of the Benetton clothing maker, Oliviero 
Toscani (running under the party of former Radical Party leader 
Marco Pannella). 
  Running for votes under the proportional system (for the 
remaining 25 percent of votes) in Bologna will be Socialist 
Party Secretary Ottaviano Del Turco and former Anti-Mafia 
magistrate Giuseppe Ayala (both Progressives). 
  In Bologna's Emilia Romagna region the Progressives will run 
Libero Gualtieri, former chairman of the parliamentary 
investigative commission on the Ustica case, while proportional 
voting will see renowned actor Paolo Villaggio (with Pannella), 
Green MP Gianni Mattioli, Nando Dalla Chiesa (son of the police 
chief murdered by the Mafia in 1982), Northern League leader 
Umberto Bossi, National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini, trade 
union leader Giorgio Benvenuto. 
  Rome, too, has attracted big guns: Budget Minister Luigi 
Spaventa is running with the Progressives against Go Italy 
creator Silvio Berlusconi himself and against Alberto Michelini 
of the so-called Center Pole. Another constituency in the 
capital will see Fini again, against Costanza Pera of the Center 
and Eduardo Missoni of the Progressives. 
  Progressives running under proportional rules in Rome 
include 
Chiara Ingrao, daughter of the former Communist veteran Pietro 
Ingrao, again Giorgio Benvenuto and Social Catholic Alfredo 
Carlo Moro, younger brother of Aldo Moro, the ex-prime minister 
and Christian Democrat leader kidnapped and murdered by the Red 
Brigades in 1978. 
  In Milan, home of the Northern League, Bossi will face off 
against Franco Bassanini of the Left Democrats and former soccer 
champion Gianni Rivera (Pact for Italy). The proportional 
constituencies in neighboring Mantova include former 
anticorruption pool investigating magistrate Tiziana Parenti 
(Forza Italia) and actress Ilaria Occhini (Pannella). 
  Fourteen parties are running for the Senate in Milan, 
including the Party of Natural Law, the Popular Democrats and 
the Robin Hood Justice Movement. 
  Moving down to Naples, where 300 candidates are running 
under 
19 tickets, Lower House Speaker Giorgio Napolitano will try for 
reelection and Franca Chiaromonte, daughter of the Left Democrat 
MP who died last year, will try for election under the 
proportional system. Among the proportional list candidates are 
Education Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino, National Alliance MP 
Alessandra Mussolini (granddaughter of the Fascist dictator), 
Silvio Berlusconi, Ottaviano Del Turco and Marco Pannella. 
  In Sicily, Palermo was the only city to elect Network 
candidate Leoluca Orlando mayor on the first ballot in November. 
There, two former Christian Democrats, Calogero Mannino and Rino 
Nicolosi, are running for the Senate in nearby Agrigento and 
Catania, respectively. 
  In western Sicily Anti-Mafia judge Antonino Caponnetto and 
Alfredo Galasso of the Network will be running, while in eastern 
Sicily former Defense Minister Salvo Ando' has announced he will 
not seek reelection. 
  Two curiosities in Sicily: film director Franco Zeffirelli 
is 
a candidate for Go Italy in Catania, while National Alliance has 
Enzo Majorca, who for decades held the water depth world record 
for unassisted diving. 
  Actor Paolo Villaggio is running under the majority system 
for the Lower House in Genoa, where other candidates vying for 
proportional seats include Lower House deputy speaker Alfredo 
Biondi, former army chief of staff Eugenio Rambaldi (Pact for 
Italy) and the former champion of the television quiz show, 
Rischiatutto, Enzo Bottesini, running as expected with Go Italy. 
  In Tuscany a large number of candidates are journalists but 
include Vittorio Cecchi Gori, president of the Fiorentina soccer 
club (Pact for Italy), the Siena University rector, Luigi 
Berlinguer, Environment Minister Valdo Spini and again Bossi and 
Villaggio. 
  Turin will see among its candidates Mariella Scirea, widow 
of 
the famed soccer star, running with Go Italy, but will also 
include Transport Minister Raffele Costa, Labor Minister Gino 
Giugni, former Environment Minister Carlo Ripa Di Meana and the 
chairman of the Anti-Mafia Commission, Luciano Violante. Then 
there will also be former Defense Minister Valerio Zanone, 
Franco De Benedetti (Progressives), brother of Olivetti Chairman 
Carlo De Benedetti and the president of Azione Cattolica, 
Alberto Monticone. 
  Bari, too, will have a former soccer star, Gianni Rivera 
(Pact for Italy), on its list of candidates, along with Massimo 
D'Alema of the Left Democrat Party and Vittorio Sgarbi (Forza 
Italia), the art critic-turned-political commentator who 
everybody apparently loves to hate. The former Carabinieri 
Police chief Antonio Viesti is also running with the Pact. 
  The southern Puglia region will list several members of 
traditional parties who decided to run on their own after the 
onslaught of kickbacks scandals: Socialist Costantino Dell'Osso, 
former Christian Democrat Industry Undersecretary Luigi Farace, 
former Social Democratic Defense Undersecretary Antonio Bruno 
and former Christian Democratic MP Giuseppe Caroli. 
  Roman Prince Francesco Sforza Ruspoli is running with a 
party 
called Southern Wind -- Viva Zapata for a post in the Puglia 
regional council. 
  Venice will have Christian Democrat Rosy Bindi, Left 
Democrat 
Walter Veltroni (chief editor of the daily L'UNITA'), Elisabetta 
Gardini, former Republican minister Bruno Visentini all facing 
off under the majority system, along with journalist Lucio 
Manisco (Communist Refoundation). 
  The president of the Northern League, Franco Rocchetta, is 
running under a ticket called Pact for Freedom, created by the 
League, Forza Italia and the conservative Christian Democratic 
Center. 
  In Catanzaro, Calabria, art critic Sgarbi and former 
Communist Tiziana Maiolo are both running with Forza Italia, 
which is also supporting Gerardo Sacco, nicknamed "the goldsmith 
of the divas," in Crotone. The Pact for Italy and the People's 
Party together are backing the candidature of Arturo De Felice, 
head of the Calabria Criminapol, in Lamezia Terme, while the 
Progressives are supporting Simona Dalla Chiesa, daughter of 
Nando Dalla Chiesa.

<F P=106> ["cs." report: "What is the Transit Agreement Worth?"] </F>
  [Text] Abel Matutes, European Union (EU) commissioner 
responsible for traffic questions, regards the positive 
referendum on the Alpine initiative as a violation of the spirit 
of the transit agreement. Matutes commented on the result of 
the referendum at a news conference on pan-European traffic 
conference in Crete in mid-March. The traffic commissioner 
admitted that Switzerland's decision of Sunday [20 February] was 
made in conjunction with EU traffic principles as laid down in 
the green book. However, it is incompatible with the transit 
agreement concluded between the EU and Switzerland. From his 
point of view, this will not change if Switzerland affirms that 
it desires to keep its international commitments. Matutes 
commented on the result of the referendum at a news conference 
on theserious circumstance which turns out to be even more 
serious when analyzed on a long-term basis. What is an 
agreement worth if a referendum can be held and it can be 
overruled anytime, Matutes asked. 
  For the Spaniard Matutes, the referendum is casting a shadow 
on future EU negotiations with Switzerland. The commission was 
instructed to check the consequences of the referendum in detail 
-- particularly with a view to bilateral traffic negotiations. 
According to Matutes they might now be jeopardized. The 
transportation commissioner similarly assesses the aviation 
agreement situation. According to Matutes, the substance of the 
mandate for traffic negotiations that the transportation 
ministers originally wanted to adopt in mid-April must be 
revised. The referendum will also affect air traffic 
negotiations, he said. However, nothing is currently impossible, 
everything must be thoroughly considered now. 
  Matutes is worried most about discrimination on the part of 
EU transporters. Discrimination is not acceptable, he said. He 
also insisted on freedom of movement for goods and persons. 
Matutes recalled that in the negotiations with Switzerland a 
global balance is sought and one does not want to confine 
oneself to one point. However, the result of the referendum has 
changed the possibilities, he said. The transportation 
commissioner hopes that he will be able to discuss alternatives 
with Federal Councilor Ogi at the conference in Crete, in order 
to find a way out of the dead end. He is banking, among other 
things, on the political abilities of the Swiss transportation 
minister, he said.

<F P=106> [Article signed NI: "Visit to Bern by Czech Foreign </F>
Minister: `We Want To Invest in Your Country Too'"; as released 
by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 24 Feb (ATS) -- Josef Zieleniec, Czech 
minister of foreign affairs, made an official working visit to 
Bern on Thursday [24 February]. "We want to invest in 
Switzerland too," Mr. Zieleniec told the press after talks with 
Federal Council Member Flavio Cotti. The two ministers signed 
an agreement renewing all the treaties concluded with the former 
Czechoslovakia. A convention on dual taxation should "shortly" 
be ready for signing. 
  The Czech minister also paid a courtesy visit in the 
afternoon to Confederation President Otto Stich. According to 
Flavio Cotti, relations between the two countries are 
"untroubled." With regard to Europe's security architecture, 
Mr. Zieleniec reaffirmed his country's desire to join the 
European Union and NATO. A first step will be the signing in 
March of the Partnership for Peace membership documents. 
Switzerland is still examining the question, Flavio Cotti said. 
<H5>  Dual Taxation: Still No Convention </H5>
  With regard to bilateral relations, the Czech minister 
welcomed the involvement of Swiss enterprises which, according 
to him, should be developed further. Switzerland is one of the 
main foreign investors in the Czech Republic. To this day, more 
than 300 joint ventures have been formed between Swiss and 
former Czechoslovakian enterprises which are mainly Czech. 
  "But if we really want to be a capitalist country with a 
market economy, we must invest abroad, and hence in 
Switzerland," Mr. Zieleniec said. According to him, several 
Czech enterprises have already gained a foothold on Swiss soil. 
  The agreement signed in Bern renews the agreements between 
Switzerland and the former Czechoslovakia. Swiss entrepreneurs 
benefit in particular from a bilateral investment protection 
agreement which came into force in 1991. Czech-Swiss trade is 
fundamentally free, aside from the limits placed on the export 
of currency. 
  Another obstacle to bilateral trade is the absence of a 
convention on dual taxation. However, the discussions on this 
subject are almost finished, and it should shortly be possible 
to sign the convention, according to Mr. Zieleniec. Finally, 
the minister reported a plan for a Czech cultural center in 
Bern, and announced that President Vaclav Havel would visit 
Switzerland this year.

<F P=106> [Article signed ZS/GC: "Flavio Cotti: Prospecting of </F>
Chinese Market Must Be Increased"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Text] Zurich, 25 Feb (ATS) -- China will contribute toward 
shaping the future of our world. The Chinese economy may become 
the engine of the world economy in the next century. Flavio 
Cotti does not want to encourage a throng of small and 
medium-sized Swiss businesses to look for salvation in China, 
but Swiss companies should look into the matter. They still 
have time to hop aboard the "Chinese train," even if it has 
already gotten under way. 
  On Friday [25 February], the head of the Federal Department 
of Foreign Affairs (DFAE) addressed members of the Swiss-Chinese 
Economic Chamber who were holding their general meeting in 
Zurich. China is currently one of the three leading economic 
powers in the world. With $195.7 billion in direct foreign 
trade, it became the world's eleventh largest trading country in 
1993. 
  China is regionalizing its economy, the federal councillor 
continued. At the same time, the Chinese economy has become 
internationalized. The government intends to increase direct 
exports to $230 billion in the year 2000 and $700 billion in 
2010. The OECD estimates that by 2030 the country will account 
for some 20 percent of world trade. 
<H5>  Global Concept </H5>
  Bern is currently working on a global concept for its 
relations with China. This will primarily consist of lending 
increased political support to the activities of the private 
economy. Greater account will also have to be taken of the 
phenomenon of regionalization and regular links will have to be 
established with the provincial and local authorities in regions 
experiencing outright growth. 
  Major efforts will have to be undertaken to make the Chinese 
market more accessible to Swiss firms. The information 
regarding this market should be updated, Flavio Cotti stressed. 
The idea of reactivating cooperation between existing bodies -- 
Swiss-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, OSEC [Swiss Office of Trade 
Expansion], etc. -- should also be considered. 
<H5>  Accent on Southern China </H5>
  Swiss representations in China will be able to activate the 
support provided on site. The Hong Kong consulate general will 
be able to play a more active role in prospecting the southern 
market. Sixteen Swiss companies have already been installed in 
Shanghai, not including those in the region which manufacture 
light industrial products for export. The creation of a 
consulate general on site would be justified. 
  Switzerland wants to work on protecting intellectual 
property 
in China, on reducing tariff barriers, and on eliminating 
non-tariff obstacles to trade. It also intends to promote 
China's rapid integration into GATT. It would also be desirable 
"that privileged relations between Swiss and Chinese authorities 
take root and prosper." 
  Politically speaking, Bern wants to have more regular and 
in- 
depth talks with Beijing on "all" major issues of mutual 
interest. The head of the DFAE alluded to human rights, an issue 
which should be discussed in greater depth. 
  Swiss investments made or planned in China total some 1.5 
billion Swiss francs. Some 60 mergers already exist and some 70 
businesses are directly present on the Chinese market.

<F P=106> [Article signed HS/BN: "End of Visit to Poland by Federal </F>
Councillor Flavio Cotti -- Talks Focus on Security and Economic 
Development"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Warsaw, 22 Feb (ATS) -- On Tuesday [22 February], 
Federal Councillor Flavio Cotti concluded his two-day visit to 
Poland, where he had an opportunity to talk with the main actors 
in the Polish political arena: President Lech Walesa, Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak, and his counterpart Andrzej 
Olechowski. Although unanimous in their praise for Swiss aid, 
Mr. Cotti's dialogue partners nevertheless reiterated that only 
investments could ensure the stability of the country. 
  "Poland is a priority recipient of Swiss aid to the East," 
said Flavio Cotti at the end of a courtesy visit paid to 
President Walesa. Mr. Cotti, head of the Swiss Federal 
Department of Foreign Affairs [DFAE] wants Swiss aid to be 
accompanied by private sector investments. 
<H5>  Upcoming State Visit </H5>
  "We are waiting for you, come and do business with us," said 
Lech Walesa, addressing his visitors. Furthermore, Mr. Walesa 
will have an opportunity to establish contacts with the private 
sector during his state visit in May. 
  President Walesa believes that Europe has not yet found a 
solution that could satisfy the countries of the East. "The 
postcommunist states still find themselves in a vacuum," he said 
regretfully, alluding to the lack of a collective security 
system which would include his country. His concern is shared 
by Prime Minister Pawlak. 
  The questions of European security and Polish economic 
development also dominated talks between Ms. Cotti and Mr. 
Olechowski the day before. Both men emphasized the fundamental 
Russian role within the context of a peaceful Europe. "Russian 
participation in international peacekeeping efforts must occur 
under the mandate and the supervision of a collective security 
organization," Mr. Cotti told a Polish daily. 
  On the economic level, the Polish foreign minister also 
launched an appeal to Swiss entrepreneurs to invest more money 
in his country. Furthermore, he hoped Western markets would 
open up more to Polish products. Switzerland ranks eighth among 
principal investors in Poland for 1991-1993, investing 150 
million Swiss francs. 
<H5>  Swiss Aid </H5>
  Poland is one of the main recipients of financial aid 
allocated to the new democracies in the East. Switzerland's 
commitment to Poland is based on two main axes: technological 
cooperation and financial assistance. At the end of 1993, 
Switzerland's total commitment amounted to 310.5 million Swiss 
francs, of which 25.3 million were designated for cooperation, 
and 285.2 million for financial aid. 
  On Tuesday, Mr. Cotti went to Poznan specifically to see for 
himself one of the first projects carried out within the 
framework of technological cooperation: the covered market in 
Poznan. This accomplishment aims to promote an economic model 
for regional supplying. 
<H5>  Warsaw's European Option </H5>
  The European option constitutes the dominant idea in 
Poland's 
foreign policy. Its principal objectives include rapid 
integration into the European Union [EU], and membership of some 
kind of collective defense system. Warsaw has already signed 
the Partnership for Peace agreement with NATO in the hope that 
it will lead to membership of the Atlantic alliance. 
  With this in mind, [Polish] political leaders are extending 
their contacts with their European partners. They want to make 
political, cultural, and economic links durable with a view to 
guaranteeing Poland's place in West Europe. However, for a 
large number of citizens, the division of Europe will endure, 
despite the fall of the Berlin Wall: The old Iron Curtain has 
turned into a frontier of prosperity.

<F P=106> ["U.M."-initialed report: "7.8 Billion in Federal Deficit"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Bern, 23 February -- The Swiss federal budget for 
the year 1993 shows a deficit of 7,818 million Swiss francs: 
while 40.6 billion francs were spent, revenue only amounted to 
32.7 billion francs. The deficit is 5 billion higher than in 
1992 and 4.7 billion higher than expected. 
  What was already understood when the 1994 draft budget was 
presented was confirmed by the 1993 calculations, which were 
approved by the Federal Council on Wednesday [23 February]; the 
federal financial situation has dramatically deteriorated within 
a year. The bad economic situation affected both the revenue 
and expenditure side; moreover, the excessive structural burden 
on the budget has also been clearly demonstrated. The 1993 
draft budget still had a deficit of 3,086 million. Meanwhile, 
Parliament approved 2.9 billion francs in supplementary credits. 
Actual additional expenditure only amounted to 862 million 
francs. Moreover, there are credits of 2 billion francs 
remaining. Thus, these are twice as high as in 1992. On the 
revenue side, 3.9 billion francs less was earned than expected 
in the budget. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Michael Binyon report: "Athens Admits `Shock Tactics'"] </F>
  [Text] The Greek Foreign Minister admitted at the weekend 
that Athens had closed the port of Salonika to all Macedonian 
goods as a "shock tactic" to force a resolution to its 
long-running dispute with Skopje over The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia's name, flag and constitution. 
  Karolos Papoulias said he did not want a confrontation, but 
this was the only way to let Skopje and the world know how 
strongly Greece felt about the matter. Athens would lift the 
embargo, imposed this month, only if the Skopje government 
changed its flag and dropped articles in its constitution that 
implied territorial claims on Greece. 
  Speaking on the eve of talks here with Douglas Hurd, the 
Foreign Secretary, who will warn the Greek government today that 
its European Union partners condemn the closure of Salonika, Mr. 
Papoulias also called for a new pan-Balkan conference after a 
cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina to resolve lingering tensions 
in the region. 
  Mr. Papoulias said there had been an explosion of popular 
anger in Greece over the former Yugoslav republic's "insult." 
The government had to do something to force a confrontation as 
one by one other countries were establishing diplomatic 
relations with Skopje. The Salonika decision had been hastened 
by the recent American decision to establish relations. 
  Asked whether the move was illegal under European Union law, 
Mr Papoulias said there was a long history of illegal moves in 
the EU, citing the actions of fishermen and farmers who had 
forced a change of policy. Greece had given its legal 
justification to Brussels, but the move was essentially 
political. "The government was forced to act by the threats in 
the constitution of that state. Greeks feel threatened by the 
propaganda from Skopje," he said. 
  Hans van den Broek, the EU External Affairs Commissioner, 
spent two days last week in fruitless shuttles between Athens 
and Skopje to mediate. The Commission is threatening to take 
the Greek government to the European Court of Justice, a move 
officials here acknowledge is now likely.

<F P=106> [Erich Hoorn report: "Boom of Exports to Kazakhstan"] </F>
  [Text] Almaty -- The intensive work of Austrian firms in 
the Kazakh market has led to positive results in the hotly 
contested market: In 1993 Austria's exports increased by 931.9 
percent to 320.9 million schillings; 1 billion schillings will 
probably be achieved this year, Guenther Richter, Austrian trade 
delegate to Moscow, told DIE PRESSE. 
  In connection with the implementation of construction 
projects -- the construction of a hotel in Almaty by the ABV -- 
machines and structural steel have so far been exported. 
Moreover, telephone systems, television and radio sets, 
medicine, medical-technical equipment, and drugs are supplied. 
Altogether two dozen Austrian companies already are active in 
Kazakhstan, eight have their own representations. Many 
enterprises handle the market via Moscow. The 40 participants 
in the fourth Austrian economic mission in Kazakhstan were very 
satisfied with the talks. 
  The export business is facilitated by a credit line 
established by the Control Bank. However, importance is 
attached to a high Austrian net output (70 percent), Richter 
stressed. The Kazakh Alem Bank is responsible for inclusion in 
the guarantee line. 
  The Kazakh Government has worked out a list of priorities, 
which encompasses 34 projects that can be included in the 
guarantee line of the Control Bank. Documentation on 15 
projects with a volume of $350 million (about 4.2 billion 
schillings), on which an expert report already exists, have been 
passed on to the Alem Bank. 
  B.V. Utemuratov, deputy minister for foreign trade, stressed 
that there are already 21 joint ventures with Austria. Among 
the projects already in progress are the delivery of machines 
for the production of enamel varnish wires, the establishment of 
a plant for plastic doors and windows, a spirits factory, the 
delivery of electronic television and radio facilities, and of 
medical equipment. 
  The Voest-Industrieanlagenbau Company wants to modernize a 
metallurgical combine in Karaganda and build two continuous 
casting plants. The project will probably cost 4 billion 
schillings (Austrian share). The project is to be implemented 
in a consortium with Turkish and Japanese partners. One is also 
negotiating on the establishment of joint ventures within the 
framework of the agreement on railroad cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article signed KvdB/GSC: "Hebron Killings Leading To </F>
Disorders in Brussels"] 
  [Excerpt] The bloody killing of Palestinian Muslims by a 
Jewish settler in Hebron, has repercussions in our own country. 
Yesterday night, rather unexpected riots broke out in Brussels. 
  They were caused by two events occurring close to each 
other. 
On the one hand, there was a lecture (with a movie performance 
of Schindler's List) by Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal in 
Hotel Metropole at the Place De Brouckere, and on the other hand 
a demonstration of the Anti-Imperialistic Union, associated with 
the PvdA [Belgian Party of Labor], and of Youngsters for 
Palestine at the Place de la Monnaie. The latter learned about 
Wiesenthal's lecture, and headed for the Place De Brouckere.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Shawqi Armali, PLO representative to </F>
Belgium, by anchorman Xavier Lambrechts -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Lambrechts] Mr. Armali, do you think that the 
Hebron massacre marks the end of the peace process? 
  [Armali] Well, I hope things will not reach that extreme, 
but 
we are very likely to reach it if the current situation 
continues. It must be stressed that the Israeli Government has 
a particular responsibility for today's events -- this Hebron 
butchery. First, it is the Israeli Government that settled the 
colonies everywhere in the occupied territories after 1967 in 
violation of all international conventions and rights. Second, 
the Qiryat Arba' colony where the most fanatic settlers live was 
supported and established by the Israeli Government of that 
time, i.e., 15 years ago. But the worst is that the same 
government tolerated the creation of militias among the settlers 
and the arming of the settlers. We have seen just how some 
people can stroll with impunity among the civilian population 
with their weapons. Those conditions made it possible for the 
perpetrator of the Hebron slaughter to do what he did with the 
unquestioned complicity of several other people. Because this 
is absolutely.... 
  [Lambrechts, interrupting] Mr. Armali, I was just about to 
ask you this question: Do you think this massacre was 
perpetrated by one man only? 
  [Armali] Absolutely not. When you look at the number of the 
victims and the injured -- which might exceed 130 people -- it 
is absolutely certain that only one perpetrator was involved. 
  [Lambrechts] Do you think the Israeli Armed Forces or 
Government should have disarmed the Israeli militias and 
settlers? 
  [Armali] Definitely. The Israeli Government must see to it 
that security is enforced in the occupied territories through 
its security forces and it should not encourage the creation of 
militias and armed groups, the result of which can be seen 
today. On the other hand, the Israeli Government has shown just 
that it is unable to ensure security in the area of the holy 
places, be they Christian or Muslim, not only in Hebron but also 
in Jerusalem. The Hebron mosque, for example, was the 
responsibility of the Israeli soldiers. 
  [Lambrechts] Yes, one will remember that the Hebron mosque 
is 
also an Israeli and Christian religious place. 
  [Armali] You are right. After today's sad events, the whole 
international community must be concerned about the [security 
of] other holy places in the Palestine. 
  [Lambrechts] Mr. Armali, do you -- as PLO representative to 
Belgium -- think the peace negotiations with Israel are in 
jeopardy. Are you ready to sit down at the same table as Mr. 
Rabin? 
  [Armali] This is one of the most serious threats since the 
signing of the 13 December peace accord and the hopes for peace 
that it brought to both populations -- Palestinians and Jews. 
Unfortunately, since that historic date, all the deadlines set 
in the Oslo agreements have not been met. Furthermore, the 
Israeli prime minister repeated over and over again that there 
is no sacred date. This has increased the frustration among the 
Palestinian public. And today 25 February, the Palestinians are 
being repressed still by the Israeli Armed Forces. Over 11,000 
Palestinians are detained still in Israeli prisons and the date 
for the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho is still not 
known. Things must move along quickly. I must stress this is 
the last chance for the peace process to continue. As we know, 
the U.S. Administration has decided -- with the approval of Mr. 
'Arafat and Mr. Rabin -- to convene.... 
  [Lambrechst, interrupting] We will raise this issue in a few 
seconds. But the PLO demands -- and this is important to 
mention -- international protection in the occupied territories. 
The possible presence of UN troops or U.S. or British soldiers 
has even been envisaged. Does it sound realistic to you? 
  [Armali] Yes, of course. Because these territories are 
occupied, the UN Security Council, which is expected to meet at 
any time now, will have to examine the issue and decide to send 
U.S., European, or other international troops to protect the 
Palestinian population because it is not clear whether the 
Israeli Government really wants to make decisions to disarm the 
settlers. We have no other option left. As long as the 
settlers are armed, today's tragic events can happen again. And 
it could give a fatal blow to any hope for peace. In order to 
secure this peace process that was initiated with so much 
difficulty, a decision must be made as quickly as possible to 
ensure the protection of the Palestinian civilian population 
which is still under occupation. [passage omitted] 
  [Lambrechts] Mr. Armali, what do you specifically expect 
from 
the U.S. side? 
  [Armali] What we always have requested from Washington: A 
greater presence and a more active role in the ongoing 
negotiations. 
  [Lambrechts] Does President Clinton's proposal go in the 
right direction? 
  [Armali] It was accepted by the PLO and I hope that today's 
tragedy will convince many people -- mainly on the Israeli side 
-- that the deadlines set [in the peace negotiation process] 
must be pushed forward and that the withdrawal from the occupied 
territories is necessary. This is a unanimous request from the 
international community, so that the Palestinians can take their 
destiny in hand and continue to serenely negotiate this final 
and long-lasting peace for which we all long. 
  [Lambrechst] Thank you for being our guest tonight Mr. 
Armali.

<F P=106> [Jerry van Waterschoot commentary: "Fasten Your Seat Belts"] </F>
  [Text] Will the political world in general, and the 
Socialist Party (SP) in particular, have to go through yet 
another wave of scandal, so soon after the Agusta case with the 
reemergence of the Uniop case? The ball certainly is rolling 
again. If it actually is established that fake studies were 
ordered in order to illicitly channel public funds to political 
parties, the political world is heading for a "fasten your seat 
belt" operation. 
  The Agusta case led to the resignation of three ministers, 
but that is not the end of the story. Not only is the 
investigation still going on, the reputation of the political 
establishment was also badly damaged. More than ever before, 
transparency is needed in the financing of political parties and 
in the unsavory affairs which keep cropping up. After the 
Agusta case, in which the relevant ministers created the 
impression they would rather cling to power than aim at full 
openness, politicians can certainly no longer afford to cover up 
their suspicious affairs. 
  An agitated SP Chairman Busquin denied all guilt yesterday, 
and suggested that the time now has come to pry into other 
parties' business. Busquin obviously is offended because, of 
all parties, it was the SP which was attacked twice in a row. 
  Is it a coincidence or a maneuver by party-political 
opponents? Other parties are not likely to be any more innocent 
than the SP. There is certainly a good chance that other affairs 
will crop up in other parties, or that slandering campaigns will 
be fought. 
  Anyway, this is no reason not to unravel the Uniop case to 
the bone, not even if consequences can be far-reaching. In the 
case, the names of the few remaining SP leaders are mentioned: 
Busquin himself, the man who kept the party in shaky balance 
when the three Guys disappeared, and Moureaux, who stood up as 
the party's moral conscience in the Agusta case. 
  If these two politicians also are discredited seriously, or 
if the parties start to unveil each other's unsavory affairs, 
things will be out of control. The politicians' credibility 
already has reached an all-time low, and the citizen is not 
eager to witness yet another wave of scandals. If governments 
were to fall or if elections were fought over the issue, with 
all resulting protest votes or political instability, chaos 
would be complete. 
  However, if this is the inevitable consequence of the 
uncovering of illicit practices, then so be it. If the search 
for honest political ethics means, that the political 
establishment must first be cleansed, then it must be done. The 
politicians, the people's representatives, owe it to themselves. 
  Certainly now that, as a result of the previous affair, 
there 
is a growing awareness that something must change, as shown by 
the new mentality with regard to the regulations on party 
financing. In Italy, things also had to go very badly for the 
political establishment, before the situation cleared up.

  [Excerpts] Brussels -- Luis Moreno and Raquel Garcia, the 
two ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] suspects who applied for 
political asylum in Belgium to no avail, heard the news of the 
bomb threat via Spanish television in their flat in Brussels. 
Moreno and Garcia are certain the threats are the work of 
infiltrators from the Spanish secret service. Earlier this 
month the couple appealed against the Belgian decision to not 
recognize them as political refugees. [passage omitted] 
  "They [the Spanish secret service] want to make the life of 
the Belgian Government so difficult it has to deport us from the 
country," they said. "But we know better. If the ETA is 
planning an attack, then it does so through its own channels. 
At the bottom of the threatening letter they always put the 
standard round stamp with the logo of the independence movement. 
Not some Arab signature or other." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Jos Klaassen: "`Jerusalem Is Sabotaging </F>
Palestinian Trade With European Union'"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The European Union [EU] must set strict 
conditions when it renews its association agreement with Israel, 
so that the Israelis implement the peace agreement with the PLO 
fairly, according to Socialist MEP [member of the European 
Parliament] Eisso Woltjer. Woltjer returned from Israel on 
Thursday [24 February] and is the draftsman of the European 
Parliament's (EP) opinion on the peace talks. 
  After his three-day visit to the Occupied Territories and 
Jerusalem, Woltjer came to the conclusion that the EU should put 
more pressure on Israel. He proposed that the EU should use 
both the association agreement and its financial protocols with 
Israel -- involving millions of guilders in loans -- to 
influence the peace process. 
  "Everything must be done to improve the appalling living 
conditions of the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories, 
otherwise the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement is doomed to 
failure," Woltjer said. In April the EP will debate the current 
state of the peace agreement. 
  "The European Commission then will be asked to increase the 
pressure on Israel," the Netherlands MEP announced. He spoke of 
"positive-critical" pressure on Israel, because in his opinion 
the rapprochement policies of the Rabin government were the only 
correct ones. "Rabin must be helped against the pressure of the 
army and the opposition," he said. 
  In the meantime the EP has formed an ad hoc delegation for 
Palestine including all the European parties. This delegation, 
led by Claude Cheysson and Woltjer, wants to monitor how the 
Commission is fulfilling the promises made to the Palestinians 
since the peace agreement between Israel and the PLO. 
  Woltjer returned from his mission to the territories 
occupied 
by Israel "with little euphoria." He blamed the Israeli 
Government for the bloodbath in Hebron. "They are responsible 
in the Occupied Territories," Woltjer said. "With my own eyes I 
have seen how Jewish colonists walk round everywhere armed. The 
government allows that and therefore, as the ruler in the area, 
it is also guilty." 
  According to what he saw, the Palestinian population as yet 
has seen nothing positive from the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
agreement. The perspectives for an Israeli-Palestinian detente 
were very poor, he said. The Palestinians in the Occupied 
Territories indeed will gain more say over tourism, health care, 
and education. "But if they want to build just one hospital 
they have to ask the army for permission, because 60 percent of 
the land has been nationalized by Israel," Woltjer said. 
  He questioned the viability of Gaza, where Israel is 
demanding a safety zone which includes approximately half the 
Gaza Strip and also "accounts for the most usable land." 
Woltjer accused Israel of sabotaging the export of Palestinian 
agricultural and market gardening products. 
  The EP has demanded that the possibilty exist for these 
products to be exported directly to Europe. "But in practice," 
Woltjer said," the Israelis carry out detailed security checks, 
the costs of which are then passed on to exporters. This makes 
the earnings of the exporters very small." Therefore the 
building of a harbor in an autonomous Gaza is an "absolute 
necessity." 
  The EU has made approximately one billion guilders available 
for the Palestinian refugee camps and, among other thins, it 
finances education centers. But Israel is blocking the import 
of materials, because Jerusalem wants the Palestinians to pay 
sales tax on deliveries. "Europe and Israel are arguing about 
the issue," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Suzanne Breen: "Ball Back in British Court, SF </F>
Believes"] 
  [Text] On the eve of Sinn Fein's [SF] ard-fheis [annual 
conference], republican activists in Belfast believe their party 
has played its cards skillfully since the signing of the Downing 
Street Declaration. "There was immense pressure on Sinn Fein 
and the IRA for an immediate response to the document last 
December," said one senior activist from Andersonstown, "and yet 
we have managed to turn the tables, to throw the ball back to 
the British. 
  "The key to it all has been calling for clarification. When 
we call for clarification, we are effectively calling for 
negotiation. We are asking the British to give us what we want, 
what they know it will take to end the war -- that is a 
withdrawal. 
  "Yet the very complexities ambiguities of the declaration 
mean that our appeal for clarification can't be totally 
dismissed. It appears to be reasonable; it has been supported 
by Albert Reynolds and John Hume. That will make it very hard 
for the Brits to introduce a tough security package." 
  Although he recognised that Sinn Fein was unlikely to make 
substantial electoral gains in the Republic, the speaker said 
that the lifting of Section 31 had helped "humanise" republicans 
for southern audiences and was important in terms of the 
propaganda war. 
  By "spinning things out," republicans had reduced the 
dramatic impact of the Major-Reynolds initiative, he argued. 
The declaration wasn't "worth the paper it was written on," and 
there were no plans to hold an IRA convention to vote on the 
document -- "it's just a non-starter." But any private signals 
from the British that they were seriously considering a 
withdrawal could "move the situation on rapidly." According to 
another activist in west Belfast, the short-term aim of the 
republican movement is for the secret channels of communication 
with the British government to be reopened. Like the first 
quoted republican, this man is also a veteran Sinn Fein activist 
who has spent time in jail. He insisted that the continuation 
of the IRA campaign would eventually reap political rewards for 
Sinn Fein. 
  IRA operations had been refined over recent months, with a 
greater concentration on attacks against the security forces and 
none, for example, on softer targets such as contractors working 
for the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary]. The Provisionals were 
opting for "low-key operations" -- planting incendiaries in 
stores and business premises rather than bombing Protestant 
towns. 
  The republican activist accused the SDLP [Social Democratic 
and Labor Party] deputy Ieader, Mr Seamus Mallon (who has 
continuously stressed the similarities between Hume-Adams and 
Major-Reynolds on self-determination) of "hampering the peace 
process" and deeply embarrassing his party Ieader, Mr John Hume. 
  The Hume-Adams agreement was between "Sinn Fein and John 
Hume, not Sinn Fein and the SDLP," he said, indicating that not 
everyone in the SDLP was committed to the agreement between the 
two nationalist leaders. However, the source believed that Mr 
Hume's high standing in the SDLP would ensure that he carried 
the rest of the party with him. 
  The Sinn Fein activist asserted that the British government 
would eventually offer republicans further concessions, but that 
its reliance on unionist votes at Westminster made this unlikely 
in the short term. 
  Sinn Fein would prefer a strong Conservative government 
which 
could "deliver on Ireland" to a Labour administration, despite 
Labour's more sympathetic policies towards Irish unity, he said. 
However, republicans are planning to target Labour MPs for 
intensive lobbying on the peace process over the coming months.

<F P=106> [Report by Joe Carroll: "Taoiseach Urges SF To Endorse </F>
Non-Coercion Policy on Unionists"] 
  [Text] The Taoiseach, [prime minister], Mr Reynolds, has 
appealed to Sinn Fein on the eve of its ard-fheis [annual 
conference] to "make an immense step forward" and clearly 
endorse a policy of non-coercion towards the unionist majority 
in Northern Ireland. 
  He reminded Sinn Fein that a future British Government 
"would 
be quite free to adopt a united Ireland" as its long-term policy 
under the Downing Street Declaration and the Anglo-Irish 
Agreement, provided it adhered to the requirement of majority 
consent. 
  While welcoming this week's speech by the Northern 
Secretary, 
Sir Patrick Mayhew, favouring a role for new North-South 
institutions, the Taoiseach insisted that now was the time when 
"the republican movement needs to clarify more fully its own 
attitudes to Northern Protestants and unionists." 
  He said he did not expect Sinn Fein to renounce violence and 
make a definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration at 
the ard-fheis but "it would be very welcome if they do." If 
Sinn Fein could "clear up" where it stood on the right of the 
protestant population in Northern Ireland not to have to accept 
Irish unity, then "this would be a vital step...to trying to get 
everybody into the political process...." 
  In a speech to the Association of European Journalists in 
Dublin, the Taoiseach quoted from an article in the Republican 
magazine, the Starry Plough, in January 1992, by Mr Mitchel 
Mclaughlin of Sinn Fein where he stated: "The truth is that we 
cannot and should not ever try to coerce the Protestant people 
into a united Ireland." 
  But Mr McLaughlin had also acknowledged "an element among 
republicans and others who secretly believed the Protestant 
population could be coerced into accepting Irish unity and 
independence." Mr McLaughlin had said that was "not acceptable, 
and it was not possible, as Republicans should know better than 
anyone...." 
  The Taoiseach said: "If that is Sinn Fein's policy, and I 
believe it is, the implications of it need to be thought through 
and debated.... A clear endorsement of a policy of non-coercion 
vis-a-vis those they regard as a national minority at the 
ard-fheis would represent an immense step forward." 
  In an attempt to rebut republican critics of the 
declaration, 
the Taoiseach said there were still misunderstandings that 
needed to be cleared up. "It is wrongly claimed that the 
unionists have been given a veto on British Government policy in 
the Joint Declaration. A future British Government would be 
quite free to adopt a united Ireland as its long-term policy 
aim, provided they adhered to the requirement of consent," which 
was an obligation under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. 
  In answer to questions, the Taoiseach pointed out that the 
one-time unionist veto on British policy had been "diluted along 
the way. That kind of veto does not exist any more." 
  Mr Reynolds said it was "nonsense to suggest that in 
embracing the peace process only republicans are being asked to 
make sacrifices for peace. Unionists have to accept that the 
constitutional future of Northern Ireland remains open and that 
if there is to be real peace there has to be an agreement 
between the people of Ireland, North and South, on one shared 
future on this island."

violated the no-fly zone imposed on the country. The four 
planes had been shot at only after two warnings had been given, 
Vogel told journalists in Bonn today. NATO had adhered strictly 
to the UN resolution on the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The shooting down was the "bitter, but necessary" consequence 
of the conduct of the downed pilots and their commanders. The 
federal government was confident that the peace process in the 
former Yugoslavia would not be held up by the incident. 
  A spokesman of the Federal Defense Ministry confirmed that 
German servicemen were also aboard the AWACS reconnaissance 
aircraft that coordinated the NATO operation. At the same time, 
he stated that the deployment of German servicemen on AWACS 
aircraft had been declared constitutional by the Federal 
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F>
correspondent Udo van Kampen in Brussels on 28 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Van Kampen] A few moments ago I had a chance to get 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's first reaction to this first 
NATO military strike. 
  [Kinkel] This is indeed the first NATO strike of this kind, 
which shows that if peaceful political solutions are not brought 
about then we will get serious with what we have decided upon. 
  [Van Kampen] Isn't there now the threat that the conflict 
will escalate? 
  [Kinkel] No, I don't think so. Rather, I think that if it 
was the Serb side, it will now be clear to those involved that 
it is a serious matter when the security measures set by the 
Security Council -- in this case the no-fly zone -- are violated. 
  [Van Kampen] If the Serbs retaliate, will NATO continue to 
act consistently? 
  [Kinkel] I am not responsible for NATO decisions, but I 
cannot imagine that the Serbs will retaliate. First we have to 
look at what took place and I assume that all the details will 
come to light soon. 
  [Van Kampen] Were German crews involved in the so-called 
AWACS flights, the reconnaissance flights? 
  [Kinkel] That is still being looked into at the moment. I 
can't tell you that for definite yet. If they were involved, it 
will have been within the framework of their mission which was 
approved by the Federal Constitutional Court. 
  [Van Kampen] Do you assume, or have you already been in 
touch 
and know that the Russians approve of this mission? 
  [Kinkel] No. I haven't had sufficient time to do that yet 
but I've instructed the office in Bonn to make all sorts of 
inquiries and as soon as I have more news I will be happy to 
tell you. 
  [Van Kampen] The Russians did support Security Council 
Resolution 816 when it was made. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, of course. They knew that things could get 
serious in a case such as this if an unpermitted violation of 
the no-fly zone took place and this is evidently what happened 
here. It has been said -- and I am not in a position to confirm 
this either because I don't know -- that the planes either 
attacked a munition factory beforehand or intended to attack it.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Karl Lamers, foreign policy </F>
spokesman for the CDU/CSU Bundestag group, by Friedbert Meurer; 
Meurer is in the studio in Cologne, place of Lamers not given -- 
live] 
  [Text] [Meurer] What do you think of the fact that NATO 
shot down four Serbian aircraft over Bosnia? 
  [Lamers] It was a necessary and consistent step. Although 
Mr. Kinkel is, of course, right when he says that this was an 
isolated operation, I would like to point out that the measure 
is part of the policy NATO has pursued with its ultimatum in 
accordance with the United Nations, and, for example, also in 
accordance with the opening of the bridge in Sarajevo. 
  [Meurer] Mr. Lamers, does this mean that by shooting down 
those aircraft this morning, NATO wanted to show that it was 
taking the ultimatum of last Monday [21 February] seriously? 
  [Lamers] Yes, and NATO, first of all, wanted to demonstrate 
that the Serbs were wrong in thinking that they could make 
partial and regionally limited concessions -- limited to 
Sarajevo -- while continuing their activities and attacks 
elsewhere to create facts. I think that this is a most decisive 
point. Now it will depend on their reaction -- the reaction of 
the Serbs, which, incidentally, will essentially depend on the 
reaction of the Russians. The choice is one between cease-fire 
and really serious efforts for peace and escalation. 
  [Meurer] What is the importance of the military flights, the 
flights by the Serbian Air Force, for the war in Bosnia? 
  [Lamers] This question is difficult to answer. There have 
been innumerous violations of the no-fly decision. Still, if I 
see and interpret things correctly then the attack against the 
ammunition factory was a very serious escalation by the Serbian 
side, which is, of course, of significant importance, because 
the Muslims and the Croats do not have such heavy weapons, and, 
in particular, no aircraft. 
  [Meurer] In connection with the NATO ultimatum, which called 
for withdrawing all heavy arms from around Sarajevo, there has 
been some controversy with Moscow, which did not really approve 
of NATO's policy. What reactions do you now expect from Moscow? 
  [Lamers] The first reaction of which I have heard is 
moderate, and absolutely all right. The Russian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said that if things really happened that way, 
if there really was a Serbian attack against the ammunition 
factory, then it was a violation of the UN resolution, and then 
NATO's reaction was O.K. I hope that this position will not 
change. There can be no doubt that this is also a test of the 
constructive nature of Russia's role in Sarajevo. That there 
are some question marks in this connection is obvious; I also 
have some doubts. I do, however, hope that the Russians will 
continue to react in the way that is now beginning to show -- I 
have to put that very cautiously -- otherwise it would be 
problematic -- beyond Bosnia -- for relations between Russia and 
the West.

<F P=106> [Herbert Kremp editorial: "Minor Power"] </F>
  [Text] The following was more obvious in the Anglo-Saxon 
and the French world than in the German one, which is quite 
naive regarding power-political considerations: As a result of 
the Balkans conflict, not only Russia but the old policy of 
balance has returned to world diplomacy. 
  The United States, Russia, and France are drafting the big 
moves of conflict settlement without Germany, and they are 
gaining influence and securing their positions for the future. 
The election campaign in Germany and its uncertain outcome 
contribute to that. If a changeover of power should take place 
in October, two possible developments are likely: A growing 
unworldly introversion of German policies and a strong French 
leadership in the mediating diplomacy between the European Union 
and the Atlantic Alliance. 
  In the runup to the NATO ultimatum, a remarkable 
rapprochement between the United States and France took place. 
Relations between the two countries seemed to have reached a 
critical stage weeks ago that lasted until after the NATO summit 
in January. When the ultimatum expired, Russian diplomacy 
succeeded in claiming the change in Sarajevo as its achievement. 
It was possible for the withdrawing Serbs to pretend that they 
were following Moscow's advice and not giving in to NATO 
pressure. Politically, the situation of the Serbs has improved 
at the expense of the Bosnians and the Croats. Nobody will 
question their territorial conquests. Paris, London, Moscow, and 
finally also Washington are seeking a solution on the basis of 
the current military status. 
  In fact, it will take a great deal of time to achieve that 
but the Slovenes and the Croatians already know at this point 
that their hopes for further support from Germany -- beyond 
efforts to ensure their recognition -- will not be fulfilled. 
The truth is that the power at the center has been pushed to 
the margin.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe commentary: "An Ultimatum Does Not Yet Make </F>
Peace"] 
  [Text] Almost every day a new play is staged on the 
Bosnian stage, and whether all these plays will promote peace is 
the prize question of 1994. The latest surprise move once again 
comes from Moscow: On Wednesday [24 February] Boris Yeltsin 
proposed a summit on the former Yugoslavia at short notice -- 
and he did not do so via the usual, relatively discreet 
diplomatic channels but in front of gathered journalists. 
  An "interesting idea," London commented succinctly, but one 
has not yet received a "formal invitation." What are the United 
States, Russia, Britain, France, and Germany supposed to decide 
at this one-day summit? This is not known, but even today one 
can assume that Yeltsin is not so much interested in peace as in 
Moscow's advantage as the one taking the initiative, because in 
the same breath Yeltsin complained about the "attempts by some 
Western leaders" to "discriminate against Russia." Whoever they 
might be -- they will certainly not be happy about the fact that 
Chancellor Kohl (as the Bonn Foreign Ministry has let it be 
known) has already given his blessing to the Russian summit 
project. A common Balkan policy along the Bonn-Moscow "axis" -- 
this gives rise to unpleasant memories among certain "Western 
leaders." 
  In addition, another problem is putting a strain on Bonn's 
Bosnian policy. Since relative calm is now reigning in 
Sarajevo, people are turning to look toward Mostar, where it is 
not the Serbs but the Croats who are besieging the Muslims. 
Therefore, the international community would also have to act 
energetically against the Croatian troops in Herzegovina. 
However, as a Western diplomat, who wants to remain anonymous, 
complains: "We have not exerted any real pressure on the 
Croats. We cannot even threaten them with sanctions, because 
Germany would prevent them." If this is not only a private 
opinion, Klaus Kinkel will have problems with offering his "good 
services" in Bosnian diplomacy. Anyone who is identified with 
one side in the conflict cannot really play -- as Bismarck in 
the past -- the "honest broker." 
  And what about the Americans? They seem to have lost their 
courage again. Could one not extend the policy of threat in 
Sarajevo to the other parts of the country, where there are 
sieges and attacks? The State Department spokesman waves that 
aside: "Sarajevo was a very special case; we do not want to 
exaggerate." As regards the other case, NATO must hold 
discussions again. 
  NATO is hanging on the United Nations, and the hinges are 
already creaking a lot. When on Tuesday five blue helmet 
soldiers were attacked by mortar fire in Tuzla, Sir Michael 
Rose, the UN commander for Bosnia, wanted to call in NATO 
planes. However, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Commander in 
Chief Jean Cot rejected the wish -- possibly in consideration 
for the UN Security Council in New York, where the Russians are 
stubbornly trying to prevent any NATO operations. 
  Summary: The ultimatum of Sarajevo might indeed remain a 
special case. And the war will continue, while the large and 
medium-sized powers are struggling for prestige and position.

  [Text] Speaking after meeting Cypriot Foreign Minister 
Alekos Mikhailidhis in Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel said he cannot make promises on a solution to the Cyprus 
problem because they would be empty. He said that as the German 
foreign minister, he cannot resolve the problem alone. The only 
thing he can do, he said, is support Cyprus in every way and try 
to help. 
  The German foreign minister said that in every talk he has 
with the Turkish friends, as he referred to them, he raises the 
Cyprus issue. He added, however, that he is in no position to 
dictate a solution to the Turkish side. 
  Referring to the effect that the promotion of Cyprus' 
European Union membership application will have on a solution, 
Kinkel said he understands the Cypriot position but said he is 
reserved and careful. He added that he will raise the issue in 
Brussels. 
  Mikhailidhis said he was satisfied with his meeting with 
Kinkel, although no definite answers were given. Mikhailidhis 
will meet former German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher 
today.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Four Million for Russia's </F>
Right-Winger"] 
  [Text] The suspicion that Werner Girke, the former 
administrator of the foreign assets of the Socialist Unity Party 
of Germany [SED], illegally transferred party funds to Russian 
nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is hardening. Girke, 
who is now employed by the Trust Agency, worked as trustee for 
the SED holding company Orvag since 1991. He is the owner of 
the Orvag subsidiary TVO (Trustee, Administration, and 
Organization company). Meanwhile one knows for sure that a 
financial adviser to the leader of the Russian nationalists 
stayed at TVO for many weeks in the fall of 1993. Another piece 
of evidence is that, after they had met in Austria, a second 
meeting between Girke and Zhirinovskiy took place in Slovenia in 
mid-January. 
  When the premises of Girke's company were searched in early 
January documents were seized that prove that he embezzled 4 
million German marks [DM] from SED foreign assets. Meanwhile, 
the Trust Agency has found out that Girke invested the money in 
companies in Moscow. To what extent the enterprises are 
connected with Zhirinovskiy is currently the subject of 
investigations by the Central Investigations Office for 
Government- and Unification-Related Crime (ZERV).

<F P=106> [Dr. Gerhard Frey article: "Zhirinovskiy's Germany Plan"] </F>
  [Text] "How history sees him is changing with the 
confusion caused by the benevolence and animosity of parties." 
That classical statement also applies to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
even before he has reached the zenith of his political career. 
Why has he, more than any other politician in the second half 
of the 20th century, come under such heavy fire from the 
international media? 
  De Gaulle was right: "The Germans are poor bastards. Their 
backbone has been broken." A great part of our population has 
lost the ability to recognize German interests as a result of 
systematic indoctrination. The reeducation conducted by the 
victors of World War II and their helpers has wiped out the 
capacity for logical political thought in many Germans. Of 
course, it has always been a peculiar trait of the German mind 
to show exceptional understanding for the interests of others 
while disregarding one's own. That any other nation should 
display similar inclinations is scarcely conceivable. 
<H5>  The Role of the West </H5>
  At the end of World War II, the Western powers believed that 
"the German question" had been solved. Churchill's ideas about 
the establishment of a northern German state and a southern 
German state including Bavaria and Austria were not given a 
chance at all. The dismemberment of the country into four zones 
of occupation and a fifth Polish occupation zone seemed to be 
our fate. The Cold War prompted Washington to force through the 
establishment of two zones initially and then three zones 
despite considerable resistance from Paris. Even Saarland, 
which was considered war booty, escaped France's grasp under the 
minor reunification. 
  In the treaty on Germany, the three Western victors -- in 
the 
case of Britain and France, the price of "victory" was the loss 
of their empires -- undertook to support German unity with a 
light heart. U.S. policy proceeded from the assumption that the 
unification of western and central Germany would in any case 
never come about. Only a few far-sighted people such as the 
U.S. ambassador in Bonn, General Walters, foresaw that the GDR 
and Federal Republic would be united and even welcomed that. 
  For Margaret Thatcher and Francois Mitterrand, reunification 
was the worse possible evil. The two of them did all they could 
within their weak power to prevent the unification of western 
and central Germany, and did so in vain. Great Britain and 
France had exhausted their roles as great powers. Nevertheless, 
Mitterrand and Thatcher -- those "true friends" of the Federal 
Republic -- were able to force through the sanctioning of the 
Oder Neisse Line -- in other words, the crimes against humanity 
of genocide and mass expulsion that occurred in a quarter of 
Germany -- as part of the negotiating package at the time. 
<H5>  The Fettering of the German Giant </H5>
  Today, the FRG is by far the greatest power in Central and 
West Europe. All French and British political skills are 
directed toward -- to use Thatcher's language -- "chaining down 
Gulliver." This calculation assumes that the number one factor 
to the east of Germany, that is, Russia, will go back to a 
policy of opposition with regard to Bonn or Berlin, or will at 
least go along with game of "fettering the German giant" 
(Thatcher). However, if Moscow were to respect German interests 
in Central Europe and adopt a favorable or even friendly stance 
toward Germany, then Paris' and London's game of intrigue, 
designed to establish something of a large protectorate in the 
heart of Europe, would be doomed to fail. 
  Political friendship between peoples and states can by all 
means be cultivated with a view to being long-lasting or even 
"eternal." This kind of partnership endures all the more if one 
does not interfere in the domestic affairs of one's partner and 
in general concentrates on achieving a balance in those areas 
where there are joint interests. Relations between Russia and 
Kazakhstan will never be Berlin's business and neither do social 
and other circumstances in Russia concern us. 
  Europe's monarchs, especially those of Great Britain, 
Germany, and Russia, were related in many ways, including 
marriage. They nevertheless slid into World War I, which became 
an inferno for all. 
  On the other hand, when, at the end of the Seven Years' War, 
which Prussia seemed to have lost, Catherine II's Russia went 
over to supporting Prussia, Frederick the Great did not call on 
his savior to abolish serfdom in the greatest empire in the 
world. Let us consider another case: Imperial Foreign Minister 
Rathenau could certainly not have been suspected of being 
favorably disposed toward the Soviet Union when in 1922 he, 
along with the imperial chancellor at the time, Rath, made 
Rapallo possible, which meant that Germany no longer had its 
back against the wall. 
<H5>  Russia's Key Role </H5>
  Germany had the good fortune of being represented in St. 
Petersburg by particularly competent diplomats at key periods, 
namely, by Bismarck under the Czars, Schulenburg under Stalin, 
and Kroll under Khruschev. The establishment of the 1871 German 
Empire was only possible because the tsar was favorably disposed 
toward Bismarck and Germany and maintained benevolent 
neutrality. Europe could still have been a French colony today 
if Russia had not liberated us from Napoleon's yoke of terror. 
  Murderous World War II seemed to make any kind of sensible 
association between Germany and Russia impossible. However, 
present-day historical research confirms the views of the 
pioneering Prof. Diwald, who maintained that Stalin's policies 
were directed toward a single Germany and those of the Western 
powers toward its division. The rejection of Stalin's note on 
Germany in 1952 by Adenauer, who refused any kind of closer 
consideration of the issue let alone negotiations, prevented the 
unification of western and central Germany a decade after World 
War II in every possible way. 
  The big question was when would the Soviet Union or Russia 
be 
led by politicians whose policies would see German unity as 
being compatible with Moscow's interests. The security service 
chief Beria, who was despicable in every other respect, is 
supposed to have pursued such ideas before he was killed. 
Malenkov was considered to have been an advocate of a 
pro-German policy, but he left the inner circles of power. With 
Gorbachev, the course of history began to shift in the 
Bismarckian sense and Kohl made use that in 1990, at the end of 
which Gorbachev had to step down. 
  The fact that today, as at one time in the past, Russian 
policy -- and this practically applies to all parties -- 
involves defending Serbia's interests, whereas German policy, 
now as in the past, is geared toward Slovenia and Croatia does 
not have to be a misfortune if it results in possible and 
necessary compromises. No side has the right to dominate the 
other or even to tell it what to do. 
  In the Duma, among all the Russian parties, including the 
communists, the postwar prejudices against Germany are being 
eroded. When Zhirinovskiy, the leader of what is by far the 
strongest Russian party, propagates a solution to the East 
Prussia question that favors Germany, he is paving the way to a 
return to old German-Russian friendship, which was a blessing 
for our two nations for hundreds of years. Bonn politicians 
invoke Lithuanian, Polish, and French "interests in East 
Prussia." In doing so, they call to mind the unfortunate "all 
Germany" Minister Wilms, who, shortly before reunification, 
demanded that the GDR should only be united with the Federal 
Republic when, in addition to the four victorious powers, all 
our neighbors without exception express their agreement. 
  Zhirinovskiy's plan for Germany, which has been put down in 
writing -- including the famous lines that were drawn on the map 
belonging to the diplomat Rolf Gauffin, who was himself an 
ambassador in Moscow at one time -- envisages a completely 
peaceful revision of the Oder Neisse Line achieved through 
negotiations. Eastern Pomerania, West and East Prussia, and 
Silesia should be returned to Germany, while Poland would 
receive a corridor to the Baltic between Danzig and Koenigsberg 
as well as a large area around Lemberg, which lies outside its 
borders today. 
<H5>  The Revision of Oder Neisse Line </H5>
  The German eastern territories have really been no blessing 
for Warsaw. Zhirinovskiy's plan for Germany is a new version of 
the old, traditional pro-German policy in Moscow or St. 
Petersburg. It must be recognized as a fact that generally 
arguments between Russian politicians are accompanied by violent 
exchanges of words that tend to get out of control, exchanges 
that are more reminiscent of clashes with sabers than fencing 
with foils, and by the same token it must also be recognized 
that what is "cultivated" on all sides in Bonn is a political 
jargon that is completely incomprehensible to the people. 
  In keeping with Lenin's words that "trust is good, but 
control is better," no sensible person is going to entertain 
illusions that paradise will be established in Europe in the 
near future. A quick look at Sarajevo shows how serious the 
situation is. This makes the constant reductions in the size 
and weaponry of the Bundeswehr, especially the splitting up of 
the Bundeswehr and placing it under foreign command, all the 
more incomprehensible. We do need a strong Army under German 
command, but we will no longer tolerate the presence of foreign 
troops in Germany. NATO's sole task increasingly appears to be 
that of depriving Germany of its rights. 
  There might be circles in the "Western honorable society" 
who 
want to make a bogey man or monster out of Zhirinovskiy, for 
example to give a boost to the defense industry, to create a new 
potential enemy, and bring about a return to the Cold War, which 
will see an even deeper gulf separating use from our old friend 
Russia. There can scarcely be another explanation for such a 
degree of rabble- rousing propaganda and condemnation, one that 
is based on stupefying the masses, for which Stalinism is 
supposed to be the same thing as communism, which is in turn the 
same thing as Russia. However, German interests require 
categorically that a serious effort be repeatedly made in the 
East and the West to make it clear to politicians that the 
fundamental interests of our people are completely compatible 
with their own interests.

<F P=106> [Report by "fy": "Ammunition `Probably Never Existed'"] </F>
  [Text] Hamburg, 20 Feb -- The Federal Government 
apparently does not intend to urge the Western Group of Russian 
Armed Forces in Germany (WGT) or the Russian Government to 
quickly clarify the whereabouts of 81,000 tonnes of ammunition, 
which is still stored in the Russian ammunition depots in the 
new laender, according to the Russian Armed Forces. Upon an 
inquiry, the Foreign Ministry expressed the suspicion that the 
ammunition in question "probably" never existed -- at least, it 
was "probably not" stored in the depots of the Russian Army in 
Germany. Also, it is considered completely "unlikely" that it 
was buried on the vast training area. Questions as to whether 
the government wants to know exactly what happened with the 
ammunition have been answered evasively. 
  In the Finance Ministry, which is responsible for the 
property returned by the Russians, the report gave rise to fears 
that the new laender might refuse to assume responsibility for 
the property. The laender do not want the risk of taking back 
land contaminated by ammunition and, thus, be responsible for 
the disposal of toxic waste. The leadership of the Defense 
Ministry has issued a decree forbidding the passing on of 
information to the public about problems resulting from the 
ammunition and about violations of existing agreements that 
might be discovered in the future. In addition, the Bundeswehr 
is not allowed to approach the Western Group of Russian Armed 
Forces -- as in the past -- if deviations from existing 
agreements are noticed. This is the exclusive task of the 
Foreign Ministry.

<F P=106> [Report by "DeT": "Aviation Negotiations Without Result"] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- The German-American aviation 
negotiations in Washington have collapsed. After two weeks of 
negotiations, the German delegation left without having achieved 
a result. Therefore, the planned alliance between Lufthansa and 
the largest U.S. carrier, United Airlines, continues to be 
blocked. 
  The talks were supposed to complete the elementary agreement 
achieved in September. However, the U.S. Administration made 
use of some technical gaps to torpedo the agreement. Until the 
very last moment, the delegation from the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT) demanded that U.S. airlines once again 
receive unlimited access to the German market. Lufthansa rights 
in the United States, on the other hand, were to be restricted. 
  Before the departure, the Federal Government once again 
offered comprehensive concessions to the U.S. side, among others 
in the field of the so-called third-country code sharing as well 
as regarding the number of permissible weekly frequencies. A 
U.S. response has not yet been received. Thus, the conditions 
of the elementary agreement remain valid, which results in 
disadvantages for both sides. Lufthansa now cannot cooperate 
with United. However, the Americans also have their hands tied: 
The number of weekly flights that Northwest wants to offer 
together with KLM from the United States via Amsterdam to 
Germany is limited to 140. In addition, only one U.S. airline 
may offer code sharing flights with a third-country airline 
beyond the FRG. In addition, the weekly frequencies across the 
North Atlantic will be frozen at the level of last October. 
  A leading airline lobbyist in Washington said that "we are 
all losers in this situation." The decisive point for the 
unsatisfactory result was the influence of Delta Airline 
lobbyists in Washington. Via a complaint, Delta had demanded 
more rights for its own dispatching at Frankfurt airport. If 
these rights are not granted, the entire agreement should become 
pointless, it was argued. 
<H5>  Disadvantage for Lufthansa </H5>
  For Lufthansa, which sees the cooperation agreement as an 
important building block on its path toward recovery, this limbo 
is particularly critical. The German state airline expects 
code-sharing across the North Atlantic to provide it with many 
times the additional revenues that it would lose in European 
business as a result of concessions to the Americans. DOT 
circles speak of up to 1 billion German marks. United Airlines 
is also disappointed about the collapse of the talks. A 
spokesman said in Washington that "the American attitude was 
intolerable right down to the last minute and violates the 
spirit of free trade."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "ZDF Political Barometer: `Danger of </F>
Losses Increases for the FDP'"] 
  [Text] In view of the current critical economic situation, 
the readiness for reducing demands in wage negotiations is very 
high in Germany, and support for possible strikes is only weak. 
This has been revealed by the February poll of the Mannheim 
research group dealing with elections. It was carried out among 
2,000 citizens in the east and west for the political barometer 
of the ZDF. A total of 82 percent of Germans in the old and 76 
percent in the new laender believe that wage increases should be 
renounced at present if jobs can be saved in this way; 13 
percent of west Germans and 20 percent of east Germans favored 
wage increases irrespective of the impact on the labor market. 
<H5>  Against Strikes </H5>
  Against this backdrop, little support for strikes in the 
metal working industry is noticeable in the west (in the east, 
the question was not asked for reasons of time): Only 25 
percent would approve of efforts by the trade unions to achieve 
their demands through strikes; 70 percent opposse it. This 
clear rejection is noticeable among supporters of all parties. 
At 42 percent, the largest degree of approval of strikes has 
been observed among Green voters. 
  The general political atmosphere has changed in different 
ways in eastern and western Germany in February. Above all, it 
is remarkable that the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] 
has for the first time since the 1990 Bundestag elections 
dropped below the 5-percent mark in both eastern and western 
Germany. The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union 
[CDU/CSU] is clearly winning support in western Germany but 
losing in eastern Germany. Nationwide, it would receive 35 
percent (4 percent more than in January). For the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the mood in the east and west 
has deteriorated. It has lost 2 percent and stands now at 42 
percent. The FDP can rely on 4 percent (- 1 percent). 
Alliance 90/The Greens are losing slightly in the west and 
clearly winning in the east. At present, they can rely on 11 
percent support (+ 1 percent). All the other parties together 
received 9 percent (- 1 percent), including the Republikaner at 
an unchanged 2 percent and the Party of Democratic Socialism 
[PDS] at 4 percent, as in January. 
  These figures represent the current political mood in 
Germany. If a new Bundestag were elected at this point, the 
German citizens would attach more significance to long-term 
fundamental political convictions. Without taking into 
consideration the current mood, the question "For which party 
would you vote if the Bundestag elections were held next 
Sunday," revealed the following picture: CDU/CSU 37 percent 
(+ 1 percent), SPD 39 percent (no change), FDP 6 percent (no 
change), Alliance 90/The Greens 9 percent (- 1 percent), and 
other parties 9 percent (no change), including the Republikaner 
at 4 and the PDS at 3 percent. Thus, at 48 percent, a coalition 
between the SPD and the Greens would enjoy a parliamentary 
majority in February. 
<H5>  Good Rating for Bluem </H5>
  Satisfaction with the work of the government further 
increased in eastern and western Germany -- measured on the 
basis of a scale reaching from + 5 (very satisfied) to - 5 
(very dissatisfied): Figures improved from - 1.2 in December 
to - 1.0 in January and to - 0.9 at present. The achievements 
of the SPD as opposition in Bonn, however, showed a less 
favorable trend -- 0.2 in December 1993, 0.1 in January, and 0.0 
in February. 
  Not only the government but the chancellor personally are 
being assessed better than four weeks ago. Nationwide, Helmut 
Kohl received a rating of - 0.3 following - 0.4 in January. 
Norbert Bluem also improved his rating -- from 0.5 to 0.6. The 
overall assessment of Theo Waigel has clearly deteriorated -- 
from - 0.4 to - 0.7, and that of Wolfgang Schaeuble from 1.0 
to 0.7. The rating for Rita Suessmuth has slightly deteriorated 
from 1.0 to 0.9. 
<H5>  Little Sympathy for Rau </H5>
  Klaus Kinkel received 0.4 percent (0.5 percent in January). 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whom the population still considers one 
of the most important German politicians, was the most popular 
figure in eastern and western Germany in February: He scored 
2.5 percent (after 2.6 in January). 
  Rudolf Scharping's popularity has again declined slightly 
(December 1.3 percent, January 1.1 percent, February 1.0 
percent). Johannes Rau suffered a severe setback: His rating 
declined from 1.9 to 1.4. The approval rating for Regine 
Hildebrandt, the Social Democrat minister from Brandenburg, who 
is only known to 57 percent of the population, deteriorated 
slightly from 1.7 in January to 1.6 in February. 
  Who should be chancellor of Germany? The share of those who 
would like to leave everything unchanged has again increased in 
February. In December, 31 percent wanted Helmut Kohl to head 
the government, in January 34 percent, and in February 36 
percent. However, the majority still voted in favor of his 
challenger Rudolf Scharping. The number of those who do not 
know has further decreased from 18 percent in December to 15 
percent in January and 13 percent in February. Support for 
Scharping is clearly greater in the east than in the west. For 
Kohl, it is the other way round. 
  When asked about the desired president, the population 
prefers Johannes Rau after the official nomination of Roman 
Herzog as the candidate of the CDU/CSU: A total of 25 percent 
would like him to succeed Richard von Weizsaecker; 12 percent 
support Roman Herzog and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and 5 percent 
Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. Every third German is still undecided 
on this issue. 
  The general economic situation in eastern Germany was 
assessed slightly worse in February than in January: A total of 
54 percent (52 percent in January) consider the situation bad; 
43 percent believe that it is partly good and partly bad, and 3 
percent think that it is good. As far as competence for a 
solution to the economic problems in eastern Germany is 
concerned, an SPD-led government is considered clearly more 
capable of achieving that than the present coalition. A total 
of 35 percent of east Germans consider the Social Democrats more 
capable of overcoming the crisis; 21 percent trust in the 
present government, and 11 percent assess both as the same. Yet 
nearly a third (32 percent) do not think anything of this 
alternative. 
<H5>  Bad Marks for the European Union </H5>
  A far-reaching adaptation of living conditions in the east 
to 
the level of the western laender has so far not been achieved in 
the view of the population (91 percent). The assessment is 
slightly more optimistic in the old laender. The west Germans 
are also more confident about the question of when the 
adaptation will largely be completed; 31 percent believe that a 
maximum of five years will be required, 47 percent think that 
this process will last five to 10 years, and 16 percent believe 
that it will take even longer. In eastern Germany, every fifth 
citizen expects the adaptation to be completed in five years' 
time; 56 percent consider a period of five to 10 years 
necessary, and 23 percent consider more than 10 years necessary. 
  Four months before the next European elections, a negative 
assessment of the European Union prevails: Only 15 percent 
believe that membership in the European Union brings more 
advantages than disadvantages for the German population; 45 
percent think that advantages and disadvantages outweigh each 
other, but 35 percent see more disadvantages. In the east, the 
assessment is even more unfavorable than in the west. Moreover, 
most Germans (72 percent in the west and 73 percent in the east) 
feel that they are not sufficiently informed about the European 
Union. 
  In view of the skeptical assessment of the European Union, 
the majority of Germans favor settling problems by individual 
states. A total of 73 percent believe that, above all, the 
governments of the individual countries should adopt measures to 
curb unemployment. Those polled expressed similar preferences 
concerning economic development: A total of 61 percent want the 
government to deal with this issue. As far as the fight against 
crime is concerned, 55 percent favor initiatives by their own 
government. Only in the sphere of foreign and security policy 
does a majority want a European-Union-wide solution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CDU Losses Higher Than Ever"] </F>
  [Text] An unprecedented political landslide is imminent in 
the five new laender if 11 million men and women vote in the 
Landtag elections this year in the same way they would vote if 
these elections were held now. 
  For decades there had never been any double-digit losses for 
any party at German Landtag elections. The first time this 
happened was at the elections in Bremen in September 1991, when 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] plummeted from 50.5 
to 38.8 percent, a decline of 11.7 percent. Two years later the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] lost 10 percent in the 
elections in Hamburg. 
  Now virtually devastating defeats are in the offing for the 
CDU in eastern Germany. In all likelihood, it will sink like a 
plane whose engines have failed at the Landtag elections there. 
  At the moment its losses, compared with the Landtag 
elections 
of 14 October 1990, are between 13 percent in Brandenburg and 21 
percent in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, as a poll conducted by 
the Bielefeld Emnid Institute for DER SPIEGEL at the beginning 
of February showed. According to this poll, the CDU has lost 
1.2 million voters. 
  In three laender the party lost half of its followers. It 
keeps only meager remnants of 20 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, 17 
percent in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, and 16 percent in 
Brandenburg. There is no western land where the CDU is as weak; 
even in Hamburg it gets as much as 25.1 percent. 
  In Thuringia, too, where the CDU missed the absolute 
majority 
in the Landtag by only one seat in the 1990 elections, it has 
now fallen behind the SPD. Only in Saxony, where in 1990 one 
out of two people voted for the CDU and just one out of five for 
the SPD, the CDU is the strongest party, according to Emnid. 
However, the distance between CDU and SPD has shrunk from 34.7 
percent at the previous elections to 8 percent now. 
  The reason for this debacle: Too many people trusted 
Chancellor Kohl, who won the election campaigns in 1990 with the 
promise that the former GDR would turn into "flourishing 
landscapes within four or five years." 
  Already a few weeks later the mood sobered. At the beginning 
of March the CDU had sunk to 24 percent in eastern Germany, and 
even though there have been a few fluctuations since then, it 
has never recovered from this low. 
  In Saxony Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf has not been 
able to prevent his party's losses, only reduce them. And he 
managed that only because he is one of the most popular German 
heads of government. 
  Saxony's CDU voters revere him like their compatriots used 
to 
revere August the Strong [1670-1733, elector of Saxony]. He 
reached plus 4.1 on the plus 5/minus 5 popularity scale -- more 
is hardly possible, not even President von Weizsaecker gets such 
excellent marks. Even Saxony's SPD voters like the CDU head of 
government better than the head of the SPD opposition in the 
Landtag. 
  For many Saxons the head of government is rather removed 
from 
everyday politics. If one asks about Biedenkopf's policy, far 
more men and women express a positive view than if one asks 
about the policy of the land government -- as if the 
minister-president did not sit in government but rested on a 
throne above it. 
  According to Emnid, the Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] declined from 8 percent in July 1993 to 5 percent in 
October 1993 and to 3 percent now. However, even if it got into 
the Landtag again, the CDU and the FDP together would not get 
the majority. From today's point of view, Biedenkopf could only 
enter into a grand coalition with the SPD; unless he allied 
himself with the Greens -- which is more a subject for 
soothsayers than for analysts at the moment. 
  In Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, and Mecklenburg-Western 
Pomerania a change of power will very likely take place after 
the elections. 
  In Brandenburg, where Manfred Stolpe is as popular as 
Biedenkopf in Saxony, the SPD won so many new followers that it 
will probably no longer need two partners for a majority but can 
choose between the Greens and the FDP. 
  Not only in Saxony is the FDP worse off in 1994 than it was 
in 1990. Apart from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and 
Brandenburg, it has lost strongly everywhere. While it seems to 
be certain that it will remain in the Bundestag (currently 8 
percent each in east and west), it must struggle for survival in 
at least two Landtag elections. 
  In contrast to general assumption, the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS] does not have far more followers than in the 
past all over the former GDR but only in Brandenburg. The 
Greens have improved their position and can hope for 
double-digit results in all laender. It is also new that the 
Republikaner are slightly below or above 5 percent in four 
laender. 
  Polls such as the current one -- with 2,500 people polled, 
distributed equally and representatively across the five laender 
-- do not allow for precise forecasts for smaller parties. 
Therefore, 3 percent does not mean the certain end of the FDP 
in Saxony, and 5 percent for the Republikaner in Thuringia and 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania does not mean certain success. 
  Some results of the poll even permit the conclusion that 
the Republikaner have more or less exhausted their potential and 
will, in the end, fail in all five Landtag elections: 
  Only a few isolated followers of other parties cited the 
Republikaner, when they were asked which party they like "second 
best." Large majorities put it in "the last place." Apart from 
their own followers, only a very few of those polled would 
"welcome" the success of the Republikaner. And, in the east, 
the PDS is the protest party; it collects many dissatisfied and 
disappointed people, in addition to ultrareactionaries. 
  The only alarm signal: Among the younger voters between 18 
and 30 there are far more followers and sympathizers of 
Schoenhuber's party than there are among the older voters. 
  The election campaign has not yet begun in the five laender. 
The Landtage will be elected in Saxony-Anhalt on 26 June, in 
Saxony and probably also in Brandenburg on 11 September, in 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Thuringia (just a the 
Bundestag) on 16 October. 
  However, things will probably not change very much until 
then, because "right now there is not the slightest indication 
of new developments," Emnid expert Klaus-Peter Schoeppner notes. 
  For many months unemployment has been the main topic in the 
east; in contrast to the west, no other problem -- such as the 
large number of asylum-seekers -- has been accorded similar 
importance. 
  And for quite some time it has not been the CDU but the SPD 
that is considered to be the party "best able to combat 
unemployment."

<F P=106> [Report by "-ng": "FDP Wants Reduction of Cabinet"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Hildesheim -- On Saturday [26 February] the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] came out in favor of reducing 
the cabinet by two ministers. 
  At the "small party congress" of the FDP in Hildesheim the 
majority of the delegates adopted a guiding motion for merging 
the Ministry of Women and Youth and the Ministry of Family and 
the Elderly. In addition, the Ministry of Research and 
Technology and the Ministry of Education are to be merged. 
  Regarding its statement on a coalition following the 
Bundestag election on 16 October, the FDP does not want to let 
itself be pressured by the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. Its chairman, FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, stressed in Hildesheim that a 
corresponding statement will be made only after the summer 
recess: "We do not let anything be imposed on us." 
  On Friday CSU Chairman Theo Waigel had called on the FDP to 
commit itself to the CDU/CSU as a coalition partner in Bonn 
before the election of a new president and had announced that, 
if the FDP does not do so, the CDU/CSU would pursue an election 
campaign against the FDP. 
  The FDP chairman harshly criticized the SPD. The SPD has 
"swallowed foreign policy chalk," Kinkel said. He will 
"remind" SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping "again and again that his 
party is blocking the urgently necessary amendment to the Basic 
Law for blue-helmet missions by the Bundeswehr." The SPD is not 
capable of ruling. The red-green coalition in Lower Saxony has 
proved to be a "discontinuing model." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["deu/gio" report: "Greens Favor Change of Power in </F>
Coalition With the SPD"] 
  [Text] Mannheim -- The Alliance 90/Greens enter the 1994 
election year with a clear commitment to a red-green government 
coalition. At its federal delegates' conference in Mannheim the 
party adopted an election program -- with only one vote against 
-- with which an "ecological and social change in course" in 
Germany is to be introduced. 
  There was a heated quarrel between the realpolitik wing and 
the leftists about the future foreign policy course. Finally, 
the majority affirmed the party's basic pacifist attitude. The 
delegates approved a motion by the Federal Executive Committee, 
which came out in favor of a gradual dissolution of the 
Bundeswehr and of NATO as well as against any German 
participation in blue- helmet missions. A moderate 
countermotion by Krista Sager was clearly rejected. As a 
result, Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], accused the Greens in an 
interview of letting the fundamentalists continue to have the 
say in the party. 
  A focal issue of the party congress was the economic and 
social policy. The delegates came out in favor of new 
ecological taxes, a drastic reduction of work time, and basic 
care for all needy people. In compensation for the ecological 
taxes, companies should get subsidies for environmentally 
friendly investments. With higher taxes on large assets an 
equalization of burdens, in particular for the benefit of the 
east, is intended. Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer 
warned in vain against the demand of getting out of nuclear 
energy within two years. In practical government work this 
"immediatism" just leads to disappointed hopes, Fischer said. 
  In asylum policy the motion by representatives of the party 
leftists, which demanded the retraction of the asylum laws, 
failed. Lower Saxony's Federal Council Minister Juergen Trittin 
harshly attacked Wolfgang Schaeuble. Trittin accused the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union group chairman 
in the Bundestag of having overtaken Republikaner Chairman Franz 
Schoenhuber on the right. At the same time, he accused the SPD 
in Lower Saxony, where elections will be held on 13 March, of 
pursuing an election campaign against its own election program: 
"Anyone who wants to replace Kohl must prevent Schroeder from 
becoming an absolute ruler in Lower Saxony," Trittin said. 
  At the party congress there was unanimous agreement on 
striving for a change of power in the coalition with the SPD. 
The preamble of the program says: "We are ready to contribute 
ourselves with all our strength to a government coalition, if 
this promises a serious reform policy. However, there will not 
be a coalition at any cost," Executive Committee spokesman 
Ludger Volmer said. On Sunday the delegates recognized the 
"Green Alternative Youth Alliance," which was founded in 
January, as the party's youth organization.

  [Text] The right-wing party Alliance of Free Citizens 
founded by former Bavarian Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] Chairman Manfred Brunner wants to open itself up to former 
members of "extreme-right parties." This follows from a party 
resolution that is attached to the applications for membership. 
  Former members of extreme-right rival parties who want to 
join the Alliance of Free Citizens need only to have left their 
previous organization "some time ago." The Alliance of Free 
Citizens, which collects an admission fee of 250 German marks, 
currently has only 120 members; Chairman Brunner is confronted 
with a charge of "sedition" because he is said to have put 
Bonn's European policy on a level with racism during the Nazi 
era. 
  Brunner had already invited Manfred Rouhs, 29, spokesman of 
the new Right and publisher of the ultraconservative strategy 
magazine EUROPA VORN, to his party's federal assembly in Bonn 
the Sunday before last. Rouhs and his adherents are already 
beating the drum for using the Alliance of Free Citizens, which 
does not have many members, for the benefit of their own 
political objectives.

<F P=106> [Report by "enn": "Trust Agency Companies Lay Off 34,000"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin, 23 Feb -- This year the Trust Agency 
companies will lay off about 34,000 of their 149,000 employees 
for operational reasons. This is the result of a Trust Agency 
poll. However, part of this personnel reduction has already been 
implemented, the Trust Agency announced in Berlin on Wednesday 
[23 February]. The Trust Agency thus refuted reports that in 
Saxony-Anhalt alone 22,000 lay-offs are imminent and in 
Thuringia 10,000. Even the 29,000 employees of Trust Agency 
companies that are in the process of being liquidated are not 
all affected by lay-offs, it is said, because so far one-third 
of the jobs in liquidated companies have been preserved. In 
addition, the Trust Agency points out that not all of those 
laid-off will be released into the labor market. More than half 
of those who have been dismissed so far have been included in 
labor market policy measures. Before the beginning of 
privatization in 1990, about 4 million people had worked in 
Trust Agency companies. Today the proportion of Trust Agency 
employees in the overall number of people employed in eastern 
Germany is only 2.9 percent. Two-thirds of the remaining 
149,000 employees work in companies still to be privatized, 
including 22,000 in management companies. A total of 19,000 
people work in companies that have already been sold. In 
addition, 15,000 people are employed in brown coal improvement 
companies, which will probably be financed until 1997 via 
Article 249h of the Labor Promotion Law.

<F P=106> [Interview with Han Halevi, PLO delegate to the Socialist </F>
International in Paris, by Henri Vernet; place and date not 
given: "`Israel Must Disarm Settlers and Evacuate Settlements'"] 
  [Text] Han Halevi, the PLO delegate to the Socialist 
International in Paris, was one of the key figures in the 
rapprochement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, which 
last year ended up with the secret agreement in Oslo. In his 
opinion, the only way to save the peace process is to initiate 
talks immediately on the fate of the Jewish settlements in the 
occupied territories, and to begin evacuating them. "The 
settlers," Halevi feels, "have got it into their head to prevent 
the application" of the interim autonomy agreements and the 
"Israeli Government has so far not had the courage to prove them 
wrong." That is what must now change. 
  [Vernet] According to the Israelis, the Hebron massacre was 
an "isolated act," and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin even called 
the person responsible for it a "psychopath." The PLO, however, 
sees in it a plot involving some 30 settlers. Why? 
  [Halevi] Since yesterday morning, Palestinian witnesses have 
reported that there were "several gunmen." In addition, it is 
difficult to believe that a lone gunman, even with a machine 
gun, could have left so many victims. That is the first point. 
  The second suspicious aspect is the speed and insistence 
with 
which the Israelis -- from the head of government to the 
ambassadors, like the one here in Paris -- tried to push through 
the version that this was the act of a lone madman. And they 
did this before the inquiry had even gotten under way there! 
  [Vernet] Who could be implicated in this attack? Do the 
settlers have links with the Israeli Army? 
  [Halevi] I believe that there are elements within the 
Israeli 
Army which are seeking to add fuel to the flames. The country's 
press has already mentioned it. There are officers capable of 
doing this kind of thing in an effort to derail the peace 
process. 
  [Vernet] Do you feel that the responsibility for the 
massacre 
lies at this level? 
  [Halevi] No, it is the Israeli Government itself which is 
clearly responsible. Since the signing of the 
Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principle in Washington, the 
Rabin government has made no clear statements about the 
settlers. Even worse, it has let the settlers believe that they 
have the power to block the peace process. They demonstrated 
this bloodily yesterday. 
  [Vernet] Did they succeed? Is the Oslo process definitively 
grounded? 
  [Halevi] Everything depends on the reaction and attitude of 
the Israeli Government. The ball is in its court, not in the 
settlers'. Rabin cannot be content with making condemnations, 
there must be suppression, arrests, imprisonments, and sentences 
so that light can be shed on any collusion wherever it may be 
found. And of course the settlers must be disarmed. Otherwise, 
the entire peace process will be discredited once and for all. 
  [Vernet] Exactly, so should we not once again question the 
feasibility of the Oslo agreement? 
  [Halevi] The great weakness in this agreement is primarily 
the fact that the way was left clear for the Israelis to 
postpone "sine die" the talks on the future of the settlements 
and the status of the settlers. This is what they have been 
seeking since the beginning: Gaining time on the ground and not 
tackling the matter before the final phase of the negotiations, 
which will be lay down the definitive status of the occupied 
territories, because the Rabin government fears nothing more 
than a wide-ranging public debate by Israeli society on these 
settlements. 
  It had been noticed well before yesterday's massacre that it 
is the presence of the settlers that is the main obstacle to the 
application of the Oslo agreement. 
  [Vernet] Why this hesitancy? 
  [Halevi] For so many years, their leaders have hammered home 
to the Israelis that by settling in the occupied territories 
they were merely exercising their "sacred right." For Likud and 
the religious groups, it was the sacred right to the land. For 
the Labor Party and the pragmatists, it was the Israeli people's 
right to security and self-defense. That is how they justified 
the supposedly irreversible fait accompli of the settlements. 
  Today, the government has to explain to the Israelis that it 
always lied to them and that they have no divine right to occupy 
the land of others. 
  [Vernet] In concrete terms, do the Palestinian negotiators 
have the resources to force their Israeli counterparts to 
discuss the fate of the Jewish settlements? 
  [Halevi] Yes, because according to the terms of the Oslo 
agreement, i.e., the declaration of principle signed on 13 
September at the White House, the negotiations on the definitive 
status must begin "as soon as possible" -- and in any case no 
later than two years after the implementation of the interim 
autonomy agreement. So, the soonest possible is today. We must 
begin these talks and begin evacuating the settlements before 
this problem blows up in our faces once and for all. 
  [Vernet] Is that the substance of the appeal made by 'Arafat 
to the United Nations? 
  [Halevi] The immediate objective of taking recourse to the 
United Nations is to have emergency measures taken to protect 
the Palestinians not only from the settlers, but also from the 
Israeli Army. The Europeans must assume their responsibility 
within the Security Council -- and the Americans must not use 
their veto -- in order to define the ways and means for 
international intervention in the occupied territories. 
  [Vernet] So far, the Security Council, although it has 
recently passed resolutions condemning Israel, has never passed 
any sanctions against it. It has never imposed any decisions on 
the Jewish state which Israel feels are unacceptable...as the 
deployment of an peace-keeping force might be? 
  [Halevi] This odious massacre could give the international 
community the chance to tell the Israeli leadership clearly and 
firmly: Do not indulge the settlers or be weak with them, and 
make a commitment to evacuating the occupied territories. In 
short, the Security Council must prevent the Israelis from 
sabotaging that which they themselves have committed themselves 
to doing. As early as last 13 December, Israel showed the world 
that it does not keep its word, by flouting the schedule 
provided for in the Oslo agreement (which made provisions for 
the beginning of Israeli's military withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho on 13 December.) 
  [Vernet] Two years ago, U.S. President George Bush refused 
to 
grant credit guarantees to the Jewish state, precisely because 
the Shamir (then in power in Jerusalem) government's 
continuation of the settlement process threatened the peace 
process. Will Bill Clinton prove to be just as firm? 
  [Halevi] That is hard to say, especially since the Clinton 
administration has granted credits to Shamir's successor, Rabin. 
Yet, Rabin has only met half of the American demands which were 
based on -- it must not be forgotten -- international law. 
Indeed, the celebrated "freeze" decided by the Labor Party only 
regards one part of the settlements, since settlements are 
continuing in so-called security zones, and especially in 
"greater Jerusalem." Nevertheless, we must hope that the Clinton 
administration will prove to be firm toward its protege.

<F P=106> [Interview with the Assembly's Defense Commission Chairman </F>
Jacques Boyon by Jacques Patoz; place and date not given: 
"Jacques Boyon: `What Is Implied Is More Important Than What Is 
Written"] 
  [Text] [Patoz] Last Wednesday [23 February] the government 
submitted a white paper on defense to the Defense Commissions of 
the National Assembly and the Senate . What is your overall 
opinion of this document? 
  [Boyon] Like most of the other deputies who listened to the 
prime minister and the defense minister, I was very satisfied 
overall with the presentation that was made of the white paper. 
In the present context of budgetary stringency, we were fearing 
we might end up with a skimpy white paper. We were reassured to 
see that a certain number of our national defense objectives 
were confirmed. Having said this, drawing up this document was 
not the most difficult part of the exercise since its aim was to 
define a long-term military policy. This must now be translated 
into real figures. We are now waiting to see how the government 
will overcome this difficulty. 
  [Patoz] The white paper confirms the need for nuclear 
deterrence, but it does not deal with the issue of resuming 
nuclear tests. However, many members of the majority are 
declaring themselves in favor of resuming such tests. What are 
your feelings in this respect? 
  [Boyon] As regards the nuclear chapter, the white paper has 
left us somewhat unsatisfied. Apparently, they attempted to 
evade a number of questions which, within the cohabitation 
framework, do not elicit the same response from the government 
as they do from the president of the Republic. However, we must 
be aware that we have, on the one hand, the white paper's letter 
and, on the other, what is implied. Now, these implications are 
important, and we feel this was confirmed by the prime 
minister's comments. 
  For my part, I believe it is apparent from everything that 
was said that the nuclear deterrent is still the basis of our 
defense. I also believe that the government recognizes that our 
nuclear arsenal must be modernized to keep pace with the 
development of new threats. In my view, the government 
reaffirmed -- even though this is not actually spelt out in the 
white paper -- the need to resume nuclear testing at the 
earliest possible date, in order to complete the development of 
the PALEN test simulation system. All in all, it is true that 
the white paper does not say much which is new on the nuclear 
issue but, frankly, we were not expecting it to do so. In fact, 
we are very much aware that the broad guidelines for the 
development of our deterrent system will only be set down by the 
next president. 
  [Patoz] As far as arms policy is concerned, the white paper 
pronounces itself in favor of basing production on international 
cooperation. Do you approve of this formula? 
  [Boyon] In my view, the white paper is not saying that 
France 
must give up certain programs, but rather, that it cannot do 
everything on its own. The white paper says that the need to 
cut back on costs requires cooperative projects to be 
undertaken, except in the nuclear field, where sharing is not 
possible. I believe this is the way forward. Any other 
position would be totally unrealistic. 
  It is not a question of concentrating on a certain type of 
production, and leaving some other type of production to other 
countries. We are not saying "we must give up doing this," but 
rather "we must do this with others." In the final analysis, 
industrialists will be playing a decisive role in determining 
how things will be organized. 
  [Patoz] The white paper seems to signal the beginning of a 
certain rapprochement with NATO. Is this not calling into 
question one of the great Gaullist principles? 
  [Boyon] Not at all. Both the white paper and the comments 
made by the prime minister confirm that France will remain 
outside the integrated military system. If French troops are 
deployed, wherever they may be deployed, this will only happen 
following a decision of the French Government. What does 
constitute more of a novelty -- although, in this respect, the 
white paper is not so much innovating as it is recording a fact 
-- is that, whenever NATO engages in operations to maintain or 
reestablish peace, and if France takes part in them, it is 
normal for the defense minister to attend any political meetings 
which aim to define the objectives and the framework of such 
operations. 
  At present, there is a dividing line between the NATO bodies 
in which France takes part, and those in which it does not take 
part. We have simply realized that this dividing line is no 
longer in the right place, but we are not erasing it. Rather, 
we are moving it so that the defense minister and the chief of 
the general staff can take part in discussions whenever this 
proves necessary. 
  [Patoz] Whereas the RPR is inclined to establish a 
professional army, the white paper still favors a conscript 
army. What is your view of the matter? 
  [Boyon] The RPR did not declare itself in favor of a 
professional army, but rather of professionalizing the army, 
which is not exactly the same thing. However, the white paper 
does confirm the principle of conscription, but I do not think 
the real problem lies here. The problem today is knowing 
whether we can maintain conscription in an army which must 
become more professional. In fact, we are being told, on the 
one hand, that the armed forces will be made smaller and, on the 
other, that we will have more professionals within them. 
Therefore, there will be fewer conscripts. The question is 
therefore the following: Can we manage the national service 
machinery -- which is very cumbersome -- in such a way as to 
ensure that the principles of universality and equality are 
observed, and that the service's civilian sections do not 
continue to get hold of the best men, leaving the conscripts 
discarded by the civilian service managers to the armed forces? 
I am not sure this is possible. 
  The Defense Commisssion will now have to consider the 
national service issue. In fact, it is apparent that the white 
paper has proclaimed a principle without first ensuring that the 
necessary in-depth studies had been conducted on the 
possibilities of implementing it.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Reinhard: "Foreign Policy: End of </F>
Reserved Domain?"] 
  [Excerpts] No international issue in France gave rise to so 
much debate as the former Yugoslavia question, so much so that 
it has become a domestic policy issue. For the past three years, 
numerous politicians have either acquired or regained a 
reputation by staking positions on the Bosnian conflict. While 
it is impossible to doubt the good faith of those concerned with 
this situation, it must be admitted that many of our deputies 
used the Yugoslav tragedy more for their own purposes than to 
help the martyred population. 
  At a time when the situation in the field is modified by the 
stated will of the Western powers to intervene, the discretion 
observed by the professionals of humanitarian-military 
intervention should be noted. Everything is now occurring as if 
only one man is in charge of the issue, Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Alain Juppe, who is putting a new face on cohabitation. 
The president and the prime minister remain silent, letting 
Juppe--and, to a certain extent, [Minister of Defense] Francois 
Leotardl--occupy first place, a situation not devoid of 
political and institutional consequences. 
  It has been clear for 10 months that the "reserved domain" 
no 
longer exists. The second cohabitation has profoundly modified 
the distribution of responsibilities between the Elysee 
[presidential office], Matignon [prime minister's office] and 
the government. No longer does the president possess all the 
power in military and diplomatic matters. The "reserved domain," 
which does not exist on paper but has been constant practice 
since 1958, is now the "shared domain." Foreign policy handling 
has provoked no incidents since the advent of the Edouard 
Balladur government. The essential agreement between the 
president and the prime minister on important issues such as the 
GATT, but also the will of the two men to avoid messing up 
France's image following a political confrontation, have allowed 
France to speak with one voice. 
<H5>  Shared Domain </H5>
  This does not mean that the Elysee and Matignon are in sync 
on all foreign policy or defense issues, as illustrated by the 
nuclear testing question, where it was indicative that the 
criticism expressed by part of the majority was directed at 
Edouard Balladur more than at Francois Mitterrand. Those within 
the Right who contest the "shared domain" are accusing Matignon 
and no longer the Elysee. Thus, foreign policy has become a 
domestic policy issue within the majority. 
  If the competition between the two heads of the executive 
branch was obvious in foreign affairs between 1986 and 1988, the 
second cohabitation is characterized by the absence of 
confrontation--at least publicly--in this field. This situation 
renders Matignon and the Elysee relatively discreet. The 
minister of foreign affairs thus is called upon to be much more 
present on the media scene than his predecessors, all the more 
so since, in Alain Juppe's case, he is not the spokesman for 
Matignon, nor, of course, for the Elysee. [passage omitted] With 
regard to the Bosnian conflict, it seems that Juppe is the true 
head of the general staff, alone on the front lines and seconded 
only by Francois Leotard. 
<H5>  Super Star </H5>
  Juppe never misses a chance to note that he handles the 
issue 
in perfect accord with the president and the prime minister. 
However, Mitterrand and Balladur's silence leave the starring 
role to Juppe, omnipresent on radio and television and seemingly 
the only leader. France is speaking through him. 
  If, tomorrow, French firmness were to foster the conclusion 
of a real cease-fire and the acceleration of the Geneva 
negotiations, Matignon and the Elysee's voice surely would be 
heard. Nevertheless, Juppe would still derive a legitimate 
benefit. Thus the foreign affairs minister is playing an 
important personal game. If the policy France advocates leads to 
a happy solution in the former Yugoslavia, Juppe will be the man 
who unblocked the situation. He will have proved that the 
statesmanlike qualities attributed to him are indeed real. He 
will also be able to claim new responsibilities in the future, 
beginning with the leadership of the single list of the majority 
for the European Parliament elections. The Bosnian issue, which 
has been poisoning French political life for months, will then 
have served to restore reasonableness to the majority.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "New Confrontation"] </F>
  [Text] The apparent calm in Moscow is still merely 
ephemeral. The calm which had reigned in Russia since the 
December elections was shattered on Wednesday 23 February on the 
eve of Boris Yeltsin's address to the Federal Assembly on his 
reform program. Although he can pride himself on the "success" 
of his diplomacy in Bosnia, in Moscow he is being forced into a 
confrontation with Parliament, whose lower house -- the Duma -- 
has voted for an amnesty for last October's "putschists" and for 
the August 1991 "putschists." 
  This is a decision which benefits dozens of his enemies, 
whether in prison or out of prison, and principally Aleksandr 
Rutskoy, the former vice president who enjoys a popularity 
capable of giving the opposition the figurehead it has lacked 
since Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has been discredited by his 
extremism. 
  The issue is therefore an important one, and the tone taken 
by some people close to Boris Yeltsin in condemning this vote is 
reminiscent of that used on the eve of the October clashes. 
There is once again talk of a "threat of civil war" and they 
are warning that the deputies "will have to take all the 
consequences" of their action.... 
  The former Communists and nationalists, of whom there are 
even more in the Duma than in the former Parliament, at the 
instigation of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's party, very quickly found the 
flaw in the new Constitution, despite the fact that it strips 
them of virtually all power to the benefit of the president or 
the prime minister. Although the laws adopted by the Duma can so 
easily be blocked, the Constitution does not stipulate any limit 
on its right to grant an amnesty. 
  And yet on Thursday, the president's spokesman warned that 
there is no question of Boris Yeltsin allowing Aleksandr Rutskoy 
and the other putschists to leave prison "for weeks or months." 
He said a new war over interpretations of laws has begun but 
that the opposition's aims go further. Gennadiy Zyuganov, head 
of the Communist group in Parliament, has already called for the 
resignation of Boris Yeltsin and what remains of the reformers 
in the government as a "compromise" measure.... 
  Boris Yeltsin will therefore have to ignore the Constitution 
with which he has provided himself and which, as he again 
stressed on Thursday, is the cornerstone of the country's 
stability. The West will be all the more tempted to continue to 
disregard the undemocratic lapses of the "reform president" in 
Russia even though it is true that these reforms are now taking 
an entirely different course, overtaken by the explosion of 
illegal practices, racketeering, and the exodus of capital.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Marcovici: "Diplomatic Initiatives"] </F>
  [Text] The beginning of a Serb withdrawal around Sarajevo 
reassures the NATO countries--notably those with ground troops 
in Bosnia--who thus see the prospect of air strikes recede. Of 
course, this withdrawal remains to be confirmed and the alliance 
continues to display the same determination. If guns were still 
to threaten Sarajevo, planes would fly at the expiration of the 
ultimatum. Nonetheless, everyone hopes that things will not go 
that far. 
  This is why Russia's pressure on the Serb forces was greeted 
unanimously like a victory of Russian diplomacy. However, this 
is going a little too fast. 
  Since the NATO ultimatum, the Russians have done everything 
in their power to avoid a strike on their Serb friends. They 
have threatened, going as far as brandishing the specter of a 
world conflict; they have used dilatory maneuvers in an attempt 
to disempower NATO to the benefit of the UN; they have 
negotiated by multiplying contacts with Western embassies. These 
efforts were all in vain and did not shake the West's resolve. 
The Russians had but one avenue left: convince the Serbs to 
adhere to the conditions of the ultimatum. This is what Moscow 
did, and this is where the success of its diplomacy stops. It 
must be admitted that it is modest. 
  On the other hand, the policy conducted by the French 
Government scores some points. Paris has been repeating for 
months that to achieve a negotiated settlement of the Bosnian 
issue, it is imperative to have the cooperation of the United 
States and Russia. However, these countries to date had refused 
to do so. Washington did not want to pressure the Muslims, just 
like Moscow refused to pressure the Serbs. The French 
determination following the Sarajevo massacre compelled the 
Americans to join forces with France in NATO and to reconsider 
their relations with the Muslims. Thus created, the 
Franco-American front led Russia to participate in the 
diplomatic process and pressure the Serbs. 
  If this new element, derived from the French initiative, 
produces results and renders useless NATO air strikes now that 
the stranglehold on Sarajevo has loosened, France will have won 
an important diplomatic success. On condition, however, that 
taking advantage of the opportunity, Muslims do not decide to 
fill the void left by the Serbs and raise too high the stakes in 
the peace negotiations that could start as early as next week.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Air Algerie Boeing 727 
landed at l'Altet airport at 1345 [1245 GMT]. It was on an 
internal flight between Oran and Annaba when it was hijacked and 
diverted to l'Altet airport, where it is still being held on the 
runway. The airport has been cordoned off by the police and the 
operation is being headed by Alfonso Calve, civil governor of 
Alicante, who has gone to where the plane is to make contact 
with the three hijackers, who are apparently asking for 
political asylum.

themselves up to the Spanish police. [passage omitted] Concha 
Flores reports: 
  [Flores] A few minutes ago, the spokesman for the Alicante 
Civil Government, Mariano Soriano, told us that at 1805 the 
three hijackers of this Air Algerie plane gave themselves up to 
the Spanish security forces who had cordoned off the plane. 
  It seems that negotiations that were taking place from the 
runway were effective and as we said the news has been 
officially confirmed by the civil government that the three 
hijackers have given themselves up. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The hijacking of the Algerian plane ended after 
1800. The three hijackers gave themselves up to the Spanish 
authorities. After their fright the more than 100 passengers 
are resting, while they wait for the plane to resume its journey 
to Algeria. [passage omitted] Concha Flores reports: 
  [Flores] The three hijackers have given themselves up to the 
Spanish police but they cannot request political asylum because 
they are the perpetrators of a crime of air piracy. Therefore 
they are prohibited from being granted political asylum. They 
are three members of the Algerian police force who decided today 
to leave their country and come to Spain. For this reason they 
hijacked the Boeing 727 as it was on an internal flight from 
Oran to Annaba. The three hijackers are at the moment making 
statements to the Spanish police and after these statements have 
been made, the necessary measures will be taken. However, the 
right to request political asylum is ruled out, as the Alicante 
Civil Governor, Alfonso Calve, said: 
  [Begin Calve recording] What I said was that international 
laws and agreements exclude any possibility of political asylum. 
What is going to happen, as I said, is that following police 
investigations, they will be referred to the courts and it will 
be the judge, and the National High Court, should the judge 
decide that this case be referred to the High Court, who decides 
the future. [end recording] 
  [Flores] [passage omitted] Further conclusions made public 
by the Civil Government reveal that they have no connection with 
Islamic fundamentalist movements. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Christian Brondum report: "Criticism of Spain's EU </F>
Demands"] 
  [Text] Denmark is exerting maximum pressure to make it 
possible to reach agreement with Sweden, Norway, Finland, and 
Austria on the terms for accession to the EU [European Union]. 
  This happened at the EU Commission's annual EU conference at 
Vilvorde Course Center near Copenhagen. 
  Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic 
Party) 
and EU Commissioner Henning Christophersen both stressed Spain's 
demand for fishing rights off Norway as one of the biggest 
problems that must be solved in the current round of marathon 
negotiations before the EU's deadline for the negotiations runs 
out on Tuesday [1 March]. 
  Henning Christophersen warned that if the EU does not 
succeed 
in reaching agreement with the four applicants countries, this 
will have "far-reaching consequences" for the future of Europe 
and for the chances of bringing in Europe's closest neighbors to 
the east. And the prime minister was sharply critical of Spain's 
demand for Norwegian fish: 
  "I believe that Spanish interests will not in the final 
analysis block a solution. I quite simply consider Spain's 
demand for fishing rights up there in the north to be impossible 
to achieve. It is possible that Spain itself knows this. I 
believe that they will realize this at a certain point," Nyrup 
Rasmussen said. 
  Nyrup Rasmussen thinks that the problems surrounding support 
for the three Nordic countries' agricultural production are 
minor problems. Their agricultural production amounts to only 1 
to 2 percent of the EU's total agricultural production. And 
with a little imagination and dynamism there could also be a 
solution to the Nordic countries' regional problems in the 
northern regions. 
  "There will be a great deal of drama in the final straight. 
But I do not think that this drama will be the final word. 
  "The Danish Government will put all its efforts into 
achieving a reasonable result. 
  "If things go as I hope, not long after the end of the 
century the EU will embrace 20 or more states," Nyrup Rasmussen 
added.

<F P=106> [Christian Brondum report: "Nyrup Rasmussen Rejects New </F>
Treaty for the Community"] 
  [Text] Not until the spring of 1995 will the Danish 
Government begin to analyze what changes Denmark will propose 
when the EU [European Union] countries meet for an 
intergovernmental conference on the EU's future in 1996. And in 
advance Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is rejecting the 
possibility that the result in 1996 could be a new treaty. 
  So said the prime minister yesterday at a conference 
arranged 
by the European Commission. 
  "I seen one major problem that I would like to mention 
immediately. The time is not right to build new European 
castles in the air when it comes to relinquishing sovereignty. 
We must remember that the Maastricht treaty came into force on 
1 November last year. We have scarcely become acquainted with 
the tools it contains as yet. There can be no point in our 
making changes six months later in our eagerness to achieve 
perfection. And, after all, the signal from the people of 
Europe is not great love of European institutions. People have 
to be able to come along with us," Nyrup Rasmussen said. 
  He stressed that European cooperation will continue to be 
cooperation among nation-states and that the many words spoken 
must be seen in actions that the peoples of Europe can see in 
everyday life. 
  In his speech to a number of invited politicians, business 
leaders, and civil servants, the prime minister outlined his 
vision of developments in the next 10-20 years. The United 
States will be alone in the role of superpower. Neither Russia, 
Japan, China, or Europe will be able to develop into great 
powers in this period. Europe probably can develop into an 
economic superpower, but not a military superpower. 
  Nyrup predicted major problems in maintaining viable 
cooperation among the EU countries once they have become 20 or 
more after the end of the century. 
  "The task is impossible. But it will be done," he said. 
  In his address EU Commissioner Henning Christophersen 
predicted that it will now be almost impossible to set up the 
third phase of economic and monetary union -- the common 
currency -- in 1996 as planned. A number of countries are 
striving to achieve this goal, but in particular the large 
public sector deficits in many countries will prevent a 
sufficient number of countries being able to meet the criteria 
for creating monetary union. 
  It is therefore more realistic that EMU -- economic and 
monetary union -- will not come until 1999.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Erling Olsen by Konrad </F>
Jensen and Jens Peter Skaarup; place and date not given: "They 
Must Be Allowed To Work in Peace If They Are To Protect 
Democracy Against the `Intolerant'"] 
  [Text] Justice Minister Erling Olsen is the head of the 
secret police. As head of the Police Intelligence Service, PET, 
the country's justice minister holds a powerful tool in his 
hands. The secret police have the right to watch, monitor, and 
register the citizen's slightest movements to a degree unmatched 
by any other state institution. The parameters for the 
service's work are described in a highly confidential set of 
rules dating from 1953 and now ripe for retirement, but it is 
the minister who decides on the details of which political 
groups the service is to spend its time on. 
  [POLITIKEN] It is said that a minister for justice can 
easily 
misuse the Police Intelligence Service if he is determined to do 
so. For example, he can use the PET to spy on his or the 
government's political opponents. Is this true? 
  [Olsen] I have never attempted to do so, nor would I ever 
dream of doing so. If one wants to do away with one's 
opponents, then there are far better ways of going about it. Is 
it possible? I do not think the present head of the PET would 
allow it. Nor do I think that the heads of department in the 
Justice Ministry or the commissioner of police would allow it. 
If I insisted on trying to persuade them, then the right thing 
for them to do would be to go to the Prime Minister and report 
me. 
  [POLITIKEN] What do you use the PET for? 
  [Olsen] I use the PET to ensure that democracy is not so 
tolerant that it lets power slip into the hands of the 
intolerant. It is the PET's job to watch external and internal 
enemies. It is the latter who are the most interesting, 
following the shift in the international situation. 
  [POLITIKEN] Of what benefit is the PET to the public? 
  [Olsen] The benefit is that democracy is protected. There is 
a borderline between tolerance and naivete that must not be 
crossed. There are at the moment right-wing groups that were 
left-wing groups, as we saw in Norrebro after the EC vote on 18 
May last year. We have to monitor these extreme groups. They 
have the right to express themselves as they wish, but the 
moment more militant action takes place, we have to keep an eye 
on them. In order to ensure that things remain reasonably 
peaceful, we have to nip this type of action in the bud. 
<H5>  Monitoring the PET </H5>
  [POLITIKEN] As justice minister you have ultimate 
responsibility for the PET. You are, in fact, the only one 
outside the service who has access to details of the PET's work. 
What do you do in order to ensure that you know enough about 
the activities of the PET? What do you do to keep control of 
the PET? 
  [Olsen] You cannot have a service like this without there 
being a considerable degree of self-control, that is, 
self-control by the employees. I cannot run around checking on 
the PET. I receive 200 letters a day, I give interviews to the 
press, I attend meetings and so forth. I have a great many 
things to do. 
  [POLITIKEN] Which is tantamount to saying that the 
monitoring 
of the PET is, to a great extent, carried out by the PET itself? 
  [Olsen] Yes, that is true. The same thing applies everywhere 
in the public administration. As a minister, you cannot keep an 
eye on everything. But if anything happens that should not 
happen, then you have to go into it and do something about it. 
  [POLITIKEN] But that implies that you hear about it. 
  [Olsen] And that is why we have a fairly free press. 
  [POLITIKEN] So it is up to the press to check on the PET? 
  [Olsen] It is up to the press and the employees within the 
PET. Obviously the PET could not live with a reputation like the 
KGB's. There must be support for and confidence in the methods 
used by the PET, and if an employee oversteps the rules, that is 
grounds for dismissal. 
  [POLITIKEN] Is the self-control so careful that you dare 
place your head on the block and say that the intelligence 
service has no chance of taking you for a ride? 
  [Olsen] I shall never be happy at the thought of laying my 
head on any block. Not even a journalist's. 
<H5>  The Threat Comes From the Forces of the Right </H5>
  [POLITIKEN] How can the PET work according to a set of rules 
that is 41 years old and that came into being when the Cold War 
was at its coldest. The world and the threat assessment picture 
have changed a good deal since then, after all. 
  [Olsen] That is why we are also considering changing the 
rules, so that we spend more time watching internal enemies than 
we do external ones. 
  [POLITIKEN] Where do the threats against the Danish state 
come from today? 
  [Olsen] You have organized forces of the extreme right, you 
see nazism spreading outside our borders. At the moment we are 
experiencing pressure from Germany, which regards us as being so 
open and democratic that we may become a haven for German Nazi 
and right-wing forces. They can direct operations from here. 
We see, too, that a number of Danish Nazis have quite good 
links with the German forces of the right. Those are things we 
have to keep an eye on. 
  [POLITIKEN] Would it be fair to say that, whereas 20 to 30 
years ago it was the left wing that was fanatical, it is now the 
right wing? 
  [Olsen] I have to admit that at the moment I am more afraid 
of the right wing than I am of the left. 
<H5>  Necessary Secrets </H5>
  [POLITIKEN] Why does the PET's operating mandate have to 
remain a secret? 
  [Olsen] The people who come under the scrutiny of the PET 
must not be aware of it. 
  [POLITIKEN] When the mandate is secret, the inevitable 
impression is that it authorizes the PET to do things that are 
just inside or even in breach of the rules and laws that 
otherwise apply to police work. 
  [Olsen] That is not the way it is. It is simply a question 
of those people whom the PET "looks after" not needing to know 
too much. 
  [POLITIKEN] Is there actually anything in the operating 
mandate stating what people and which groups the PET is to 
monitor? 
  [Olsen] So far as I remember there is nothing about that. 
But apart from that I cannot say what is written in the 
mandate. If I could, there would be no reason to keep it secret. 
  [POLITIKEN] When a 41-year-old operating mandate has been in 
use for so many years, it must be worded very generally. So it 
must be up to the justice minister at any given time to flesh 
out the bones -- to direct the PET's current work. How have you 
altered the course of the PET? 
  [Olsen] It is true that the minister can flesh out the bones 
with some general measures. But he is obliged to leave a good 
deal to the experts in policing matters. My message to the PET 
at the beginning of my career as justice minister was about the 
intelligence service needing to pay more attention to the 
enemies from within. 
  [POLITIKEN] Does it make any difference to the PET whether 
there is a conservative or a social democratic justice minister? 
  [Olsen] I do not honestly think so. 
  [POLITIKEN] Is that because the PET is first and foremost an 
operation run by civil servants? 
  [Olsen] No, it is because it is a question of defending 
democracy, and the conservatives want to do that just as much as 
we do. 
  [POLITIKEN] In common with the parliamentary control 
committee and the PET chief Birgitte Stampe, you are in favor of 
greater openness concerning the PET. What does "greater 
openness" mean? 
  [Olsen] It does not mean revealing secrets, but clearing up 
misunderstandings. I think, for example, that we can certainly 
talk about the current threat assessment picture. I think we 
can also certainly talk about the budget for the PET. Why keep 
it a secret, when the number of employees can be seen in the 
Annual Police Report? In other words: considerably more 
openness than we have today. 
  [POLITIKEN] Do you think the PET deserves to be taken 
seriously by the public so long as everything to do with the 
service is kept secret? 
  [Olsen] I believe that the public likes the secrecy. While 
we are faced with these revolutionary groups, these people who 
refuse to acknowledge democratic rules of play, then we need to 
keep an eye on them. Confronted by highly organized crime, we 
need to do something about it. Often it takes place unobserved. 
But clearly it must happen according to proper rules of play. 
As far as the PET is concerned, we have to leave things to it, 
but at the end of the day I am the one who decides what is to be 
done and what may be made public. 
<H5>  PET Given a Long Lead </H5>
  [POLITIKEN] One of the most serious attacks against state 
security -- against democracy -- took place after the EC 
referendum 18 May last year. On that occasion the Copenhagen 
police were caught unawares, because the PET had not foreseen 
the riots in Norrebro. Why have you not asked for an 
investigation into the role of the PET in this case, in the same 
way as the role of the Copenhagen Police Force is being 
investigated by the attorney general? 
  [Olsen] Yes, but the Attorney General's investigation also 
includes the work of the PET. I have also wondered myself why 
it was that the PET was unable to foresee that catastrophic 
situation which developed during the evening and night. The PET 
ought to know about this sort of thing beforehand. On the other 
hand, the PET cannot have a spy on every corner. We would be a 
police state. So there will conceivably be some things that the 
PET does not know. I am afraid that if we have too much 
surveillance, we will also see an escalation. You have to 
restrict yourself when it comes to things like telephone 
bugging. Denmark must not become a society of eavesdroppers. 
But it goes without saying that the PET made a mistake in not 
foreseeing the disturbances in Norrebro. It is now the job of 
the attorney general to assess how serious a mistake it was. 
When we have heard from him, then it will be up to me as 
justice minister to consider whether changes are necessary in 
the PET's working methods. 
  [POLITIKEN] How can the PET be justified in having up to 
12,000 people registered on suspicion of antistate activity when 
virtually nobody is ever accused and brought to trial? 
  [Olsen] Well, if they were all to be accused and tried, then 
something would be wrong. In surveillance terms, you always 
have to monitor far more people than you can bring charges 
against. 
  [POLITIKEN] Your own control body -- the Wamberg Committee 
with Chief Administrative Officer Bodil Panild, Senior Archivist 
Hans Christian Bjerg, Solicitor Niels Fisch-Thomsen, and 
Publisher Kurt Fromberg -- has to approve all registrations of 
Danish citizens. But what about the 200,000 or so foreign 
nationals permanently resident in Denmark? Is there nobody to 
check any registrations made of them? 
  [Olsen] I have not thought about that question, and so I 
cannot answer it. 
  [POLITIKEN] Where is the line drawn for how much 
run-of-the-mill crime the PET can allow itself to close its eyes 
to in the attempt to uncover something bigger and more serious 
-- for example, a Dane collaborating with the intelligence 
service of an Eastern country or a terrorist organization in the 
Middle East? 
  [Olsen] That rests entirely on police assessment. But it is 
my view that the PET should have a fairly long leash. 
  [POLITIKEN] In spite of what you have said in this 
interview, 
as an ordinary person one gets the impression that nobody -- not 
even the changing justice ministers -- ever call the PET to 
account for what the intelligence service does. Is it right 
that, in a democratic society, the PET should have such free 
rein? 
  [Olsen] The fact is that it is not the justice minister who 
calls the PET to order. If anything goes wrong in the PET, it 
is the justice minister's responsibility. That is the way it is.

<F P=106> [Ib Konrad Jensen and Jens Peter Skaarup report: "Police </F>
Intelligence Service Must Adapt to Age of Mafia and Neo-Nazis, 
Says Justice Minister"] 
  [Text] Justice Minister Erling Olsen (SDP [Social 
Democratic Party]) wants to modernize the rules of play for the 
Police Intelligence Service, PET. The current rules were 
written in 1953, at the beginning of the Cold War period, and 
Erling Olsen thinks that it is time to put an end to the secret 
police's outdated picture of the enemy. 
  Watching traditional enemies such as spies from East Europe 
is to be scaled down, while increased efforts are to be made 
against the new enemies. The new enemies are the international 
crime syndicates, the neo-Nazis, other extreme right-wing 
forces, the former BZ's -- the so-called autonomous groups -- 
[radical squatters and activists operating in inner Copenhagen] 
and the rocker groups. 
  In an interview with SONDAGS POLITIKEN, Erling Olsen 
justifies his views by referring to the political changes that 
have taken place in Europe during the last five or six years. 
The Cold War is over, and the old antagonisms between East and 
West no longer exist. 
  "What has happened is that we now have fewer external 
enemies 
and more internal ones," he said. 
  The justice minister is of the opinion that the Russian 
mafia, the Italian Mafia, the Chinese triads and the South 
American drug syndicates represent a real threat to Denmark. He 
categorizes them as "internal enemies" because they set up 
branches here in Denmark and function as a sort of crime 
importation business. One example of their activity is the 
dozens of villa break-ins reported by the police north of 
Copenhagen each week. 
  At the same time, Germany is exerting pressure on Denmark to 
get the Danish authorities to take a firmer stand against the 
extreme right-wing movements in Denmark. The Germans, among 
other things, resent the fact that sales of German nazi 
literature have taken place from a box number in Randers, and 
that the German Thies Christophersen is able to distribute nazi 
propaganda from his home in Kollund. 
  "Germany is pressurizing us at the moment; they see us as so 
open and democratic that we may become a haven for German nazi 
forces and right-wing forces. They are able to conduct their 
business from here. We can also see that a number of the Danish 
nazis have fairly good links with the German right-wing forces. 
This is something we must keep an eye on," Erling Olsen said. 
  The present government regulations were formulated by the 
then Justice Minister Hans Haekkerup and are confidential. The 
new ones will also be confidential, but will only be written 
after consultation with the five-member committee in the 
Folketing, set up in 1988 to keep an eye on both the Police 
Intelligence Service and the Defense Intelligence Service. 
  "Writing the rules is my responsibility, but it is always 
wise to listen to others," Erling Olsen said.

  [Text] President Mauno Koivisto thinks that at the time of 
changing presidents, Finland is not in such a period of 
transition where a change of guard will cause problems. 
Koivisto did not think that he had left unfinished any projects 
that would have strongly depended on him. The only matter that 
had intensified at the time of the transfer of power was the 
negotiations for European Union membership. President Koivisto 
thought now, before the decisive talks, that they had proceeded 
a long way and the number of open issues have been reduced. In 
his opinion, it looks very much as if Finland has the least 
number of open issues after Sweden. It is possible that a 
solution will be found. 
  In a farewell interview granted for the Finnish News Agency 
at Maentyniemi [new presidential residence in Helsinki], 
Koivisto thought that new President Martti Ahtisaari will handle 
matters in the traditional matter. The president will devote 
himself to international issues.

<F P=106> [Article by Emily von Sydow: "EU's Offer Angered Haavisto, </F>
Salolainen"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto used 
harsh words in Brussels at Monday's [7 February] negotiating 
round: The EU [European Union] has dawdled over submitting its 
positions on agriculture and regional issues, and once they 
finally come they are a major disappointment. 
  EU's foreign ministers finally agreed on a joint position on 
the candidate nations in the following areas: Agriculture and 
regional policy. It is nothing but a framework program, which 
does not contain any details. The map must be drawn during the 
next few weeks. The position expresses understanding in 
principle for the special problems that prevail in the Nordic 
regions, it recognizes the need for treating the northern 
farmers in a way similar to their colleagues in the EU, and it 
envisions the need for long-range, decreasing national support 
for the farmers who are affected by the price cuts. 
  "Public opinion in Finland is still very positive to 
membership, but it is not known how it will be affected by the 
most recent offer," the minister said threateningly. 
<H5>  The Farmers Need 12 Billion </H5>
  The EU's demand for immediate price adjustment is a 
catastrophe for Finnish agriculture, says the former chairman of 
MTK [Agricultural Producers' Association]. Since Finnish 
agricultural prices are twice as high as in the EU, it would 
result in a budget expenditure of 12 billion markkas to 
compensate the farmers for their losses, Haavisto explained. 
  "It also would not benefit the consumers, who would only to 
a 
limited extent get lower prices on food. The food prices are 
simply dependent on the value-added tax [VAT] system," Haavisto 
further said. 
  The EU's position that the farmers in southern Finland 
should 
only get one-third of the subsidy was also something completely 
unacceptable: 
  "We reminded them that we are net contributors to the EU," 
Haavisto said. 
<H5>  Three Weeks' Time </H5>
  On the part of the EU commission one has said that in the 
final round everything will be dealt with as a single package: 
Budget, structural funds, and agricultural subsidies, but that 
is not acceptable to Finland, which says that the agricultural 
questions are too essential and must be solved separately. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen states that EU's 
negotiators must now get clear directives to reduce the gap 
between the negotiating positions. 
  "We have three weeks to do it. We can manage it if the 
political will is there. It is not enough to have technical 
will," he said. 
  The EU was given Finland's positions on structural and 
regional policy in June and on agricultural policy in September. 
Not until now, however, did one sit down and negotiate on a 
political level. Haavisto and Salolainen repeatedly brought up 
this discrepancy in time. 
<H5>  We Are Only Demanding the Same Conditions </H5>
  "We are demanding nothing more than that the EU's rules are 
applied in a correct manner in Finland. We only demand that our 
farmers should be treated the same way as EU farmers." 
  Finland also explained in its seven-page-long speech at the 
negotiating table that Finland will follow the common 
agricultural policy to the full extent once the country is a 
member of the EU, that is to say reduce production and area. 
  The Finnish Government's frequent trips around the capitals 
of Europe in order to explain the difficult situation in the 
sparsely populated Nordic provinces and of the farmers seem to 
have fallen on deaf ears, judging by the EU's not very 
sympathetic attitude toward the Nordic regions, said one 
journalist: 
  "Not until three weeks from now (when the deadline for the 
negotiations expires) will we see whether the trips have been 
successful," replied Pertti Salolainen. 
  The Norwegians were more positive than Finland's negotiators 
to the same offer. The Norwegian delegation stated that it has 
received an "opening toward transitional periods" for price 
reductions. 
  The Swedish negotiators also thought the day had been 
useful, 
although no results had been achieved in substance. 
  Sweden is pushing very hard for Objective 1 status, that is 
to say the one given to the very poorest regions in the EU, for 
its northernmost regions (Norrbotten). Finland as well is 
pushing hard to have its regions recognized as Objective 1. The 
major difference between Objective 1 and Objective 2, and 5b, 
respectively, is that within the framework for Objective 1 it is 
possible to provide money for the infrastructure. Further, the 
Objective 1 funds permit the EU to contribute 75 percent of the 
investments. Objective 1 funds represent three-fourths of the 
funding in the total structural fund.

  [Excerpts] The European Union [EU] has come somewhat closer 
to Finland's demands concerning farming. Foreign Trade Minister 
Pertti Salolainen in Brussels ponders in the following remarks 
whether a negotiation result will be achieved on the basis of 
the new offer during the night: 
  [Begin Salolainen recording] Well, that depends entirely on 
whether we will get our central views accepted. As has been 
noted, this document is not acceptable to us as it is; there 
must be considerable improvements made to it. We are currently 
deliberating them among ourselves and preparing our own 
counterproposals. That will indicate whether a solution can be 
found. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto is, however, still 
dissatisfied. 
  [Begin Haavisto recording] There are numerous points. Of 
course, the two most central ones are that we must get the 
subsidy arrangement to extend to all of Finland and, secondly, 
that the arrangements for the transition period must be such 
that they do not cause unreasonable problems for any sector in 
Finland. [end recording] 
  The Finnish Government will meet in an hour to study the 
situation in the EU negotiations, i.e., a couple of hours before 
the original deadline. Prime Minister Esko Aho thinks that 
there is, if necessary, a margin of flexibility in the timetable.

  [Text] Tension is rising in the ongoing EU [European Union] 
membership talks in Brussels as only a few hours remain until 
the deadline of the talks, i.e., 2400. Foreign Trade Minister 
Pertti Salolainen and Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, 
Finland's negotiators, are to sit at the negotiation table with 
ministers from the European Union. The Finns will officially 
receive the EU's new offer on agricultural subsidies and 
regional policies. The ministers did not wish to make much 
comment on the offer before the negotiations. According to 
them, it is a starting paper for negotiations. 
  Early this evening, the EU ministers completed a new offer 
to 
Finland. In that offer, agricultural subsidies and regional 
subsidies were gathered together in a package. According to the 
new offer, the EU permits a widening of subsidies to unfavorable 
farming areas in such a way that the subsidies will cover 85 
percent of Finland's arable area. Regional structural subsidies 
are offered particularly to those regions that remain outside 
farming subsidies. In the EU's view, its offer of farming 
subsidies and regional policies creates the basis for a soft 
adaptation of Finnish farming to the Union's farming. 
  The EU offer mentions that in serious situations of 
difficulty, direct national subsidies may be considered. A 
subsidy for a northern region may be offered in the same way as 
the previous subsidy north of the 62d parallel. The EU does, 
however, permit some small additional regions nearby to be 
included within this subsidy. The northern subsidy would be a 
part of the national subsidies. The EU still requires a direct 
transition to the EU's producer prices. 
  The Finnish Government met this afternoon to study the 
situation in the EU negotiations. The government will convene 
anew at 1000, i.e., a few hours before the deadline set for the 
negotiations. According to reports from Brussels, the European 
Union has come somewhat closer to Finland. More information is 
expected in the course of this evening of the European Union's 
latest offers.

  [Text] Now Sweden, and how top secret Soviet information 
was used in the development of the JAS-39 Gripen [multirole 
combat aircraft]. Many of the most advanced Soviet weapons 
systems ended up in the United States during the 1980's. The 
deliveries were made in Poland in great secrecy according to the 
newspaper THE WASHINGTON POST. Information from the Soviet 
Union also went to Sweden and has influenced the development 
work of the JAS-39 Gripen, among other things. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The United States managed to 
obtain during the 1980's a number of items of advanced Soviet 
military equipment like air defense missiles, radar systems, 
communications equipment, torpedoes, attack helicopters, and 
tanks. Even though the most modern Soviet material was not 
available in Poland, the deals were made there. Thousands of 
millions were then paid through the military intelligence 
agency, CIA, to foreign contacts. They for their part made sure 
that the money ended up with politicians and officials who were 
willing to sell Soviet military secrets. The analysis of this 
material gave the United States the possibility of preparing 
effective countermeasures and also an advantage in 
military-technological development over the Soviet Union. 
  The CIA thus had access to excellent contacts in Poland, and 
from the United States, Swedish defense has also received 
information on Soviet war materiel. This information has been 
important in the development work of the JAS-39 Gripen, mainly 
in its radar and countermeasures against attacking missiles. 
  But Sweden has also had its own channels. The visa freedom 
between Sweden and Poland in the 1970's and the later emergence 
of the Solidarity movement created space for contacts that were 
very useful to military intelligence. Poland is not available 
for technical reconnaissance in the same way as the Baltic 
countries, for example, so there has been a need for Polish 
informers who have been able to give information on the Warsaw 
Pact's war preparations. The military mapping, of which the 
Polish sellers of tabulated information are suspected, in Sweden 
has had its counterpart in the other direction, a former 
military intelligence officer says to Ekot [the name of this 
program]. The activities in Poland were led by the [Swedish] 
KSI, the Office for Special Information Gathering at the Defense 
Staff, a most secret operation of the military intelligence 
service. 
  There is also information on the regular exchange of 
intelligence information between Sweden and Poland. According 
to information obtained by Ekot, Bengt Wallroth, the then chief 
of the Military Intelligence Service of the Defense Staff, who 
earlier was also the head of the KSI, made an official visit to 
his Polish colleague at the beginning of the 1980's. Such 
contacts with the East bloc were very unusual and only existed 
with Poland and Yugoslavia. The information from Poland and 
Yugoslavia has been of great value both to Swedish defense 
planning and as a commodity to exchange with other countries' 
military intelligence organizations.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikael Holmstrom: "EU Study Shows Unambiguous </F>
Picture"] 
  [Text] Rejection of the European Union [EU] will lead to 
less international influence for Sweden, a worsened security 
situation, fewer opportunities for action in the Baltic Sea 
region, increased vulnerability in times of unrest, and larger 
defense burdens. Approval will bring almost nothing but 
advantages. 
  That unambiguous picture is presented in the study entitled 
"Historic Choice," which was submitted to Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas on Thursday [28 January]. The study 
is supposed to show the effect on foreign and security policy of 
a decision to join or stay out of the EU. 
  The study's authors are Sverker Astrom and Leif Leifland 
(cabinet secretaries in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 
1972 to 1977 and from 1977 to 1982 respectively). 
  "We have tried to write as objectively as possible," said 
Leifland at the news conference. When questioned about the 
unambiguous picture presented in the report, he answered that 
"being unambiguous does not rule out objectivity." 
<H5>  Fateful Choice Ahead </H5>
  According to the study's authors, Sweden's 5 million 
eligible 
voters are facing a fateful choice. Looming up before the reader 
are two choices: a secure Union offering opportunities or an 
uncertain separateness offering difficulties. 
  The referendum will take place in an international 
environment that has moved quickly from stable security-policy 
tension to "unstable detente." Developments in and around Russia 
are said to be the most important and most difficult-to-assess 
factor affecting Sweden's situation. 
  "Sweden's entry into the EU and its participation in the 
common foreign and security policy represents a historic choice 
that will affect Sweden's position in Europe and the world 
beyond the foreseeable future." 
  At the same time, it is emphasized that this does not mean 
that Sweden will be relinquishing control of its own policies. 
Astrom and Leifland said that the EU's foreign policy rides "the 
same old hobbyhorses" as Sweden, making it both natural and 
urgent to join. Membership in the EU will give Sweden more 
opportunities for directly influencing matters in its immediate 
vicinity, including relations with Russia. 
  "If the Nordic states express their opinion on the Baltic 
states and the Baltic Sea, that will have a powerful effect 
within the EU," Astrom pointed out. 
<H5>  Changed World </H5>
  He and Leifland said that the EU's plans for a future common 
defense policy did not conflict with Sweden's current policy of 
freedom from military alliances. The EU's cooperation on defense 
policy is expected to cover the form and policy of the military 
forces, defense doctrines, intelligence services, 
communications, and equipment. 
  Sweden has spent billions of kronor in several of those 
defense policy areas to produce a "Swedish profile," but now 
international cooperation is consistent with freedom from 
military alliances. 
  "The world around us has changed," Leifland explained. 
  On the other hand, the EU's ambition to establish a future 
common defense force through which the countries will guarantee 
each other's security within the Western European Union (WEU) -- 
and NATO -- is not consistent with today's freedom from 
alliances. But Sweden can join the WEU as an observer. 
  But the Maastricht treaty does not prevent a state from 
remaining free of military alliances (Ireland is an example), 
although Sweden can also decide "freely and independently" at a 
later stage whether it wants to join a common defense force. 
  According to the Maastricht treaty, states shall "actively 
and unconditionally" support the common foreign and security 
policy "in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity." But 
Astrom and Leifland see no problems here in practice. Unanimous 
decisions are required, and if there are to be joint operations, 
the decisionmaking process guarantees the countries a double 
veto. 
<H5>  Less Distinct Profile in United Nations </H5>
  "This means, then, that no member country can be forced 
against its will to participate in a regional operation, 
militarily or otherwise, in a foreign country. Obviously, it is 
also true that no country can be forced to accept foreign troops 
on its territory." 
  If Sweden is a member of the EU, its profile in the United 
Nations will become less distinct. But Denmark's experience was 
said to show that a medium-sized country that joins the EU does 
not lose its old relations but gains a considerably larger 
international hearing. 
  And most important of all: in times of unrest, Sweden can be 
confident that its peacetime cooperation has established a 
network of solidarity within the EU -- a kind of insurance 
premium. This may mean that we will have to take a stand on 
"risky situations," but the advantages outweigh the 
disadvantages: It is a question of uniting states with common 
interests and values. 
  "Even without formal defense obligations, membership in the 
EU will be a net advantage for us -- a plus from the standpoint 
of security policy." 
  On the other hand, rejection of the EU by the Swedish people 
is seen as resulting in existence under the opposite sign: 
  "As an actor on the international stage, Sweden will be less 
interesting and less important. Sweden's marginalization or 
isolation will be almost unavoidable," said Astrom. Outside the 
EU, Sweden will be unable to influence West Europe's decisions 
affecting our own immediate vicinity and will miss out on the 
"security policy plus" represented by membership in the EU. 
  Remaining outside the EU will also make our economy weaker 
-- 
and at the same time we will have to maintain our defense 
capability. The authors of the study discussed the question of 
how Sweden's position outside the EU would be affected if 
Finland joined the EU and the WEU and NATO as well. 
  All other alternatives to the EU (United Nations, CSCE, WEU, 
NATO and its new cooperative organizations, the Council of 
Europe, or Nordic cooperation) either provide no true security 
or are politically impossible. The Riksdag's objective -- a "new 
European security order" -- is nothing more than a dream for the 
future. 
<H5>  Arguing in a Circle </H5>
  Nor is it possible to go back to our all-embracing 
neutrality 
policy, because the world has changed. Astrom, once the foremost 
advocate of the neutrality policy, said that it "has a touch of 
unreality." 
  In what was almost a circular argument, it was noted that 
the 
Riksdag and the government have been committed to EU membership 
since 1991. If the people now say no, the result will be "a 
degree of uncertainty regarding Sweden's position," since other 
solutions have not been considered, and there is no agreement on 
alternatives. 
  Lastly, a no vote will mean losing this historic chance to 
get a reserved seat on the EU train. Meanwhile, the EU's foreign 
and security policy will be further developed without Swedish 
influence. If we change our minds later, the adjustment will be 
harder, because then we will be fighting for space and influence 
with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, 
Latvia, and Lithuania. 
  "It would be a little ironic if Sweden were to join the EU 
under Albania's chairmanship," Astrom joked. 
<H5>  Picture in Black and White </H5>
  This study of the effects that joining or staying out of the 
EU would have on foreign and security policy is one of six such 
studies in preparation for the referendum. 
  The pluses if Sweden joins the EU: 
  1. Greater international influence. 
  2. Benefits from the standpoint of security policy. 
  3. We would retain control over our own foreign policy. 
  4. More opportunities to influence relations with the East. 
  The negatives if Sweden stays out of the EU: 
  1. Reduced international influence. 
  2. Security policy will have to be redefined: Freedom from 
alliances will no longer suffice. 
  3. Less possibility of being active in the Baltic Sea area. 
  4. Increased defense burdens.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Goran Persson, Social Democratic </F>
Party finance policy spokesman, by Sigrid Leijonhufvud in 
Stockholm; date not given: "Persson Sees Light at End of Tunnel"] 
  [Text] The Social Democrats have begun preparations for the 
transfer of power that they are hoping and fighting for in an 
election campaign that for all practical purposes has already 
begun. 
  In an interview that lasted a couple of hours and was 
interrupted by an intriguing minor riot in the ranks, we were 
told by the shadow government's minister of finance, 45-year-old 
Goran Persson, that he was working under high pressure on an 
emergency program for Sweden. There are parallels with the 
emergency program that, under the title "Future for Sweden," was 
worked out by a task force headed by current party Chairman 
Ingvar Carlsson in 1981. It has not been decided whether the new 
program will be made public during the election campaign. 
  But in any case, it will be the basis for a "running start" 
by the Social Democrats if they win the election. 
<H5>  Program Under Discussion </H5>
  The crisis is far from over even though, figuratively 
speaking, Goran Persson can see light at the end of the tunnel. 
  But now a more short-term program with the same title as the 
one in 1981 -- "Future for Sweden" -- is under discussion. It 
has been only a few days since Persson, along with Ingvar 
Carlsson and party secretary Mona Sahlin, presented the Social 
Democratic Party's shadow budget. 
  We asked: "Are you pleased with the reaction?" 
  He answered: "Yes, I am." 
  Persson is such a good shadow minister that not a shadow of 
doubt crossed his face. 
  He said with a satisfied grin: "The criticism we are getting 
from the nonsocialist side is awfully sour. That is partly 
because we have gotten a grip on savings and are showing 
responsibility for state finances and partly because we, too, 
have a program against unemployment." 
  In his budget alternative, Persson came up with a balance 
for 
fiscal 1994-95 that is just over 5 billion kronor better than 
the government's proposal even though spending increases total 
22 billion kronor. The equation was solved largely by the 
assumption that 90,000 new jobs will produce more tax revenues 
and reduce expenditures by 15.8 billion kronor. 
  "Is that voodoo economics?" 
  "No," he answered. "I don't let that criticism bother me. 
There is a very strong connection between higher unemployment 
and a deterioration in state finances. If the connection is so 
obvious in that direction, then the same thing applies in the 
other direction." 
  Persson also remarked that there has been hardly any 
criticism of his proposals regarding taxes on capital and 
stockholders. 
  According to the party's tax bill, reintroducing double 
taxation -- Persson does not like the expression -- will mean 
3.9 billion kronor in higher taxes from the households concerned 
and 1.6 billion from firms in fiscal 1994-95 alone. 
  He said: "We have noticed the silence on that subject. 
Naturally, we are going to step up our criticism of the 
government regarding taxes on capital, an area where we see that 
we are in a very strong position." 
  The government's tax reductions, combined with unemployment, 
are going to be the Social Democratic Party's big issue in the 
election campaign. Persson makes no secret of that fact. 
  We asked: "What about internal criticism?" 
  He answered: "I have tried to use the kind of language that 
Social Democrats will recognize. It consists of combining an 
austere message with arguments regarding an income distribution 
policy while always emphasizing the fight against unemployment. 
It has been very well received." 
<H5>  "People's Home" Preferred Over "Welfare State" </H5>
  With that in mind, Persson has very deliberately used the 
expression "people's home," which he feels is better than the 
"somewhat bloated" expression "welfare state." 
  We asked: "What about the proposal to reduce the parents' 
insurance benefit?" (The same card that the government was going 
to play the next day.) 
  He answered: "Things have gone very well there, too. It is 
not popular, but on the other hand...." 
  "Does this increase confidence in your policy?" 
  "Yes. It is a matter, you know, of showing that we must 
effect savings, and if we do so, people are going to feel it. 
But when we make these proposals, which are touchy ones, we also 
include the line of reasoning about taxing stockholders. The two 
issues go together." 
  We asked: "Does this mean that there is no criticism worth 
taking seriously?" 
  He answered: "I want to be clear and say that it is going to 
be very hard and difficult work reducing unemployment. On that 
subject we probably need more open discussion of the problems. 
But it is a subject on which we have not gotten much reaction 
yet." 
  "Do you mean that the line of reasoning is not fully 
developed in your bill?" 
  "Yes, it is a bigger job than many people think -- except 
for 
the unemployed, of course, who naturally understand the whole 
thing in their own way. In other words, I would like to see more 
problemizing on the whole subject. I miss that contribution to 
the debate." 
  We asked: "But how will it be possible, using measures 
adopted by the Riksdag at its spring session, to make a big 
impact on employment and the national budget so quickly?" 
  He answered: "We cannot swear to the last billion kronor or 
the last 10,000 jobs or the phasing-in of the program in one 
fiscal year. But it is still an accurate way of describing the 
process." 
  We said: "In his guest editorial in DAGENS NYHETER, Carl 
Bildt criticized you on a number of points." 
  Persson replied: "I haven't actually read it." 
  But he explained the absence from the Social Democratic bill 
of a section on the EU [European Union] by saying that his party 
does not disagree with the government when it comes to the 
importance of joining the EU. 
  We asked: "So what happened to your talk about the spiral of 
depression in earlier bills?" 
  He replied: "It was an obvious danger as recently as last 
fall, when the economic fraternity was split on that point. The 
question was whether Finland's path would become our path. If 
so, should we say that we did not believe it would? No, it is 
better to be cautious. Fortunately, private consumption had 
bottomed out at the time. The spiral did not continue downward, 
but we still have a dual economy, with one part growing like mad 
while the other is declining." 
  We asked: "Is the fact that private consumption is rising 
slightly the reason why you are not again proposing a drop in 
VAT [value-added tax]?" 
  Persson answered: "Yes, but there are also technical 
reasons. 
Reducing VAT for seven months is not meaningful, and we said 
right from the start that the lower rates should not continue 
past the end of 1994." 
<H5>  Questioned About Deletion </H5>
  At that point the interview was interrupted: Social 
Democratic members of the Riksdag's Communications Committee 
wanted to know why they had not been consulted before Persson, 
in completing the bill, deleted 1.7 billion kronor in planned 
highway spending from the package for the coming fiscal year. 
  After the interruption, he explained: "That was the last 
thing I did Sunday [24 January] night." 
  In his criticism, Bildt pointed out that the Social 
Democrats 
were including 1.5 billion kronor in the budget as the proceeds 
from selling off the venture capital firms Atle and Bure, but 
had left out the several billion kronor that would not be 
collected because they wanted to halt the privatization of 
Assidoman. 
  Persson said generously: "I can accept that criticism if 
Bildt will promise not to sell off Assidoman." But he agrees 
that what is involved is naturally not savings but an injection 
of cash into the budget. 
  "But notice that we are also including one-time effects in 
the other direction, and they are much bigger than this one," he 
says, drawing attention to, among other things, the proposal on 
direct write-offs, which is expected to cost the Treasury 5 
billion kronor during fiscal 1994-95. 
  Work on the shadow budget began in November after the 
government presented its autumn bill. Based on the opinions of 
10 or so forecasting institutes and his own economic staff in 
the Riksdag Building, Persson attempted to evaluate the 
situation as it would look in January. 
  About 20 November, he presented his analysis to about 10 
Social Democratic economists from universities, banks, and union 
organizations. 
  Social Democrats from the Riksdag's Finance Committee also 
attended. 
  Persson told them: "Early in December, I will approach the 
main Riksdag group and give them my opinion. I will say it means 
that the budget work ahead of us is going to be very troublesome 
but that our focus should be on investment. But I also want room 
for reform -- something that will provide encouragement. So I 
put in an extra 50 million kronor for culture and another 100 
million kronor for adult education. But the whole thing must 
result in a budget proposal in which the balance will not be 
worse than that in the government's proposal." 
  To remind the committee members that it was necessary to 
effect savings, Persson wrote them a letter in the middle of 
December. We asked: "What did it say?" 
  He replied: "During the Christmas break, you must come up 
with a bunch of savings that we can decide on when we return in 
January." 
  We asked: "Did they come up with savings or revenue 
enhancements?" 
  He answered: "Both. We call it savings, but they often 
involve tax increases." 
  Just before Christmas, Persson met with economists from the 
TCO [Central Organization of Salaried Employees], who were 
shocked by his prediction that the government would forecast a 
2.4-percent growth rate for 1994. (Persson is more than a little 
proud that his prediction, made in November, was right on the 
mark.) The TCO was expecting a growth rate of 1 percent this 
year. 
  Then the government's budget was presented on 10 January. 
  "But what surprised me when I read the budget was that the 
government had not been able to come up with a savings package. 
That was a weak spot. I had been thinking that they would be 
able to save something." 
<H5>  Few Billion Kronor in Savings Proposal </H5>
  Aside from the tax increases already adopted at the fall 
session of the Riksdag, the government had only a few billion 
kronor in its savings proposal for 1994-95. The savings 
concerned dental care and medicines plus what Persson calls Ian 
Wachtmeister savings on the allowance for families with more 
than one child, the press subsidy, and the subsidy for home 
language instruction. 
  "Those last items were nothing more than political 
provocations." 
  The message to the committees, however, was that they should 
accept anything in the way of savings that the government had 
proposed. What came next was a real tussle over the budget -- a 
foretaste of what may be in store. Except when priority areas 
were involved, Persson sat in his office and, with Ingvar 
Carlsson's consent, knocked down every bright spending proposal 
by the committee members. 
  "They sat there, one by one, in the same chair you are 
sitting in," he told me with a smile that made me feel like I 
was sitting in a catapult. 
  The undermining of parents' insurance, which was included in 
the savings package that Sten Andersson was never able to push 
through last spring, was taken care of by Mona Sahlin with the 
help of other combative women members of the Riksdag. 
  The proposal came from Persson's staff, but it was 
unacceptable to the group until Sahlin and several others hit 
upon a compromise that called for pushing the effective date 
back from 1 July to the start of 1995. 
  Before the budget debate in the Riksdag on 10 January, it 
was 
decided in consultation with Ingvar Carlsson that Goran Persson 
would make an "all-out attack." 
  "It is possible in that way to expose one's flank and be 
attacked in return if one does not protect oneself. But I knew 
that we had savings and a better balance than the government 
even if the matter of parents' insurance had not been settled." 
  After 10 January, the temperature at Social Democratic 
headquarters rose several degrees. The budget tussle and new 
calculations every five minutes resulted in the drastic cut of 
1.7 billion kronor from the communications budget on the night 
of 23 January. 
  We asked: "In previous proposals, the Social Democrats 
strongly emphasized the reform proposal that called for removing 
sickness and industrial injury insurance from the budget and 
then eventually increasing it by 45 billion kronor. Is that no 
longer included?" 
  "Our position is the same as before. The change in position 
that may be noted is that we are now putting even more emphasis 
on the dangers involved in the budget deficit and the national 
debt." 
  We said: "Excluding the proposal for direct write-offs, 
which 
will be in effect for only one year, the tax burden on the firms 
will increase under your proposal." 
  He answered: "No, we are not going to increase the tax 
burden 
on companies. We just need time, since it is difficult for 
technical reasons to roll back some of the government's reforms. 
Here it is also important to say that we are not going to cancel 
the tax reduction for self-employed individuals which was 
introduced last fall and which is being financed by taxes on 
foreign travel expenses and a slight increase in employers 
contributions." 
  We asked: "You may benefit businesses, but the businessmen 
will not be allowed to get rich. Isn't that a dilemma?" 
  Persson said: "You are talking like a nonsocialist 
propagandist. We lowered the corporation tax and the tax on 
dividends radically as part of the tax reform. Isn't it 
reasonable to see how that works first? If the reduced tax on 
capital leads to a big inflow of venture capital, it will mean 
that during its term of office, the government will have lowered 
the tax on capital by 25 billion kronor without creating all 
that many jobs." 
<H5>  Can Solve the Problem </H5>
  Persson does not see any lack of venture capital in the 
stock 
market, but he admits that the problem exists for smaller firms. 
  "We have always been open to dialogue with the business 
community, and we can solve this problem, too. But it requires 
that we have some kind of social contract in which everyone must 
be involved and help carry the burden," says Persson. He claims 
that he has no objection at all to businessmen getting rich, 
provided that their wealth is linked to production and that they 
build up something. 
  "On the other hand, we find it very hard to see the point in 
the present situation, in which a small number of people are 
building private fortunes with the help of tax subsidies. The 
danger here is that we will have a rerun of the 1980's!" 
  That warning comes from Goran Persson, who is unlikely to be 
thinking of the same rerun that Carl Bildt has already starting 
warning us of.

  [Text] The memorandum with our country's legal arguments 
that was released by Greece today describes the measures against 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as the 
last means to protect our national interests. An initial 
discussion on the measures will be held at the European Union 
[EU] Commission on Wednesday [2 March]. Our Brussels 
correspondent Nikolaos Belos reports. 
  [Begin Belos recording] The memorandum with Greece's legal 
arguments on the measures against Skopje has been in the hands 
of the EU Commission as of yesterday evening. The memorandum 
was submitted by the Greek Government through diplomatic 
channels. 
  According to a statement made at noon today by the 
Commission's spokesman, the memorandum will be examined by the 
legal department, which will give its opinion in the next few 
days as to whether the case against Greece should or should not 
be brought before the European Court. The spokesman further 
noted that an initial discussion on the Greek measures will be 
held at the Commission's regular weekly meeting on Wednesday. 
  Greece's eight-page memorandum stresses that the government 
found itself in a difficult position in adopting the measures 
against Skopje as a last resort to protect its national 
interests. The national interests were jeopardized because of 
the aggravated situation caused by the unacceptable 
intransigence of Skopje and its insistence on expansionist 
claims. The memorandum describes Greece's decision as a 
political action for the protection of national sovereign 
rights. It also outlines the country's legal arguments with 
regard to the international and EU law. 
  Among other examples of intergovernmental measures adopted 
by 
the EU in the past, the memorandum notes the economic sanctions 
against Argentina in connection with the Falklands, sanctions 
which were demanded by Great Britain. Another example that 
Greece cites in the memorandum is the EU's economic measures 
against Southern Rhodesia, whose aim was to exert pressure on a 
third country. 
  The memorandum stresses in conclusion that the measures 
adopted by the Greek Government to defend its fundamental rights 
do not seek nor do they serve an economic goal but constitute an 
exercise of legal political pressure and fall within the 
possibilities of divergence which the EU law recognizes that 
member states can resort to. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Mary Pini] </F>
  [Excerpt] During a recent visit to Imbros, deputies from 
every party of the Greek Chamber of Deputies ascertained the 
"shrinkage of the Greek community and the outright violation of 
human rights." 
  The same deputies formed a parliamentary interparty 
initiative on Greek issues "to meet the needs of changing 
times," they said. They all signed a declaration aiming at 
salvaging Hellenism outside Greek borders as well as on Imbros 
island. 
  The above were announced yesterday by these deputies during 
a 
news conference held together with members of the association of 
Greeks from Imbros and Constantinople (IKTAR) at the Foreign 
Correspondents Union room. 
  The declaration calls on Greeks everywhere to coordinate 
action in support of human rights, not only in Imbros, but also 
among all people, and calls attention to the danger of losing 
traditions. At the same time, the declaration calls for 
recognizing the rights of Greek Orthodox people outside Greece's 
borders and for maintaining their identity, freedom, and dignity. 
  The declaration also urges implementing international law 
and 
the principles of UN decisions and the international accords in 
Cyprus, Imbros, Tenedos, North Ipiros, and everywhere there are 
Greeks. 
  The deputies noted that in Imbros, there are no schools, 
church or doctor. PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] deputy 
Konstandinos Bandouvas noted that the island's doctor was killed 
last September in a peculiar traffic accident. 
  During the news conference, the deputies stressed that 
everybody demands the establishment of Greek schools in Imbros 
as well as a position for a Greek consular employee. PASOK 
deputy Dhimitrios Vounatsos promised to see that the Greek 
Government raise the issue of schools officially with the 
Turkish Government and international organizations. [passage

  [Excerpt] Istanbul, Feb 28 (A.A.) -- Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller on Monday [28 February] said, "we did not come here to 
support Ataturk, because he does need supporting." 
  Ciller spoke at a rally where thousands of Kemalists 
gathered 
in the streets of Istanbul at noon today as a reaction to the 
anti-Kemalist initiatives of a group of fundamentalist 
parliamentarians. The rally aimed at stressing Turkish citizen's 
dedication to the secular and democratic principles of Mustafa 
Kemal Ataturk (the founder of the modern Republic of Turkey) and 
his reforms. 
  One reason for the sudden surge of Kemalism was a defamatory 
statement made by Prosperity Party (RP) Deputy Hasan Mezarci, 
who called Ataturk an illegitimate child and refused to call him 
"Ataturk," which means "father of Turks." The name was given to 
Ataturk by the Turkish people in 1934 to their hero who led them 
to victory against the invaders of the country. 
  Ciller earlier called for the masses to express their 
respect 
for Ataturk and their reaction to fundamentalists who attempt to 
defame his memory. 
  She said the people's love of Ataturk has passed from 
generation to generation. "No one, not Mezarci, will be able to 
erase the love we have for Ataturk from our hearts," Ciller 
said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
said that the respect for Ataturk rally held in Istanbul today 
violates the election bans. 
  At a news conference in Ankara, Erbakan said that permission 
was not requested for the rally 72 hours earlier, as required by 
the law, and therefore sufficient time was not given to the 
security forces to take the necessary measures. 
  Erbakan charged that the prime minister organized this rally 
for political aims. He added: 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] In order to gather a crowd, she 
invited all our students, all our workers, even all our 
prosecutors to attend the rally even though it was a working 
day. This is a violation of the law, it is a crime. On the 
other hand, the election period is on. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Demirel, the One Who Suffers </F>
Mishaps"] 
  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has been elevated to his 
current post after travelling a long and winding road. He has 
suffered two coups and has bounced back. 
  The military has intervened twice to oust Demirel from 
office, once in 1971 and the second time in 1980. Those of us 
who still want to be kind to him call the coups "mishaps," while 
his critics, who are now growing in number, say in both cases 
Demirel failed to run the country properly and it was his 
incompetence that led to the military takeovers. 
  After the 1980 coup, Demirel became a banned leader. The 
press, with the exception of the TURKISH DAILY NEWS, which 
defied all anti-democratic measures, could not mention his name, 
and many writers started calling him "bir bilen," which means 
"the one who knows." 
  Demirel was under house arrest for a short period and his 
movements were restricted by the military. The years went by 
and true democrats, including some in the TURKISH DAILY NEWS, 
rallied behind him as he launched his successful campaign to get 
the bans lifted. The bans were eventually lifted in a 
referendum, and Demirel started climbing the ladder back to 
power. 
  In 1991 he became prime minister, and then in 1993 he was 
elected president by the Parliament after the sad demise of 
Turgut Ozal. 
  Demirel is a politician of vast experience. But, despite all 
his qualities, either he could not see the 1971 and 1980 coups 
coming or he could not do anything to avoid them. 
  Now he has started to speak of his "deep concerns" about the 
current state of affairs. He has recently said he is concerned 
with the spate of terrorist bomb attacks in major cities. On 
Monday he told a meeting of geology experts: "If the country 
loses its democratic calm, the people will seek calm through the 
fist." Which means if you cannot secure calm and tranquility in 
the country through a democratic environment, then the only way 
will be for the military to do it with an iron fist after a coup. 
  We have given several warnings in the past few years that we 
could end up in the current situation. It is sad that people in 
responsible positions just turned a deaf ear to our warnings and 
are now paying the price. 
  It is also sad that once again people have started 
pronouncing the words "military takeover." It is especially sad 
that such talk has been resurrected when Demirel is the head of 
state and is once again in a responsible position in Turkey. 
  Let us hope Demirel does not go into history books not only 
as the "one who knows," but also as "the one who suffered three 
mishaps." Let us also hope no one turns round and says: "If 
some one suffers so many mishaps then there must be something 
wrong with him."

  [Text] It became known that a team has been formed within 
the Army to undertake a military intervention. According to 
information obtained from military sources, General Dogan 
Bayazit, secretary general of National Security Council [NSC], 
and General Aydin Ilter, the commander of the Gendarmerie 
Forces, are heading the command-level team which is taking 
initiatives for a military intervention. 
  It was reported that there is a deep uneasiness within the 
Armed Forces, and that factions have been formed and that 
polarization between them has increased. 
  It was indicated that Dogan Gures, chief of the General 
Staff, is trying to keep his post by making concessions to the 
team which has set out toward an intervention. 
  The other faction is mostly made up of staff colonels who 
are 
influential in the 1st Army Headquarters in Istanbul. It is 
believed that with the forced retirement of Ground Forces 
Commander Muhittin Fisunoglu, who had distanced himself from the 
Americans after the assassination of [former] Commander of the 
Gendarmerie Forces Esref Bitlis, the way now has been opened to 
the most pro-American forces in the Army. 
  The second faction, however, has taken a position against 
Bayazit for participating in the meetings of the Masonic lodges, 
and against Ilter in connection with the murder of General 
Bahtiyar Aydin, Major Cem Ersever and Commander of the Tunceli 
Regiment Kazim Cillioglu that followed the death of Bitlis. 
<H5>  The Most Pro-American Team Is Making Preparations for a Coup </H5>
  A source close to the 1st Army Headquarters told AYDINLIK: 
"The two factions in the Army are clashing. Preparations are 
under way for a coup. The first faction is the Dogan 
Bayazit-Aydin Ilter team. This is the most pro-American team. 
These are the people who are making preparations for a coup. 
They will turn the elections into a bloodbath. They will 
eliminate their opponents in May. They have now set out to 
install Dogan Bayazit as chief of the General Staff." 
  General Dogan Bayazit, who was appointed as the secretary 
general of NSC set up after 12 September [1980 military 
intervention] as a shadow cabinet, is being described as the 
"most pro-American officer." Bayazit, who despite coming from 
the ordnance service rose in the Army because of his special 
warfare capabilities, is known for his disregard for the law. 
After having been promoted from commander of the General Staff 
Operations Department to the commander of the Aegean Army, he 
was unexpectedly appointed as the general secretary of the NSC. 
Bayazit revamped the general secretariat. With the established 
of the Public Security Unit by a decision made at the latest 
meeting of NSC, Bayazit placed the civilian intelligence 
organization in Turkey under his control. Bayazit's younger 
brother, Admiral Vural Bayazit, is the commander of the Naval 
Forces. Both brothers are pro-American and are in close contact 
with the Masons. 
<H5>  Gendarmerie Is the Strike Force </H5>
  Commander of the Gendarmerie Forces General Aydin Ilter had 
taken part in a coup attempt during the Gulf War. Ilter, who 
had resigned as commander of 7th Army Corps in protest of 
President Turgut Ozal, was later promoted. While still the 
chief of the Ground Forces staff, he was unexpectedly appointed 
commander of the Gendarmerie Forces after the assassination of 
Esref Bitlis. Of all the other armed forces units, the 
Gendarmerie was transformed into the most effective strike force 
against the Kurdish people in the southeast. The Gendarmerie, 
with its 180,000 men, has the most advanced equipment and arms. 
The Gendarmerie, which in the past was the most neglected 
force, has been turned into the most important force because the 
regime finds itself bogged down in the Kurdish problem. In a 
statement to DEFENSE AND AERONAUTICS magazine, he asked for the 
total transfer of the internal security to the Gendarmerie. 
<H5>  "They Will Turn the Elections Into a Bloodbath" </H5>
  It is being claimed the Army team, which has set out toward 
a 
military intervention, will use the elections and 21 March 
Nowruz [Kurdish new year] to execute its plan. The source that 
provided information to AYDINLIK said: "They will turn the 
elections into a bloodbath. They will provoke an Alawi-Sunni 
clash. They will exploit the Sivas incident [when some 30 
people died in a hotel fire last year in protest over a 
conference on The Satanic Verses]. Plans are being 
made for the death of hundreds of people. The government will 
be incapacitated. They are planning major incidents in 
Istanbul, Ankara, Sivas, Kahramanmaras, Yozgat, and Erzerum." 
  The officers who are opposing the coup see the latest 
statement by RP [Welfare Party] deputy Hasan Mezarci and the 
press' exaggeration of it as a plot hatched by the Bayazit-Ilter 
team. They indicated that the distribution of the pro-Ataturk 
pamphlets all over Turkey is being done by this team. 
  It was indicated that under pressure from the pro-coup team, 
Dogan Gures, who after taking over as chief of General Staff 
tried to strike a balance between the Army factions, has 
extracted concessions from the government. 
  There are speculations that by extending Gures' term of 
office the civilians are trying to win him over against coup 
attempts. It was claimed that Gures is trying to keep Ilter and 
Bayazit under control by appointing many of his own followers to 
the Gendarmerie Forces command and NSC General Secretariat. It 
is being reported that ground forces officers have been 
appointed to the critical posts at the Gendarmerie.

  [Text] Ankara -- The Turkish Parliament has postponed a 
10-day recess, which would have ended March 10 as Turkey was 
engulfed this week by rumors of a possible military takeover. 
  Parliamentary sources said that despite Thursday's [24 
February] recess decision, members of the True Path Party (DYP) 
and main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) groups had decided 
such a recess was wrong "in a period in which important 
developments are taking place." 
  Although there was no reference to coup rumors in the 
postponement decision, sources said both the ongoing crisis with 
regard to the Kurdish based Democracy Party [DEP] and the debate 
on a possible military takeover had called for the decision. 
  The DEP started is party assembly meeting on Wednesday to 
decide on whether it would participate in the upcoming March 27 
local elections.

<F P=106> [Column by Sedat Ergin: "The Framework Drawn Up by Ciller </F>
and Denktas"--punctuation as published] 
  [Text] TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President 
Rauf Denktas received us yesterday morning. He seemed rather 
pleased with the outcome of his visit to Ankara. It was obvious 
that Prime Minister Ciller's statement to the True Path Party 
parliamentary group meeting two days ago that "the principle of 
the TRNC's political equality and sovereignty will not be 
abandoned" came as a relief to Denktas. He said: "Prime 
Minister Ciller's statement has given us courage." Making no 
effort to conceal his admiration, Denktas added: "I have 
observed that Prime Minister Ciller maintains a very positive 
approach to the Cyprus problem. She has taken up the issue 
seriously and she knows the content of her file on the problem." 
  Denktas is convinced that he has removed Ankara's anxiety 
about his approach.... He said: "We have ascertained that we 
are no longer regarded as officials who want to create 
difficulties. Officials in Ankara are now far more aware of our 
difficulties in the negotiating process." 
  Those remarks highlighted the most important outcome of 
Denktas' visit to Ankara. Let us explain: The visit removed 
the mutual anxiety of the two sides and renewed the confidence 
between them for the future... Within that framework, Ankara 
received a guarantee from Denktas that "he will remain at the 
negotiating table and not abandon the talks" despite his anxiety 
and his not trusting the new process. In return, Denktas 
received a guarantee from Turkey that Ankara would maintain a 
"steadfast approach" and support him on the problems he may 
encounter when the talks begin. 
  Denktas explained the possible problems during the meeting 
called by President Suleyman Demirel in the presidential palace 
on Monday evening [21 February]. Each time he mentioned a 
problem, he asked whether Ankara would support him if he adopted 
this or that approach. For example, he asked: "Will Ankara 
support me in having a particular number of TRNC citizens settle 
in Maras [Varosha] when that area is transferred to the Greek 
Cypriots?" 
  Denktas received a "yes" to all his questions. 
  The "yes" given to Denktas' question on the transfer of 
Maras 
within the framework of the UN package on confidence-building 
measures was the most important of all. Denktas' question was 
related to the UN view that "the opening of Nicosia Airport will 
take time. So let us not delay the transfer of Maras until 
Nicosia Airport can be opened. Transfer Maras to the UN 
officials and issues relating to the airport can be resolved 
later." 
  Denktas was relieved when Ankara promised to maintain a 
"steadfast approach" toward the simultaneous settlement of the 
two issues. 
  Denktas' visit to Ankara has revealed a striking reality: 
Each and every technical issue in the package of 
confidence-building measures is directly linked with the two 
sides' basic views on the essence of the problem. Therefore, 
they must unavoidably move out of the framework of the 
minipackage and take up the main problem. 
  Considering that, Denktas outlined his anxiety and asked 
several questions in Ankara, questions that may create a 
deadlock in the negotiating process at any time. They are as 
follows: 
  a. What will be the nature of the administration established 
in Maras when it is placed under UN jurisdiction? 
  b. How will the sides share authority in the law courts that 
will be established? 
  c. What will the TRNC citizens use as passports or travel 
documents when they wish to fly out from Nicosia Airport, that 
is, when the airport is opened for the use of the two sides? 
  Denktas' questions enabled the officials in Ankara to better 
understand his problems in the negotiating process. He made an 
important request in connection with the possibility that the UN 
officials might adopt an approach in favor of the Greek Cypriot 
side when the talks begin. He asked that Ankara should move to 
contact the countries concerned, the United States in 
particular, to establish a balance. 
  What remains to be done is for Prime Minister Ciller to move 
to effectively explain to the high-level officials in the United 
States every issue on which she and Denktas have agreed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO/Bosnia: Andreatta on Air </F>
Strike"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 28 Feb (ANSA) -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta, commenting on the downing today by NATO 
fighters of four planes over Bosnia, said that "It seems obvious 
to me that once a rule is set down, it is to be applied." 
  Speaking to journalists on the sidelines of a marathon 
negotiating session underway here since Friday [25 February] to 
enlarge the European Union to include Austria, Finland, Norway 
and Sweden, Andreatta noted that a full report on the episode 
has not yet been compiled and that, until then, a final 
judgement could not be made. "What is certain, is that the 
planes violated the UN resolution banning military flights over 
Bosnia," he went on. If these planes were also involved in an 
attack, then the NATO intervention would have "even further 
justification," he added. 
  Andreatta said that the pilots of the American jets had 
requested and received from their commanders authorization to 
open fire. 
  The Italian foreign minister also pointed out that planes 
like those downed today were at the disposition of Croats, Serbs 
and Bosnian Serbs and that, as a result, the situation was still 
"a bit confused." 
  Ever since UN decreed the no-fly zone over Bosnia, there 
have 
been hundreds of violations, he added, noting however, that it 
was mostly helicopters that had invaded the banned airspace.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Northern League Presents Government </F>
Platform"] 
  [Text] Milan, 27 Feb (ANSA) -- The Northern League on 
Sunday [27 February] presented a 40-page government platform 
based on free market policies and regional federalism. 
  The main points of the program are the following: 
  Economy - The ratio between the deficit and public debt must 
be lower than the ratio between the increase in gross domestic 
product and the GDP itself, states the document, adding that the 
two main lines of approach are: transferring current public 
spending to investments, "reducing waste and useless expenses"; 
restructuring of the public sector, reducing government 
intervention and favoring private initiatives, especially 
through: an overhaul of the public employment sector, a "radical 
change" in the state's shareholdings in industry, privatizations 
and so-called fiscal federalism. 
  Labor -- Unemployment is "the real problem," according to 
the 
League, which is pushing for more flexible working hours. 
  Fiscal federalism -- The two key elements of this catchword 
platform are giving regional administrations total freedom in 
setting local taxes and giving the same administrations spending 
responsibility, in accordance with revenues. The League also 
wants a reduction in personal income taxes and the total number 
of taxes and simpler fiscal procedures. 
  Industrial policy -- A "clear distinction" must be made, 
according to the League, between "development in the north and 
development in the south." The foundation of Italian industry 
must remain small- and medium-sized businesses, which must be 
helped grow by forming consortiums. 
  Immigration -- More restrictive legislation must replace 
existing laws that, according to the League's thinking, make it 
too easy for foreigners to enter the country and obtain 
residence permits. Immigration must be stopped and foreigners 
(presumably from Third World countries) must be allowed to enter 
only if they have work permits. 
  Social Security -- The League wants to set up a regional 
pension system and wants pensions to be calculated according to 
individual payments. 
  The South -- The League wants all state aid to the poorer 
Mezzogiorno [southern] regions stopped and development of a 
region's resources to be commensurate with a drop in the crime 
rate. 
  Education -- Authority must be taken from the ministry and 
given to the regions, with the central government responsible 
only for coordinating the national Conference of regional 
authorities. 
  Justice -- The judiciary must stand in the middle ground 
"between the state and society," the program states, adding that 
trials must no longer be led by more than one judge. 
  Defense -- The Armed Forces must be overhauled and the 
present draft system must be replaced with a mixed 
volunteer-draftee Army. Spending must be reduced and investments 
increased for the volunteer Army and technological updating. 
  Mass media -- The League wants changes mostly in television 
and wants to privatize the public network, RAI. "Clear" rules 
must be made "to protect both broadcasters and citizens." 
  Healthcare -- Regions must be given full autonomy, including 
in running hospitals, and general family practitioners must be 
given a larger role in the system.

<F P=106> [Article by Danny Morrison, a Sinn Fein "strategist": </F>
"Morrison: Why We Haven't Said `Yes'" -- last four paragraphs 
are IRISH PRESS footnote] 
  [Text] On December 15, the BBC broadcast live the release 
of the Downing Street Declaration. 
  Extended bulletins coincided with one of our lock-up periods 
here, but a large number of us put our names down for the 
canteen, where there is a television, and watched events unfold. 
  Whoever first described the Declaration as a "masterpiece of 
ambiguity" was telling no lie. 
  There was little mistaking the smug tone of John Major in 
the 
Commons later that afternoon, when he interpreted the 
Declaration as meaning: 
  "No" to united Ireland, or to the value of achieving a 
United 
Ireland. 
  "No" to joint authority 
  "No" to any change in the Unionist veto. 
  Later, his Government's pro-Unionist bias became even more 
evident when he said: "I have gone to great trouble to ensure 
that the constitutional guarantee is firmly enshrined in the 
joint declaration. 
  "So there can be no doubt that those people who care about 
the Union -- and we are primarily concerned about the people in 
Northern Ireland who care about the Union -- shall have it 
within their own hands, with the full support of the government, 
to remain within the Union for so long as that is their wish." 
  You might think that people serving 25 to 35 years' 
imprisonment would be clutching at every straw, would have been 
reduced to a measure of desperation by the vicissitudes of a 
long, hard, unprecedented and seemingly endless struggle. 
  Not so. 
  Sacrifices have been made, are being made and will continue 
to be made until the conditions for a peace are at least 
approximated. 
  The problem does not lie in the 26 counties. While Albert 
Reynolds is perceived as more sincere and committed than any 
other Taoiseach in the past 25 years, and although he is a 
co-signatory to the Declaration, the fact remains that it is the 
British who exercise power and control over the North -- and 
appear not to be prepared to relinquish or share it. 
  It is the British whom we do not trust. 
  I remember a written British declaration to the Blanket-men 
in December, 1980, offering them peace and progress in this jail 
if they would only end the hunger strike. But when that hunger 
strike was ended, Britain reneged on its declaration and put the 
boot in. 
  The result was the second hunger strike, 10 men dead and 
scores of others killed on the streets. My analogy is that 
acceptance of the Declaration -- about which we do not have all 
the facts -- followed by disillusionment as a result of 
misunderstanding, could put back the hopes for peace. 
  In our contribution to Sinn Fein's Commission for Peace, we 
have said that we realise there will be a crucial stage, "a 
negotiating stage, a time of potential peace and perhaps 
imperfect peace, but a genuine peace, when many of our demands 
may not be met." 
  We have said: "We realise that at such a crucial stage we 
will have to compromise to close gaps, to demonstrate gestures 
of reconciliation, to give assurances and to move the situation 
forward. It is time the British government expressed a similar 
willingness." 
  It appears to have given no ground. In the language of 
"throwing down the gauntlet" and "no quarter" there is no room 
for dissent. 
  It threatens increased repression if we reject the 
Declaration. It refuses to clarify. 
  Are these the actions of a party interested in making peace? 
  Northern Editor Anne Cadwallader writes: Danny Morrison, one 
of the leading political strategists in Sinn Fein over the past 
20 years, is serving an eight-year sentence for false 
imprisonment. 
  In this article, detailing his response to the Declaration, 
he quotes for the first time from the prisoners' submission to 
the Sinn Fein Peace Commission and provides a unique insight 
into party thinking, both inside and outside the Maze [prison]. 
  In the 10 weeks since the Declaration was signed, the 
prisoners have been debating their response, one that will be 
carefully studied by their republican colleagues outside and by 
the two governments. Significantly, as Morrison reveals, the 
prisoners' submission to the Peace Commission refers to the need 
for "compromise," and indicates that Sinn Fein might need to 
accept an "imperfect peace" in the short term. 
  His comments that the republican movement will need to move 
to "close gaps" and make "gestures of reconciliation" is the 
type of language that will be welcomed by the government.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Patron for Peace?"] </F>
  [Text] The call from Moscow made the chancellor proud: 
Boris Yeltsin wanted to discuss NATO's ultimatum for Sarajevo 
first with Helmut Kohl and only afterwards with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and the other Western heads of state. 
  For days, the NATO partners had futilely tried to contact 
Moscow. Now the Russians wanted to talk to the Germans. 
  Unfortunately, Chancellor Kohl was unable to talk to his 
friend and fellow sauna-goer; he was busy otherwise, he was 
traveling around eastern Germany. Altruistically, the 
politicians in Bonn passed the telephone partner from Moscow on 
to the White House in Washington. 
  Yeltsin's respect inflated Bonn's ego considerably. The fact 
that NATO's threat of bombing the Serbs had an effect "is 
primarily also due to my influence," the chancellor praised 
himself. And this influence will grow if he has something to 
say about it. As soon as peace is established in the war in 
Yugoslavia, the Germans want to help with reconstructing the 
tortured country. 
  The times when Germany was just permitted to be an economic 
giant are over. As budding peacemakers, Helmut Kohl and his 
Free Democratic Party Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel ("Germany 
need not hide its light under a bushel") are hoping for the 
glamour of the political stage. 
  The Bonn politicians last week praised their Bosnian 
conference of important diplomats in the former capital as a 
particular highlight of their new foreign policy. Since the 
signing of the treaties on German unification, Foreign Ministry 
officials enthused, interest in Germany had never been as great: 
34 television teams aimed their spotlights on the German 
presenters of "good mediating services" (Kinkel) in the bloody 
Bosnian conflict. 
  The idea of the international conference in Bonn had 
developed during telephone conversations that Kinkel held the 
week before last during a meeting with his Russian colleague 
Andrey Kozyrev in Athens. From there, the German foreign 
minister first startled his U.S. colleague Warren Christopher by 
passing on -- "By the way, colleague Kozyrev is standing right 
beside me" -- the telephone receiver. Later on, the two foreign 
ministers established contact with London's Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd. 
  A new axis? 
  Of course not. Bonn did not become the site of the talks on 
Bosnia at Kinkel's instigation. Others did not want to be the 
host -- out of fear by those in power that they might throw 
themselves open to ridicule with another fruitless discussion. 
  Some countries were not supposed to be the hosts either: 
Greece, which is currently holding the presidency of the 
European Union [EU], has disqualified itself in the view of the 
other Europeans because of its unilateral embargo against 
Macedonia. The Americans did not want to go to Brussels 
because, as a Bonn diplomat said, they did "not" want to go "to 
a European event." 
  The British, whose Lord Owen has earned more criticism than 
praise as EU mediator in Bosnia, refused. They pushed the 
Germans forward. 
  "Everyone knew," some of Kinkel's helpers described the risk 
after the talks, "that this could be a complete failure." 
  However, since the parties to the war were not invited, 
there 
was no quarrel but results -- some that were to increase 
Germany's praise of itself, others that indicated a surprising 
development in civil-war-torn Bosnia. 
  Since the NATO ultimatum against the Serbia besiegers of 
Sarajevo, since the Russian readiness to send soldiers for the 
UN troops there, and since the conference on the Rhine Russians 
and Americans are sitting "in the same boat with us," according 
to Bonn's analysis. The Bosnian initiative, which Foreign 
Minister Kinkel and his Paris counterpart Alain Juppe started 
last year is now generally used as a basis for the further 
search for peace. 
  With the "momentum" (Kinkel) of the NATO ultimatum 
supporting 
them, those participating in the round of talks in Godesberg are 
now supposed to divide the work and push the warring parties in 
Bosnia toward compromises: Together with the Americans, the 
Germans first want to address Croats and Bosnian Muslims, 
because they have great "affinity" (Kinkel) with them. 
  As soon as a separate treaty has been agreed on, the 
Russians 
"will put a curb on the Serbs," according to the distribution of 
roles in the chancellor's office. A cease-fire between Bosnian 
Croats and the government troops came into force last Friday [25 
February] at noon. 
  Finished concepts are in the drawers in Bonn: Bosnia is to 
remain -- for the time being -- in existence as state but only 
in "loose confederation." The regions of the Croats and Serbs 
could "lean" toward Croatia and Serbs -- up to an "economic 
union." The Serbs are even supposed to be given the opportunity 
of leaving the confederation by means of a referendum if they 
want to be ruled by Belgrade. 
  "The biggest and most important initiative of German foreign 
policy for many years" (Kinkel) has, however, a glitch. At the 
end, there is the recognition of Serbian conquests, of "ethnic 
cleansing," and a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which was 
considered totally unacceptable in the West last summer. 
  A new language is now being used in Bonn: This plan does not 
accept a "forcible change of borders." 
  "The time of threats" is over now, it is said. Now it is 
important to crate "incentives" for concluding peace. 
  The most important obstacle so far: The Muslim government in 
Sarajevo has refused for months to agree to a division of the 
country -- as European peace searchers Lord Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg have suggested several times. The United States is 
now going to use its influence on the Bosnians so that the 
Izetbegovic government gives in. 
  Kinkel gives the incentive of "bringing" Bosnia and Croatia 
quickly "close" to the European Union and to provide help for 
reconstructing the areas that have been destroyed by the civil 
war. Kohl's adviser want to bait the regime in Belgrade with 
prospects of a gradual abolition of the economic sanctions. 
  Sarajevo, where Serbian troops are just leaving, is to be 
placed under UN administration for the time being. Mostar, 
which is besieged by the Croats, is to get a German 
administrator on behalf of the European Union, according to some 
ideas that sound rather bold. 
  The "emergency mayor" in Mostar is to be supported by German 
policemen and administrators. Bundeswehr paramedics could 
operate the hospital. Bundeswehr engineers from Germany could 
repair bridges and roads, just as they did in their humanitarian 
mission in Somalia. 
  Civilian experts from the FRG are to reestablish electricity 
supplies and repair water pipes and sewage pipes. "We need a 
lot of personnel," one of Kinkel's helpers says, "but we have 
enormous difficulties finding people who want to go there." 
  Even in Tuzla Germans are supposed to march in as soon as 
the 
Serbs finally put a stop to firing a the airport. As a 
precaution, the Foreign Ministry cautiously asked the Defense 
Ministry whether soldiers who are on leave or have recently been 
discharged would be available for operating the airport. 
  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe is still resisting. He is 
sticking to the chancellor's previous statement that a mission 
by German soldiers in the former Yugoslavia is out of the 
question. 
  Ruehe's resistance will probably crumble if the "vision" of 
his boss Kohl is fulfilled: The chancellor dreams of sealing a 
peace agreement at a summit with the Americans, French, British, 
and Russians -- as President Yeltsin has already publicly 
demanded. 
  The Germans have already taken over "patronage" for a peace 
agreement -- at least that is what the diplomats on the Rhine 
claim. At the summit, they then want to rise to the first ranks 
of international politics in front of everyone's eyes. There 
Germany is to "practically guarantee" peace as one of the "big 
powers" -- that is Kohl's desire. 
  The precondition: The civil war parties must agree. 
  There have been so many cease-fire agreements in the former 
Yugoslavia so far that even experts have lost count. Another 
one came into force last week.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Leo Wieland: "The Foreign Trade President"] </F>
  [Text] The cultivation of normal international relations 
is not one of President Clinton's strengths. In contrast to his 
predecessors Bush and Reagan, who were influenced by experiences 
gained during the war and the post-war period, the younger 
Clinton has a different image of the world. Even though in 
security issues he firmly supports the Transatlantic Alliance 
with NATO as the core and framework, his latest trip to Europe 
cannot hide the fact that the interest in the Old World has 
weakened, while attention to Asia has increased. 
  Some traditional allies, who -- like Margaret Thatcher's 
Great Britain -- had a "special relationship" with the White 
House, feel the atmospheric changes. Prime Minister Major, who 
is expected to visit Washington at the end of February, must 
accept that shortly before his visit, Clinton granted a visa to 
IRA-friendly Irishman Gerry Adams -- disregarding his advisers' 
recommendations and protests from London. 
  However, the fact that Clinton dedicates only a limited 
amount of time to foreign affairs and has a weak team, which 
lacks both Shultz's moral authority as well as Baker's 
diplomatic skills, does not mean that he does not have any 
foreign policy. Its focus is foreign trade. As the U.S. 
foreign trade policy president, Clinton has placed greater 
emphasis on his interest in a "fair share" for his country and 
has prepared old friends and new partners for greater egotism. 
Thus, he did not shy away from open discussions with Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and frankly stated that he prefers no 
agreement over an "empty agreement." The Japanese, who have 
promised to open their markets for decades, but have instead 
busily increased their enormous trade surplus with the United 
States, now have to expect sanctions, regardless of free trade. 
  Almost all of the six foreign policy priorities, which 
Secretary of State Christopher formulated at Clinton's order -- 
economic security, reform in Russia, new shaping of NATO, trade 
with the Far East, peace in the Middle East, and nuclear 
nonproliferation -- are directly or indirectly connected with 
the economy. Clinton himself thinks that the conclusion of the 
GATT talks, the ratification of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), and the attempts at rapprochement at the 
American-Pacific economic conference (APEC) are among his most 
important successes so far. 
  Lifting the longstanding trade embargo against Vietnam also 
fits his political geography, which is linked more strongly with 
interests. In addition to the desire to strengthen Hanoi's 
readiness to cooperate in the search for missing U.S. soldiers, 
the complaint of U.S. businessmen that they would lose a 
potentially lucrative market in Indochina also played an 
essential role. The smoldering quarrel about an extension of 
the most-favored-nation clause for the PRC -- Clinton must 
decide on an extension by summer -- also has two facets: human 
rights and the determination to use this means of pressure to 
urge for a balance of the trade balance, which shows an extreme 
surplus (similar to Japan) for China. 
  The exception from the economically motivated exercises in 
loosening up is right on the U.S. door step: Cuba. So far, 
Clinton has not shown any inclination to lift the 30-year 
blockade of the Castro regime or even just the restrictions on 
travel. The sugar island, which is no longer a military threat 
to Washington because it has lost its godfather in Moscow, would 
certainly be a market. However, in this case, other 
considerations are important, apart from the historical and 
political ones. In contrast to the 10 million Cubans who have 
become poor in communism, there are 1 million refugees who are 
living and prospering in Florida. They have influence, votes, 
and the means to fill the election campaign coffers of 
candidates for president and Congress. As long as Castro clings 
to power, Cuba is, therefore, primarily part of U.S. domestic 
policy. 
  Because of his increasingly criticized "fixation" on Russia, 
Clinton announced that he will put his ostpolitik on a slightly 
broader basis and include the other states of the former Soviet 
Union more. This was done in the interest of denuclearizing 
Ukraine. Ukrainian President Kravchuk can now go on his 
longed-for trip to the United States. Something similar was 
done this week during the visit by Kazakh President Nazarbayev. 
Clinton praised him twice: for economic reforms and for the 
confirmed desire for disarmament. 
  Thanks to its enormous oil and natural gas reserves, which 
are developed mainly with the participation of U.S. companies, 
Kazakhstan is an attractive partner. On this occasion, Clinton 
advised Nazarbayev, who still seems to be unsure regarding his 
tactics, to lay his export pipelines rather through Russia than 
through the territory of America's archenemy Iran. The trade 
relations between Iran and the FRG, which are uncannily 
intensive from Washington's point of view, are still a factor of 
irritation in the U.S.-German relationship, even though they are 
essentially based on an attitude, which is orientated toward 
Germany's own economic prosperity -- an attitude that is not 
alien to Clinton's pragmatic administration in other fields.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sanctions Against Croatia"] </F>
  [Text] It is high time that observers of the tragedy in the 
former Yugoslavia increased the pressure on Croatia and took 
steps to impose UN sanctions against the country based on 
reports in recent days of the deployment of regular Croatian 
forces in the struggles in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If these reports 
are put next to the Serbs' preparations for full military 
mobilization and the deadlocked situation at the peace 
negotiations, the supposition increases that both Serbs and 
Croats are now getting into position for the last push on the 
battlefields and the final division of Bosnia. 
  Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen's move to introduce 
the call for sanctions at next week's meeting of European Union 
foreign ministers is thus, given the present situation, correct 
and necessary. In addition, there are better prospects that the 
sanctions can be made effective and will have some effect as 
compared with the sanctions against Serbia. Croatia's borders 
with Slovenia and Hungary will be easier to monitor than the 
borders between Serbia and her neighbors. Furthermore Croatia is 
far more sensitive to western pressure than the Serbian 
government in Belgrade. As their stated goal, the Croats want to 
link themselves closely to the rest of Europe and even have 
ambitions of becoming a member of the European Union. So the 
prerequisites for the sanctions, or perhaps just the threat of 
invoking them, to affect Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and 
the government in Zagreb are in place. But all of that does not 
remove the impression that the threat is being made far too 
late. It has long been clear that Croatia is deeply involved in 
the war in Bosnia even if there are insistent and unceasing 
denials from the official Croatian side. It is also very obvious 
that statements from Bosnian Croats about eventually being 
incorporated into Croatia have never been convincingly 
contradicted from Zagreb. So there were good reasons to take a 
firm stand against the Croats as parties to the war at a much 
earlier time. The fact that this was not done tells us something 
about the impotence, the divisions, and the lack of 
international activity that have unfortunately characterized the 
rest of the world's stand on the drama in the Balkans right from 
the start. 
  There are exceptions. Yesterday the flow of news from war 
observation posts contained the remarkable bit of information 
that Bosnian Serbs had withdrawn from a blockaded road leading 
to Sarajevo becauses of threats from the UN to use armored tanks 
to clear the road with force. The episode took place 24 hours 
after the UN's top commander in Bosnia announced a new and 
tougher policy to get emergency supplies through. Of course 
there was talk of an isolated incident -- but all the same. Just 
think if this tougher course had been taken somewhat earlier.

  [Excerpts] Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd concluded their meeting 
just a short time ago. The 30-minute meeting reportedly 
examined the latest developments in the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
crisis and on the issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia--FYROM]. There were no comments following the 
meeting. 
  This morning, the British foreign secretary had successive 
meetings with New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert, National 
Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, and Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias. The talks centered on Skopje, the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Cyprus issue. 
  During his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Hurd, the 
chairman of New Democracy outlined the Greek positions on Skopje 
and his proposal for peace in the Balkans. Evert also stressed 
the need to accelerate the dialogue on the Cyprus issue so that 
there will be a specific timetable for the solution of this 
national issue. 
  During his meeting with the British foreign secretary, 
National Defense Minister Arsenis outlined the Greek positions 
regarding the meaning of the unified defense space [between 
Greece and Cyprus] as a factor in peace and security in the 
Mediterranean. Their meeting also examined the situation in the 
Balkans and Greek-Turkish relations. 
  During their two-hour meeting this morning, Foreign Minister 
Papoulias and British Foreign Secretary Hurd discussed Skopje, 
Cyprus, and Greece's relations with the other Balkan countries. 
[passage omitted] 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, who was asked 
today 
to comment on a statement by British Foreign Secretary Hurd 
according to which the measures against Skopje are illegal, 
reiterated that the measures adopted by the Greek Government 
have a political character. He added that the measures have a 
political aim of security and stability in the area. The 
spokesman said that yesterday, the Greek Government finally 
submitted to the responsible European Union committee the legal 
arguments on the issue, which, he said, are of secondary 
importance to the Greek Government.

  [Text] The downing of four aircraft in Bosnia has sparked 
strong concern and feverish consultations in Athens. Naturally, 
the issue arose during UK Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's 
contacts and talks with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, the 
prime minister, and the official opposition leader Miltiadhis 
Evert. 
  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is being constantly 
briefed 
on the developments and the Greek Government maintains an open 
line with Moscow, Belgrade, and Zagreb with the aim of averting 
suspension of the peace talks. Both Mr. Papoulias and his 
British counterpart Douglas Hurd expressed hope that today's 
incident will not hinder the peace process. The following 
report by our correspondent Foivos Kardhis gives the details on 
the British foreign secretary's visit: 
  [Begin recording] [Kardhis] The dogfight in Bosnia raised 
strong concerns in Athens and with Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd, who met 
shortly afterward and expressed hope that it would not become an 
unexpected obstacle to the peace process. Mr. Papoulias and Mr. 
Hurd immediately had telephone conversations with Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin and at noon with Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev. This open line with Moscow stresses 
the West's conviction that this time as well Russia will have a 
decisive role in averting a new crisis. 
  Mr. Papoulias contacted the prime minister twice to convey 
to 
him the latest reports from Bosnia and NATO Headquarters in 
Brussels. 
  Mr. Hurd asserted in a harsh tone that the Atlantic alliance 
is implementing a policy that was already decided upon and will 
do the same in the future, whereas at his news conference he 
noted that the aircraft were shot down because unlike former 
violations of the no-fly zones, which were isolated, this time 
the operation involved a whole formation. 
  However, nobody aims at a new escalation of tensions in 
Bosnia a few days after the decision of [words indistinct] 
military involvement by the West with the expiration of the 
ultimatum on Sarajevo. 
  [Papoulias] It is our joint conviction that, no matter how 
unpleasant and difficult what happened is, it cannot revoke the 
[words indistinct] peace process. [end recording]

  [Text] Silvio Berlusconi has unveiled his plan for 
government. It is almost 100 pages long and is a recipe for the 
creation of what the Forza Italia leader calls the new Italian 
economic miracle. Renato Andreolassi reports from Milan. 
  [Andreolassi] A whole day of meetings with Forza Italia 
candidates who all had their electoral kits with them, in order 
to discuss the outline of the political program. This was 
followed by a news conference. 
  Silvio Berlusconi responded to journalists in calm and firm 
tones. Above all he replied to the bullets fired by Bossi on 
the themes of enemies and false friends. Berlusconi said that 
he would not accept provocation and that he would not fall into 
the trap of replying to questions in argumentative tones and 
therefore sparking off further debate. He said that Forza 
Italia is fighting for a new strategy, a new political plan 
which aims to give this country a majority, liberal democrat 
government. He added that the movement is presenting itself in 
the election along with other forces in order to defeat the 
Left, which is responsible for out-of-control public spending. 
  Let's see what the main points of Forza Italia's political 
program are. 
  [Reporter Anna La Rosa] Reduction in the number of taxes 
from 
200 to not more than 10, and no taxes at all for the poorest 
members of society; removing the management of taxes from 
central government and handing it over to local authorities. 
Public spending must be reduced, its growth is the root of all 
evil. Forza Italia would encourage new businesses and would 
levy no taxes on newly-created work places. There would be the 
progressive privatization for all state-owned companies, and 
above all direct presidential elections. 
  There would be fewer laws, but more judges and a reduction 
in 
the use of preventive detention. There would be a report on the 
armed forces and increase in their resources. 
  Forza Italia would impose fewer taxes on one-income families 
and a crackdown on the distribution of drugs. There would be a 
gradual transition from the public pension system to a private 
one, however, guaranteeing help for those who are less well-off.

  [Text] Rome -- [Budget Minister and progressive candidate] 
Spaventa wins in Rome, [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, 
Secretary] Occhetto in Bologna, [National Alliance, AN, member] 
Alessandra Mussolini in Naples, and [League Secretary] Bossi in 
Milan. These are the results of a survey conducted by CIRM 
[Italian Center for Market Research] for the weekly PANORAMA. A 
sample of 2,400 voters was tested in the four constituencies 
cited on 21 and 22 February, with results allowing for a margin 
of error of more or less 4 percent. More specifically, 
progressive candidate Luigi Spaventa won 23 percent of the vote 
in Rome, followed closely by [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi with 22 percent of the vote. Center candidate 
Alberto Michelini got 11 percent. In Milan, the survey predicts 
that Bossi can muster 32 percent of the vote, well ahead of the 
progressive Bassani, whose share of the vote was 17 percent. 
Center candidate Gianni Rivera got 11 percent, and MSI [Italian 
Social movement] member La Russa 8 percent. 
  In Naples, support for Alessandra Mussolini was at 30 
percent, whereas her direct progressive rival, Maria Fortuna, 
won 19 percent of the vote. Finally, in Bologna the winner was 
Achille Occhetto (27 percent), well ahead of right-wing 
coalition candidate Pierferdinando Casini (15 percent). The 
third place was taken by [Radical] Pannella-list candidate 
Olivero Toscani, with 8 percent of the vote. 
  The CIRM survey confirmed the national percentage of the 
"undecided," estimated at 28 percent. This percentage, however, 
was much higher in the four constituencies in question: In 
Naples, 45 percent of the voters had not yet made up their 
minds, in Rome 43 percent, and in Bologna 37 percent. Only in 
Milan was the percentage of the undecided equal to the national 
average, namely, 28 percent.

  [Text] Mafia and bribes. Businessmen fess Up. Payolas to 
the bosses. So they can work. In the south as well as the north. 
Even after "Clean Hands." And what if one rebels against the 
blackmail? One quits. Or escapes abroad. That is the astounding 
result of a survey carried out among young businessmen. Who 
nevertheless have not lost hope that Di Pietro &amp; Co.... 
  Pino Arlacchi teaches Applied Sociology at the College of 
Political Sciences, University of Florence, and is considered 
the leading Italian scholar on organized crime. The research for 
this article was coordinated, from the standpoint of 
methodology, by Professor Alberto Marradi of the University of 
Florence, and was carried out by a team of researchers of the 
ARS (Association for Social Research) of Florence. 
  The young businessmen of Confindustria [General 
Confederation 
of Italian Industry] have had the courage to press for a survey 
of corruption and Mafia criminality--a survey that has long been 
urged but never carried out, until now, because it would be 
disturbing, possibly upsetting, to the paunchy and not 
altogether sound nor transparent body of Italy's industrial 
capitalism. The survey set out to measure the extent of the 
bribery system before and after "Clean Hands," assess the damage 
inflicted by organized crime on productive companies and on the 
development of southern Italy, and to provide an idea of the 
depth of penetration of the country's small and medium-sized 
industries by dirty money. A sector, that is, in which the 
almost 800 heads of companies who responded to the questionnaire 
sent to the 7,563 members of the Association of Young 
Businessmen operate. 
  The survey was based on the assumption that a large sector 
exists consisting of clean businesses and businessmen who have 
been damaged by unfair and/or violent competition on the part of 
dirty and politically protected businesses and businessmen. 
  To the question on the occasional or compulsory practice of 
payment of bribe money to obtain public contracts prior to the 
investigation of corruption, 85 percent responded affirmatively. 
This 85 percent encompasses much of the Italian anomaly in the 
field of corruption. According to the considered opinion of the 
company heads, in no other developed Western country are the 
vast majority of companies compelled to pay bribe money to its 
public works and services contracting officials on an ongoing 
regular or occasional basis. 
<H5>  Inflation? Blame It on Bribes </H5>
  The cited figure proves homogeneous for the entire national 
territory in that individual values range from a minimum of 82 
percent who responded affirmatively in the north-central regions 
(Umbria, Tuscany, Marche, Emilia Romagna, and Sardinia), to a 
maximum of 98 percent of affirmative responses by businessmen 
residing in the three regions in which organized crime is most 
deeply rooted (Sicily, Calabria, and Campania). 
  The results of the survey therefore provide a confirmation 
of 
evaluations that insist upon the rational and systemic nature of 
corruption. The differences between North and South, and between 
"mafiose" zones and "nonmafiose" areas are not such as to 
justify attributing exclusively to Southern Italy, or to mafia 
presence, the degrading of relations between the economy and 
governmental authority. They provide no basis in fact for 
postulating a division of the country between a supposed clean, 
productive North, where the government and the enterprises 
working for it benefit from ethics and behavior typical of 
"advanced development," and a supposed South pervaded by an 
outlaw mentality and praxis. 
  The totalizing dimension of the pre-Clean Hands incidence of 
corruption that emerges from this survey does lead, however, to 
deductions of a politico-economic nature. When the payment of a 
sum of money becomes a common practice, a compelling or quasi 
compelling custom incumbent upon all the businesses in a given 
sector, it will tend to be considered as a tax and to be 
transferred to final prices. The businesses that sell public 
works or services will pad their cost estimates and will request 
upward revisions in ongoing works projects to cover this "tax." 
And in the final analysis, the entire cost of those public 
works, and of the kickbacks and bribes included therein, is 
borne by the taxpaying citizens. 
<H5>  Enter Clean Hands </H5>
  In the case of generalized extortive 
racketeering--commonplace in Italy, especially in the commercial 
operations sector--the costs of bribe money translate into price 
increases and in this case are borne by the consumer-citizen. 
  In both cases, the effect is inflationary and its costs are 
not borne by the givers or receivers of the bribes, who 
therefore, for their part, have no great interest in breaking 
the circuit of solidary "omerta" [the mafia code of silence], or 
in rebelling. The corruption machine ran smoothly for over a 
decade with the consensus or support of the partners, until the 
Milan magistrates intervened. But the magistrates intervened on 
the basis of concerns other than the rise of the inflation rate. 
  The unraveling of the system at the stitches came about by 
way of "little episodes" of internal origin into which the 
action of a third power--the judiciary authority--began to delve 
and eventually dismantled the gearing of the machine, but not as 
the result of a collective protest action by the system's 
entrepreneurial component. The entrepreneurial system itself 
mounted no opposition whatever, either on principle or in 
practice, to the praxis of bribery. 
  Out of loyalty to the amoralist and familist tradition of a 
certain Italian capitalism? In keeping with an economic ethic 
averse to "protestation?" The point is arguable. 
  The responses to the question on changes in the system of 
kickbacks after the advent of Clean Hands indicate a situation 
that is by all means positive, in that there has unquestionably 
been a change, but by no means certain as to its long-term 
effects. The entrepreneurs who responded to the question on 
continued payment of bribe money after the judiciary 
investigations of corruption are divided as follows: 
  a) 42 percent stated that "the practice has greatly 
diminished"; 
  b) 40 percent judged that "the practice is slightly less 
widespread" than before; 
  c) only 5.5 percent considered that the practice "has 
disappeared"; 
  d) 13 percent deemed that "bribe money continues to be paid 
as before." 
  The evaluations are clearly cautious, pointing more toward 
the reality of a transition than of an acquired success with a 
permanent future. If the responses objectively reflect a factual 
situation, we find ourselves confronting a serious crisis, in 
terms of the compactness and cogency of corruption, that could 
lead to a split of the enterprise system into two sectors: those 
enterprises that "pay," and those that refuse to pay bribe money 
because the magistracy's growing pressure will render 
inoperative any possible retaliation by the government 
contracting officials. 
  Any illusions as to the coming about of a duality of this 
nature within the intermediate term are best avoided. The 
enterprises that "pay" will in any case, sooner or later, end up 
with a competitive advantage over those that refuse to submit. 
The extra cost borne by the enterprises that pay will shrink 
their immediate profits, but this shrinkage will be more than 
offset by the most-favored-enterprise treatment they will 
receive in terms of future contracts reserved for them by 
corrupt contracting officials. 
  The results of the survey relative to the damages and 
distortions induced by the presence of organized crime in the 
national economy and individual regional economies present a 
mixed composition of lights and shadows. While marketplace 
relations at a few levels have been affected to what is still a 
minor extent by the criminal investigations, they have been hit 
in a severe and alarming way at other levels. These are the most 
sensitive levels, in that they concern investment decisions and 
the growth of existing enterprises. 
<H5>  When Corruption Nullifies the Market </H5>
  To the question regarding constraints on the buying and 
selling of capital goods and raw materials, the overwhelming 
majority--87 percent, or 659 in absolute figures--of the 
entrepreneurs who responded ruled out the presence of 
constraints of any nature whatever. This proportion drops to 72 
percent in the three regions at maximum risk, where 13 percent 
of the respondents stated that they are bound by constraints 
stemming from "threats" or the "fear of incurring unpleasant 
consequences." The ratio is 3.3 percent for the country as a 
whole. 
  These figures appear to contradict the cataclysmic 
assessments of the extent of penetration and direct conditioning 
of the Italian industrial markets by criminal enterprises and by 
the economic and political power coalitions linked with them. 
and to indicate the continued existence of abundant and 
broad-ranging free-market potentialities today in the industrial 
fabric of the regions most stricken by the mafia pathology. 
  The measurement of the influence exerted by organized crime, 
and blackmail of a politico-administrative nature, on the 
bidding for public works contracts, as evaluated by this survey, 
confirms evaluations obtained by other means. To the question: 
"Have you ever had to refrain from bidding on a public works 
contract because of pressures or threats?" 73 percent of the 
young entrepreneurs who responded stated that they had not. But 
this "no" consists of a minority of contractors operating in the 
high-risk regions and a more substantial majority of contractors 
residing in other regions. In Calabria, Sicily, and Campania, 
only 42 percent of the respondents stated that they had not been 
compelled to forgo competitive bidding on a public works 
contract. All of 23 percent stated that they had abstained 
because of threats they had received from competitors tied to 
organized crime, and 35 percent because of constrictive 
pressures of other nature. Given the close ties or simply the 
coincidence between Southern Italy's corrupt politics and the 
mafia powers there, it is not far-fetched to deduce that the 
latter two figures can be combined. This gives us a total of 58 
percent of the heads of small and medium-sized enterprises in 
Italy's more polluted South being compelled by the force of 
politico-mafioso intimidation to renounce one of their 
fundamental rights. 
  The question on compulsory cession of capital shares 
produced 
a significant confirmation of the progression of degenerative 
factors in the economy of broad zones of Southern Italy. 
  Overall, 85 percent of the respondents denied the existence 
of this pathology in the zones of their respective activities. 
But the division of the country in this respect emerged very 
sharply. While 93 percent of the entrepreneurs operating in 
Lombardy reported absence of the practice of compulsory cession 
of shares by enterprises, 53 percent of the heads of enterprises 
in Calabria, Sicily, and Campania reported a massive presence of 
this pathology there. If the latter figure can be taken as 
representative of the entire regional business community there, 
it follows that the presence of capital generated by organized 
crime or political corruption influences directly the ownership 
of approximately half the industrial enterprises of three 
Italian regions, in which 12.6 million people, or approximately 
one fifth of the Italian population, live. 
<H5>  Diffusion of Tainted Capital </H5>
  It is in the capital market that research finds the source 
of 
a full-fledged "criminal unification" of the country. To the 
question on the presence, in the responder's zone of activity, 
of companies benefiting from the inflow of capital of dubious 
origin, only 38 percent responded negatively. All of 54 percent 
of the respondents as a whole stated that "some" enterprises 
benefit from tainted capital, and 6.4 percent stated that there 
were many such enterprises. The perecentage of entrepreneurs who 
affirm the existence of at least some suspicious enterprises in 
their zone of activity is notably homogeneous. The band of 
variations around this figure was narrow, ranging from a minimum 
of 53 percent in the central and northern regions to a maximum 
of 59 percent in the northwestern regions. 
  The results of this study thus confirm the view that divides 
the expansion of capital and illicit investments in Italy into 
two fundamental periods. The first, in which profits, both 
lawful and unlawful, of the criminal enterprises were 
transformed into investments and bank deposits in the areas of 
interest to the criminal groups, provoking an exodus of "clean" 
enterprises and capital, and a stagnation of Southern Italy's 
economy, is identifiable with the 1970's. The second period 
began in the 1980's and is still in progress. It is 
characterized by an emigration from Southern Italy not only of 
clean capital, but also of tainted capital in search of 
exploitable opportunities and camouflage, which are no longer 
possible in their areas of origin that were degraded and 
depressed during the preceding decade. It can therefore be 
stated that some 20 years of expansion of illicit activities in 
our country have created a situation in which the presence of 
capital of criminal origin in virtually every geographical zone 
and economic sector is highly probable. 
  The greatest damage inflicted on southern Italy's economy by 
the presence of political corruption and organized crime is not 
the imposition of kickbacks, payment of bribe money, and other 
forms of graft that distress the heads of industries and 
translate into blackmail, threats, and damage to dissenters. 
This is just the most visible and obvious aspect. 
  The greatest damage is that which does not meet the eye. It 
is expressed in the impeding of business growth, a crippling, 
"silent" flight of capital from the region, and in the deterring 
of investment in the region by northern investors. These 
pathologies represent today perhaps the main obstacles to a 
takeoff of Southern Italy's economy. Turning to the question on 
abstention from investment in the entrepreneur's own region 
because of the dominant criminal activity there, the ratio of 
resident businessmen who responded affirmatively in the three 
regions that are traditional mafia strongholds was 27 percent, 
versus 3 percent for the nation as a whole, and 1 percent for 
Northern Italy. The discouraging effect on private investment 
directly attributable to organized crime involves one fourth of 
the young entrepreneurs in Calabria, Sicily, and Campania. 
<H5>  Defeat the Mafia, for Economic Development </H5>
  If the foregoing figures are taken as indicative of the 
ratio 
of capital investment being deterred, and if the fact is taken 
into account that the young entrepreneurs comprise the most 
dynamic, and the "most resistant to discouragement," sector of 
the business community, it can be said that the presence of 
organized crime is responsible for a "shortfall" of a good one 
third of investments, production, employment, and revenue. 
  In other words, it can be stated that a winning strategy for 
countering the mafia and corruption could contribute to raising 
by about one third the fundamental economic variables of the 
most polluted regions. 
  To the above-indicated dynamics must be added the 
consequences of the shortfall of investments from outside the 
economic system of the high-risk zone itself and of Southern 
Italy as a whole. Between 25 and 26 percent of the entrepreneurs 
operating in Northern Italy's most industrialized regions 
reported having decided not to invest "in one or more zones" of 
the country, specifically owing to the presence of organized 
crime in the zones of interest.

<F P=106> [Roberto Petrini report: "Exports Lead Recovery"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- The first seal on the ISTAT [Central 
Statistics Institute] certificate which guarantees the 1994 
recovery was affixed by Confindustria [General Confederation of 
Italian Industry] President Luigi Abete. "In Italy there is a 
slow but constant recovery in the real economy," he announced 
yesterday during a meeting at the Milan Fair. That was a 
statement made under the banner of a cautious, yet decisive, 
optimism on the fate of our economy, which has come out of a 
disastrous 1993. 
  "The recovery," Abete explained, "depends on the driving 
effect which the high capacity of Italian businesses to compete 
on international markets is also shifting onto domestic 
production." The Confindustria president added that "there is a 
slight upturn in domestic consumption in Italy," following the 
downturn in the entire European economy. 
  So there is optimism, but it is tempered by a good shot of 
caution. "We must not have sudden expectations of growth," 
Abete added, "but we must be confident that this positive trend 
will continue and that it should not be disturbed in its 
evolution." According to Abete, the progress shown by some 
economic indicators, such as industrial production, "will allow 
us to have a 1994 that is certainly better than 1993, and to 
consolidate the competitive ability of our economy, which could 
bear considerable fruit in 1995." 
  So is the recovery under way? The road is certainly not a 
downhill one, but a lot will depend on the economic policy 
measures taken by the next government. Despite the recent 
reduction in the discount rate to 7.5 percent, the knotty matter 
of interest rates remains unresolved. In order to assist in the 
recovery, interest rates "must drop further, not just in Italy 
but in Europe too." The industrialist leader concluded by 
saying that "we are waiting with confidence for this to be 
verified in the coming months." However, there are still other 
obstacles: such as the public-sector deficit, which this year 
seems destined to exceed current estimates, and above all, the 
employment crisis. The ISCO [National Institute for the Study 
of the Economic Situation] report recently released highlights 
the fact that the economic recovery will not be enough to 
guarantee a recovery on the employment front; this year 
unemployment is to rise another 1.2 percent following the 2.8 
percent upsurge in 1993. 
  In the complex profile of Italy Inc., increasingly strong 
indicators are emerging every day which indicate a revival in 
the economy as well as signals that suggest caution. It is 
definitely the former which have prevailed recently: Industrial 
production grew in the three-month period from December to 
February and the import/export figure, which in 1993 -- as the 
Italian Exchange Office pointed out yesterday -- chalked up a 
credit of around 11 trillion lire, compared with a deficit of 
15.8 trillion in 1992. Judging by the most recent data 
available, industry sales are still stagnant: The data for last 
October, released yesterday by ISTAT, mention modest growth of 
around 1.3 percent and only 1.6 percent in the first 10 months 
of the year -- well below the rate of inflation. Reading these 
data help paint a picture of the tough 1993 experienced by our 
economy: Industry sales for the domestic market dropped 2.6 
percent in the first 10 months of last year. It was only export 
sales that rose, i.e., by 15.6 percent. The poor progress made 
in regulating industry confirms last year's dreadful 
performance: In the first 10 months, domestic orders dropped 
10.2 percent, while foreign orders provided oxygen for demand, 
chalking up growth of 16.9 percent. Strewn among the light and 
shadow of 1993, other signs can also be perceived: for example, 
the massive drop (down 37 percent) in gas consumption by the 
chemical industry reported by SNAM [National Gas Pipeline 
Company], which was nevertheless offset by the increase in 
household consumption. 
  However, Alessandro Cocirio, president of CONFAPI [National 
Confederation of Small Manufacturers], the association which 
counts around 35,000 small manufacturers, is resolutely against 
the optimism of recent days. "Before saying that there is a 
recovery," he said yesterday, "I would think about it a bit. I 
would definitely talk about a reversal of the trend. The crisis 
in Italy began in 1990 and by December 1992 we were in an 
extremely tough period that followed the exchange rate upheavals 
and devaluation. So, comparing the data from December 1993 with 
the data from back then is not a very wise thing to do." 
Cocirio sees a drab picture for the future too. "The trade 
balance," he explained, "is also feeling the effect of the drop 
in imports as a result of the drastic drop in domestic demand. 
When domestic demand starts to pick up, it will head toward 
goods which come from abroad. Consequently, Italian businesses 
will sell less and experience a negative effect." 
  Returning to the annual data on the trade balance and 
exchange rates, the best results were achieved in the mechanics 
sector (the credit rose by some 9 trillion), the transport 
sector (which recovered almost 7 trillion over the sea of red 
ink booked in 1992), and the metalworking sector. Most 
prominent from the geographical point of view is the clear-cut 
improvement in Italian trade with a number of key countries. 
With Germany there was a spectacular turnaround in the trade 
balance, which rose from a deficit of more than 3.6 trillion to 
a credit of 2.4 trillion, while with the United States the 
credit rose fivefold [as published], from 1.3 trillion to more 
than 5.6 billion.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "Sweden, Finland, and Austria Place </F>
One Foot in the European Union"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 2 Mar (BELGA) -- On Tuesday [1 March], 
several hours after the planned deadline, and after four days of 
exhausting bargaining, Sweden, Finland, and Austria entered the 
door leading into the European Union (EU), but they will remain 
in the vestibule until the 12 national Parliaments of the 
members states of the EU, the European Parliament (EP), and 
their own respective electorates have given their backing to 
these new memberships. 
  At 2100 GMT on Tuesday evening, after having "tied up" the 
Swedish and Finnish dossiers, the Twelve managed to conclude the 
talks with Austria, which balked for a long time on the question 
of the transit of EU trucks across its high mountain pastures. 
  Thus, on Tuesday the EU entered a new era, that of the 
community of 15 member states, or even 16 if the negotiations 
with Norway, which are still stymied over the obstacle 
represented by fishing, are brought to an end within the next 
few days. 
  "I have rarely felt as happy as I did after going 100 hours 
without sleep," said Hans Van Den Broek, the European 
Commissioner responsible for external political relations, at a 
press conference. 
  The success of the negotiations with these three countries 
"demonstrates that the EU is not a closed space," emphasized 
Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos, whose 
country has the presidency of the Council of the Twelve for six 
months. 
  "We have laid the foundations of a greater Europe which now 
needs to be consolidated and strengthened at its structural 
level, as is due to happen at the intergovernmental conference 
planned for 1996," he added. 
  The slight delay in the negotiations, compared with the 
planned schedule, should not prevent the EP from receiving the 
treaties of accession and ratifying them on 7 May, indicated 
Hans van den Broek. 
  According to Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, the 
financial concessions made by the Twelve, especially with a view 
to "sweetening the pill" of the brutal opening of the borders of 
the candidate member states to the Community's agricultural 
products, which are much cheaper than their domestic produce, 
and in order to satisfy their desire to see the Arctic regions, 
with their low density populations, sustained, will merely limit 
the profits that the EU will obtain when they join. 
  "From the very first year, the new member states will be net 
contributors to the Community budget," assured Mr. Claes. 
  For example, Sweden will be granted a transitional period, 
allowing it not to contribute 100 percent to the EU budget. 
Moreover, Stockholm has secured financial aid for its farmers 
worth ECU435 million (17.4 billion Belgian francs [BFr] -- BELGA 
editor's note) over a four-year period. 
  Meanwhile, Finland will see 85 percent of its farmland 
deemed 
eligible for European agricultural subsidies, with the remaining 
15 percent being able to benefit from national subsidies. 
Between 1995 (the planned date of accession -- BELGA editor's 
note) and 1999, Helsinki will also receive ECU340 million 
(BFr13.6 billion -- BELGA editor's note) per annum in regional 
aid, in order to boost the development of the poorest, least 
populated regions of the country. 
  On Tuesday evening, the negotiators for the EU and Austria 
succeeded in eliminating the last bone of contention which was 
preventing Vienna from following in the footsteps of its 
Scandinavian fellow candidates. 
  The prickly question of road transit was finally settled. 
The solution allows for the possibility of maintaining the 
current agreement until 1 January 1998, then extending it until 
1 January 2001, barring a unanimous decision to the contrary by 
the Council, which is virtually impossible, since Austria will 
then belong to it. 
  The final stage, also lasting three years, will be linked to 
a preliminary study by the European Commission. If this study 
concludes that the Austrian requirement that polluting emissions 
be reduced by 60 percent has been fulfilled, then the agreement 
will be abolished. Should this not be the case, the transit 
agreement would be relaunched for three years, unless a 
qualified majority in the Council decided on an alternative 
system enabling the same objective to be reached. 
  However, the Norwegian case remains to be solved. The 
negotiators managed to clear an appreciable amount of ground, 
reaching agreement on the dossiers on taxation and agriculture, 
indicated Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos. 
  On the other hand, the question of access for Community 
boats 
to the extremely fish-rich Norwegian waters remains in abeyance, 
but Mr. Pangalos let it be known that he hoped to conclude a 
global political agreement as early as next Tuesday, or at any 
rate by the end of the month. 
  The Twelve will still also have to agree on the adaptation 
of 
the institutions, and especially the apportionment of the votes 
within the Council of Ministers, as well as on the question of 
the inclusion of the new member states in the convergence 
criteria planned within the context of Economic and Monetary 
Union (EMU). 
  "However, that will not prevent the enlargement process from 
being concluded. Moreover, work on drafting the treaties of 
accession already started one month ago," concluded Mr. Pangalos.

<F P=106> [Tony Barber report: "Western Governments Owe Public an </F>
Explanation on Bosnia"] 
  [Text] It has taken 45 years, but it has finally happened. 
NATO, the strongest military alliance in history, the defender 
of Western civilisation, the guardian of individual liberty, has 
fired its first shots in anger. We are in a new world. 
  The destruction of four Serbian planes over central 
Bosnia-Herzegovina yesterday does not mean that the West is 
engaged in a full-scale war. But those explosions in the skies 
have changed the structure of international relations. Gone is 
the black-and-white world of East-West confrontation. Gone, 
too, is the fleeting mirage of a New World Order, a place where 
responsible powers were supposed to work together for the cause 
of security. Welcome, instead, to a world of uncertainty and 
upheaval, of clashing nationalisms and murky wars where the West 
thinks, but is not quite sure, that it must unleash its weapons 
for the sake of its own credibility. 
  When the foreign ministers of 12 Western countries signed 
the 
treaty establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation on 4 
April 1949, it is a fair bet that none of them expected the 
alliance to fire its first shots in the middle of the Balkans. 
Berlin, perhaps, but not a few miles from Banja Luka, a place 
that lies outside NATO's frontiers. 
  Now that NATO has struck, the West has no escape route from 
Bosnia short of utter humiliation. It is therefore a matter of 
the highest urgency for Western governments to tell their 
publics what, precisely, is the goal of NATO policy in the 
Balkans. Since the wars of the Yugoslav succession broke out in 
June 1991, there have been too many switches of direction, too 
many disputes inside the Western alliance, too much confusion 
over how far to involve the Russians and, above all, too little 
long-term thinking. 
  This is not a conflict like the Gulf war against Iraq. 
There, the West had a clearly defined and legitimate objective: 
to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. If, in the course of 
that action, Saddam Husayn was prevented from posing a future 
threat to other countries in the region, including Israel, then 
that, too, was a reasonable objective. 
  But in Bosnia, as in the rest of former Yugoslavia and the 
Balkans as a whole, it has never been clear what the West stands 
for. Shots have been fired, aircraft have been destroyed, but 
in the name of what? We have a military policy, but our 
political strategy lacks coherence. 
  It is instructive to recall that, only three summers ago, 
the 
West was upholding the principle of a united Yugoslavia. 
Slovenia and Croatia were warned against secession. By the end 
of 1991, a complete reversal of policy had taken place and the 
West was promoting Slovenian and Croatian independence. 
  The consequence was that the West also had to endorse 
independence for Bosnia-Herzegovina, for otherwise the Muslims 
and Croats of that republic would be vulnerable minorities in a 
Serbian-dominated rump Yugoslavia. But the West then did 
absolutely nothing to protect Bosnia. It admitted the newly 
independent state into the United Nations at a time when it was 
clear that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President 
Franjo Tudjman of Croatia were colluding in Bosnia's partition. 
  By mid-l992, the damage was done. The West had adopted the 
mantle of Bosnia's protector but refused to come to its defence. 
Making the best of a bad job, Lord Owen and Cyrus Vance, the 
West's mediators, devised a plan for turning Bosnia into a 
republic of 10 provinces in which the central government's 
powers would be kept to a minimum and Muslims, Serbs and Croats 
would, as far as possible, administer their own affairs. It was 
in principle not a bad plan, for at least it preserved the idea 
of Bosnia's territorial integrity. But it had several flaws. 
First, it needed a substantial commitment of UN forces to be 
workable, and Western governments could not summon the will for 
such an operation. Second, it appeared to reward the Serbs with 
land, where Muslims were the largest nationality before they 
were subjected to killings and forced expulsions. It also 
handed Mostar to the Croats, though the town had a slight Muslim 
majority before the war. This led to the third flaw: the 
absence of US support for the plan on the grounds that it was 
unfair. 
  The next Western initiative came close to acknowledging 
that Bosnia had ceased to exist. It was a plan, again bearing 
Lord Owen's stamp, that called for a three-way division of 
Bosnia into Serbian, Croatian and Muslim regions. Few seriously 
expected that the Serbian and Croatian areas would refrain from 
merging with Serbia and Croatia proper. Even fewer considered 
how to organise the massive population transfers that would be 
necessary to implement the plan. 
  As before, the United States -- backed by Germany -- 
withheld 
support from the proposal. Why should the Muslims be pushed 
into an unjust settlement? It was a fair point, and it buried 
the plan. But still there was no agreed Western policy. 
  The Sarajevo marketplace massacre last month caused the buck 
of Bosnian peace-making to pass to the Americans. Their idea is 
to construct a Muslim-Croat unit in Bosnia that will then form 
an alliance, possibly even an administrative connection, with 
Croatia. 
  But this initiative begs important questions. Does the West 
uphold the principle of Bosnia's unity, or is it saying that, 
once the Muslims and Croats are packaged together, the Bosnian 
Serbs can merge with Serbia? If the latter, then what about all 
the towns on the Drina river in eastern Bosnia where the Serbs 
tore Muslim communities to shreds in 1992? If the Serbs are to 
retain these towns, and ultimately end up with about half of 
Bosnia, then what was the point of destroying four Serbian light 
attack aircraft yesterday? 
  But if the opposite is true, and the West wants to keep 
Bosnia together, then how will it impose such a settlement on 
the Serbs? Is the West proposing to beat the Serbs into 
submission by force? If so, has the West taken into account the 
implications of Russian opposition? 
  If Western countries take the view that they have no 
fundamental interests in the Balkans worth a confrontation with 
Russia, then their governments should tell us so explicitly and 
admit that a Bosnian settlement will involve a degree of 
injustice. At the moment, we have the worst of both worlds: 
highmindedness and irresolution. Couple that with military 
action undertaken without a clear purpose, and the only 
certainty is that the world is rapidly becoming less safe.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Four Fall From the Sky"] </F>
  [Text] The shooting down of the four Bosnian Serb aircraft 
was a chance event which could hardly be avoided. The U.S. 
planes were acting within the terms of the no-fly-zone 
resolution authorised by the Security Council nearly a year ago. 
Though the zone has been repeatedly violated by helicopter 
flights on all three sides, this is the first time in months 
that fixed-wing aircraft have defied the ban. Eyewitness 
accounts appear to confirm that the six Bosnian Serb Galebs (two 
got away) were making a bombing raid against targets on the 
ground and had inflicted significant damage. We do not know 
whether their flight was intended as a deliberate challenge and 
if so, by what level of the Bosnian Serb leadership. But the 
Galebs were taking a chance -- and they paid for it. 
  Had they flown a month ago, or at any time before the recent 
NATO ultimatum, it is quite possible that the Bosnian Serbs 
would have got away with it. The UN and those acting in its 
name have got tougher: if the Galebs' flight was designed to 
test this greater resolve, it secured a straightforward answer. 
Yesterday should also have seen the start of a more determined 
effort to get aid convoys past the blockades (mounted by 
combatants of all forces) which have so often forced them to 
grind to a halt. Instead the first convoy to travel under the 
new rules was halted by the UNHCR "until the system clarified." 
This is an early demonstration of an obvious truth -- often 
stressed by the aid workers themselves -- that being tough in 
one area can make life harder in another. There is no easy 
answer to this dilemma. 
  The Russian government (Mr Zhirinovskiy is another matter) 
appears to accept that if the Serb planes were engaged in 
offensive operations, then they were liable to UN sanction under 
a resolution which Moscow had fully endorsed. That does not 
diminish the political difficulty for the Russians if this leads 
to further incidents in which UN forces clash with the Serbs. A 
more forceful policy also has to steer very carefully between 
letting the Serbs off too easily and driving them into their 
preferred state of beleaguered martyrdom. It is essential too 
that the forces of the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims must be 
rigorously policed. 
  Incidents such as yesterday's Serb shelling of Tuzla present 
the UN with what may be a multiplying sequence of very difficult 
choices. It is unlikely to have been a direct riposte to the 
shooting down of the four planes. Tuzla, though one of the five 
UN safe-areas, has been shelled before with impunity, but it is 
also one of the issues over which the UN Commander intends to 
proceed more forcefully. Yet this is still a case to be tackled 
by negotiation rather than further retaliation. As it 
increasingly adopts the dual roles of peace keeping and peace 
making, the UN is going to encounter a widening patchwork of 
difficult and specific problems on the ground. They will need 
very sensitive handling: they cannot all be shot out of the sky.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Necessary Measures"] </F>
  [Text] In perfect accord with Resolution 816 of the United 
Nations Security Council, NATO aircraft yesterday shot down four 
Serb warplanes in the airspace over Central Bosnia. The 
warplanes had been responsible for an attack on a munitions 
factory, controlled by the Bosnian government, on the periphery 
of Novi Travnik, northwest of Sarajevo. NATO's response, 
uncharacteristically decisive, was entirely apt: Security 
Council resolutions ban flights by all "fixed-wing aircraft" in 
all Bosnian airspace. The prohibition, in force since March 
31,1993, is unequivocal: the Serbs cannot seek refuge in 
Jesuitical interpretations of text and word. 
  Also prohibited in clear terms are flights by "rotary-wing 
aircraft." Serb and Croat helicopters, however, have violated 
the ban with brazen frequency. The Croats, in particular, are 
known to have used these aerial means to ferry troops to combat 
zones. But what has been bitter sauce in Iraq for the goose has 
-- until now -- not been sauce for the gander in Bosnia. 
Helicopters have waltzed through Bosnian airspace, encountering 
nothing more than the occasional bolt of rhetorical NATO ire. 
Force has never been used against them, although it should have 
been on more than one occasion. 
  Yesterday's response to the first instance of breach of the 
"no-fly zone" by fixed-wing aircraft was reassuringly swift. It 
will have been the intention of the Serbs to test the waters -- 
or the air -- as regards such aircraft. They can be in no 
doubt, now, about NATO's new-found resolve: it has shown, albeit 
thoroughly tardily, that it will carry out the mandate handed to 
it by the Security Council, which authorised states, "acting 
nationally or through regional organisations" to take "all 
necessary measures" in Bosnian airspace to ensure compliance 
with the ban on overflight. As the Prime Minister, John Major, 
put it: "Frankly, they couldn't expect anything else." And the 
Russian reaction, while measured, has not been negative: it has 
accepted the legitimacy of NATO's action in shooting down the 
four warplanes, but has avoided a condemnation of the Serbs for 
their aggression. 
  NATO has used its teeth for the first time, qua NATO, since 
its formation in 1949. The significance of this will not be 
lost on the Bosnian Serbs. But apart from the particular issue 
of the enforcement of a Security Council resolution, its actions 
will serve as a more general warning to the Serbs: they cannot 
hope to switch with facility from Sarajevo to a different 
theatre of war. It is of the utmost importance that the Serbs, 
and the Croats, comprehend that NATO is intent on expanding 
zones of peace beyond Sarajevo. Mostar and Tuzla are next. 
  But a few hours after the NATO enforcement action, Bosnian 
Serb forces commenced heavy bombardment of the Muslim-controlled 
town of Tuzla, which they have besieged remorselessly for more 
than two years. But the Security Council has given them until 
March 7 to lift their siege of Tuzla airport. Yesterday's 
action by NATO must serve as a model for a response to any Serb 
failure to "unlock" that airport. NATO, at last, is no longer 
playing at war.

  [Text] Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday [2 
March] in the Federal Cabinet described the result of the entry 
negotiations in Brussels as a great success. According to 
government spokesman Dieter Vogel, the chancellor, with applause 
from the cabinet members, thanked Federal Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel and his staff for the great commitment they had displayed 
in the talks. 
  According to Kohl, the entry into the European Union of the 
new countries will go down as a major event in European history. 
The Federal Government has a vital interest in the fact that 
the group of member countries is now increased by Austria and 
the Scandinavian countries. The close cooperation between the 
FRG and the new member states will have a positive effect for 
Germany, in particular.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
assured Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross of the FRG's 
energetic support for Hungary's path toward the European Union 
[EU]. One precondition, however, is that the East European 
reformist state creates the necessary economic conditions for 
it, Kohl said on Tuesday [1 March] after a meeting with Boross 
in Bonn. In return, Germany is ready to provide help for 
self-help. The FRG is by far Hungary's most important trading 
partner, with an almost 30-percent share in exports and imports. 
In April, the federal chancellor is planning a visit to the 
Hungarian capital Budapest following an invitation by Boross. 
  Kohl once more pointed to the opening of Hungary's borders, 
which meant freedom for thousands of GDR [German Democratic 
Republic] citizens in the summer of 1989. This is a 
particularly important chapter in the long history of 
German-Hungarian relations that will never be forgotten, Kohl 
said. 
  Boross expressed his thanks for the FRG's readiness to help 
in the difficult process of political and economic 
transformation of his former socialist country. He emphasized 
Hungary's desire to become a full member in the European Union 
as well as NATO as soon as possible. He was optimistic that 
this would soon be the case as far as the OECD is concerned, 
Boross said. 
  During his one-day visit, Boross signed a German-Hungarian 
culture agreement. In the afternoon, talks were planned with 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany, and with representatives of the German economy.

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DPA) -- The Bundeswehr mission in Somalia 
has cost some 310 million German marks [DM], DM240 million of 
which will have to be paid by the German taxpayer, while DM70 
million will be refunded by the United Nations. Material worth 
DM60 million, including, for example, a field hospital and 
communications equipment, can be used in the future, too, and 
has, thus, to be regarded as "long-term investment." This was 
stated by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU], in Bonn on Monday [28 February]. The 
budget funds used by the Bundeswehr in Somalia are an 
"investment in humanitarianism and the future of the 
Bundeswehr," the minister stressed. 
  According to Ruehe, the mission of the German Armed Forces 
within the framework of the United Nations saved tens of 
thousands of people from sure starvation and illness. "The 
commitment of our soldiers was an act of humanitarianism, which, 
due to the special conditions in Somalia, could only have been 
provided by soldiers," Ruehe said. The funds used for it are 
"an investment in humanitarianism." 
  The largest single amount (DM102 million) of the almost 
10-month mission of a total of approximately 3,000 German blue 
helmets, which started in May 1993, went to transportation. Of 
that, a total of DM48.5 million was spent on civilian transport, 
above all charter flights. The military transports cost DM53.5 
million. [passage omitted] 
  According to a paper issued by the Defense Ministry, the 
United Nations already last year transferred DM13.4 million of 
the total refund of DM70 million.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The Public Sector, 
Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union (OeTV) on Tuesday [1 
March] concluded its warning strikes, which were limited to two 
days. As the OeTV headquarters in Stuttgart announced on 
Tuesday, more than 180,000 OeTV members in western and eastern 
Germany participated in the actions on Monday and Tuesday and 
"opposed the wage break planned by the employers." On Tuesday 
alone, 120,000 OeTV members all over Germany were on strike. 
  An OeTV spokesman said in Stuttgart that OeTV sees the 
warning strikes as a "clear signal" addressed to the employers 
to "finally start moving" in the fourth round of negotiations on 
9-10 March. The employers have so far not made any offer in 
response to the OeTV's 4-percent demand, but insisted on a "wage 
break" and presented their own "list of cancellations." 
  Local traffic companies in Berlin, Hannover, Dresden, 
Kassel, 
and Munich on Tuesday were, among others, included in the 
warning strikes. In Berlin alone, 50,000 OeTV members 
reportedly participated in the strikes. In another 25 cities in 
western and eastern Germany, traffic came to a temporary 
standstill. Employees of kindergartens and hospitals also held 
warning strikes on Tuesday, OeTV said.

  [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- Klaus Murmann, president of the 
Federation of German Employers' Associations (BDA), expects an 
increase in the number of unemployed to 4.5 million this year. 
Murmann told the Cologne daily EXPRESS (Wednesday edition): 
"The number of unemployed may certainly rise once again by up 
to 500,000 to 4.5 million this year; in eastern Germany, 
however, the low point has already been reached, in my view." 
  The decisive reason for the continuing shrinking is the 
still 
insufficiant demand for German products abroad and the weak 
demand in the country itself. The forecast by the Federal 
Government, which expects an economic growth of 3.5 to 4 
percent, is unrealistic, but 1.5 percent could be possible, the 
employers' federation president said. 
  Murmann was convinced that the situation would get worse if 
a 
government led by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
were to come to power. The BDA chief said: "From my talks with 
entrepreneurs, I know that the SPD is not trusted to be 
competent in economic policy." The economic situation in 
Germany would become even worse under an SPD-led government, 
Murmann predicted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article:"European Union: Enlargement a </F>
`Political Gesture' for Andreatta"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 2 Mar (ANSA) -- The marathon negotiating 
session, which concluded in Brussels last night with the 
enlargement of the European Union [EU] to include Sweden, 
Finland and Austria, delivered for Italy and for the Twelve, 
"successes and wounds" but was, above all, a political act that 
cannot help but have political consequences, according to 
Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta. 
  The contribution of these three new members will bring 
something new and different into the EU even as the nations 
making up the hard core of the Union search for a political 
initiative which remains the essential objective to be pursued, 
Andreatta said in commenting on the outcome last night of the 
enlargement talks. 
  Andreatta voiced satisfaction over the fact that the 
necessary compromises reached, especially in the agricultural 
sector, did not lead to any conservation of frontiers or of 
customs controls. The understandings with Austria with regard 
to road transit, while not leading to immediate liberalization, 
as hoped, nevertheless broke the bottlenecks in Italian traffic 
flow, he said. 
  However, for Andreatta, the most important aspect of EU 
enlargement (which could well be extended soon to Norway, as 
well) was the movement towards a truly European dimension for 
the Union which does not coincide merely with West Europe but 
which is heading for the shape and configuration imagined for it 
by thinkers back in the pre-World War period. 
  This enlargement is a political gesture, he said, because it 
should serve as a prelude to the inclusion in the Community of 
the former Communist states of East and Central Europe, whose 
participation in the continent's process of integration is today 
the biggest question facing the European Union, in his view. 
"If we do not manage to give European citizenship to the 
inhabitants of these countries, Europe will have lost one of 
those golden opportunities that history rarely offers," he said. 
  With these new members, Europe acquires a wealth of "diverse 
experiences, new men and new sensibilities," he went on. 
However, he saw as being necessary a political initiative on 
the part of a hard core of four or five nations which, due to 
their importance, should together forge a foreign policy. For 
this reason, a federal form within the center may be necessary, 
according to the diplomatic chief.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Somalia/Italy: Andreatta Meets </F>
Somali Salvation Democratic Front Leader"] 
  [Text] Rome, 23 Feb (ANSA) -- Foreign Minister Beniamino 
Andreatta on Wednesday [23 February] received the military 
leader of the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), Colonel 
Abdullahi Yusuf, to discuss developments in Somalia and the 
security of foreign development aid workers there, a communique 
announced. 
  Andreatta and Yusuf, said the communique, agreed on the need 
to support national reconciliation efforts and that warring 
Somali factions must be the ones to identify acceptable forms of 
future contacts. 
  Andreatta stressed that after Western contingents withdraw 
from Somalia, leaving fewer United Nations troops in the 
country, international aid efforts will be forced to be directed 
to more secure areas where "pacification is more advanced." He 
also warned that Italian aid will continue only if guarantees 
are given on the safety of Italians. 
  Yusuf reportedly assured Andreatta that the SSDF, of the 
northern Mijurtin clan and one of the two strongest military 
forces in Somalia, will provide these guarantees. 
  The ministry described the talks as cordial. They followed a 
tour by Italian Foreign Undersecretary Carmelo Azzara' in the 
Horn of Africa last week, when he also met Somali warlord 
General Aideed in Nairobi, Kenya. 
  Although the SSDF has been at war with Aideed's clan since 
the fall of dictator Mohammed Siad Barre in January 1991, Yusuf 
in May of last year began talks with Aideed, talks which were 
not officially sponsored by the political wing of the party, led 
by SSDF president Mohammed Abshir.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Hopes for New Premier Chosen </F>
From Parliament"] 
  [Text] Trieste, 26 Feb (ANSA) -- Prime Minister Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's first government chief who is neither a 
member of parliament nor a card-carrying party member, on 
Saturday [26 February] said he hoped the next government will be 
led by a member of parliament, as proof that the country's 
delicate moment of transition is past. 
  "I hope that the return of the prime minister's post to an 
elected member of parliament, considering the Italian tradition, 
will be seen as a positive sign for Italy, a signal that Italy 
is returning to normalcy and ending a critical phase," Ciampi 
said. 
  Ciampi, a former central bank governor, has been in a 
caretaker position ever since he tendered his resignation on 
January 13. He is not running in the March 27-28 elections and 
intends to withdraw from politics after his present government 
is sent home, presumably after the new parliament takes office 
on April 15. 
  "I was personally involved in this government because this 
transition was seen as best carried out by a non-parliament 
member," he said, referring to the decision by President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro to give Ciampi a mandate in April of last year. 
  Italy over the last two years has been caught up in 
burgeoning corruption scandals, which decimated the traditional 
parties, discredited many members of parliament and initiated 
widespread calls for voting and institutional reforms. A spate 
of car bombings in the spring and early summer of last year, 
combined with two rounds of local elections, deepening recession 
and the birth or mutation of many political parties, all added 
to growing political uncertainty.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mino Martinazzoli, secretary of the Italian </F>
Popular Party Secretary, by Alberto Statera; place and date not 
given: "Martinazzoli: A Constituent Government, Then"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Statera] Let us admit it, Mr. 
Martinazzoli: Your image is not a very smooth one and your 
language is not sufficiently basic. 
  [Martinazzoli] I am well acquainted with my face and I have 
no problem with it, even though it is not the Hollywood type. I 
certainly do nothing to make it smoother, because I refuse to 
show off, and I am irritated by stereotyped smiles and 
unnaturalness in politics. I will not disguise myself, because 
I am convinced that at least a little truth is fundamental in 
politics. 
  [Statera] But to go from that to the funereal.... 
  [Martinazzoli] I know, I am even said to be able to cast the 
evil eye and to lower audience ratings. But Funari [television 
presenter] for one does not think so. In any case, my face 
makes me the real leader of the neo-centrists, by virtue of all 
my skin blemishes... 
  [Statera] That is a good one... 
  [Martinazzoli] As for my language, the ultimate would be not 
to speak at all, since television encourages not thinking but 
watching. But since I do not expect an Oscar nomination, I 
reject this mystification. Politics needs words, not looks, 
teeth, and banalities. 
  [Statera] So will the centrists not make much use of 
television? 
  [Martinazzoli] Look, this is not just an anti-conformist 
option; it is also a financial necessity. The resources 
available to the right and the left are infinitely greater than 
ours. We will spend some 3-4 billion lire, and [Forza Italia 
leader Silvio] Berlusconi's right 10-15 times more. 
  [Statera] You mean 40 billion? 
  [Martinazzoli] More, more. An entrepreneur can throw his 
money around however he pleases. I admit that I do not know the 
anthropological profile of the Berlusconi man, but I must assume 
that he is not only a yuppie but must also be a supporter and in 
some instances also a volunteer, otherwise Berlusconi would go 
broke: How much must those strange 11,000 clubs cost him? Be 
that as it may, do not make me say that I want to disinvent 
television and its political product. It is not true: I am 
simply well aware of what Popper said, of the danger of the 
manipulation of consensus, the problem of freedom connected with 
the domination of the mass media. We need new ethics, for which 
even the foundations are lacking. 
  [Statera] Do you mean self-regulation for television? 
  [Martinazzoli] Self-regulation makes me laugh. For the first 
time Giuliano Ferrara is right, when he ridicules it. Moreover, 
I support Fede, who broadcast Berlusconi's first remarks. True, 
it took considerable faith [fede] -- pardon the pun -- to sit 
there and watch that program, but I did so and found it 
interesting, though I perceived some grim warnings in it. 
  [Statera] Of what? 
  [Martinazzoli] Though, of course, Berlusconi is not the 
devil 
incarnate, unfortunately the idea of a charismatic, 
publicity-based, and plastic democracy is taking hold amid this 
desert. But politics extends beyond merely the home, health, 
and certain sacrosanct necessities: It is the complex 
relationship among all these things, which must not be 
oversimplified in order not to create false hopes. You cannot 
make handfuls of promises using arguments that do no hang 
together. 
  [Statera] You yourself said that the sublimation of 
television is to remain silent, simply to be seen.... 
  [Martinazzoli] Yes, but I am still convinced that the people 
are not simply an audience and that life is not entirely 
confined to television; indeed, life conflicts with its 
televised image. Face powder is not everything; I hope that 
arguments still count for something. Some American friends 
agree with me in this: When they heard that in our 
constituencies some 35,000 votes are needed in order to be 
elected, they told me: "In that case you can meet with the 
voters individually and promise something to each one." We are 
not relinquishing direct contact with the people and are thus 
exorcizing invisibility, which is a curse in politics: It is 
like betting on a lame horse. A moderate visibility, not a 
vulgar, spectacular one. Kafka said that if Ulysses had not put 
wax in his ears he would have died not from hearing from Sirens' 
song but from the silence. 
  [Statera] Do you refuse to answer reporters' questions 
because you fear banality? 
  [Martinazzoli] At one time we had Gorresio, but now 
authoritative opinion makers stay in their offices and write 
about things they know nothing about, and journalists have been 
taught only to report witticisms. I do not like to talk in 
witticisms. I hate appearing to be something that I am not: I 
am a lawyer from Brescia, precisely as your fellow journalist 
from Cuneo said, dismissively. But what more than witticisms 
can be produced by a politics that is now conducted with the 
abacus? 
  [Statera] Who now conducts politics with the abacus? 
  [Martinazzoli] When I visited Berlusconi around Christmas I 
told him: Look, if you use the arithmetical logic of the 
abacus, even the traditional mistrust of the Italian Social 
Movement [MSI] will cease to exist. I tried to explain to him 
that we have been part of Italian history since 1919: We saw 
Mussolini grow up and saw many Popular Party members go with 
him. But Sturzo and others went into exile instead -- an exile 
which De Gasperi then legitimized. You need to take the long 
view, I told him. He replied still using the abacus. If it is 
he who is that the Italians want, then let them have him, but 
they must know that the exile of politics will not benefit 
anyone. I am talking not about threats of dictatorship but 
about the disappearance of the very substance of democracy: The 
mere fact of appealing to a savior who makes all kind of 
promises means that democracy is losing its very meaning. We 
are in danger of becoming what Arbasino calls a Country Without. 
  [Statera] Without what? 
  [Martinazzoli] Without history, without any authoritative 
voices. People talk about a country reduced to rubble, but that 
is nonsense recounted by people with bad memories: It is 
nonsense to say that everything that existed before the Second 
Republic should be rejected. This displays a shortcoming on the 
part of Italy's intellectuals: It is not clear whether they are 
more quick-change artists or conformists. This is a clumsily 
revolutionary period which some people have exploited. 
  [Statera] Who? 
  [Martinazzoli] What do you mean, who? Berlusconi -- who, if 
he deserves any credit, it is for having arrived at the right 
moment, when the whole scene was in disarray, to put forward a 
change with no sense of direction. 
  [Statera] Upstaging [Pact for Italy leader] Segni? 
  [Martinazzoli] Yes, with a kind of cheap trick. After the 
trouble over the lists, Segni must at least have realized that 
referendum movements are not politics and that you really cannot 
conduct politics without some kind of organization. In modern 
democracies parties are not redundant, as some maintain: We 
need to start drawing a distinction between corruptions and the 
value of parties that have been cured of them. That is, unless 
we want the leading role to be performed by television stations 
and mass media conglomerates, instead of politics itself. 
  [Statera] Pardon me, Mr. Martinazzoli, but do you not have 
the impression that while you are competing for seats in 
parliament, other centers of power are defining a new order for 
Italy? 
  [Martinazzoli] I certainly do have that impression: Several 
major vested interests think that they can do without the 
mediation of politics. The eclipse of politics also embodies a 
contest between economic potentates -- telecommunications, 
television, the banks, and so forth. We risk becoming subjects 
rather than agents, or watching the cake being sliced up among 
various businesses directly by their leading figures, one of 
whom, moreover, is also personally involved in politics. 
  [Statera] So is this invisible center becoming increasingly 
marginal? 
  [Martinazzoli] Keep in mind that we have two years of 
honorable conduct behind us, and I would like that to be 
acknowledged: We have supported the policies of [Prime 
Ministers] Amato and Ciampi, and indeed we have helped Ciampi 
more than anyone else, and I have had enough... 
  [Statera] Of what? Of Ciampi? 
  [Martinazzoli] No, I really have had enough of hearing 
[Democratic Party of the Left Secretary Achille] Occhetto 
portraying himself as a Quintino Sella [prefascist finance 
minister]. He is not. It is we who have supported this 
government, even though we recognized its political limitations. 
  [Statera] But do you think that this can be considered a 
merit by the Berlusconi man, by voters poisoned by rather stupid 
cliches? 
  [Martinazzoli] Many respectable things in this country were 
the outcome of minorities -- the Risorgimento, the Resistance... 
  [Statera] So you would not mind being in a minority? 
  [Martinazzoli] I do not like being in a minority at all; I 
have no vocation to be a martyr, but I am sure that politics is 
not like a restaurant, where the customer is always right. You 
engage in politics for the sake of you own personal ideas, and I 
am rather stubborn about mine. 
  [Statera] Very well, but Berlusconi enjoys a virtual 
monopoly 
of support, Occhetto has his own tough kernel.... 
  [Martinazzoli] Forget about the opinion polls. Let us talk 
about serious matters. Maybe one of the three blocs will win. 
If Berlusconi's wins, on the basis of the abacus, then it will 
govern. Otherwise, I see a gloomy future for that front. Can 
you not see that Bossi is muzzled and that his leading role has 
been undermined? If they win, perhaps they will succeed in 
staying together, otherwise.... 
  [Statera] What if Occhetto wins? 
  [Martinazzoli] More or less the same applies. 
Occhetto-Quintino Sella criticizes me from London -- he who is 
allied with the man who wants to tax government stock. How is 
it possible, either on the right or on the left, to accept 
alliances that exist solely for technical reasons? 
  [Statera] Very well, Mr. Martinazzoli, the centrists too 
might win, but let us consider the most likely hypothesis -- 
that none of the three alignments wins. 
  [Martinazzoli] I do not believe that if someone is sick he 
can be operated on every six months, so if that does happen I 
would try to salvage this legislature. 
  [Statera] How? 
  [Martinazzoli] Since we do not know how the new parliament 
will behave and we do not know how the seats will be 
distributed, I have in mind not a second Ciampi government but a 
constituent government, which will tackle the mass of 
constitutional problems. 
  [Statera] Do you mean that you are resisting the rule of 
alternation to the bitter end? 
  [Martinazzoli] Not at all; we want alternation, but not 
fictitious alternation or, worse, something that is not 
alternation but the splitting up of the country. 
  [Statera] What exactly would this constituent government 
have 
to do? 
  [Martinazzoli] Complete an electoral reform that is anything 
but complete, establish a forum for the debate on the specter of 
federalism, provide a guarantee that constitutional amendments 
will not entail sudden violent wrenches or excesses but will 
take place possibly by means of a number of referendums -- not 
only on abrogation but also to indicate preferences. 
  [Statera] A new form of associationism? 
  [Martinazzoli] No, I repeat: Whoever wins will govern. And 
I also repeat that we will not merge with the left, as many 
suspect. But if nobody wins, the patient must not be killed. 
There must be a constituent forum that will take the place of 
the assembly elected directly by the people, which I myself, 
Cossiga, and Miglio had in mind. And this forum could be 
precisely a constituent government. 
  [Statera] What would its purpose be? 
  [Martinazzoli] There are several differences within the 
Pact: 
I am not in favor of the direct election of the prime minister, 
which is what Segni wants. I have in mind, rather, a 
German-style system with a chancellor. 
  [Statera] What will your own role be? 
  [Martinazzoli] I would like to think that I have helped to 
prevent a disintegration, and on that basis, to take my leave. 
  [Statera] Thus regaining true invisibility? 
  [Martinazzoli] Look, we may be somewhat invisible, but we do 
have a core of popular support that those people with all that 
face powder and make-up can only dream of. 
  [Statera] Are you pledging that there will be no television 
appearances between now and 27 March? 
  [Martinazzoli] Since nobody is giving us any free 
half-hours... Be that as it may, you can be sure that you will 
not be seeing me on "Il Rosso e il Nero," [The Red and the 
Black] where opium and various other drugs are consumed -- 
ideological ones, of course.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Six More Italians in European </F>
Parliament"] 
  [Text] Rome, 1 Mar (ANSA) -- The number of Italian 
representatives in the European Parliament has been upped from 
81 to 87 deputies thanks to an Italian law decree, which also 
ushered in changes in election rules. 
  The law decree, which was approved by the cabinet February 
21 
but was only just published in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE, called for 
six additional Italian members in the Strasbourg Assembly in 
line with a decision taken by the European Council on February 
1, 1993. 
  The decree also ruled that political groups already present 
in the Italian Parliament and in the Strasbourg Assembly must 
collect signatures for the presentation of candidates in the 
European Parliamentary elections scheduled for June. 
  Previously, groups already present in parliament were 
exempted from having to gather signatures. Now, whoever wants 
to be a candidate in all five of the Italian constituencies set 
up for the European Parliamentary elections must collect between 
150,000 and 175,000 signatures. Furthermore, in each of these 
mega-constituencies, candidates must have at least between 
30,000 and 35,000 signatures. Slates will not be accepted in 
certain regions if the signatures gathered do not add up to at 
least one-tenth of the total of signatures collected in a 
particular constituency. 
  There are also changes affecting non-Italian community 
citizens resident in Italy. They can now be included in Italian 
voter lists and cast their ballots for Italian candidates and 
slates in their place of residence. The only formality required 
is that they file a request to do so with their local mayor up 
to 90 days prior to elections. 
  The same option is open to Italians residing in another 
European Community country, in line with EU directives. 
However, those Italians who do no want to vote for foreign 
parties, can cast their ballots in special polling stations that 
will be set up in Italian consulate offices, cultural 
institutes, schools, and the like. Even Italians who are not 
resident abroad, but who find themselves temporarily in another 
EU nation for work or study purposes, can vote in these 
specially set-up polling stations. 
  The decree also allows the presentation in Italy of 
candidates from other European Union countries -- as long as the 
EU citizen has not lost the right to run in elections in his 
native country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Forza Italia Out of the Running in </F>
Puglia"] 
  [Text] Rome -- A heavy blow for Silvio Berlusconi: the 
non-acceptance of Forza Italia's lists in Umbria and at Nuoro 
(for the Senate) and in Puglia (for the proportional quota for 
the lower house) was confirmed by the electoral office of the 
Court of Cassation. Among the best-known personalities excluded 
are Vittorio Sgarbi, who will however be standing in two other 
constituencies, and Berlusconi's spokesman Antonio Tajani. 
Berlusconi has expressed his "great displeasure" at being 
turned down in Puglia (where he had good hopes), also because, 
he admits, "this is due to our technical mistake." But at the 
same time Segni's Pact, already drastically reduced in number, 
is leaving illustrious victims on the field: In Turin his list 
will be unable to participate in the proportional vote for the 
lower house, and for this reason will not include former mayor 
Giovanna Cattaneo Incisa and Anselmo Zanalda, who was 
responsible for the reform of the Popular Party. Also out of 
the running, in the race for the Senate, is the "League for 
Piedmont" formed from Northern League dissidents. The Communist 
Renewal also had reason to be displeased: In Eastern Sicily the 
list headed by Secretary Fausto Bertinotti will not compete for 
the proportional vote (though Bertinotti himself is also 
standing in Rome and Turin). In the meantime the League is 
announcing an appeal to the regional administrative tribunal to 
have the elections suspended because its appeal against Lazio's 
exclusion from the list has been rejected, in its view, "without 
motivation." 
  Forza Italia's failure in Umbria is due to a delay in 
informing the Interior Ministry of the substitution of one of 
the persons appointed to file the list with the Court of Appeal. 
Bitter, because they were convinced they would be readmitted, 
are the five excluded candidates: Paolo Cicchini, Sergio 
Filipponi, Lanfranco Rosati, Torquato Terracina, and Francesco 
Trio. In Puglia, the Forza Italia list was excluded because 
more than 750 signatures were reported on "irregular" forms, 
that is on paper on which the National Alliance heading had been 
struck out by pen and replaced by Forza Italia. In vain, 
Berlusconi's representative produced new documents which are in 
order: the Court of Appeal stated that "new documents" had to 
be "of a clarifying or corrective" nature and not substituting 
those judged invalid. 
  Sgarbi took the decision philosophically; "the only thing 
which displeases me is that I will be unable to visit the 
splendid monuments in Puglia, and then I am a fatalist, and 
hence I do not hide a little bit of relief." Tajani, too, does 
not make a drama out of this: "This means that I will carry out 
better my job as Berlusconi's spokesman," he observed. On the 
other hand, Nicola Colaianni, PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
deputy and author of the anti-Forza Italia statement, was 
delighted: "I was sure," she declared, "because the fraud was 
obvious. There were two witnesses ready to confirm that the 
signatures had been obtained by the National Alliance and that 
the correction had been made afterwards. Moreover, this 
demonstrates that the electoral campaign does not live on 
advertising spots alone." 
  On the other hand, Berlusconi's list has been readmitted in 
the Marches, for the uninominal constituencies for the lower 
house, though candidates must all present themselves under the 
Forza Italia symbol, whereas candidates from the CCD [Christian 
Democratic Center], the Sgarbi for Italy list, and from the UDC 
[Center Union] all disappear. Other persons back again in the 
lists, apart from Sgarbi (who is also present in Calabria), are 
neurologist and political commentator Antonio Guidi (a frequent 
host of the Funari broadcasts of Berlusconi's TV programs), 
former CNR [National Research Council] Chairman Luigi Rossi 
Bernardi, and industrialist Stefano Clementoni, known as the 
"puppet king." In the Marches, on the other hand, appeals were 
rejected from the three League members Paolini, Tirabassi, and 
Savarese, as well as from Sassaroli (Pannella list) and Giausa 
(Communist Renewal). 
  In Trentino Alto Adige four appeals were rejected, and one 
only accepted, that of the ADA (Autonomous Democratic 
Aggregation), which had presented too many signatures. The 
Court of Cassation wisely considered that the decree 
substantially reducing the number of signatures had been 
introduced to make life easier for those presenting candidates, 
and therefore related only to the minimum number. Which is 
probably also why seven out of the eight lists which failed to 
make it in Veneto 2 have been reinstated: League, Forza Italia, 
PSI [Italian Socialist Party], PPI [Italian Popular Party], the 
Communist Renewal, the Autonomous League, and the Pannella List, 
whereas the Rete, which had few signatures, has remained outside. 
  In Trentino, on the other hand, appeals by the progressives 
and the AD [Democratic Alliance] were rejected. For the 
Democratic Alliance, Marina Salamon has not been allowed onto 
the proportional list (too few signatures). Nor has progressive 
Maurizio Zeni, whose certificate of registration in the 
electoral list arrived too late. Rejected, too, were the appeals 
by the Pannella List and the liberal nationalists of the Freedom 
Party [Freiheitliche], as their signatures were presented after 
the deadline. All the appeals coming from Sardinia were 
rejected.

<F P=106> [Alberto Venturini commentary: "Warrior's Haste"] </F>
  [Text] If [French 19th century politician] Talleyrand too 
could witness the tragic situation in Bosnia, he would perhaps 
repeat that war is too serious a thing to be left to the 
military. It should be added right away, however, that the 
military was simply doing its job in the skies above Banja Luka 
yesterday: The intercepted aircraft were returning from an 
offensive mission in violation of the UN resolutions; air 
patrols had been in operation above Bosnia for many months 
within the context of Operation Deny Flight; before firing their 
missiles the American pilots observed all the rules of 
engagement, including a double warning. 
  But precisely because the attack did faithfully follow 
established procedures, precisely because its official 
legitimacy is beyond question, this sudden baptism of fire for 
NATO 45 years after its foundation raises an issue which it is 
not for the military to resolve: Is it right, is it opportune, 
at this time of a delicate search for peace in Bosnia, for the 
alliance's air forces to open fire on the basis of an automatic 
decision entirely independent of any ratification in terms of 
political will? 
  According to news reports, NATO's decisionmaking chain 
worked 
well. But Bill Clinton heard about the incident after the 
event, it does not seem that any of the allied governments were 
consulted before the patrolling "top guns" were given the 
go-ahead, and even the blue helmets' commander, General Rose, 
was informed after the event. 
  In normal operational conditions, all this would be 
obligatory: When the military is backed up by a political 
decision (in our case the UN resolution), its duty is solely to 
be rapid and effective in implementing it. But the point is 
that in Bosnia today the operational conditions are not normal. 
  For the past few days a precarious truce achieved by means 
of 
the deterrent force of the allied ultimatum has been in force in 
Sarajevo. An attempt is being made to extend the same 
peace-making formula to other tormented cities. There is an 
approximate date for the reopening of Tuzla airport, which is 
indispensable for the distribution of aid. Crucial negotiations 
are under way in Washington between Muslims and Croats. Despite 
the controversies, it is hoped that the Russians will bring 
sufficient pressure to bear on the Serbian side, and Boris 
Yeltsin's difficult domestic situation must not be forgotten. 
  After two years of failures, the past few weeks have offered 
the peace-makers some timid grounds for hope, leaving a weak 
glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. So is this really 
the most suitable time to give free rein to the automatic 
intransigence of a military force? Should priority not be 
given, rather, to political assessment, especially in the 
Balkans, which have always been a source of provocation, and 
especially at a stage of the war that grants scope for the 
strategy of sabotage and that threatens to drag the Atlantic 
Alliance into an escalation with no way out? 
  It may be replied -- as the Western governments, and to some 
extent even Russia, did yesterday -- that in order to avert the 
punishment it would have been enough to observe the rules. 
That, sooner or later, after hundreds of unpunished violations, 
Deny Flight had to bang its fist on the table. That yesterday's 
attack is the result of the weakness of the past two years, that 
it stems from the need for NATO to enhance its credibility 
precisely in order to increase the effectiveness of the pressure 
to negotiate begun with the 21 February ultimatum. 
  It would certainly be disastrous -- and not only for peace 
in 
Bosnia -- if NATO were to return to the policy of empty threats, 
of words not matched by deeds. This cannot be the way to go. 
But in a situation of absolute military predominance, who could 
prevent the alliance from taking time to analyze and assess the 
situation and then if necessary from issuing a strike virtually 
with no threat of response? Faced with the incursion by the 
Serbs' jalopies, would it not have been possible yesterday to 
await a political ratification and then perhaps to destroy all 
the fighter bombers on the ground at Banja Luka as a punishment? 
NATO's credibility would certainly not have been diminished. 
  In Bosnia there are already the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims 
who live permanently with their fingers on the trigger. We must 
not imitate them if we want to escape their logic of death.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade, UIC Reports 11 Trillion </F>
Surplus in 1993"] 
  [Text] Rome, 25 Feb (ANSA) -- Italy posted a 10.979 
trillion lire trade-related exchange surplus in 1993, after 
registering a 15.866 trillion deficit in 1992, reported the 
Italian Exchange Office, UIC. In the month of December alone, 
Italy's surplus reached 2.421 trillion lire, exchange 
authorities added. 
  The figures are based on that office's records of all 
trade-related currency exchange operations exceeding 20 million 
lire in value. They do not correspond exactly to trade balance 
figures reported by the National Institute of Statistics Istat, 
which records goods and services crossing the border. 
  According to UIC's records, Italy's trade revenues last 
year totaled 219.413 trillion lire, as against payments of 
208.434 trillion. In the month of December, the outgoing total 
was 21.447 trillion (15.3 percent) while the incoming was 19.026 
trillion lire (1.9 percent). 
  Machinery and transport were the sectors showing greatest 
improvement over last year. Exchange balances with Germany and 
the United States improved most in 1993. 
  The following table outlines Italy's trade balance with 
other 
European and non-EU countries, based on UIC's exchange records.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Allegations Against Former Communist </F>
Party-Democratic Party of the Left Studied"] 
  [Text] Milan, 1 Mar (ANSA) -- Eight investigating 
magistrates from Milan, Rome, Turin and Venice met here today to 
coordinate investigations into allegations of wrongdoing 
levelled against the Italian Communist Party and, after February 
1991, the Democratic Party of the Left by ex-Socialist Party 
Secretary Bettino Craxi. 
  Milan assistant public prosecutor Gerardo D'Ambrosio said 
the 
forty-page affidavit Craxi delivered to the Rome public 
prosecutor's office in early February "is, for the most part, a 
collection of pieces of records gathered during the Milan 
investigations. This is a collage which, in some areas, is even 
wrong," he added and cited statements attributed to the wrong 
person as an example. 
  The magistrate from Milan's Clean Hands team also reported, 
"This is a technical meeting to avoid an overlap of 
investigations of the same case. On the 13 points indicated in 
Craxi's affidavit, only five concern investigations which have 
not been opened in Milan." D'Ambrosio said jurisdiction "is not 
a matter of opinion and certainly is not based on the place in 
which the affidavit was submitted." He went on to note that the 
name of the administrative secretary of the Democratic Party of 
the Left, and of the Communist Party before the name-change, 
Senator Marcello Stefanini, and those of others have been added 
to the log kept by the Rome public prosecutor's office listing 
persons under investigation. "But if it turns out that 
investigations of these facts have already been opened 
elsewhere, jurisdiction will clearly belong to the magistrates 
already at work on these cases," he added. 
  The Milan judge then explained the five accusations not yet 
covered in more than two years of Milan political and business 
corruption investigations. The first, he said, is the "Rotiroti 
affair, on which Rome is already moving for libel." This case 
centers on Craxi's allegation of bribery to the tune of 600 
million lire (356,000 dollars) surrounding real estate 
transactions in the Bufalotta area on the outskirts of Rome. 
The ex-Socialist leader named Primo Greganti, a former Italian 
Communist Party official in Turin, and Stefanini. 
  Rome investigating magistrates Adelchi D'Ippolito and Gloria 
Attanasio, who found that the allegations could not be 
substantiated, questioned Craxi on February 18 with an eye to a 
possible libel charge against him and his source, an 
ex-administrative secretary for Craxi's party in Rome, Raffaele 
Rotiroti. In the meantime, Stefanini and Greganti have filed 
their own libel suits against their accuser. 
  Another case among the five is alleged financing for the old 
Italian Communist Party from the secret police of the Soviet 
Union of the time, the KGB, and another is alleged ties between 
Naples crime boss Carmine Alfieri, in prison since September 
1992, and cooperatives of the left. 
  The assistant public prosecutor said Rome magistrates would 
presumably handle the end involving alleged kickbacks and Naples 
would be responsible for issues concerning the Camorra. These 
allegations are apparently based on testimony provided by 
Pasquale Galasso, a Camorra gangland figure who has turned state 
witness. 
  Another accusation made by Craxi concerns exports of 
Sicilian 
wine to the Soviet Union of the time and another is that of 
placing a man on the board of a social services institute run by 
the Treasury. 
  Turin magistrate Giuseppe Ferrando said he had travelled to 
Milan to meet the people he would be dealing with "because we in 
Turin were first in contact with Tiziana Parenti," the 
magistrate who abandoned the Clean Hands team last year in a 
dispute over her insistence on pursuing the investigation of the 
Democratic Party of the Left administrative secretary. She is 
now on a leave of absence to run for parliament in the March 27 
elections on a rightist Forza Italia slate. 
  Carlo Nordio from Venice said he intended to continue his 
investigation into possible Democratic Party of the Left misuse 
of 40 billion lire (23.74 million dollars) received by 
parliamentary aides. Over the past five years, the 
parliamentary aides attached to the MPs of all the parties 
represented have between 150 and 160 billion lire (up to 95 
million dollars). Investigators suspect that some of the funds 
going to those for the Democratic Party of the Left may have 
wound up with the local party sections. 
  A Rome assistant public prosecutor, Gianfranco Mantelli, 
said 
the investigations under study go beyond the 13 cases cited by 
Craxi in his affidavit. 
  Asked by reporters about the prospect of a slowdown in the 
investigations in the run-up to the vote at the end of the 
month, D'Ambrosio said, "Don't even dream of it. We're not 
thinking like this at all." He also emphasized that the meeting 
held today was aimed merely at a better coordination of the 
investigations in course.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Top Camorra Boss Decides To </F>
Collaborate"] 
  [Text] Naples, 1 Mar (ANSA) -- Carmine Alfieri, considered 
the head of the most powerful clan within the Camorra, the 
organized crime network in the southern Campania region, has 
decided to collaborate with authorities and turn state's 
evidence, judicial sources have confirmed. 
  Public television Monday evening [28 February] announced 
that 
Alfieri, who is believed to hold the key to the hidden 
connections between organized crime and politicians, had begun 
to provide information to investigators three weeks ago. 
Judicial sources at the Naples court later confirmed the report. 
  Alfieri, reputedly the richest of Camorra bosses, was 
arrested in September 1992 following accusations made by another 
boss turned informer, Pasquale Galasso, who accused Alfieri of 
involvement in several gang murders. 
  Perhaps most importantly, investigators hope Alfieri may 
shed 
light on collusions between his own clan and prominent political 
figures, public administrators and magistrates, connections 
alleged by Galasso in previous testimony. 
  Alfieri is reportedly being questioned at an undisclosed 
location. He is also suspected of involvement in money 
laundering and extortion. 
  The sources stressed that there was no link between 
Alfieri's 
decision to talk and the announcement made last month by the 
Bishop of Acerra, Antonio Riboldi, that hundreds of the clan's 
members were ready to turn themselves in. 
  He was arrested by police in September 1992 after 10 years 
in 
hiding. He was found guilty but then acquitted by an appeals 
court for the murder of eight people at Torre Annunziata, near 
Naples, in 1984.

<F P=106> [Hilary Barnes report: "Danish Coalition Loses Its Majority"] </F>
  [Text] Copenhagen -- Denmark's four-party centre-left 
coalition government yesterday lost its one-vote majority in the 
Folketing when a member of the Centre Democratic party resigned 
to sit as an independent for the rest of the current parliament. 
  The opposition is expected to try to exploit the change to 
force the government into calling an early election. However, 
the dissident Centre Democrat, Mrs Bente Juncker, has said that 
as long as the government sticks to the policy programme agreed 
when the government was formed in January last year she would 
not help to bring it down. 
  An election to the Folketing must be called by the prime 
minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic party 
leader, by December 6. Mr Rasmussen has repeatedly said that he 
will postpone calling an election as long as possible. 
  Mrs Juncker was appointed minister for social affairs, 
replacing a Social Democratic minister, in a cabinet reshuffle 
on January 27. The reshuffle was intended to strengthen the 
government in general and the Centre Democrats in particular in 
the run-up to the election but it went badly wrong. 
  Two weeks after the reshuffle Mrs Juncker was dismissed for 
passing on libellous rumours to journalists concerning the head 
of a home for mentally retarded adults. 
  Recent opinion polls suggest that the government -- made up 
of the Social Democrats, the Centre Democrats, the Christian 
People's party and the Radical Liberals -- will lose seats in an 
election. There is a risk that the Centre Democrats, with nine 
seats, and the Christian People's party, with four seats, will 
be eliminated from the Folketing altogether. 
  If an election result were to follow the opinion polls, Mr 
Rasmussen would continue to have a good chance of forming a 
minority administration, but he would have to rely on the 
support of the left-wing Socialist People's party.

  [Text] Following the punishment inflicted on the Serbs we 
have seen an increase in NATO's credibility: This is the view of 
NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, who was interviewed by 
RAIDUE news correspondent, Francesco Mattioli. 
  [Mattioli] A clear-skies policy over Bosnia has been in 
force 
for months and it has been violated hundreds of times, why has 
NATO decided to react right now? 
  [Woerner] It has not been violated -- as you say -- hundreds 
of times. This is the first violation by jets. We tolerated 
violations of the policy by helicopters because from a military 
point of view they were not significant. These were 
jet-fighters and furthermore our pilots saw them bomb targets on 
the ground. 
  [Mattioli] This was the first military engagement for a 
military alliance that has existed for 45 years, how do you feel? 
  [Woerner] Of course it is always preferable to avoid using 
force. In general we want to achieve our objectives without 
using force. However, we cannot tolerate violations of UN 
decisions using force, and so we went from words to actions. We 
are determined and I believe we have given a basic lesson that 
means that now everyone must take NATO seriously. 
  [Mattioli] Do you not fear that the war will be extended? 
  [Woerner] No, not at all, in fact it is more likely that the 
opposite will happen. I believe that in the future the no-fly 
zone will be respected.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brittan Discusses GATT and Trade in </F>
Beijing"] 
  [Text] The European Union (EU) has warned Beijing that any 
attempt to discriminate against British companies as a result of 
its dispute with London over Hong Kong would be totally 
unacceptable and would have serious consequences for relations 
between China and the Europe of Twelve. 
  In the Chinese capital on Monday [28 February], Sir Leon 
Brittan and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi co-chaired the 
13th meeting of the joint EU-China committee which is due to 
last two days and during which the main subject of discussion 
will be China's reentry to the GATT. Their first joint press 
conference held yesterday was marked by a quite sharp exchange 
on the Hong Kong question. Wu Yi, who judged Great Britain's 
attitude as "unfriendly and uncooperative," warned that it could 
not but affect the economic and trade relationship between the 
two countries. Brittan then stressed that relations between the 
EU and China were based on nondiscrimination with regard to EU 
member states. "Any discriminatory action against a member 
state for political reasons would be a very serious matter, not 
just for that member state but for the EU as a whole," he 
warned, without specifying what action could be taken. It does, 
however, seem clear that Europe's support for Chinese membership 
in GATT carries considerable weight. 
  China accuses the British governor of Hong Kong of seeking 
to 
introduce without its consent democratic reforms for the colony 
which is due to return to Chinese rule in 1997. 
  Apart from the matter of the British colony, the two parties 
displayed optimism, describing yesterday's working session as 
"frank and constructive." Brittan stated that Brussels was 
"full of admiration" for the efforts made by Beijing to move 
toward a market economy, even if differences remain on certain 
points. "There are problems to be solved as China's development 
is remarkable but incomplete," he said, adding that the 
conditions for reentry to GATT "must be negotiated in order to 
speed up the process of reform and liberalization." 
  Sir Leon also spoke of Europe's concern on the human rights 
issue, and submitted a draft protocol on European proposals with 
a view to settling outstanding questions, expressing the hope 
that "progress can be made in this field without delay." 
  For her part, Mrs Wu accepted that differences of opinion 
remained, stressing however that the two parties were determined 
to make the necessary efforts to resolve them. 
  According to one Western diplomat, the EU is worried by the 
fact that China may reach an agreement with the United States 
concerning its reentry to the GATT in return for trade 
concessions which would be detrimental to Europe.

<F P=106> [Statement by Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky in the </F>
Parliament in Vienna -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen; yesterday's 
conclusion of EU [European Union] membership talks has opened 
the door to the EU for Austria. Austria's way into a united 
Europe is as old as the entire Second Republic. This way led 
from the European Reconstruction Program, the Marshall Plan, to 
the establishment of EFTA [European Free Trade Association], 
from the association negotiations in the 1960's and the signing 
of the Free Trade Agreement by the first Kreisky government up 
to the European Economic Area that came into effect last year. 
All these efforts show that for Austria it has always been a 
fact that peace, stability, and prosperity can only be developed 
and maintained together with the other democracies in Europe. 
Let me stress the words together and democracies. The history 
of this century has shown it was democracies that did not wage 
wars against each other. Developments in the east and southeast 
of our continent since the collapse of communism have confirmed 
this attitude. The great challenges of our time can only be 
tackled by joint solutions. This is true for securing Austria 
as a business location, for safeguarding our social network, as 
well as for protecting our environment, for future-oriented 
transport and energy policies, and for participating in the next 
steps in research and development. If our country does not want 
to remain isolated in this situation, there is only one possible 
decision, namely a clear declaration in favor of integration and 
a declaration to participate actively in the dynamic development 
of the EU after joining. If we take part in this European 
dynamic and contribute our creativity, hard work, and experience 
to the European entity, then we will have a share in creating 
the great projects at the turn of the millennium and continue 
playing our historic role in the very heart of the continent. 
  I think that on this important and decisive day we must also 
state that these great projects in the world go beyond the 
horizons of the EU. Nothing should be further from our minds 
than Euro-centredness or the idea of an isolated fortress called 
European Union. These projects and the efforts they involve 
require the inclusion of the reform states in a joint area of 
stability, prosperity, and democracy, as well as the opening up 
to the dynamic new economic areas in East and Southeast Asia and 
in Latin America and the restructuring of our relations with the 
nations of the South. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, 50 years ago the survivors of two 
world 
wars set their hopes on a united Europe. Their aim was to have 
no more wars. And their way led to European integration. In 
this community, nations that had been at war for centuries were 
reconciled; and it secured for those nations that shed the 
burden of dictatorship their place in Europe. This made the EU 
the guarantor of peace and security for its members. Austria -- 
while keeping its neutrality -- has the opportunity to become a 
member of this peace community and to participate in its 
extension to form a framework of security including all of 
Europe. [applause] It has become unthinkable today that citizens 
of the EU fight wars against each other, shoot at each other. 
This makes the Community -- beside all economic, social, and 
ecological tasks -- a great peace project. Especially in view 
of all the uncertainties prevailing not far from our country, we 
will have a conscious share in this peace project and help form 
it. [applause] 
  It is fashionable to complain about the lack of grand 
concepts and visions in the sphere of politics. I would like to 
ask the following question: What, if not the peaceful 
unification of the continent where we are living, what, if not 
the growing together of the most different peoples and cultures, 
should be such a prospect, a task that is worth devotion. 
However, there are naturally also numerous practical reasons 
why the Austrian Government suggests to the Austrians that they 
should join the European Union, why the Austrian Government 
works to achieve this goal, and makes such a great effort. 
  I would like to make the following very clear today: In the 
past few days, weeks, and months, Austria explained, 
safeguarded, and ensured its interests with toughness, 
consistence, and determination. The negotiations have shown 
that we Austrians can join forces and cooperate if need be. 
[applause] 
  We can state with some satisfaction today that we will 
integrate in the European Union what is important for us 
Austrians, that we will enjoy the advantages, but that we will 
also assume the obligations that are linked with membership. I 
strongly hope and believe the tough negotiations that were 
occasionally observed critically by foreign and domestic 
newspapers will turn into respect for Austria in the long run. 
[applause] 
  It is also important at this point for us to say that, in 
view of our commitment and our intention to participate in an 
open Europe, in a market without frontiers, this opens up 
numerous opportunities for our producers and consumers, but it 
naturally also represents new challenges, and it will be 
necessary to adapt as a result of the opening of the market. 
Measures are required to make it possible for those who would 
otherwise be facing difficulties to adapt to the new situation. 
I would like to stress that these changes are necessary whether 
we become members of the European Union or not. However, the 
market will be opened up in such a way that we can safeguard and 
expand our cultural and ecological interests. Austria will 
adhere to its own regulations, but it will also integrate them 
into a larger Europe, in cultural diversity. We will and want 
to preserve and expand our pioneering role as an exemplary 
welfare state and our pioneering role in the environmental 
sphere. 
  Above all, Austria, this small country at the heart of 
Europe 
comprising barely 8 million people and whose name [Oesterreich] 
is too long for the ordinary globes used in schools, this 
country will participate in a large market of 320 million which 
would be much more difficult to access without membership in the 
European Union. 
  The foreign minister has just mentioned the major points of 
the outcome of the talks in Brussels. Let me add one thing: 
Austria's social, environmental, and health standards will 
continue to be valid. Moreover, the European Union has for the 
first time in its history stipulated an ecological goal in an 
agreement. The foreign minister pointed this out. I would like 
to underline his statement about Austria's intention to stick to 
the ban of the use of nuclear energy and to continue its 
commitment to a nuclear-free Central Europe. 
  For the future economic and social development of our 
country the conclusion of the negotiations sets a substantially 
new course. The full participation in the large single European 
market as a partner with equal rights will permit Austria to use 
for our benefit all the advantages that this common Europe 
offers. At the same time, it eliminates the existing 
disadvantages of isolation and rules out the danger of future 
discrimination. In particular it guarantees that Austria will 
be able to continue to take advantage of being even more 
attractive as an economic center at the point where East meets 
West, which will have a positive impact on developments on the 
labor market. We will conduct a most intensive and enlightening 
discussion with those citizens who sometimes anxiously ask 
themselves why we are seeking membership in an economic area 
whose average unemployment rate is higher than that of Austria. 
These questions need to be answered -- we will provide the 
answers. 
  Existing export barriers will fall, cooperation agreements 
between companies will be essentially facilitated through the 
harmonization of taxes and a common trade policy. Thus, the 
significant competitive disadvantages for Austrian enterprises, 
which are the result of the complicated European regulations of 
origin, will disappear. The elimination of customs and border 
checks will not only cut billions in expenses on the part of the 
enterprises but will result in sizable price advantages for the 
consumers, particularly in the area of foods, beverages, and 
tobacco, and articles in daily use, which is why low-income 
earners, in particular, will benefit from these lower prices. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the citizens often ask us politicians: 
You always tell us about the advantages of our participation in 
European integration. There must also be disadvantages, which 
you must not conceal. We will not conceal them, and I would 
like to take this opportunity to mention one point, namely that 
there will be disadvantages, but that we will be able to 
eliminate them and cope with them. Regarding peoples' worries 
about a danger to the security of our country as a result of the 
elimination of border checks, that it is up to the Austrian 
Federal Government and, together with other governments through 
cooperation between interior ministries and security 
authorities, to provide other, new kinds of checks, so that the 
citizens' fears of the elimination of border checks can be 
dispelled. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, I would finally like to point to the 
considerable increase in prosperity that will follow from 
Austria's accession to the European Union, and which, according 
to provisional calculations by the Austrian Economic Research 
Institute, will amount to some 50 billions net for the next five 
years. This would constitute an additional economic growth of 2 
percent and create some 30,000 new jobs. The gradual 
implementation of economic and monetary union will lead to 
further income gains. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, this brings me back to my remark that 
the conclusion of the negotiations in Brussels has opened the 
door toward European Union. Whether, we will finally walk 
through this door will have to be determined by the Austrian 
people in a democratic decision. Until then a lot remains to be 
done. Many citizens of our country already have an opinion on 
the issue. Yet we also want to get the support of those 
citizens who still hesitate or who do not or not yet want to 
accompany us on the road to Europe. Therefore, we will have to 
lead a very open discussion. After all, the point is not to try 
to talk people into something but to convince people of a path 
that we regard as the better path for the future, and, by 
meeting our responsibility as the Austrian Government, we are 
convinced that we have to pursue this objective. Together with 
the other countries of the European Union, and probably also 
with the north European countries, this path should lead us into 
a common and peaceful European future. [applause]

<F P=106> ["SN, APA"-initialed report: "500 Joint Ventures With </F>
Poland; Austria Invests 1.5 Billion Schillings"] 
  [Text] Austrian enterprises have concluded some 500 joint 
ventures with Polish partners. The entire investment amounts to 
1.5 billion schillings, making Austria one of the most important 
investors in Poland. 
  The strongest Austrian commitment has been in the 
construction sector. Yet, Austria is also represented in the 
trade, consulting, and the banking sectors. "Austrian companies 
should invest more in Poland now," trade delegate Rudolf Orisich 
recommended at a seminar in Vienna. He emphasized that Poland 
could boast the best economic figures in East Europe. GDP has 
increased by 4.5 percent, industrial production by 7 percent, 
the agricultural sector by 1.5 percent, and private consumption 
by 9 percent (estimated figures for 1993). At the moment, some 
40 percent of the economy has been privatized, and a third of 
industry, 50 percent of foreign trade, and 90 percent of retail 
trade has been denationalized. 
  In 1993, Austrian exports decreased by 8.8 percent to 6.4 
billion schillings, while imports fell by 6.6 percent to 4.7 
billion schillings. The agreement between Poland and the 
European Free Trade Association is intended to stimulate 
relations.

<F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Labour today demanded clarification from Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd after a senior Russian arms industry 
official confessed to spying for Britain. 
  Official Russian news agency TASS said the man, who was not 
named, had been supplied with invisible writing materials and 
means of secretly supplying information to intelligence agents 
at the British Embassy in Moscow. 
  Embassy officials in Moscow and a spokesman for the Foreign 
Office in London had no comment on the report. 
  Labour frontbench foreign affairs spokesman with 
responsibility for intelligence matters, Allan Rogers -- 
referring to the arrest in the U.S. of a top CIA official last 
week on charges of spying for the Kremlin -- said: "There is a 
large element of tit-for-tat in these arrests and exposures. 
  "Russia has probably known about this man for a long time. 
We (Britain) are paying the price for the so-called special 
relationship with the United States. Russia sees us as wearing 
the same clothes." 
  He said Mr. Hurd should "clarify" the matter. 
  The information that the spy passed on contained facts about 
the latest Russian research into development of new weapons, as 
well as information about Russia's prospects of cooperation with 
other countries on defence projects, Interfax news agency said. 
  Bob Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford South, said: "This casts a 
little light on the murky world of spying. Worse still, it is 
connected with the even murkier world of international arms 
sales. 
  "This may well strain international relations with Russia, 
particularly since President Yeltsin is now losing his position 
in Russia and will be looking for external difficulties to 
divert attention from domestic crises." 
  News agency TASS reported: "On January 25 the detainee was 
charged with high treason in the form of espionage, which he 
admitted fully." 
  The agency quoted Russia's Federal Counterintelligence 
Agency 
as saying the man had been arrested on January 15. "On 
assignment for British intelligence for monetary reward, this 
Russian citizen collected and handed over information of a 
secret military and economic nature." 
  The arrest by the Federal Counterintelligence Agency came 
one 
day after President Boris Yeltsin sacked the agency's chief, 
Nikolay Golushko. 
  A presidential decree said that Golushko, who headed the 
successor organisation to the old communist KGB secret police 
since September, had been dismissed. 
  It gave no reason for the sacking. But TASS, quoting sources 
in the counterintelligence agency, cited the freeing of seven 
jailed opponents of Yeltsin from a prison under the agency's 
control last weekend. 
  A Downing Street spokesman refused to comment, saying: "You 
would not possibly expect me to comment on such a matter."

<F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F>
reporter] 
  [Text] Britain and the United States have launched an 
initiative to help rebuild war-torn Sarajevo, Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd told MPs today. 
  In a Commons statement, Mr Hurd said the initiative had been 
taken after talks between President Clinton and the Prime 
Minister, who is currently in the United States. 
  The aim was to "normalise" life in the city. 
  "A joint British-U.S. civil planning mission will be 
established to work with the Sarajevo City authorities, the EU 
[European Union] and the UN to assess the requirements for 
restoring public utilities in the city." 
  The move follows the lifting of the seige of Sarejevo after 
NATO forces threatened military intervention. 
  Mr Hurd was reporting on yesterday's incident in which four 
aircraft in breach of the no-fly zone were shot down by NATO 
planes. He said the action should leave the warring parties "in 
no doubt of our earnest in implementing decisions in Bosnia. 
We shall continue our active work with the international 
community on how to build on the progress in Sarajevo and reach 
a negotiated settlement." 
  The UN would be drawing up plans to assess the feasibility 
of 
breaking the seige of other cities and towns, including Mostar, 
Vitez and Maglaj. 
  "Reports are coming in from Moscow that the Bosnian Serb 
leader, Mr Karadzic, has reached agreement with the Russian 
foreign minister on how Tuzla airport might be reopened with 
Bosnian Serb consent. If confirmed this would be a welcome 
step."

<F P=106> [Article by George Jones, political editor: "Unionists Dash </F>
Major's Hopes of Ulster Peace"] 
  [Text] Government hopes of achieving a political 
settlement in Northern Ireland looked bleak last night after the 
Ulster Unionists refused to take part in talks involving Dublin. 
  Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said the 
Downing Street declaration, signed by Mr John Major, the Prime 
Minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, 11 
weeks ago, "had run its course." 
  His party, the main voice of the loyalists, said it would 
not 
engage in any new talks involving Dublin until an internal 
settlement, including a new devolved assembly for Ulster, had 
been reached. 
  The Unionists offered to continue to talk to the British 
Government and other mainstream parties in Northern Ireland. 
But Downing Street reaffirmed the Government's view that all 
those affected, including Dublin, had to be involved in talks on 
the province. 
  The Government sought to play down the rejection, 
emphasising 
that efforts to reach a settlement would continue. "We don't 
believe in the counsel of despair," said a spokesman. 
  "We recognise this is a difficult situation, but we will 
continue to talk to all the parties to try to find common 
ground." 
  The Downing Street declaration emphasised that progress 
would 
be made through the three-strand talks -- and not by a purely 
internal settlement. This was underlined by Mr Major and Mr 
Reynolds last month. 
  The hardline Democratic Unionist Party led by Mr Ian Paisley 
is already boycotting talks. But the official Unionists' 
decision is a much more serious blow. 
  It was the second setback for the Government in 24 hours. 
Over the weekend it became clear at Sinn Fein's annual 
conference in Dublin that the IRA is not yet prepared to declare 
a ceasefire, raising doubts over the effectiveness of the 
Downing Street declaration. Ministers believe that the new 
hardline position by the Ulster Unionists is dictated largely by 
the approaching European elections. The party fears it could be 
outflanked by Mr Paisley' s more extreme Democratic Unionists. 
  Unveiling the Ulster Unionists' Blueprint for Stability, 
which includes a demand for a new Bill of Rights as well as a 
devolved assembly, Mr Molyneaux scorned the "summitry" by the 
two prime ministers. 
  Two initiatives were now needed, he said: "a genuine effort 
to eradicate terrorism" and moves towards "restoring democracy." 
  Speaking at a Westminster news conference, Mr Molyneaux 
said: 
"The failure of the declaration has also hideously damaged the 
Anglo-Irish Agreement. Things are never going to be the same 
again."

<F P=106> [Article by George Jones and Colin Randall: "Ulster Peace </F>
Hope Fades as Sinn Fein Fails To Deliver"] 
  [Text] Even before yesterday's announcement by the Ulster 
Unionists that they would not take part in Ulster peace talks 
involving Dublin, the early promise of the Downing Street 
Declaration had faded. 
  Eleven weeks ago, on Dec 15, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish 
Prime Minister, stood shoulder by shoulder with Mr Major outside 
No 10 and said there was now an "historic opportunity" for 
peace. Mr Major said it "opened the doors" to those who 
abandoned violence. 
  But Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Provisional IRA has 
so far refused to take up their invitation to "turn the key in 
the lock." 
  Initially, Mr Major showed considerable irritation with Sinn 
Fein's reluctance to respond. Early in January, he branded its 
demand for "clarification" as a desperate delaying tactic. The 
word in Whitehall was that Sinn Fein would have a month to 
accept the document or face a tough security clamp-down. That 
deadline -- never publicly acknowledged by the Government -- 
came and went. 
  The Americans then tried. President Clinton agreed to waive 
the ban on Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, entering the 
United States last month, because the powerful Irish-American 
lobby persuaded him that Mr Adams would use the visit to back 
the declaration. Mr Adams, however, milked the visit for 
considerable publicity but carefully avoided giving any 
commitments. 
  Attention switched to Sinn Fein's annual conference in 
Dublin 
last weekend. It was described as a "watershed" -- the defining 
moment for the republican movement. 
  Ministers hinted that failure by the conference's delegates 
to support the declaration would be seen as tantamount to 
rejection -- a clear signal that the IRA and Sinn Fein were not 
prepared to abandon violence. But Sinn Fein, while softening 
its criticism of the peace initiative, set further conditions 
for a suspension of IRA operations. 
  There are plenty of pessimists in Whitehall and Westminster 
ready to say "I told you so." They say that Sinn Fein was never 
really interested in peace and has used the process to raise its 
profile and secure important concessions, including the lifting 
of the broadcasting ban in the Republic and the international 
media blitz in New York. 
  The Government has also had to soften its previous firm 
stance on refusing to clarify the declaration. Last week, in 
the run-up to the Sinn Fein conference, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the 
Northern Ireland Secretary, and Mr Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, 
made speeches clearly aimed at clarifying the small print of the 
document, reaffirming that the British Government would not seek 
to impede the "exercise of self-determination" -- North and 
South. 
  Mr Major used an article in the Irish News, Northern 
Ireland's leading nationalist newspaper, to spell out how Sinn 
Fein could enter political talks. 
  Yet the 11 weeks since the two Prime Ministers stood outside 
No. 10 have seen the most intense period of political activity 
in Northern Ireland for years. The optimists in Government 
argue that Sinn Fein is being gradually drawn into mainstream 
politics and is raising expectations of peace which may make it 
difficult for the IRA to return to the previous level of 
violence. 
  As always with Ulster politics, any progress is 
infuriatingly 
slow -- and there is now an acknowledgement that it could take 
months -- even years -- before Sinn Fein and the army council of 
the IRA are prepared to back the declaration. Both Downing 
Street and the Northern Ireland Office stress that it remains on 
the table and will not be withdrawn. Even without a positive 
Sinn Fein response the joint declaration remains an important 
statement of principles agreed by the British and Irish 
Governments. "There never was any time limit. It did not have 
a sell-by sticker," said one official. 
  Some politicians most closely involved with Northern Ireland 
believe that that a new phase has opened up. 
  They argue that if events since Dec 15 are judged against 
the 
broad sweep of the Irish troubles, rather than from a short-term 
perspective, there has been considerable movement. The softer 
tone of remarks by some leading Sinn Fein figures at their 
Dublin conference reflects the party's limited welcome of what 
it says is a less confrontational approach from British 
ministers. It said it found recent speeches by Sir Patrick and 
Mr Hurd "intriguing." 
  At the weekend, the essentially uncompromising line taken 
by Mr Adams, was followed by a succession of less hostile 
contributions, most notably from Mr Martin McGuinness, 
vice-president, and Mr Mitchel McLaughlin Northern Irish 
chairman. 
  Yet the stumbling blocks seem as solid as ever. While Sinn 
Fein says it accepts that Protestants cannot be coerced into a 
united Ireland, it has not convincingly explained how this 
squares with its continuing demand for a British assurance that 
Unionists should have no veto. 
  Though the Irish government considers it has stuck more 
firmly to the letter and spirit of the declaration than Mr 
Major, it has shown itself increasingly ready to make gestures 
intended to bring Sinn Fein into the peace process. 
  Mr Reynolds has sought to maintain what he recognises is the 
crucial backing of his Fianna Fail party's republican 
traditionalists by accommodating Sinn Fein's demand for 
clarification in spite of London's contrary stand. 
  His interpretation of the joint statement, including an 
assertion that no one, including Unionists, had a veto on 
progress, was particularly welcome to Mr Adams and Mr 
McGuinness, who have gleefully exploited differences between the 
governments. 
  Republicans were also triumphant when Mr Reynolds's 
government lifted the 20-year ban on broadcasters interviewing 
Sinn Fein activists and para-militaries a move condemned by 
Unionists as "grovelling to the gunmen." 
  The Taoiseach's [Irish prime minister] comment that the 
future of terrorist prisoners would be considered in the 
negotiations after a permanent end to violence was also seen as 
a distinctly unhelpful concession. 
  Critics of the Dublin approach point out that the promise of 
more stringent security should Sinn Fein and the IRA reject the 
initiative sits uneasily with the actions of the Dublin court 
that last Friday [26 February] refused to extradite Joseph 
Magee, accused of murdering an Army sergeant in Derby.

<F P=106> [Sean O'Neill and George Jones report: "Ministers Clash on </F>
Gagging Order"] 
  [Text] The future of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the Attorney 
General, was called into question last night by damaging 
evidence to the Scott inquiry by Mr Michael Heseltine the 
president of the Board of Trade. 
  Mr Heseltine told the hearings into the arms-to-lraq affair 
he feared attempts to withhold Whitehall papers from the Matrix 
Churchill trial would create the impression of a Government 
cover-up. 
  Mr Heseltine said he had refused to sign a public interest 
immunity PII certificate -- a so-called gagging order -- until 
ordered to by Sir Nicholas, the Government's senior law officer. 
  Mr Heseltine complained of receiving "incredible" advice 
from 
Government lawyers, including Sir Nicholas, on keeping documents 
from the courts. And despite assurances from the Attorney 
General his reservations about withholding the papers were not 
made known to the trial judge. Faced with the PII certificate, 
Mr Heseltine insisted on significant amendments to the text and 
signed following instructions from Sir Nicholas that it was his 
ministerial "duty." 
  But three months later Sir Nicholas appeared to contradict 
that advice when he told Mr Heseltine that he had no obligation 
to sign another PII certificate in a different case. 
  There is considerable concern among ministers and MPs over 
the position of Sir Nicholas. He is seen as a pivotal figure, 
who advised members of the Cabinet and other ministers over 
their duties concerning the PII certificates. Even before Mr 
Heseltine gave his evidence, ministers were questioning whether 
Sir Nicholas could survive the inquiry's scrutiny. 
  Sir Nicholas, who will give evidence to the inquiry later 
this month, last night issued a statement defending his actions 
and saying his advice to ministers on PII had "remained 
consistent." He said: "The fact that it is for the court to 
determine the balance of the overall public interest was pointed 
up in Mr Heseltine's Pll certificate. 
  "The certificate which went before the trial judge was 
expressly amended after consultation with the Attorney General 
and leading counsel for the prosecution." 
  Mr Heseltine's evidence is the most damning account yet from 
a minister of the events leading up to the collapse of the 
Matrix Churchill trial. 
  His disclosure that he eventually signed a "watered down" 
Pll 
certificate served as an unwelcome reminder to Conservative MPs 
that the report of the Scott inquiry -- expected in the summer 
-- remains a political timebomb. His evidence appears to 
undermine the position of other ministers who signed Pll 
certificates, including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, Mr 
Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the 
Social Security Secretary. 
  Opposition MPs seized on Mr Heseltine's remarks as an 
indication that the Scott inquiry could force the resignation of 
Sir Nicholas. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry 
spokesman, said Mr Heseltine was the first Cabinet minister to 
admit there was a cover-up. "It is hard to see how the Attorney 
General can now survive. His role appears to have been to 
protect the Government rather than the course of justice," he 
said. 
  Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, 
said 
Mr Heseltine's evidence had undermined all of his ministerial 
colleagues, particularly the Attorney General. 
  "Michael Heseltine and Sir Nicholas Lyell can no longer 
remain ministers in the same government. Their accounts of the 
circumstances leading up to the signing of the public interest 
immunity certificates are flatly contradictory of each other," 
he said. 
  Downing Street last night refused to comment on Mr 
Heseltine's evidence, particularly the suggestion that he wanted 
to avoid a "cover-up". 
  Officials said the Government would await the outcome of the 
inquiry and then give its views. However, Mr Heseltine's 
remarks are a severe embarrassment for the Government which has 
always denied that there was any deliberate attempt to conceal 
the truth. 
  Mr Heseltine, the last of the senior ministers who signed 
Pll 
orders in the Matrix Churchill case to give evidence to Lord 
Justice Scott said he had initially refused to sign the 
certificate because he did not want to deny the defendants 
information relevant to their case. 
  The certificate, requiring urgent attention, was among a 
foot-high pile of papers on his desk when Mr Heseltine returned 
from a trip. Heseltine had "no discretion to waive PII...it 
must be claimed." 
  There was also a note on the history of the case which he 
read "with growing concern." The paper was marked with Mr 
Heseltine's notations, underlining and heavy scoring. 
  The first note of alarm was a reference to decisions not to 
revoke Matrix Churchill export licences and to grant new ones, 
despite fears that the company's machines were going to Baghdad 
arms factories. 
  Mr Heseltine put a question mark in the margin beside the 
paragraph. 
  Then he read that the firm's executives were being 
prosecuted, not because their exports had gone to make weapons, 
but because they had lied to the Government. 
  Mr Heseltine wrote "Why not?" in the margin. "If the real 
crime was the export of military equipment why weren't they 
being prosecuted for that as opposed to the fact that they had 
just filled out a form inaccurately?" 
  The next paragraph stated that the security services had had 
links with the firm and agents had visited Mr Paul Henderson, 
the managing director, posing as Trade Department officials. "I 
began to be preoccupied that we knew more than the 
superficialities of the submission indicated," said Mr Heseltine. 
  He then read that a Matrix Churchill employee had written to 
Lord Howe, then Foreign Secretary, warning that the firm was 
making machines to manufacture artillery shell casings for Iraq. 
The letter had been copied to the Ministry of Defence, Trade 
Department and intelligence agencies, but no actlon had been 
taken. Mr Heseltine underlined the passage heavily: "You've got 
two lots of three lines because it is telling me that everyboy 
knew." 
  The following paragraph, highlighted with furious lines in 
the margin, suggested the employee might write again, but this 
time he could address his letter to the Press. 
  "This attracted five lines. It became apparent to me that if 
this series of events unfolded I would have to go and indulge in 
the process of incommunicative answers which I was not prepared 
to do," said Mr Heseltine. 
  When he finished reading the note he decided to reject the 
legal advice that he must sign. His attitude was: "Up with this 
I will not put." 
  He summoned an immediate meeting of senior officials. "The 
upshot of it was that I said I would not sign the PII 
certificate before me," he said. 
  A minute of the discussion noted that Mr Heseltine believed 
his position would be indefensible if the judge overturned the 
PII order: "It would look as though he had been engaged in an 
attempted cover-up and had been overruled by the judge." 
  Mr Heseltine explained: "I believed that if we had this 
evidence it could not be right to suggest it was not relevant to 
the defence. I did not know all the details of the defence case 
but I did not believe It was not relevant." His position was 
explained to the Attorney General and to other ministers who had 
been asked to sign certificates in the case. 
  Sir Nicholas wrote telling Mr Heseltine that if the papers 
fell into "recognised classes normally immune from discovery" it 
was "the duty of a minister" to certify them, despite personal 
views. After amendments to the certificate, Mr Heseltine signed. 
  An official note of a meeting in November 1992 has Mr 
Heseltine telling Sir Nicholas that "no rational person could 
say the documents should not be disclosed" and "it would have 
been terrible if the defendants had gone to jail as a result of 
nondisclosure." 
  Weeks after the judge had overturned the PII certificates 
and 
the Matrix Churchill trial had collapsed, Mr Heseltine was 
handed a request for another certificate to bar documents from a 
civil case. This time he was advised that he was not duty bound 
to sign. "I was indignant," said Mr Heseltine. 
  Sir Nicholas was told that Mr Heseltine wanted to know how 
the new advice was to be reconciled with the advice in Matrix 
Churchill that he had a duty to sign. 
  At a meeting on Nov 27 1992, the Attorney General was 
minuted 
as telling Mr Heseltine that "there was not a duty in every case 
to claim PII." 
  The inquiry was adjourned until tomorrow.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The Taoiseach [Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds] has delivered a sharp dismissal of the 
proposals from the Ulster Unionist Party for a devolved assembly 
in Northern Ireland. 
  Mr. Reynolds told the Dail [Irish parliament] this afternoon 
the document published by Jim Molyneaux represented the road to 
nowhere and a cul-de-sac in political terms. Replying to 
opposition questions he said the government would not accept for 
one moment any question of talks on an internal settlement. The 
government believed the three strand talks process was the only 
basis on which to proceed and they were waiting to hear the 
British Government's view. Our political editor, Donald Kemp. 
  [Kemp] Two weeks ago, after their meeting in London, the 
Taoiseach and the British prime minister committed their 
governments to a resumption of the three strand talks process. 
But yesterday the Ulster Unionists published their proposals 
for a devolved northern assembly and said they would not talk 
with Dublin until it was established. 
  However, in the Dail today that position earned them a 
strong 
rebuke from the Taoiseach. 
  [Begin Reynolds recording] The Irish Government will not 
entertain a one-sided approach that downgrades the Irish 
dimension and makes any discussion of it contingent on the prior 
achievement of an internal settlement. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Dick Spring, Irish deputy prime minister and </F>
foreign minister, by Laurent Zecchini; place and date not given: 
"We Are Highly Dedicated Europeans"] 
  [Text] Irish Vice Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Dick 
Spring is the leader of the [Irish] Labor Party (the left wing 
of the coalition in power in Dublin). The interview he gave us 
covered his country's place in Europe. 
  [Zecchini] In terms of its exports, Ireland will benefit 
from 
the GATT agreement, but it will lose out on agriculture, 
following the reduction of farming subsidies. Are you satisfied 
all the same? 
  [Spring] Indeed, our economy is highly focused on exports, 
but our agriculture is also well protected by the commitments 
undertaken at the most recent Community meetings. If there is 
an imbalance regarding the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP] 
within the context of GATT, it is the European Council that will 
have to review the question of compensations. In any case, we 
will have to wait several years to see just how compatible the 
terms of the reformed CAP are with the rules agreed under GATT. 
  [Zecchini] Ireland has always managed to obtain substantial 
structural funds, but are these not short-term victories, to the 
extent that you have an economy that is increasingly dependent 
on financial support? 
  [Spring] There are different ways of looking at things. What 
we are trying to do within the Community is achieve a kind of 
balance regarding our various economic situations. We entered 
the EC with a standard of living of about 66 percent of the 
Community-wide average. Today, we have attained a level of 70 
percent, so we are making progress. Clearly, it would not be in 
our interest to belong to a Community which merely served the 
interests of the richest countries. A large proportion of the 
structural funds are being spent on developing our 
infrastructures and educational system. This will enable us to 
heighten our competitiveness and have an economy which is 
increasingly compatible with that of our partners. 
  [Zecchini] One day the Community could decide that some 
countries in Eastern Europe are in greater need of Community 
funds than Ireland. 
  [Spring] That is a question of balance. We are extremely 
aware that the development of the countries in Central Europe 
will become a decisive factor regarding the security and 
stability of all of Europe. However, there are both advantages 
and disadvantages linked with this new situation: Even if our 
financial assistance is reduced, we will at the same time have 
access to new markets. 
  [Zecchini] The Irish are considered to be "good Europeans," 
but that does not prevent you from buying Boeing aircraft 
instead of Airbus, and of equipping your police force with 
Japanese motorcycles. Could you be pragmatic Europeans? 
  [Spring] We are highly dedicated Europeans. We want to buy 
in Europe as much as possible. Moreover, there are major 
opportunities for our own products that we have not yet 
exploited, namely on the French, Italian, and German markets. 
Although many of our traditional industries suffered when we 
joined the EC, we want to play our role in developing Europe. 
Although the criteria enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty are 
imposing very tight constraints on our economy, ironically 
enough today we are closer to fulfilling those criteria than 
many other countries which are strongly in favor of them. Mark 
my words, the Irish will continue to be good, solid Europeans. 
It is in all our interests -- especially bearing Russian 
instability in mind -- that Europe should continue to develop, 
with the small countries continuing to exert their influence, as 
we have been doing since 1973.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial] </F>
  [Text] Sinn Fein provided the most important clarification 
of all at their weekend Ardfheis [annual conference] -- the 
Downing Street Declaration, in its present form, is dead so far 
as they are concerned. For cynical political reasons, they will 
not say so publicly, but the unmistakeable message from Tallaght 
-- underscored by another incendiary blitz on jobs and 
businesses in the North -- was that the constitutional parties 
should waste no more time trying to spot significant policy 
shifts in Provo speak. There haven't been any, and there won't 
be. 
  Even the Hume-Adams initiative which set off the present 
peace momentum -- and which the SDLP [Social Democratic and 
Labor Party] leader naively forecast at one stage could achieve 
peace in a week -- has turned out to be a mirage. Neither Gerry 
Adams, nor the Provisional movement, for all the reassuring 
rhetoric that we have heard in recent months, is prepared to 
accept that the principle of Unionist consent to any new 
political arrangement also entails the right to say No. 
  The two sovereign Governments have accepted that fact. It 
has been endorsed by some 90 per cent of the population of this 
island, according to the latest poll. And even two-thirds of 
the Provos' own supporters, according to the findings, want them 
to call off the murder campaign and join the political process. 
  But while Sinn Fein continues to call on everyone else for a 
change of attitude, its leadership seems incapable of doing just 
that. It is convenient to hide behind the socalled Unionist 
veto. That allows the Provos to shirk the much more formidable 
task of convincing the North's Unionist majority that their best 
interests lie in a political arrangement with the rest of this 
island. You don't do that by shooting them and blowing up their 
businesses. And even if the British left in the morning, that 
task of persuasion would still have to be undertaken -- and it 
still could not be done with guns and bombs. 
  The Sinn Fein leadership, whether through lack of courage or 
fear of their paramilitary masters, wasted the unique 
opportunity provided by the Ardfheis to give substance to the 
current peace process. Now the two Governments and the other 
constitutional parties have to move on the the next stage 
without them. 
  The most intolerable veto of all would be to allow a party 
which commands just two per cent electoral support in this 
country -- and whose real political influence comes out of the 
barrel of a gun -- to frustrate the widespread desire for peace 
in both parts of this island.

<F P=106> [Article by political correspondent Emily O'Reilly: </F>
"Clarified: Why There Won't Be a Yes Or a No"] 
  [Text] Apart from flashing it in neon on Martin McGuiness's 
forehead, the message from the weekend Sinn Fein Ardfheis 
[annual conference] could not have been clearer: there will be 
no definitive response to the Joint Declaration until and unless 
the British reopen direct contact with the Provisional movement. 
  That line was given its clearest airing in the speeches of 
Gerry Adams and Mr McGuiness, but it ran through the bulk of 
contributions from the floor during the debate on what Sinn Fein 
calls the Irish peace initiative. 
  It is not a new line. Sinn Fein's demand for direct talks 
with the British in advance of a response to the Declaration has 
been stated almost from the beginning of this phase of the peace 
process. But the party used the opportunity of the hugely high 
profile Ardfheis to ensure that neither the Irish nor the 
British Government could be in any doubt about their intentions. 
  Sinn Fein insist that any such contacts would deal with 
"clarification." The British, who have refused to reopen the 
secret channels of communication, insist in turn that what Sinn 
Fein want is tantamount to negotiation. The truth, as ever, is 
in between. 
  Sinn Fein want the British to spell out their ultimate 
intentions for the North -- they want to know how far that 
government will go in forcing a political settlement between the 
Unionist community in the North and nationalist community of the 
whole island. They want to know, in effect, if Britain is 
prepared to drop the Unionist veto. 
  The dropping of the veto would allow for the sort of 
national 
self-determination Sinn Fein wants: the island as a whole 
deciding a political settlement free of the "impediment" of the 
Unionist right to say No. To use a much over used phrase, Sinn 
Fein wants a level playing pitch. 
  The flexibility and acknowledgement of the need for Unionist 
consent that Sinn Fein speaks of is always in the context of a 
post-veto Ireland. They insist that they will accept any 
political settlement agreed to by the people, as long as all the 
people of the island decide on it. 
  But this also implies that while Sinn Fein would find 
Unionist consent desirable, that community's right to opt out of 
some future arrangement would be severely limited. How strong a 
voice would the Unionists have in the context of a 32-county 
poll? 
  It is unlikely now that anything the Irish Government says 
or 
does to the Provisional movement is going to budge them from 
their current position on direct contacts with the British. 
  Albert Reynolds cannot deliver what Sinn Fein wants even it 
it was his political desire to do so. It is the British who 
govern Northern Ireland who alone will decide its future. 
  Sinn Fein are also confident that the contacts with the 
British will be reopened, though not in the short term. Indeed, 
the party may be looking towards a post-Major administration 
before the talks begin again. 
  But they already believe there is evidence that even this 
administration is budging. Sir Patrick Mayhew's pleasant 
sounding noises in the direction of Northern nationalists last 
week, plus John Major's conciliatory article in the Irish News, 
have been interpreted by Sinn Fein as a sign that the British 
are softening their "no contacts" stance. 
  Sinn Fein logic naturally suggests that if the party 
continue 
to hold out for those contacts, then the British will eventually 
relent. 
  They believe, in any case, that the British are now well 
down 
the disengagement road. They even acknowledged, for the first 
time, that the Joint Declaration was a nationalist advance, as 
was, they say, the Anglo Irish Agreement -- a document they 
vehemently rubbished at the time. 
  Sinn Fein naturally believe that both advances emerged 
directly from the Provisionals' ballot box-and-armalite tactics. 
And, therefore, why should they now abandon such a "successful" 
strategy, given their belief that the British are moving just 
the way they want them? 
  The Government must now be aware that Sinn Fein have in 
effect rejected the Declaration. It is not enough in itself to 
engage them -- their old demands on the British remain. 
  Following the Ardfheis it will now be virtually impossible 
for the Taoiseach [Irish prime minister] to state that Sinn Fein 
must be given more time. They have made their decision -- they 
want dialogue with the British and out of that dialogue they 
want commitments to a British policy change on the Unionist veto. 
  The Government knows that is not achievable in the short to 
medium term. Furthermore, they have signed a binding agreement 
acknowledging the right of that veto to remain. 
  What options are now open to them? A resuscitation of the 
talks process now seems inevitable. 
  However, the Government is unlikely to have much appetite 
for 
that, given the failure of previous talks to deliver anything 
before and given the Taoiseach's belief that such a process 
would have its best chance of success in an atmosphere of peace.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by Thierry </F>
Portes and Franz-Olivier Giesbert; place and date not given: 
"Primaries: Pasqua Speeds Up"] 
  [Text] It was at the Chemical Society Headquarters in Paris 
on 12 June 1991 in the presence of many deputies of what was 
then the opposition, and led by Valery Giscard d'Estaing and 
Jacques Chirac, that the UDF [Union for French Democracy] and 
RPR [Rally for the Republic], meeting within the UPF [Union for 
France], signed the charter for French-style primaries, adopted 
by the UPF political office on 10 April. This charter makes 
provision for "presenting and supporting a joint candidate at 
the next presidential election" and "giving the men and women 
who support the UPF's values" the responsibility for choosing 
this candidate according to a system inspired by the American 
model, in which the Democrat and Republican Parties leave it to 
their respective supporters to appoint their candidate before he 
runs for the U.S. Presidency. 
  [LE FIGARO] [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard said just 
yesterday that Edouard Balladur was the best candidate for the 
1995 election. Are you not pleased that the presidential 
campaign has already been launched, given that you like 
political contest so much? 
  [Pasqua] I do not think it is a good thing. The prime 
minister reminded the members of his government -- and he was 
right to do so -- that he did not want anybody to become 
involved in the presidential debate before the end of the year. 
  [LE FIGARO] He was not heeded, even by his own people.... 
  [Pasqua] He ought to reaffirm this rule. To all, including 
those loyal to him. It is too soon to talk of the presidential 
election now. But what is more serious is the fact that great 
inconsistency is appearing in the majority leaders' political 
approach. We have two elections this year: the canton 
elections and the European elections. 
  In the first, in most cantons, we -- the RPR, UDF, and the 
government -- will support majority union candidates in the 
first round. 
  In the second, from what I understand, the majority parties 
have decided to draw up a single list. This union list will 
therefore be supported by the RPR, the UDF, and the government. 
But in the following election -- the presidential election -- 
despite the pledges made by the parties forming the existing 
majority, the possibility of presenting several candidates is 
being considered! I find it difficult to understand the 
rationale behind this approach. 
  [LE FIGARO] So, you will revive your plan for primaries 
enabling the majority voters to decide between the RPR and UDF 
candidates before the first round. 
  [Pasqua] This is a pledge which we made solemnly to our 
voters. It was approved by the RPR and UDF, and signed by 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac. We took this 
course because the primaries make it possible to present a union 
candidate from the first round. There would be nothing worse 
for the current majority than to be divided. However, now, if 
nothing is done, we can be certain that there will be several 
majority candidates in 1995. 
  [LE FIGARO] How many? 
  [Pasqua] Two, three, four... However, this is to 
misunderstand the deep-seated feelings of the voters. The 
French people want union. Last March, they voted for a united 
majority and they want the government to shoulder its 
responsibilities for maintaining that union. 
  [LE FIGARO] So, you will revive the primaries process... 
  [Pasqua] We who were behind this approach, in the RPR and 
UDF, will meet next week and see what conclusions we must draw 
from the present situation. 
  [LE FIGARO] In other words? 
  [Pasqua] We will revive the idea of primaries. In my 
capacity as interior minister, I think my main political 
responsibility is to make every effort to maintain and develop 
the majority union. 
  [LE FIGARO] When will you submit this plan? 
  [Pasqua] This plan will have to be submitted in the spring 
session. Everybody will then shoulder his responsibilities. 
Those who prefer several candidates, in other words division 
and the risk of defeat, will have to say so publicly. They will 
not only have to say so, but will have to shoulder their 
responsibility in Parliament. 
  [LE FIGARO] So, you are still in favor of a single majority 
candidate for the forthcoming presidential election? 
  [Pasqua] I always have been. I am more than ever. 
  [LE FIGARO] Several prominent members of the majority point 
out that submitting your plan in the spring session will mean 
the majority discussing the presidential election from the 
spring, which conflicts with the prime minister's wish for this 
debate not to be started until 1995. 
  [Pasqua] No. We will discuss the election itself, but not 
the candidates! My problem is not one of candidates. I am not 
deciding in favor of one candidate rather than another. I am 
saying that since there is a risk of division, we must provide 
ourselves with the means of avoiding that trap. And the system 
of primaries is a means of avoiding it. 
  [LE FIGARO] In a democracy, and especially with a 
two-round election, is it not natural for several candidates to 
stand for election? Does the first round not provide an 
opportunity to distinguish between them? 
  [Pasqua] In a democracy, it is natural for several prominent 
people to feel that they have the abilities required to lead the 
country. But, if the current process is allowed to run its 
course, we will have two candidates in the majority appointed by 
the parties, in addition to those who reject this rationale. 
  As for distinguishing between them in the first round, the 
last two presidential elections -- in 1981 and 1988 -- should 
give us pause for thought. 
  [LE FIGARO] How do you intend to impose this system of 
primaries, when you know that its main objective is first to 
settle an internal majority problem, between Jacques Chirac, 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and now Edouard Balladur? 
  [Pasqua] But this system can also be used on the Left! At 
all events, those who do not wish to submit to it, will not do 
so. 
  [LE FIGARO] According to its chairman, the UDF will not 
submit to it. 
  [Pasqua] That is not a problem. The UDF has signed an 
agreement with the RPR. If these two parties think that their 
signatures are not binding, they will have to say so to the 
French people. And everybody will draw their conclusions. 
  [LE FIGARO] But it is not betraying a secret to say that the 
prime minister is not in favor of your plan for primaries... 
  [Pasqua] The prime minister is neither in favor of it nor 
against it. He does not intend to be involved for the time 
being. As far as I am concerned, I have already said, and I 
repeat that I will not allow a process of majority disunity to 
be started without reacting. 
  [LE FIGARO] What fate do you reserve for people who do not 
submit to your system? 
  [Pasqua] There are two hypotheses: Either this system is 
implemented or it is not. If it is not, this system will have 
had no negative impact on the majority because we will be back 
where we started. If the system is implemented, it is quite 
obvious that those who submit to it will accept its rules. This 
means that a candidate will emerge and that he will immediately 
be supported by millions of French people. He will therefore 
have a considerable advantage over those who have not submitted 
to the primaries and who would nonetheless like to be 
candidates. There will be a union candidate and the others will 
be candidates of division. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you think there is now a majority in the 
Assembly to adopt a system of primaries? 
  [Pasqua] I do not see why the deputies should be less aware 
than the voters of the need for union, of the necessity to have 
a single candidate, whoever he might be. I am not saying: It 
must be Mr. X or Mr. Y. I am saying: There must be a union 
candidate. Just as I said: We must have a union list for the 
European elections and, once we reach agreement on a union list, 
the name of the person heading the list is not very important. 
In the parliamentary, canton, and European elections, we are 
united. In the municipal elections, the RPR and UDF are 
currently reaching agreement on union candidates in all communes 
with more than 30,000 inhabitants. In short, for all elections, 
and especially when there is an election based on a list of 
candidates and there are 80 places to be allocated, we have a 
union. And, for the presidential election, for which there is 
only one position, we will have a fight among several 
candidates? That is an inconsistent approach! Explain that to 
the French people.... 
  [LE FIGARO] What do you say to those who think that a single 
majority candidate from the first round of the presidential 
election would dry up the reservoir of majority votes? 
  [Pasqua] You will certainly have Ecologist candidates, a 
National Front candidate, perhaps Philippe de Villiers, and 
probably others... But, if there is a majority union candidate 
in the first round, it is not impossible that there will only be 
one round. At all events, to guide the country's development, 
and give it the necessary impetus, we need a candidate who has 
attracted a large number of votes in the first round. 
  [LE FIGARO] If a single candidate is needed, should there 
not also be a single majority party? 
  [Pasqua] I am one of those who think that the foundations of 
a big single party will be laid in the presidential election -- 
a party which will unite all those who have decided to support 
the new president. 
  [LE FIGARO] Are you thinking of a merger between the RPR and 
UDF? 
  [Pasqua] I am not thinking of a merger. But given that we 
will have presented joint candidates in all the elections, the 
single movement will exist. In practice. 
  [LE FIGARO] What form do you think this system of primaries 
should take? 
  [Pasqua] What is certain is that the studies we have carried 
out in the Interior Ministry show that the organization of 
primaries is possible, that this system cannot be compulsory, 
and that it cannot be imposed on the political parties by law: 
The Constitution states that the parties are free to organize 
and administer themselves. All we can do is make primaries 
possible and ensure that they cannot be attacked at 
constitutional level. It is in this framework that we are 
examining the question. 
  [LE FIGARO] When do you think these primaries will take 
place? 
  [Pasqua] At the end of 1994 or beginning of 1995. 
  [LE FIGARO] Holding them in 1994 would conflict with the 
prime minister's wishes. 
  [Pasqua] If we reach agreement on there being just one 
candidate, we can wait until 1 January 1995, or even 1 February 
1995. That simply presupposes that the candidates for the 
presidential election should be known in the final weeks of 1994. 
  [LE FIGARO] When will the presidential election be held? 
  [Pasqua] On 16 and 30 April at the earliest. On 23 April 
and 7 May at the latest.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial report] Only the EU Council can decide, acting 
on a qualified majority, to close a foreign border, reports 
Renaud de Chazournes in the 19-20 February Paris daily LE 
QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS in connection with Greece's unilateral 
closing of the border with neighboring The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. Nevertheless, Greece is 
attempting to justify its action by affirming that it conforms 
to European law, with reference to Article 224 of the Treaty of 
Rome, he continues. The reference is "rather unfortunate," he 
notes, since the article stipulates that consultations between 
member states must precede any action of this type. However, it 
is "crystal clear" that the European Union (EU) is powerless if 
one of the member states contravenes Article 224, for the treaty 
in question does not envision exclusion, or even punitive 
measures. For instance, notes de Chazournes, Athens' European 
partners cannot freeze structural funds granted to Greece even 
if, in the process, EU common foreign and security policy is 
jeopardized. This does not mean that Brussels, where the Greek 
move has been termed "irrational," easily accepts Greece's fait 
accompli, he adds. In fact, a written explanation has been 
demanded so that the Commission can review the blockade's 
legality. 
  "There are few illusions in Paris on the European Council's 
margin of maneuver," de Chazournes comments. At most, 11 
countries will simply "express their annoyance" with the present 
president of the EU. For good measure, he adds, the Greek 
ambassador was called in by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 
18 February to provide an explanation.

<F P=106> [Marco Panara report: "Occhetto Supports Alliance: </F>
`Justified Attack'"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, 
Secretary] Achille Occhetto received the second piece of good 
news of the day from NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner 
himself. It was the news that NATO's headquarters in Brussels 
was waiting for but feared that it might not hear. For Achille 
Occhetto, the first PDS secretary to be invited to NATO 
headquarters, who happened to be in Brussels on the very day 
when NATO carried out the first military operation in its 
history, it was like scoring a goal just as the final whistle is 
sounding. 
  The first news -- about the four Serbian aircraft downed by 
the NATO fighters -- created an anxious atmosphere around his 
visit, distracting people and creating a mood of expectancy. 
There were some certainties -- that the Serbian aircraft were 
flying in the no-fly zone, that they were armed with 
air-to-surface missiles and bombs, and that the NATO pilots 
issued three warnings. And there was an uncertainty: What 
would the political cost of this "policing" operation be? The 
problem was that it was Moscow that would determine this 
political price. 
  Speaking with journalists after his first round of meetings, 
Occhetto defined his position as follows: "As far as we know, 
the operation was carried out in implementation of the UN 
decisions and is therefore entirely legitimate. I am worried 
about the danger that this event could disrupt the equilibrium 
which, by means of military pressure and political action, it 
has been possible to establish in Bosnia, partly by involving 
Russia. I hope that Moscow will not change its position 
following today's events." 
  Then when, a few minutes before 1800 hours [1700 GMT], 
Manfred Woerner entered room 8 at NATO headquarters to meet with 
the PDS delegation, the report from Moscow was enough to dispel 
the anxiety and to break the ice at the same time. Reassured by 
Moscow's attitude, the PDS secretary and the NATO secretary 
general were able to reassure each other with a sense of relief. 
  "Mr. Woerner was pleased to receive confirmation from Mr. 
Occhetto personally that even with the PDS in government Italy's 
membership in NATO would not be called into question," one 
witness said after the meeting, "and Mr. Occhetto was happy to 
feel that he was being examined and not to perceive any signs of 
doubts about the possibility of a progressive government in 
Italy." 
  Achille Occhetto's visit to NATO headquarters and his 
meetings with the organization's most senior officials had been 
postponed several times in recent weeks because of Woerner's 
health, and by chance happened to fall at the very start of the 
election campaign. Occhetto took advantage of this fact in order 
to issue a message of reassurance for both domestic and external 
consumption. 
  In the morning the PDS delegation met with Ambassador Sergio 
Silvio Balanzino, NATO's deputy secretary general; then over 
breakfast with the permanent representatives of the 
organization's various member countries and a number of military 
officials including Sir Richard Vincent, chairman of NATO's 
chiefs of staff committee, and General Dangerfield, commander of 
the international military staff; and at last in the afternoon 
with Manfred Woerner. 
  "I reaffirmed that our position includes NATO membership for 
Italy." Occhetto told journalists at the press conference 
following his meetings. "It does not make sense to say that 
Italy should leave it, but neither is it enough to say that we 
will remain within it. We are aware that there is a problem 
regarding the redefinition of NATO's role; moreover, this is not 
an issue that we raised but one on which is already being 
generally discussed. The end of the bipolar system has resolved 
the problems of European security, and NATO, which was organized 
to guarantee peace within a bipolar system, must now be equipped 
to deal with the new and different challenges that present 
themselves to peace." 
  The PDS' position sees NATO maintaining relations of close 
cooperation with other international organizations, especially 
with the United Nations, whose supranational aspect must be 
accentuated, according to the PDS. 
  "Over breakfast," Occhetto said, "we discussed the UN 
Security Council, whose structure stems directly from the 
outcome of World War II. Around the table we talked about 
granting membership to major regional areas in the future so as 
to eliminate the perception by poor countries that any 
operations decided on by the United Nations are in the interests 
of individual wealthy countries or groups of wealthy countries 
and to avert jealousies and misunderstandings among the wealthy 
countries. 
  "We intend to impart a dynamic approach to NATO's role which 
takes into account the new post-communist situation. I was 
pleased to note that Mr. Woerner welcomed this stance on our 
part."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Communist Renewal Utterly Condemns </F>
Action, League Welcomes It"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Communist Renewal harshly condemned the 
downing of four Serbian aircraft in the Bosnian "no-fly zone," 
whereas the League welcomed the news. "This action may 
shipwreck the fragile truce which is currently under way," 
Communist Renewal stated. "We are asking ourselves what NATO's 
true motives might be. Having been forced to renounce the 
implementation of the ultimatum as a result of Russia's 
intervention, NATO now seems to be looking for other pretexts to 
address the issue once again in military rather than in 
diplomatic terms." The Northern League did not share this 
opinion: "This is the first time that the violation of a 
cease-fire imposed by the United Nations in Bosnia has been 
penalized, and this is undoubtedly a positive fact. NATO's role 
in the Bosnian conflict is confirming how essential NATO is for 
European security, contrary to what certain political forces 
within the so-called progressive alignment are saying."

<F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "NATO Problematic for Right </F>
Too"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Italian Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] 
Gianfranco Fini, the gentleman of Italian politics, writes it, 
but will not speak it. He is too cautious and too polite to 
speak this dirty word during an election campaign. Fini is not 
[Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti and does not believe that 
[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi should be fooled with. So in 
his article, published in small print in IL SECOLO, the MSI 
organ, it is difficult to find "Renewing NATO," the proud MSI 
objective proclaimed anew in the National Alliance's program. 
NATO has caused real problems for the progressive alignment, 
and it looks like it is now about to create disarray within the 
freedom alignment. 
  Mistrust is perhaps too weak a word, but hatred is perhaps 
too strong. The fact remains that the National Alliance 
absolutely cannot abide the Americans. Its dream is a great 
Europe, with East and West at last united, with "no subjugation" 
to the United States. "European autonomy in political and 
military decisionmaking." The first political decision would be 
an alliance with South America. "A comprehensive understanding 
embodying broad plans, with Italy and Spain as its vanguard of 
special influence." 
  There would also be a "30-year European plan for Africa." 
This is the "European pillar" -- a force "competing" with the 
United States and the Far East. 
  This is no mere side issue and related issues are clarified 
still further: The National Alliance says that the Maastricht 
Treaty too must be rejected (it is demanding a revision of the 
treaty) and of course that it is necessary to ensure that, 
"Germany's reunification" be followed by Italy's, with the 
return of Istria, Fiume [Rijeka], and Dalmatia, "by means of 
international treaties." This Super Europe must also have a 
seat on the UN Security Council. 
  Remember Berlusconi? He said: "I will confine myself to the 
facts. I have read Fini's program; it is a liberal democratic 
program." Another disappointment: Berlusconi's free market 
economy, the driving force behind the promised Italian miracle, 
is virtually rejected by Fini. 
  Of course, free enterprise is encouraged, but beware: "The 
state must create a social market economy." Privatization, 
sure. But it must facilitate "popular share ownership" across 
the nation. So it is necessary to avert the danger "of outright 
colonizations of entire production sectors." This, because "we 
must not forget that our European partners vigorously protect 
their own enterprises." So privatization must be carried out 
without encouraging "domestic or foreign competitors that want 
only to acquire centers of production with the aim of creating 
monopolies or oligopolies." 
  There must be some protectionism, and let this not upset 
Professor Martini, Berlusconi's economist. 
  Will a conflict now break out? Fini and Berlusconi have 
other things to think about. However, free trade and 
Atlanticism have always been fixed principles for Giorgio 
Caradonna -- a long-time deputy with 11 trials and seven 
sentences behind him, one of the few MSI figures friendly toward 
Israel. He is a nonconformist. His motion at the National 
Alliance constituent assembly was thrown out and he was left 
without a job. He is not running for reelection. 
  Caradonna has therefore turned to bureaucratic channels. 
Unable to have the judiciary approve his motion, he has 
initiated proceedings against the entire MSI. Who decided on 
its new symbol? Who decided on its candidates? "If I win this 
case," he explained enthusiastically at Rome's law courts 
yesterday, "the National Alliance lists throughout Italy will be 
invalidated, and the party will be unable to contest the 
elections."

<F P=106> [Article by Massimo Arcidiacono: "Fiscal Federalism, </F>
Umberto Raises the Stakes"] 
  [Text] Umberto Bossi wanted all his electoral "apostles" 
gathered around him for the presentation of the election 
manifesto (red binder, 40 closely written pages, which each one 
clutches under his or her arm). It is the official baptism of a 
new political battle that will last a month and change the 
country, and it is perhaps a benediction as well: "I want you 
to go out there and tell the people that we have remained what 
we were in the beginning, we have not changed, we have done our 
utmost for federalism. We have done all that could be done." 
Bossi's oratorical style is the same as at the latest rallies 
(Baggio, Brescia, Piacenza). He lashes out all round: at 
Fini's "fascists," at Occhetto's "communists," and at his ally, 
Berlusconi, as well. As to the rest, Bossi leafs through the 
book of League dreams for the benefit of his future deputies. 
Fiscal federalism, free market forces, fewer direct taxes and 
lower labor costs, privatization taken to extremes, and so on: 
a list of things to be done now made flesh in the Northern 
League's "abridged election manifesto." 
<H5>  Public Deficit </H5>
  "What needs to be done is: diverting public spending away 
from current expenditures toward investment expenditure, 
restructuring the public system, reducing state interference in 
the economy in favor of private initiative." The specific 
measures suggested include restructuring the civil service, 
radically reviewing state holdings, privatization, lowering 
interest rates, replacing the loss of earnings compensation fund 
and the "mobility" system with unemployment benefits, tax 
incentives for private investment, greater recourse to forms of 
indirect taxation, and the creation of fiscal federalism. 
<H5>  Fiscal Federalism </H5>
  "Fiscal federalism comprises two basic elements: investing 
the local authorities with full autonomy in matters of taxation, 
and making the local authorities responsible for spending, which 
must be commensurate with revenue." A percentage of such revenue 
must be payable to the federal state so that it can "finance 
matters of general interest," but it is the prerogative of the 
local authorities to administer the major part of their revenue. 
<H5>  Industrial Policy </H5>
  "This must evolve along totally different lines from those 
followed to date. The first major difference must consist in 
drawing a clear distinction between the type of development 
pursued in the north and the type pursued in the south." The 
north must widen its product range and promote research; the 
south, "complementing (and not in competition with) the north," 
must develop products "appropriate to its geocultural 
conditions" (specialized tourism and agriculture, aerospace). 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  "More market forces and less state intervention to tackle 
unemployment" is the slogan. "We must put a stop to the welfare 
handout policy, lighten the burden of taxation and other levies, 
abolish unjustified welfare charges. invest in research, 
introduce wage zoning [system whereby wage levels vary according 
to region] to boost employment, especially in the south.... 
Greater flexibility is needed as regards both working hours and 
atypical forms of employment. The regulatory and fiscal 
framework must be simplified to stimulate an increase in 
self-employment." 
<H5>  Trade </H5>
  The goal is to create "a free market accessible to all 
competent, hardworking traders," and, to this end, "the law must 
provide tax incentives for widening, specializing, converting, 
merging, and ceding businesses." A gradual liberalization of 
licenses and the pursuit of alternative solutions to the 
deregulation of opening hours are advocated. 
<H5>  Immigration </H5>
  "The flow of immigration must be stemmed and the requisite 
labor quotas might be strictly subject to possession of a work 
contract and access to housing." 
<H5>  Defense </H5>

  "The armed forces must be radically restructured via the 
creation of a mixed, i.e., volunteer-professional and draft, 
recruitment system." Also: the safeguarding and preserving of 
peace in areas of fundamental strategic and economic importance; 
an increased effort in the fight against organized crime, 
consider the defense industry as a strategic public base 
essential to the whole industrial system; recognize the right of 
conscientious objection and create a generalized national 
civilian service. 
<H5>  Broadcasting </H5>
  The League wants a privatized RAI [Italian Broadcasting 
Corporation] restricted, as far as current affairs are 
concerned, to accurate, strictly factual news bulletins. 
Privatizing the RAI "will bring about a restructuring in the 
private sector," with clear-cut rules that will "restore the 
right to equal time" and introduce "strict antitrust regulations 
and well-defined limits on advertising." 
<H5>  Health </H5>
  "Full financial, administrative, and legislative autonomy 
for 
the regions," plus: greater powers to be invested in the 
provincial authorities, reduction of the ministry's role, 
radical transformation of the USSL's [local health care units] 
into health care districts, "true specialized concerns managed 
as businesses, the abolition of health insurance via the 
national health fund, and freedom of choice...between private 
insurance cover and nonprofit professional and vocational health 
and insurance funds."

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] How does Silvio Berlusconi answer the 
attacks made by his ally [Northern League leader] Umberto Bossi? 
  [Bossi] Ours is a great idea, a strong idea, a great project 
to give Italy a liberal-democratic majority and government. I 
believe that this idea is so strong that it cannot fail but to 
advance confidently. It is stronger than protagonists and men, 
and perhaps stronger even than their particular positions -- and 
why not? -- than their egoism and their tawdriness. 
  [Reporter] So you see Bossi and [National Alliance leader 
Gianfranco] Fini coming together again? 
  [Berlusconi] I see a project that will win. 
  [Reporter] All the political forces want to name the prime 
minister. Does Forza Italia also want its own prime minister? 
  [Berlusconi] No, I believe that Italians will choose a prime 
minister with their votes. If, as I forecast looking at today's 
opinion polls, the freedom alignment or the group for good 
government -- that is, the liberal-democratic group -- will win. 
The votes obtained within this group will indicate who should 
be given the task of forming a government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ferdinando Adornato, Italian Democratic </F>
Alliance, AD, leader, by Sebastiano Messina in Rome on 24 
February: "Adornato: `Bertinotti Betraying Alliance'"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Messina] Mr. Adornato, 
what on earth is happening to the progressive alliance's 
"wonderful war machine?" What are we to believe -- the strict 
liberal recommendations of [Finance Minister Vincenzo] Visco and 
[Budget Minister Luigi] Spaventa, or the threatening 
proclamations of [Communist Renewal leader Fausto] Bertinotti 
for a tax on treasury bills, his praise for the strikes that 
have brought railroad stations to a standstill, and his warnings 
about a reappraisal of NATO? 
  [Adornato] I want to say something to Bertinotti right away: 
Let us not play games, please. There is something extremely 
serious at stake here, namely, the country's government for the 
next five years. The fact is that this election campaign is not 
as the voters expected. 
  [Messina] Whose fault is it? 
  [Adornato] It is everyone's fault. The law permitted the 
creation of two broad and consistent progressive alignments 
against the conservatives, but instead the parties -- all of 
them -- have pursued the rationale of the proportional system. 
They have come together to win more votes, but the alignments 
do not coincide on matters of policy. The Right is forming 
obscure, agreements with [Northern League leader Umberto] Bossi 
who cannot tolerate [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi, 
[Italian Social Movement leader Gianfranco] Fini who cannot 
tolerate Bossi, Bossi who cannot tolerate Fini, and Berlusconi 
who says: Maybe it would have been better for me to stand alone. 
  [Messina]It seems to me that the progressive front has some 
minor problems, too.... 
  [Adornato] Who is denying it? The difference with respect to 
the Right is that everything happens out in the open, but even 
among us there is not consistency between policies and 
alignments. 
  [Messina] But you of the Democratic Alliance [AD] also 
agreed 
to establish the alliance of progressive forces, and you too 
were at the negotiations when its establishment was announced, 
were you not? 
  [Adornato] Well, actually we proposed something different. 
We said "no" to Communist Renewal. But we of the AD, who are 
the youngest of all and must therefore show the others the 
respect due to our elders, were told that we could not lay down 
the law. And indeed, we did not. We were told that we were 
imposing ideological vetoes. But that was no veto; it was a 
prediction that things would turn out as indeed they have. 
  [Messina] Let us be honest: You progressive forces set off 
without properly broaching the issue of the government program. 
You evaded the obstacle, and now you are paying for that 
mistake. 
  [Adornato] No, the mistake was to have formed an alliance 
that lacked consistency between policies and alignments. 
Communist Renewal, by its own legitimate choice, has no program 
for the government of this country. Bertinotti's continual 
harangues show that what Communist Renewal wants is not to 
participate in the government but to carve out a proportional 
opposition space for itself. 
  [Messina] But could you not have promptly resolved the 
problems of the strikes, treasury bills, NATO, and all the rest, 
instead of allowing these bombshells to explode in the very 
midst of the election campaign? 
  [Adornato] Let us make one thing clear: Communist Renewal is 
a member of an electoral accord, not of a government agreement. 
Only the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], the AD, and the 
Social Christians have discussed and presented a government 
program. Certainly, the inconsistency remains. But we issued a 
warning in plenty of time. And now it is sad to witness the 
dishonest use that Communist Renewal is making of this election 
campaign. 
  [Messina] Why do you talk in terms of dishonesty? If 
Bertinotti has not adhered to your government program, he can 
say whatever he likes about treasury bills, can he not? 
  [Adornato] Yes, but instead of facilitating a victory by the 
alliance of which he is a member, he is concerned only with 
gathering votes for his own party in the proportional vote. 
This, to the detriment of everyone else. Moreover, Bertinotti 
is also betraying the sense of responsibility toward the country 
that was demanded of the old irresponsible political class. 
Because, if you are a responsible person, you cannot go back to 
electrification plus the soviets [paraphrase of Lenin's 
definition of communism]. Of course, he is not the main person 
to betray this sense of responsibility. The main one is 
Berlusconi. 
  [Messina] Does Berlusconi beat Bertinotti? 
  [Adornato] Yes, because yet again he is asking the voters 
for 
a blank cheque. If someone smiles and says, "When I come to 
power I will perform the Italian miracle," he is insulting the 
Italian people. It is not enough to promise to reduce taxes in 
order then to be able to do so and to actually do so. But if we 
want to fall yet again into the hands of someone who stands up 
and makes such promises, this kind of [shipping magnate] Achille 
Lauro of television, then of course we are free to do so. 
  [Messina] Let us return to the progressive alignment and its 
problems. If you perceived this rift on the Left in good time, 
why did you not stand up and leave? 
  [Adornato] For the simple reason that a victory by the Right 
would be a victory for irresponsibility and destabilization. 
Berlusconi wants a market with no rules. As Spaventa said, if 
hitherto politics has managed business, we will have business 
managing politics. This is why we stayed on, to combat this 
Right and to defend the line of reform represented by Ciampi. 
We stayed on, even though we do not like the progressive 
alignment, because the real choice on 27 March will be between 
Ciampi and Berlusconi. 
  [Messina] What will happen if the progressive alignment 
needs 
Communist Renewal's parliamentarians in order to govern? Will 
it request them or reject them? 
  [Adornato] I cannot answer that. We will have to see what 
the election results are. My hope is that the progressive 
alignment will win and that this alignment can bring about a 
democratic alliance government -- that is, one with the 
Christian Democrats, the PDS, and the Social Christians. Of 
course, the endless nonsense that Bertinotti talks confirms the 
fact that Communist Renewal has no intention of broaching the 
problems of a modern and complex society, and it is rightly 
aiming to go into opposition. And I say that this is as it 
should be. 
  [Messina] Mr. Adornato, have you ever thought that in your 
own single-candidate constituency Communist Renewal's voters 
might be tempted not to vote for you? 
  [Adornato] That may be so. But my impression is that 
Italians, including those who may incline toward Communist 
Renewal, are tired of following theories that would confine them 
to the opposition for another 40 years. 
  [Messina] What would you do if Bertinotti and [Italian 
Popular Party, PPI, deputy] Mattarella were competing in your 
constituency? Who would you vote for? 
  [Adornato] Unfortunately, I will not, we will not, have this 
choice. The real choice will be between the progressive forces 
and Berlusconi's Right. 
  [Messina] A few days ago a left-wing reader responded to the 
"manifesto" with a letter full of anger and disappointment: 
"Dear progressive forces, you have lost my vote." Did you read 
it? 
  [Adornato] Yes, and I identify closely with that citizen's 
feelings. The candidates should have been chosen differently, 
by boldly establishing a single democratic party of the 
reformists and leaving the task of democratically selecting the 
candidates for the runoff elections. However, I would like to 
ask that reader to ponder the fact that in the election we will 
have to choose between Ciampi and Berlusconi, and that every 
vote less for the progressive forces will be one vote more for 
our adversaries. 
  [Messina] [newspaper editor] Montanelli used to say, hold 
your nose and vote DC [Christian Democratic Party]. 
  [Adornato] Just a minute: I would never ask anyone to hold 
their nose. I am saying: Open your eyes and vote for us.

<F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck commentary: "NATO's Response"] </F>
  [Text] By downing four Serb combat aircraft, the Western 
alliance addressed the right signal to the Serbs. The intruders 
had been asked several times to turn away from the no-fly zone. 
They did, however, not take the combat planes seriously, just 
as the Western alliance has often been ridiculed over the past 
weeks. 
  This might have changed since yesterday's downings: The 
Bosnian Serbs know now that NATO means business. The fact that 
in this first NATO air strike on Bosnia, the AWACS planes had 
German crew members on board has answered all questions as to 
what would happen if German staff were on board radar 
reconnaissance planes in a similar case. They helped enforce UN 
Resolution 816 in a NATO military strike. 
  Thus, there is hope that all warring parties in Bosnia have 
realized that the international community will no longer watch 
the killing and blocking of aid without taking action. What 
will have to follow is an active policy of humanitarian aid on 
the part of the United Nations. 
  The time has now come to get aid convoys for the starving 
population on their way. And they will have to be forced 
through, if necessary. This is the only way the international 
community and NATO can take the initiative in hand. And this 
would be the first step on the way to achieving tangible results.

<F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck report: "Bonn Considering Involvement"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government is considering ways 
to become involved in the peace process in Bosnia. Although the 
Chancellor's Office denied reports that it was planning to send 
Bundeswehr medical staff and pioneers to Mostar, Chancellor Kohl 
said that for Bosnia one would "go to the bounds of possibility." 
  The Chancellor expressly promised logistic help for the NATO 
countries involved in the peacekeeping operations, if this is 
required. This would involve air lifts and logistic measures in 
Italy and the Adriatic. 
  In Bosnia itself, civilian relief organizations might become 
active. Together with the idea of having Mostar, besieged by 
the Croats, administrated by a German, plans have been published 
that Bundeswehr medical officers are to put the local hospital 
in order and German pioneers are to repair roads and bridges. 
  On these allegations, the Chancellor's Office says: "We do 
not have any such plans." The prompt denial has a good reason: 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe and government experts are afraid 
of a Serbian hunt for German helpers in Bosnia. "Only officials 
at conference tables could plan something like that," the 
Chancellor's Office said -- a discreet dig at the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  After all, the Defense Ministry also has a plan for German 
soldiers to be made available in the former Yugoslavia: Once 
the peace process is finally under way and no more shots are 
fired in Bosnia, Volker Ruehe might consider establishing a 
field hospital in Croatia where the injured could be treated and 
UN peacekeeping troops supplied.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN): German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today 
welcomed the results of the Brussels talks on the accession to 
the European Union of Sweden, Finland, and Austria, as well as 
the progress of negotiations with Norway, calling them a "great 
success for Europe." According to government spokesman Dieter 
Vogel, Kohl said during a cabinet meeting in Bonn today that the 
accession of these countries would go down as a major event in 
European history. All parties could be "more than satisfied" 
with the results of the talks. 
  Kohl emphasized that the German Government, which had 
spearheaded the opening of the European Community towards 
southern Europe, had a "decisive interest" in the Scandinavian 
countries and Austria becoming members. Germany's close 
cooperation with the new member states would be of great benefit 
to Germany in particular, he said.

  [Text] Brussels, March 1 (AFP) -- Finland on Tuesday [1 
March] reached agreement on conditions for joining the European 
Union [EU], German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said, paving 
the way for its membership of the Union in 1995. 
  Diplomatic sources said the Finns had obtained a last minute 
concession in the form of clauses safeguarding its market in 
preserved fruit and vegetable against saturation by foreign 
competition. 
  Talks had continued between EU and Finnish representatives 
even though the negotiations had missed their highly-publicised 
political deadline of midnight Monday. 
  The agreement followed that of Sweden earlier in the day, 
leaving Austria and Norway's terms still to be finalised. 
Finland and Sweden were seen as the least problematic 
applications. 
  Talks were continuing late Tuesday on Austria's membership. 
Norwegian negotiators, who walked out of talks earlier in the 
day, had still not returned but had indicated they were prepared 
to resume negotiations. 
  "It works with Finland, we are continuing with Austria," 
Kinkel told journalists. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes 
said EU officials hoped to reach agreement with Austria later 
Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Report by "C.G.": "Meri Laments `Appeasement' by the West"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 28 Feb -- The concern about developments in 
Russia following the release of putschists Rutskoy and 
Khasbulatov is reflected in the talks between Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel and the visitors from the Baltic states, 
Azerbaijan, and Belarus in Bonn. This Tuesday [1 March], Kinkel 
is scheduled to hold talks with Azeri Foreign Minister Hasanov 
on relations between the Asian country and Russia, Armenia, and 
Turkey. Possibilities of CSCE involvement in the settlement of 
regional conflicts should also be discussed. On Thursday, the 
Belarusian foreign minister will brief Kinkel on the relations 
within the CIS after the election of a new president in Minsk 
and the events in Moscow. In January, Kinkel invited the 
Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian foreign ministers to Bonn for 
joint talks; this meeting will take place next Wednesday. The 
invitations to Foreign Ministers Luik (Estonia), Andrejevs 
(Latvia), and Gylys (Lithuania) for consultations has to be seen 
in connection with the increasing feeling in the Baltic states 
of a threat from Russia. Even then, statements by Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who said that Russia had "fundamental 
vital interests" in the other successor states to the former 
Soviet Union, the CIS, and the Baltics, have caused some fear. 
With the foreign ministers of the Baltic countries Kinkel will 
also discuss the issue of leading their countries closer to the 
European Union [EU]. Since December, Germany has been trying to 
extend the negotiating mandate of the Brussels Commission, 
which, initially, only provided for talks on a free-trade 
agreement. The agreements should now contain at least the 
"prospects" for later EU membership, similarly to existing 
Europe agreements with other countries. 
  Estonian President Meri described the Baltics as a 
"touchstone for the European idea." In a lecture in Hamburg, 
Meri expressed his concern that the West would not realize the 
full extent of what was brewing in Russia. The West was 
confounding what was desirable with reality. Meri said: "Just 
like the West, all of us, including the Estonian people and the 
other peoples in Central and East Europe, are interested in an 
economically and socially stable Russia; however, if we look at 
the events of the past few years, we would actually have to be 
overcome by an eerie feeling that we have moved further and 
further away from this objective." Meri did not conceal his 
astonishment that the West "invited" Russian soldiers and tanks 
to Sarajevo. One has to ask oneself whether a country that is 
itself struggling with serious unsolved ethnic and ethical 
problems, could act as a credible arbiter and peacemaker in 
other countries. The ill-feeling was growing when reading one of 
the most recent documents issued by the Russian Foreign 
Ministry: "Here it says that the problem of the Russian ethnic 
groups in the neighboring countries can not be solved by Russia 
only through diplomatic means." Meri added that these Russian 
ethnic groups often settled there in the wake of the occupiers 
and after a massive deportation of the native population. One 
can only conclude from the Moscow memorandum that, if necessary, 
other means should also be used: "What these other means could 
be has been experienced in a bitter way by us, the Estonians, 
and other small nations in our recent history." 
<H5>  Fear of "Power of Order" </H5>
  In Russian foreign policy, the irrational element was 
getting 
the upper hand again, Meri said. Responsible Russian 
politicians were openly speaking of an allegedly "special role" 
of Russia, of its function as a "power of order," which the new 
Russia had to fulfill on the territory of the entire former 
Soviet Union. Yeltsin's adviser Karaganov has claimed for 
Russia the role of "first among equals" on the entire territory 
of the former Soviet empire. Meri said that one reason for his 
fears was that Russia did not admit "that, in 1940, and again in 
1944, the Baltic nations were occupied, annexed against their 
will and in violation of international law and, subsequently, 
Sovietized and Russified to the limit of their national 
existence during five decades." Deputy Russian Foreign Minister 
Krylov last week officially told the Baltic states that in 1940, 
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the Soviet Union 
"voluntarily." Meri said: "The next thing they will claim is 
that tens of thousands of Estonians -- including my family and 
myself -- `voluntarily' agreed to be deported to Siberia by the 
Soviets." 
  Meri complained that the democratic West was tending to 
follow a policy of "appeasement" toward Moscow, which, out of 
convenience, is presented as realpolitik. "Against its better 
knowledge," the West was thus making itself "an accomplice to 
Russia's imperialist forces, who think they could solve the 
enormous unsolved problems of their country by external 
expansion and by threatening their neighbors." It is true that 
the West was shocked by the statements of nationalist 
Zhirinovskiy: "Still, surprisingly, hardly anybody recognizes 
it and nobody protests when Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev 
states that the Moscow government regards the continued presence 
of Russian Forces in the former Soviet republics as desirable." 
The widespread inclination in the West to regard whoever is in 
power in Moscow -- from Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Gorbachev, or 
Yeltsin -- as irreplaceable, has led to enormous faulty 
investments and misjudgements. Meri said: "Those who really 
want to help Russia and the Russian people today must 
emphatically convince the Russian leadership that there is no 
chance for a new imperialist expansion; those who fail to do so 
will actually help the enemies of democracy in Russia and the 
other postcommunist countries." 
  The West's, and Germany's, policy was facing the crucial 
question of whether one should tolerate and finance a 
neoimperialist policy of the superpower in the East and, in the 
short term, maybe even benefit from it, or whether one wants to 
facilitate the success of democracy, freedom, responsibility, 
and peace between the Baltic Sea and the Pacific. The second 
objective can be achieved only if the West contributes strongly 
to the stability and security of the medium-sized and smaller 
countries east of the German border. Meri was referring to the 
countries of Central Europe from the Baltics to Ukraine. "If we 
manage to integrate thise belt of states into the democratic 
world, then these countries will have an exemplary effect on 
Russia." The Baltic countries wanted and had to be safely 
anchored in the West so that they could have a bridging function 
from such a firm position -- and not from a gray zone -- and 
could help the democratic forces in Russia. If, however, those 
countries, one of which is Estonia, are left to themselves and 
remain exposed without protection to Moscow's neoimperialist 
appetite, "then the price would be so high that not even all of 
Europe could pay it."

<F P=106> [Michael J. Inacker report: "First Russian Ceremony for </F>
German Fallen at Stalingrad"] 
  [Text] Moscow/Volgograd -- Icy wind streaks across a field 
35 km to the west of Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad. Thousands 
of German soldiers are buried there under frozen Russian earth. 
A simple birchwood cross, hammered into the ground only a few 
days ago, marks the field of graves for the victims of that 
battle in 1942-43, which constitutes a low point in the common 
history of both Russians and Germans. 
  On Thursday [17 February] a new chapter in relations between 
German and Russian armed forces was opened there. For the first 
time since 1945 the highest-ranking German soldier, Bundeswehr 
Inspector General Klaus Naumann, was able to honor the dead. 
And for the first time since 1945 a guard of honor consisting 
of Russian soldiers took their positions for the fallen Germans. 
In his talks in Moscow with Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, 
Naumann advocated that this ceremony take place. 
  What this means for the Russians was explained by Lieutenant 
General Vladimir Patapov, chief of staff in the Military 
District of Volgograd: "For decades we have been taught to see 
the Germans as our enemies. And now, because of the talks with 
the highest-ranking German general, we see that everything is 
quite different." 
  Major General Lev Rokhlin, commander of the corps groups in 
the Military District of Volgograd, said that he fought as a 
soldier in Afghanistan and in the Caucasus and has experienced 
suffering and death; "to the left and to the right of me my best 
friends fell. We soldiers often do not know where the just war 
ends and the political lie begins. In this Russian soil there 
are German soldiers, here against their will, because of a 
criminal political leadership. It is the simple soldiers who 
suffered and who did not do anything but follow orders. Often, 
we soldiers do not have any other choice." 
  By visiting a country whose inhabitants link German uniforms 
with the memory of suffering, Naumann has achieved more than 
some political travelers: He represented German identity and 
German interests with dignity also in a situation burdened with 
historic events. 
  In St. Petersburg (Leningrad), where 1 million people died 
during 900 days of Wehrmacht siege, Naumann wrote into the 
commemorative book of the siege memorial: "The 900 days and the 
innumerable sacrifices of, above all, the citizens of this 
heroic city must never be forgotten. However, from the graves 
there rises an admonition to us who are alive -- an admonition 
for reconciliation and an obligation for lasting peace between 
Russia and Germany." 
  Naumann's behavior made the German general's talks with 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Chief of General Staff 
Kolesnikov about other sensitive topics easier: 
  -- Naumann promised to withdraw Russian troops from Germany 
in a dignified manner to avoid any impression of a defeat. 
However, there is to be no joint event with the Western allies. 
  -- Concerning the subject of NATO's expansion to the East, 
Naumann remained tough: Russian security interests will be 
taken into consideration, but the 16 NATO members alone are the 
ones to decide about accepting new members. 
  -- In a lecture at the General Staff Academy, Naumann called 
on the Russian military leadership to finally publish its 
military doctrine adopted last autumn. The result: the Russian 
chief of General staff intends to send Naumann a copy translated 
into German in the coming weeks. 
  In addition, the inspector general achieved progress in the 
field of further development of German-Russian security policy 
relations. Naumann says that the agreement about more intensive 
German-Russian military cooperation "sets a new course." Above 
all below the command echelon, younger officers are to be 
exchanged between the two countries. As of this autumn, one 
Bundeswehr officer will go to the Russian General Staff Academy 
and three Russian officers will receive training at the 
Bundeswehr Command Academy. There are also to be visits at the 
troop level. 
  During Naumann's five-day visit the new relationship between 
Russian and German Armed Forces was demonstrated in particular 
by the fact that the German delegation was shown military 
installations that had been top secret before. In a 
snow-covered forest near Balabanov, 100 km south of Moscow, the 
bunker doors to a launch pad of the SS-18 intercontinental 
missiles opened for the Bundeswehr inspector general. 
  These are the Russians' most terrible nuclear weapons; 
having 
10 warheads each and high precision, they were destined to be 
used in a disabling strike against NATO. Naumann was shown a 
simulated launch, by which the Russians wanted to demonstrate 
that the nuclear missiles are safe in their country because they 
are coded and cannot be fired by unauthorized persons. 
  In Kubinka, 69 km from Moscow, a Russian Air Defense 
command post is hidden 20 meters underground right in the middle 
of a residential area. Naumann was the first West European 
general to be briefed on the operation and command procedures of 
Russian Air Defense. The large map projected in the darkened 
operations headquarters covered the entire area between Russia 
and France. On a board to the left all potential approaching 
flying object, their number, and their direction are registered; 
on the right the planes that can be used for interception as 
well as the airports and the relevant weather conditions are 
listed. 
  In Totskoye, 1,000 km east of Moscow, Naumann was shown the 
27th Motorized Rifle Division during an exercise -- an elite 
unit that is to participate in UN missions in the future. 
Naumann noticed weaknesses of a T-72 tank company during 
training shots. The Russian commander, Division General 
Anatoliy Sidyakin, took the German inspector general's critical 
questions with good humor. The Russian general said he is happy 
that Naumann visited in his function as Bundeswehr inspector 
general and not as inspector of his troops. 
  The extent to which the relationship between the former 
enemies has changed was demonstrated by Naumann's meeting with 
Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, who is responsible for 
armament. Kokoshin worriedly inquired about the cutbacks in the 
German defense budget, because, after all, Moscow wants to sell 
Russian high technology armament to the Germans. Kokoshin gave 
Naumann a glossy brochure: The "Military Parade" -- a catalogue 
from which in the future the supreme German Bundeswehr planner 
can order all the weapons systems he needs -- around the clock, 
if he likes.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Johannes Gerster, deputy Christian </F>
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag chairman and 
member of the Parliamentary Control Commission on Espionage, by 
unidentified announcer -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Good morning, Mr. Gerster. 
  [Gerster] Good morning. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Gerster, the above-mentioned exposure [of 
the 
two U.S. KGB spies] caused surprise throughout the world. Do 
you share that surprise? 
  [Gerster] Not at all. We knew, and of course know, that the 
KGB is still spying to the same extent, especially in Germany. 
The strange thing is that it has been split up; three 
different, and I say this in quote marks, [word indistinct] 
departments have been formed out of an originally single KGB, 
which conduct espionage both abroad and at home. 
  Efforts are being made for official contacts; there have, 
for 
example, been contacts with the Bundestag Parliamentary Control 
Commission in order to organize the secret service, shall I say, 
according to a Western model, that is, democratically and on the 
basis of a state based on the rule of law. But we know, 
incidentally, that not only Russia, but other states in East 
Europe are conducting espionage to the same extent and that, if 
you like, while the policy of detente has certainly had 
consequences for the military sphere, it has not for the 
intelligence services. 
  [Announcer] Would you like to hazard a guess as to the 
extent 
of KGB espionage here? 
  [Gerster] That is always a matter for speculation, as you 
know. If we knew everything we could put an end to this dreadful 
game. But I can say that as far as we know, there has been 
absolutely no change in the level [of espionage]. What is 
surprising is that it is not only old comrades who are, for 
example, placed in Germany as spies, but we know, for example 
from the MfS [Ministry for State Security] sphere, that is, the 
GDR State Security Ministry, that individual employees -- not 
just three out of five, but a somewhat larger number -- have for 
example gone over to the Soviet Union and have offered their 
services to the intelligence services there. That means that 
the repertoire of people prepared to spy in Russia has become 
bigger rather than smaller. 
  [Announcer] If the scope of espionage activity has therefore 
increased, can one then say that the focus of the espionage has 
switched to other spheres? 
  [Gerster] I know that another East European state, which 
really is making efforts toward democracy, directs over 50 
percent of its efforts specifically at Germany. 
  [Announcer] Which state do you mean? 
  [Gerster] I do not want to name it. The only positive thing 
from our point of view in this case is that although these 
efforts are continuing, financial resources are limited. (?As 
you know) we are making efforts for a type of security 
partnership with the East European states -- this (?concerns) 
NATO -- which naturally also has an effect on the EC. I think 
one should try -- the Germans cannot do this on their own -- to 
convene a type of conference with the East European states in 
order to hold talks and make it clear to them that there cannot, 
on the one hand, be efforts for cooperation with the EC and a 
security partnership with NATO, while simultaneously virtually 
continuing subversive actions. I think this really must be made 
an international issue and that we have every reason, especially 
as a target of these espionage efforts, [words indistinct]. 
  [Announcer] Can one assume that the targets of espionage 
have 
moved more from the military to the economic sphere? 
  [Gerster] One cannot say that. Both spheres are affected, 
whereby there were always two main pillars in East European 
espionage, economic espionage on the one hand, and on the other 
espionage in the political sphere, thus not only in the 
military, but in the overall political sphere. 
  [Announcer] Let us stay with economic espionage. Is it in 
fact still worth finding out things through espionage in the 
West, given that there are now numerous cooperation, training, 
and further qualification agreements between the East and West? 
  [Gerster] Let me put it this way. Democracy is still very 
fragile in Russia as well. What the official policies pursued 
by President Yeltsin and others are really aimed at, namely an 
opening up and real friendship with the democratic states of the 
West, has obviously not yet sunk into those who over decades saw 
us purely and simply as the enemy and are simply (?carrying on). 
It is probable that with the efforts for a market economy and 
democracy and survival in increasingly democratic conditions, 
conditions are so tense there that the spheres of classic old 
defense mechanisms, the old mistrust of all these have not yet 
been dismantled. 
  Therefore, I repeat that we have deliberately, as the 
Parliamentary Control Commission, offered our services. The 
former KGB held a conference over a year ago, when experts from 
the democratic parliaments of Germany, England, France, the 
United States, and other states were (asked?) to Moscow to 
advise them. What astonishes me is that all these good talks had 
no results at all. 
  [Announcer] Perhaps they did have the result that the 
Western states will help modernize the KGB? 
  [Gerster] Definitely not. We are not development aid workers 
in matters concerning the revamping of the Russian secret 
service. Rather we are helping --and this is a task for 
parliamentarians -- to make it clear to people that 
parliamentary control, that is transparency, is for example, the 
duty of a secret service, or at least that it is conducted at 
the very core of parliament in our country. It is necessary, 
and efforts are made to avoid arbitrary acts and mistakes in the 
secret services. Thus, it is if anything a lesson in democracy 
and not a lesson in the technicalities of intelligence activity. 
  [Announcer] You have clearly shown, Mr. Gerster, that the 
secret services of the Eastern states are still active here in 
the West. Is it not the other way round too? 
  [Gerster] First, I think the fact that states should 
(?conduct) information work on world developments is obvious. 
Second, worldwide, I should say -- the Federal Intelligence 
Service still exists after all -- but an intelligence service on 
the basis of a democratic state is not an aggressive institution 
but an information organization and continues (?to be so). 
  [Announcer] But the KGB spy in the CIA also only wanted 
information? 
  [Gerster] Well yes, your question is justified. There is a 
difference. What for example the KGB was well-known for in past 
years, that it used illegal methods -- you can be sure that that 
is not possible in a democracy that gathered information 
legally, made it available it to the government, but [word 
indistinct].... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] ...but not according to the laws 
in 
which the espionage is carried out? 
  [Gerster] Well, all right, but the democratic laws are much 
more narrow, much more strict, and much more restrictive. 
Therefore, I would prefer the Federal Intelligence Service to 
work under the laws of the Federal Republic than under Russian 
laws, with all due respect. 
  [Announcer] In view of the indignation about the exposure of 
a KGB spy in the United States, don't you think that this 
indignation is at least in part hypocritical? 
  [Gerster] I would not say that, because you can be equally 
certain that we have not placed any agents in presidential 
offices, in the office of Russian president, nor in the 
political leadership. Our acquisition of information is partly 
based on publicly available sources. The Western intelligence 
agencies have always worked differently to intelligence services 
in communist states. They should (?do) it on a different basis 
in the future. To put it in a somewhat slangy way -- the 
Federal Intelligence Service is as a rule significantly more 
harmless than the public assumes, and I say that not to absolve 
myself, but in complete awareness of what I am saying.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Peter Boross is paying a one-day 
introductory visit to Bonn in order, among other things, to make 
top German political circles aware of the fact that following 
the death of Jozsef Antall Hungarian foreign policy has not 
changed. Gyorgy Bernat reports from Bonn: 
  [Bernat] [passage omitted] Before their talks Peter Boross 
and Helmut Kohl signed a document, the only one due to be signed 
during the visit, on a new cultural cooperation framework 
agreement. It replaces an agreement which was concluded in 1977 
and which has already expired. 
  No differences have to be sorted out at today's talks in 
Bonn. In an interview in today's issue of MANNHEIMER MORGEN 
Peter Boross said that the particularly good relationship 
developed by the late prime minister and Chancellor Kohl has 
survived Antall's death. Peter Boross was quoted as saying that 
he has not come to Germany with requests. However, he thinks 
that Hungary should have the greater advantage from 
Hungarian-German relations since the federal republic is the 
stronger economic partner. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hungary intends to submit its application for EU 
[European Union] membership in April, with parliament's 
approval, Prime Minister Peter Boross said in Bonn. In the 
second half of the year Germany, as the president of the EU at 
the time, will put the extension of the organization on the 
agenda. Chancellor Kohl considers it a wise decision that 
Hungary wants to submit its application to the EU already in the 
first half of the year. Helmut Kohl met the press after having 
a two-hour discussion with Prime Minister Peter Boross in Bonn. 
  The Hungarian prime minister rules out the possibility of 
any 
conflict similar to the one in the former Yugoslavia evolving 
between Hungary and its neighbors because of the nationalities. 
Peter Boross pointed out in Bonn that Hungary observed the UN 
sanctions against Yugoslavia despite the fact that it had so far 
suffered a loss of 1.5 billion dollars because of them, and it 
still could not see greater international willingness for 
compensation.

<F P=106> [Article by "bb": "The Keating Government Expects More </F>
German Investment"] 
  [Text] Melbourne -- Even if Australia now considers itself 
to be an active member of the Southeast Asian community of 
countries, this new political and economic orientation should 
not be pursued at the expense of traditional relations with 
Europe. That is the impression that Lorenz Schomerus, head of 
the Foreign Economic Policy Department at the Federal Economics 
Ministry, obtained during talks with representatives of the 
Labor government in Canberra. 
  "It was clear that Australia wants to have equal relations 
with the main players," said the Bonn-based official. Following 
the German-Australian economic and political consultations in 
Canberra, an annual forum that the two governments agreed to 
hold in 1988, Schomerus assessed German-Australian economic 
relations as "good, sound, and free of problems." Germany's 
restrictive policy on the import of coal constitutes a temporary 
problem. 
  The Australian Government repeated its wish to Schomerus 
that 
Germany invest more in Australia and, above all, use the 
Antipodean continent as a springboard for activities in Asia. 
"The country is a good location for companies, people are 
well-trained and conscientious, and that also applies to 
management. All these things are positive," explained the 
official in a conversation with HANDELSBLATT in Melbourne. 
  Speaking in Canberra, Schomerus drew attention to the Kohl 
government's new concept for Southeast Asia, which "is geared 
toward encouraging German companies, including small and 
medium-sized ones, to become active in the region." The 
ministerial director noted that the new Southeast Asia concept 
that Schomerus explained in Canberra, setting out details that 
had not been provided before, was noted with interest by the 
Australian Government. There was also a feeling of satisfaction 
in Canberra, because one could see that a country as important 
economically as Germany was consciously looking to the Asian 
Pacific region. 
  The Australian Government noted with regret that the planned 
visit by Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert had been called 
off, reported Schomerus. Australia has one of the most 
competitive agricultural sectors in the world, and Canberra had 
many questions to address to Borchert. Following the decline in 
German exports to Australia over the past few years, during his 
talks in Canberra, the minister was able to point to "a new 
upward trend in exports covering the entire range of sectors in 
which Germany performs well, from automobiles to machine tools." 
  The significance of German-Australian consultations extends 
well beyond the two countries' bilateral affairs. Australia is 
playing an increasingly active, leading role in multilateral 
organizations. Bonn and Canberra are generally on the same 
wavelength with regard to economic policy issues. Schomerus 
said: "This means that there are possibilities for pursuing 
matters of joint interest in international forums. The most 
important reason for regular consultations between Bonn and 
Canberra is to discuss how the world economy is developing and 
what we can do jointly to ensure that things proceed in the 
right direction."

<F P=106> [Report by Eugen Georg Schwarz: "Scharping Takes the Lead"] </F>
  [Text] The chancellor talked for one-and-a-half hours to 
the delegates of the federal Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
congress, who were listening raptly. He presented himself in a 
fighting mood, certain of his victory. For 12 minutes, applause 
roared in the Congress Center in Hamburg. However, only the 
Political Compass poll in March will show whether, with this 
brilliant speech, he managed to put an end to the opinion poll 
jeers in the country, which continued to swell in February. 
  Even though the proportion of voters who would vote for the 
chancellor and the CDU remained unchanged at 34 percent compared 
with January, the results of the poll conducted by Basis 
Research for FOCUS show: The water that is streaming into the 
government ship through a hole will soon be up to the captain's 
neck. 
  It is a phenomenon how Rudolf Scharping, to whom there is no 
alternative, manages to put the "chancellor of unification" into 
a corner like a useless umbrella, even though he himself still 
lacks profile and is skillfully hiding his lack of competence in 
material issues: Only 23.8 percent of the Germans (in January 
29 percent) would vote for Helmut Kohl if they had the 
opportunity to elect the chancellor directly. Rudolf Scharping, 
who is obviously considered as some sort of radiant person and 
messiah, for the first time easily jumps over the 50-percent 
threshold in this comparison: 52.4 percent of the voters would 
like to see him as the future head of government. 
  However, the most alarming result of this FOCUS poll for 
Kohl 
is proved by those who are still undecided as to whom they are 
going to vote for. In January, 22 percent of those polled 
answered the question "Who would master the most important 
political problems and tasks best?" with "I do not know." Four 
weeks later, this proportion has plummeted to 14.5 percent. At 
the same time, the number of those who considered a federal 
government headed by the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] most suitable to solve the problems rose from 39 to 46.3 
percent. On the other hand, the proportion of voters who 
favored the CDU remained unchanged at 24 percent. 
  Higher taxes, rising gasoline prices, an increasing number 
of 
unemployed, imminent zero wage rounds, and the disaster of the 
nursing-care insurance are probably items on the opinion bill. 
  If the Germans did not have to elect the Bundestag, but 
could 
chose the composition of the federal government as they like, 
the next chancellor would certainly be Rudolf Scharping. A 
total of 34.2 percent of those polled by FOCUS want a coalition 
government headed by the SPD; only 15.7 percent want one headed 
by the CDU. A total of 25.7 percent would prefer a coalition of 
the CDU, the Christian Social Union [CSU], and the SPD. 
  Helmut Kohl can turn the results around and whitewash as he 
likes: The Social Democrats are nowadays overtaking his party 
and his government in all fields regarding the acceptance of 
their competence -- apart from one exception. In economic 
policy there are still 36 percent of Germans who think that a 
CDU-headed government can do more than one headed by the SPD 
(33.8 percent). However, in this field, too, the SPD is in the 
process of replacing the CDU. In January the ratio was still 
38:30. 
  In the meantime, more Germans have come to the conclusion 
that internal security, too, is better dealt with by the SPD. 
While at the beginning of the year the CDU/CSU Federal 
Government was narrowly ahead in the competence competition by 
29:28, in February it has fallen behind at 30:31. This change 
in the trend can be explained only by the rejection of tougher 
measures against crime by the Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP]. 
  In all other political questions the majority of those 
polled 
have expected Scharping and his party to give the better answers 
for many months and no longer Kohl's and Kinkel's CDU/CSU-FDP 
coalition. 
  The FDP, the junior partner not only in terms of size, are 
shrinking in the voters' favor and come dangerously close to the 
5-percent threshold. Polls still give it 8.5 percent of 
secondary votes at the next Bundestag elections. However, the 
doubts about its potency as a party that is capable of ruling 
are rising. FOCUS also asked about this capability. The result 
is somber for the coalition; however, it is not flattering for 
the opposition either (0 percent = completely incapable of 
ruling; 100 percent -- fully capable of ruling): SPD 62.4 
percent, CDU 56.1 percent, CSU 48.4 percent, FDP 37.6 percent, 
and Greens 30 percent. 
  The march of the coalition into ruin (even though still only 
in public opinion polls) cannot be stopped by the government 
team, at least not at the moment, because 40.7 percent of 
Germans believe that Scharping can send the better team into the 
race. Kohl's "lost bunch" only gets 25.7 percent in the favor 
of the soon "interactive" audience. Even more devastating, 
42.4:17.8 percent is the ratio in Kohl's landscapes in the 
German east, which are flourishing a bit later. 
  Despite the self-confident whistling in Hamburg, which is to 
hide one's fear of the darkness in the basement -- there is no 
ray of light in sight for the courageous, steadfast men around 
the black giant [Kohl]. 
  However, the February poll of FOCUS still gives a little 
consolation: The common fear shown by the "established" parties 
of the numerous groups and small parties that want to run for 
the Bundestag elections is increasingly shown to be unjustified. 
Only 2 percent of those polled -- a figure that has remained 
almost stable for months -- would vote for the "others." Only 
the Republikaner (3.5 percent) and the Party of Democratic 
Socialism (4 percent) could get close to the 5-percent 
threshold. Even though the popularity values for the Instead 
Party and the Association of Free Citizens are surprisingly 
high, so far they do not have the slightest chance of entering 
the next Bundestag. 
  Whether this will change will be decided by the CDU/CSU, the 
SPD, the FDP, and the Greens. If they manage to contribute 
their respective profiles to the election campaign, one need not 
fear a fragmentation in the next Bundestag. However, achieving 
one's own profile is obviously the problem. Asked how united or 
how disunited the individual parties are on the central 
political issues, the answers were the following (0 percent = 
completely disunited; 100 percent -- completely united): CDU 
53.4 percent, CSU 53.7 percent, SPD 54.8 percent, FDP 44,8 
percent, and Greens 41.2 percent. 
  Long live the small difference.

  [Text] Karlsruhe (DDP/ADN) -- The former Berlin SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] deputy Bodo Thomas and his wife, 
Helga, who has been an SPD member at Berlin's house of deputies 
since 1989, have been charged with spying for the former GDR. 
The federal prosecutor's office said in Karlsruhe today that 
the 62-year-old Bodo Thomas, who was a member of the house of 
deputies between 1971 and 1989, supplied the Ministry for State 
Security (MfS) with information from the Berlin parliament and 
SPD sources. Thomas was an SPD specialist in matters concerning 
Germany and Berlin. His wife, whose immunity as a deputy was 
lifted last year, is alleged to have helped Thomas and covered 
for him. Both accused, who deny the allegations against them, 
are at liberty, the office said.

  [Text] Duesseldorf (DDP/ADN) -- The Duesseldorf Higher 
Regional Court today sentenced former GDR spy Johanna Olbrich to 
two years, six months imprisonment for secret service activity. 
Frau Olbrich worked for the FDP [Free Democratic Party] in 
various posts, and spied on the party for the former GDR for 16 
years until 1985, under the codename Sonja Lueneburg. She 
worked, among other things, for Martin Bangemann, the former 
German economics minister and present EC Commissioner. 
  Before the verdict was pronounced, Frau Olbrich said she 
expected to get a prison sentence. "Those who get involved in 
work of this nature have to take the consequences," she told 
journalists with obvious calm.

<F P=106> [Wolfgang Gast report: "Border Eavesdrops for the Office"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- The Federal Border Guard [BGS] is at 
least to some extent an unknown quantity. This applies 
particularly to the unit that bears the name "Communications 
Group," which, it was recently revealed, has been cooperating 
with the Cologne Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution [BfV]. In the draft amendment to the BGS Law, the 
government has admitted for the first time that the 
Communications Group has been carrying out eavesdropping 
operations for the Cologne-based bumblers as part of 
"interagency assistance." This concerns a practice that is to 
receive a new legal basis as a result of the amendment. One of 
the justifications advanced in the government draft is that BGS 
"support for the BfV in the field of communications technology" 
is used in uncovering secret service communications activities 
being conducted by other countries. 
  However, it is also of significance in the surveillance of 
foreign terrorist groups. The BfV needs the BGS in order to 
establish whether right- or left-wing extremists groups are 
seeking "to intercept security agency radio communications and 
identify frequencies." That is apparently only half the truth. 
  People who are well informed about the BGS report that their 
eavesdropping operations are not confined to requests from the 
BfV. The "Communications Group," which comes under the authority 
of the Border Security Presidium West in Bonn, is also supposed 
to conduct operations of its own -- it is also supposed to work 
for the Federal German Intelligence Service. The results of the 
operations are not only passed on to the appropriate services in 
Pullach and Cologne, but are also used by the BGS itself. This 
means that in practice, the BGS violates the separation of the 
police and secret services, which is rooted in the constitution, 
on almost on a daily basis. 
  Within the BGS itself, the "Communications Group" is 
considered an autonomous unit. The technical facilities of the 
group, which is based in Swisttal-Heimerzheim, are described as 
being very modern and eavesdropping operations could be 
conducted "as far as the Urals." The terse justification is 
"border security operations." So, some questions remain open, 
such as whether the BGS has recently started ensuring the 
security of borders in the Urals.

<F P=106> [Report by "ls": "Is Berlin Facing a Narcotics Wave?"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Police experts see a new wave 
of drugs approaching the German capital. So far, there have 
been 8,000 to 9,000 heroin or cocaine addicts in Berlin, 
according to official estimates. Says an investigator: "I am 
sure that in the future the large East European dealers will use 
the distribution network for illegal cigarettes to sell hard 
drugs." 
  There is also a new route for smuggling drugs into the 
capital -- the West African route. The drugs come from Ghana 
via Zurich to Berlin. Since the end of last year the drug 
investigators have been watching this trend. The drug couriers 
swallow condoms filled with drugs, so-called containers. Then 
they fly to Europe and report to their contacts. At the end of 
1993 alone the investigators caught four couriers from Ghana 
with forged passports. According to findings by the criminal 
police, the hot goods are partly produced in West Africa. 
However, South American cartels, too, use Ghana as an interim 
storage site for transports to Germany. Behind the African 
gangs of smugglers there are mostly old tribal ties with a 
strict hierarchy and their own language. Last year Berlin drug 
investigators seized 15 kg of heroin and 35 kg of cocaine. In 
1992 they caught 12.3 kg of heroin and 26.5 kg of cocaine.

<F P=106> [Interview with IG-Metall Chairman Klaus Zwickel by an </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: 
"IG-Metall Chief: We Do Not Want to Ruin the Economy With 
Strikes"] 
  [Text] [BILD] What result do you expect from the strike 
ballot? 
  [Zwickel] I expect overwhelming approval for the strike. 
Some months ago approval was still not so great. Since then it 
has increased constantly. 
  [BILD] Why? 
  [Zwickel] This is primarily due to the employer's blocking 
attitude and to the fact that the working people have realized 
how important binding wage contracts are, because they have 
oriented their plans for life toward that. The employers want 
clearly to worsen these contracts by canceling them at the 
expense of the employees. And now the working people say: Not 
with us! 
  [BILD] Is the strike assuming political dimensions? 
  [Zwickel] We want to limit the strike. We do not want to 
ruin the economy with strikes. With the strike ballot in Lower 
Saxony and the possibility of expanding it to the area of the 
"western coast," we want to make it clear that we will limit the 
conflict regionally. 
  However, if the employers respond with lock-outs in other 
areas and if, at the beginning of the super election year, the 
shameful Article 116 of the Labor Promotion Law -- which the 
Federal Government wanted -- for the first time leads to 
hundreds of thousands of people outside a strike district being 
turned into the streets without financial support, then we will 
have a large-scale conflict with political dimensions. 
  [BILD] If the employers' chief negotiator now calls you and 
asks: Could the two of us meet for breakfast at some time and 
try to find a solution.... 
  [Zwickel] I prefer to breakfast with my wife. But joking 
apart: Readiness for negotiations alone is insufficient. An 
offer must be put on the table. We want to reach a compromise 
as quickly as possible. This must be done during the first two 
weeks of the strike in Lower Saxony. If this is not done, there 
will be strikes in two wage areas after the second strike ballot. 
  [BILD] And what if nothing happens then, either? 
  [Zwickel] Then we want to wait and see. However, I think 
that there are not just firebrands among the employers but also 
people with a sense of responsibility. If this is not so, the 
strikes must continue until a compromise is found. 
  [BILD] What is your goal? 
  [Zwickel] We want safe employment and are also willing to 
have wage increases included in this calculation. 
  [BILD] But the economy is in a bad state.... 
  [Zwickel] We have made concessions to the employers in many 
fields. However, they are practically forcing us to strike. 
  [BILD] How full are your coffers? 
  [Zwickel] They are full enough for us to be able to finance 
the strike. However, we cannot finance lock-outs. 
  [BILD] How do you, as IG-Metall chief, feel before a strike? 
  [Zwickel] I am aware of my special responsibility. I am 
very worried about the employers' likely decision to impose 
lock-outs. Then the people's behavior might become 
uncontrollable. 
  When hundreds of thousands are locked out, there is the 
danger that they will no longer follow their trade union. I am 
worried about the spontaneous individual reactions that develop 
if people want to get into their companies and are prevented 
from doing so.

upswing and many thousands of unemployed at short notice. I

finally approach each other and agree on flexible contracts, 
tailor-made for the different branches, regions, and problems of 
the companies. Think about the fact that we are all sitting in 
the same boat. I tell the helmsmen of the employers and trade 
unions: Either we want to reach the shore together or we will 
all sink."

<F P=106> [Interview with Oskar Lafontaine, deputy chairman of the </F>
Social Democratic Party of Germany, by Einar Koch; place and 
date not given: "Lafontaine: `Lower Wages Mean More 
Unemployed'"] 
  [Text] [Koch] The wage dispute in the civil service and 
the metal industry is escalating. Is there a threat to social 
peace? 
  [Lafontaine] When it is a question of social peace, nobody 
should play with fire. Therefore, reason is required from all 
sides -- from both employers and trade unions -- in the 
collective negotiations. 
  Everyone knows that a compromise must be finally achieved. 
Therefore, I am appealing to both sides of industry: Return to 
the negotiating table. Move your positions closer to one other 
and achieve a reasonable compromise! 
  [Koch] The employers are calling for wage cuts. Will we 
reduce unemployment in this way? 
  [Lafontaine] No. General wage cuts and zero-wage rounds do 
not fit into the economic landscape: They would further weaken 
private consumption and increase unemployment even more. 
  After the increase in rates and taxes in the past few years, 
the breaking-point has been exceeded for the majority of 
employees. Rents are increasing. Some families hardly know any 
longer how they are to pay for their children's school outings. 
  General wage cuts and zero-wage rounds cannot be socially 
justified either. They would result in pension cuts for the 
first time in 1995. 
  [Koch] The trade unions are calling for shorter working 
hours and the employers want us to work longer hours again.... 
  [Lafontaine] There are 4 million people registered as 
unemployed in Germany. Therefore, it is precisely now that we 
need collective bargaining policies that are oriented to 
employment. This includes a fairer distribution of work and 
incomes. In the Volkswagen company, both sides of industry 
showed how jobs can be secured and mass dismissals be prevented 
by new ways. 
  Finally, the Federal Government also wants more part-time 
work. Some years ago, Kohl still rejected it by calling it 
"stupid, absurd, and silly."

<F P=106> [Report by "Stue.": "Stihl: Germany Gaining Ground Again"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 22 Feb -- According to Hans Peter Stihl, 
president of the Federation of German Chambers of Industry and 
Commerce [DIHT], the efforts to increase Germany's position as 
an economic center are showing the first positive effects. "The 
partly real and partly imaginary sick man, which is how our 
neighbors sometimes perceive our country, is beginning to gain 
ground again," Stihl said at the annual reception on the eve of 
the DIHT general assembly in Bonn. 
  Stihl said that the overall image has been lightened by the 
positive economic signals from the United States, Latin America, 
and Southeast Asia. Foreign demand was gradually increasing, and 
in some branches the order books are becoming fuller again, 
while domestic demand was benefiting from the diminishing 
tendency to price increases. Germany was seeking and finding 
new paths to keep its position in the increasingly stiffening 
international competition and to overcome the structural crisis, 
Stihl said. Due to the high public debts of almost 2 billion 
German marks [DM], it is still necessary to keep spending low. 
Wage agreements must not be concluded for those who still have 
work without solidarity with those looking for jobs. More 
permeability and competition are necessary in the education 
system. Moreover, "naive debates" about modern technology must 
no longer be conducted. People must cease taking advantage of 
the state as a self-service market, Stihl said. "There is no 
longer a balance between the hunt for individual advantage and 
the support for the commonweal in Germany." 
  As official speaker at the DIHT annual reception, French 
Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery expressed his support for 
the German-French partnership and for European monetary union. 
For more than 10 years, France has pursued a policy of 
stability and is more than ever ready to put monetary union into 
practice. Alphandery pleaded for a more resolute political 
commitment to reach progress regarding the convergence in the 
European national economies. The common struggle against rising 
unemployment was of preeminent importance, the French minister 
said.

<F P=106> [Article by "bag": "Western Industry Now Believes in </F>
Upturn: Mood in the East Is Rather Subdued"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- In January, fewer west German 
companies reported that business was bad compared to December. 
According to the latest Ifo economic climate test, the prospects 
for the next six months are better than they have been in a long 
time. The situation in the east is different; industry there 
considers the situation and prospects to be much worse. 
  The only point on which companies in both parts of Germany 
agree is that they see increasing hopes of higher exports. 
<H5>  Industry in Western Germany </H5>
  On the basis of the reports for its monthly test, the 
Munich-based Ifo Economic Research Institute has concluded that 
in the old laender, more orders were received than a month ago. 
While output remained the same, it was possible to somewhat 
reduce stocks. Hardly any companies are considering cutting back 
on production. Prices remained stable. 
  The situation regarding producer goods worsened again, but 
the outlook for the future of exports improved. In engineering 
above all, production plans indicate that the recession is 
subsiding. The signs are that there will also be an improvement 
in the precision mechanics and optical instruments sectors. 
Manufacturers of producer goods in the electrical engineering 
sector remained skeptical, and manufacturers of delivery 
vehicles and trucks complained about declining demand. 
  The situation is not quite as bad as it was for 
manufacturers 
of preproducts, and prospects were better for the chemical 
industry above all. In the case of hard goods, business remains 
bad, although there is more confidence about the future. 
Manufacturers of hard goods state that the current trend is a 
downward one. 
<H5>  Industry in Eastern Germany </H5>
  Orders for manufacturing industry in the new laender just 
reached last month's level and no more. Companies continue to 
complain about poor sales, difficulties with finance, and poor 
technical equipment. 
  In the case of producer goods, the situation has grown worse 
and expectations are more pessimistic. Only the shipbuilding 
industry is satisfied. The food, drinks, and tobacco industries 
are still experiencing a recession, and for the first time since 
1993, those who take a negative view are in the majority. 
  In the primary commodities and capital goods sectors, every 
fifth plant reports good prospects, but states that the overall 
situation is as bad as the end of the year. The consumer good 
sector described the situation as "almost satisfactory." 
Confidence regarding the future has somewhat declined. 
<H5>  The Construction Industry </H5>
  There is confidence in the construction industry in both the 
old and the new laender. In the west, orders have somewhat 
increased compared to the previous year, from 2.9 months to 3.1 
months. The upward trend primarily stems from surface 
engineering, from housing construction to be more precise. 
Nothing has changed in the construction of industrial 
facilities, and the state is placing fewer orders. 
  In eastern Germany, the construction situation has worsened 
because of seasonal factors. Nevertheless, almost two-thirds of 
respondents were satisfied. The next six months appear to be 
more positive, and 20 percent are counting on good business. 
Capacity utilization stands at 67 percent, which is once again 
above the previous year's level. Companies in the surface 
construction field are pleased and optimism is spreading. In 
the civil engineering sector, negative views prevailed once 
again. In the prefabricated construction sector, the situation 
has become much worse once again, although a much more positive 
view is being taken of the future. 
<H5>  The Wholesale Trade </H5>
  The situation is once again bad for wholesalers in the west, 
in January, just as in December, they failed to obtain the same 
level of sales as a year ago. The sector also expects demand to 
decline over the next six months. Only sales of hard goods were 
described as less disheartening, with only 20 percent of 
companies registering fewer sales than a year ago, compared to 
40 percent in December. 
  The business climate for the wholesale trade in the east 
grew much worse. Almost one-fifth of companies still want to 
reduce personnel over the next few months. However, there is a 
noticeable increase in confidence regarding future expectations, 
and the optimism is primarily based on the prospects for sales 
of raw materials, semi, capital goods, and food, drink and 
tobacco products. In the case of wholesalers of consumer goods, 
those that have been the worst affected are in clothing and 
footwear: 70 percent recorded lower sales than a year ago. 
<H5>  The Retail Trade </H5>
  Consumer sales were bad throughout Germany in January. In 
the west, they were still somewhat more negative than in 
December and were "poor once again" in eastern Germany. Sales 
were markedly below the previous year's levels. To keep the 
decline in perspective, it should be borne in mind that this 
year many end of season sales will not take place until February. 
  In the west, retail sales of consumer goods were somewhat 
less worse than a month ago and sales were not quite so far 
below the levels of a year ago. Sales were disappointing for 
hardware, glass, porcelain, ceramics, lighting, electrical 
goods, including audiovisual equipment. Sales were also 
unsatisfactory for watches, jewelry, and office equipment, 
although in the case of the latter, there are signs of an 
improvement. In addition to the furniture trade, the automobile 
sector also reported an improvement, although negative views 
were still in the majority. Following a drop in demand in 
January, retail traders in the food, drinks, and tobacco sectors 
now expect demand to pick up. 
  In the east German retail trade sector, the situation for 
employees will continue to worsen: As in the previous month, 
one-third of companies want to reduce staffing levels.

<F P=106> [Article by "adh": "Declining Real Incomes"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- The households of west German 
blue-collar workers were hardest hit by the low wage increases 
and the relatively high inflation rate of 4.2 percent last year: 
Their real net incomes declined for the first time in 12 years 
by up to 1.6 percent. 
  As the president of the Federal Statistical Office, Hans 
Guenther Merk, stated, the white-collar workers got away with a 
stagnation of their net incomes. The situation in the new 
laender was much more favorable. Net wages there increased by 
up to 8 percent. 
  Thus, the adaptation of incomes to the western level 
continued in the east, Merk stressed. Miners and workers in 
surface and underground engineering achieved the biggest 
increase. They reached 77 and 74 percent of the wages of their 
west German counterparts. In the industry, the wages in the new 
laender reached 66 percent of the western level, and in trade 
and the banking and insurance industry, they reached 68 percent. 
The gross income per month of the blue and white-collar workers 
in the east rose by 17 percent to 3,000 German marks [DM]. The 
average gross income in western Germany was DM4,500, which is 
3.8 percent more than in the previous year. 
  As the Federal Statistical Office reported, prices in the 
old 
laender were 3.3 percent higher than one year ago. According to 
preliminary calculations, inflation is increasing more slowly 
than in the past: In January, the rate was still 3.5 percent. 
From January to February, the inflation rate increased by 0.2 
percent, whereas the increase was still 0.9 percent in the 
previous month. Whether it will be possible to achieve an annual 
inflation rate of 3 percent or a rate with the figure 2 in front 
the decimal point this year will depend on the increase of 
prices for public and private services and on the development of 
the rents, Merk stressed. 
  At 4.2 percent, the average annual inflation rate last year 
reached the highest level since 1982.

<F P=106> [Article by "sch": "Job Cuts To Continue in 1994"] </F>
  [Text] Nuremberg, 24 Feb -- The economy in western Germany 
expects a further 2-percent reduction in employment between the 
middle of 1993 and the middle of 1994. This absolute reduction 
of 580,000 employees will, however, not increase unemployment by 
the same percentage, because retirements, hidden reserves, and 
domestic policy measures will partly compensate for the job 
losses. 
  This is the result of a sample inquiry by the Institute for 
Labor Market and Occupational Research and Infratest Social 
Research on "employment trends," which was carried out for the 
first time in the middle of 1993 in 4,500 enterprises and public 
administrative bodies. Still, employment will not decrease in 
all branches and sizes of enterprises, and not in all 1.6 
million enterprises in western Germany by the middle of 1994, 
Bernhard Jagoda, president of the Federal Labor Office, said in 
a news conference. 
  According to his statements, 175,000 enterprises, which 
account for almost one-third of all employees, are intending to 
reduce their staff by 0.95 million by the middle of 1994. At 
the same time, 230,000 enterprises, which offer one-seventh of 
all jobs, are planning to increase their work force by 0.44 
million. Approximately three-quarters of all enterprises 
accounting for more than half of all employees are expecting 
stable employment figures by the middle of 1994. 
  Enterprises with decreasing employment exist in all 
branches. 
With the exception of credit institutions, insurance companies, 
the liberal professions, and regional and local authorities, the 
share of enterprises that expect their employment figures rather 
to diminish is over 10 percent. Losses are particularly high in 
the agricultural sector, the manufacturing industry, and the 
health sector. 
  The slump in employment has mainly been caused by staff 
reductions in large enterprises. Enterprises with a work force 
of more than 5,000 intend to employ 11 percent fewer employees 
than in the middle of 1992. Hopes regarding employment have to 
be pinned especially on small enterprises. Small enterprises 
with up to 50 employees in the service sector is the group that 
least has to expect job cuts in 1994. 
  In his news conference, Jagoda stated that a massive 
reduction of jobs alone will not solve the problems of the 
enterprises. The willingness to be innovative and the ability 
to modernize structures will be increasingly important for a 
positive economic and employment development and the securing of 
economic centers and jobs. Here, the survey produced the 
following result: On an average, 26 percent of the enterprises 
stated that they improved and further developed their products 
in the past two years. This rate rises to 58 percent in the 
case of enterprises with more than 500 employees. Regardless of 
enterprise size, an average 25 percent of enterprises added new 
products or services to their offer for which there is already a 
market. Eleven percent of all enterprises developed completely 
new products and services, for which a new market has to first 
be created. All in all, 40 percent of enterprises in western 
Germany made one of the above-mentioned innovative efforts in 
the past two years. 
  Despite the general reduction of jobs, there is still a 
significant offer of vacancies. A total of 260,000 enterprises, 
or more than one-sixth of all, was looking for a total of 
492,000 workers in mid-1993 for employment as early as possible. 
A total of 187 [number as published] enterprises wanted to 
increase their work force by 347,000 people at a later time. 
Jagoda complained that only about one-third of these vacancies 
were reported to the labor offices, seizing the opportunity to 
plead for closer trusting cooperation between enterprises and 
the labor offices in the future. About half of the entire offer 
were vacancies for skilled workers, and more than one-third for 
qualified employees. A total of 8 percent of all enterprises in 
western Germany did not find applicants for their vacancies.

<F P=106> [Report by "froe/old.": "West German Consortium Takes Over </F>
Veag and Lusatia Coal Fields"] 
  [Text] Bonn/Berlin -- The Trust Agency and energy supply 
enterprises (EVU) in western Germany after more than two years 
of negotiations reached agreement on the privatization of the 
east German electricity enterprise VEAG AG and the Lusatia coal 
fields. This was stated by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, 
of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] after the 20th 
round of talks in the Chancellor's Office on the east German 
economy in Bonn on Monday [28 February]. Thus, the way has been 
paved for the investment of tens of billions of German marks 
[DM]. Regarding the announcement that the French oil concern 
Elf Aquitaine will partly withdraw from the large Leuna 
refinery, Bonn insists on the fulfillment of the contract. 
  Both the Laubag brown coal enterprise and the VEAG 
electricity enterprise will be taken over by a west German 
consortium, which, apart from the major energy suppliers, RWE 
[Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk], Bayernwerk, 
Preussen Elektra, also includes various smaller electricity 
companies, and, in the case of Laubag, the RWE subsidiary 
Rheinbraun. Friedhelm Gieske, head of the RWE concern, said 
that the price for Laubag was DM2.1 billion. In the year 2000, 
Gieske expects a production of 50-55 million tonnes per year. 
The current work force of 12,000 will, however, have to shrink 
by another 4,000 by then. 
  According to board member Klaus Schucht, the sale of VEAG AG 
will bring a cash value of DM8 billion into the Trust Agency 
purse. In the new laender, the VEAG intends to boost the output 
of the existing power plants by 4,000 megawatt (MW), while there 
are plans for the construction of new brown coal-fired plants 
with an output of 4,000 MW. In the eyes of Bayernwerk head Otto 
Majewski, the participation in VEAG, which has been demanded by 
laender such as Saxony and Brandenburg, is only a "fictitious 
problem." The enterprises, however, are against a participation 
in the capital, while Rexrodt did nor rule it out. Trust Agency 
board member Schucht proposed a participation by the laender in 
the board of supervisors or in advisory councils. Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has urged a solution of the problem by 
the end of March. 
  While the privatization of Laubag and VEAG should be 
concluded by the middle of the year, the future of the large 
Leuna refinery is still uncertain after Elf Aquitaine announced 
that it would reduce its two-thirds share, to which it is bound 
by a contract, to some 30-40 percent. The Federal Government, 
however, strongly insists on fulfillment of the contract. Only 
then could one talk about new industrial partners, Rexrodt said. 
He could not imagine that Elf would resign from the contract it 
concluded. 
  The news conference did, however, lay bare differences of 
opinion between Rexrodt and Schucht. While the minister 
regarded the resignation of Elf from the contract only as a 
theoretical possibility, Schucht said that a withdrawal "would 
not surprise us." Schucht said that the Trust agency would claim 
some DM1.5 billion in damages. 
  Schucht is obviously planning to initiate negotiations with 
British Petroleum to have a new investor in stock if Elf 
Aquitaine really were to resign from the Leuna refinery project. 
According to information received by SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the 
Trust Agency has already sent a letter to Elf pointing out that 
the Berlin agency is not intending to make any further 
concessions to the French. 
<H5>  "Declaration of Divorce" </H5>
  An insider from the Federal Government has described this 
document as a "declaration of divorce." Whether British 
Petroleum, which made an offer for the modernization of the 
existing refinery in Leuna even during the tender procedure, is 
still interested, is dubious. Originally, the new refinery was 
to go into operation in the middle of 1996. Elf's partner, the 
Thyssen Handelsunion AG, of Duesseldorf, will stick to the 
contract, but, according to press reports, will not not increase 
its stake for the time being.

  [Text] Berlin -- Owing to environmental protection 
measures and production cuts, pollution has decreased 
considerably in the new laender since unification. According to 
a report by the Halle Economic Research Institute, the average 
production of dust and sulfur dioxide decreased by 50 percent in 
areas with high pollution, and by a third in areas less exposed 
to pollution. It was, above all, the conversion of coal-fired 
heating systems to oil and gas- fired ones in more than 1 
million private households that has caused this positive effect. 
  In the electricity sector the funds for fighting dust, 
sulfur, and the disposal of ash, gypsum, and water are expected 
to increase to 20-30 percent of the basic investment. Of the 28 
billion German marks of investment in plants expected by 1997, 
some 40 percent will, however, have to be used for repairing the 
power network.

<F P=106> [Article by "ban": "Former Greens Politician Heads German </F>
Liaison Office in Northern Iraq"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 23 Feb -- Mr. Walde, former federal manager 
of the Greens, will be the head of an FRG liaison office in 
northern Iraq. The "German Humanitarian Aid" office -- with its 
seat in Irbil -- is supposed to coordinate relief operations and 
to establish contacts with local authorities. After his 
departure from the Greens, Walde worked for the Caritas 
organization, the Workers' Samaritan League, and other 
organizations in the Kurdish areas of Iraq. The Foreign 
Ministry appointed him to his new position, which he will take 
up at the beginning of March. Walde was the federal manager of 
the Greens until the party left the Bundestag in 1990. At that 
time he was counted among the party's left wing. 
  On behalf of the International Association for Human Rights 
in Kurdistan, Lower Saxony's Justice Minister Alm-Merk (Social 
Democratic Party of Germany) called on the Federal Government on 
Wednesday [23 February] not to supply Turkey with weapons from 
the stocks of the former National People's Army (NVA) any more. 
The Federal Government must also make a contribution to having 
the Turkish authorities investigate human rights violations 
against the Kurds. A statement by the Association recalls that 
UN bodies have accused the Turkish Government of deliberate and 
systematic torture of Kurds. In 1993, too, the Kurdish press 
was the target of "state repression." There were a total of 626 
"extrajudicial executions," 392 villages were destroyed, and 
almost 380 magazines and newspapers were impounded. 
  The human rights organization also criticized the acts of 
violence committed by the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). The 
PKK must stick to its "basic principles, which have been set 
down internationally." The statement calls on the United 
States, Germany, France, and Great Britain to condemn the 
violations of human rights in Turkey and to make political, 
military, and economic aid to Turkey dependent on the 
observation of human rights.

<F P=106> [Article by Michael J. Inacker: "NATO Official Criticizes </F>
Bonn's Arms Policy"] 
  [Text] A high-ranking member of the German NATO mission in 
Brussels severely criticized the self-restraint of German arms 
policy, particularly as it is being exercised by the Foreign 
Office. 
  In his internal annual report for 1993, Elmer Rauch, 
official 
of the German NATO mission and in charge of arms policy and arms 
cooperation, notes Germany's isolation in important arms and 
security policy questions. Due to the restrictive stance 
concerning arms exports prescribed by the Foreign Office, 
Germany is "degrading" herself "as a second class alliance 
partner and European." 
  Rauch writes further that "the cultivation of an ethical 
mentality of rigorism on arms exports" makes Germany "incapable 
of an arms and cooperation policy in the EU [European Union], 
WEU [Western European Union], and NATO" and represents "the 
opposite of a policy of responsibility by a sovereign state." 
Evidently, the Kinkel ministry neglects to check whether Bonn's 
European and alliance capability suffers thereby. "In Bonn the 
watch on the No stands firm and true! [A pun on a German song, 
`The Watch on the Rhine'] Expedient internal and party policy 
considerations are projected externally and passed off as 
foreign policy or foreign trade policy, " the report states. 
  While other nations, such as Great Britain and France, are 
strengthening their arms technology capabilities, the German 
arms industry will further lose substance due to the restriction 
of competitive opportunities on the world market and the deep 
cuts in the defense budget. According to internal computations, 
one must postulate "that by the end of next year in France and 
Great Britain more workers will be employed in arms export jobs 
than will still exist in the entire German arms industry." 
  In Germany's arms industry, only about 30 percent of 1989 
production plants and 10 percent of 1989 production capacities 
will still exist by 1995. If this development continues, says 
the report in a different passage, "the German arms industry 
will become an extended workbench for a formally privatized, yet 
state-directed French arms industry, and a largely 
transatlantic-oriented British one." 
  Especially in the ministries for external affairs and trade, 
headed by the FDP [Free Democratic Party], a realistic attitude 
promoting German economic interests encounters opposition. Last 
fall, after talks by arms firms with the foreign and economics 
ministers, a task force on "general basic export conditions" was 
established in which Rauch, as an expert on arms export policy, 
was also a member with the approval of the defense ministry. On 
26 November of last year, when the task force wanted to hand a 
memorandum to the head of the economics department of the 
Foreign Office, Rauch as the official representative of the 
German arms director at NATO was denied participation in the 
meeting. 
  At the same time, the Foreign Office is unable to refute 
with 
facts the myths of an allegedly unscrupulous German export 
policy. It is disquieting "with how much insincerity and 
hypocrisy our allies carry out state-sanctioned illegal arms 
exports, while as a diversion, Germany is presented as the 
whipping boy, only because a few of our criminal types, who 
incidentally have nothing to do with the arms industry, cannot 
restrain their morbidly exaggerated pursuit of profit," writes 
Rauch. 
  In conclusion, the German official writes that the German 
political class nurtures a "comfortable narrowing of the field 
of vision which a people in the geopolitical center of the 
continent cannot afford, and hence should not accept being 
dictated to by friends in a peripheral location. From the 
worm's-eye view of the Bonn basin, whoever directs his gaze 
one-eyed and laboriously beyond the Rhenisch slate mountains 
toward Paris, is far from having a European vision. He does not 
even have the beginnings of an idea of the dimensions of an arms 
and defense cooperation policy, which could do its bit to secure 
freedom, peace and prosperity for the 80 million people in the 
heart of Europe in the coming century, too."

<F P=106> [Article by Ruediger Moniac: "Confusion About Arms Exports: </F>
Ebenhausen Foundation Contradicts SIPRI Statistics"] 
  [Text] The news from the Stockholm International Peace 
Research Institute [SIPRI] received widespread attention in 
Germany. Even in the German Bundestag it was accepted as true 
and authentic by most parliamentarians: In 1992, the FRG moved 
into third place behind the United States and Russia in 
worldwide arms exports. 
  Overall, united Germany has exported weapons and weapons 
systems for about $1.9 billion to all parts of the world. The 
former USSR was slightly ahead with an export volume of $2 
billion. According to the SIPRI researchers, the United States 
was the unchallenged leader with $8.4 billion. 
  What really lies behind these SIPRI statistics was now 
studied by the Foundation of Science and Policy (SWP) in 
Ebenhausen with surprising results: First, the German arms 
industry "is involved" in global arms exports "only to an 
infinitesimally small degree" and, second, Germany's top ranking 
computed by SIPRI results "from applying a questionable method 
of calculating revenues." 
  Therefore, the SWP analysis sees the SIPRI work as a 
"distorted picture of German arms export policy." The public 
discussion ultimately does not even take note that the 
modification of the arms export policy desired by the Federal 
Government "in its core aims at reestablishing Germany's 
alliance and cooperation capability and not, as imputed, at 
unrestrained expansion of arms exports." According to SWP, Bonn 
so far has neglected to clarify "these correlations." 
  The SWP study is based on data of a register kept by the 
United Nations since 1992 on exports of conventional weapons. 
They showed that "the German arms exports" reported by SIPRI 
"consist almost exclusively of used NVA [National People's Army] 
and Bundeswehr equipment passed on" to NATO allies and 
Scandinavian countries. 
  As a result of disarmament agreements, the Bundeswehr had to 
muster out considerable weapons inventories and passed this 
materiel on to NATO allies with less modern equipment. The 
result: The Bundeswehr saves the costs of scrapping; the 
receiver country, for little money, gets more modern armed 
forces; and NATO ultimately has better equipped armed forces 
overall. 
  SWP uses a second example to illustrate the criticized 
"distorted picture" painted by SIPRI: Among other things, this 
deals with exports of "demilitarized" NVA ships, especially to 
Indonesia (six) and Tunisia (four). SIPRI had calculated 
this--like other--materiel on the basis of a "hypothetical 
revenue volume of 40 percent of its potential new value" and had 
thus arrived at an "exorbitant total sum of $1.9 billion." SWP 
judges this method: "If SIPRI had looked at the actual revenue 
obtained, the FRG would have landed on one of the lower places."

  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Relations between Spain and Argentina 
are entering a new phase. They have passed from cooperation and 
solidarity between a richer country -- Spain -- and another in a 
poorer economic condition -- Argentina -- to a trade 
relationship based on exchange between equals. This was made 
clear during the course of the visit that Argentine President 
Carlos Menem is paying to our country, at a time when our 
excellent bilateral relations are clouded by just one problem: 
Iberia's negotiations with Aerolineas Argentinas -- a report 
from Martin Meden. 
  [Begin Meden recording] Felipe Gonzalez recalled that in 
1989 
he backed the future of Argentina by recommending investment 
there, and today he congratulated President Menem on what he 
considers the success of his country. Argentina and Spain, 
Menem and Gonzalez agreed, are now on the same political and 
economic level, thereby favoring the European Union's 
understanding of the process of Latin America's integration with 
the United States. Gonzalez said that Spain supports the 
diplomatic and peaceful claim of Argentine sovereignty over the 
Malvinas [Falkland] Islands. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [M. Abizanda report: "Air Force Must Reduce Its Operating </F>
Expenses in Order To Maintain Torrejon and Zaragoza"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The Air Force budget shows appreciable 
cuts in the expenditure items relating to operational and 
systems modernization matters, while on the other hand those 
relating to logistical support are increasing. The latter show 
a 503.29-percent increase in order to meet the financing of the 
expenditure resulting from maintaining the Torrejon and Zaragoza 
bases following the Americans' withdrawal. 
  Although the Air Force budget increases by 5.675 billion 
pesetas -- 4.07 percent -- over the 1993 budget, the items 
devoted to fuel and equipment modernization show considerable 
decreases in some programs. 
  Thus the item devoted to the Armed Forces' [as published] 
operating costs shows a 23.3-percent increase over the previous 
year, although this increase is caused by a rise in expenditure 
on food and clothing. On the other hand the subprogram devoted 
to "fuel and lubricants" shows a 5.3-percent fall, from 3.168 
billion pesetas in 1993 to the 3 billion pesetas in 1994. This 
emerges from a report published by the REVISTA DE AERONAUTICA Y 
ASTRONAUTICA, published by the Air Force itself. 
  However, the Air Force's fuel costs total 6 billion pesetas, 
the difference being offset by the financial contributions from 
the ministries for which the Air Force performs various 
services, such as transporting VIP's or the fire-fighting 
missions which it carries out for the National Institute for 
Nature Conservation. 
  The biggest cuts occur in the modernization program, 
although 
in overall terms it also rises slightly, by 6.67 percent. 
Specifically, the missiles subprogram is cut by 29.65 percent 
(from 3.016 billion to 2.122 billion pesetas); the fighter 
aircraft subprogram is cut by 15.95 percent (from 3.567 billion 
to 2.999 billion pesetas); the cargo and in-flight refueling 
aircraft subprogram is cut by 6.17 percent; and the ammunition 
and explosives subprogram is cut by 26.82 percent. The training 
aircraft subprogram is eliminated. 
  However, in this modernization program there are increases 
in 
the sums earmarked for electronic warfare (152.53 percent), 
warning, command, and control systems (90.10 percent), and 
especially,"other materials and equipment and logistical 
support," which rise by 503.29 percent. 
  This considerable increase comes as a result of the need to 
finance the expenditure resulting from maintaining the 
infrastructure of the Torrejon and Zaragoza bases following the 
withdrawal of the U.S. units stationed there, representing 3.431 
billion pesetas. This financing was not previously an Air Force 
responsibility. 
  Other expenses which disappear are those relating to 
hospitals, homes, and cultural centers. 
  For its part the Defense Ministry believes that the Air 
Force 
units' ability to react has not been affected -- "at least, not 
substantially" -- since it states that the budget cuts have so 
far been applied to those units which can have the least impact 
on combat operations or operations directly supporting them.

  [Text] Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas 
believes that the allied attack on aircraft of the former 
Yugoslavia does not place the Spanish blue helmets in particular 
danger, because more tense situations have been experienced, 
such as the one last week when the Western ultimatum expired. 
  In statements in the Congress lobby prior to reporting to a 
closed session on the operational situation of the Armed Forces, 
the minister explained that it is still not known to which force 
the downed aircraft belonged because noone is owning up to it. 
For this reason, an increase in tension is not expected. 
  Garcia Vargas considers that, in a sense, the attack was 
expected because it has always been thought, he said, that the 
violation of the air exclusion zone should elicit a response. 
Yesterday saw the materialization of a possibility that had 
always existed. 
  He also referred to the possibility of mortar attacks on 
Sarajevo. If this shelling is continuous, he said, there will 
be a NATO attack.

<F P=106> [Josep M. Orta report: "People's Party Wishes To Standardize </F>
Powers in All Autonomous Communities"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- The People's Party is proposing a 
standardization of the powers of all the autonomous communities 
which will respect singularities in the cultural or linguistic 
fields through a program to be implemented within the maximum 
period of two legislative terms, with the aim of completing the 
state of the autonomous communities, according to what People's 
Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar explained yesterday when 
presenting in Barcelona a document entitled "Basic Principles 
for a National Agreement To Complete the Implementation of 
Autonomy." 
  In this document, the People's Party proposes to the 
government and all the political and social forces that they 
make their contributions in order to "give final shape" to Title 
VIII of the Constitution and prevent "going so far as to change 
the state's structure under the euphemism of new interpretations 
of the statutes." 
  Aznar emphatically denied that the document could be a 
reformulation of the LOAPA [Organic Law on the Harmonization of 
the Autonomy Process]. He explained that a major agreement is 
necessary "in order to give final shape to the state of the 
autonomous communities," and emphasized that this can only be 
done with everybody's contributions, in order to shape a stable 
system, irrespective of who holds power. "I am trying to make 
the most rigorous effort possible. If there is anything that 
this document does not resemble at all, it is the LOAPA. The 
comparison is risible." Next, he stated that the document 
speaks of single administration, state transfers, and fiscal 
joint responsibility. "Which of these things is in the LOAPA, 
which was a law of downward harmonization?" 
  With constant references to the framework of the 
Constitution, Aznar warned that, in his opinion, "no government 
holds sufficient legitimacy to transfer powers without taking 
the constitutional pact into account," and added -- with respect 
to possible agreements between the Spanish Socialist Workers 
Party and Convergence and Union -- that "mere application of the 
parliamentary majority to transfer state powers to the 
autonomous communities respects the formal requirements of 
democracy but makes any decision of this kind reversible, and 
could call the constitutional pact into question." 
  On these premises, Aznar explained that outside the 
"framework laid down by the national agreement there can be no 
bilateral relations which, directly or indirectly, could go so 
far as to change the configuration of the state of the 
autonomous communities by transferring state powers," and the 
document even says that yielding to the constant autonomy 
demands could cause a "process of comparative grievances," which 
would lead to the "weakening of the state's power," entailing a 
"a crisis difficult to resolve in the constitutional model of 
the state of the autonomous communities." The document contains 
nine points: 
  1. To define the powers of the state which are 
nontransferable and cannot be delegated because they pertain to 
the principle of national sovereignty. 
  2. To determine the powers which, since they can be 
autonomous or state powers, are capable of transfer or 
delegation. 
  3. Applying the single administration principle, to reduce 
the state's peripheral administration and organize inspection 
services in the matters which are thus laid down in the 
Constitution. 
  4. To define the functions and services which, while still 
coming under the state, correspond to transferred powers. 
  5. To lay down a program with a maximum period of two 
legislative terms to carry out a process of basic 
standardization of powers among all the communities, excepting 
the singularities resulting from distinctive features. 
  6. To shape a funding model based on the principle of fiscal 
joint responsibility. 
  7. To establish a program of transfers to local authorities. 
  8. To set up a permanent body for the autonomous 
communities' 
participation in defining the government's stance in the 
European Union on matters for which they are responsible. 
  9. Constitutional reform to establish the Senate as a house 
of territorial representation.

<F P=106> [Article by Lisbet Lambert and Lars Halskov Ritzau: "The </F>
Move to Riga"] 
  [Text] Two years ago, three Danish firms acquired 56 
percent of the shares in the Latvian firm of Saiva, Inc., in 
Sloka south of Riga. And at machines from the Danish clothing 
manufacturing firm of Nybo Jensen, Inc., in Viborg, 80 Latvian 
seamstresses now work for a monthly wage that no Danish 
seamstress can compete with. 
  There are Danish machines, chairs, and lamps set up in the 
room. And it is work clothing for Danish workers at Danish 
companies that is being manufactured in the sewing room. 
  But it is the pale Latvian winter sun shining in through the 
big window panes. And 26-year-old Laila Serritslev, who monitors 
the quality of the ready-made clothing, does not get far if she 
tries to speak Danish to the seamstresses seated at the machines. 
  The conversation, though, proceeds briskly in the sewing 
room. But it is Latvian and Russian chatter flying across the 
room. 
  The seamstresses' flower-patterned smocks stand in sharp 
contrast to the bundles of white fabric that, stitch by stitch 
and machine by machine, end up as finished smocks for Danish 
hospitals. 
  The machines come from the Danish clothing manufacturing 
firm 
of Nybo Jensen, Inc., in Viborg. It took just one weekend to 
move them to the Latvian town of Sloka, 25 km south of Riga. 
  Friday, 2 July 1993 was the last day of work for 44 Danish 
seamstresses at the plant in Viborg. The entire sewing operation 
was shut down. The Monday [5 July] after that, 80 Latvian 
seamstresses were sewing work clothing on the same machines for 
the firm of Saiva, Inc., in Sloka. 
  Currently, Nybo Jensen produces only 300 pieces of clothing 
per day in Denmark, and that is done by a subcontractor. There 
are still about 35 employees working for the company in Viborg, 
but they are only involved in administration and the design, 
cutting, and packing of clothing. 
  Danish seamstresses earning a monthly salary of between 
12,000 and 15,000 kroner cannot compete with the Latvian 
seamstresses at Saiva, who earn between 240 and 1,200 kroner -- 
all dependent on how quickly they can get the clothing through 
the sewing machines. 
  Even if the wages are low, the Latvian seamstresses are 
happy 
just to have work. In just two years, the number of jobs in the 
Latvian textile and clothing manufacturing industry has been 
more than cut in half. In 1991 about 56,000 people worked in the 
industry. Today that number is down to 26,000. 
  And even those seamstresses who still have jobs at one of 
the 
state enterprises do not automatically receive their wages. Many 
of them must now see to it themselves that they get their salary 
because the plants can no longer sell their goods to the former 
Soviet Union. 
  Formerly about 90 percent of Latvia's production of textiles 
and clothing went to the old empire. But that is now over. 
Business partners in the new SNG [Commonwealth of Independent 
States] countries no longer buy goods from Latvian businesses. 
<H5>  With Hat in Hand </H5>
  So many seamstresses stand in the marketplace behind the 
train station in Riga each holding the clothes she has made. 
Even if the winter weather is cold, they stand for many hours 
and display a sweater or a pair of stockings. To get a monthly 
wage, the seamstresses must go to the marketplace themselves to 
sell the clothing they have produced at the state factories. 
  That is why seamstresses stand hat in hand in front of 
textile and clothing manufacturing firms that have foreign 
capital. Because with them they are certain of getting a wage, 
even if that wage is not particularly high. 
  Many seamstresses have also been let go at Saiva in Sloka, 
where the Danish Nybo Jensen clothing factory moved its 
manufacturing. During the Soviet period, there were 3,000 
employees at the firm, but today there are only 300 employees 
working under the new ownership. Factory owner Peder Nybo Jensen 
does not own shares in the plant. 
  The three Danish firms of Spectre, Godske, and Power 
acquired 
56 percent of the shares when the state enterprise was 
privatized almost two years ago. Latvian partners have the 
remainder of the shares. Today the plant is entirely dependent 
on orders from the west. But the firm's Latvian director is 
still the same, however. 
  "I usually call myself the salaries director," said the 
director, Pavel K. Kukel. 
  "The Danish partners are responsible for the orders, the 
technology, the raw goods, sales, and marketing. From our side, 
all we contribute is cheap wages and the organization of the 
labor. Those are the principles. They are based on one fact: We 
have much lower wages than in the west," he said. 
  The only Dane who moved with Nybo Jensen's machines in the 
summer of 1993 was Laila Serritslev. She had been employed as a 
manufacturing assistant in Viborg but was offered the position 
in Latvia. 
  Here she sees to it that the quality of the Danish clothes 
is 
maintained. She is supposed to instruct the Latvian seamstresses 
in the use of the modern machines and is responsible for 
maintaining the contact with Nybo Jensen in Denmark. 
  Her base is a small office with a telephone and a fax 
machine. And squeezed in between the frequent visits to the 
production room, she tries to tie everything together in the 
office. 
<H5>  Slower Pace </H5>
  She discusses the latest patterns with designers and 
builders 
in Denmark and instructs the Latvian seamstresses. They often 
look in with questions for the Danish instructors who follow 
along with the cut out clothing from Denmark. 
  The instruction proceeds with the help of sign language and 
individual words in German or English. If things get more 
complicated, the plant's interpreter interprets into Latvian or 
Russian. 
  Laila Serritslev has not had problems instructing her 
experienced Latvian seamstresses. It has taken more time to deal 
with those without experience, but things are not more different 
here than in Denmark, she says. 
  "The Latvian seamstresses are very quality conscious. The 
clothing here at the plant is of exactly the same quality as the 
clothing manufactured back home," she stated. 
  The only difference is the pace. The Latvian seamstresses 
are 
just not used to the pace that is customary in Danish clothing 
manufacturing plants. 
  Laila Serritslev is responsible for seeing to it that orders 
are ready on time. And when the seamstresses are not that quick 
-- then they have to work for longer periods. The finished 
clothing leaves for Denmark by truck each Thursday. That means 
that some of the seamstresses have very long work days. From 
0600 until 1800 hours is not uncommon. But in the future it will 
no longer be Laila Serritslev's job to see to it that the 
clothes are ready on time. After working in Sloka for six 
months, she has found a new job. Back home in Denmark. 
  But the Danish manufacturing will continue at Saiva. 
<H5>  Cheap Labor </H5>
  There are very big differences in the hourly wage in the 
textile industries in East and West Europe. Indicated on the map 
[not reproduced here] are the average hourly wages for a textile 
worker including bonuses but excluding social benefits. Social 
benefit costs vary greatly from country to country but if they 
are included, the costs are practically the same in West Europe. 
The figures here are given in Danish kroner.

<F P=106> [Inaugural speech by President Martti Ahtisaari in Helsinki </F>
-- live; passages in quotation marks in Swedish] 
  [Text] Madame Speaker, representatives of the Finnish 
people! 
  Having been elected president of the Republic in a direct 
popular vote, and having made the solemn declaration before the 
Eduskunta as required by the Constitution, I shall begin to 
discharge the duties of president of the Republic during the 
term ahead. I feel great humility before the responsibility 
that the discharging of the duties of president involves. To 
the best of my ability, I shall discharge the duties incumbent 
on the president under the Constitution in good cooperation with 
the Eduskunta and the government that enjoys its confidence. 
  I thank you, Madame Speaker, for your good wishes. I would 
like to express my agreement with your thoughts about the tasks 
facing us. I hope in particular that the citizens, in as large 
numbers as possible, would and could take part in the work for 
our joint fatherland. 
  Receiving now the duties of the president of the Republic, I 
want, from the bottom of my heart and in the name of the nation, 
to express cordial thanks to President Mauno Koivisto, my 
honored predecessor, for the great contribution he has made for 
the benefit of our country and international security. 
President Koivisto, under your leadership, Finland has been 
able to strengthen and improve its international position at a 
time when the long-standing division of Europe has finally 
ended. You demonstrated courage and determination faced with 
big and far-reaching choices. Although the uncertainty still 
continues in the international community, Finland's position in 
it has developed in a favorable way. For this I am deeply 
grateful to you because it offers an excellent starting point 
for my own work. 
  You have given your support to parliamentarism, to the 
strengthening of its rules. Your contribution in this respect 
is historic. You are leaving a state ship that now has a strong 
democratic keel. 
  In the name of the nation, I want to express respectful 
thanks to you too, Mrs. Tellervo Koivisto. You have carried out 
your work in an exemplary way, and for this you deserve the 
undivided appreciation of all Finns. 
  Honored Eduskunta deputies! Good management of the matters 
of the realm always calls for the seamless cooperation between 
the president, the Eduskunta and the Council of State. For my 
own part, this is what I aim for. The president of the Republic 
must be a uniting political force. We Finns understand that a 
small nation is strong only when united. In a pluralistic 
society, understanding can, however, only be reached through 
open debate and by respecting the principles of a society of 
consensus. 
  The direct popular vote has, for its part, changed our 
political life and strengthened democracy. I want to develop 
the president's position and duties in such a way that the 
significance of the direct popular vote serves as well as 
possible what is best in the entire society. 
  "I take up my duties as president of the Republic in a 
situation that is still characterized by economic uncertainty, 
above all large unemployment. It will still take a long time 
before the economic growth leads to improved employment in a 
decisive way. The year that has started is the fourth in 
succession with an unemployment at an intolerably high level. 
During my election campaign, I was forced to witness a sense of 
hopelessness that, as a result of the difficult employment 
situation and the reduced standard of living, has affected large 
sectors of the population. Unemployment hits hard the sectors 
dominated by women. Unemployment threatens family unity, it 
hits hard the smallest ones, our children. 
  ``Therefore, in order to beat unemployment, readiness and 
courage are needed to take special measures. The economic 
policy, which has been pursued in our country, has in the last 
two years been mainly geared to attempting to save the people 
from the problems that have piled up. We must, however, beware 
of believing that only one alternative, only one way forward, is 
on offer. 
  ``We need extensive political cooperation to put an end to 
the depression and create new jobs. Human dignity must be 
brought out as a resource within the new policy of mutual 
understanding. It is important to ensure that our much-punished 
fellow citizens do not lose their belief in tomorrow. When many 
members of Finnish society are in great difficulty through no 
fault of their own, it is not the right time to abolish the 
support systems that have been developed for these situations. 
  ``I am convinced that the Finns want to develop their 
society 
in a balanced way, as a society of citizens where the Nordic 
ideals of equality and justice are fulfilled. But the state 
must not be an admonishing big brother, but a friend offering 
security and new opportunities.'' 
  Honored Eduskunta deputies! Under the Constitution, the 
most central task of the president of the Republic is to decide 
on the realm's relations with external powers. I shall act in 
such a way that I will be in charge of the country's foreign and 
security policy in cooperation with the Council of State and the 
Eduskunta. 
  Our foreign and security political surroundings have changed 
enormously in the last few years, and all changes are by no 
means over yet. This poses new challenges to us too, many of 
which are such that we will meet them best by intensifying 
cooperation with other countries. Our own economic prosperity 
is more decisively than before linked to the world economy and 
its very sudden fluctuations. Therefore, both our material and 
spiritual welfare is largely dependent on a favorable 
development of the world economy. 
  Nurturing good-neighborly relations is a sensible political 
aim for each country. The relations with the Nordic countries, 
Russia, and the Baltic countries form a working basis for our 
external relations. We Finns, who have paid for our 
independence in heavy wars, understand the importance of 
continuously strengthening the foundation of security. It is 
more a matter, not of raising a fence, but of opening a gate. 
  "After the division of Europe ended, it has not yet been 
possible to create a new security system to replace the former 
one. From the Finnish viewpoint, it is extremely important that 
a new division of the continent is prevented. A European 
security system, based on cooperation and mutual dependence, 
offers us the most encouraging prospects. The creation of such 
a Europe of solidarity constitutes perhaps the most significant 
challenge to our country's foreign policy in the 1990's. 
  ``The expansion of the European Union is proof that the 
affinity between the states assumes ever firmer forms. We are 
part of this process. This promotes both our national welfare 
and our security.'' 
  Membership in the European Union is an opportunity for us. 
With the help of the European Union, we Finns want to prevent 
the raising of fences and promote the opening of gates. We 
grasp this opportunity, relying on our Nordic values. It is to 
be hoped that eventually all Nordic countries who sought 
membership -- Finland, Sweden, and Norway -- should become 
members of the Union. 
  A thorough survey of the advantages and drawbacks of 
membership must be made in Finland before a referendum. The 
negotiation result is a significant factor for the forming of an 
opinion. As many Finns as possible should form a measured 
opinion of membership. As president of the Republic, I will do 
my utmost so that membership in the European Union shall not 
become a factor dividing our nation. 
  Madame Speaker, honored Eduskunta deputies! I want to base 
my activity on the principles of joint responsibility, fairness, 
openness, and cooperation. We Finns have a good reputation in 
the world. We are trusted and our tenacity is recognized. We 
do not give in, not now either. We look forward with 
confidence. Behind the mountains still facing us, a better 
tomorrow is already looming. Let it be the day when the Finns 
are again convinced that this dear fatherland of ours is the 
best country for us to live in and build our future. 
  As I now begin to discharge the duties of the president of 
the Republic, I wish for support from you and the entire Finnish 
people for my work. I shall seek to carry it out with all my 
strength and to the best of my ability, with the only aim being 
the happiness and success of the Finnish people. May God bless 
our fatherland and our people!

<F P=106> [Article by Mats Knutson: "Moderate Party Gets Good Grade on </F>
Bridge Issue"] 
  [Text] The Moderates moved up in public opinion following 
agreement within the government regarding the Oresund Bridge. 
Support for the Center Party was affected marginally, while the 
Social Democratic Party [SDP] lost a small amount. This is shown 
by the latest SVENSKA DAGBLADET/SIFO [Swedish Institute for 
Public Opinion Polls] voter barometer. 
  According to the January poll, New Democracy is continuing 
to 
lose ground. The party now has only 4 percent of the potential 
vote and is therefore in danger of losing its seats in the 
Riksdag. 
  "This poll was concerned primarily with the Oresund Bridge. 
The Moderates were rewarded because Prime Minister Carl Bildt 
was able to hold the government together," says Alf Sjostrom, 
who is in charge of SIFO's poll. 
<H5>  Up 3 Percent </H5>
  After the coalition parties reached agreement on the bridge 
at the cabinet meeting on 13 January, public opinion's support 
for the Moderates rose 3 percentage points (from 19 to 22 
percent) in less than a week. 
  The voter barometer as a whole represents the weighted 
result 
of three separate polls. The full impact of the rise in public 
support for the Moderates immediately after the agreement on the 
bridge therefore does not show up in the combined voter 
barometer. 
  The SVENSKA DAGBLADET/SIFO voter barometer as a whole is 
based on 2,839 interviews conducted between 10 and 27 January. 
The interviewees, who were selected at random, answered the 
question: "Which party would you vote for if elections were 
being held today?" 
  The voter barometer for January looks like this (with 
December figures shown in parentheses): Social Democrats: 49.8 
percent (48.9); Left Party: 3.9 (3.9); Moderates: 20.6 (20.3); 
Center Party: 6.9 (6.4); Liberal Party: 6.3 (7.5); Christian 
Democrats: 4.9 (4.6); Green Party: 2.9 (3.2); New Democracy: 4.0 
(5.0); and others: 0.7 (0.2). 
  The number of voters who would cast blank ballots or could 
not name a party came to 14.2 percent (13.2 percent in December).

<H5>  Bridge Most Important Issue </H5>
  The most important political event during the poll period 
was 
the government's talks regarding the Oresund Bridge. 
  The result of the agreement that was reached on 13 January 
following two weeks of tough and sometimes dramatic negotiations 
is that the Center Party is remaining in the coalition and the 
Oresund Bridge will probably be built. 
  "Taking a cynical view of the result, the Center Party's 
behavior meant that the party obtained a slight delay in 
construction of the bridge and remained in the coalition. But 
the Center Party was unable to halt the bridge," says Sjostrom. 
  The three separate polls forming the basis of the January 
voter barometer consisted of about 1,000 interviews each. Those 
three polls reflect the shifts in public opinion throughout the 
period. 
  The first poll was conducted between 10 and 13 January -- 
that is, before the government reached agreement on the bridge 
issue. 
  During that period, the Moderates received 19 percent, the 
Center Party 6.5 percent, and the Social Democrats 51 percent of 
the potential vote. 
<H5>  Change Makes Itself Felt </H5>
  The second poll took place between 17 and 20 January. That 
was when the change in public opinion made itself felt: after 
the bridge decision. The Moderates now had 22 percent of the 
potential vote, compared to 7 percent for the Center Party and 
49 percent for the Social Democrats. 
  The third poll, conducted between 24 and 27 January, shows 
that public opinion has stabilized somewhat. The Moderates have 
21 percent, the Center Party 7 percent, and the Social Democrats 
49 percent. 
  "Once the government made its decision, support rose for the 
Moderates and fell for the Social Democrats," says Sjostrom. 
  Support for the Center Party was affected only marginally. 
  This should be interpreted as meaning that the voters do not 
want a government crisis, he says. 
  "At least not over that issue. Instead, what they are 
rewarding is stability in political work, and the increased 
support for the Moderates is probably due to Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt's way of handling the bridge issue within the coalition." 
  The combined voter barometer for January shows that the 
Social Democrats are keeping their hold on the voters. New 
Democracy is continuing its decline and now stands at the 
4-percent threshold required for representation in the Riksdag. 
  "That is a trend which has been accentuated since last fall, 
when New Democracy reached agreement with the government on 
economic policy," says Sjostrom. 
  "New Democracy is losing voters primarily to the Moderates 
and the Social Democrats. Those are the parties from which it 
got most of its voters to start with." 
<H5>  Social Democratic Budget in Next Poll </H5>
  The Social Democratic Party's shadow budget was presented 
this week and therefore had no effect on this voter barometer, 
according to Sjostrom. 
  "Voter reaction to presentation of the Social Democratic 
Party's alternative to the economic policy will show up in the 
next voter barometer," he said.

  [Editorial Report] A poll of supporters of the Swedish 
political parties indicates that if New Democracy were to break 
up before the election, most of its supporters would switch to 
the Moderates or the Social Democrats. Supporters of various 
parties were surveyed in October 1993 by IMU on their attitudes 
toward the other parties; Lars Ryding reported the results in 
the 7 February SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 11. Respondents were 
asked whether they would consider voting for a party, the 
alternatives being: would definitely vote for the party, would 
consider it, probably would not, or absolutely would not. Of the 
21 percent who said they would consider voting for New 
Democracy, 57 percent also had positive attitudes toward the 
Moderates and 53 percent toward the Social Democrats. The other 
parties made out less well, although the nonsocialist parties 
would get the majority of voters. A total of 40 percent would 
consider voting for the Center Party, 31 percent for the Green 
Party, 29 percent for the Liberals, 20 percent for the Christian 
Democrats, and 17 percent for the Left Party.

<F P=106> [The "Views" column: "Playing With Fire"] </F>
  [Text] A U.S. air raid takes place under NATO auspices and 
four aircraft are downed just when peace efforts are developing 
to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia and find a political solution to 
defuse the crisis. 
  Just when the Serbs, given an ultimatum, are complying and 
are withdrawing their heavy weapons from the besieged Sarajevo, 
they find themselves accused of "having violated the no-fly 
zone." However, such violations take place continuously. 
Therefore, yesterday's flights could be used only as a pretext 
for the strike. 
  At the time when everybody is in agony and fears an 
expansion 
of the war in the Balkans with more general implications, they 
are dangerously playing with fire, which could undermine and 
upset the entire peace effort. 
  It is obvious that the Americans want to promote their own 
solution within the framework of the "new order." The solution 
of missiles and the superpower's strength. 
  So, it is reasonable that there is concern in all the 
capitals of the countries that are participating in the peace 
efforts, including Athens, which has additional reasons to be 
concerned since it is within the explosive zone. 
  The solution to the drama of Bosnia will not be given by 
missiles and air raids but by the peace efforts, without any 
undermining actions under the table. 
  Hope to God that there will be no continuation and 
escalation 
of tension after this incident. Hope to God that things are not 
led again into a deadlock and war entanglement. 
  The "new order" has shown its face once again. It has shown 
that it does not hesitate to stir up tension without considering 
the consequences. 
  It has shown that its basic argument at every peace dialogue 
is the persuasion of arms.

  [Text] Ankara, March 2 (A.A) -- Russian Ambassador to 
Ankara Albert Chernyshev said on Tuesday [2 March] that a common 
market could be established in the region. 
  Chernyshev, who was in Ankara for six and a half years as 
ambassador, hosted a farewell reception before his departure to 
his country, where he was appointed as deputy foreign minister. 
  After a one-hour meeting with President Suleyman Demirel, 
Chernyshev told journalists that he and Demirel exchanged views 
on almost every subject. 
  "Strong friendly relations are necessary in the region to 
overcome problems," he said. 
  Chernyshev, who expressed his emotions of leaving Turkey, as 
"my heart will stay here," will be responsible of an area 
covering the Black Sea, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Turkey, 
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and the Maldives. 
  He said that no other country was welcoming either Turkey 
and 
Russia to sell their goods and "here is our great market, we 
have this opportunity and we should work in this direction." 
  "We are obliged to cooperate. Peace and stability should 
exist here," he concluded.

  [Text] Ankara--The acrimonious debate surrounding Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller's allegation that funds raised for Bosnia 
by the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) have been diverted for 
other purposes looks set to grow in the coming days. 
  If Ciller can provide proof to back her allegations then 
this 
may prove to be the reef that the RP actually flounders on, 
colliding head on with the concept of "Islamic purity." If, 
however Ciller cannot prove her allegations then this could be 
the last straw in terms of her overall credibility, with 
disastrous effects on her True Path Party (DYP) politically. 
  While Ciller and the government remained silent on the 
subject on Thursday [24 February], Sevket Kazan, a leading 
member of the RP, tried to disprove the allegations by producing 
bank dockets he claimed showed the money had gone to its 
rightful destination. Bosnia-Herzegovina's Ambassador to Ankara 
Hayrudin Somum, for his part, confirmed to the Turkish Daily 
News that he had personally witnessed the transfer of DM 50,000 
(approx. TL 540 million) and $60,000 (approx TL 1.08 billion) 
from the RP to Bosnia President Alija Izetbegovic, for which he 
said a receipt has been issued. 
  Somum said the transfer took place at Istanbul airport on 
June 20 last year, as Izetbegovi was leaving Turkey after one of 
his many visits. 
  Ambassador Somum indicated however that he was not aware of 
any other transfers and "could not say anything for sure on this 
subject." 
  There have been some suggestions that the recent petty 
corruption charges the RP has faced, and especially those 
concerning its mayoral candidate for Istanbul Tayyip Erdogan, 
may in fact have rebounded as sympathy for the party. Some 
analysts have argued that the great manner in which the media 
has focused on relatively small corruption charges against the 
RP when the other parties are currently accused of much greater 
graft may actually translate into sympathy for the Welfare camp. 
  But Ciller's claim this time carries the potential of doing 
the party a lot of damage if it can be substantiated. Ciller 
reportedly claimed to deputies of her True Path Party (DYP) 
during a party group meeting on Tuesday in Parliament that the 
RP had not sent the money it collected for Bosnia and that she 
had proof to this effect which she would disclose later. This 
claim was leaked to the press by deputies attending the meeting 
which was closed to journalists. 
  State Minister Necmettin Cevheri confirmed reports of the 
claim when he announced on Wednesday that there were indications 
that of the TL 26 billion collected by the RP, TL20 billion was 
unaccounted for. He added that the prime minister's office had 
started an investigation concerning allegations that this TL 20 
billion had been diverted. 
  Cevheri suggested that such an investigation would also be 
good for the RP because it would prove, as the party's leading 
officials were claiming, that nothing irregular had taken place. 
Bosnian Ambassador to Ankara Hayrudin Somum was quoted in the 
Turkish press on Thursday as saying that they had been exhorting 
organizations gathering funds for Bosnia to cooperate with the 
Turkish Red Crescent Society, the Directorate for Religious 
Affairs and their embassy in Ankara in order for aid to reach 
its goal effectively. 
  Somum appeared to be saying in this way that if all of the 
money in question had been sent as the RP was saying, this had 
not gone to Bosnia through his embassy. 
  The general director of the Turkish Red Crescent Society, 
Unal Somuncu, was also quoted in the press on Thursday as saying 
that "not a penny had come to them" from the Welfare Party for 
Bosnia. 
  The deep concern in the Welfare camp in the face of these 
developments was more than apparent in the statements of the 
party's leading figures on Wednesday and Thursday. 
  Analysts say that if the government can prove a serious case 
of corruption involving the RP and that funds gathered for 
Bosnia had indeed been diverted--presumably for campaign 
purposes--then this could do the party immeasurable damage in 
terms of its image as a "clean Islamic party." 
  What makes this charge worse than the charge of having 
houses 
built illegally on land belonging to the ministry (which RP 
Istanbul mayoral candidate Tayyip Erdogan is facing) is that 
this charge is a direct affront to one of the deepest and 
holiest tenets of Islam: namely "thou shalt not steal the 
orphans' share." To do so, according to Islam, is something 
that even Allah cannot forgive. 
  Addressing deputies from his party, Kazan, the deputy 
chairman of the RP's parliamentary group, on Wednesday accused 
the government as well as other sections of society in Turkey of 
trying to do all in their power to prevent his party from coming 
to power. 
  "They would even get rid of democracy if they felt it 
necessary to prevent the RP from coming to power," Kazan had 
retorted angrily. 
  Going on the offensive against the charges leveled at this 
party, Kazan said it was during President Demirel's term as 
prime minister that money had actually been diverted. He said 
that of the TL 12 billion that had been collected, TL 3.9 
billion had been used to buy clothes and TL 215 million had been 
used to buy wheat and sugar to send to Bosnia. Kazan alleged 
that the remaining money had been seized by the government while 
it was in a special account in Vakifbank. 
  This allegation was strongly denied on Thursday by President 
Demirel's office which said in a written statement that the TL 
12 billion mentioned here had been presented by the director of 
religious affairs to Demirel who had immediately handed it over 
to the representative of the Turkish Red Crescent Society in 
front of press cameras. 
  Talking to the press later on Wednesday, Kazan had 
distinguished between his party and members and sympathizers of 
the party who he said had collected funds for Bosnia. 
Maintaining that none of this money had entered into the 
party's safe, Kazan said he did not know how much money had been 
collected by party members and sympathizers. 
  Kazan added that they did not use banks to transfer the 
money 
which they handed to the Bosnians directly on certain occasions. 
He claimed that a representative of the Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic had always been present on these occasions. During 
a press conference on the subject on Thursday, Kazan 
contradicted his statement of the previous day that no bank had 
been used in the transfer of the money and produced bank dockets 
to prove that transfers had been made. 
  These appeared to go some way in allaying the accusations 
leveled at his party and left the field open to its accusers to 
produce the proof they claim to have. 
  The bank dockets he produced covered an estimated DM 2.5 
million as well as $73,000. 
  When asked why the money had been sent to a bank in Germany 
Kazan pointed to the name of the bank and asked reporters to 
investigate the matter for themselves. 
  He suggested that this was a bank account used by the 
Bosnians, although he did not clarify whether it was the Bosnian 
government he was referring to or other Bosnian groups. 
Repeating that his party had no direct connection with the 
gathering of funds for Bosnia, Kazan indicated that some members 
of the party had merely presided over the gathering of and 
transferring of funds for Bosnia as "observers." 
  He appeared to try and explain why it was that his party had 
these dockets if it was not directly involved in the gathering 
and transferring of aid as it claimed. 
  Kazan also distributed letters of thanks from Bosnian 
officials to the press in which the RP was thanked for aid that 
had been sent to Bosnia. 
  The Bosnian Ambassador Hayrudin Somum will hold a press 
conference this morning to clarify the situation from their side. 
  Following Kazan's disclosures on Wednesday eyes have now 
turned to Ciller and her government, who first leveled the 
accusation against the RP, to prove that their charges are 
correct. 
  Analysts say that if the prime minister cannot prove the 
allegation against the RP, this could be disastrous in terms of 
her image and could harm her party's prospects in the upcoming 
local elections.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 1 (AA) -- Labor and Social Security 
Minister Mehmet Mogultay, who is also acting as foreign 
minister, said on Tuesday [1 March] that Turkey will take 
initiatives to provide security for Palestinians. 
  Mogultay and Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk 
visited the Palestinian Embassy in Ankara and signed a memorial 
book which was dedicated to the 63 Palestinian victims of the 
Ibrahim Mosque massacre in Hebron by a Jewish settler last 
Friday. 
  Mogultay expressed condolences to Palestinian Ambassador 
Fu'ad Yasin over the incident. 
  Yasin called for international protection for the 
Palestinians living in Israel. Israel and the PLO signed a 
treaty in Washington on Sept. 13, 1993 that provides autonomy 
for the Palestinians living in the Gaza strip and the city of 
Jericho. 
  Mogultay said Israel and the PLO should continue a 
constructive dialogue as the peace process is in a critical 
point. 
  He said a lasting and peaceful solution should be found to 
the problem.

<F P=106> [Column by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Critical Decision on Baghdad"] </F>
  [Text] Turkey has arrived at the point where it must make 
two critical decisions on its foreign policy. The first is 
related to Iraq. 
  An Iraqi delegation headed by an under secretary visited 
Turkey at the end of December 1993. It invited Ozdem Sanberk, 
under secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, to visit 
Baghdad before it returned to Iraq. The Turkish Foreign 
Ministry is presently considering the way it will respond to 
that invitation. Until last night, the high-ranking officials 
were inclined to agree that Sanberk should visit Baghdad. 
However, the final decision will be adopted in the next few 
days. The decision is critical to Turkey because Ozdem 
Sanberk's arrival in Baghdad would be the first high-level visit 
by a Turkish official to Iraq since the Gulf War. Furthermore, 
it will pave the way for intensified relations between Turkey 
and Iraq. 
  However, Turkey's allies do not favor the establishment of 
high-level relations with Baghdad at this stage. Nevertheless, 
they are gradually becoming aware that Turkey's situation is 
different. 
  The current talks between Ankara and Baghdad seem only to be 
on the question of the oil pipeline between the two countries. 
Nevertheless, the question of northern Iraq continues to be a 
serious problem. Turkey wishes to convince Baghdad to adopt a 
more moderate approach on matters related to its citizens in 
northern Iraq. In short, Ozdem Sanberk's probable visit will be 
an important development. 
<H5>  Message to Denktas for a Solution </H5>
  In accordance with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's circular in 
January, a committee has been established to assess Turkey's 
foreign policy. Several ambassadors have been appointed as 
committee members. The committee will work under Prime Minister 
Ciller. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin and Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin are among its members. It plans to hold 
its first meeting on Turkey's policy on Cyprus at the beginning 
of the week. It will be recalled that in the United States some 
time ago Ciller promised to do whatever she could to contribute 
toward the solution of the Cyprus problem after the elections in 
north Cyprus. The elections have been held and a new government 
has been established in north Cyprus. In view of that, the time 
has come for Turkey to design its policy on the matter. 
President Demirel has invited President Rauf Denktas to visit 
Ankara. He will arrive on Tuesday, 22 February. 
<H5>  Time To Solve the Problem </H5>
  The committee met to assess Turkey's foreign policy at the 
beginning of the week. It decided that Rauf Denktas should be 
asked the following: "We have to adopt a decision on the policy 
we should maintain. Should we maintain the policy of 
no-solution or move to seek a solution to the problem?" 
  A high-ranking Turkish Foreign Ministry official said: "The 
no-solution situation is a solution. However, we have to 
decide." Turkey is convinced that a solution has to be found to 
the Cyprus problem. In fact, Deputy Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Bilgin Unan's visit to Nicosia in January to initiate 
backstage activities for the acceptance of UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali's proposals was the first indication of 
Turkey's approach in that direction. 
  The Turkish Cypriot side has recently taken positive steps. 
However, world public opinion is convinced that it is opposed to 
a solution of the problem. Obviously, several other steps must 
be taken to remove that impression. So, Denktas' visit may be 
an important turning point. Turkey is now convinced that 
concrete steps must be taken to resolve the Cyprus problem. 
That will be explained to Denktas in detail on Tuesday. 
  The question of Syria is the third point in Turkey's foreign 
policy that has aroused concern. Developments in domestic 
politics have overshadowed that problem. In view of that, 
little attention has been focused on whether or not President 
Clinton was able to influence President al-Asad when they met 
some time ago. A high-ranking official has said that President 
Clinton was able to do so. Intelligence reports Turkey has 
recently received indicate that Syria has seriously restricted 
Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leader Abdullah Ocalan's activities 
in that country. 
<H5>  Restrictions on Ocalan </H5>
  There are various rumors about Ocalan's whereabouts. He is 
reported to be living in a village between Syria and Lebanon. 
He has been informed that he must remain indoors during the day 
and avoid holding political talks. There are reports that the 
PKK camps in Syria have been closed down and the movement of PKK 
militants has been restricted. In short, Turkey's pressure 
seems to have achieved a certain degree of success. 
  Meanwhile, the Turkish Foreign Ministry is worried that 
Turkey may be subjected to intensive pressure by Western 
countries on matters related to the Kurdish problem. It seems 
that the first signs of that pressure have come from the United 
States. 
  In Germany, a motion on the Kurdish problem has recently 
been 
blocked in the Bundestag. Undoubtedly, it will be looked at 
again if a message is received from the United States. 
  All this indicates that Turkey has to concentrate more 
seriously not only on the question of Iraq and the Cyprus 
problem but also on the Kurdish problem in southeastern Anatolia.

  [Text] The Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] has 
issued a statement condemning the Greek parliament's decision 
declaring 19 May as the anniversary of the so-called Pontus 
massacre. 
  The political party groups jointly drafted a statement 
drawing the attention of world public opinion. The statement, 
which was read out by Mustafa Kalemli during today's session, is 
as follows: 
  The declaration of 19 May, which marks the beginning of the 
Turkish liberation struggle, as the anniversary of the so-called 
Pontus massacre by the Greek parliament reflects an extremely 
dangerous and warped mentality. We regret and condemn this 
meaningless and baseless decision of the Greek parliament. 
  The Greek parliament appears to have forgotten that 75 years 
ago Greece attacked Anatolia with the aim of eradicating the 
Turkish nation. We would like to remind world public opinion of 
the tyranny and barbarism applied by occupying Greece against 
innocent people in Anatolia between 1919 and 1920. The actions 
undertaken by Greece in Anatolia in violation of the law on wars 
have been documented by the Lausanne Treaty, which is a 
multilateral international document. 
  Given this situation, it is evident that the fact that the 
Greek parliament is turning hostile attitudes against Turkey 
into a state policy by distorting historical facts will merely 
undermine bilateral relations and regional peace. We ask the 
Greek parliament to display intelligence and common sense.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "G-7 Countries Call on Russia To </F>
Accelerate Economic Reforms"; as released by Brussels Textline 
database] 
  [Text] The slowness of the economic changes in Russia was 
the main subject at a meeting in Kronberg, near Frankfurt, of 
finance ministers and governors of central banks of the G-7 with 
the Russian ministers for finance and the economy and the 
governor of Russia's central bank, and representatives from the 
IMF, the World Bank and the European Commission, represented by 
its Vice-President Henning-Christophersen. In a report on the 
debates by German Minister Theo Waigel, the Seven affirmed "with 
insistence that energetic economic reform is the only path to 
guarantee the advantages of a market economy." They stressed 
their "concern over the lack of progress in stabilizing the 
Russian economy." According to Mr. Waigel's text, the Russian 
delegation assured them that the budgetary deficit would be 
limited to around 5 percent of GNP in 1994 and that the monthly 
price rises would be would be brought down to between 7 and 9 
percent by the end of the year. The Seven said that they were 
ready to unblock parts of the financial package of around $45 
billion adopted last year but that the money which had not yet 
been paid out could only be so "when all the conditions had been 
met." The Seven however made some concessions to the Russians, 
saying that they agreed with them in saying that special 
attention had to be given to the consequences of the 
transformation process. They believed that a credible social 
accompanying program was required. The Seven are ready for a 
"new wide recycling agreement" of the Russian debt "on the basis 
of a program supported by the International Monetary Fund." 
They recall that Russia's public creditors had granted it 
further respite by extending by four months, until the end of 
April, the recycling accord negotiated with the former USSR in 
April 1993. After the meeting, Mr. Waigel told the press: "It 
was a realistic discussion." 
  British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke added: 
"We applied pressure on them over monetary policy." Mr. 
Christophersen declared that the IMF which always called for 
very strict reforms before releasing credits, could not make an 
exemption for Russia. For his part, Mr. Alexander Chikhine, 
Russian Minister for the Economy, said that the meeting with the 
G-7 was a "specific moment", as it was the first one since the 
Russian elections and the reshuffle of Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's Government. The Kronberg meeting also served the 
G-7 to make a relatively optimistic observation over the 
situation in the world economy. This part of the talks was not 
the subject of a communique. Italian Finance Minister Piero 
Barucci said that the end of the recession was in sight, except 
possibly in Germany. The Japanese ministers denied any 
isolation of their country within the G-7. "Even if we did not 
say so in the Communique, there was common agreement in 
considering that fluctuations in parities are not desirable. We 
confirmed that the G-7 would continue to cooperate," said 
Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. According to Mr. Hans 
Tietemeyer, Bundesbank president, the monetary issues had not 
led "controversy." 
  Recognizing that there "had practically been no discussion 
on 
currencies," Mr. Yasushi Mieno, Governor of the Bank of Japan, 
considered that Japan's partners "understood that the strong 
appreciation of the yen undermined the efforts the archipelago 
is undertaking to assure economic recovery."

<F P=106> [Article signed CET: "Sweden Agrees to Join EU"; as released </F>
by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 1 Mar (BELGA) -- Swedish European Affairs 
Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel said that he was satisfied with his 
country's agreement with the EU [European Union]. It is an 
historic day for Sweden, he added. 
  The agreement constitutes a good basis for carrying out the 
referendum on Sweden's accession to the EU, especially since the 
opposition was closely involved in the negotiations. 
  The minister reported that Sweden's net budget contribution 
will not exceed ECU50 million in the first year. Without the 
compensation, it would have amounted to about ECU760 million. 
  For the second year, Sweden's net budget contribution will 
rise to ECU150 million. The following year, the contribution 
will be significantly higher and by the fourth year, Sweden will 
have to pay its full contribution. 
  Dinkelspiel said that a couple of issues still remain to be 
settled. The Twelve have not reached an agreement regarding the 
voting procedure in the European Ministerial Council. Spain and 
the United Kingdom want to make it easier for large countries to 
block a decision. Furthermore, Spain does not want the new 
members to participate in the 1996 final settlement of the 
European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). 
  The European Treaty envisages the third and last phase of 
the 
EMU starting in 1997 with the single currency and the European 
Central Bank, provided that a majority of the member states 
comply with the conditions. 
  Spain wants the treaty to be modified, clearly stating that 
all decisions must be made by a majority of the current 12 
member states. 
  Belgium and most member states have rejected the Spanish 
proposal. The issues have not been discussed so far, however. 
Thus, the position of the new member states in the future EMU is 
not clearly defined.
