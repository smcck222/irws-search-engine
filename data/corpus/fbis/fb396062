  [Text] The Dutch parliament wants politicians and military 
commanders in former Yugoslavia to stand trial at the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague for their share in 
setting up concentration camps. So far there's been only talk 
of prosecuting low-ranking army officials for such war crimes. 
  Some members of Dutch parliament claim that the worst 
criminals in former Yugoslavia are not those wearing uniforms 
but those who put on suits to attend peace negotiations. The 
special tribunal at the International Court of Justice in The 
Hague is to start conducting its first trials this year.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pronk Cancels Trip to Sudan"] </F>
  [Text] The Hague -- Development Aid Minister Pronk will not 
be going to Sudan next week because the Sudanese Government in 
Khartoum does not intend to support him in his attempts to 
mediate in the civil war. The minister does not have the 
feeling that he could move around freely in that country, 
explained his spokesman. 
  Pronk had intended to travel from southern Sudan to 
resistance groups in the Nuba Mountains, but he was denied 
permission to land there in a light aircraft. Last year, Pronk 
visited the Nuba Mountains, but on that occasion the journey was 
under government control. When he returned to the Netherlands, 
Pronk let it be known that the human rights situation in the 
Nuba Mountains had improved. 
  Quite a different conclusion was reached by a Hungarian 
rapporteur for the UN Committee on Human Rights, Mr. Gaspar Biro 
[name as published]. The Sudanese Government is furious about 
the report, which was discussed this week in the UN Committee 
and is accusing Biro of blasphemy, but the European Union 
praised his sound, impartial report. Pronk informed the 
Sudanese ambassador this week that the Netherlands also 
supported the Biro report. 
  Already during his last visit, Pronk had asked whether he 
himself might come into contact with the leaders of the various 
parties to the conflict in the south. This morning, Pronk 
informed Sudanese Ambassador Siddiq of his decision to call off 
the trip. During their conversation, the minister said he would 
not give up in his attempts to act as a mediator in the civil 
war.

<F P=106> [Philip Johnston report: "Loyal Heseltine Keeps His Options </F>
Open"] 
  [Text] Mr Michael Heseltine left open the option yesterday 
of a bid for the Conservative Party leadership if a vacancy 
arose, but he made clear he would do nothing to undermine Mr 
John Major, who he believed would lead the party into the next 
election. 
  The President of the Board of Trade, who failed in his 
challenge for the leadership in 1990 after toppling Lady 
Thatcher, sought to dampen recent speculation about his own 
rekindled ambitions in a lengthy BBC radio interview. It 
coincided with an attempt by Mr Michael Howard, the Home 
Secretary and a leading Cabinet Rightwinger, to bolster Mr 
Major's position and implicitly challenge Mr Heseltine's 
credentials as a potential Prime Minister on grounds of age. 
  "I want John Major to be Prime Minister for a very long 
time," Mr Howard said. "I believe he will be Prime Minister for 
a long time, and when the time comes for him to hand over to 
someone else, I do not think it will be to an older man." 
  As Mr Major is 50, this would rule out Mr Heseltme, 60, Mr 
Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, who is 53, and Mr Howard himself. 
  Asked on BBC television's "Breakfast With Frost" whether he 
would like to be Prime Minister, Mr Howard, 52, replied: "I have 
given my answer. When John Major gives up, he won't be handing 
over to an older man." 
  Mr Heseltine was asked on BBC Radio's "The World this 
Weekend" whether he was ruling out contesting the leadership. 
He sald: "I am telling you quite categorically that I believe 
John Major will remain in place. I am not prepared to be 
involved in any speculation about my own position because I 
intend to go on helping him win the political battles that the 
Conservatives have to fight. I believe he will do that and lead 
us to victory at the next election. 
  ``I do not think there is any question of there being a 
vacancy and I don't think there is any profit in analysing what 
would happen if there was. My position is clear. John Major 
has entrusted me with one of the jobs I most wanted. I will do 
it to the best of my ability, because I believe Britain has a 
very exciting opportunity.'' 
  He added: "I have made it quite clear that my role in 
history 
is creating rather a good garden. That is where I have spent 
the morning." 
  However, Mr Heseltine was careful to avoid any definitive 
statement on his own position should a vacancy arise. He has 
made a good recovery from the heart attack that seemed to have 
put paid to his career last summer, and there are many in the 
party who would turn to him if the Tories needed a new leader. 
  Although he is privately irritated about the renewed gossip 
at Westminster about his ambitions, Mr Heseltine's supporters 
believe he would be ill-advised to rule himself out at the start 
of a year which is certain to see renewed pressure on Mr Major 
if the Tories perform disastrously in the local authority and 
European Parliament elections. 
  The re-emergence of Mr Heseltine as a serious contender for 
the leadership following his performance at the Scott inquiry 
last week has sufficiently alarmed his detractors to prompt 
reports of a "Stop Michael" campaign gathering ground at 
Westminster. 
  Some MPs are suggesting he should be appointed party 
chairman 
after the European elections in June, in which the Conservatives 
could lose up to a dozen seats. They argue this would exploit 
Mr Heseltine's political talents to the full while "lashing him 
to the mast" of Mr Major's leadership . 
  There have also been signs that Mr Heseltine has been trying 
to make himself more acceptable to the party Right, especially 
over Europe. 
  In a speech last week he was critical of the "Eurosclerosis" 
in Brussels over the implementation of the European single 
market. 
  "My preoccupation is to help, in every way I can, the Prime 
Minister's determination that, in being at the heart of Europe, 
we shall influence the thinking of Europe in a way that will 
make Europe more competitive and richer and therefore make 
Britain better off," he said yesterday. 
  The Tory approach to Europe in this June's elections will 
try 
to chart a course through the divisions in the party. 
  However, Sir Edward Heath, the former Prime Minister, said 
it 
would be a "serious mistake" if the views of the "Euro-sceptics" 
held sway. 
  The sceptics would not be satisfied with anything less than 
the break-up of the whole thing, he said on ITV's Walden 
programme.

  [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus arrived in London 
this afternoon for a two-day official visit to the United 
Kingdom. This is his third visit to Britain in the office of 
Czech prime minister, although this is the first official one. 
A few minutes ago we received a video about the talks held 
between Prime Minister Klaus and British Prime Minister John 
Major. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister Klaus opened his first 
official visit to Great Britain since the establishment of the 
independent Czech state with a meeting with British Prime 
Minister John Major. Before the talks began, Prime Minister 
Klaus said that the chief purpose of the meeting was to confirm 
views on certain questions of a bilateral and Europe-wide 
character. At the same time he said he shares the somewhat less 
pro-federal view of British politicians on the future set-up in 
Europe. 
  The talks betweem the prime ministers at 10 Downing Street, 
where British prime ministers have had their residence since 
1735, lasted about one hour. After the talks ended Prime 
Minister Klaus said, among other things: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] As regards bilateral relations, we 
considered that there are no significant problems which the 
prime ministers should tackle. Therefore the subject of our 
talks was of course Bosnia, Europe, European communities, the 
gradual integration of our country in European communities, and 
the Partnership for Peace, which the British Goverment really 
regards as a mechanism for our entry into NATO. We discussed 
the issue of the OECD, an organization which I believe offers a 
more realistic way for our country's rapid entry into European 
structures than some other organizations. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister Klaus has also given a 
lecture 
at the British Royal Institute for Foreign Affairs on the 
subject of the transformation of Czech society and its 
Europe-wide context. He repeated his view that of all the 
postcommunist countries the Czech Republic has gone the farthest 
in its reformist endeavors. At the same time he said that in 
this situation the West should not cease to seek an optimal 
method for the integration of the postcommunist structures. 
  At this moment the Czech prime minister is meeting with the 
chairman of the British Conservative Party, Sir Norman Fowler.

  [Text] The successful outcome of membership negotiations 
between the European Union [EU] and the applicant countries is a 
cause for celebration. Referendums and European Parliament 
permitting, Austria, Sweden and Finland should be able to join 
at the start of next year. The only regret is that Norway has, 
as yet, been unable to agree terms. 
  The accession of all four states would be a cultural, 
political and economic boost to the Union. These countries 
share the EU's democratic values and each will extend the 
Union's diplomatic reach into new areas of the Third World. The 
EU would also gain much from closer links with the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The German plan to 
secure for these countries some stake in EU decision-making by 
the end of the year merits the strongest support. 
  Establishing this close relationship will not be easy. The 
EU may find itself taking on a financial burden it can ill 
afford. But it is a risk worth taking. For it would underwrite 
the introduction of democracy to these states and provide a 
measure of the security they were denied when their applications 
to join NATO were rejected. They would also be encouraged to 
push ahead with developing market economies. 
  Our continent, too, would be stronger. Instead of two blocs, 
one wealthy and self-centred, the other poor and envious, there 
will be a chance to build a community in which prosperity is 
shared. 
  Enlargement also has considerable implications for the way 
the Union is governed. While there were only six, nine or even 
12 members, it was possible to argue the case for a centralised 
Union. Even when the Union was small, the desirability of this 
goal was questionable; with 20 members, it is not even a 
practical possibility. 
  The Union has a choice: it could become a loose 
confederation of nation states which worked closely together in 
a single economic market and operated together as a political 
unit when there was a consensus. This approach is favoured by 
Denmark and Britain. 
  The alternative is a federal structure where many matters 
ranging from drinking water to education, which the Union is now 
involved in, would be the sole responsibility of member states. 
Control of the major issues, including foreign, monetary and 
economic policy, would be conducted on a supranational level. 
This would be feasible only if implemented on majority voting 
with countries losing their right of veto. 
  The future of the Union is too important a question to be 
left to the politicians. There must be the widest possible 
democratic debate across the Union. There must be an attempt to 
build a democratic consensus. Our politicians should tell us 
openly what kind of Union they wish to see. They must then try 
to persuade us to accept their vision.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Widening Europe's Horizons"] </F>
  [Text] The successful conclusion of negotiations between 
Brussels and three of the applicants for EC membership will 
furnish the Community with much needed momentum in the wake of 
Maastricht and the fiasco of former Yugoslavia. The deals 
accepted by Austria, Finland and Sweden on Tuesday [1 March] -- 
with Norway expected to follow suit next week -- prepare the way 
for the inclusion of countries with strong democratic traditions 
and economies which will make a net contribution to EC funds. 
Their accession, scheduled for January 1 next year, will open 
the door to the East European applicants, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The widening of the Community, 
espoused by successive British governments, is on the verge of 
taking place. 
  There is, however, a furlong or two to go before the 
finishing line. First, the Commission and Oslo must resolve 
their differences over access to Norwegian waters for Spanish 
fishermen. Second, the Community has to decide whether to 
change the current system of qualified majority voting when the 
new members join. Third, the agreements reached in Brussels are 
subject to referenda in the applicant countries. According to 
the opinion polls, those in favour of membership outnumber 
opponents in Austria and Finland, but not in Sweden and Norway. 
  If all goes well, by next year the Community will form the 
largest economic unit in the world, a market of 372 million 
people with a combined gross domestic product of $6,700 billion. 
As the date approaches for the Maastricht review conference in 
1996, those countries, such as Britain, which remain sceptical 
about the treaty's goals should find in the new Scandinavian 
members useful allies in curbing federalist ambitions. The 
enlargement, the first since Spain and Portugal joined in 1986, 
is to be welcomed.

  [Text] Bonn/Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- Environment Minister Klaus 
Toepfer has rejected criticism from the environmental 
organization Greenpeace in connection with the export of 480 
tonnes of pesticide toxic waste to Albania. There is "nothing 
to hide" in this matter, Toepfer said today in Bonn. The 
Hanover firm of Schmidt-Cretan exported pesticides from the 
former GDR to Albania as "humanitarian aid" from 1991 to 1992. 
  Greenpeace accused the Environment Ministry of "hindering 
the 
due process of law." An experts' report last year spoke of an 
"explosive risk situation" and recommended that the German 
Government see to the "immediate securing" of the toxic waste 
freight. Neither the German criminal investigation authorities 
nor the Albanian authorities were given access to the report. 
  Toepfer said that the Lower Saxony criminal investigation 
office and the Federal Criminal Investigation Bureau has been 
informed about the report by phone. Experts from the German 
Technical Support Service established in situ in Albania that 
there is no immediate danger to the environment. Moreover, the 
export is legal. However, efforts will be made to find a 
"national solution." 
  Greenpeace expert Andreas Bernstorff said that the toxic 
substances are a danger to the population. If Toepfer wants a 
national solution, he will have to bring the toxic freight back 
to Germany as quickly as possible to dispose of it here. 
Greenpeace has itself secured the greater part of the toxic 
waste against the risk of explosion and leakage. Moreover, it 
organized the return transport of approximately 1,000 kg of the 
pesticides. The truck will arrive in Germany in the next few 
days. Further return transport is not planned, however, 
contrary to other statements made by Greenpeace staff.

  [Text] Chancellor Helmut Kohl is to save an important 
large order for the Daimler-Benz subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace 
(Dasa). Together with their European Airbus partners, the 
Germans want to deliver planes for approximately 10 billion 
German marks to Saudi Arabia. However, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton announced that Saudi Arabia will buy the planes from the 
U.S. companies Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. As a result, Dasa 
Chief Juergen Schrempp sent a begging letter to the chancellors. 
"Since we know that the negotiations in Saudi Arabia have not 
yet been finally concluded," the letter says, Kohl should 
advocate the Europeans' cause. In Dasa alone, almost 1,300 jobs 
have to be abolished by 1997, if the order is lost. "Only a 
personal intervention by yourself," Schrempp wrote in clumsy 
German, could "bring about at least a partial turnaround." The 
chancellor has not yet reacted. He is angry with Schrempp and 
his colleagues. Over the past months, they have repeatedly 
criticized the Federal Government harshly for drastically 
reducing research subsidies for aviation and space flight.

  [Text] Potsdam (DDP/ADN): The first direct satellite link 
in the civilian sector between Brandenburg and Russia went into 
operation today. A 2.5 metre dish in Golm on a building of 
Potsdam University is connected to the Dubna nuclear research 
institute near Moscow. The institute in Dubna will have access 
to international scientific networks via the Potsdam link. The 
Institut fuer ComputerIntegriertes Engineering (CoIn) [Institute 
of computer-integrated engineering] in Potsdam is involved on 
the German side. EuroDATA Berlin, which established the 
communications needs of both sides on behalf of the state of 
Brandenburg, provides the service. Both the Dubna institute and 
the satellite project are supported by the Federal Research 
Ministry. 
  Presently, 64,000 bits per second can be transmitted. 
According to the Brandenburg Transport Ministry, the system is 
to be expanded technically and related systems for links to Kiev 
and Minsk added to it. Scientists will thus gradually have 
better opportunities for exchanging data and pictures, and using 
future systems they will be able to hold video conferences.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Fritz Wirth: "Whitewater, High Water"] </F>
  [Text] He who wants to be a president of change, as Bill 
Clinton promised his voters, is automatically a president of 
pain. Abandoning a certain routine and a past that has become 
too easy usually involves a great deal of pain. Ironically 
enough, so far no one has suffered more from Bill Clinton's 
changes than the president himself and some of his closest 
aides. The most noticeable change at the White House is a 
strong touch of provincialism. The guard of advisers that he 
brought from Arkansas threatens to fail because of the tough 
climate in Washington. There has already been one suicide. 
  The provincial troop has plunged Clinton into his deepest 
crisis to date. In fact, the Whitewater affair that stems from 
his office as governor in Arkansas cannot be compared with the 
scandals that became a legend, including Watergate and the 
Iran-Contra affair. However, it is more than a harmless episode, 
as Clinton is trying to pretend. 
  His protests of innocence are no longer effective because he 
himself is to blame for the current crisis. Intensive efforts 
were made to influence a legal process. Clinton's credibility 
has suffered in this respect. If he really is innocent, then 
there is no need for intensive manipulations by his advisers 
aimed at influencing legal investigations. 
  With great certainty, we do not know yet the whole truth in 
this affair, which is not only embarrassing for the president 
himself but also for First Lady Hillary, who is apparently more 
deeply involved in the affair than has been known so far. Her 
contacts with legal adviser Nussbaum, who has now been 
dismissed, date back to the Watergate days. 
  In any event, the nation is viewing this affair with 
increasing confusion and concern. It senses for the first time 
the price for the most evident change that has taken place after 
the Clintons entered the White House: It is having two 
presidents at the same time.

  [Text] The United States and Japan are again on the 
warpath regarding trade policies. The U.S. Administration 
demands exact minimum import quotas for certain U.S. products 
from the Japanese in Tokyo. The Japanese Government rejects 
this. It is understandable that in the long run the United 
States is concerned about the horrendous Japanese trade 
surpluses with their own country. However, it is not convincing 
to claim again and again that the Japanese market is closed. 
Since the European auto industry sold altogether 1.1 million 
vehicles in Japan by the end of last year, the reasons for the 
failure of the U.S. automakers to sell more U.S. cars in Japan 
are to be found elsewhere. One cannot talk of free world trade 
if products that are hard to sell are to be pressed into a 
market in the form of minimum import quotas, as the U.S. 
Administration is trying to do in Japan. At the same time, one 
must not fail to see that every solution to that effect finally 
has to burden suppliers from third countries -- that is, exactly 
the European industry. Minimum import quotas are a bad relapse 
into foreign trade regulated by the state.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Phillipe Seguin, president of the </F>
French parliament: "`We've Had To Pay for That'"] 
  [Text] Phillipe Seguin was the spokesman for the 
French opponents of the Maastricht Treaty, who barely lost in 
the European referendum on 20 September 1992 with 48.95 percent. 
The campaign, which peaked in a TV debate with President 
Francois Mitterrand, made a national figure of the former social 
minister. In public opinion polls a year after the referendum, 
54 percent of the French people declared themselves in favor of 
the Seguin line against Maastricht. Born in Tunis, Seguin, whose 
father had died in action in 1944 as a volunteer in de Gaulle's 
army, worked on behalf of an open, leftist Gaullism. Because of 
his protectionist tendencies, the mayor of Epinal, whom LE MONDE 
characterized as "le colosse," was reproached for being a 
nationalist and populist. Following the election victory of the 
right wing in March 1993, the popular, self-confident 
nonconformist took on the office of president of the parliament 
instead of heading up a ministry. From this politically neutral 
base, Seguin, 50, could become a compromise candidate of the 
right wing for the presidential elections in 1995--in the event 
that the top candidates, Jacques Chirac and Edouard Belladur, 
block one another. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. President, when you were six years old, 
you 
accepted a medal on behalf of your father, who had been killed 
by the Germans in France in 1944. Have your pain and memories of 
this time shaped your attitude toward the Germans? 
  [Seguin] My father died in a war. I have never felt ill will 
toward the Germans. Quite to the contrary: The memory was a 
special incentive for me to work for reconciliation and 
cooperation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The usual harmony between Bonn and Paris has 
given way to a kind of disenchantment of late. Is the 
German-French relationship damaged? 
  [Seguin] There have always been differences of opinion and 
difficult periods. But I don't see any reason for alarm just 
now. Our special relationship arose during the Cold War. Thus we 
have to put it on a new basis now. Germany is no longer in the 
position it was in during the sixties, and France is beset by 
moral doubts that have thrown it into an identity crisis. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Both states suspect one another of national 
egoism. The Germans accuse the French of selfishness and 
protectionism. The French are suspicious that the Germans have 
been seized once again by the drive to the east. Do the two 
partners still have a common concept of Europe? 
  [Seguin] The end of the Cold War changed the old roles. Many 
of the French fear a return of German nationalism. 
Paradoxically, the most ardent French proponents of the 
Maastricht Treaty used the argument that Germany had to be 
contained. We French are displeased by the occasional German 
reproach that we have a Grande Nation complex. We stand before a 
turning point of history. There is thus indecision in the two 
countries concerning the future path. But this onset of 
insecurity is not dramatic. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The opposition by President Francois 
Mitterrand 
to German unification perplexed, even shocked many Germans. Were 
Mitterrand's delaying tactics a mistake? 
  [Seguin] Yes, and we have had to pay for that. I, too, was 
very shocked that in the symbol-laden moment of the fall of the 
Berlin Wall, the reaction of the French head of state was to 
first pay a visit, during a curious tour, to those who in East 
Berlin wanted to maintain the GDR, and then in Kiev to induce 
Gorbachov to join an alliance of opponents to German unity. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Doesn't that show that France had gotten to 
like the division of Germany? 
  [Seguin] We should have shared the joy of the Germans, and 
that was also the spontaneous feeling of many French citizens 
when they saw what was taking place on the Wall in November 
1989. On the other hand, the Germans probably wouldn't have 
completed the unification so hastily, so precipitately, if they 
hadn't felt this antipathy, if not to say hostility, on the part 
of their most important European partner. They believed they had 
to move quickly to create irrevocable facts. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In any case, Mitterrand did not try--as 
Margaret Thatcher later accused him in her memoirs--to block 
German unity. Didn't his ambivalent behavior nevertheless create 
lasting mistrust? 
  [Seguin] I hope not, but in the aftermath our concepts of 
the 
makeup of Europe in particular have changed. From that point on, 
we urged acceleration of the establishment of the European 
Union. In this way we wanted to counteract all the dangers that 
could arise from German unification. This haste was our second 
mistake. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But Chancellor Kohl participated in this as 
well. Maastricht was to be the compensation, the tranquilizer 
pill, for German unity. 
  [Seguin] The way things were handled didn't do a service for 
the development of Europe. The reason may have been that the 
responsible politicians belong to generations that were marked 
by history. Only this can explain the all too famous remark by 
Francois Mauriac: "I love Germany so much that I am happy there 
are two of them." 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How long will this kind of thinking last? 
  [Seguin] It no longer exists in my generation. Even if my 
struggle against the Maastricht Treaty was not understood 
correctly in Germany at the outset--I resisted the idea of 
imbedding Germany in Europe, because that is a curious way of 
keeping up friendly relations. The notion that the European 
Union was an instrument for containing Germany was publicly 
espoused even by such serious-minded politicians as the former 
Socialist prime minister, Michel Rocard. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will the Paris-Bonn axis hold, or does it need 
new bearings--less sentimentality, a greater convergence of 
interests? 
  [Seguin] We have to renew it without abandoning the 
emotional 
ingredient. It is reassuring that for a long time relations, 
beyond the level of government, have become a matter of the 
peoples.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...despite the occasionally flickering fear of 
the French people that the old German demons could be 
resurrected? 
  [Seguin] As far as right-wing extremism in general is 
concerned, the French people have no lessons to teach the 
Germans. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] As the leader of the Maastricht opponents, who 
barely lost the European referendum in September 1992, you are 
living in a Europe that is not the way you wanted it. Is your 
struggle for a different Europe continuing? 
  [Seguin] I lost in the referendum, but I ask myself whether 
this defeat was not a victory in many respects. I basically feel 
that one could have concluded the Maastricht Treaty in its 
present form even in the days before Leonid Brezhnev.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...and Erich Honecker? 
  [Seguin] Yes, and without changing a single line of the 
treaty text. If we first limited Europe to six, then nine, then 
12 partners, we did so because the Iron Curtain divided the 
continent. If Europe's founding fathers--Adenauer, de Gaulle, 
Monnet, De Gasperi, and the others--had lived under present-day 
conditions, they would not have started out with six, but would 
have considered a quite different number. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So, the European Union should expand to the 
East? 
  [Seguin] Definitely. I also think that prosperity in the 
West 
will depend on how much we help the East in its development. I 
dream of a kind of West European Marshall Plan for East 
Europe.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...for the time being, this will probably 
remain just a dream. The European Union would certainly be 
taking on too much if it integrated the East European countries 
precipitately. The Brussels consensus is: intensify instead of 
enlarge. 
  [Seguin] The one thing is not incompatible with the other. 
The European Community originally set itself three goals: First, 
to create peace between the arch enemies; second, to contribute 
to prosperity; third, to influence the world together. Whoever 
wanted to join had to have a democratic government. Thus, there 
were only six partners at the outset, because Greece, Spain, and 
Portugal were not democracies, and Britain did not want to 
subscribe to the common goals. When these countries were later 
accepted, economic criteria hardly played a role. Otherwise, 
Greece would never have been allowed to join. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And Spain and Portugal wouldn't have been 
accepted either. Nevertheless, Europe could not now afford 
financially to expand to include the Eastern countries. It would 
have to forget the desired economic and currency union. 
  [Seguin] Naturally, we cannot bring everything about 
overnight. We would not be doing the Eastern countries any 
favors in doing so. First we have to help them to organize 
economically, but also guarantee that they will become members 
over the long term, even if that takes three or four decades. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That sounds different. And what place are you 
reserving for Russia in your Europe? 
  [Seguin] What to do with Russia is a problem as old as 
Europe, and it can be summarized in one question: Is Russia 
really European? I think that is an open question for the time 
being. But in any case we have to help Russia to become a part 
of Europe. A phenomenon like Shironovsky was made possible 
because Europe does not have a decisive foreign policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The European Union has to define its position 
not only toward Russia but toward America as well. Can the 
Atlantic alliance survive in its present form? 
  [Seguin] I think NATO has outlived its usefulness. America's 
disengagement has already begun. The number of U.S. troops 
stationed in Europe will be reduced to around 100,000. In the 
long run, public opinion in America will demand that these 
troops be brought home and that Europe be left to its own 
devices. Europe has to become grown up enough to take care of 
its own security, in friendship and alliance with the United 
States. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Would France be prepared to make its nuclear 
power--a symbol of its greatness and independence--a part of a 
joint European defense policy? 
  [Seguin] France has to rethink its military policy. But 
France's nuclear power must never be jeopardized. Therefore, I 
belong to those who call for the resumption of our nuclear 
testing. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mitterrand allowed the tests to be suspended 
in 
April 1992--a bow to the pacifists? 
  [Seguin] Vicious tongues maintain he ordered that because he 
thought he could win the political support of the 
environmentalists. Besides, the president apparently believes 
our nuclear weapons are technically on a high enough 
level--which many experts challenge. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But this nuclear power is to remain 
exclusively 
under national command? 
  [Seguin] We should discuss with our European partners which 
forms of consultation and cooperation can be used in the event 
of operational engagement, and how the force de frappe can be 
reconciled with a common foreign and security policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Like other European countries, France is 
experiencing a crisis of direction--anxiety over unemployment, 
waves of immigration and a rising crime rate, and disaffection 
from politics. Does the Socialist Mitterrand have to first step 
down--his term in office ends in 1995--before the right wing 
governing together with him can introduce a real change? 
  [Seguin] Yes. That is not possible before he does so. Our 
political system functions in such a way that only presidential 
elections can decide the really big questions of the nation. 
They decide policy for the next seven years--for the duration of 
the presidential mandate. We are thus still living within the 
framework set by the election of Mitterrand in 1988. Despite the 
victory of the right wing in the parliamentary elections last 
March, the Balladur government is only a transitional 
government.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...that therefore cannot deal with the crisis? 
  [Seguin] We are experiencing a moral crisis, a cultural 
crisis, an identity crisis. We are seeking our role, our future, 
France's road. We can only hope that the 1995 presidential 
elections will provide the impetus to find answers, to set a new 
course. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] First-time voters, who are 18 or 20 years old, 
cannot remember any president other than Mitterrand. Doesn't a 
seven-year mandate, which can also be renewed, have to lead to 
political paralysis? 
  [Seguin] If we shorten the seven-year period, we necessarily 
end up with a regular presidential system of the American kind, 
with the simultaneous election of the president and the 
parliament. But our constitution was designed along 
parliamentary, not presidential lines. I don't believe that 
shortening the term in office to four or five years would 
produce any advantages. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The president is the supreme commander. He can 
remove the prime minister, dissolve parliament, influence 
day-to-day policy of the government. Isn't that too much power? 
  [Seguin] The problem lies less in the institutions of the 
Fifth Republic than in its undesirable developments. The 
government that had the greatest room for maneuver in France 
after the war was paradoxically the first cabinet of Charles de 
Gaulle with Michel Debre as prime minister, although the general 
was indeed an overpowering personality. But he concerned himself 
only with diplomacy and the Army--at the time there was also the 
war in Algeria. Everything else, all domestic policy, he left to 
the government. He did not get involved in the work of the 
government. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That means that Mitterrand keeps a tighter 
rein 
on the country than de Gaulle did in his day? 
  [Seguin] From de Gaulle to Georges Pompidou and Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing to Mitterrand, the presidency has taken on 
increasingly monarchic characteristics. It would be desirable if 
things returned to their original condition. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is Gaullism a doctrine with which France can 
proceed into the 21st century? 
  [Seguin] When I look at people of my generation who caused 
the turmoil of May 1968--Maoists, Socialists, Communists, and 
what not--I consider myself very lucky that I followed the ideas 
of de Gaulle, that I never fought for ideas. that lay outside 
the bounds of reality. The general foresaw what is taking place 
in Europe today. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] De Gaulle gathered left-wing and right-wing 
people around him. In the meantime, the conservatives have 
grabbed Gaullism for themselves. How do you view the general's 
legacy today? 
  [Seguin] Just as the principles of the constitution have 
gradually shifted, Gaullism, too, has shifted to the right. That 
is regrettable because it isn't consistent with the essence of 
Gaullism. Gaullism stands for a certain commitment to the 
nation--not for an egoistic, secluded, anxious, and thus 
outwardly aggressive nation, but for a nation as the fundamental 
bulwark of democracy and the foundation of a strong feeling of 
community. Gaullism is the victory over the conflict between 
left and right in the name of national solidarity. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you consider yourself a pure Gaullist? 
  [Seguin] I hope I am. In any case, people say I am when they 
want to speak ill of me. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Gaullists are again in the majority in the 
government, but its base is largely no longer reflected in the 
policies of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Why is Balladur 
nevertheless so popular? 
  [Seguin] There is doubtless a contradiction between the 
personal popularity of Balladur and the relative unpopularity of 
the government's policies. He is the opposite of the Socialists 
who ruled before him. He speaks sensibly and makes no empty 
promises, and the people's weariness with politics works in his 
favor. Balladur embodies values in which the French seek refuge 
in their moral crisis. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you know who your candidate will be for the 
presidential election in 1995? 
  [Seguin] My, what an indiscreet question! I will support the 
candidate who is most closely associated with my ideas. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That would be you.... 
  [Seguin] ...You can insert three dots at this point. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If you could draw a picture of the ideal 
president for the future France, what would be his most 
important characteristics? 
  [Seguin] Such a picture could resemble someone you think you 
recognize. He will surely be a Gaullist. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And what do you expect of him? 
  [Seguin] Even if the expression doesn't seem happily chosen, 
owing to the historical example, I hope he introduces a real 
cultural revolution in France that will attack a whole series of 
problems--from European policy to combating unemployment to 
education. We have a lot to do if we are to preserve and develop 
our model of civilization.

<F P=106> ["ink"-signed report: "Good Sales Opportunities for German </F>
Machine-Building Industry in China"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 6 March -- China [PRC] has developed 
into a lucrative market for the German machine-building 
industry. According to the German Machine-Building and 
Plant-Construction Association, just under 40 percent of all 
German exports to the People's Republic consists of machines. 
In the first nine months of last year, machines and plant worth 
approximately 3.2 billion German marks [DM] were exported to 
China. Total German exports involved about DM6.4 billion. 
According to the Association's estimates, exports in the 
machine-building sector will reach DM3.5 billion for the whole 
year. 
  In the past 15 years, the export of machines to China 
increased constantly, with some fluctuations. Whereas the 
export volume of German machines and plants to China was still 
DM1 billion in 1980, it increased, after a slight fall, to DM2.4 
billion in 1985 and to DM3.2 billion in 1986. The reservation 
of German exporters was clearly noticeable in the three years 
after the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in June 1989, 
when the volume dropped again to below DM2 billion. The 
majority -- a quarter -- of German machines exported to this 
East Asian country are textile machines, followed by machine 
tools (18 percent), and packaging and food-processing machines 
(8 percent). 
  Trade with China has changed fundamentally since the country 
opened up. Whereas German exporters had to negotiate the 
conditions of their deliveries to China with 10 to 12 foreign 
trade offices at the end of the 1970's, when the Chinese 
Government adopted the first cautious reform measures, it is now 
possible to contact Chinese buyers directly. Step by step, 
large and later medium-sized and small enterprises were granted 
permission to negotiate directly with foreign partners. In 
addition, the country relaxed its foreign exchange regulations 
considerably and standardized the exchange rate on 1 January 
this year. However, "this is unfavorable for Chinese 
enterprises that import goods," stated Ruiquan Cheng, secretary 
general of the "Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society," an 
association of 4,000 machine-building enterprises and 17,000 
engineers. After the standardization of the exchange rate, the 
Chinese enterprises no longer enjoy the former privileges for 
the exchange of Chinese renminbi against dollars or German 
marks. However, the impact on the country's imports is still 
unclear. 
  According to the secretary general, German enterprises are 
still too little known and their presence is not sufficient in 
the Chinese market. As far as machines and plants are 
concerned, Japanese exporters accounted for 35 percent in 1992 
(more recent data are not available). The Germans only supplied 
17 percent of the Chinese imports in this sector. Still, German 
enterprises are doing quite well in this area. Before the 
United States, they were the second-largest supplier of machines 
to the PRC.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F>
Heribert Prantl and Ulrich Deupmann; place and date not given: 
"One Will Find Oneself Standing With One's Empty Words in an 
Empty Room"] 
  [Text] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When you took office eight 
months ago you promised that internal security would not become 
an issue in the election campaign. Is your word still true 
today? 
  [Kanther] The issue has not been artificially put up, but it 
is simply there. Internal security is a political issue that 
the citizens are interested in, which is why the differing 
approaches to it are, of course, also the subject of an election 
campaign. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The Social Democratic party of 
Germany [SPD] has presented an election campaign motto, and it 
is: Security Instead of Fear. Do you like that motto? 
  [Kanther] It is an empty phrase. The citizens are 
concerned. I do not want them to have fears. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What motto can you come up with? 
  [Kanther] The longer I am in the business of politics the 
less I am interested in coining such slogans. They give the 
people stones instead of bread and simplify difficult problems. 
Permanent concern about internal security, adapting state 
measures to the situation of threat; creativity in observing the 
permanently changing situations of threat -- with such 
statements I can outline the basis of my conviction better than 
with a hackneyed phrase. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] This does not sound very bold 
compared to the reputation you have. When you took office you 
were described as the "Black Sheriff." Have you started to 
change your image? 
  [Kanther] Interior Minister Kanther does not have image 
problems at all, but was never interested in taking any image 
people gave him particularly seriously or even change it. I do 
not care much about such labels. I think that, in politics, one 
can make oneself best understood through success and not through 
announcements. What is important to me is progress in the 
issues I have to deal with. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So let us come to those issues. 
Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein has accused you of being to 
lenient in the negotiations with you coalition partner, the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] -- for example as far as the 
issue of bugging private homes of suspected criminals is 
concerned. 
  [Kanther] The anticrime law includes two dozen important 
points on which this coalition agreed. Since we have treated 
our coalition partner as a partner, we have also achieved the 
State's evidence regulation for organized crime. This was not 
all that easy. What is the point of overthrowing an entire law 
because of individual controversial issues such as the bugging 
of apartments? If the Federal Government wins the election, an 
new coalition agreement can be concluded -- then the bugging of 
apartments will get a new chance. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Members of your Bundestag group have 
criticized that, for the first time, an interior minister is 
concentrating too much on issues of substance and does not 
engage enough in the election campaign. 
  [Kanther] I regard that as a compliment, because the 
election campaign can be understood as empty words. For me, the 
election campaign is something completely different, something 
permanent. Moreover, consumer behavior toward politics and 
politicians is changing. If, as a politician, one fails to be 
aware of it, then one will quickly find oneself standing with 
one's empty words in an empty room or in front of 13 believers. 
I think that the public develops an understanding for whether 
politicians work seriously on an issue and advance it step by 
step -- if necessary, step by step. I would also prefer the 
bugging issue to have been contained in the anticrime law that 
we agreed with the FDP. Yet, had I culminated the controversy, 
the coalition climate would have been damaged and the other two 
dozens points of the anticrime law could not have been adopted 
either. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The assignment Helmut Kohl gave you 
when he called you into his Cabinet was: "Strengthen my right 
wing." It has been said that this wing feels it is not getting 
enough from you.... 
  [Kanther] There is not the slightest reason for that within 
the party. First, everybody was murmuring that the Black 
Sheriff would get the republic under control, starting at the 
right margin -- and six months later this person is simply too 
conciliatory. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So far, your time in office has 
been dominated by the Bad Kleinen disaster. The operation was a 
Waterloo for the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations 
[BKA], which is why, immediately after you took office, you 
issued the slogan that a new spirit must move into the BKA.... 
Has it moved in yet? 
  [Kanther] A new spirit can only partly be decreed, and it is 
not enough that it moves in. One has to assay the origins of 
the mistakes and then undo the mistakes. Coming to terms with 
the circumstances of Bad Kleinen is a tiresome procedure that 
only works on the basis of close cooperation with all parties 
involved. One cannot decree something by pressing a button, but 
one has to convince the people of the right course. This is 
leading to new insights as far as the [special antiterrorist 
task force] GSG-9 is concerned and to new leadership structures 
in the BKA. There is considerable need to understand things, to 
reflect on the necessity to change the work. The idea, 
particularly at the level of the BKA, that one was immune to any 
mistakes, has been quite rightly shattered. In the wake of Bad 
Kleinen, essential basic mistakes were made. It was certainly 
not a leadership question. There was too much routine, in the 
sense that "we can do all that single-handedly." There were, of 
course, also mistakes at the leadership level, particularly 
deficiencies regarding the BKA's behavior regarding 
communication; internally, and toward the public. Information 
was concealed, from man to man, that should have been exchanged. 
Information was passed on wrongly. My predecessor did not sit 
at one desk with those who had the information and he never got 
it. Besides, in such a situation, public relations are not of 
secondary importance that should merely be left to the press 
office, but the police must focus on making the results of 
public-relations work clear to everybody. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What was the reason for the news 
blackout imposed by the BKA? 
  [Kanther] Explanations are not easy. It cannot be compared 
to stress on the site of the action. The man who leaves his 
position during the operation because he receives a garbled 
radio message or comes to a wrong assessment of the situation at 
the moment the shooting starts is faced with different demands 
than the person who sits 500 km further back and is guarding the 
information. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is the BKA currently fully or only 
partly operational? 
  [Kanther] I consider the BKA to be fully operational. In 
principle, the BKA's authority has not been challenged by the 
Bad Kleinen affair. Basic mistakes can happen everywhere, also 
at the level of the Land Offices of Criminal Investigations. 
The connection between the Ministry and the BKA has been filled 
with new people in important positions. One thing is still 
pending -- the formulation of a new leadership structure of the 
BKA, which should rather become something like a board, and must 
facilitate cooperativeness to a greater degree, instead of a 
pyramid-like hierarchical leadership. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] This means a cold-blooded stripping 
of power of current President Zachert, who cannot be transferred 
under the civil service regulations.... 
  [Kanther] No. The president has a large number of 
international, representative external responsibilities based on 
the federal structure of the FRG. The internal effect of the 
leadership can be intensified by strengthening the cooperative 
features. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Something like a directorate at the 
top of the BKA? 
  [Kanther] Not in a formal sense. Let me put it this way: 
The Ministry will have greater influence on, and participate 
more intensively in, a leadership that is more strongly 
characterized by cooperativeness. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Your ministry's influence should 
increase. 
  [Kanther] Correct. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] At the moment, the president is not a 
political public servant. What you said sounds as if you wanted 
to change that. 
  [Kanther] No. This is not what we have in mind. I am 
absolutely unemotional in this connection. There are various 
ways of improving the situation. The basic mistakes of Bad 
Kleinen have nothing to do with the legal status of the 
president. I do not see any need for change in this connection. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You will soon present the final 
report on Bad Kleinen. Will there remain any doubts that Grams 
really shot himself? 
  [Kanther] I have never had the slightest doubt that the 
police could not have "executed" Grams -- as conveyed by some 
media, which is what created the special dimension of the case. 
If this had ever become a real question, then DER SPIEGEL could 
have given the name of its witness. Still, the dilemma was that 
the public's confidence in the police was so shattered by the 
daily changing and obviously wrong information that such a 
grotesque claim could no longer be countered with authority. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] An office that has been shattered, 
an office whose organization is in a process of change, such an 
organization should receive even further tasks from you on the 
basis of the new BKA law: You are intending to give the BKA the 
authority to carry out so-called preliminary investigations, 
that is to say to let the BKA investigate when there is only a 
first suspicion. 
  [Kanther] The so-called preliminary investigations -- the 
authority to investigate even before a concrete suspicion -- 
will not be included in the draft law. This issue contains an 
element of irritation -- not so much toward the FDP but toward 
the laender. By carrying federal thinking to extremes, the 
laender -- all of them -- regard preliminary investigations 
carried out by the BKA as an infringement of their authority 
regarding criminal persecution. I do not exactly regard that as 
a modern approach. Nevertheless, It would be insensible to face 
the Bundesrat deliberately with a set of laws it cannot accept 
and then, finally, to eliminate a passage at the end that was 
known to be unacceptable to the Bundesrat from the very 
beginning. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In your speeches you often talk of 
the authority of the state. Is this authority not being 
questioned by the constant propagation of new and stricter laws 
and by making people believe that such laws (for example the law 
on bugging private homes) would improve things enormously? 
  [Kanther] Of course, the problems of the world would not be 
solved for good afterwards, either. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, your party also contributed to 
the exaggerated hopes that have been pinned on the bugging of 
homes private homes. 
  [Kanther] The debate has started to spiral. This cannot be 
denied. It was like this with the asylum issue, too -- with the 
result that the law, ultimately, included 75 percent of what the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] wanted. Now we no longer have 
30,000 but 10,000 refugees [arriving in Germany each month]. 
That is, at least, something. This result confirms that our 
policy is right. We could have not achieved that without the 
public debate -- which, of course, led to some hot controversy 
and friction. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] There was fire and it keeps flaring 
up. Do you have nothing to do with the generation of the heat? 
  [Kanther] Those who ask such questions owe me the answer to 
how democratic politics should be made in general -- together 
with the people, I hope! I am not generating heat. I am trying 
to keep debates under control with the adequate measures. In 
the asylum debate, I strongly represented the CDU's position for 
many years, which brought me sharp attacks in the Hesse Landtag 
for many years. I have put in my files all letters that were 
imbued with references to morals without ever doubting that the 
policy was correct. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The way in which you conducted the 
asylum debate is, thus, unrelated to the murderous attacks 
against foreigners? 
  [Kanther] No. Only there was no other way to conduct the 
debate -- because the SPD had assumed an unacceptable position 
and could not have been moved otherwise. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So the murderous attacks have been 
the consequence of the SPD's unyieldingness? 
  [Kanther] I have been in this business too long to give you 
such a headline -- particularly after such an important 
constitutional compromise. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Do you not regret anything? 
  [Kanther] I have never conducted a debate against foreigners 
-- but one on the inability of the SPD-Greens-ruled Hesse land 
Government to accommodate asylum-seekers and to deport those who 
had their applications for asylum turned down. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Emotionalizing.... 
  [Kanther] ...is one possible political instrument. Yet one 
has to use it very, very cautiously, otherwise one will share 
the experience of the sorcerer's apprentice. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] And do you really think that you 
acted very cautiously? 
  [Kanther] I am sure. I am always making a point in 
controlling what I say in public, because it cannot be easily 
revoked. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Whenever you speak of the dwindling 
authority of the state, the term degeneration of values will 
inevitably follow. You like to blame the movement of 68 for 
this alleged degeneration of values. Yet, 1968 was a long time 
ago and you had nothing to do with it. So it is easy to put all 
the blame on it.... 
  [Kanther] But I am not doing so.... 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You are talking of 68 when you refer 
to the decline of values, while I attribute it to private 
television. A professor worked out that a 12-year-old child has 
seen an average 12,000 murders on television.... 
  [Kanther] 18,000. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In Hesse, you fought for private 
television for 10 years, and now we are shocked about its 
extreme developments. You are -- in legal terms -- under a 
guarantee obligation, an obligation for doubtful past actions.... 
  [Kanther] Responsibility cannot be denied. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In what way are you doing justice to 
it? 
  [Kanther] I have to change the picture that you have drawn. 
The fact that a carpenter sometimes cuts himself is no evidence 
against the necessity of the saw. Authorizing private radio and 
television stations was a necessary step. Germany cannot be an 
island. Yet, first of all it is the journalists who are 
responsible for the program. Journalists have to be held 
accountable for any representation of violence on public or 
private television. Second, the business community that runs 
commercials on television has to take action. It is 
insufficiently assuming responsibility. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So no more commercials during violent 
programs? 
  [Kanther] If possible, such programs should not be broadcast 
at all. It is first and foremost those who put a program on 
television who have to reflect on the problem. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So no activities by the legislative 
power? 
  [Kanther] I do not see any need to take action, as far as I 
am concerned at the moment. I want the phenomenon to be solved 
by the television people. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us stick to the issue of 
television. The chairman of the Central Council of Jews has 
just endorsed a general ban on election spots for all parties. 
Are you finding it hard to do without a few colorful pictures 
in commercials for the CDU? 
  [Kanther] I think this debate is bizarre. Why should we do 
without television spots? 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Because you have enough other 
possibilities to promote your party and because the profit the 
radicals are making from such commercials is dangerous. 
  [Kanther] What makes you think that? The clips that I have 
seen so far in this connection are all absolutely stupid and 
will hardly cause any damage with people who are in their right 
mind; moreover, there are limits under the Penal Code. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So you think there is no audience for 
such films? 
  [Kanther] Only a very limited one. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Do you not fear that certain extreme 
groups might only become popular with the help of election 
commercials on television? 
  [Kanther] No, this has to be ruled out; that is absolutely 
overestimating this medium. The political parties of the center 
must not knuckle under.

<F P=106> ["Stue." report: "Export Control: Rexrodt for Special </F>
Rules"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 6 March -- After the European Union's 
adoption of an export control regulation for goods than can be 
used both for civilian and military purposes (dual use), special 
German provisions that go beyond the Brussels rules will 
continue to exist. This follows from a letter that FRG 
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany) wrote to the top economic associations. The 
negotiations on a regulation for dual-use goods in Brussels are 
now entering their final stage, Rexrodt wrote. The partners do 
not support the stringent German export control system, he said. 
  Rexrodt announced that Germany's previous additional rules 
have therefore to be changed. This applies, for example, to 
goods that are not on a control list and are only checked 
because of their use in the military sector. Here the reduction 
of the controls to the few countries that have isolated 
themselves in the international community has to be considered. 
Rexrodt wants to examine whether the controls for services and 
the transfer of sensitive knowledge that are not contained in 
the Brussels regulation are only to be valid for a hard core of 
countries and for products to be more precisely defined. As the 
single market continues, one should be increasingly exacting 
regarding the maintenance of additional national rules. 
  The German economy called for the harmonization of the 
export 
rules for dual-use goods without any national exceptions, so 
that the competitive disadvantages resulting from the strict 
German rules are eliminated. There will not be a general change 
of course on real arms, Rexrodt affirmed. However, the Federal 
Government will soon adopt measures that will make the 
authorizing policy clearer and more predictable for 
international cooperation on the level of enterprises so that 
faster decisions can be expected.

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Jach: "Descent of the Climber; Volker </F>
Ruehe Is Falling Out of Favor--No More `Crown Prince' Talk; His 
Courting of the SPD Is Provoking the Chancellor"] 
  [Text] Volker Ruehe feels as though he were in a fairy 
tale--once upon a time there was a prince. He wanted to test 
whether an old saying is true: insolence seldom does any good. 
He recently found the answer. The latest amputation of billions 
from the German military budget brought it to light. The defense 
minister no longer has any allies in the party, parliamentary 
group, and cabinet. 
  "Commander in chief" Helmut Kohl is leaving him hanging and 
is hoping for a pedagogical effect. The Bundeswehr is grumbling 
about a lack of guidance in the chaos of financial straits, 
authorized strength, the question of compulsory military 
service, and an uncertain future mission. 
  But Ruehe is not giving up. His next move to continue his 
ambitious career would be a grand coalition under the leadership 
of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. That is what he 
believes--and this in an election year. 
  His star has fallen rapidly. Just two years ago at 
Christmas time, it seemed to be rising in a big way. At the 1991 
party congress of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] in 
Dresden, Kohl allowed General Secretary Ruehe to take the lead. 
Over a period of several months, Ruehe had elbowed the oldtimers 
of the CDU-east out of the field of vision and now in Dresden he 
presented the finale of the reformer play. Kohl was pleased to 
read the heading in DIE WELT: "The Second Crown Prince Is Volker 
Ruehe." The Union, short on new blood, had another hope in 
addition to Wolfgang Schaeuble 
  Three months later, he rose to the cabinet and became chief 
of the Hardthoehe [Defense Ministry]. He thereby saw himself 
closer to the dream that he had never denied: to become foreign 
minister one day. Any other office appears merely as an 
intermediate stop. 
  The man with the broad shoulders of a former handball player 
felt as strong as an ox. Before the 1992 party congress in 
Duesseldorf, he let it be known that after his election into the 
circle of Kohl's four deputies, of which he was certain, he 
wanted to stir up the musty party presidium. Sole ruler Kohl 
pricked up his ears. Ruehe experienced the first stage of 
disillusionment in Duesseldorf. He was unsuccessful. 
  To this day those who interpret moods argue about whether 
Kohl had lowered his thumb then or whether the unyielding man 
from Hamburg, whose deplorable CDU land association offers no 
local power, had failed on account of his greatest weakness, 
namely his unwillingness to seek allies in the party as well as 
in the parliamentary group, not to mention in the public. "He 
has no need to wonder why he stood alone and lost" in defending 
the defense budget, say Bundestag colleagues. 
  Ruehe turns to defiance: "They need me more than I 
need them." As a matter of fact, no party friend would dispute 
the fact that he is the head of the Union for foreign policy 
with no competition in sight who could be in the cabinet. This 
is indispensable for a profile that Konrad Adenauer's successors 
have long neglected. 
  But sports friend Ruehe likes to take the ball to the wrong 
goal. What he sneeringly perceives to be the escapades of a 
grown-up kid others see as boorishness. His colleague Klaus 
Kinkel in the Foreign Ministry and his FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] complained bitterly that without consulting with anyone 
the defense minister stretched the limits of his office in 
matters concerning NATO's strategy for the East and during his 
trip to East Asia. 
  And Kohl did not find anything funny about it either. It is 
"unwise," according to the word in the chancellorship, to 
display Kinkel in this way, who is loyal to the coalition but is 
not sure of himself in the FDP and in the footsteps of 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 
  This is especially so when the real enemy is being 
systematically protected and courted. At the military science 
conference in Munich at the beginning of February, Ruehe lost 
his ability to speak when SPD chancellor candidate Rudolf 
Scharping knew of "no serious differences with the foreign 
policy of the government." 
  Does this also apply to foreign operations of the 
Bundeswehr, 
possibly with a combat mission? Ruehe, the Union grumbles, 
allowed Scharping simply to talk past the constitutional suits 
of the SPD and its valid party resolutions. 
  There is obviously a method behind the general silence. On 1 
February, Ruehe explained to the defense specialists in the 
Bundestag how and where he would cut from the defense budget the 
1.2 billion imposed by his colleague in the Finance Ministry, 
Theo Waigel, from the CSU [Christian Social Union]. He 
subsequently stated with a wink that he informed the SPD with 
the same degree of detail immediately after the Union. It was 
apparent in both meeting halls that "the same maps hang on the 
walls" and that "the clocks also run the same." 
  The comparison of the clocks had its effect: the 
chancellorship had had enough. In Kohl's eyes, Ruehe's 
nonchalant courting of the election campaign opponent SPD must 
nearly border on treason. Ruehe puts on his poker face and lets 
it be known that Kohl and Waigel had broken their past guarantee 
to him and the defense budget: "That was an operation on a 
living person, almost without anesthesia." Party circles feel 
reminded of father-son novels, in which defiance and anger turn 
into family crises. 
  Old sins are doubly burdensome. Kohl has not forgotten that 
right after taking office Ruehe wanted to shoot down the 
European Fighter-90 and the German-French helicopter projects. 
And not only because it was the first kiss for the SPD. More 
important was the fact that the brash secondary foreign-policy 
man from the Hardthoehe had caused the chancellor unplanned 
vexation with England's Prime Minister John Major and French 
President Francois Mitterrand. 
  There is already a rumor circulating that Kohl will punish 
Ruehe if the coalition survives the Bundestag election. On the 
other hand: Who else could he have for the Hardthoehe? The 
Christian strategists know that the Union cannot afford to have 
both the Foreign and Defense Ministries in the hands of the FDP. 
  Ruehe has little latitude. The desired Foreign 
Ministry plus office of vice chancellor might be possible only 
if the SPD were the strongest force in a grand coalition. But 
Ruehe makes himself "culpable" if during the election campaign 
he speculates on a slump of his own party. After a marriage of 
elephants with reversed proportion of forces, Ruehe must expect 
the tough competition of Florian Gerster, the SPD's candidate 
for the office from Mainz. The Foreign Ministry would go to the 
SPD in any case. 
  And if the CDU has to abdicate? On the bench of the 
opposition, Ruehe would probably find himself set back 12 years: 
vice chairman of the parliamentary group for foreign policy. It 
would be out of the question that he could supersede Wolfgang 
Schaeuble in the chairmanship. This is certainly so for an 
individual fighter from Hamburg. 
  Ruehe is steeling himself with stoic calm, listlessness, and 
gloating sarcasm: "I have time, I can wait. I am taking it all 
calmly." That is supposed to mean that at the age of 51 he sees 
his time as still ahead of him. 
  Well-intentioned party friends are dampening such insolence: 
he should guard dissipating himself. The long-delayed change of 
generations in the CDU, especially under the conditions of being 
in the opposition, will "sweep over quite a few people in the 
middle years." In the end, Ruehe will have had his time and 
wasted it. 
  And his little prince's crown as well, just as in the fairy 
tale.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Excerpt] At the grass-roots level, the coalition between 
the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union 
[CSU] and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] has already 
fallen apart. The supporters of the two government parties have 
about as much in common as two partners in a marriage that 
failed. 
  Most FDP voters think more highly of the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] than the CDU/CSU, more highly of 
Scharping than Kohl, and they want another coalition -- one with 
the SPD rather than the CDU/CSU. 
  This is the result of a survey carried out by the Bielefeld 
Emnid-Institute for DER SPIEGEL. Between 25 January and 16 
February, a total of 2,500 people were interviewed and another 
1,000 between 21 and 23 February, a sample that is 
representative for the 60 million federal citizens who are 
entitled to vote. 
  The objective of the survey was to clarify before the series 
of elections, due to open next Sunday [13 March] in Lower 
Saxony, what the Germans thought of the parties and what the 
parties's chances were eight months before the 16 October 
Bundestag election. 
  The CDU/CSU voters are in a depressive mood. Only 55 percent 
believe that Kohl and the coalition will win the fall election. 
In April 1990, eight months before the last Bundestag election, 
it was 94 percent. 
  At the moment, things look rather gloomy for the CDU/CSU. It 
is supported only by 35 percent of the electorate, less than in 
any Bundestag election since 1953. The other figures: SPD, 39 
percent; FDP and Alliance 90/Greens, 8 percent each; the Party 
of Democratic Socialism [PDS], 4 percent; Republikaner and 
Instead Party, 3 percent each. 
  There are fluctuations, but in the weekly Emnid surveys, the 
SPD has constantly been stronger than the CDU/CSU and the FDP 
and Greens have always been above 5 percent, while the 
Republikaner and the PDS almost always, and the Instead Party 
always remained below 5 percent. 
  The figures for the various parties issued by the institutes 
are more or less identical, something Kohl refuses to believe 
("The differences between the institutes have meanwhile become 
bizarre"). Only those provided by Forsa (Dortmund) are 
significantly different, attributing to the SPD an unrealistic 
43-46 percent. 
  The big parties have become smaller. No longer 91.2 percent 
as in their best days (Bundestag election 1976), but only 74 
percent would opt for one of them at the moment. While in the 
past it was often less than 1 percent, it is now 10 percent that 
intend to vote for other but the established parties, which 
meanwhile also include the Greens. 
  Yet, the parties can be sure of their voters less than ever. 
The share of "convinced supporters" has fallen from 35 to 16 
percent. No longer 73 but only 45 percent know exactly what 
party they will support in the Bundestag election. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by "na": "Demographic Trends Demand More </F>
Adjustments in the Pension Law"] 
  [Text] The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] rejects a 
general provision for all citizens. The draft of the new CDU 
basic program states that it contradicts the basic principle of 
making one's own provisions through contributions and makes the 
individual unreasonably dependent on decisions by the state. 
  The program is to be approved at the Fifth All-German CDU 
Party Congress, which will take place in Hamburg from February 
20 to 23 (HANDELSBLATT of 9 February 1994). 
  The petition commission for the party congress meanwhile has 
discussed the petitions and made its recommendations. In the 
version of the basic program recommended for approval by the 
party congress, it is explicitly pointed out that earned income 
remains the basis for determining contributions. The CDU wants 
to maintain the graduated social security. It combines 
solidarity and subsidiarity. 
  To preserve the functioning capability of the social 
benefits 
systems in the long term and to be able to ensure social 
security of the individual, fundamental revisions must be made. 
Not every risk in life can be safeguarded collectively. The CDU 
goal is not expansion of the social security systems, but rather 
their restructuring. In addition to greater promotion and demand 
of self-responsibility, self-provisions, and self-participation, 
the CDU wants to strengthen the insurance principle. The draft 
states that our social insurance must gradually be freed 
financially of those tasks which are national in nature and must 
be financed with tax money. 
  The CDU supports preserving the several-generations contract 
as the regulative principle of the pension insurance system. To 
secure this, it supports a family-friendly society and 
family-friendly measures, particularly in the tax and social 
insurance law. It wants to balance the extra burdens on parents 
because of child rearing, and recognize more strongly than 
before in the pension law, the time spent in child rearing as a 
pension contribution. 
  In the opinion of the CDU, pension insurance must remain 
contribution-related, and hence performance-related. However, 
the CDU leaves no doubt that, due to demographic developments, 
further adjustments in the pension law will become necessary. 
Pension entitlements already earned will remain secure. The 
economic development and the number of employed will determine 
what contribution the present pension system will provide to the 
next generation for old-age security. Private old-age 
provisions, among them company provisions, are of growing 
importance. The CDU means to promote them. 
  A gradual extension of the working years is also an element 
to deal with the demographic development and the growing life 
expectancy of the population. 
  The CDU also stands for subjecting in principle all 
permanent 
work positions to the social insurance obligation. 
  With regard to statutory health insurance, it is said that 
the growing life expectancy and demographic change, as well as 
still-existing undesirable features, demand further measures for 
limiting costs. For this, the increased capability of the 
insured for self-responsibility must be drawn upon to a greater 
extent. A reorganization of the benefits catalogue will have to 
better differentiate which benefits will continue to be paid by 
the statutory health insurance from a health and social policy 
standpoint, which will have to be borne by the individual, and 
to what extent self-participation will be necessary. 
<H5>  Extending the Working Years </H5>
  At the same time, the CDU wants to create more possibilities 
for a self-responsible shaping of insurance protection, and 
shape the structures of the health system in such a way that all 
participants have a self-interest in a humane, efficient, and 
low-cost health care system. In the opinion of the CDU, 
competition between health insurances and also between benefit 
providers must be strengthened. 
  Within the framework of restructuring the social welfare 
state, the CDU wants to set another milestone in social policy 
with elderly care insurance. The need for care is a risk that 
can happen to anyone, without everyone being in a position to 
make the necessary provision for it. This demands collective 
safeguarding against this risk through a general elderly care 
insurance. The benefits of the elderly care insurance should 
above all promote home care. Supplementary private provisions on 
a voluntary basis are necessary and to be promoted by the state. 
  The CDU advocates that humane working conditions, work 
protection and coparticipation possibilities at the workplace be 
better understood as important preconditions for entrepreneurial 
success. It expects of the wage agreement partners a new 
flexibility in setting working hours. This must take into 
account company requirements as well as improvement in 
reconciling family and work. "We want to make greater 
flexibility possible in determining daily, weekly, yearly, and 
lifetime working hours and shape the transitions between the 
sectors and stages of life more smoothly." The CDU calls on the 
public service sector to carry out its model function in 
offering and shaping flexible working hours. In the CDU's 
opinion, Sundays and holidays must be kept workfree in principle. 
<H5>  Retaining Codetermination in the EU [European Union] </H5>
  The CDU holds the opinion that the side-by-side of civil 
servants and employees in public service has proven itself. It 
considers the permanent civil service indispensable for carrying 
out sovereign tasks. However, the party also advocates making 
the public service law more flexible and performance-oriented. 
  The CDU supports expansion of parental leave time and unpaid 
leave to care for family members. It calls for more qualified 
part-time jobs and more flexible company and wage regulations of 
working hours for women and men. 
  In its new program, the CDU supports codetermination. In its 
opinion, it should be maintained in the European Union. The 
increasing international interlocking of industry, states the 
program draft, demands that in enterprises active Europe-wide, 
border-transcending workers' representations with training and 
consulting rights are established abroad. 
  The party congress was also presented with a petition by the 
party executive committee for growth and employment. Important 
demands of this program (HANDELSBLATT of 18 January 1994) were 
included in the Federal Government's action program for growth 
and employment. The petition commission will present its 
recommendations on the executive committee petition only at the 
CDU party congress.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Heide Simonis, minister-president </F>
of Schleswig-Holstein; place and date not given: "`Gasping Hard 
for Breath'"] 
  [Text] In May 1993, Heide Simonis was the first and 
so far only woman to become the head of a German land after 
predecessor Bjoern Engholm, 54, had relinquished all offices 
because of the Kiel "drawer affair." Simonis, a graduate 
economist, 50, made a name for herself as a fast and sassy 
talker ("every additional year of this Federal Government is an 
investment program in right extremism") as well as a budget 
expert, first in the Bundestag, then--from 1988 to 1993--as 
finance minister of Schleswig-Holstein. As chairman of the Wage 
Agreement Association of German Laender, OeTV [Trade Union for 
Public Services, Transportation, and Traffic] member Simonis ("I 
sit on the money like a brooding hen") was not afraid of 
conflict with the trade unions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Frau Simonis, when you were elected as the 
first woman head of a land government nine months ago, you were 
afraid of a "special role like parsley on the male meat platter" 
of politics. So what are you now, a fresh leafy garnish or a 
satisfying side dish? 
  [Simonis] My male colleagues' fright has meanwhile abated. I 
don't think they consider me a garnish on their platter, nor as 
limp trimmings. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are now among the string of SPD [Social 
Democratic Party] grandchildren. How do you feel on the team of 
your power-conscious male colleagues? 
  [Simonis] Since Grandpa is no longer on earth among the 
grandchildren, it is difficult to say who may rightfully call 
himself a grandson. Brandt also was never asked. For instance, 
it is pretty crazy to claim that Helmut Kohl is the grandson of 
Konrad Adenauer. What would the latter say to that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Too much credit? 
  [Simonis] Perhaps no one of us is truly a Brandt grandchild. 
And strangely enough, we women are never even considered. 
Therefore, we don't even have a chance to stand in front of a 
mirror in the morning and ask: Am I not the fairest 
granddaughter of them all? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That sounds very modest. 
  [Simonis] No, I feel I am the fairest. But we women have to 
grapple more with the question: Is she even capable of that? Men 
are never asked such questions. People only look to see who is 
the nicest. How would it be if we would simply see ourselves as 
autonomous political beings? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Sometimes you are more in the headlines for 
extravagant hats or rings or earrings than for political ideas. 
Isn't that too little? 
  [Simonis] Much too little. It would also be interesting to 
talk about men's shirts, ties, underpants, or socks. But since 
this is evidently not ladylike, I avoid doing it. Despite all 
personal vanity, I find it a pity that my hats cause such a 
sensation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In the election to the SPD executive 
committee, 
you moved into the party leadership with the fourth-best result, 
far ahead of Gerhard Schroeder, for instance. Since then, the 
grass roots have hardly heard anything from you. 
  [Simonis] It is always a mistake to see election results as 
a 
starting signal for upheavals and radical changes. Let's wait 
and see, it is only beginning now. We are still conducting the 
election campaign. That does not necessarily enhance the 
capacity for conceptual thinking. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Social Democrats from the north now make 
headlines only with internal party trench warfare. Since the 
drawer affair with the resignations of Bjoern Engholm and 
Guenther Jansen, the Kiel SPD evidently no longer recognizes any 
friends. 
  [Simonis] There have been rejections, since the affair did 
not shake off those directly or indirectly concerned, like 
raindrops on a plastic raincoat. It irritated me in 1987 how 
quickly the SPD rose from one of the biggest political scandals 
of postwar days like a phoenix from the ashes. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Criticism of you personally is also growing. 
Your party caucus chairman, Gert Boernsen, never misses a chance 
to compromise you publicly. 
  [Simonis] Boernsen first of all does his job and tries to 
preserve the government party caucus majority of one. Since he 
knows that I am tough and can take it, he perhaps exaggerates 
somewhat. I find that quite nice, since I am always being 
accused of reacting too emotionally. So now I note with glee: 
Men do that, too. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Boernsen is not alone. There are several 
snipers on the loose within the SPD. 
  [Simonis] Sometimes I rather have the feeling that there are 
suicides loose among us. At present there is a disastrous urge 
among us not to talk to each other anymore. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How much longer will you let the SPD and the 
Kiel government be damaged by internecine fighting? 
  [Simonis] First of all, I stand for the government, I draw a 
clear line of distinction. The government evidently works 
largely to the people's satisfaction. At least in an opinion 
poll not ordered by us, 65 percent stated they were very 
satisfied or satisfied with the government. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Only--no one identifies the minister-president 
with the SPD. 
  [Simonis] If that is true, we must indeed ask ourselves why 
that is so. Then the SPD would have to do a lot of catch-up work. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For example? 
  [Simonis] We must admit mistakes, also in coping with the 
post-Barschel affair. We are not holier or cleverer than the 
others. I am afraid that no one understands anymore what we are 
doing at present in that investigative committee which is 
costing millions. If outsiders were to read the minutes, they 
would shake their heads and ask if we have nothing better to 
worry about. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] When will you follow the call of many voices 
and also assume the land chairmanship? 
  [Simonis] You mean, as a kind of super-Mommy of the 
frustrated party? That is a joke. The parties were to become 
more transparent through the very separation of offices, and now 
I am to suddenly take everything onto myself? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Because the other officeholders have failed. 
  [Simonis] When a man with a whip goes through the party 
which 
is half-way intact, then all scream: What's with this nonsense 
of running across the parade ground like a sergeant? In Willi 
Piecyk we now have a chairman who is considered too soft, and 
already they all say that he should yell a bit across the parade 
ground. The SPD must make up its mind about what it wants. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you fear that the Barschel affair must be 
rewritten, at least in part? 
  [Simonis] It must not be rewritten. Unless the Federal 
Government actually has information which would justify the 
doubts about suicide. It remains the biggest political affair of 
postwar days which we, thanks to Barschel, have experienced in 
supposedly sleepy, amiable Schleswig-Holstein. And it was a 
mistake of the Social Democrats not to immediately admit openly 
when they learned for the first time about the machinations. 
This lie has burrowed into the SPD soul like a cancerous growth. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Formerly you were the chief negotiator of 
employers in public service. Federal Chancellor Kohl, and after 
him other community and land politicians, have committed 
themselves to a zero wage increase round for the public service 
sector. Rightfully so? 
  [Simonis] No. We will save ourselves to death with an 
absolute zero round when we consider consumption and economic 
upturn. This, my assessment, is meanwhile also supported by the 
scientific economic wise men. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So the OeTV demand for a nominal purchase 
power 
adjustment is justified? 
  [Simonis] A zero-zero round without any social component 
would be unjust and fundamentally wrong, at least for the lower 
income groups where families are left with barely 1,600 German 
marks, especially since others with high incomes and a 
relatively high savings ratio get more, at least through 
interest income. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What could a social differentiation look like? 
  [Simonis] How would it be to make a noticeable distinction 
between the incomes of those down there and those up there and 
to simply add nothing further as of a certain salary level? Or 
to be a bit more generous with employees with children, and in 
turn cut the vacation allowance for higher grades? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But with wage agreements at the expense of the 
higher grades and higher incomes, you will anger a clientele 
which you urgently need in the election. 
  [Simonis] If this clientele does not comprehend that it is 
sawing off the branch on which it sits, then it is its own 
fault. For it must understand that it cannot preserve its 
prosperity at the expense of those earning less. Whoever lies to 
the people now must still tell them the truth afterward. Hence 
it is the task of a large people's party to ultimately reunite 
the now divergent groups. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is particularly hard for the SPD. Oskar 
Lafontaine contributes to the insecurity by freely advocating 
social reductions. 
  [Simonis] We must examine the possibilities for savings at 
all population levels and take a close look where social abuse 
shows up. I know that the tax collector's office is being 
cheated by upper-crust people, and that amounts to more than the 
fraud at social welfare offices. But I also don't think it's 
right that someone gets up at four in the morning to weld cast 
iron plates at the shipyard in rain and snow, while others lie 
at home in bed and do nothing at all. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That was not precisely what Lafontaine had in 
mind when he advocated further social hardships through more 
flexible and longer working hours, for instance. 
  [Simonis] The voters sometimes will still have to gasp for 
air if we want to get the economy going again. For instance, in 
Schleswig-Holstein we will have to tell them that subsidized 
rents for some will rise. We want to give support on a more 
income-dependent basis. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is the SPD even in touch still with the 
worries 
and feelings of people? 
  [Simonis] This criticism does an injustice to Rudolf 
Scharping, for example. It may be true that the SPD chairman 
lacks glamor. But he is not to run as a beauty contestantant; he 
is to make the party electable. So he concentrates on the 
essential program points: fighting unemployment, stimulating the 
economy, and social justice. And he is right on target. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And that makes the SPD capable of a majority? 
  [Simonis] At the moment we must leave some of our favorite 
subjects relatively unattended. To the accusation from the 
rather Green spectrum, that we no longer have any vision, 
unfortunately I can only say: At the moment, the greatest vision 
we can have is to prevent our land from sliding into right 
radicalism. We must create the social basis for that purpose. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] After the September election in Hamburg, you 
scared your party friends with the vision of a Red-Green 
coalition, which could also apply to Bonn. 
  [Simonis] We are always accused of not clearly stating our 
position. So I took an unequivocal position once, and that also 
was not considered right. For this reason I ruefully offered an 
apology. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Now no one dares approach the subject. 
  [Simonis] Because we are so busy trying to win. Whoever at 
present thinks about coalitions, is wasting his energy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The voters would like to know with whom the 
SPD 
intends to govern. 
  [Simonis] Then they should vote accordingly. And then we'll 
see. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Frau Simonis, we thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bonn Guarantees Armament Exports"] </F>
  [Text] The Federal Government is supporting armament 
exports -- to crisis regions as well -- by issuing Hermes 
guarantees. Exports of militarily relevant goods, that are 
subsidized by Bonn, have increased, according to a study by the 
International Economy and Development Organization. They 
tripled in 1993 compared with the previous year, reaching more 
than 2.2 billion German marks [DM]. Thus, Indonesia bought 39 
ships of the former National People's Army. For the 
refurbishing, the Federal Government promises coverage of 
approximately DM699 million. For the purchase of submarines, 
Bonn guarantees another DM665 million. The delivery of MBB 
BO-105 and BK-117 helicopters to Argentina, Botswana, Swaziland, 
the Philippines, and the Czech Republic is also guaranteed by 
the Federal Government. How quickly armament export can become 
a problem is shown by the example of Argentina: Secured by 
Hermes guarantees, Germany supplied submarines to Argentina in 
1977. Argentina later used one of these submarines in the 
Falkland war against Great Britain.

  [Text] Hilden -- There have never been as many crimes in 
Germany as last year. More than 6.7 million crimes were 
registered. Thus, the number of crimes rose by 7.1 percent, or 
almost 450,000, compared with 1992. This was announced 
yesterday by Hermann Lutz, chairman of the police trade union, 
in Hilden, North Rhine-Westphalia. 
  Lutz said that the high rate increases in eastern Germany 
are 
"alarming." In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, 40 percent more 
crimes were registered than the previous year, in Brandenburg 
34.1 percent, in Thuringia 33 percent, in Saxony-Anhalt 23.2 
percent, and in Saxony 11.2 percent. Lutz said that these 
growth rates are partly due to the fact that during the years 
after the integration, not all crimes were registered. 
  The strong increase in crime in western Germany has been 
reduced. While a growth of 9.2 percent was registered in 1992, 
it was only 2.7 percent last year. However, the increase in 
homicide and manslaughter -- 17 percent -- and in economic crime 
-- almost 40 percent -- was above average. 
  Last year, police were not even able to resolve one out of 
two crimes. The level was only 40 percent. However, 90 percent 
of all cases of homicide and manslaughter were solved. Lutz: 
"If we could work everywhere as we are working in the homicide 
squads, we could have all criminal activity under control."

<F P=106> [Report by Claude Lorieux: "Saddam's Emissary in Paris"] </F>
  [Text] The UN resolutions do not prohibit talks, so people 
are talking. Riyad al-Qaysi, director at the Iraqi Foreign 
Ministry, visited the French Foreign Ministry yesterday. He 
already has visited it once before, a few months ago. In 
addition, a Baghdad oil official was the guest of Elf and Total 
last week. 
  France, with its high unemployment, is finding it 
increasingly difficult to live with the trade embargo imposed on 
Iraq since it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The embargo is 
denying our exporters access to a large and creditworthy market 
(18 million inhabitants). France is not the only country 
experiencing these problems. With regard to this issue, which 
Washington is watching closely, Paris wants its policy to be 
"transparent." It expects Saddam Husayn to respect "the 
resolutions and nothing but the resolutions." Speaking on 
Wednesday [2 March] about the "progress" made by Iraq, [French 
Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe indicated that, if it is confirmed 
that Baghdad no longer has any weapons of mass destruction, we 
can authorize it to export its oil. Along with other countries, 
including Great Britain, France does not want the United Nations 
to invent fresh obstacles each time Iraq overcomes one of the 
previous hurdles placed in its path. Many Arab and Western 
diplomats suspect the White House of encouraging this practice. 
An "Iraqi lobby" accompanied -- or encouraged -- France's 
unilateral action of supporting Baghdad throughout the 
Iranian-Iraqi war. This lobby has now "reawakened." Some of 
its members dream of a government daring to "reinstall" them on 
the Iraqi market: Iraq has the Middle East's second largest oil 
reserves. Alain Juppe wants to respect "UN legality." It is 
said that he will insist on this point during the term of the 
French UN Security Council presidency. 
  However, the increasingly tight grip being exerted by the 
United States on the Gulf monarchies and the disappointment of 
our exporters in Saudi Arabia (most recently the "political" 
failure of Airbus in the face of competition from Boeing) will 
only serve to push French -- and European -- leaders to look 
elsewhere, even if they will not condemn the sanctions before 
their reason for being has disappeared.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fisheries: American Retaliation </F>
Against France"] 
  [Text] The French Foreign Ministry feels that the United 
States "would be responsible for escalating tensions" if it 
imposed sanctions against France in reaction to measures in the 
fisheries sector which Washington considers to be protectionist. 
  "Our decisions were made in full accordance with the 
applicable Community regulations," the ministry states. "If the 
United States were to take retaliatory measures against France, 
it would be responsible for escalating tensions at the very time 
we are preparing the Marrakesh conference, which will make it 
possible to sign the GATT agreements and create a world trade 
organization. One might wonder whether that was a good signal 
to send," the ministry added. 
  Yesterday, the United States officially threatened France 
that it would take retaliatory measures against it as a result 
of the severe sanitary controls applied by Paris on cargos of 
American fish. 
  The American National Fisheries Institute estimated that 
losses for American fishermen, whose products have been turned 
back by the French health authorities since 5 February, total 
1.2 million francs per week. 
  Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech accused the 
United States of exporting fish treated with a chemical 
substance used to retain water, which is illegal in France and 
throughout the European Union.

<F P=106> [Report by Marc Deger: "Fish: Storm Warning Averted"] </F>
  [Text] Following various verbal warnings, on Friday [4 
March] the United States threatened France officially with 
commercial retaliation because of the strict health measures 
imposed by Paris on fish imports. Washington is accusing the 
French Government of introducing veiled quotas aimed at allaying 
the anger of Breton fishermen. "False accusations," the Hotel 
Matignon [prime minister's office] retorted, stressing that "if 
the Americans are stepping up the pressure on international 
trade it is to cast doubt on the main achievement of the Uruguay 
Round which their Senate refuses to contemplate: the 
institutionalization of a World Trade Organization." 
  In this affair, the Clinton Administration has acted under 
pressure from the National Fisheries Institute, the shipowners' 
lobby, arguing that Massachusetts fishermen were losing $200,000 
a week because of the restrictions on imports imposed by France. 
And the U.S. Special Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
threatened to introduce trade sanctions on $100 million of 
French exports, especially cheeses, because they are perishable. 
  In Paris, the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] immediately 
issued a warning to Washington, stating that the checks carried 
out by France were "perfectly in line with Community 
regulations." It added that "if the United States took the path 
of retaliatory measures against France, it would be responsible 
for escalating tensions at the very time preparations are under 
way for the Marrakesh conference, which will make it possible to 
sign the GATT agreements and to set up the World Trade 
Organization." 
  According to official French figures, only 27.3 tonnes (out 
of 997) of American fish have been banned since the 
strengthening of border checks purely for public health reasons. 
They were batches "swollen" by chemical additives that retain 
water, which amounts to selling water for the price of fish. 
  Paris and Washington have finally chosen the path of peace. 
Fisheries Minister Jean Puech agreed with Mickey Kantor that a 
team of American experts should examine the French checks. This 
team is expected in Paris today.

  [Text] Paris, March 7 (AFP) -- France is considering 
sending a new battalion of 800 troops to Sarajevo to reinforce 
its 2,300 peacekeepers in the Bosnian capital, military sources 
said here Monday [7 March]. 
  France already has more than 6,000 troops under the United 
Nations flag in former Yugoslavia. 
  The battalion would consist of career soldiers, infantry and 
engineers, but the decision to send them is not yet formal, the 
sources said. 
  The decision would be taken in close coordination with 
Britain. A British Government source said London could also send 
significant reinforcements to Bosnia. 
  The reinforcements would enable the UN to put into force 
Security Council Resolution 900 providing for restoration of 
essential public services in Sarajevo, the sources said. 
  Meanwhile Prime Minister Edouard Balladur held a meeting 
Monday with General Betrand de Lapresle, who will replace 
General Jean Cot as commander of UN forces in mid-March. 
  Cot is being relieved at the request of UN Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali for publicly demanding authority to order 
air strikes against the Serbs.

  [Text] Paris, March 8 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe on Tuesday [8 March] insisted on the need to bring 
the Serbs back into the Bosnian peace process, following talks 
here with visiting Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
  "There will be no stable and durable solution if the Serb 
community is not reinvolved" in the peace process, Juppe said, 
adding that France wanted to help in the move. 
  Silajdzic said he would next visit Moscow and hoped the 
Serbs 
would rejoin the negotiations. "They are not excluded unless 
they exclude themselves," he said. 
  The Bosnian prime minister said he hoped the Russians would 
work for a settlement involving the Serbs. 
  Juppe meanwhile appeared to rule out the idea of French 
reinforcements for UN peacekeepers in Bosnia. "All French 
authorities consider that we cannot go beyond our present 
commitment. We are the first contributors. We have done our 
duty." 
  French military sources said Monday Paris was considering 
strengthening its 2,300 soldiers in Sarajevo with a battalion of 
800 men to help enforce a Security Council resolution that calls 
for restoration of basic services such as water and electricity 
in the Bosnian capital. 
  France has a total of 6,000 peacekeepers in former 
Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Article signed P.S.: "Mr. Leotard Says He Is in Favor of </F>
Creating European Intervention Forces"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Francois Leotard said on Thursday, 
3 March that the Western European Union (WEU), which is expected 
to become the armed wing of the European defense structure, "is 
still having trouble finding its place between the Atlantic 
alliance and the Community." Speaking before the members of the 
European Movement, who were meeting for a working day devoted to 
Europe's foreign and security policy, he said that "it is 
difficult to develop a common European vision in defense 
matters" because "the endorsement of the highest political level 
is missing," he said. 
  The minister feels that the boost can only come from the 
heads of state and government. Consequently, he came down in 
favor of holding a WEU summit which "would symbolically and 
concretely manifest the political vitality of this security 
instrument of the European Union and the European pillar of the 
alliance." It would also provide an occasion to give the WEU "a 
strong sense of legitimacy." 
  Mr. Leotard also proposed pushing further the logic which 
led 
to the creation of the Franco-German Eurocorps (joined by the 
Belgians). He would like to see the establishment of European 
intervention forces to be placed under the command of a European 
multinational and joint services general staff. He also 
expressed his desire to give concrete form to the European 
desire to take defense in hand through a "White Paper on 
Defense in Europe," along the lines of the white paper on 
defense, which has just been submitted in France. 
  Jennone R. Walker, Bill Clinton's adviser on the National 
Security Council, also attended the meeting. Listening 
attentively to the minister's speech, she no doubt appreciated 
that it was accompanied by a warning against any desire to 
create a European defense structure that runs counter to U.S. 
interests. "There is a European dimension and a Euro-American 
dimension to NATO. Nobody would dream of building up a Europe 
that was against the United States," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Erich Inciyan: "Pasqua Sets Up Immigration </F>
Police Force"] 
  [Text] The interior minister is going to set 
up a single police force responsible for overseeing the 80 
million foreigners that enter or leave France every year. It 
will have the job of fighting illegal immigration and the 
"underground" work done by foreigners. 
  For the first time in its history, the French Government is 
setting up a specialized immigration police force. After 
redrafting legislation on the entry and stay of foreigners and 
after modifying the law on ID inspections, the Balladur 
government is thus creating a police force responsible for 
enforcing this restrictive legislation. In terms of the police, 
it thus completes the response provided by the government to the 
illegal immigration issue that it had from the outset ranked 
among its top priorities. 
  Drafted by an Interior Ministry under the stewardship of 
Charles Pasqua, the reorganization will result in the creation 
of a Directorate To Oversee Immigration and Fight Illegal 
Employment (DICILEC) within the National Police. According to 
the draft order sent on to the prime minister, DICILEC will be 
responsible for "organizing and coordinating the action of the 
National Police with respect to the fight against illegal 
immigration and the employment of illegals." It will be headed 
by Prefect Robert Broussard, who previously served as special 
commissioner in the fight against organized crime before being 
entrusted with an antidrug mission. The creation of the new 
directorate should take place--following an examination of 
legislation creating it by various party technical committees, 
followed by the Council of State--in March or even February. 
  The bulk of police supervision of immigration has heretofore 
been the responsibility of the Central Branch of the Air and 
Border Police (PAF). Created in August 1973 and established in 
some 50 departments, the force has so far essentially devoted 
itself to border surveillance at airports and at land and 
maritime borders. In his report to the prime minister, Pasqua 
stated his opinion that the PAF "cannot provide an effective 
response to the new guidelines of government policy which imply 
going beyond mere supervision of crossborder traffic." 
  DICILEC has therefore been entrusted with an "overall 
strategy" of fighting illegal immigration. In addition to 
exercising surveillance over the borders, which will remain one 
of its primary missions, the new directorate is to carry out two 
other aspects of the policy of overseeing the migratory flow: 
the fight against the underground employment of undocumented 
foreigners and the deportation of illegals or undesirable 
persons from France. 
<H5>  "Black Market" Work </H5>
  Feared as the immigration "suction pump," the problem of the 
employment of undocumented foreigners will henceforth be the 
responsibility of DICILEC, which will have to find a modus 
operandi with the labor inspection departments. The problem had 
previously been handled by the police only marginally. Working 
with the Criminal Investigation Police (PJ) and General 
Intelligence (RG), the PAF had indeed succeeded in breaking up a 
few rings bringing in undocumented workers from Asia or Turkey. 
  However, the employment of "black market" workers, whether 
foreign or French, is far from being a priority for the police 
except in the capital, where the 12th section of Parisian 
Intelligence began in the early nineties to specialize in the 
fight against the employment of undocumented foreigners. In the 
rest of France, urban police stations and Gendarmerie squads 
have generally concentrated on missions relating to public 
safety. 
  The government also hopes that the handling of the 
deportation of foreigners, illegals or undesirable elements will 
be improved with DICILEC's creation. Its dissatisfaction is 
mainly based on the drop in the rate of actual deportations, 
which fell from 58 percent in 1987 to 18 percent in 
1993.[.sup]1[/] One solution to the difficulties considered 
by Place Beauvau was the merger of DICILEC with the Directorate 
of Public Freedoms and Legal Affairs (DLPAJ), but the plan was 
abandoned. 
  Modeled after the American immigration office, the merger 
would have posed problems of liberties by bringing together the 
DLPAJ "jurists" responsible for drafting regulations with the 
DICILEC police officers responsible for applying them. The 
Interior Ministry therefore rejected the option, going instead 
for increased coordination between the new police directorate 
and the regulatory departments under the DLPAJ which are 
responsible in the prefectures for individual followup on 
deportation measures. 
  Within DICILEC and in coordination with the DLPAJ, a 
deportation office will oversee the "implementation of material 
means (transportation, escorts, and so on) making it possible to 
effectively carry out administrative and legal deportation 
measures ordered against undocumented foreigners or those 
disturbing law and order," the ministry states. 
<H5>  Schengen Space </H5>
  Concerning the mission traditionally performed by 
PAF--overseeing border traffic--the new directorate must fit 
into a Europe of immigration. The interior minister is therefore 
asking DICILC to step up its control of crossborder traffic, 
"particularly at the future external borders of the Schengen 
space." 
  Originally scheduled in February 1994 but constantly 
postponed, the implementation of the agreements signed in 
Schengen by nine European countries (the Twelve, minus Great 
Britain, Ireland, and Denmark), provides for the free 
circulation of nationals within the space common to the 
territories of their nine countries. As a result, DICILEC police 
officers are to be assigned to the outer borders (the 
Oder-Neisse line, for example) of the Schengen space. The 
Interior Ministry is therefore also entrusting DICILEC with the 
task of intensifying "inspection and training action above the 
(common) border (with signatories of the Schengen) and, in 
sensitive countries, in liaison with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs." 
  If the 6,000 PAF police officers are to be reassigned to the 
new directorate, no increase in personnel is planned in the near 
future (except to staff the teams exercising surveillance over 
the Channel tunnel). Pasqua has personally deplored the 
"unstandardized" presence of the PAF. In the initial period, 
DICILEC will therefore have territorial detachments worthy of 
the name only in departments in which the PAF had established 
its own presence. 
  In addition, the new directorate is expected to suffer from 
a 
lack of personnel necessary for its new missions, particularly 
since migratory pressure has recently increased on the borders 
of countries (Germany, Belgium, and Italy) affected by 
immigration from East bloc countries. According to the most 
recent statistics, nearly half of the nonadmission measures are 
applied at borders with these countries in the Schengen space. 
In the long run, the national arrangement will nevertheless be 
"completed by the implementation of a multiyear plan" consisting 
of setting up specialized departments and units throughout 
France that will perform the duties of administrative and 
criminal investigative police with respect to illegal 
immigration. 
  In the immediate future, the acronym for the new directorate 
therefore risks, particularly in departments where the PAF 
maintained no presence, ending up being but a skeleton 
immigration police force. Is it for the sake of compensation 
that the Interior Ministry notes, with no further ado, that "the 
action of Police and Customs will complement one another?" 
Footnotes 
  1. This drop is largely explained by the decision made in 
1991 to systematically issue deportation orders to all 
undocumented foreigners, not just those stopped by police, but 
also those whose visas have expired.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Louis Validire: "An Old Couple on the Verge </F>
of Divorce"] 
  [Text] While a PCF [French Communist Party] 
congress is not the same thing as a CGT [General Confederation 
of Labor] congress, the relations maintained by the party and 
trade union confederation have always formed a cornerstone of 
the communist movement. Indeed, the unique feature of the 
party's 28th Congress stems from the fact that the communist 
leaders of the CGT do not constitute a united bloc; far from it. 
  Alain Obadia, the confederation's "virtual" No. 2 man (no 
such post exists), has created a bit of a media scandal. By 
releasing the letter which he sent to Georges Marchais at the 
end of December informing him of his intention not to seek a new 
term on the PCF Central Committee, he opportunely reminded him 
that one of the PCF's discreet--if not secret--trump cards is 
also the control it can exercise over the CGT. 
  In a situation marked by the collapse of communism in the 
East Europe and the crumbling of the PCF's election influence in 
France, the CGT remains, despite a drop in membership, the 
largest trade union force in France, a fact that rouses the envy 
of PCF leaders, as well as the astonishment of others. 
  "Some intend to give trade union leaders instructions, even 
when it is a matter of defining the union's guidelines," Obadia 
wrote to his party's secretary general, thus unveiling an open 
secret for noncommunists, but approaching the problem from an 
unusual angle for practitioners of the "usual channels." His 
longstanding (despite his youthful appearance) membership in the 
CGT-communist nomenklatura only lends more weight to his words. 
  Indeed, the Marchais "group," mainly working through Michel 
Warcholak, organizational secretary of the CGT until the last 
congress, currently head of the PCF regions, and still a member 
of the Central Committee, has repeatedly tried to bring the 
trade union confederation into line. The most elaborate, head-on 
attempt took place in October 1992, when the PCF organized a 
national conference on business. Its avowed objective was to 
bring PCF members together to refine party policy. Actually, it 
represented a war machine against the 44th Congress of the CGT, 
judged too "open" by the PCF leadership. 
<H5>  Iconoclasts </H5>
  The failure of the maneuver pointed up the limitations of 
the 
party's doctrinal power over the trade union confederation. 
However, it did not settle the problem of the dual membership of 
leaders. 
  Three CGT officials: Henri Krasucki, Secretary General Louis 
Viannet, and Francois Duteil, a member of the Confederal 
Secretariat and editor of the newspaper LA VIE OUVRIERE, 
recently renamed L'HEBDO to the great chagrin of hard-line 
laborites, are retiring members of the PCF Politburo. The 
presence of the first of the three, a tribute to the history of 
the communist movement, is no more than anecdotal. The other two 
will be nominated again. The symbolic significance of a 
withdrawal of the secretary general of the CGT would be too 
heavy, particularly after Obadia's outburst. As for Francois 
Duteil, "Tonton Jambon"--as he is affectionately called in the 
halls of the CGT by his friends and, ironically enough, his 
foes, for once united--he takes his place good-naturedly in the 
ranks of those nostalgic for a time when everything was black or 
white. Or simpler, at least! 
  At the intermediate level, Jacqueline Leonard, in charge of 
social welfare issues in the confederal office of the CGT and a 
member of the PCF Central Committee--based on the logic of the 
old days when any CGT leader was a member of the PCF 
organs--shares this "straightforward" conception of party-trade 
union relations. 
  On the opposite side, Gerard Alezard, head of the economic 
sector, already suspect in the CGT and the party, 
decided--unlike Obadia--to agree to be represented on the 
Central Committee. In a noteworthy contribution to the PCF 
congress published by L'HUMANITE on 4 January, he wondered 
whether the situation had been given proper consideration by the 
party and posed the following questions in particular: "Can one 
stand still on the notion of `renationalization' without any 
further examination of concrete situations? Is it not urgent to 
put together innovative elements for the public-private report?" 
  These iconoclastic questions got him into hot water at the 
most recent congress of the CGT's Nord departmental section, 
where a welcoming committee mainly made up of members of the 
metal union awaited him. The fact remains that they are of 
capital importance for the future of relations between the party 
and the confederation. The heavyweights of the PTT [Postal and 
Telecommunications Administration] and EDF [French Power 
Company] federations, which enjoy great influence in the party 
as well as the CGT, want to reduce demands to the defense of the 
status-quo, without thinking about the slightest problem with 
respect to the idea of a necessary shift in case of a crisis. 
  It all comes down to "knowing whether the PCF congress will 
infect the CGT a little more," muses Jean-Christophe Le Duigou, 
former secretary general of the CGT's finance federation and, 
like Alain Obadia, a signer of the appeal to the "conclave of 
social transformation." Le Duigou is close to Philippe Herzog, 
who is going to join the economic sector of the CGT, and intends 
to remain a member of the PC's Central Committee because "we 
must fight on the political level and make a critical voice 
heard so as to protect the union." Albeit recognizing that he 
does so without excessive illusions. 
  Whatever the case, it is obvious that if the PCF congress 
falls into lockstep with those, particularly in Paris and 
Seine-Saint-Denis, who condemned the Socialist Party as the 
"main danger and class enemy," it will be difficult to control 
the damage within the CGT, as difficult as the prospect of a 
refusal to consider the left's return to power in medium-range 
terms. The latter would have the effect of strengthening the 
confederation's systematic refusal of any compromise, its most 
natural tendency. 
  Indeed, the shillyshallying on both sides illustrates just 
how complex the relations of an old couple on the brink of a 
divorce are. The hesitations of Jean-Louis Fournie, secretary 
general of the Metallurgy Federation, who will finally be 
represented on the PCF Central Committee after practically being 
a candidate for the Politburo and, in the meantime, having 
avowedly resigned from his seat on the Central Committee, is a 
caricature of an illustration. When even the diehards doubt, the 
skeptics are already banging on the exits.

<F P=106> [Report by Vittorio Testa: "Berlusconi Snubs League"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Florence -- [Northern League Secretary] Bossi 
leveled charges, issued insults, and urged people to boycott the 
candidates of "Farce Italy" [pun on Forza Italia]. And what 
about [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi? What was his reply to 
his ally, from whom he receives nothing but daily derision and 
attacks? Berlusconi restrained himself, forced himself to stay 
calm, and granted Bossi the tolerance of someone in a very 
strong position who looks compassionately on the struggles of 
the weak. 
  "Our political blueprint is so great as to transcend any 
selfishness and pettiness," Berlusconi told his 4,000 Florentine 
fans at the rally in the sports stadium. "I understand the 
difficulties of the parties whose popularity ratings are 
falling, but that is natural, because within the two alignments 
it is the more important parts that are gaining strength. We 
must not alter our stance one iota: The League made a great 
contribution to demolishing the old system, and now it can make 
an equal contribution to building the new one." 
  This, Berlusconi explained, because the League acted as a 
bulldozer. "But when it comes to building, space must be made 
for cement mixers, cranes, and computers." So the League "must 
succeed in flanking whoever is particularly well-suited, those 
who know how to invent and to organize." That is, himself, 
Silvio Berlusconi, who, having claimed the leadership of the 
"pole for freedoms," drowned Bossi -- the Bossi who urged people 
to boycott Forza Italia -- in a torrent of generosity: "We say 
that our allies' candidates are the blood of our blood, the 
flesh of our flesh." Then he issued this warning: "Whoever is 
elected must examine the votes that he has received; and he will 
see in the proportional quota that the decisive votes in his 
election were those of Forza Italia." On this sunny Sunday in 
Turin, Forza Italia was granted 37.4 percent by the guru of the 
Diakron opinion polls, Gianni Pilo -- himself a candidate in 
Treviglio -- against the League's 7.4 percent and the PDS' 
[Democratic Party of the Left] 16 percent. The Italian Popular 
Party [PPI] and the Pact for Italy each received under 4 
percent. Berlusconi discussed the figures mainly in connection 
with Bossi. They suggest a lower house composed as follow: 356 
seats for the pole, 235 for the left-wing forces, and 21 for the 
PPI and the Pact. 
  The word "Wow" appeared intermittently on the two screens 
provided for the pleasure of fans who ecstatically witnessed 
their leader's performance which lasted 1 hour and 45 minutes. 
The performance ended with further promises to lower taxes and 
also to distribute "purchase coupons" for health care, 
education, and pensions. With these "coupons," families will be 
able to decide whether to seek treatment in private clinics or 
public hospitals and whether to send their children to private 
or state schools. 
  Pensions will be provided by means of adequate insurance 
policies: Only those unable to contract them will receive state 
benefits. Berlusconi was particularly tough on the 
underprivileged, but rejected the label of a Robin Hood in 
reverse who takes from the poor to give to the rich, which [PDS 
Secretary] Occhetto stuck on him: "I have changed through 
listening to people's problems," Berlusconi said, "and 
especially to those of the lowest and the weakest. I see that 
within me there is no longer the old Berlusconi." 
  Then he again promised to create "1 million new jobs," and 
this time specified the time scale too: "within the first two 
years of our government, if we govern." This, as long as the 
state grants a "tax truce" to businessmen. Berlusconi spoke 
again about a maximum tax rate of 30 percent, or rather 33 
percent, together with exemptions for the most needy and 
allowances for families with a large number of children. 
"This," he said, "because we believe that it is a natural right 
of the state to take one-third of our income. But we believe 
that to take 50 percent from us is robbery." A 33 percent rate 
"provides a disincentive for tax evasion and an incentive for 
investment." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Alessandra Longo: "Do Not Support Berlusconi's </F>
Men"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Let the Forza Italia candidates fend for 
themselves, let them undertake the election campaign on their 
own, with their own resources, and let them just forget Bossi's 
League working for them. Behind the scene, the relationship 
between Bossi and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is even worse 
than on stage, in front of the spotlights. The latest blow came 
from Bossi. He has written with his own hand, in a handwriting 
bearing signs of rage and haste, a warning memorandum to "all 
League secretaries," which goes more or less like this: Take 
care not to "support" the enemy-ally. They should remember who 
Berlusconi is and what he wanted to do before being 
"neutralized" by the Senator's [Bossi nickname] strategy. 
  The fact that relations between the leaders of the pole of 
freedoms were not good is nothing new, but the fact that, right 
in the middle of an electoral pact, one of the two allies 
instructs "his people" not to cooperate with colleagues from the 
same line-up is, to put it mildly, unusual. 
  And yet, it has happened. On Thursday 3 March, Umberto Bossi 
drafted a handwritten memo on "Chamber of Deputies" leaderhead: 
"To all Northern League Secretaries. It is absolutely forbidden 
to support or to present in any way Forza Italia candidates. 
This is solely an electoral alliance, but we must not forget 
that Forza Italia has been set up in order to place the Northern 
portfolio into the hands of the social security hand-out 
politicians of the south and to recycle the old political class 
of the center already routed by the League. Signed: Umberto 
Bossi." In other words: Leave them to their fate. They are 
former enemies, whom we have isolated. 
  The pen strokes are clear, determined, given the Senator's 
strong aversion to the man who is carrying off votes and the 
limelight. Bossi knows that the opinion polls are sliding for 
him, and on 2 March, at Varese, he had already publicly attacked 
Berlusconi as if he were the enemy to be beaten: "I want to see 
how he will behave when we begin to discuss the question of his 
television stations, he who speaks so much about free trade...." 
On 3 March, he launched the nonpublic offensive: Boycott 
Berlusconi. The fax arrived at the periphery of the Northern 
Empire, at the League's Verona headquarters, where it was 
intercepted by Verona's local LA CRONACA newspaper. How does 
one justify such a gaffe? Difficult... And, indeed, the 
contents of the message were not denied, but wrapped in 
explanations. Bossi's message, it was specified, was 
accompanied by one from Patelli, the League's organizational 
secretary, on the same topic. The Forza Italia candidates 
should not be supported, not for spite, but for perfectly 
technical reasons, relating to the division of electoral costs 
within the pact. 
  Bossi's words are too aggressive to be attributed simply to 
financial concerns. The fact of the matter is that Bossi, 
beyond the warlike statements, is worried. The latest polls are 
showing the National Alliance overtaking the League. The 
Northern League is vacillating. The insults aimed at the 
National Alliance and the "absolute ban" on helping in any way 
the electoral success of Berlusconi's men are the fruit of 
nervousness. 
  Allies are allies and League Chairman Franco Rocchetta, 
still 
in a critical position within the League, is not convinced that 
it is helpful to attack them: "No dirty tricks or blows below 
the belt between us," he exhorted at Mestre, presenting the 
Venetian candidates of the pole of freedoms (Northern League, 
Forza Italia, Center Union, Casini's former DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] members and Pannella's "reformers"). We must 
all be united in the uninominal vote and fight honestly and like 
sportsmen for the proportional seats. The pole of freedoms is 
an alliance and not a malicious marriage, made up of betrayals 
and sell-outs, like the progressive pole." 
  A similar call for a lowering of tension came from Emma 
Bonino, who has landed in the Forza Italia's anti-left pole. 
"It is our duty to live for this country and many are trying to 
make us lose," the "reformers" candidate stated. "We must 
clarify the polemics and overcome the differences...." 
  It is a pity that Bossi has his opinions and that they count 
more than those of the others, given that he is a so-called 
charismatic leader. The latest attack was launched yesterday at 
Florence where the Forza Italia, that is, the ally, became 
"False Italy" [Falsa Italia] or "Italian Weakness" [Sforza 
Italia]. "Our objective," the Senator said, "is to create a 
free trade pole which perhaps could be revolutionary. I say 
perhaps, because I doubt whether Forza Italia would agree with 
an antitrust law which would sweep away [Berlusconi's] 
Fininvest."

  [Text] The Italian General Confederation of Labor [CGIL] 
has come out against Forza Italia, the Northern League, and the 
National Alliance, using a manner of violent language that has 
never been heard in the preelection period. Sandro Roazzi 
reports: 
  [Roazzi] Bruno Trentin has come out against Silvio 
Berlusconi, Gianfranco Fini, and Umberto Bossi. He said that 
they are the leaders of a dangerous right that threatens workers 
and the development of the country. 
  [Begin Trentin recording] No one, not even Ronald Reagan, 
has planned such an attack on the rights of the individual and 
the trades unions--an attack on the constitutional rights 
obtained by the Italian workers over the past 30 years. [end 
recording] 
  [Roazzi] This is why the CGIL will discuss its numerous 
proposals on job-related matters and development only with 
individuals from those groups led by Mario Segni and Fausto 
Bertinotti. He said that Berlusconi's proposals on taxes and 
the social services were only empty slogans, which would either 
lead to an increase in the rate of inflation or to new social 
injustice. 
  The CGIL is asking that workers' salaries, companies, and 
homes have some protection from the tax office. Nevertheless, 
all forms of wealth should be taxed, including shares in the 
newly privatized state industries. However, such taxes should 
be very low and should exclude the small investor.

<F P=106> ["g.batt." interview with Democratic Alliance leader </F>
Ferdinando Adornato in Rome; date not given: "The Italy of 
Competence Must Make Its Voice Heard"] 
  [Text] Rome -- An appeal to "reflect" has been launched -- 
a "reasoned" invitation to be cool and dispense with 
emotionalism in the polling-booths. Drafted by Ferdinando 
Adornato and signed by 14 personalities from the culture and 
business worlds (including Bobbio, Eco, Furio Colombo, Ettore 
Gallo, Benetton, Marzotto, and Sylos Labini), this appeal has 
become the banner of the National Cultural and Professional 
Assembly, promoted by Democratic Alliance [AD] and scheduled to 
take place in Rome on 12 March. The title "Reflect, Italy" 
sounds like an antislogan designed to counter "Forza Italia." 
Is this so? Let us listen to Adornato himself. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this, then, a last appeal to avoid the 
"slumber of reason?" 
  [Adornato] The Italy of competence and work must make its 
voice heard. The meeting which will be held in Umberto Hall 
will feature the three C's symbolizing the reconstruction of the 
country: competence, creativeness, and civilization. The best 
part of Italy must enter the field in order to restore the image 
of a nation which is on its knees but which nevertheless can 
still rely on enormous resources to rise up to its feet again. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Does appealing to those who are "competent" 
mean proposing a technical government, just at a time when an 
attempt is being made to revive politics? 
  [Adornato] We must change the system, the decisionmaking 
mechanisms, otherwise nothing will change. Decisionmaking must 
be closely linked to expertise, following years of calculated 
incompetence on the part of a worn-out and impoverished 
political caste. For example, unless we get managers to run our 
hospitals, we will always have a disastrous health system. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is there any sense in an appeal to 
"creativeness?" Is this not an appeal to Italic vitalism in the 
manner of Pasqualino Settebellezze [movie character]? 
  [Adornato] Not at all. This is an extraordinarily creative 
country. The problem is that people have only used this asset 
to bend the law and serve their own private interests -- to 
adapt, conform, evade taxation, swindle the state. However, we 
must now draw up a list of our resources. There is enormous 
potential for the construction industry, which does not mean 
more concrete, but rather, making towns more habitable. The 
same applies to reviving tourism, which has been destroyed, or 
putting culture to good use and making it profitable. The 
private and the public sectors must work together to create new 
jobs, to launch a Roosevelt-like development and reconstruction 
program, starting from a number of pilot projects. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Is the appeal to civilization intended as a 
bulwark against electoral barbarism? 
  [Adornato] Of course, our country cannot revert to the late 
1940's ideologies. The Cold War is over for everyone. [Forza 
Italia leader] Berlusconi is saying that, if he loses, he will 
leave Italy for good -- an excellent example of political 
incivility. We will not leave -- there is no antinational 
posturing on our part. If we lose, we will stay here as part of 
the opposition. As the British say: Right or wrong, this is my 
country -- this Italy where 96 percent of homes have a TV set, 
where it takes six months to get x-rays on the National Health 
Service, this Italy which has no respect for elderly people and 
children, which is corrupt and cynical, with its head in Beverly 
Hills and its feet in the Third World. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Will an appeal against this egoism epidemic 
be enough? 
  [Adornato] To begin with, in March Italians will be voting 
directly for the government, for the first time ever. For 
[Prime Minister] Ciampi or Berlusconi. This does not seem like 
much, but actually it means a lot.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, Italian Social Movement and </F>
National Alliance leader, by Stefano Caviglia; place and date 
not given: "Now We Will Attack Center" -- first paragraph is 
L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "First, sweep away the center in order to 
defeat the cartel of left-wing forces. The rest will follow." 
Gianfranco Fini said that he has never believed in either 
opinion polls or horoscopes but is going to war in the belief 
that he will return home with a fine booty of votes. The 
National Alliance leader is so confident as to be challenging 
[Northern League leader] Bossi on the latter's own territory: 
"Last Sunday [27 February] I was in Bergamo for a rally. It 
was extremely cold, but there were a lot of people there... The 
League leader will suffer a rude awakening after the elections." 
  [Caviglia] Let us take things in order. Why must the defeat 
of the center precede that of the left? 
  [Fini] Because it will signify the end of any 
misunderstandings. If [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and 
[Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli are still 
able to deceive the Italian people and to grab a handful of 
votes, then we will have a situation of ungovernability, with 
every possible attempt at clumsy pacts and institutional 
governments. Or perhaps a new edition of the center-left which, 
because of the new balance of forces, will be called the 
left-center and have a nonconfessional rather than a Catholic 
leadership. This is the surest way to recycle old faces such as 
[lower house speaker] Napolitano or [Prime Minister] Ciampi, who 
is a man for all seasons. I see that he has now set his sights 
on the Quirinale Palace [president's office]. I think that the 
time has come for him to retire. 
  [Caviglia] So do you also think, as many others do, that the 
next parliament will be more ungovernable than ever? 
  [Fini] No, no, on the contrary. I believe that a 
center-right numerical majority can be achieved. But in order 
for it to become a political majority, it needs to see whether 
the League will accept the points that we consider fundamental, 
such as national identity and solidarity. This was discussed in 
past weeks, but no answer has ever been received. 
  [Caviglia] Such an agreement seems very unlikely at the 
moment. Bossi still attacks you at every opportunity... 
  [Fini] It is the voters who will decide on this, too. I 
expect an adjustment of the balance among the forces immune to 
[Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary ] Occhetto, a 
result that will scale down the League's presumptions by 
reducing its vote. The League formed an alliance with Forza 
Italia partly in order to conceal its electoral decline. But 
the result will be very apparent in the proportional quota. 
  [Caviglia] You surely do not expect to have deputies and 
senators elected in the League's north? 
  [Fini] I certainly do. How many there will be, I cannot tell 
you, but you can be sure that the National Alliance will not be 
a force enjoying electoral support only in the south. This, 
especially since Bossi is still doing his utmost to make his 
rude reawakening even more painful for himself. By attacking us 
and the center-right, he is repelling the very voters who have 
hitherto voted for the League because they had nothing else. 
  [Caviglia] At the moment there is talk about a League prime 
minister, perhaps with the National Alliance in a position of 
external support, or about a minority government. What do you 
think? 
  [Fini] A League prime minister? No, that is impossible for 
several reasons, not least the League's representation solely in 
the north. It is unreasonable to entrust the government to a 
politician who is unknown in two-thirds of Italy. 
  [Caviglia] So whom do you see as prime minister? [Forza 
Italia leader] Berlusconi? 
  [Fini] To name individuals now means not only to ruin their 
prospects, but to set the cart before the horse. This will be 
discussed after the elections, in the light of the results. 
  [Caviglia] In your latest confrontation with Occhetto, 
Berlusconi was virtually the sole topic of conversation... 
  [Fini] Well, Occhetto did indeed always return to that, 
perhaps because he felt uncomfortable talking about substantive 
matters. Berlusconi deserves credit for having ruined the plans 
of the left, which was already savoring victory and which is now 
terrified. This is why he is being diabolized. 
  [Caviglia] Are you as confident about the opinion polls, 
which for weeks have been forecasting a victory by the 
center-right? 
  [Fini] Opinion polls never excite me nor depress me. But it 
is true that I am confident. There is a new awareness on the 
part of the public, and I believe that very few people can still 
believe in the center alignment. It is enough to consider the 
business of Segni's votes. He is not gathering votes because he 
no longer enjoys people's confidence. 
  [Caviglia] The latest front in the conflict is education... 
  [Fini] Yes. It is a good test. The left has started talking 
about church schools. We are in favor of freedom of choice 
between public education and private education. 
  [Caviglia] You will be competing with [Radical] Marco 
Pannella in Rome's constituency 24. How do you view this 
contest? 
  [Fini] I really do not think about it. I will tell you that 
I will spend only two of the 25 days of the election campaign in 
Rome.

<F P=106> [Article by Umberto Brindani, Stefano Brusadelli, and Renzo </F>
Rosati: "How Strong Is the Right?"] 
  [Text] This is a report on an expanding area of the 
political scene: the area represented by Berlusconi, Bossi, and 
Fini. Many things--such as the use of the term "right"--serve to 
divide them, but united they could win the elections. 
  At 1230 hours sharp on Sunday 6 February, Silvio 
Berlusconi--attired in a presidential double-breasted jacket 
with a Forza Italia rosette in the lapel--began to speak from 
the stage of the Palafiera in Rome. He was delivering the 
official preamble of the Forza Italia movement and his speech 
was a "call to arms" in opposition to the front of the Left. At 
the same time, at the Augusteo Theater in Naples, National 
Alliance [AN] leader Gianfranco Fini--with Alessandra Mussolini 
at his side and 2,000 fans [preceding word in English] in the 
audience--was concluding the speech that opened the election 
campaign in the South with an attack on the center and the left. 
Also at 1230 hours, in a room at the Hotel Tre Vecchi in 
Bologna, Umberto Bossi was waking up with sleep-filled eyes. 
Always several hours late even for his appointments with 
history, it was not until around 1700 hours that the Lombard 
warrior would fire his broadsides against the "communists," in a 
triumphant speech at the party convention that opened "the year 
of the Samurai, the year in which the League's enemies will have 
their throats cut from ear to ear." 
  These three snapshots--taken within minutes of each 
other--record a historic moment in Italian politics: the birth 
of the Italian Right. Or rather, of an area that is 
conventionally referred to as the Right: an area that on the 
political map is distinct both from the Center and from the Left 
and that for the first time in Italy will be able to fight a 
leftist coalition on equal terms. In other western countries 
this area is already established and is called variously 
moderate, conservative, Tory, Republican, Giscardian, Reaganism, 
Thatcherite, and so forth. In Italy the first steps are being 
taken today, on the basis of two assumptions: the sharing of 
certain values and interests (ranging from free enterprise to a 
less burdensome tax structure) and the mutual desire to prevent 
an election victory of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
and its allies. 
  The three leaders are certainly as different--in terms of 
language, culture, and social origin--as one can possibly 
imagine. Their respectives staffs [preceding word in English] 
and rank-and-file activists fight each other, and not just 
metaphorically. Their traditions, customs, and myths seem to 
belong to separate worlds. And just as in some science fiction 
novels, these three political areas were until yesterday 
orbiting side by side without coming into contact, as if they 
were three parallel universes. At 1230 hours on Sunday 6 
February, a window was opened among the three galaxies: a window 
through which a torrent of votes could pour on 27 and 28 March. 
The most recent poll taken by the CIRM [Italian Center for 
Market Research] for TMC [expansion not given] gives Forza 
Italia 24 percent, the League 10 percent, and AN 10 percent for 
a total of 44 percent, compared to 34 percent for the 
progressive coalition. The survey conducted by Diakron (which 
works for Berlusconi's party) gives Forza Italia approximately 
30 percent--a virtual absolute majority under the single-member 
system, which rewards a party that has a well-established 
presence in a given area, such as the League in the north and 
the AN in many parts of the center-south. 
  Despite the technical sleight of hand that the leaders are 
using in an effort to gloss over their reciprocal vetoes, the 
extent to which the three pillars of this new right are 
compatible remains to be seen. Three representatives of PANORAMA 
accordingly made an incursion into the three universes, which 
they describe in an unusual way--the only way possible in the 
case of three services that function in parallel. Their aim was 
to discover whether the generals, strategies, and armies of the 
neoconservatives will ultimately be able to get along in a 
single universe. 
<H6>  Style of the Leaders: </H6>
<H5>  Silvio Berlusconi </H5>
  The lights are dimmed, the background music begins, and 
spokesman Antonio Tajani announces that "in a few moments Silvio 
Berlusconi will be here!" When he arrives, the party's anthem 
bursts forth ("Forza Italia, it is time to believe...."), the 
stage lights up, and the leader's first words are: "How could 
anyone not be moved?" Then he seizes the microphone and begins 
to pace back and forth "in the Frank Sinatra manner." Rome, 6 
February: Smiling, attired in a double-breasted jacket with a 
Forza Italia rosette in the lapel and a megascreen that 
multiplies him by sixteen, Berlusconi displays his style in 
public. He does not hold conventional political meetings; the 
scenography is too involved, the alternation between the pacing 
and the pauses at the podium too studied. The great communicator 
knows that the scene has to be changed every 10 or 15 minutes. 
He never indulges in show [previous word in English], however: 
he expounds a program and delivers clear political signals. 
  Berlusconi speaks extemporaneously, after memorizing the 
outline and key points of his speech. He does not gesticulate: 
his hands are anchored to the podium, and when he walks they are 
clutching the microphone. His left hand slips fleetingly into 
his jacket pocket, and during the solemn passages his right hand 
is placed over his heart. Supported even by the Doxa [polling 
agency] ("He is the best equipped to solve the nation's 
problems"), Berlusconi uses the pronoun "we" unabashedly. "We 
know how to revive Italy," he says. "No one can make this 
promise with more credibility and prestige." But he also strives 
for simplicity. "Do not be shy," he says, "we are now singing in 
unison." He looks first one way and then another, without moving 
his shoulders; it is a habit that perhaps comes from too much 
familiarity with the friendly television cameras. 
  He has agreed to face-to-face confrontations but only under 
definite conditions: he says no to noisy audiences and to 
moderators who are mediocre or who are too cunning. Bob Lasagna, 
the public relations consultant with the picturesque last name, 
explains. "What is so shocking about that?" he asks. "In the 
United States, such confrontations are few and are regulated 
down to the smallest detail." 
<H5>  Umberto Bossi </H5>
  "Our concept of freedom does not come from Hegel, but from 
Fichte." But who says this? Rocco Buttiglione, the philosopher 
who has lent his services to politics? No, sir; it is Umberto 
Bossi, speaking from the platform of the convention center in 
Bologna on Sunday 6 February. It is inevitable: every time a 
sprinkling of culture issues from his mouth, the League's people 
do not understand but applaud anyway, and the journalists--who 
even though they too may not understand--smile as they are 
thinking: "Miglio told him that half an hour ago." This is 
because Bossi is that fellow from the Radio Elettra School, the 
bogus student of medicine, and the coarse, vulgar, and ignorant 
head of the coarsest, most vulgar, and most ignorant political 
movement that has ever been seen in Italy. 
  True. Unfortunately, this is also the person who by dint of 
dubious allegations and repeated extravagant posturing is 
attempting--with a fair chance of success--to take over the 
national government, even if in cohabitation with the slick 
postyuppie [preceding word in English] Forza Italia. Bossi also 
pleases his followers because of the fact that he has not 
changed his style since the days when he personally pasted up 
his homemade manifestos. Although the League has gone 
middle-class, its leader has not. He lives in a little house 
that appears to have been furnished with factory rejects from a 
big furniture supermarket. He dresses like an employee at a 
company dinner. He is unable to fasten the bottom button on his 
shirt, because it restricts him. He does not care about the look 
[preceding word in English] but rather--in his own words--"the 
substance of things," so that even though oratory is his strong 
point, he sometimes takes off on improbable mental tangents. He 
then appears to rouse himself from his catalepsy, after which he 
fires a cannonade that excites the crowd. 
  Careless and instinctive, apocalyptic and macho, 
heavy-handed 
and assertive: this is the Bossi the public sees. If he has been 
successful until now, it is because underneath the mask of a ham 
actor there is a genuine politician who is as cold as a computer. 
<H5>  Gianfranco Fini </H5>
  "Fini has been tempered by the solitude of the rejected, of 
the outcast. By dint of finding himself opposed to everyone, he 
has learned how to demand respect. He is at his best in 
difficult confrontations with an adversary, because he strikes 
first and strikes harder." The person depicted thus by Luciano 
Cavalli, an expert on political charisma, is a typical leader of 
the right. Fini is a leader who is tough, cold, accustomed to 
unpopularity, devoid of timidity, and in no way inclined toward 
sentimentality. "He is a Giorgio Almirante," Cavalli adds, "who 
is even more secure in his beliefs, because the MSI [Italian 
Social Movement] no longer has any guilt complexes to expiate." 
Giuliana, Gianfranco Fini's nine-year-old daughter, is the only 
person he will allow to make fun of him. She mimics to 
perfection her father's performance on the speakers' platform: 
the way he points his index finger horizontally toward his face 
and twirls it--the only demagogic variation he will make in a 
speaking style that is otherwise dry, rational, and unemotional. 
Fini speaks in the style of the traditional political meeting, 
but without the progressions and modulations of voice 
characteristic of Almirante or Bossi. He speaks with a distinct 
Bolognese accent, drinks a lot of water, keeps his head and 
shoulders steady, and--as a rule--uses a handwritten outline. He 
has the habit of resuming his speech before the applause has 
ceased, and he likes to fill his speeches with disdainful quips 
at the expense of his adversaries. 
  Communications expert Bruna Pustetto attributes Fini's 
persuasiveness to his degree in teaching. There are other 
secrets, however: Fini always strikes first, never loses his 
calm, and has an extraordinary memory. We also know that he has 
never cried in public, tells jokes, and can imitate all the 
dialects; his rendition of Bossi's Lombard dialect is especially 
successful and amusing. He is 42 years of age, is a practicing 
Catholic (although married to a divorcee), eats dinner alone, is 
a fan of the Bologna and Latium soccer teams, lives in Boville 
at the gates of Rome, and has his wife Daniela select his suits 
for him. 
<H6>  The Platforms: </H6>
<H5>  Forza Italia </H5>
  The slogan--"I promise you a new economic miracle"--had been 
ready for weeks. Rather than a miracle, however, the platform of 
Forza Italia--45 points on 100 pages--is the classic free 
enterprise formula: reduction of taxes and government spending, 
and elimination of the restraints on the labor market. It 
promises "a tax schedule consisting of a single rate that is no 
higher than 30 percent, with progressivity ensured by 
deductions. The poor would be completely exempt from payment of 
the IRPEF [personal income tax]. Taxes would be cut from the 
present 200 to no more than 10. Spending would be reduced, and 
the state would perform only those services not provided by the 
market. Debt would be rescheduled under a system whereby those 
who are able would pay for the services they receive--by their 
choice--from the public or the private sector, contributing in 
either case to social solidarity. Employment would be stimulated 
by removing taxes on hiring, apprenticeships, adapting education 
to the requirements of business, and eliminating--by offering 
legal and flexible forms of employment--what today is illegal 
labor." 
  Nor is the social aspect overlooked: it ranges from a 
proposal to lower taxes for large families to offering women 
part-time work and company-sponsored day care. 
<H5>  The League </H5>
  The platform that Bossi got approved at the party convention 
in Bologna is approximately nine pages long. The last five and a 
half lines of the document are devoted to the plan for 
governing: "The federal congress shall order the federal 
secretary to prepare a plan for governing the country: a plan 
that will take into account the necessity of increasing freedom 
at the institutional level until federalism is achieved, and 
increasing freedom in the economy until a market economy is 
achieved." End of program. Whoever says he votes "in accordance 
with the platform" is well served, for what you have here is a 
nonprogram that meets one very simple requirement: that Bossi be 
given a free hand, in accordance with the usual League system of 
giving a blank check "to the only person who knows how to use 
it." 
  Federalism has become a "should be"; in the document, Bossi 
even allows the word "potential" to slip by him. One thing is 
certain, however: The League regards the coming legislature as a 
constituent assembly. What are the key words in the Lombard 
lexicon? Free enterprise, lower taxes, wage caps, and 
privatization. In short--as Bossi said in Bologna--"let the 
state get out of the way." As for the media, Marco Formentini 
adds, "we will not accept any information monopoly, and we will 
defend Berlusconi against the attack by the RAI [Italian 
Broadcasting Corporation]." 
<H5>  National Alliance </H5>
  "Tax breaks for investments that create jobs," was Fini's 
somewhat generic response on TV when asked where he would begin 
if he headed the government. Perhaps because not even the MSI 
people believe such a scenario is possible, no real scale of 
priorities exists. One has to search the MSI platform, which 
presents a strange mix of pro-efficiency and pro-solidarity 
advocacy. For the economy, the platform recommends 
privatization, provided it does not give an advantage to foreign 
corporate groups. For the League it offers bureaucratic and 
fiscal decentralization through the creation of macroprovinces 
of the Polesine or Cadore type. For Berlusconi it offers a 
promise not to dismantle his TV empire, together with a package 
of measures designed to reassure moderate voters. The platform 
calls for a five-year moratorium on non-EC immigration into 
Italy; abolition of the concept of "small quantities" as applied 
to narcotics; a sterner attitude toward prostitution; a pro-life 
position on abortion; and laws to prohibit genetic engineering 
experiments. 
  In the area of politics, if the coalition of the Right is 
victorious, the MSI will resume its harassment of Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro--who is accused of being a hostage of Achille 
Occhetto--and will reopen the campaign for the direct election 
of the head of state or--at least--of the head of government. 
<H6>  What Each Says About the Other Two: </H6>
<H5>  Forza Italia </H5>
  A CIRM poll conducted for PANORAMA shows that the Forza 
Italia voters--with zero representing the center of the 
political spectrum--place themselves 19.5 points to the right, 
compared to 28.5 for the League and 63 for the MSI. These 
samples, moreover, show that the supporters of Berlusconi's 
party regard the League as being closer to them politically but 
socially inferior, and they place little trust in Bossi. They 
believe they are politically more distant from the MSI, but 
regard Fini as a competent and sincere interlocutor. 
<H5>  The League </H5>
  What about an alliance with Berlusconi? "Like chewing on a 
nettle," says Erminio Boso of Trent. "It would be like a 
confirmed bachelor who gets a proposal from a woman," adds Uber 
Anghinoni of Mantua. "He risks a heart attack. Better to 
continue to live alone." As for an alliance with the MSI, "no" 
in any case. "Never! Never! Never!" Bossi thundered in Bologna. 
"We will never have anything to do with the fascists!" On the 
other hand, "Berlusca"--according to Bossi--"is a Milanese with 
whom it would be easy to reach an agreement." 
<H5>  National Alliance </H5>
  The Fini people have said no: 52 percent of them do not want 
an alliance with Bossi, and not just because he insists on 
calling them fascists. "That fellow," says MSI partisan Teodoro 
Buontempo, "intends to form an institutional government with the 
PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], or even to bring about the 
secession of the north." Relations with Berlusconi are better. 
"The Knight," Fini explains, "has a national image, and within 
an anticommunist coalition he could serve as a bridge between 
north and south." 
<H6>  Anthropology of the Party Members </H6>
<H5>  Silvio Berlusconi's People </H5>
  Homo berlusconianus made his initial appearance in a 
Fininvest uniform: blazer [preceding word in English], gray 
pants, shoes the color of brierwood. The only exemptions are for 
external luxuries: General Luigi Caligaris in tweed and 
sleeveless sweater, and the economist Antonio Martino in the 
vest of a liberal gentleman of the south. And the blue soldiers 
have begun to wear civilian garb, but without making any 
concessions to the slovenliness of League types. 
  The Forza Italia partisan is self-confident; drives a 
medium- 
to high-powered car; and often is self-employed. Thirty percent 
are professionals; 12 percent are owners of small or midsized 
businesses; 10 percent are university instructors; 15 percent 
are merchants or craftsmen; and 4 percent are public employees. 
"We should not ask for anything; we are not paid politicians," 
Stefano Podesta, professor at Bocconi University, proudly 
states. Politics is viewed as a mission, as a mass transposition 
of Berlusconi's "bitter cup." 
  The values of the Forza Italia activists are the family and 
private enterprise. "I view Italy as a nation of respectable 
people," their leader says. Their key words are honesty, 
competence, and optimism. Partyocracy, consociativism, and 
statism are proscribed. Communism is the great enemy. Their 
bible is Praise of Folly by Erasmus of Rotterdam, 
often quoted by Berlusconi, as for example the passage: "The 
most courageous decisions do not derive from reasoning but from 
farsighted, visionary folly." For them, the party represents 
politics in the office, in the living room: just like Berlusconi 
in his Arcore villa. It represents the rediscovery of the 
national anthem, the fatherland, holding hands, the Christmas 
tree. Paolo Garimberti, manager of Tg-2 [TV news], calls it "the 
culture of Beautiful [preceding word in English] and 
Mike Bongiorno." But Gad Lerner, assistant editor of LA STAMPA, 
disagrees. "It represents an individualistic Italy," he says, 
"that is kept on the fringes of the establishment [preceding 
word in English], just outside the protection of political 
patronage, the circles of big business, and the financial 
sanctuaries. It is an Italy that is conservative, hard-working, 
and roguish: an Italy that is intuitive and--above 
all--self-confident." 
<H5>  Umberto Bossi's People </H5>
  It is one o'clock in the morning on Saturday, 5 February, at 
the Holiday Inn hotel, in the faded gray outskirts of Bologna. 
In the dining room, 100 or so happy League partisans--their eyes 
blurred with fataigue--are beginning to leave. A few people are 
still dancing. Gipo Farassino, the Piedmontese leader [preceding 
word in English] and cabaret singer, who is slightly 
intoxicated, attacks his final two numbers: Besame 
mucho and--unexpectedly--Roma nun fa' la stupida 
stasera. Umberto Bossi is sitting in a corner. Is he 
talking politics? Hardly. He is surrounded by half a dozen 
female admirers and is dispensing predatory smiles. Shortly 
thereafter he bids farewell to the assembled guests, and the 
mood turns gloomy. 
  These are the League's people--the same ones who the next 
day 
were hurling catcalls and insults at the mayor of Bologna, who 
dared to speak that dirty word, "solidarity." They are the same 
ones who buy undershorts imprinted with a caricature of Rosy 
Bindi and the gentlemanly caption, "Make me a Lega [League]." 
The same ones who rush to buy the videocassettes of their 
leader's wedding (20,000 lire), the aiguillettes bearing 
Miglio's likeness (5,000 lire), and the Bossi brand of red wine 
(3,500 lire). The same ones who listen enraptured to the new 
League anthem, which is a cross between the Marcia 
trionfale from Aida and the sound track from 
Freccia nera. And then there is the latest model of 
League supporters, who are gathering up everything and packing 
it away, because, they feel they are grownups now and should 
avoid the appearance of being just a bunch of hotheads. These 
are the League people, in their Sunday best, with their 
medium-powered sedans and L'INDIPENDENTE under their arm 
(although they read it somewhat apprehensively ever since Bossi 
said that "at times it reads like the newspaper of the 
fascists"). These are the League people, with the serialized 
encyclopedia in the Alazzone living room, and the wives with 
their cult of the fur coat. 
  Their key words: federalism, free enterprise, 
self-government, "the common people," and "of the people." Their 
hated words: journalists, the government, welfarism, and 
solidarity. The word "solidarity" has in fact been struck from 
the official documents of the Municipality of Milan. 
<H5>  Gianfranco Fini's People </H5>
  Although at the MSI party congress in Rome in late January 
the word "comrade" was never heard and scarcely a dozen Roman 
salutes were given, the political scientist Piero Ignazi, the 
leading Italian expert on the Right, does not believe such a 
miraculous transfiguration has taken place. "In my opinion," he 
insists, "the former ideological position has changed only 
slightly. Convincing evidence of the acceptance of capitalism 
and the free market is lacking. As for the liquidation of 
fascism, I have not yet heard anyone speak the word error,' 
which the PDS has used in reference to communism." 
  The MSI people--the only ones who have been willing to 
define 
themselves as rightists--are suspended between nostalgia for an 
identity that has not been renounced and the temptations of a 
virtuous and attractive modernism. Blue has replaced black as 
the official color; the feminist group "The Bees" has been 
formed; and there are also two new plush mascots, Fiammino and 
Fiammetta, that will even have their own comic books. There are 
fewer gray or blue suits, more slacks, and more sports jackets. 
The impression is one of a machismo that has been 
abandonend--without too many regrets--to the Bossi zealots. The 
party spirit remains strong, however: the nomenklatura on the 
speakers' platform, sections, a central committee, and party 
membership cards, together with a radicalism that is primarily 
of the lower middle class and the middle middle class. 
  According to data gathered by Ignazi, 26 percent of the 
delegates at the MSI party congress were professionals, 18 
percent white-collar workers, and 12 percent teachers. They were 
molded--still according to the survey--by the following authors, 
listed in the order of their importance: Evola, Mussolini, 
Codreanu, Gentile, Spirito, and Nietzsche. Something is 
changing, however: Fini has introduced the economic liberalism 
of Bobbio into the MSI pantheon. And Adolfo Urso, the moving 
spirit of the AN--which was born of a meeting between the MSI 
and moderate elements outside that party--recommends Prezzolini 
and Albert Michel, popularizer of the Rhineland model of a 
corporate market economy. 
<H6>  Where the Leader Commands </H6>
<H5>  Forza Italia </H5>
  If Forza Italia is to change its policy line, elect new 
leaders, and deal with internal dissent, it will perhaps not be 
a party convention or a national executive council that will do 
the job. The creation of the party, the entry into politics, the 
alliances, and the platform: Berlusconi did it all either 
entirely by himself or with a few trusted advisers. The 
Fininvest and Pubitalia organization created the movement. The 
outsiders--the experts--developed the platform: Giuliano Urbani, 
Martino, Caligaris, the constitutional expert Gianfranco 
Ciaurro, the judge Tiziana Parenti, and the attorney Raffaele 
Della Valle. It is a kind of crown council--a club [preceding 
word in English] of patricians who are often installed at the 
highest levels of the state but are not defiled by contact with 
active politics. 
  Berlusconi assembles them araound the dining room table at 
Villa San Martino in Arcore. In Forza Italia, oval tables are de 
rigueur. You will find them in the Milan headquarters on Viale 
Isonzo and in the luxurious headquarters on Via dell'Umilta in 
Rome. And what of the rank-and-file? The clubs [preceding word 
in English] number approximately 7,000, located principally in 
Lombardy, Latium, Campania, and Sicily. After the elections a 
streamlined organization will be retained, modeled after the 
American political committee. For the time being Berlusconi is 
the titular president of Forza Italia, but when the movement has 
a parliamentary group, it will appoint its leadership just as 
the traditional parties do. 
<H5>  The League </H5>
  Bossi's party, amid the proclamations of the various 
movements, is the only one of the three parties to be rigidly 
structured in the Leninist manner. Here are its numbers: 79 
members of Parliament (there were 80, but one was lost along the 
way); 130 mayors; 700 headquarters in the north; 4,000 members 
of municipal councils; 120,000 party members; 3.4 million votes 
in the parliamentary elections of 1992; and one leader. Yes, one 
leader, because Bossi is master in his own house, just like the 
boss of an ironworks. He has absolute control over his 
followers, and is not afraid to banish them or to destroy their 
credibility. And he does not accord special treatment to the 
faithful. Bossi is always reelected by acclamation, and arranged 
for the grandfather of the League--Luigi Rossi, the "pianist" 
who voted as his proxy in the Chamber of Deputies--to be elected 
honorary president, also by acclamation. "Like Caligula with his 
horse," said one League member, rubbing his hands together. The 
decisionmaking process, in short, is quite simple. It operates 
as follows: Bossi thinks it over, listens to a few people, 
selects the policy line, convenes a party congress or a federal 
council, and arranges for a rather generic document to be 
approved--one that will allow him, if necessary, to change his 
mind. The document approved in Bologna orders--in a threatening 
manner--the secretary "to ascertain whether there are any 
independence-minded factions within the League." Translation: 
someone will soon have to leave. 
<H5>  National Alliance </H5>
  In the case of the incautious Alessandra Mussolini, who had 
publicly accused him of the crime of "defascistization," Fini 
undertook--behind closed doors--a bantering but very stern 
historical examination of fascism. Soon thereafter, the 
Granddaughter was tamed. In dealing with the case of Pino 
Rauti--an opponent with a following--he invented a more subtle 
treatment. When the "Black Ingrao" challenged him for the 
leadership of the AN, Fini was completely unruffled; but the 
Rauti supporters were threatened, one by one, with the loss of 
their places on the electoral lists. Having weighed the risk of 
being left alone, even Rauti fell into line. Fini has cracked 
down. His MSI now resembles Craxi's PSI [Italian Socialist 
Party]; its leadership meets only rarely. Whoever objects is 
invited to get out. The various factions have been de facto 
dissolved. "Fini," his spokesman Francesco Storace says, 
"learned his lesson during his first secretaryship, from 1987 to 
1990, when he was forced out precisely by the maneuverings of 
such groups." In making decisions Fini listens to only four 
people--"the summit," as it is called within the party--namely, 
Giuseppe Tatarella, leader of the bloc of deputies; Francesco 
Servello, the coordinator; Mirko Tremaglie, in charge of foreign 
relations; and Altero Matteoli, in charge of organization. One 
also senses the beginnings of a personality cult: there are Fini 
watches, paid cruises with Fini, and books on Fini, one of which 
consists of interviews and another--just published--of letters 
to the party secretary.

of foreign policy for Africa and the Middle East has been 
assessing since this morning the speech by King Hassan II of 
Morocco in which he said that the solution to the dispute 
concerning the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla in North 
Africa cannot wait any longer. 
  Meanwhile Javier Ruperez, the foreign affairs spokesman of 
the conservative Popular Party, today called on the Spanish 
Government to be very firm in its response to the veiled threats 
made by King Hassan II of Morocco yesterday on the Ceuta and 
Melilla dispute. The spokesman for the Spanish conservative 
opposition calls on the government to remind the king of Morocco 
once again of the constitutional terms in which the territorial 
integrity of Spain is understood.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hani Faydi, Palestine Liberation </F>
Organization representative in Spain, by unidentified program 
announcer from the "Spain at Eight" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Hani Faydi is the representative of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization in Spain. Good morning, Mr. 
Faydi. 
  [Faydi] Good morning. 
  [Announcer] First, is there any news about those 
negotiations 
in the UN, with that offer from Great Britain and Norway, who 
could participate in a possible monitoring mission and above all 
a mission protecting the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories? 
  [Faydi] Well, the fact is we are working with them, we are 
holding contacts with all the forces and the countries of the 
Security Council, and we hope to achieve that, because it is the 
only way to be able to sign or to achieve peace. 
  [Announcer] It seems that these nations are prepared to 
participate in a commission of observers, but without weapons. 
To be unarmed, which is what Israel wants. 
  [Faydi] We are asking for armed forces because forces 
without 
weapons would have to protect themselves, not protect us. So we 
need armed UN forces to protect us. 
  [Announcer] How did the Hebron mosque massacre affect you 
here? 
  [Faydi] The truth is that here we have all put our faith in 
peace, we are optimistic and waiting for good news, because many 
of us want to go back home now. With the massacre we lost 
something -- a faith that we held with much hope. And the truth 
is that we are waiting for Israel to make an important 
declaration on withdrawal, on disarming the settlers and on the 
protection of the Palestinian people, in order to breathe life 
into the peace process and begin to achieve that stability in 
the region. 
  [Announcer] But things are getting very difficult because 
the 
settlers have done a series of things, like the Hebron killing 
and a series of other things, that are hard to control, even for 
the Israeli army itself. 
  [Faydi] Well, you know it is a fait accompli, brought about 
by successive Israeli Governments (?in) the occupied territory, 
and I think it is the Israeli Government's problem. Because it 
is the government, it must control them and find a solution to 
this. I think that in order to be able to continue negotiating 
peace, Israel must take important measures for its own security 
and of course for our security. 
  [Announcer] Where exactly does the problem lie? In the 
Israeli extremists, in the Palestinian extremists -- who also 
exist and who are also causing a series of disturbances, seeking 
almost to stop the peace dialogue continuing -- or in both? 
  [Faydi] Well, in reality the problem...[pauses] there are 
several important points that we must resolve. 
  First point: the seriousness of Israel in the negotiations. 
Israel is not taking the peace negotiations seriously. It 
should have withdrawn on 13 December and did not and raises 
difficulties in those negotiations. 
  Second point: the settlements. The settlements have shown 
that 140,000 settlers are rather aggressive and fanatical and 
act violently, as if they were paramilitary groups. 
  Third point: the passivity of the Army. The Army saw the 
actions of the settlers, saw them shooting and killing 
Palestinians, and did not defend them -- tremendous passivity. 
  Fourth point: The left-wing forces in Israel must put 
pressure on the Israeli Government for these problems to be 
resolved. 
  Those are the obstacles that we face. Anyway, the way 
forward depends on Israel. 
  [Announcer] Today there is a meeting in Cairo between Yasir 
'Arafat and Mubarak, the Egyptian president. Do you expect any 
interesting, positive consequences or conclusions for the peace 
process? 
  [Faydi] Mr. Mubarak is indeed the president of Egypt, and 
the 
ones who must provide means or resolve the problems are the 
Israelis. And I think it is good and positive to negotiate with 
our Arab brothers and talk about how the peace process can be 
saved. But it is the Israeli Government that must provide 
explanations and means and concessions. 
  [Announcer] But can Mubarak perhaps act as a mediator with 
the Israelis too? 
  [Faydi] Yes, but I think that mediators are no longer 
needed, 
because we are in constant contact with the Israelis at 
head-of-state level and foreign minister level, and I think that 
after what happened in Hebron, Israel must be aware that it is 
necessary to find a rapid solution in order to be able to 
convince our people (?about) the peace process, in order to be 
able to convince the whole of international public opinion that 
the only solution is negotiation. But not as if nothing had 
happened. There has been a massacre and it is necessary to find 
solutions in order to be able to stabilize the region, the 
situation. 
  [Announcer] Might not everything that is happening now be a 
reflection of the weak position in which 'Arafat apparently 
finds himself within his own organization, within the PLO? He 
is being called into question for the way he acts, for his 
excessive authoritarianism too, in a way? 
  [Faydi] Well, it appears that recently there is talk of 
authoritarianism and all that. I believe that...[pauses] look, 
the PLO is the only national liberation organization to have 
come into existence with a parliament to guarantee democracy and 
rights and self-criticism, critical self-criticism. But we are 
of course away from our occupied land. We have to work every 
day, constantly. We have Palestinian (?organizations) and we all 
participate within the Palestinian institutions in the 
democratic process and within the PLO. So I think that lately 
they are talking about...[pauses] it is necessary to wait until 
we have the state and see how government is going to be carried 
out there. In any case the situation is complicated, not 
because of the situation of the PLO, but because of the 
situation that has come about and the massacre that occurred in 
Hebron. All the solutions must come from Israel, not us.

<F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vuoristo: "Prime Minister Inspired Faith </F>
in the Expansion of the Economy. Aho Promised Vague Tax 
Reductions Even This Year"] 
  [Text] On Friday [4 February] Prime Minister Esko Aho 
(Center Party) and Labor Minister Ilkka Kanerva (Conservative) 
manifested strong faith in the expansion of the economy. Aho 
announced that "the recession may be regarded as having ended," 
and Kanerva stated that the growth in unemployment would stop in 
March or April. 
  The ministers shared the reinforcement of faith at a news 
conference that was organized for the presentation of a 
17-billion-markka supplemental budget. 
  The policy lines contained in the supplemental budget were 
already reported in two news conferences in December. The 
supplementary budget will include mainly investments and 
investment support measures. It is part of a package through 
which the government is attempting to stimulate the national 
economy partially through borrowed money. 
  Iiro Viinanen (Conservative), the minister of finance, 
aroused attention by failing to arrive at the news conference on 
Friday. Viinanen's staff explained the incident as a breakdown 
in communications. 
<H5>  Accelerated Supplementary Budget </H5>
  At the news conference Aho also made a vague promise 
regarding tax reductions. When questioned, he clarified that 
when the May development forecasts arrive it will be possible to 
say whether it is possible to reduce taxes further this year. At 
the beginning of the week Viinanen sharply rejected the notion 
of tax relief this year. 
  The supplementary budget that was presented on Friday was 
drafted after intense negotiations among the ministries a week 
earlier than planned, and it was able to be presented two days 
before the presidential election. 
  Aho denied that the supplementary budget had anything to do 
with the elections. He justified the speedup by the fact that 
the Eduskunta that is assembling next week will thus be able to 
make stimulus decisions more rapidly. 
<H5>  Rise in Costs a Concern </H5>
  By "ending the recession" Aho meant in strict economic terms 
that output began to rise in the fall. In the near future the 
Ministry of Finance will make a forecast in which this year's 
growth will be indicated as at least 2 percent and next year's 
growth as at least 5 percent. Aho was ready to give the 
government credit for the beginning of economic growth. 
  Aho emphasized that unemployment and public sector debt 
would 
cast a shadow over the whole decade. He predicted, however, that 
the beginning of economic growth, the improvement in export 
competitiveness, and the lowering of the interest rate would 
create the prerequisites for taking care of the problems. 
Speeding up investments is important from this standpoint, Aho 
noted. 
  It is also important to speed up investments in order to 
avoid bottlenecks in output that would raise production costs 
and thus cause inflation. Aho set the maintenance of cost 
discipline as one of the main objectives. 
  Talk about the danger of overheating, however, Aho labeled 
as 
"confusion in the opposition." 
<H5>  Tug-of-War Already Over Next Year's Budget </H5>
  Kanerva justified his promise that unemployment would ease 
by 
the fact that the increase in short-term unemployment had ceased 
at the turn of the year and that at this time already 43 percent 
of the terminating unemployment cases end with a permanent job 
in the open labor market. 
  The supplementary budget issued on Friday will create about 
16,000 jobs, according to Kanerva. 
  The government will begin preparation of the budgets for 
1995 
and subsequent years next week. The intent is to agree on the 
final amounts at the beginning of March. 
  Preliminary discussions on the budget have been interpreted 
as a tense atmosphere. Several ministers are known to have 
pressures for making a liberal election budget, while on the 
other hand, Viinanen and his staff want to retain the previously 
agreed-on policy of reducing government expenditures.

<F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vuoristo: "New Road Projects in </F>
Supplementary Budget. The Academy Will Get Money To Pay Top 
Experts Studying Reindustrialization"] 
  [Text] The supplementary budget bill presented by the 
government on Friday [4 February] is intended to speed up public 
investments mainly. For the most part they are transportation 
projects. Employment promotion and research appropriations are 
added. 
  There is only a small portion in this supplementary budget 
for measures to speed up private investments. They are intended 
to accelerate primarily through tax relief and investment 
assistance that have not yet been budgeted. The idea is that the 
relief will be received this year, in particular by the projects 
starting at the beginning of the year. 
  The final amount of the supplementary budget is over 1.7 
billion markkas, but paying for it will require only a little 
over 700 million in new loans. The remainder will be collected 
as additional income from business establishments, among other 
things. The supplementary budget will raise the expenditures 
budgeted for the current year to 195.2 billion markkas and the 
new borrowing requirement to 69 billion markkas. 
<H5>  Almost a Billion for Transportation Routes </H5>
  The government is proposing 455 million markkas for road 
work. With the money, work will begin on a freeway between 
Hameenlinna and Iitala, road work between Jyvaskyla-Etu-Palokka 
and Imatra-Kaukopaa, as well as the Iisalmi bypass, the 
Raippaluoto bridge, and the Miukki interchange in Tornio. 
  In addition road work between Paimio-Turku, Oulu-Ii, 
Benbole-Vanhakartano, and Matinkyla-Helsinki will be speeded up. 
About 20 smaller maintenance sites will be started in various 
parts of the country. 
  Railroad improvements will be speeded up by 400 million 
markkas including the sectors between Helsinki and Turku and 
Helsinki and Seinajoki. Railroad yards will be repaired in 
Niirala, Vainikkala, and Kouvola. The Board of Navigation will 
receive 40 million markkas for repairing the Rauma channel. 
  Construction of the Vaasa courthouse will be speeded up, and 
the Glosholm coast guard station, the Kajaani barracks of the 
border guard, the Mikkeli technical institute, and the Joensuu 
forestry center will receive additional repair money. 
  Since the highway and rail work map did not satisfy the 
Center Party ministers in particular, it was decided to propose 
money also for investments in areas with the worst unemployment. 
  The Labor Ministry will receive 310 million markkas and 
substantially more authority to grant government assistance for 
local government investments that improve the prerequisites for 
industry as well as the state's own employment-creating projects. 
<H5>  Top Researchers for the Academy </H5>
  The government proposes 55 million markkas more as 
assistance 
for renewable energy investments and energy conservation. 
Appropriations this year will be 175 million markkas. Additional 
money is also proposed for establishment costs for the local 
governments' social and health services. 
  The Board of the Finnish Academy proposes an appropriation 
of 
60 million markkas for reindustrialization and research on it. 
The money is intended to be used to hire 30 top researchers and 
their assistants for a period of two years to do research in the 
interests of reindustrialization. 
  The institutions of higher learning will be given money for 
hiring 300 recent graduates as research assistants. 
  It is proposed that 22 million markkas be allocated for 
publicizing the European Union question. Of this amount 10 
million will be distributed to organizations for promoting 
publicity and the remainder to the Foreign Ministry's Europe 
information office.

<F P=106> [Article by Johanna Korhonen and Hannu Sokala: "The End of </F>
the Recession Made the Government Stimulate"] 
  [Text] The nonsocialist government of Esko Aho (Center 
Party) announced on Friday [4 February] that a new period had 
begun in Finland's economy. The government stated that the 
recession had ended and started stimulation through borrowing. 
  A decision was made on starting stimulation back in 
December, 
but last week the government's desire to stimulate became so 
strong that it sent bills involving the first stimulation 
package to the Eduskunta a week earlier than had originally been 
intended. 
  "These measures are extremely urgent," Aho said on Friday 
when presenting the government's proposal for this year's first 
supplementary budget. The objective of the proposal, which is 
part of the stimulation package, is to get companies to invest. 
  In the same breath Aho announced that the recession had 
ended: "The recession may be considered to have ended in the 
last quarter of this year, since the Finnish economy has been 
growing since then." 
  In actual fact the economic crisis may be considered to have 
ended only when unemployment slackens. It can happen only when 
investment starts to rise, i. e., when companies procure new 
machinery and equipment for increasing production. 
  "Through the stimulation package it is desired to create the 
kind of incentives that will cause at least some investments to 
be made earlier, so that they do not pile up at the same time in 
the traditional manner," Raimo Sailas, the budget chief of the 
Ministry of Finance, said. 
  The Central Federation of Industry and Employers predicted 
recently that large investments would not start until 1995-96, 
when the Finnish attitude toward membership in the European 
Union becomes clear. 
<H5>  It Is Useless for Companies To Expect New Measures </H5>
  Raimo Sailas said that he does not believe that companies 
will wait to see if there are new stimulation packages, although 
he admits that "this is a familiar game." According to him "it 
is useless for companies to expect" completely new stimulation 
measures. 
  At present the only large industrial investment is the 
renovation of Outukumpu's plants in Harjavalta. A decision on 
building the Metsa-Botnia pulp plant in Rauma is expected next. 
  The government will encourage companies to invest through a 
special investment credit. This means that companies will be 
permitted to deduct 7 percent of the expenditures for productive 
investment. According to an estimate by the Ministry of Finance 
the credits will cut a 700-800-million-markka hole in the 
government's tax revenues. 
  In addition to the investment credit, the supplementary 
budget presented on Friday contains 1.7 billion markkas worth of 
public-sector investments and procurement speedups. Minister of 
Labor Ilkka Kanerva (Conservative) calculated that public and 
private investments together could now reach a value of 4.6 
billion markkas. 
<H5>  Lobbying Efforts Broke Records </H5>
  In December the government decided to make citizens' buying 
power increase by arranging for an increase of 150 million 
markkas in child allowances and 100 million markkas in health 
insurance benefits. In addition the government canceled its 
earlier decision to tighten up taxation. Taken altogether these 
decisions will increase government borrowing this year by 
approximately 3 billion markkas or about 4 percent. 
  Companies and officials around the country have attempted to 
publicize their own projects to the Ministry of Finance in 
recent weeks. 
  "The flood of letters and lobbying attempts by businesses 
and 
the new provincial associations have broken all records," Raimo 
Sailas said. 
  The government is proposing 455 million markkas for highway 
work and 440 million for the railroads. Accelerating public 
investments will benefit road builders in particular. 
  The government calculates that the stimulus package will 
increase domestic demand this year by 5 billion markkas. 
According to an estimate by the government, the rate of growth 
in total output will speed up from the 1 percent forecast in 
fall to 2 percent by virtue of the package. 
  According to the Ministry of Labor, the package will produce 
16,000 new jobs. In comparison to the December statistics this 
would mean a reduction in unemployment from 21.8 percent to 21.2 
percent. 
<H5>  Good Year End Surprised Government </H5>
  Up to December the government opposed an expansion of 
borrowing, claiming among other things that stimulus would stop 
the drop in interest rates. Interest rates have continued to 
fall, however, even after the government's change in direction. 
  Raimo Sailas from the Ministry of Finance could not give a 
precise answer to why the government decided just now on a large 
stimulus package. 
  "In October and November of last year the notion prevailed 
that development would be much weaker than it apparently turned 
out later. Surprisingly the development was not so bad, and 
consumer demand livened up. The intent of the stimulus is to 
prevent our tailspin from continuing." 
  Sailas admitted that one could discuss the timing of the 
stimulus. "Well, yes, this is not at all a fine-tuning matter, 
but it certainly will not overheat the economy. We shall not see 
how lasting the growth in consumption is until the new tax cards 
come in." 
  The government's economic policy has been criticized on the 
grounds that delaying stimulation has deepened the recession 
more than previously. 
  Sailas explained the late beginning for stimulation by the 
fact that when the recession was at its deepest "one could not 
know at all what is now known. 
  ``If even in the fall of 1992 people had been certain that 
the balance of payments would come into equilibrium so rapidly, 
it would have been possible to start operations that would have 
prevented the recession in domestic markets from deepening. In 
addition to us the so-called markets would have had to be 
assured of this notion. If things had been that way financial 
policy could have been a few degrees looser.'' 
  In Sailas' opinion economists and other citizens have a 
tendency to overestimate the capabilities of fiscal policy, i. 
e., the regulation of government revenues and expenditures. "I 
have tried to emphasize more and more that it is more important 
to attempt to create a stable framework for operations than to 
run after fluctuating forecasts or attempt to fine-tune fiscal 
policy."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Expenditures Have Grown Despite </F>
Savings"] 
  [Text] Esko Aho's government announced an ambitious program 
for restraining the rise in government expenditures right at the 
beginning of its term. The government promised to keep 
government expenditures in real terms on the same level as in 
1991. 
  It did not succeed in keeping its promise. In 1991 
government 
expenditures increased about 15 percent and in 1992 by a further 
16 percent. Last year government outlays including bank support 
were 202 billion markkas or 15 percent greater than the 175 
billion markkas included in the budget proposal. 
  Aho's government has begun to interpret its own objectives 
in 
such a way that it would be sufficient if there were a return to 
the 1991 level in 1995. 
  When the government announced its proposal for this year's 
budget in the fall, the final amount of the bill was 188 billion 
markkas. During Eduskunta deliberations, 5.5 billion markkas in 
expenditures and a deficit of 4 billion markkas were added to 
the bill. Supplementary budgets issued in the course of the year 
will push up the total even more. 
  This year the state is saving more than ever. It will use 
30-35 billion markkas less money than it would have if last 
year's saving decisions had not been made. 
  Despite the savings, the final amount of the budget bill in 
nominal terms is 12 percent larger than the state's final 
accounts for 1991. In real terms, i. e., when the rise in prices 
of public expenditures is taken into account, the government's 
original objective will be exceeded by nearly 10 percent. 
  Last year government expenditures were 202 billion markkas, 
tax revenues 100 billion, and other revenues 35 billion markkas. 
The gap of 67 billion markkas that was generated was filled by 
borrowing. 
  The rate of increase in government debt is stabilizing. This 
year the government's need for borrowing is approximately the 
same as last year. At its greatest the year before last it was 
necessary to borrow 72 billion markkas.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Johanna Korhonen and Hannu Sokala: "Suddenly </F>
Last Fall"] 
  [Text] The small stimulus package announced on Friday [4 
February] by the nonsocialist government of Esko Aho (Center 
Party) raised embarrassing questions. During the whole bleak 
recession, the government has repeated over and over that it 
would not undertake to "stimulate through borrowing." Now the 
government announces that the recession is over and at the same 
time starts to stimulate the economy through borrowing. 
  The government's attitude toward stimulation changed 
suddenly 
last fall. The government justifies its conversion by the 
achievement of equilibrium in the balance of payments or by the 
fact that Finland no longer is incurring debt abroad overall. 
The change in the balance of payments to a surplus, however, was 
not a surprise at all, nor did the government in addition 
promise before last fall to turn its sleigh when the balance of 
payments changed. Iiro Viinanen, the minister of finance 
(Conservative), and Aho rejected stimulation through borrowing 
once and for all as impossible. 
  "There is reason to emphasize that a disciplined fiscal 
policy has not been just a slogan for the government, but rather 
a choice that constitutes one of the central anchors of a 
credible economic policy," Viinanen said when presenting the 
government's 1994 budget proposal last fall. 
  In October Viinanen said that an "unconditional no" must be 
said to support for investment that occurs through additional 
borrowing. Viinanen was absent from the Friday news conference 
at which the government presented the supplementary budget 
implementing the stimulus package. 
  The real reasons for the government's change of direction 
can 
only be guessed. Perhaps the government has come to the position 
that record unemployment will not improve of its own accord. 
Perhaps the hawks are getting the upper hand over the doves in 
the government. Perhaps the Conservatives and the Center Party 
have begun to fear for their support before the spring Eduskunta 
elections. 
  One would like to think that announcing the stimulus 
projects 
two days before the second round of the presidential elections 
was pure chance, although Elisabeth Rehn (Swedish Peoples 
Party), the minister of defense, stubbornly defended the 
government policy in her campaign. The government would not have 
the gall to play games with so serious matters, would it? 
  The Finance Ministry opposed stimulation up to last fall, 
because it believed that stimulation would deepen the 
government's long-term indebtedness and stop the reduction in 
interest rates. The interest rate fear seems to have been 
unnecessary; interest rates continued to fall after the 
government announced the beginning of stimulation through 
borrowing. 
  The government may have delayed the beginning of stimulation 
also to keep the labor market organizations and the Eduskunta 
under control last fall. Planned gloominess promoted arriving at 
income solutions that suited the government and budget 
deliberations in the manner desired by the government. 
  Finnish economic policy has traditionally reinforced 
business 
cycles: Through government measures declines have been deepened 
and booms heated up. This time too the beginning of stimulation 
has gone awry from the standpoint of breaking up the recession. 
When presenting the stimulus package on Friday, Aho himself said 
that the recession had ended already in the last quarter of last 
year.

  [Text] The number of local government employees receiving 
unemployment benefits rose 55 percent during the year. The 
unemployment fund of the local government employees' trade union 
KTV paid unemployment benefits to over 77,000 of its members. 
The union has about 230,000 members in all. 
  The KTV fund paid about 1.5 billion markkas in benefits last 
year. Sixty percent of the recipients were completely 
unemployed. Benefits were paid for 139 days on the average. 
Women made up 72 percent of the benefit recipients. 
  Nearly 3,000 local government employees lost benefits tied 
to 
earnings because their unemployment lasted over 500 days.

<F P=106> [Article by Antti Manninen: "Helsinki Intends To Discharge </F>
Hundreds of Its College-Educated Employees. City Government Will 
Decide How the Savings Share of Akava Employees Will Be 
Collected"] 
  [Text] Deputy City Manager Antti Viinikka intends to 
propose to the Helsinki City Government that the city start 
discharging and furloughing its college-educated employees. 
  Viinikka estimated that the number to be discharged would 
rise to 400-600 persons if the savings share of college-educated 
persons belonging to Akava [trade union for college-educated 
employees] is collected completely through layoffs. 
  If Viinikka's proposal goes through, the city's various 
offices will be given the right to discharge and furlough as 
many college-educated employees as are needed to save 2.7 
percent on their wage and salary expenditures, just as for the 
other personnel groups. In addition the offices have the 
possibility of saving people by reducing the offices' general 
2-percent savings obligation. From this will come a total of 
400-600 persons. 
  Viinikka, who is responsible for the city's personnel 
matters, said that the employer no longer has any alternative. 
"The other organizations have demanded that those who have 
remained outside be treated at least in the same manner as those 
covered by the contract." 
  There is a total of about 37,000 persons serving the city of 
Helsinki. About a fourth of them belong to the Akava trade 
union. The organizations representing all of the other employee 
groups have approved the local collective bargaining agreement, 
which is called the coping agreement. It will be signed on 
Friday [4 February]. According to the agreement only 40 percent 
of the vacation pay will be paid this year, which corresponds to 
a saving of 2.7 percent on wage expenditures.

issue, said that he has positive expectations for the talks and 
does not expect to face any problems. Speaking upon his arrival 
in Cyprus this afternoon, Mr. Lamb added that Washington 
believes the proximity talks on the confidence-building measures

and serious questions that, however, are addressed 
constructively and with prudence. 
  The U.S. coordinator also said that he comes to Cyprus to be 
informed of the precise positions of the two sides, and that the 
United States believes this is a very critical time for the 
Cyprus issue and the future of Cyprus. Mr. Lamb added: What is 
going on now could open opportunities for the solution of 
problems that have been causing hardship for the island for a 
long time. Mr. Lamb further noted that the United States is 
prepared to offer any help it can. 
  Asked about his recent visit to Moscow, Mr. Lamb said that a 
series of problems, including the Cyprus issue, were discussed 
during his visit.

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali noted that 
the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus should be able to 
lead their proximity talks on the confidence-building measures 
to a successful conclusion within the next few weeks. In a 
report to the UN Security Council, a summary of which REUTER 
news agency reported this morning, Butrus-Ghali also notes that 
the proximity talks can not drag on for long. An agreement in 
Cyprus, he adds, would represent the most significant 
development on the island in two decades and would create a new 
and more positive prospect for the future. However, the 
secretary general warns, the consequences of a failure would 
certainly be very negative. In his report, Butrus-Ghali 
describes as positive the fact that President Glavkos Kliridhis 
and [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas accepted the package 
of confidence-building measures in principle, and that they have 
begun intensive negotiations in Nicosia with his representatives 
on the basis of agreed arrangements to work out ways to 
implement the package. Finally, in his report, Butrus-Ghali 
notes that with the show of the necessary goodwill, leaders of 
the two communities will be able to bring the proximity talks to 
a positive conclusion within a few weeks.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Serious Revelations"] </F>
  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis' revelations -- that 
third parties are trying, in every way, to prevent 
implementation of the decision by Cyprus and Greece for a common 
strategy and one unified defense space -- are particularly 
serious. Because once again, this proves foreign intervention 
and conspiracy against Cyprus during a new decisive phase of the 
Cyprus issue. The president did not reveal who the third 
parties trying to prevent implementation of the new defense 
doctrine are. The doctrine actually means the accession of 
Cyprus to Greece's unified defense space. 
  There was no doubt of the fact that foreigners would 
conspire 
against the new defense doctrine. In any case, the reaction of 
the British and Americans on the issue of the National Guard's 
arms program and the representations made, at times, toward 
France and other countries that sell arms to Cyprus, are known. 
  However, what is nice is that both the Cypriot and the Greek 
Governments reject the interventions by the third parties on the 
new defense doctrine and methodically proceed with its 
implementation. Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos 
Arsenis' visit to Nicosia next week is indicative of the 
decisions by the two governments not to take seriously the 
intervention of the British and Americans, and not to back down 
on the issue of the unified defense space. The Greek defense 
minister along with the Cypriot Government and military 
leadership will study ways for quicker implementation of what 
has been decided in Athens between President Kliridhis and Greek 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. 
  In the meantime, people are outraged by the foreign 
interventions that have to do not only with the political but 
also with the military aspect of the Cyprus issue, because the 
British and Americans, and whoever else, are not bothered and 
concerned with the presence of 35,000 Turkish troops and 70,000 
settlers in Cyprus. On the contrary, they are bothered because 
it was decided that Cyprus' defenses should be put on a new 
basis so that the island will not be under constant threat from 
a new Turkish offensive. This "concern" expressed by the 
foreigners raises many questions that should teach us a lot. 
  Because, the foreigners want an undefended and weak Cyprus 
that will always be under foreign influence. It is a blessing 
that the two governments rejected the foreigners' efforts and, 
systematically and quietly, have proceeded with the 
implementation of the unified defense goal.

  [Excerpts] In a statement to Europe No. 1 Radio today, 
European Commission President Jacques Delors unleashed a harsh 
attack against our country and stressed that Greece should be 
careful of the measures it has taken against the small republic 
of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], 
as he called Skopje, and added that these measures are not 
acceptable. [passage omitted] 
  Responding to Delors statement, government spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos said: Mr. Delors has made a very general 
statement on the European family and I think he referred to the 
concept of European solidarity, to which Greece also attaches 
very great importance. Mr. Delors has his views on the measures 
the Greek Government took on 16 February and he outlined these 
as president of the Commission in the letter he sent to the 
prime minister; the replies and procedures are well known. Mr. 
Venizelos concluded: Nothing special emerged in today's radio 
statement by Mr. Delors.

  [Excerpts] "Our national independence is not threatened by 
any propaganda, even though it may falsify history, as much as 
it is threatened by NATO's presence and actions in the Balkans." 
This was stressed yesterday by KKE [Greek Communist Party] 
General Secretary Aleka Papariga following her meeting with 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. 
  During the meeting with the prime minister, Papariga 
outlined 
the KKE views on the Balkan crisis, of which Greece has become a 
part due to its dispute with FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia]. She also expressed the party's opposition to the 
nationalist rallies, which "introduce the poison of nationalism 
and chauvinism to the Greek people," especially to the younger 
generation that is urged to participate. 
  Finally, the KKE general secretary stressed the need for the 
formation of a front of various peoples against the so-called 
foreign protectors to defend against their intervention and deal 
with any differences among these peoples. 
  Following her meeting with the prime minister, Papariga 
said: 
"As you know, the meeting took place following our own 
initiative to be briefed on developments in the Balkans and to 
officially express our views. 
  ``I want to stress the issues I raised with the prime 
minister on behalf of the KKE. 
  ``We consider that our country and our national independence 
is not threatened by any propaganda, even though it may falsify 
history, as much as it is threatened by NATO's presence and 
actions in the Balkans. 
  ``The new element that concerns us is the downing of the 
planes. NATO is now carrying out relatively autonomous 
actions.'' [passage omitted] 
  "Therefore, we are concerned about NATO and the situation in 
the area and believe that it is a danger and a continuous threat 
to Greece. Greece is already part of the crisis in the Balkans, 
and the government's countermeasures have further involved our 
country." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The approaching Nevruz [Kurdish new year] and local 
elections are aggravating the already existing tension. PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] leader Abdullah Ocalan ordered his 
organization to turn the region into a hell on the eve of the 
elections. 
  The Turkish Armed Forces are sending an additional 50,000 
troops in view of the approaching Nevruz and local elections. 
  [Begin Fatih Yilmaz recording] According to available 
information, Ocalan ordered high-ranking PKK leaders to escalate 
terrorist activities in southeastern Anatolia before 21 March. 
Ocalan also called on the organizations' militants to organize 
Nevruz celebrations on 21 March in the form of a popular 
uprising. Ocalan, the leader of the separatist terror 
organization, had made a similar call before the Nevruz 
celebrations in 1992. That time, 103 people died in the ensuing 
incidents. 
  The PKK has also called for the boycott of the local 
elections to be held a week after the Nevruz celebrations. 
  A series of new security measures are being taken in the 
region to ensure that Nevruz and the local elections are held 
without any incident. In this framework, 50,000 additional 
troops are being sent to southeastern Anatolia. With this, the 
number of troops deployed in the region will reach 150,000. To 
start with, units from the Bolu and Kayseri commando schools 
have already been sent there. The 65th Infantry Division 
stationed in Marmara region also left for the region. The A and 
B teams of the Special Forces Command will also be sent to the 
region to ensure border and road security. There is also a plan 
to send a F-16 squadron to Diyarbakir. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Fikret Bila: "Suggestions for Ciller from </F>
Demirel"] 
  [Excerpt] Ankara--[Passage omitted] Demirel listed as 
follows for MILLIYET the decisions he considers necessary for 
the economy to overcome its stagnation: 
  1) The state must definitely get out of setting prices. 2) 
The KIT's [State Economic Enterprises] must be sold rapidly. 3) 
The marketplace must abandon interest formation and must not 
insist on an interest ceiling below inflation. 4) The foreign 
exchange rate must be left entirely to the marketplace, and the 
state definitely must not intervene. 5) The taxation and export 
incentive systems must be revised. 6) State indebtedness to the 
investing private sector must be repaid immediately. 
  Demirel stressed that although these measures are not as 
radical as the 24 January decisions they must absolutely be 
adopted if the free market economy is to take hold and healthy 
balances to be formed. 
<H5>  Fear of Intervention </H5>
  Demirel stressed that Turkey seems to want a free market 
economy, but actually does not and fears the free economy. For 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, he had the message: "Don't 
intervene in the economy," and made the following evaluation: 
  "The most important problem of the economy in Turkey is the 
failure to make the transition to a free market economy in the 
full sense. Turkey is afraid of the free market. The state is 
intervening in the economy. Free market rules do not work when 
there is constant fear of state intervention. It is necessary to 
take the measures I listed to eliminate this fear." 
  Demirel pointed out that the 24 January decisions met two of 
the three goals of the period in which they originated and said: 
"The 24 January decisions had three goals. One was to eliminate 
shortages, another was to step up the economic process, and 
another was to ensure the transition to a free market economy. 
The decisions eliminated the shortages at that time and stepped 
up the economic process, but the transition to the free market 
economy, the most important goal, has not been fully 
accomplished. This process is continuing but has not been 
completed. From this standpoint, the 24 January decisions failed 
to achieve their third goal. To achieve it, the decisions I 
mentioned must be taken and the formation of economic balances 
must be left entirely to the marketplace. 
  ``Turkey's economy is still a command economy. As long as we 
have a command economy, the necessity to overcome bottlenecks 
and the occurrence of sudden imbalances, just as in the past, 
will be unavoidable. Turkey must now make the decision to 
abandon the command economy and must not be afraid of it.'' 
  Demirel pointed out that the dinner he hosted at Cankaya 
yesterday for bank administrators had nothing to do with recent 
economic events, that for a long time he has been having dinners 
periodically for groups such as professional organizations and 
trade guilds, and that this one had been planned far in advance 
of the recent foreign exchange event. Demirel said, "My party 
for bank administrators was not something that was done after 
the recent foreign exchange event. It was a routine arrangement 
along with other organizations for which the date had been set 
far in advance."

<F P=106> [Article by Yalcin Dogan from the "Diary" column: "Fifty </F>
Billion From King Fahd for Prosperity!"] 
  [Text] King Fahd and Necmettin Erbakan are so close that 
nothing can come between them. Unless, of course, the money that 
is now ready to flow from "every sort of amenity" that has been 
made available could be called "coming between" them. What a 
windfall -- "50 billion lira coming between them" for going on 
the hajj before the first step is even taken! If they can double 
the hajj quota, Saudi Arabia's contribution to the Prosperity 
Party [RP] will then rise to "100 billion lira." 
  Saudi Arabia was "very generous to the Prosperity Party" 
before the local elections in Turkey. The Saudis think of their 
"Turkish brother in religion" first and foremost. To think of 
their Turkish brothers in religion means to think first of the 
Prosperity Party. Indeed, when we are heading into regular 
elections, at a time when all the world needs money, why should 
Saudi King Fahd not think of his "religious brother" Necmettin 
Erbakan, his religion, and his entire party, Prosperity? 
  CUMHURIYET published a report yesterday, a report about 
"hajj 
memo given to Saudis." I know there are other dimensions to it 
because I have been following it closely for several days. Those 
dimensions give certain clues to the "RP's sources of income," a 
topic often discussed and wondered about. 
  It is necessary to follow these clues closely to avoid 
getting tangled when the threads all come together to make a 
ball! 
  The incident is actually also an international scandal. 
Saudi 
Arabia gives Turkey a quota each year for the hajj, as it does 
every Muslim country. Right now this quota is 60,000 a year. 
There is an official protocol between the two countries that 
governs this. 
<H5>  "Special" Quota for RP! </H5>
  For the past 3 years, 39,000 of the 60,000 have gone on the 
hajj through Department of Religious Affairs channels, and the 
remaining 21,000 have been sponsored by private business. 
  Each hajj candidate pays $1,700 for cost of travel, food, 
and 
accommodations. If full accommodations for two weeks, the 
difference if it is a five-star hotel, and communications costs 
are added to this, it can reach $4,920 per pilgrim. Moreover, 
money must be allocated for sacrifice and other expenses, which 
may vary between $500 and $1,000. All of this money for expenses 
and visas is handled "through official channels." 
  Now comes the "Prosperity Party-Saudi Arabia connection" 
right in the middle of all this. In addition to the 
60,000-pilgrim quota that Saudi Arabia assigns to Turkey, "an 
additional quota of 5,000 people is being assigned to the 
Prosperity Party" -- as opposed to the protocol between the 
countries. 
  Although it was officially reported earlier that Turkey 
wanted to increase its pilgrim quota, Riyadh denied this 
request. Nevertheless, a 5,000-person quota is granted to 
Prosperity... plus a promise "to raise this figure to 10,000 
later." 
  What does this mean? It means "the significance of the 
5,000-person quota is 50 billion lira, and the significance of 
the 10,000-person quota is 100 billion lira." 
  According to Department of Religious Affairs figures, a 
source of 50 billion lira has been created for the Prosperity 
Party for the visa and other expenses of 5,000 people. That is, 
Saudi Arabia is saving the RP from the trouble of finding money 
for elections! 
<H5>  Note to Arabia </H5>
  Minister of State Necmettin Cevheri is looking into the 
matter. He held meeting after meeting during the past several 
days at the Department of Religious Affairs. Foreign Minister 
Hikmet Cetin entered the picture later. 
  And two days ago, Riyadh's charge d'affaires in Ankara was 
called to the Foreign Ministry and given a note. It stresses 
that the "matter is governed by protocol between the two 
countries, and contrary behavior violates the diplomatic rules." 
It adds that the quota assigned the RP is "invalid." 
  But it is not this simple or easily dismissed. One country 
is 
clearly "indirectly increasing the resources" of a political 
party of another country! While most parties are certainly 
struggling for "money" during elections, the RP is solving this 
problem through Saudi Arabia! 
  There is no intrinsic difference between ILKSAN [Primary 
School Teachers Health and Social Assistance Fund], ISKI 
[Istanbul Water and Sewer Authority], or the hajj quota. There 
was corruption in the first two, and the truth came out only 
later. Now there is awareness of the matter beforehand and it is 
being prevented. The ILKSAN and ISKI incidents are, in the term 
so beloved by Erbakan and the Prosperity Party, "national" in 
nature. This, however, in other terms they are equally fond of, 
is "antinational, foreign." 
  If the RP were to come to power, it is now clear "how it 
would protect our national and moral values, how and with whom 
it would establish the order of justice." "National view" is now 
clearer! Prosperity's mask has slipped.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F>
by Franz-Olivier Giesbert in Brussels; date not given -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Mr. Delors, you 
have just been to Hungary, and we now have to think about an 
enlargement with the countries of former East Europe, in 
particular Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. They are 
all in a great hurry and want to go faster. But we do not. 
  [Delors] No, because the economic conditions must be 
fulfilled. Otherwise, they will be crushed by the might of our 
economies. 
  [Giesbert] But is it not scandalous to leave them at the 
door, as we are doing, when they are knocking so loudly? 
  [Delors] If we accepted them tomorrow, they would face 
insurmountable economic problems, and that would mean a 
financial cost to us, in other words, to our taxpayers, and I am 
not sure that those who are saying today they have to come in 
immediately would be able to defend this stand tomorrow to the 
public. 
  [Giesbert] But is there not a danger of pushing them toward 
the East, toward adventurism, or toward Russia, or the Ukraine? 
  [Delors] No, because we have contracts of association with 
them, which enable us to work together and to ask them their 
opinions in the political, cultural, and economic fields. But 
the most important thing, you know, the thing that has to be 
understood is the historic duty of our generation, the one in 
charge at the moment, is to spread the values of peace, mutual 
understanding, and cooperation -- which, after all, have led to 
the success of this Europe -- to Europe as a whole, and hence to 
those countries. 
  [Giesbert] With all these countries joining and planning to 
join the European Union, we are moving toward a greater Europe, 
a mega-Europe, a Europe with 20 members; 12 was complicated 
enough, but 20? Will it not give you an amazing amount of work? 
  [Delors] It was complicated, but in spite of everything, 
there were happy moments. When you see, for example, that the 
events connected with German unification or with Yugoslavia did 
not lead to the resurgence of old antagonisms between Germany 
and its former opponents, that is grounds for satisfaction and 
shows that the fathers of Europe were right. 
  But now, there is a contradiction that has to be overcome. 
You are right. How can we simultaneously build a political 
Europe, in other words, made up of countries that want to share 
part of their destiny because they think they will build it 
better if they are together, given the amazing changes happening 
in the world, and the new risks, with a Europe made up of 22 or 
24 countries? [sentence as heard] [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] When do you envisage a Europe with the countries 
of East Europe? 
  [Delors] Oh, around the turn of the century. 
  [Giesbert] So it is a long way off? 
  [Delors] Yes. 
  [Giesbert] In the latest edition of the British magazine THE 
ECONOMIST, there is an interesting article that says that if 
Europe wants to exist, it should make examples of the 
troublemakers of Europe -- of whom there are quite a few. It 
suggests several candidates for expulsion: Greece, Greece, 
Greece, and then there is also Greece. Is this a good idea? 
  [Delors] No. You know, you have to distinguish between 
family spirit and disputes. 
  [Giesbert] But Greece is the bad pupil at the moment? 
  [Delors] No. Europe is based on a family spirit. In other 
words, we have decided to live together -- not in all areas: 
there are a lot of things that fortunately still remain in the 
purview of the nation-states. This demands a certain frame of 
mind. At the beginning of the Greek presidency, this frame of 
mind had been forgotten by the other countries. Now it is 
Greece that is forgetting it, and has to get back to it. In a 
family, you can have quarrels, but there are some things you 
must not do. 
  So Greece must pay heed, and for example, the embargo 
measures it has taken against the little republic of Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM] are not 
acceptable. 
  [Giesbert] The European Commission's white paper on 
employment and growth will go on sale today, published by Michel 
(?Lafon-Ramsay). It is called: Into the 21st Century. When you 
see the figures, is there not a European sickness of 
unemployment? 
  [Delors] Yes, there is a European sickness of unemployment, 
and that is why, back in June, I took it upon myself to 
demonstrate to the heads of state and government at their 
meeting in Copenhagen -- and for some of them it was a real 
shock -- that Europe was losing its competitiveness, and if it 
continued in the same way it would be unable to ensure equality 
for all the young people in finding jobs. 
  [Giesbert] With 16 million unemployed in Europe, is that not 
the result of inflexibility and obstacles everywhere? 
  [Delors] There are several reasons I can sum up like this: 
insufficient economic growth, insufficient competitiveness with 
regard to the outside world -- and we have new competitors 
coming in from Asia and the Pacific, and for that reason we have 
to think in the medium term -- and insufficient expertise in 
technical progress. [passage omitted] 
  [Giesbert] You are proposing more flexibility. That is what 
is interesting. Are you not, in fact, making very liberal 
proposals for a socialist? 
  [Delors] You know, for me, socialism means equality of 
opportunity and the opportunity for everyone to fulfill oneself 
by means of work in society. [passage omitted] 
  I will tell you about two lessons in the white paper that 
can 
be drawn from the experiences of all the European countries. 
First, work is too highly taxed, in particular in France, where 
80 percent of the financing of social security comes from wages. 
These contributions have to be brought down. It is ridiculous 
that the commodity that is in the shortest supply, the 
environment, is not taxed, while we need a healthy environment, 
for our health among other things, and that the resource that is 
in the greatest supply, labor, is what is most highly taxed. 
[passage omitted] Second, society tomorrow will be a society 
of skills, and therefore, of people who have both knowledge and 
skill, and knowledge and skill both demand a good education and 
high pay. 
  [Giesbert] Mr. Delors, you will leave the presidency of the 
Commission at the end of the year. Your successor will be 
appointed in June. It is said that Leon Brittan is a good 
candidate. Would that be a good thing? 
  [Delors] It is not for me to comment on that. It is up to 
the 12 heads of government to appoint my successor. I have been 
preparing the way for him as well as I can, leaving him with 
margins for maneuver so that he, in turn, can put his mark on 
the construction of Europe. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Enough Belgians in Bosnia -- </F>
Delcroix Does Not Intend To Increase Contingent of UN Troops"] 
  [Excerpt] Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix does not 
intend to send any more UN troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
According to the minister, the Belgian Army has reached the 
limit of its possibilities. It may well be that UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali has great admiration for the work done by 
the Belgian UN troops in Somalia, Rwanda, Croatia, and Bosnia, 
but other countries also must be approached for once, said the 
minister. 
  The minister was reacting to a report in the British SUNDAY 
TIMES claiming that, once again, Belgium will be asked to 
contribute together with Great Britain, France, and Sweden, 
another 5,000 UN troops for Bosnia. That is roughly half the 
figure requested by General Michael Rose, UN commander in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He believes these extra troops are 
necessary to maintain the cease-fires in Sarajevo and central 
Bosnia in the long term. Following fierce debates within the 
British Government, London said it would be prepared to send an 
additional 1,200 troops to Bosnia to reinforce the 2,500 British 
troops already there. However, London wants British soldiers to 
be accompanied by UN troops sent by other Western countries.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG)--Around 100,000 nationals 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) would be expelled 
for "lacking the legal right to stay in Germany," said on Monday 
[7 March] the press attache of the German Embassy in Belgrade, 
Ulrich Kine. 
  Kine told TANJUG that those who would have to leave Germany 
would be the nationals of Serbia and Montenegro (constituent 
states of the F.R.Y.) who had failed to legally regulate their 
stay in Germany. He said they were those who either had not 
sought asylum or had been denied it, or had no other right to 
stay any further in Germany. 
  The German authorities on Monday confirmed that they would 
begin to expel Yugoslav nationals on Thursday. Kine added that 
exempted from this decision were about 230,000 refugees with 
Yugoslav passports from the ex-Yugoslav Republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 
  "For now, the refugees from the BiH (Bosnia-Herzegovina) are 
to remain in Germany, while talks are in progress with Croatia 
about the procedures regarding the return of its refugees," Kine 
said. The German press, however, had announced that around 
200,000 people carrying Yugoslav passports would be expelled. 
  This was practically confirmed by the Interior Ministry of 
the state of North Rhine-Westphalia when it said that a first 
flight with 160 expelled would leave Germany on Thursday for the 
Romanian town of Timisoara, while more flights were scheduled 
for March 17, 24 and 31. From Timisoara, the expelled would 
travel by buses to the Yugoslav border. 
  On the list of those to be expelled, as was announced, the 
predominant number (near under 95 percent) accounts for ethnic 
Albanians from the Serbian province of Kosovo and Metohija. The 
expulsion of nationals with Yugoslav passports coincides with a 
hunt against and arrests of Serbs in Germany over their alleged 
war crimes in ex-Yugoslav territories. 
  In Germany, the decision on expelling Yugoslav nationals -- 
which appears to be, among other things, in the service of 
political pressure -- had spurred on hardly any protest other 
than that raised by the "Green" party. 
  Of the German papers, it was the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU alone 
that commented on the decision on Monday, stressing that 
"Germany's rush" to expel Yugoslav nationals was "shameful."

<F P=106> [Report by Randah Taqiyy-al-Din: "Al-Qaysi Meets With </F>
French Foreign Ministry Official"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Daniel Bouchard, head of the Middle East 
and North African Department at the French Foreign Ministry, 
yesterday received Riyad al-Qaysi, director of international 
affairs at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, who also met with 
Jean-Piere Lavon, director of the UN office at the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  Al-Qaysi's visit comes before the Security Council's 
reexamination in mid-March of the international sanctions 
imposed on Iraq. French sources have said that Iraqi officials 
are seeking to persuade Paris to intervene with its allies to 
lift the sanctions, especially as the Iraqi side "interpreted 
the French position as unrealistic." French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe spoke of progress in Iraq's implementation of the 
international resolutions. However, he urged the Iraqi 
authorities to recognize the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border demarcation 
and Kuwait. 
  The sources also said that al-Qaysi's visit comes after a 
visit by an Iraqi Oil Ministry delegation which left Paris after 
a series of meetings with representatives from the two companies 
Totale and Aquitaine, but it does not mean that France has 
abandoned its position of stressing the implementation of the 
Security Council resolution. 
  The sources said that Juppe does not receive Iraqi officials 
because relations are severed between the two countries. The 
sources pointed out that if Rolf Ekeus, head of the special UN 
committee, decides that Iraq has complied with the Security 
Council resolutions, [Iraq] can then enter the trial period 
[al-marhalah al-ikhtibariyah], which has not yet begun, for the 
long-term inspection of its weapons. 
  French officials stress that the embargo against Iraq would 
be lifted when the Security Council resolutions are complied 
with and the trial period -- six months -- begins. While the 
United States adopts a more hard-line position. The U.S. 
Administration has not specified the duration of the trial 
period. It says that for a period of time -- it may be long -- 
Iraq must show its willingness to implement all the 
international community's demands, beginning with implementation 
of the Security Council resolutions through to respect for human 
rights. 
  Despite the frequent visits to Paris by Iraqi officials -- 
including Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz, the Oil Ministry 
delegation, and al-Qaysi -- and the opening of an Iraqi 
interests office in France, run by Dr. Ahmad al-'Izzawi, who 
arrived in Paris recently, the French position on the embargo 
has not changed, nor will change as long as Iraq has not 
embarked on the trial period or fulfilled the requirements with 
regard to its recognition of Kuwait and the border demarcation.

<F P=106> [Report by Paolo Negro: "In Turin League Leader Attacks </F>
Allies, Promises, `We Will Have 200 Deputies'; Bossi: `They Are 
Sons of the Christian Democratic Party'"] 
  [Excerpt] Turin -- They came to the Carignano theater from 
all over Piedmont just for his sake, to hear what he had to say 
and to hear his attacks on Berlusconi and the parties. What was 
supposed to be the great meeting to present the League's 
candidates was in fact little more than a pretext. This was 
immediately apparent. It was clear later, too, when many people 
left after his speech. By then the show was over. 
  But [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi did not 
disappoint those who were expecting further polemics. He spoke 
for 50 minutes, launching some sustained attacks and, in order 
to remove any doubts, set his sights directly on [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi and the Christian Democrats. And he was 
shooting to kill. Following the skirmishes of the past few 
days, he made his intentions clear from the start: "Berlusconi 
is the synthesis of the five-party alliance." To avoid any 
misunderstandings, he added: "Our allies are a creation of the 
DC [Christian Democratic Party]. Before dying, the DC decided to 
create alternative structures that would enable the old leaders 
to return. But we saw through that. And we stopped them." 
  Before an audience that was full of smiles, applause, and 
scarves depicting Alberto da Giussano [medieval Lombard knight], 
the League leader continued with a crescendo of theories, 
explanations, and attacks. His reassuring, "we will honor the 
electoral agreement," was not enough to make him softer his 
tone. This, partly because he issued an explicit and 
uncompromising appeal: "On your gray ballot papers, the ones 
for the proportional quota, vote only for our symbol, and 
encourage others to do the same. Do not look at those of our 
allies. We must demonstrate our strength and make people 
understand that we have nothing to do with the others... We 
will have 200 deputies. We will not become confused with them, 
and that goes for the presentation of candidates, too: Those 
initiatives are Christian Democratic jamborees. But we are a 
force of the people." And the people -- or, at least, his 
people -- applauded him, interrupting him twice. First, they 
listened to the long story of the accord that led to the pole 
for freedoms, then it showed its appreciation of his umpteenth 
charge against the DC: "We destroyed the DC key which, though 
held in Palermo, in fact opened the strongholds of the North. 
and I am not accusing the people of the South; I am blaming the 
leadership class." 
  In the end none of the League's allies was spared. 
Berlusconi, the Christian Democratic Center, and the Center 
Union were analyzed, dissected, and overwhelmed by the torrent 
of a Bossi in full flow. It is no coincidence that he said not a 
word about the progressive forces, apart from a few very brief 
mentions such as, "they are the enemies to be defeated." With 
[Pact for Italy leader] Segni it was exactly the opposite: "He 
imagined that he could do whatever he pleased, but we fixed him 
right away. We forced him to return to grandpa [DC Secretary] 
Martinazzoli...." 
  So at least for Bossi, the grand coalition of the pole for 
freedoms was exclusively "a tactical choice." "Fellows," he 
shouted, "do you remember what I told you? Never lower your 
guard, do not trust anyone... Well, now I will repeat it even 
louder! Yes, because this alliance served solely to wreck the 
plans of those whose sole aim was to restore the Italian Social 
Movement's [MSI] strength and to crush us. But we saw through 
that and stopped them. And we will remain suspicious. Our 
allies will have to accept our idea of federalism; we will not 
allow ourselves to be enchanted by strange formulas... Have you 
never wondered why the DC accepted an electoral reform that 
decreed its demise? The answer is simple: It had already 
agreed to help the MSI in the South, and it had already given 
thought to some strange coalitions in the North." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Agriculture Needs 2 Billion Extra"] </F>
  [Text] Agriculture will need additional support of almost 
2 billion markkas next year if Finland joins the European Union 
[EU]. This was the assessment given by Foreign Minister Heikki 
Haavisto in Sunday's [6 March] TURUN SANOMAT. 
  According to Haavisto, the transition to the EU's pricing 
system means that the production price of certain products will 
be halved and the value of stockpiled products will fall. 
  According to Haavisto, 3 to 4 billion markkas in national 
agricultural support will be needed after the transitional 
period. This year direct support to agriculture will be 6.5 
billion markkas. 
  In TURUN SANOMAT Haavisto gave concrete figures for the 
additional support that Prime Minister Esko Aho said he believed 
would be necessary in the Eduskunta on Friday. Social 
Democratic circles have already been fairly critical of calls 
for additional support. The matter could also cause conflict in 
the government, since Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, 
the National Coalition Party chairman, has said that current 
levels of agricultural support ought to suffice even in a period 
of transition to the EU. 
  For his part Interior Minister Mauri Pekkarinen indicated on 
Sunday his readiness to finance the additional expense of EU 
membership by taking additional loans.

301: Twelve Disagree on Marrakesh Statement"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels -- The European Union (EU) will keep a 
very watchful eye on the latest U.S. trade measures. However, 
the Twelve are not considering a resort to a new trade tool of 
their own for now. In addition, the Twelve still openly 
disagree on the message they should tell the world on the 
occasion of the new world trade organization's inauguration. 
  In a common statement, the Twelve's foreign affairs 
ministers 
express their concern about the implementation of U.S. trade law 
Super 301. The EU Council condemns the use of such unilateral 
actions in international trade conflicts. The Twelve ask that 
all trade partners act according to the agreements reached 
within the framework of the multilateral GATT negotiations. The 
European Commission must thoroughly investigate whether the U.S. 
trade sanctions, which are directed against Japan, are a 
violation of the GATT agreeements. 
  However, the Twelve are not sharpening their knives right 
away. So far, the possible creation of a new European trade tool 
intended to protect the EU against unfair trade practices has 
been ruled out altogether. The Twelve agreed on this last 
December, when they ratified the GATT agreement. 
  On behalf of the Twelve, EU Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan 
outlined the provisional state of affairs regarding the 
commitments for market access. The latter revealed that the EU 
would scale down its original offer regarding trucks and 
nonferrous metals. The EU Commission is negotiating with the 
United States for an improved and more equitable offer.

  [Excerpt] Brussels, March 8 (AFP) -- The European Union 
[EU] and Norway were rapidly approaching a deal here Tuesday [8 
March] in their quarrel over fishing rights which has been 
blocking Norway's entry into the enlarging EU, diplomats said. 
  But they added that progress was slower in another dispute 
threatening to block membership for Austria, Finland and Sweden 
as well as Norway -- over how their entry would affect the 
delicate balance of power in the EU. 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he was "cautiously 
optimistic" that the EU would reach an accord with Norway later 
Tuesday over a Spanish demand for increased access to Norwegian 
cod. 
  He was speaking as the EU ministers were considering a new 
Norwegian offer to break the deadlock which has delayed 
agreement for Norway to join the 12-nation union along with the 
three other applicants on January 1. 
  Kinkel told journalists: "If we should succeed in getting a 
positive solution for Norway, I cannot imagine that the entire 
enlargement process will be blocked (by the balance of power 
dispute)." 
  Spain and Portugal are claiming the right to take about 
25,000 tonnes of cod a year out of Norwegian waters in return 
for accepting Norway into the EU -- a condition which Oslo has 
refused. 
  But a Norwegian diplomat said the EU had been offered a new 
and complicated fish catch formula which might satisfy Spain 
and "contains almost all the elements of an agreement." [passage

  [Text] The German foreign minister went into the 
negotiations on Norway's membership of the European Union 
optimistically. Shortly before midnight, however, an annoyed 
Klaus Kinkel had to announce the breakdown of the unsuccessful 
talks. His colleagues had worked on a compromise proposal on 
the fish issue in long, tough negotiations with the Norwegians. 
The Spaniards were to be given higher catch quotas in the 
future. But Madrid was unyielding. 
  [Begin recording] [Kinkel] The failure to resolve the fish 
issue is Spain's responsibility, and to a lesser extent 
Portugal's, but basically Spain's. We had put together a 
package -- the presidency, the Commission, and the Europeans, we 
Germans in particular -- we negotiated the issue bilaterally 
with Norway. The package didn't go far enough for the 
Spaniards. Great Britain was mainly responsible for the failure 
to reach agreement on majorities as it saw no possibility for 
agreement. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Over the last few weeks the 
impression has arisen that the Spaniards are resisting Norway's 
membership in principle. Do you think this impression is 
justified? 
  [Kinkel] No, I don't think this impression is justified. The 
Spaniards want Norway to join. They have their internal 
problems with the fish issue -- we have to understand that. On 
the other hand, I didn't really understand today why they had to 
exhaust this issue in such detail. In my opinion a solution 
should have been possible. No, Spain wants them to join but it 
will get a bit more difficult now. And Spain has to move now.

  [Text] The Nordic Council, which is meeting in Stockholm, 
held a lively discussion about Finland's, Sweden's and Norway's 
EU [European Union] negotiations. The debate revealed that 
Finland may be first among the Nordic countries to hold its own 
EU referendum, reports Kimmo Henriksson from the conference: 
  [Henriksson] Representing the Swedish Government, Social 
Affairs Minister Bengt Westerberg of the Liberal Party was most 
vociferous here in Stockholm in questioning the possibility of 
organizing Sweden's EU referendum as early as June. Westerberg 
thought the referendum would be postponed until November, after 
the Swedish elections. The Swedish Social Democrats have 
similar ideas. They fear that their supporters will, under a 
Conservative government, vote no simply to oppose Prime Minister 
Carl Bildt's policy. Bildt, himself, did not want to comment on 
the matter, but he, too, has suggested a summer or autumn 
referendum and may well have to give in to the latter. 
  The Swedish decision would naturally mean that Finland would 
have to hold its referendum as the first of the Nordic countries 
because Norway, if it reaches a negotiation result, is of course 
in no hurry. The order [in holding referendums] would then be 
the same as the EU recommended to the applicant countries. In 
Finland support for EU membership is clearly more extensive than 
in Sweden and Norway, so the example may be significant. 
  Opponents of EU membership have also let their voices be 
heard in Stockholm. Speeches by the opponents above all have 
expressed fear that Sweden's and Finland's policy of neutrality 
will disappear with EU membership. [Prime Minister] Esko Aho of 
Finland had to explain Finland's nonalignment to (?Joerleis 
Borgottansen) of the Icelandic left-wing party, who pointed out 
that only a few years ago Finland announced to the Nordic 
Council that its neutrality would be preserved. Lars Werner of 
the Swedish Party of the Left, for his part, wanted to discuss 
the possibility of Nordic security cooperation, even including 
military cooperation, as a counterbalance to EU membership. The 
proposal failed, of course, to please the Swedish Government. 
Carl Bildt had to walk to the rostrum several times to say that 
times had changed and consequently neutrality concepts also had 
changed. This is Kimmo Henriksson in Stockholm.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: No Progress in </F>
Norwegian Membership Talks"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 8 Mar (ANSA) -- A first day of talks, 
Monday [7 March], and overnight contacts between European Union 
officials and Norwegian representatives did nothing to smooth 
out difficulties in Norway's EU membership bid, Spanish sources 
said Tuesday. 
  "There was no progress overnight in negotiations on 
fishing," 
said Spain's Foreign Minister Javier Solana. 
  The main hitch in Norway's membership talks remains demands 
from Spain and Portugal that their fishing fleets should be able 
to net 14,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively of cod fish from 
Norwegian waters each year. Portugal, which considers cod its 
national dish, bought 40 percent of its total fish imports from 
Norway in 1993. 
  Norway has also refused to countenance demands from France 
and Ireland for limits on Norwegian fish exports. 
  The foreign ministers talks, which resumed here this 
morning, 
have also faltered over new decision-making procedures to be 
adopted when Sweden, Finland, Austria and possibly Norway join 
the Union. 
  Italy, Britain and Spain are demanding changes to the 
statute 
to make sure that small nations accounting for only small 
percentages of total EU population cannot veto decisions.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "Expansion: Claes Criticizes Spanish </F>
and Portuguese Intransigence"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 8 Mar (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes harshly criticized Spanish and Portuguese 
intransigence Tuesday [9 March] evening regarding the issue of 
fisheries, calling on these two countries to moderate their 
demands regarding access by their trawlers to Norwegian waters. 
  "Certain member states want to transform the European Union 
(EU) into a fish shop," he stated on the BRTN [Dutch-language 
Belgian Radio and Television]. According to him, tough words 
were expressed within the Council toward these two countries. 
"Too much is too much," he said, feeling that the demands made 
by these two countries is excessive. 
  Mr. Claes used the financial argument: "Spain and Portugal 
would be well-advised to take account of the fact that Norway 
will be a net contributor to the Community budget, with all the 
benefits which that implies for the four cohesion countries 
(Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Ireland -- editor's note)," he 
said. 
  The Belgian foreign minister added that Oslo had already 
taken two steps toward the EU: The first during its accession 
to the European Economic Area, the free-trade agreement between 
the EC and the EFTA countries (except Switzerland, which voted 
against it) which stipulates that the countries receiving 
cohesion funds should receive an extra fishing quota of 11,000 
tonnes of cod in Norwegian waters, and the second during the 
negotiations of recent days, during which "appreciable steps" 
have been taken. 
  Mr. Claes added that, nevertheless, he was still "confident" 
about the chances of unravelling this Gordian knot "this very 
night."

Europe"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 7 Mar (ANSA) -- The European Union's 
decision to approve an Italo-British proposal for 
institutionalisation of relations with Central and East Europe 
was described as "important and significant" by Italian Foreign 
Minister Beniamino Andreatta Monday [7 March]. 
  In comments to journalists here, Andreatta explained that 
the 
timetable for economic integration with the six former Soviet 
satellites would be dictated by "economic factors and therefore 
be rather slow." 
  But "threats of instability in Europe, such as those 
deriving 
from the situation in Moscow," he said, made "speeding up the 
timetable for political cooperation" essential. 
  Andreatta voiced hopes that the plan would soon be extended 
beyond Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania 
and Hungary to take in the three Baltic states as well.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "Fishing and Balance of Power in </F>
Council Threaten Enlargement"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 9 Mar (Belga) -- Negotiations between the 
foreign ministers of the Twelve and Norway with a view to Norway 
joining the European Union (EU) again ended in stalemate at the 
end of Tuesday [8 March] evening due to dissension among the 
Twelve on the issues of fishing rights and the modification of 
the institutions with the arrival of four new Member States. 
  Greek European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos could 
not 
hide his vexation as he told the press: "The result was not 
positive this evening, I am sorry to say, and I do not 
understand why." He could only draw a favorable conclusion from 
talks in other areas still outstanding, such as agriculture, the 
budget, and regional policy. 
  Since no compromise solution seems possible in the immediate 
future, Mr. Pangalos, whose country currently has the EU 
presidency, decided to reconvene the ministers in Brussels next 
Tuesday, with the firm intention of settling the bones of 
contention that separate the United Kingdom and Spain from their 
10 partners. 
  Between now and then, he hopes that the contacts that 
ministers are sure to have with their respective heads of state 
and government will make it possible to smooth out the 
differences that are still preventing the formal conclusion of 
the membership negotiations for the four candidate countries 
(Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway). 
  This is already the second time that the talks have been 
postponed, with the Twelve and Norway being forced to separate 
last Tuesday on a note of disagreement. Since then, Oslo has 
made overtures to Spain and Portugal by giving their trawlers a 
little more access to its rich fishing grounds. 
  According to Piet Dankert, Netherlands state secretary for 
foreign affairs, Portugal seems ready to reconsider its 
position, but Spain remains unconvinced and has a problem with 
the respect of its "historic rights" to fish in the Norwegian 
waters, abolished by Oslo in 1981 because of the depletion of 
fish stocks. 
  The president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, 
intervened in the debate to try and get the EU out of this rut, 
in particular by proposing the purchase of fishing quotas in the 
waters of third countries such as Canada and Russia and the 
termination in 1996 of the transition period decided when Spain 
and Portugal joined the Community in 1986, this condition 
initially restricted both these countries to 300 trawlers 
authorized to fish in Community waters until the year 2003. 
  However, a number of countries, including France refused 
bluntly to accept this proposal: "We were unable to obtain a 
mandate for the renegotiation of the membership treaty for Spain 
and Portugal," explained Mr. Lamassoure. 
  Added to this is the problem of adapting the minority veto 
in 
the Council of Ministers with the arrival of the four new 
members. The United Kingdom and Spain, and to a lesser extent 
Italy, demanded that this minority remain at 23 votes, which 
would make it easier to block Council decisions. The nine other 
delegations wanted it increased to 27 votes by simple 
mathematical extrapolation, in accordance with the mandate of 
the European Council summit of Lisbon in June 1992. 
  Italy finally agreed to a compromise proposal presented by 
the Greek presidency which suggested a minority veto of 27 votes 
but with the political undertaking that a consensus would be 
sought if there was a minority veto of 23 votes. Spain and the 
United Kingdom, however, remained unbending. 
  Hope now lies in calming the concerns being expressed by the 
governments. However, Mr. Dankert stated that "while last 
Tuesday it seemed that the foreign ministers could not reach an 
agreement on the Council voting balance, it is possible that the 
debate could be switched in the very short term to the level of 
the European Council." 
  Several delegations had harsh words for the stance being 
taken by the United Kingdom and Spain. 
  Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, speaking on BRTN 
[Dutch- language Belgian Radio and Television]: "Certain Member 
States want to transform the EU into a fish shop. Too much, it 
is too much." 
  Alain Lamassoure, the French minister for European affairs, 
stated: "Now the moment of truth has come, we are seeing who 
really does and does not want enlargement (...). For certain 
countries, the EU enlargement is being seen as the opportunity 
to complicate or even paralyze Community life." 
  This second breakdown in negotiations directly poses the 
question of the attitude of the European Parliament (EU), which 
wanted to have a membership treaty fully drawn up and ready for 
10 March, that is Thursday, at the latest, so that a decision 
could be taken at May's session which is the last one before 
June's European elections. 
  The European commissioner charged with the enlargement 
issue, 
the Netherlander Hans Van den Broek, was expected to address the 
EP on Wednesday where he is to ask the European deputies to 
grant a "period of grace" of five days for submitting these 
documents.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Italy Blocks Budget </F>
Citing GDP Criteria"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 8 Mar (ANSA) -- Citing "general policy 
reservations," Italy barred implementation of the European Union 
[EU] budget reform that had been agreed on at the Edinburgh 
summit of 1992, diplomatic sources said. EU foreign ministers 
failed to approve the budget reform that would base 
contributions in direct proportion to gross domestic product 
levels and in inverse proportion to VAT [value-added tax] rates. 
  Italy said its reform of the calculation by which GDP [gross 
domestic product] is calculated put it at a disadvantage in 
relation to other EU countries that have not yet carried out 
that change in the way production levels are estimated. 
  According to Italian representatives, that discrepancy could 
cost Italy 1 trillion lire yearly in EU budget contributions. 
  Italian sources also cited the outstanding dispute between 
Italy and the EU on milk quotas, arguing these could cost Italy 
between 2.5 and 5 trillion lire if quotas remain at present 
levels. Italy believes the EU has not moved quickly enough on 
agricultural reform where the Mediterranean products are 
concerned, and that further negotiations are needed on 
agro-monetary realignment.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE (GGD): "GATT: Brussels and Paris Do </F>
Not Forget Social and Environmental Questions"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 7 Mar (BELGA) -- On Monday [7 March], 
Belgium and France urged their partners in the European Union 
(EU) to go to Marrakech, where the final agreement concluding 
the Uruguay Round is to be signed in April, armed with a draft 
joint declaration stressing the importance of the environment 
and social protection within the future WTC [World Trade 
Organization]. 
  "France and Belgium are thinking along the same lines on 
this 
matter," a Belgian diplomatic source stated. 
  The question of a ministerial declaration to be added to the 
final document establishing the agreement of the 117 GATT 
members on greater liberalization of world trade has yet to be 
settled. 
  Several signatory countries are opposed to it and the 
European Trade Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, who negotiated on 
behalf of the Twelve, is reportedly in favor of a general 
declaration which they would all support. 
  "The EU must submit a text offering a broader vision of 
links 
between trade and the environment, and between trade and social 
protection," a Belgian source indicated. 
  These questions "received too little attention during the 
Uruguay Round," Robert Urbain, the Belgian European affairs 
minister, told his colleagues at the Council of Ministers. 
  "We must make the most of the Marrakech conference to make 
up 
for this shortcoming, and in sufficiently broad terms to lay 
down genuine avenues for future thought rather than simply 
listing the most flagrant excesses such as slavery or forced 
labor," he added. 
  Belgium therefore recommends the drawing up of "an agenda 
for 
the future" in order to strengthen "the link between social 
rights, the environment and trade," Mr. Urbain stated. 
  France and Belgium head the "maximalists" who favor a 
declaration by the Twelve "making it clearly known that the EU 
intends to see the World Trade Organization launch a global 
debate on the environment and the social question," explained a 
senior Belgian civil servant. 
  The Twelve have unanimously condemned the American decision 
to reintroduce the so-called super 301 procedure which allows 
the United States to take retaliatory measures against countries 
which fail to sufficiently open up their markets to U.S. 
products. 
  "This measure does not directly affect us for the moment, 
but 
the Twelve believe that the use of this section sends out a bad 
signal just before the signing of an agreement that is supposed 
to commit everyone to a multilateral settlement of trade 
differences," stressed a Belgian source.

<F P=106> [Article signed MPK/MPN/GGD: "Mr. Havel Asks European Union </F>
To Show Moral Dimension"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 8 Mar (BELGA) -- "The development of the 
European identity and its accessibility to everyone," is the 
main challenge the European Union (EU) will have to meet if it 
wants to ensure its viability, Czech Republic President Vaclav 
Havel said, in substance, on Wednesday [2 March] to the European 
Parliament [EP] in Strasbourg. 
  The Maastricht Treaty is a "remarkable work," a "perfect 
machine," but this "grandiose administrative machinery" is 
lacking a "spiritual, moral or emotional dimension," said Mr. 
Havel during a speech that was loudly applauded by the members 
of the European Parliament. 
  "Many people could have the impression that the EU consists 
of interminable debates on the quantity of carrots that some 
people are authorized to export to other people, or on the body 
that sets or checks quotas," said the Czech head of state. 
  To remedy this situation, the EU must now engage in renewed 
debate on the European identity, he added. He also suggested 
that the EU draw up a charter clearly defining its major ideas, 
its meaning, and the values to which it aims to give substance. 
"If the citizens of Europe understand this is not just a 
restrictive, anonymous bureaucratic monster that goes so far as 
to deprive them of their identity, but a new model for the human 
community, which, on the contrary, considerably broadens their 
freedom, then the EU will have nothing to fear as regards its 
future," he said. 
  Mr. Havel also reiterated the Czech Republic's wish to 
accede 
to the EU, although he did not set a date for accession, and 
Europe's interest as a whole in seeing the EU expand by 
insisting on the interdependence of the various regions of the 
European continent. 
  European history shows that "calm, peace, and prosperity 
cannot flourish in one part of Europe, without taking account of 
what is happening in the other part," he added. "The Cold War 
era, during which the cohesion imposed in the Soviet bloc 
nourished the cohesion of the West, is definitely over," and the 
events in the former Yugoslavia remind us that "disturbances, 
chaos, and violence are, by nature, infectious and contagious," 
he continued. 
  He reminded the listeners that the Czech Republic and the EU 
have been linked since last October by an association agreement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Calmer EU/U.S. Relations Look Likely </F>
for 1994"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] Relations between the European Union and the United 
States appear to be heading for calmer waters during 1994, in 
contrast to 1993, when trade talks and foreign policy 
differences made conditions somewhat testy. Bilateral talks 
between senior officials in Brussels on February 2 left both 
sides talking of a "friendly" atmosphere which had brought the 
Europeans and Americans closer together on issues including 
policy on Russia, trade with Japan and on the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. The U.S. Under Secretary for Economic and 
Agricultural Affairs, Joan Spero, said after the talks that she 
hoped for gentler exchanges on EU/US trade in audiovisual 
products, one of the hotly-contested elements in the recent GATT 
Round of trade talks. "We would like to find a way to have a 
somewhat quieter dialogue," she said, a line which the 
Commission later welcomed. 
  Officials also agreed to set up an "early warning system" to 
identify and deal with bilateral disputes, nearly a year after 
the idea was first floated, and discussed the "new generation of 
sectors" within GATT, notably the environment, the possibility 
of a social clause in trade rules and competition issues. The 
European side also sought and received reassurances from the 
U.S. officials that the EU would be kept informed of the ongoing 
U.S./Japan trade negotiations. Finally, Under Secretary Spero 
announced that U.S. and EU scientists were to organise contacts 
on possible cooperation in work on information technology. 
Other possible areas singled out for EU/U.S. cooperation 
include mobile satellite phones, pesticides and environmental 
questions related to packaging waste.

  3. The parties welcomed this inaugural meeting of the 
Association Council, following the entry into force on 1 
February 1994 of the Europe agreement between the European Union 
and Hungary. They regard the meeting not only as a symbol of the 
important new stage reached in their relations, but also as a 
practical step towards achieving the goals set out in the 
agreement including, ultimately, the common goal of Hungary's 
future membership of the Union which guides the co-operation 
between the parties. 
  The Association Council welcomed the entry into force of the 
treaty on European Union as a further impetus to the process of 
co-operation and integration in Europe. 
  4. The parties discussed a number of political issues and 
confirmed the importance of maintaining a bilateral political 
dialogue in accordance with the provisions of the Europe 
Agreement. 
  The parties noted with satisfaction that a multilateral 
framework for a strenghtened political dialogue and consultation 
on matters of common interest has been set up by the Copenhagen 
European Council; they looked forward to its full 
implementation. On this basis, the Association Council also 
welcomed the fact that at the initiative of Foreign Ministers 
Hurd and Andreatta the Council is currently considering 
modalities to further intensify multilateral political dialogue 
with the associated countries. 
  The Association Council is deeply concerned by the 
continuing 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia. Both parties welcomed recent 
promising developments on Sarajevo and the agreement between the 
Bosnian and Croat sides as important steps towards ending the 
war throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. They expressed their full 
support for an early negotiated settlement between all the 
parties involved in the conflict on the basis of the European 
Union action plan. During the discussion, the Hungarian side 
described its special situation and sacrifices in connection 
with the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. 
  The European Union side expressed its understanding in this 
context. 
  The parties agreed on the utility of sustained and concerted 
efforts in order to preserve the peace and stability and to 
enhance mutual understanding and peaceful relationships on the 
European continent. In this context, they looked forward to 
continuing consultations on the preparation of a conference 
launching the stability pact, which is the subject of a joint 
action of the European Union. 
  5. The Association Council welcomed the success of Hungary 
in establishing stability of democratic institutions, the rule 
of law and the respect of human rights. It welcomed also the 
progress made towards completing the process in transition to a 
functioning market economy. It recalled the Community's 
commitment, expressed most recently by the European Council in 
Copenhagen last June, to assist in that process. The 
Association Council agreed that the implementation of the Europe 
Agreement should play an important role in promoting sustainable 
non-inflationary growth and in further liberalizing and 
integrating European markets.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU/ASEAN: Cooperation Committee </F>
Seeks Better Trade Links"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS 
Database] 
  [Text] An appeal for stronger and more diverse links 
between the European Union [EU] and the six-member Association 
of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as for the 
abolition of trade barriers between the two regions, was 
launched by the on January 23 at the close of its three-day 
meeting in Davao (Philippines). The Committee, a consultative 
forum which meets every 18 months and involves essentially 
economic experts from the Union and ASEAN, spent much of its 
latest meeting hammering out ways of improving trade, industrial 
cooperation and the possibilities of direct European investment, 
technology transfer and financing. 
  The meeting agreed that market access should be widened in 
areas such as intellectual property and services, a point on 
which EU officials had voiced particular concern, as they did 
over the lack of progress made by the members of ASEAN in 
reducing their nontariff barriers despite the commitment the 
latter made to do so during the Uruguay Round multilateral trade 
negotiations. The Europeans are also keen to see a more 
concerted ASEAN approach on tariff reductions, which vary widely 
from one country to another. 
  On the ASEAN side, much was made of the difficulties of 
access to the European market for products such as tinned tuna. 
"These concerns could be lessened by regular consultations 
designed to clarify specific problems, coupled with assurances 
from the EU that its market would remain open to ASEAN 
products," declared the ASEAN spokeswoman, Delia Albert. Things 
may not prove as straightforward as ASEAN would like, as one of 
the main obstacles to market access for ASEAN products is EU 
quality requirements, according to the European Commission's 
Director-General for North-South Relations, Juan Prat. The EU, 
which is ASEAN's third largest trade partner after Japan and the 
United States (bilateral trade amounted to 54 billion dollars in 
1993), nonetheless remains committed to supporting the 15-year 
free trade programme just launched by the six members of the 
Association (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore and Thailand).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Energy Policy: Energy Council To </F>
Set Priorities for Future Action"; as released by Brussels 
Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] Work proceeds apace towards the inclusion in the 
Treaty of Maastricht of an explicit article on European energy 
policy when the Treaty is reviewed in 1996. The EU [European 
Union] Member States' energy bosses will be meeting officials 
from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy 
(DGXVII) on April 22 to study a text which will form the basis 
of a Communication to be submitted to the EU Energy Council on 
May 25, with the aim of feeding the energy policy debate. Their 
deputies will be in Brussels on March 24 to go over an informal 
version of the document with DGXVII. On the basis of the 
Communication, the May 25 Council will strive to establish 
energy policy priorities, on the basis of which the following 
Energy Council, held under the German Presidency of the Council, 
will be able to adopt working guidelines and energy policy 
objectives for 2005. The next step will be to prepare a text 
for inclusion in the Maastricht Treaty. DGXVII also expects to 
publish its Annual Energy Review, analysing energy trends 
throughout the world region by region, possibly as early as 
April. 
<H5>  De Facto Liberalisation </H5>
  The forthcoming meetings with the top national civil 
servants 
working in the energy field are the first since September 30 
last year, when the Commission, believing the Member States' 
Directors-General for Energy had realised the international 
energy market would not let them move in any direction other 
than towards greater liberalisation, flexibility and 
competitiveness, invited them to engage in informal talks 
outside the framework of the routine attitudes customarily 
expressed on energy matters. 
  This led to a debate centred on a macroeconomic and 
policy-oriented discussion paper entitled "The European 
Community: New Orientations in Energy -- The Economic 
Foundations." The aim now is to conduct a much more analytical 
examination of the supply side of the equation. 
  During the preparation of the Maastricht Treaty, the 
proposed 
text for an energy policy chapter was thrown out by the Member 
States. This was due in part to a certain amount of last-minute 
horse-trading but also stemmed from the Member States' belief 
that the energy policy objectives set out in the draft text 
submitted by DGXVII were too "irresponsible" to be acceptable. 
Over the last two years, events have moved on, Commission 
energy experts now believe, and while the Member States may not 
yet accept wholeheartedly the need for competition on the EU's 
captive Internal Market, they have generally acknowledged the 
contradiction of playing their ultra-liberal cards abroad and 
resisting liberalisation at home. In addition to changes in 
their own domestic energy set-ups, European producers are 
increasingly looking to invest in non-EU energy markets, 
particularly in East Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where 
they are forced to compete with other giants like the United 
States and Japan at prices much closer to cost. 
  With the EU now much further along the Single Market road 
and 
the Delors White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment 
providing an impetus to boost Europe's competitive position, 
there is now a much clearer political base on which to attempt 
the construction of a specific, coherent European energy 
strategy. 
<H5>  Investment Implications </H5>
  The discussion paper on which the current round of talks is 
based hammers home the point that the Union's energy demand 
continues to grow and that its dependence on conventional 
thermal power plants is likely to continue well into the 21st 
century. In view of the long lead-times required to bring new 
plant onstream, the implications for investment are important. 
Investment decisions taken during the 1990's, particularly in 
respect to electricity generation, will affect the energy sector 
for the next 20-30 years. These effects will be very difficult 
to reverse without enormous cost, the Commission warns. 
<H5>  EU Energy Priorities </H5>
  EU energy priorities, as DGXVII sees them, revolve around 
the 
need: 

  -  to get the white paper plans for major trans-European 
energy networks on the rails; 
  -  to use the energy potential of the 
Union's peripheral regions to best effect through greater 
cohesion; 
  -  to sustain and develop European technological 
expertise and more rational energy use, through such initiatives 
as the Thermie demonstration programme; 
  -  to respect the EU's 
environmental commitments, while continuing to guarantee the 
security of energy supplies; 
  -  to diversify sources of supply away 
from heavy dependence on the Middle East; and 
  -  to fulfill the 
EU's responsibilities beyond its borders, particularly as 
regards the economic and political stability of the transition 
economies of East Europe. The completion of the pan-European 
Energy Charter, whose next week-long plenary session begins on 
March 7, is seen as a crucial element in this respect. 
<H5>  Open Questions </H5>
  While circumstances may now be more propitious to the 
fully-fledged revival of the EU energy policy debate than they 
were two years ago, the horizon is far from clear. The current 
Commission's term of office is drawing to a close, as is that of 
the European Parliament, whose say in energy matters increased 
with the extra legislative powers brought by the Maastricht 
Treaty. It also remains to be seen exactly on what terms 
oil-rich Norway and the other three accession candidate 
countries join the Union. 
  Security of supply remains a major bone of contention. In 
fact, part of the Commission's thinking in establishing informal 
top-level discussions with the Member States was to avoid 
conducting the talks, for the time being, through the Council 
Energy Working Group. The latter has a reputation for beginning 
any debate on energy policy with the matter of security of 
supply and then getting bogged down in interminable discussions 
over how this relates to the principle of subsidiarity. 
  In this context, the question of specific EU-wide 
arrangements for crisis management within the framework of 
International Energy Authority action, still has to be 
addressed. Discussions appear to be getting nowhere and the 
subject has not figured on recent Energy Council agendas. 
DGXVII officials are now saying former Energy Commissioner 
Antonio Cardoso e Cunha was "mistakenly" understood to be 
pressing for Community ownership of basic fuel stocks rather 
than Community management of supplies. They acknowledge that to 
be palatable to Member States, provisions for a distinct Union 
safeguard mechanism will probably have to come out of the 
proposal. On the other hand, the "U.S.-dominated" IEA has since 
declared itself in favour of Union membership, somewhat tipping 
the balance towards such a development. The trick now will be to 
strike a happy medium between areas of Union and national Member 
State competence.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Research: 4th Framework Programme </F>
Decision in Hands of Conciliation Committee"; as released by 
Brussels Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] During the March 4 Research Council, the Greek 
Minister chairing the sitting is likely to invoke the new 
co-decision procedure and convene the Conciliation Committee 
made up of the 12 EU Research Ministers, their representatives 
and just as many Euro-MPs, and it will be the Committee's job to 
try to reach an agreement on the Council of Ministers' common 
position on the 4th Framework Programme of research and 
technological development (1994-98). Qualified majority support 
from the two sides is needed for the common position to be 
adopted and if this is not forthcoming, the Programme could be 
caught up in an inter-institutional game of ping-pong that could 
would put a serious question mark over the possibility of it 
starting up within the prescribed period of time. This, the 
first application of the co-decision procedure that was ushered 
in by the Maastricht Treaty, poses several basic questions about 
inter-institutional symmetry. 
<H5>  Ten Parliamentary Amendments </H5>
  It was last February 9 that the European Parliament returned 
its Opinion on its second reading of the programme and adopted 
10 amendments to the Council of Ministers' common position. The 
changes mainly affect the overall budget and its spread among 
the various activities, its annual schedule and the role of the 
Joint Research Centre. 
<H5>  Budget Amendments </H5>
  The Parliament has asked for the overall Framework Programme 
budget to be plumped up by ECU400 million so as raise the total 
agreed upon by Ministers from ECU10.746 billion to ECU11.146 
billion. Ministers also decided that the sum could be increased 
to as much as ECU11.441 billion in 1996, in the light of the 
Programme's progress, the general economic circumstances and the 
Union's budgetary situation at the time. The Parliament 
contests these criteria and reckons that the total should be 
raised to at least ECU12.041 billion in the light of an 
assessment of the cost/benefit ratio and the application of the 
programme, not in accordance with the economic or budgetary 
situation. The Parliament also takes exception to the way the 
money is being shared out among the two periods -- ECU5.283 
billion for 1994-1996 and ECU5.463 billion for 1997-1998 - and 
proposes the following annual formula: 
  - 1994: ECU10 million 
  - 1995: ECU3.013 billion 
  - 1996: ECU3.252 billion 
  - 1997: ECU3.199 billion 
  - 1998: ECU2.926 billion 
  - Total updated: ECU12.4 billion 
  The Parliament also has its ideas about how to spread the 
overall resources among the different research activities. It 
proposes another ECU140 million for the first Activity (research 
programmes), including an additional ECU20 million for 
electronic data transmission, ECU70 [million] for industrial 
technologies and materials, ECU16 [million] for non-nuclear 
energy and 34 for targeted social and economic research. It 
proposes to add ECU180 million for the second set of activities 
(international cooperation), including ECU50 [million] for 
initiatives to combat environmental and health problems in the 
countries of the former Soviet Union. It is asking for an 
additional ECU80 million for the third action on 
disseminating/exploiting research findings. 
<H5>  Exposing the JRC to More Limited Competition </H5>
  The European Parliament takes the view that the competition 
that the Council wants to expose the Joint Research Centre [JRC] 
to is too much. It proposes to boost the JRC budget for its 
specific programme activities (ECU619 million, against ECU575 
[million] in the common position) and to reduce the amount 
earmarked for activities opened up to competition (ECU66 
million, against ECU91 million). 
  According to the Parliament, JRC activities should be opened 
up to competition by no more than 15 to 20 percent in the case 
of the Framework Programme (against 24 percent in the common 
position) and 7 to 10 percent in the case of the nuclear energy 
research component (against 10 percent). 
<H5>  Committee Procedures, Scientific Control and Aims </H5>
  The Parliament also sees advantage in gradually integrating 
the research activities in the coal and steel sector, now 
covered by the ECSC Treaty, into the Framework Programme. For 
example, MEPs want technological and social research operations 
that have a bearing on the coal and steel sector to be included 
in the appropriate specific research programme. 
  As for the specific programme on targeted social and 
economic research, the Parliament wants to include a new 
research strand aimed at promoting security and health at work 
and achieving harmonisation in this realm. 
  Several parliamentary amendments seek to ensure that the 
Programme is monitored by independent outside experts. When it 
comes to committee procedures, the Parliament suggests adding to 
the Framework Programme decision an annex providing for the 
adoption (in the context of the implementation of specific 
programmes) of joint implementation procedures to be established 
by means of an inter-institutional agreement. 
<H5>  Convening the Conciliation Committee </H5>
  In the early stages of its March 4 sitting, the Research 
Council will more likely than announce that it is impossible to 
take on board all the amendments and will then convene the 
Conciliation Committee as is provided for by the co-decision 
procedure. 
<H5>  First Test for New Co-decision Procedure </H5>
  The long-drawn-out passage of the 4th Framework Programme 
has 
provided the first opportunity for the first purposeful 
application of the new co-decision procedure established under 
the Maastricht Treaty. The procedure can be avoided only if the 
Council nods through all the Parliamentary amendments and this 
is extremely unlikely in the present case. 
  Some of the amendments, such as those to do with the JRC's 
nuclear research activities, are disapproved of quite strongly 
by Ministers. The co-decision procedure applies only to the EU 
Treaty not the Euratom one and some Member States want the 
amendments proposed for nuclear energy to be rejected. 
  The Greek Presidency's agenda therefore includes a meeting 
of 
the Conciliation Committee in the afternoon of 4 March, at the 
end of the Council sitting. There are two possible 
outcomes: 

  -  either the Council members or their 
representatives and European Parliament representatives, that go 
to make up the Committee, agree, each by a qualified majority, 
on a common project. They have six weeks to do so, after which 
the two institutions have a further six weeks to approve (by a 
qualified majority in the case of the Council and an absolute 
majority in the case of the Parliament) the inter-institutional 
agreement. Should this come to pass, the Framework Programme 
may be adopted fairly soon, 
  -  or the Committee fails to reach an 
agreement on a common project. 
  The Council thus has six weeks within which to confirm, by a 
qualified position, its common position, possibly combined with 
one or another Parliamentary amendment. If the latter is not 
pleased with the situation, it may act by an absolute majority 
to reject the common position. 
  These time limits may be extended, if need be, by several 
months, so the Framework Programme could be delayed quite 
seriously if the second possibility were to become true. 
<H5>  Inter-institutional Symmetry </H5>
  Theoretically, the Council should be able to adopt the 
Euratom part of the Framework Programme by means of a 
consultation pure and simple with the Parliament and without 
taking account of the latter's amendments. 
  The risk there, however, would be that the Parliament would 
dig its wheels in over the non-Euratom component and apply the 
co-decision procedure right to the bitter end. In order to stop 
this from happening, the Council has agreed to make a linkage 
between the two decisions and not to adopt the Euratom part as 
long as the other part of the Framework Programme has not been 
adopted as well. 
  This first application of a decision covered by the 
co-decision procedure provides the Member States with clear 
evidence of to what extent the Parliament's powers have been 
increased under the Maastricht Treaty and this is not entirely 
to their liking. During preliminary talks within Council working 
groups, several Member States expressed concern about what 
effect the co-decision procedure is having on the 
inter-institutional balance. If the Council wants to avoid the 
conciliation procedure, it has to say "aye" to all the 
parliamentary amendments. The UK takes the view that in general 
the Council cannot always cave in to the Parliament's demands so 
as to avoid getting ensnared in a lengthy and convoluted process. 
<H5>  White Paper and Cooperation with EEA Countries </H5>
  After mooting whether to take on board all the parliamentary 
amendments, and, if need be, convene the Conciliation Committee 
at the end of the Council sitting, Ministers are expected to 
discuss what contribution research policy is making to the White 
Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment and the debate 
is likely to use as its starting point a report by Antonio 
Ruberti, the European Commissioner for Research. 
  Next an informal gathering is scheduled to take place 
between 
Research Ministers from the five EFTA countries that have signed 
the European Economic Area Agreement (Austria, Finland, Sweden, 
Norway and Iceland) so as to consider the opportunities for 
cooperation between the EU and the EFTA countries in the EEA.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Central Bank Governors on Inflation, </F>
Continuity"] 
  [Text] Basel, 8 Mar (ANSA) -- European central bank 
governors will be keeping a weather eye on price rises but will 
stick to current economic policy, it was decided during their 
regular meeting in Basle, Tuesday [8 March], well-informed 
sources said. 
  Inflation seems to have been brought under control, reaching 
close to zero in France and suffering only minor hiccoughs in 
Germany, and market ups and downs have been proved nothing but 
temporary hitches in what is a mainly stable environment. 
  These elements, the sources said, prompted something akin to 
optimism amongst the European bank governors, who may now begin 
putting pressure on Germany to separate its economic policy from 
that of the United States, where recovery is already under way. 
Germany will be asked to act for itself with greater 
determination. 
  The Germans have promised not to let future decisions be 
overshadowed by January's massive growth in money supply, and 
other European nations are now looking forward to a downturn in 
interest rates, the sources said.

released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 7 Mar (BELGA) -- Robert Urbain, Belgian 
minister for foreign trade and European affairs, has affirmed 
that he was astonished at U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision 
to reintroduce the "Super 301" procedure. 
  This unilateral measure permits the United States to take 
retaliatory measures against countries that are opening up their 
markets insufficiently to U.S. products. 
  "Although this decision has been dictated by the U.S.' vast 
trade deficit ($59.3 billion) with Japan," Robert Urbain 
continued in a press release issued in Brussels on Monday [7 
March], "the moment chosen to announce this measure is entirely 
inappropriate, since it comes just after the conclusion of the 
arduous negotiations on a GATT agreement thatwill be signed 
officially one month from now in Marrakesh." 
  Mr. Urbain said that, "without seeking to attach too much 
importance to the effects on our foreign trade caused by 
resorting to this `Super 301' weapon, which must be considered 
more as a means of dissuasion and whose reintroduction is 
certainly also motivated by domestic policy considerations," its 
use "runs totally counter to the procedures aimed at combatting 
unfair competition." 
  "Falling back on unilateralism to resolve trade conflicts 
should be avoided at all costs," the foreign trade minister 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "Mr. Delcroix Confirms Chile's </F>
Interest in Mirage Fighters"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 8 March (BELGA) -- Belgian Defense 
Minister Leo Delcroix confirmed on Tuesday [8 March] that Chile 
had expressed an interest in purchasing the 20 modernized 
Mirage-5's which have been rendered redundant by restructuring 
of the Army. 
  Chilean Defense Minister Patricio Rojas had announced in 
Santiago on Monday the purchase from Belgium of 20 Mirage 
fighters of French design as part of the modernization of the 
Chilean Air Force. 
  Following a joint sales mission by the Sabca [Belgian 
Aeronautic Construction Company] aviation company and the 
Belgian Air Force, Chile has shown an interest in 20 Mirage 
fighter bombers modernized under the Mirship [Mirage System 
Improvement Program] program in order to replace its Hawker 
Hunters which are now obsolete, Mr. Delcroix indicated in a 
communique. 
  Mr. Delcroix reports that a Chilean Air Force delegation 
will 
be coming to Belgium in order to inspect the equipment which is 
being produced at the Sabca factory in Gosselies. This meeting 
should result in a contract being signed before 1 July, Mr. 
Delcroix added. 
  Military and industrial sources report that a Belgian 
delegation visited Chile at the end of February in order to 
negotiate the signing of a letter of intent on 28 February 
concerning 20 aircraft, 15 BA single-seaters and five BD 
twin-seaters. 
  The Defense Ministry has refused to confirm the amount of 
the 
Chilean contract, estimated to be 85.5 million dollars (about 3 
billion Belgian francs) including spares, maintenance, and 
personnel training. 
  This is the first big sale of heavy military equipment 
rendered redundant by the restructuring of the Belgian Army as 
decided by the government last year, observers note.

  [Text] London, March 8 (CTK) -- After a series of talks 
with British officials Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said on 
Tuesday [8 March] it was "refreshing" and "very pleasant to be 
in England where the majority of opinions were expressed in a 
way and in a tone very close to ours." 
  Klaus, however, did not specify what he meant by the term 
"ours" -- those of the Czech government, his ruling Civic 
Democratic Party (ODS), the Czech Republic in general or his own. 
  He said that "emphases laid in Britain are closer to our 
emphases than in some other European countries." In a meeting 
with Czech journalists, however, he did not elaborate. 
  In London, Klaus did not sign any agreements. He said he did 
not expect any impulse for Czech-British trade to result from 
his current visit. "It is not the business of premiers," he 
said, but added that talks he held in Britain dealt with the 
Czech Republic, which was "highly" esteemed there. 
  Asked by CTK about a possible message for discussion on the 
Czech Republic's future local administrative arrangement which 
might ensue from the fact that Britain is a strictly unitary 
state, Klaus stressed the "necessity of the existence of a 
powerful state against the rest of the world." 
  "The Czech lands were always strong enough when they had a 
powerful king and not when the estates argued and divided the 
country into many parts. The unitary character of Britain thus 
belongs to the same logic of my considerations," Klaus said. 
  On his visit to the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD), he said that "the unreal character of how it 
was built at the cost of investments in countries that would 
need it was quite interesting for me." 
  Klaus delivered a speech to a luncheon organized in central 
London by the Adam Smith Institute.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Doing the Right Thing, Cautiously"] </F>
  [Text] The British Government seems at last to have 
realised that it must reinforce its troops in Bosnia. The 
welcome change of attitude was reflected in yesterday's more 
positive statements by John Major and Malcolm Rifkind. Instead 
of looking for a way out of Bosnia they now convey the 
impression, albeit only half convincingly, that they are seeking 
a way in by pressing others to join them in sending more troops. 
  The change has not been voluntary or happy, and it does not 
yet extend to sending troops unilaterally, but it shows that the 
Government is slowly facing reality. At home it would face 
bitter recriminations if it were to leave a successful British 
general in the lurch and British soldiers so vulnerable and 
thinly stretched. 
  Internationally, it would have a lot of explaining to do if, 
after such a string of failures and misjudgements, it missed the 
fragile window of opportunity for peace that has now opened up 
in Bosnia. It may not be enthusiastic but at least it is doing 
the right thing. 
  The fighting continues but cease-fires are holding in 
several 
areas and may gradually be extended. The combatants are weary 
and the intervention of the Americans and Russians has increased 
pressure on them to settle. There is a chance that military 
stability can open the way for diplomacy to end the war. 
  The window will not stay open long. The Muslims still want 
the return of conquered areas and have been emboldened by 
American support. The Serbs have periodically offered partial 
withdrawals but not enough to satisfy the Muslims. So the 
temptation to resume fighting as soon as the spring arrives 
remains strong. It is therefore important to put in more UN 
troops quickly to police the cease-fire lines. 
  There is also another reason for speed. At the moment the 
Russians are using their influence on the Serbs to promote a 
settlement. Indeed, they have reportedly been quite firm. But 
Moscow is so politically unstable that it cannot be relied on to 
remain in this frame of mind indefinitely. Now is the time to 
make the most of Russian co-operation. 
  In these circumstances it is foolish to pretend, as the 
Americans do, that there is a clear distinction between 
peace-making and peacekeeping. If the Americans were to 
acknowledge this and send in their own troops, the chances of 
peace would be enormously enhanced. 
  Unfortunately the troubled Clinton administration lacks the 
courage to take this step, so others will have to face much 
higher risks. But if they also duck the challenge, the costs 
and risks will eventually be higher still.

<F P=106> [Report by Philip Webster: "I Shall Fight on as Leader, </F>
Says Major"] 
  [Text] John Major tried yesterday to head off the threat 
of a summer leadership crisis by making plain that he will stay 
on as Prime Minister even if the Conservatives are badly beaten 
in the European elections in June. 
  Dismissing renewed speculation about a leadership challenge, 
Mr Major declared: "I was elected at the last election with the 
largest vote any party or party leader has ever had. I was 
elected to remain Prime Minister of this country at least until 
the next election, and beyond it if I win the next election." 
  He moved to strengthen his personal position as he and 
Douglas Hurd launched an attempt to unite Conservatives on 
Europe in the run-up to the June 9 elections. The Foreign 
Secretary is chairing a committee drawing up the manifesto and 
his delicate task will be to bind together the Eurosceptic and 
enthusiast wings of the party. 
  The two ministers indicated yesterday that they intended to 
do that by concentrating on trying to curb the growing power of 
Brussels and improving the running of the European Union [EU], 
while steering clear of such divisive issues as the single 
currency and the Union's long-term future. Mr Hurd took the 
first step last night when he told European politicians and 
bureaucrats to cut red tape and unnecessary lawmaking, crack 
down on fraud, and concentrate on making the EU work. 
  "The Union must be careful not to over-legislate," he told 
the Belgian Institute for International Affairs. "What we do, 
we should do well; what we would do badly, we should not 
attempt. The temptation for every legislator is to spend his 
time legislating. It is after all the power which our electors 
give us. It requires self-restraint and confidence to know when 
not to rush into print." 
  The EU was now doing less and doing it better, but in some 
areas it was still doing too much and not well enough. "There 
is a danger that we legislate to feel good, not to do good," Mr 
Hurd said. "Nowhere is this truer than in social legislation. 
The warm glow comes quickly after passing a piece of law which 
is designed to raise standards for those in jobs; the chill of 
lost jobs because of lost competitiveness is felt more slowly." 
  Mr Hurd also urged the Community to crack down on fraud, 
which he said was a drug that weakened Europe. Nobody knew how 
much money was disappearing, but the catalogue of crime was 
depressing: double payments of subsidies, cattle smuggling to 
avoid customs levies, social fund cash being used to build 
private villas. 
  Both Mr Hurd and the Prime Minister, in a [BBC] Radio 2 
interview earlier, pledged to fight any attempts to weaken the 
right of individual governments to veto European legislation 
against their national interest when the EU expands. 
  Mr Major told Jimmy Young that he intended to fight the 
elections on a "distinctly British Conservative manifesto for 
the future of Europe," and he tried to scotch suggestions that 
he could be threatened if the Tories did badly. His approach 
pleased close colleagues, who believe that pressure on the Prime 
Minister will ease if the Tories can hang on to 20 of their 
existing 32 seats. But the difficulty of the task of uniting the 
party on Europe was underlined by Sir Edward Heath, who 
criticised Mr Hurd's speech and said ministers had to be more 
positive about the Union. 
  Asked about a potential challenge and support for Michael 
Heseltine, Mr Major said that similar rumours had circulated 
last year but a challenge had failed to materialise. "It is an 
extremely good story for a small number of journalists to 
pursue, but it is not real." 
  He also rejected much of the criticism against him and 
denied 
being weak and indecisive. "If that were really true, I doubt 
that I would have survived the last three-and-a-half years. 
Some people think you should shout and scream and bang the 
table to show you are a strong leader. That is not in my 
nature." 
  Mr Young said strong leaders could survive hatred and 
vitriol, but said: "Once people begin to laugh at you and make 
fun of you, and draw silly cartoons of you, with your shirt 
tucked in your underpants, is it almost impossible to regain 
your credibility?" The Prime Minister replied: "That has been 
going on for quite a long time. It hasn't in any way changed 
the way in which I seek to run the Government. The thing that 
matters is what emerges at the end of the struggles, not what 
vitriol may be hurled during that time." 
  Mr Major also denied that the Government was "riddled with 
sleaze," saying: "Rumours and innuendo do not make fact. There 
has been a frenzy, but I know the Conservative Party, and it 
isn't the case."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Threadbare Over Europe"] </F>
  [Text] Exciting things were happening in Brussels 
yesterday. Austria, Finland and Sweden having agreed membership 
terms last week, the pressure from foreign ministers of the 
European Union [EU] was on Norway to overcome its remaining 
objections. As those difficult negotiations continued, Poland's 
foreign minister joined Hungary's in announcing that his 
government would shortly be applying for membership of the EU. 
  Set beside these stirring events, Douglas Hurd's speech in 
the Belgian capital was that of a European minimalist. True, 
the Foreign Secretary made plenty of valid points. The EU must 
be careful not to over-legislate and must keep the principle of 
subsidiarity in the foreground: pretty rich advice from a 
Government that is not only strong on legislation but happy to 
usurp the role of local government. There was much emphasis on 
strict financial controls and the prevention of fraud; and, 
finally, a not-so-ringing conclusion that true European vision 
in 1994 lies in having a truce on rhetoric, making a success of 
what has already been agreed, and extending that success to 
other parts of Europe. 
  The explanation for Mr Hurd's approach is simple. He was 
engaged in the impossible task of sustaining Britain's place "at 
the heart of Europe" while placating the right wing of the 
Conservative Party, a circle that cannot be squared. What he 
said was intended to sound constructive, yet at the same time 
sternly critical. Above all, it was an implicit attack on those 
who maintain that the EU must be constantly adapting its role 
and its institutions as the world changes around it. 
  Coming as it did at a moment when future change was the 
topic 
of the hour, his argument seemed politically wrong in tone as 
well as intellectually threadbare. When the union is facing 
enlargement to 15 or 16 members, and coming to terms with the 
importance of admitting East European applicants earlier than 
previously envisaged, there is little logic in suggesting that 
consolidation and good management are the top priority. 
  If Mr Hurd's speech, coupled with Michael Heseltine's recent 
attack on "Euro-sclerosis," provide an accurate sample of the 
Conservative platform for elections to the European Parliament 
in June, the omens for Tory candidates are not good. Once again 
the party will be seen to be cool towards the EU's institutional 
framework. The result is likely to be not just lost seats but 
-- to Continental eyes at least -- a further distancing of the 
Government itself from the whole European enterprise. 
  That kind of marginalisation weakens Britain's voice within 
the EU, and so diminishes this country's perceived weight in the 
eyes of the world -- and especially in the United States and 
Japan. If John Major genuinely wishes Britain to achieve its 
full diplomatic potential within the councils of Europe, he must 
decide which is more important: Britain's clout in the world, 
or appeasing the Europhobe wing of his party.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with UK Chancellor Kenneth Clarke by </F>
Donald Macintyre; place and date not given] 
  [Text] It is all still in place. The infectious laugh, 
the cigar -- a little bigger perhaps than it used to be -- and 
the engaging tease at his own expense. Kenneth Clarke's famous 
remark, for example, that the Conservative Party would stick to 
manifesto promises but not necessarily to speeches made on a 
"wet night in Dudley" has, he says, "gone down very badly in 
Dudley." 
  Something has changed, however, though it probably has more 
to do with the office than the man. This most famously candid 
of politicians now measures his words just a little more 
carefully. He plays, in the classic manner of Chancellors, a 
straight bat on when taxes might start to come down, and on what 
will happen next to interest rates. 
  Yes, he says, he has "heard the rumours" that he initially 
disagreed with Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, 
over the last cut in interest rates -- which is as near as he 
will come to confirming that the Bank resisted a cut and they 
ended up compromising about 0.25 per cent. 
  Despite this, he insists, he is already thinking of other 
ways of extending the arm's-length relationship with the Bank, 
which already publishes its inflation forecasts unfettered by 
the old-style Treasury censorship and which now unilaterally 
fixes the timing, though not the content, of rates. No, he is 
not ready to share with the Independent what those ideas are. 
And on independence of the central bank, he will follow past 
practice and "give his candid views when I stop being 
Chancellor." 
  On the, for some, burning question of whether that might 
come sooner rather than later as a result of a leadership 
crisis, he makes no effort to disguise that his hat remains in 
the ring if and when the moment comes at a time of Mr Major's 
own choosing. But if the party is serious about getting out of 
what he has called its "dreadful hole," it needs to unite behind 
its leader. 
  He adds with mild irritation: "Speculation is always fun, 
but we have now reached the stage where there are about three or 
four members of the Cabinet who cannot make a remark about the 
weather without it being interpreted as a leadership bid." 
  Most of all, of course, political recovery from the "hole" 
is 
about the economic recovery. About which he is "more confident 
now than I was at the time of the Budget, that we are going to 
have a sustained recovery with low inflation." On the other 
hand, he insists he has always been cautious about the way he 
puts this; but if he makes the "right decisions" and if British 
industry remains competitive, "then we are on to several good 
years." 
  So when we can expect taxes to come down again? "I think 
people would be cynical about tax-cutting that appeared to be 
solely determined by the political timetable.... I do not 
propose to cut taxes before we have recovery or before we have 
healthier public finances. I think the objective of strong, 
sustained economic growth has to override everything else." 
  What if public spending undershot this year as it did last 
-- 
would he simply use it to reduce borrowing further, or would he 
consider cutting taxes as soon as this November? He warns: "It 
will require several years of tight public spending control in 
order to hit the very ambitious target I have set for us of 
getting back to break-even in the medium term." So is he ruling 
out November 1994 tax cuts? "I will do what I did last year 
which is to refuse to speculate about what I might and might not 
do in November.... I might take people by surprise again." 
  Last week, Mr Clarke took a broad swing at excessive 
salaries 
at the top of industry. But that does not mean he is thinking 
about increasing the top rate of tax. The man earning 35,000 
pounds, he explains, is also on the top rate of tax. "I am not 
going to put up the tax on the 35,000-pounds-a-year man because 
he and I are annoyed about some particularly exceptional 
chairman of a big company. I remember Nigel Lawson had disorder 
in the Commons when in the Budget he took the top rate of tax 
down. It was hard won and I do not intend to give it up easily. 
Low marginal rates of taxation are very important in producing 
a highly competitive economy." 
  Nor is he holding out much early prospect of broadening the 
VAT base -- something he has always favoured, in principle. The 
Government has just had a major controversy, he points out, over 
VAT on fuel, rescued by his compensation package. "I think if 
we were starting again we would have a much broader base with 
VAT, but all Budgets start from where we are now and I will make 
decisions about tax base according to the needs at the time...so 
women with small feet can continue to have VAT-free shoes for 
the foreseeable future." 
  This all sounds very much the programme of a politically 
and economically prudent Chancellor. Where he perhaps differs 
from his predecessors is in the role he sees for the Treasury 
within government. It is not, he insists, just a matter of 
saying no to "everything you can turn down." Control of public 
spending under the new system devised by Norman Lamont is based 
on "choices of priorities." He is pleased that cuts last year 
were matched by increases in health and education. 
  "Since John Major came in we are developing a more 
collective 
way of running the government and that means the Treasury 
presides over the spending round. But I try to ensure that as a 
Cabinet we steer the money in ways that match policy.... I 
regard the Treasury, the DTI, the Department of Employment, as 
the three economic departments and I think the Treasury should 
have a positive input into what I call supply-side economics. 
And we should look at the consequences for business and the 
real economy in the changes we make." 
  That sounds fine in theory. But has the Government not 
failed the first big test of that -- the initiative for 
injecting private finance into public sector infrastructure? 
  No, insists the Chancellor. The Government's opponents are 
complaining, only four months after he set up a panel to take 
the private finance drive forward, "that we have not got any new 
railway lines yet." 
  "By the end of this Parliament we will have a different way 
of investing in infrastructure in this country with much greater 
use of private sector capital rather than the taxpayers' money." 
Today he launches the British paper for the G7 jobs summit in 
Detroit, convened by President Clinton -- an opportunity to 
reinforce Britain's case within Europe for a deregulated labour 
market. "We need to set an agenda for growth of an 
employment-creating kind. That means you do have free-market 
economics, low inflation, healthy public finances without big 
government debts. It means creating a climate for enterprise 
and risk investment, encouraging small and medium-sized 
businesses. You have to deregulate...which means getting rid of 
outdated laws on trades union recognition, restricting workers' 
hours, paternity leave and minimum wages -- all the clutter that 
is on the European statute book." 
  On Europe, he denied any Cabinet split. "The thing is, we 
are in favour of it; we are in favour of a free-market, open 
trading Europe.... We are against protectionism, 
over-centralisation, over-regulation. If only people would look 
at how that separates us from the Labour and the Liberal 
parties." 
  He said the politicians would be "foolish" if they ignored 
the fact a gap had opened up between European politicians and 
public. Conservative MPs would find it easy to agree on a policy 
opposing centralisation and over-regulation. "Today's argument 
is what sort of European Union is going to be. I want to see 
British Conservatives at the heart of the European Union arguing 
with considerable ferocity for the kind of Union we want." 
  He has already all but ruled out a return to ERM [exchange 
rate mechanism] in this Parliament. What about this century? 
The argument over the ERM, he says, would only come back after 
achieving a reasonable level of economic convergence. "We have 
all got to have achieved low inflation, healthy public finances 
and sustainable economic growth. When the big players are all 
in that same position, we will find that the markets will give 
us reasonably stable exchange rates, which I still regard as a 
very desirable objective. 
  ``Only then is it worth talking about whether you need any 
system to reinforce the markets to give you that stability of 
exchange rate.''

<F P=106> [Article by John Biffen: "Nothing To Lose in Europe"] </F>
  [Text] Douglas Hurd has collected a small team of 
relatively anonymous middle-ranking politicians and apparatchiks 
to mastermind the forthcoming European elections. I have heard 
few senior politicians complain that they have been excluded 
from this inner council. This electoral contest is a thankless 
challenge, fraught with risk. 
  The European election for British members of the Strasbourg 
Parliament will be fought on three broad issues. First, there 
will be a powerful media element determined to convert the 
occasion into a personal trial of strength for John Major. His 
qualities will not become a doorstep issue, but bad results will 
be used by his media opponents to persuade those at Westminster 
whose loyalty is brittle that a change of leader is essential. 
The pundits will argue that heavy Tory losses provide the last 
available pretext for change ahead of the autumn double of a 
party conference and a new parliamentary session. In my view, a 
change is highly improbable, but Mr Hurd dare not discount it. 
  Secondly, the Opposition will try to turn the European 
contest into a nationwide by-election. That is what European 
elections have been in the past. In current circumstances, this 
could be devastating for the Government. At the last European 
elections, Labour led the Conservatives by 40 percent to 35 
percent. The current poll rating gives comparable figures of 
around 50 per cent and 25-30 percent, indicating a swing to 
Labour of nearly 10 percent. Furthermore, the Liberal Democrats 
are now poised to do significantly better than in their 
freakishly bad showing four years ago, when they were eclipsed 
by the momentary splendour of the Greens. 
  The Opposition is determined to convert the forthcoming 
Strasbourg elections into a national by-election for three 
reasons. Such a strategy would concentrate the debate on 
domestic economic and welfare issues, which give the Tories such 
a miserable poll rating. Second it would demonstrate the 
ability of the Liberal Democrats to gather tactical Labour votes 
and to storm hitherto safe Conservative seats. Furthermore, it 
would excuse the Opposition from having to argue their own 
ill-formulated European policy. Douglas Hurd needs no guidance 
on the implications of this. 
  Finally there is the option of emphasising the European 
character of the election, and, as far as possible, wrenching it 
from the national mould. This seems to be the obvious Tory 
tactic. Even so, I suspect that some of Mr Hurd's associates 
would argue for a low-key European campaign, since this would 
minimise the risk of exposing Tory divisions. 
  This "hold your nose and think of Europe" approach should be 
disregarded. It will take a monumental effort to introduce 
European Union issues into the June election, but domestic Tory 
interests, and wider considerations, require a high-profile 
campaign. This means, in the first instance, that the European 
election should be only incidentally about the Strasbourg 
Parliament. Its activities, powers and procedures are 
unfamiliar. The Tory link with the declining European People's 
Party, agreed by Margaret Thatcher, is best left to history. 
There are wider European issues to put to the British public, 
and they cover not only British government policies agreed 
through the Council of Ministers, but also our prospective 
attitudes to the Maastricht renegotiation scheduled for 1996. 
  The June election will be an excellent opportunity for the 
Government to look ahead and share its vision. A broader 
European campaign could proceed under the terms set out by John 
Major in The Economist last September. He then emphasised the 
need to look afresh at how the European Union is developing: 
"...it is time to look afresh at the Community and consider the 
way ahead. Time to put away the old slogans, dreams and 
prejudice." 
  At the centre of the changing Union is its enlargement -- 
almost certain -- from 12 to 16 members and probably upwards of 
20 thereafter. Enlargement may imply tighter monetary controls 
and Commission power, as Jacques Delors would argue, or it may 
result in a looser form of Union foreseen by the terms 
negotiated for Britain at Maastricht, with "opt-outs" in respect 
of the social chapter and monetary union. 
  There is also public interest in how subsidiarity can be 
used 
to reduce the burden of the common agricultural policy. People 
want to know how the burgeoning bureaucracy of the Union can be 
reduced, and how Britain's freedom from the social chapter can 
be maintained. 
  There is the opportunity for the Government to gamble on a 
high-profile European election, which involves setting out its 
post-Maastricht negotiating stall. Of course it involves the 
risk of an open argument about opinions honestly held, but then 
what are elections about? With a dismal poll rating, the Tories 
can afford the risk of offering the politics of choice and not 
those of passing domestic discontent.

<F P=106> [Speech by Environment Minister David Curry at the </F>
South-East Regional Transport Strategy Conference on 7 March: 
"Transport Policy Must Be Environmentally Sustainable"] 
  [Text] "In our sustainable development strategy we set out 
the approach we are taking to sustainable land use. We are 
seeking to integrate land use planning into an overall strategy 
that contributes to both environmental and economic objectives, 
one that includes both transport and the environment. 
  ``To allow us to do this we must have a framework for 
transport decisions that will allow us to meet the environmental 
objectives. The chief measures within that framework are pricing 
to reflect the full costs of travel, and careful land-use 
planning to help us to reduce the need for that travel in the 
first place. 
``Our planning policies will be taken forward in the new 
Planning Policy Guidance Note 13 : Transport, which we have 
produced with the Department of Transport and the Welsh Office. 
The draft, on which we received over 800 supportive and 
constructive comments, set out clearly how local planning 
authorities can reduce the need for travel in the first place 
and provide people with a choice of means of travel. 
  ``We are looking to publish the final version of the 
guidance 
note very shortly. Without pre-empting what it will say, the 
key issues must be: 

  -  maintaining and, where cost effective, 
improving strategic communication within the South-East and 
between the South-East, the rest of the UK and continental 
Europe; 
  -  reducing and managing the pressures of congestion and 
its impacts on the local urban environment; 
  -  providing for a 
better relationship between home, workplace and other activities 
to reduce the need to travel; 
  -  encouraging more efficient 
transport choices and enabling people to walk, cycle or catch 
public transport; and 
  -  improving the environment. 
  ``This is not an issue that we in the UK are tackling alone; 
it is one which is being tackled all over Europe. There are no 
ready answers, and there are difficult choices to be made, but 
they are choices which we will make together to produce a 
transport planning policy that meets all the aims of 
sustainability.''

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F>
"Proposals for a New Policy Framework for Control of Hazardous 
Chemicals"] 
  [Text] Environment Minister Robert Atkins today welcomed 
the publication of a discussion document outlining proposals for 
a new framework for the assessment and control of hazardous 
substances. 
  Announcing the publication of the Discussion Paper, Mr 
Atkins 
said: 
  "The paper seeks to develop a transparent and coherent 
strategy for identifying and controlling chemicals which are 
particularly dangerous to the environment, especially those 
released from diffuse sources. The proposed strategy is based on 
internationally accepted criteria for assessing the risks to 
human health and the environment and advocates a measured 
approach to the control of these risks. 
  ``Our objective is to build upon existing programmes and 
measures, so that we remain consistent in our approach and 
minimise the burdens on the public sector and industry. 
  ``The proposed new policy framework is a response to the 
challenges the Government established in the UK Strategy for 
Sustainable Development. It also aims to meet two objectives of 
the Governments deregulation initiative - greater clarity in the 
operation of environmental regulations and the consideration of 
viable alternatives to regulatory action which maintain existing 
environmental standards.'' 
<H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>
  The Discussion Paper - Reducing Emissions of Hazardous 
Chemicals to the Environment was released today for public 
consultation. Its publication fulfils a commitment made in the 
Sustainable Development Strategy. 
  The paper describes a new policy framework for reducing 
diffuse emissions of hazardous substances to the environment. It 
consists of a discussion paper supported by several annexes. 
  The discussion paper considers components of the proposed 
new 
framework in a stepwise manner beginning with criteria for 
identifying environmentally hazardous chemicals. The proposed 
criteria are intended to be consistent with those used in other 
UK substance based policy initiatives. This is followed by an 
outline of the principles of Risk Assessment; a vital component 
of the proposed strategy designed to inform decisions as to the 
extent of risk posed by a particular chemical and the degree of 
control necessary to manage the risk effectively. The paper then 
discusses a proposed hierarchy of measures to control chemical 
risks. Alternatives to regulatory control are considered 
including voluntary agreements with industry and economic 
instruments. 
  The supporting annexes provide detailed information on 
typical point and diffuse sources of emissions of hazardous 
chemicals and many of the existing control measures including 
international initiatives such as the Montreal Protocol and the 
Oslo and Paris Conventions. Technical guidance on priority 
setting and risk characterisation for hazardous chemicals is 
also provided. 
  The Government is seeking responses to the proposed strategy 
and related issues by the 31st May 1994.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- After the temporary failure of the 
European Union's [EU] membership negotiations with Norway, FRG 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party) is 
optimistic that an agreement can still be reached. "We must not 
give up now but continue to negotiate," he said in Bonn on 
Wednesday [9 February]. The remaining problems can be overcome 
and can be solved. The continuing negotiations should link up 
with a new meeting of the European Union's Council of Ministers 
on 15 March.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Social Democratic Party [SPD] 
calls the failure of the membership negotiations with Norway a 
"disgrace" for the governments of the European Union. The 
inflexible attitude by Spain and Britain toward Norway calls the 
already concluded agreements with Austria, Finland, and Sweden 
into question again, Deputy SPD Chairwoman Heidi Wieczorek-Zeul 
said in Bonn on Wednesday. The negotiations in Brussels have 
shown how necessary a reform of the Europan institutions is "at 
the head and at the limbs," if an expanded European Union wants 
to remain capable of acting.

Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) 
expressed concern about the wave of arrests in China. He called 
on the government in Beijing to release the representatives of 
the democracy movement, as the Foreign Ministry reported. In 
addition, the Ministry announced that the Chinese Government had 
been "approached" on this matter already last week. The arrests 
could "clearly disturb" German-Chinese relations, it was said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Before the ban of the Workers Party 
of Kurdistan, PKK, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations 
(BKA) did not request any information or documents on PKK 
associations from the Turkish Directorate General of Security. 
Nor was there a promise to Turkey to put an end to the party's 
activities in Germany, states the government response to a 
parliamentary inquiry of the Party of Democratic Socialism, 
which was published on Tuesday [8 March]. 
  Even though Turkey had "repeatedly expressed" the desire for 
a PKK ban in Germany since the mid-1980's, the measure ordered 
by FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic 
Union) on 26 Noveber 1993 was "not" implemented "upon the desire 
or request of other governments." The ban was based 
"exclusively on German laws as well as on the principles of 
necessity and reasonableness," the government response stresses.

  [Text] Prague March 7 (CTK) -- "I would not speak of 
stagnation in Czech-German relations. However their development 
in many fields does not meet our mutual expectations," German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel says in an interview published in 
the economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on Monday [7 March]. 
  Kinkel stresses the need to realise that along with claims 
for compensation by Czech victims of Nazism there at the same 
time exist claims of Sudeten Germans expelled from 
Czechoslovakia after World War Two. Kinkel says that Germany is 
aware of its responsibility towards Czech victims of Nazism. 
"We will seek to find an appropriate solution," he says. 
  "We are watching with interest steps by the Czech Government 
concerning partial compensation for Nazi victims. But there 
should not be any prejudices and a dialogue should be carried 
out with Sudeten Germans," Kinkel says. "Results of the 
German-Czech commission of historians which recently published a 
report on its symposium on `Germans, Czechs and Slovaks during 
the First Republic' should be taken into consideration much more 
than before, which would help make the discussion a 
`matter-of-fact' one," Kinkel says. 
  Kinkel expresses satisfaction concerning German-Czech 
economic relations. "In the economic field, Germany, with a 
roughly 25- percent share in both imports and exports, is 
unambiguously the most important partner of the Czech Republic," 
he says. "We have opened our market to Czech goods. Thousands 
of Czechs have found jobs in Germany, and especially in border 
regions. Millions of German tourists visit the Czech Republic. 
By this we are considerably contributing to economic and social 
stability in the Czech Republic," he adds. Besides, the Czech 
economy "has absorbed a considerable portion of German 
investments oriented towards Central European countries," he 
said. 
  On the future of Europe, Kinkel voices the conviction that 
"excessive regulation and centralism" within the European Union 
has to be moderated. However, the goals of the Union will 
remain unchanged. On the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, 
Kinkel says the approach by the EU, NATO and the United Nations 
Security Council clearly shows the "firmness with which the 
international community reacts to the Bosnian war." 
  "To achieve a functioning security system in Europe it is 
important that different institutions -- the EU, the Conference 
of Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), NATO and Western 
European Union (WEU) -- join together, Kinkel says, adding that 
Germany supports such countries as the Czech Republic in their 
efforts to approach the structures of European and 
trans-Atlantic security.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- FRG Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany) has come out in favor 
of more intensive economic and political presence by Germany in 
Asia. However, a precondition for that is better access to the 
markets in the region, Rexrodt will say at the traditional "East 
Asian Love Feast" of the East Asian Association in Hamburg on 
Friday [4 March] evening, according to the prereleased script of 
his speech. Asian products have almost unlimited access to the 
German and the European markets. "We wish for similarly good and 
fair conditions in Asia," the minister will say. 
  Thus, foreign trade in particular is to be promoted, but 
also 
cooperation in the fields of science and technology, 
environment, development, education, and culture. Trade and 
industry are to be supported more intensively in their efforts 
by the German trade chambers on site, the Federal Office for 
Foreign Trade Information, and the German embassies. Already, 
10 trade delegations or chambers are operating in the 
Asian-Pacific area. Other representations in Shanghai and 
Guangzou (China) are being planned. Hermes export guarantees 
and federal loan guarantees are to be issued in greater numbers 
to ensure direct investments. At the end of 1993 these 
investment guarantees in this region amounted to 1.8 billion 
German marks.

  [Text] Waidhaus, Germany March 4 (CTK) -- Trade and 
Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy agreed here today with the 
Bavarian Economy Minister Otto Wiesheu that the National 
Property Fund (FNM) would provide a guarantee for uninsurable 
damages to the oil pipeline that will run from Ingolstadt, 
Bavaria to Nelahozeves, Central Bohemia. 
  The FNM will deposit the guarantee of 80 million Deutchmarks 
with the Czech National Bank for the whole period of existence 
of the pipeline, stated Wiesheu. 
  Dlouhy said that the FNM was happy to do so because of the 
significant amount of interest that it would receive from the 
deposit. 
  He added that if the FNM ceased to exist while the pipeline 
was still in operation, the state would take over the guarantee. 
The pipeline is expected to operate for 20 to 25 years. 
  Dlouhy expects the guarantee from the Bavarian side to come 
from the Bavarian Government or a state organisation. 
  "In the case of terrorist attack, each side would cover half 
the damage. If there is war or revolution, both sides have the 
right to withdraw from the agreement," stressed Dlouhy. 
  Details of the agreement will be worked out by a group of 
experts on March 14, according to Wiesheu. The agreement should 
be ready for signing by the end of March. 
  The Bavarian Government has prepared legislation enabling 
construction of the pipeline to go ahead, which the Bavarian 
parliament is expected to approve in April. It was necessary to 
resolve the issue of the guarantee against damages resulting 
from acts of God before the legislation could be passed. 
  Construction of the pipeline began on the Czech side last 
September, and will begin in Germany this spring. The project 
should be completed in 1995.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the future, Germany and Estonia 
want to cooperate closely in combating organized crime, 
terrorism, and other crimes. A corresponding agreement was 
signed by Eduard Lintner (Christian Social Union), parliamentary 
state secretary in the FRG Interior Ministry, and Estonian 
Interior Minister Heike Arike in Bonn on 7 March. The foci of 
joint police investigations are to be, among other things, 
drug-related crimes, forged money, and the smuggling of people, 
as well as money laundering, the smuggling of stolen cars, and 
arms trade. 
  Lintner stressed the need for ever closer police cooperation 
with the countries in East Europe and the successor states of 
the Soviet Union. The FRG has categorized them in three 
"rings," depending on their geographic location. After the 
conclusion of agreements with Poland, the Czech Republic, the 
Slovak Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria, the treaty with Latvia 
[as received] is the first one with a country of the second 
"ring," to which, in addition to the Baltic states, Russia, 
Belarus, and Ukraine are counted. Agreements are also planned 
with the Central Asian, formerly Soviet, republics as the third 
"ring," Lintner said. "Gratifying beginnings" already exist, in 
particular with Uzbekistan, he noted.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has submitted 
proposals to the three former Western allies for bidding 
farewell to their troop contingents in Berlin. Government 
spokesman Dieter Vogel told this to journalists in Bonn on 
Tuesday [8 March]. For this reason, the ambassadors of France, 
Great Britain, and the United States were received in the 
chancellor's office for an exchange of information last Friday. 
  The departure is planned for September. The last contingent 
of Russian troops is to be bidden farewell already in August. 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will 
be present at the ceremony. 
  According to Vogel, on Tuesday the Cabinet adopted the 
German-Russian treaty on mutual disaster relief, which was 
signed by Kohl in Moscow already in December 1992, and passed 
the annual disarmament report to Parliament. This report by the 
Foreign Ministry deals with Europe's political efforts for 
disarmament and arms control. The Ministry intends to comment 
on the contents in the next few days.

  [Text] Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic 
Party) has said that the figures published by the Federal 
Statistical Office have confirmed the government's economic 
expectations. It is now "more than mere hope" that housing 
construction and exports will contribute to a recovery of the 
economy. A decline of the inflation rate below 3 percent in the 
course of the year is also "within reach." Rexrodt demanded 
that the "path of moderate wage settlements and of the 
consolidation of the budget should be continued." This would 
make possible further interest rate reductions.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The FRG Economics Ministry is in 
favor of clearly reducing wages for relatively unskilled work 
and improving them with subsidies from unemployment insurance or 
other social benefits. This proposal was made by Economics 
State Secretary Johannes Eekhoff in Bonn on Tuesday [9 March] 
with a view to the employment conference of the seven leading 
industrial states [G-7] in Detroit on 14-15 March. 
  Eekhoff, who is preparing the conference for the German 
side, 
pointed to experiences in the United States. Unemployment 
benefits there are only 35 percent of the previous salary and is 
paid for only half a year. This exerts massive pressure on the 
unemployed to accept any job that pays less. "We do not want 
that," Eekhoff said. However, in Germany, too, one must have a 
more sensible combination of lower wages and social benefits. 
This need not necessarily be a citizen's money [Buergergeld], 
which unites all social benefits. 
  Eekhoff does not expect any specific decisions from the 
conference of the economics, finance, and labor ministers of the 
G-7 countries United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, 
Italy,and Canada in Detroit. There will not be a joint 
communique. The point is to learn from each other. Thus, the 
conference can provide stimuli for a new dynamism for growth and 
employment, he said. 
  For the German side it is interesting to hear how the United 
States has created many jobs over the past years despite a 
relatively low growth and why unemployment in Japan is still 
relatively low in international comparison. Germany has been 
asked for a report about dual vocational training, which is seen 
as a reason for the relatively low youth unemployment in Germany. 
  The G-7 conference is to be opened with a speech by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, who suggested the conference at the G-7 
economic summit in Tokyo in summer 1993. Then there follow five 
two-hour rounds of talks of the ministers about all aspects of 
the labor market crisis, from tax polity to technology issues to 
wage policy. These topics are also to be discussed further at 
the next economic summit in Naples in July.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- At the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday [8 
March] Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported Finance Minister Theo 
Waigel (Christian Social Union) and called on the individual 
ministers to exercise thrift in drawing up the 1995 federal 
budget. The draft budget for next year will, however, 
"certainly no be adopted by parliament before the Bundestag 
elections (16 October)," government spokesman Dieter Vogel 
announced after the Cabinet meeting. 
  However, the Federal Government will stick to the usual 
dates 
and pass the draft budget in the Cabinet at the end of June. 
The basis are the overall economic basic data, which have to be 
presented this April, and the next tax estimate in May. 
  Vogel added: "The Cabinet is aware of the fact that extreme 
thrift in budget policy and in the demands of the individual 
ministries is necessary also for 1995." The chancellor did "not 
leave any doubt" as to this necessity. The Cabinet members 
"will take this into account when working out their plans for 
1995," Vogel said.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- On Wednesday [9 March], the 
German Bundesbank continued its policy of lowering interest 
rates in tiny steps. The banks were allocated 83 billion German 
marks [DM] within the framework of security transactions under 
repurchase agreement. The marginal allocation rate was 5.94 
percent and thus 0.03 percentage points below the interest rates 
of the security transactions under repurchase agreement last 
week. Until then the important "third prime rate" had been 7 
percent. 
  According to the Bundesbank, the allocations were given an 
interest rate of 5.94 to 5.95 percent. The allocation volume of 
DM83 billion is set off by expiring transactions of DM82.5 
billion. The latest security transactions under repurchase 
agreement were, like the ones last week, an interest tender, in 
which the banks contribute their own ideas concerning the 
interest rate at which they want to use the money for a duration 
of 14 days. 
  At the Frankfurt banking center the new tiny step was 
interpreted as a signal that the guardians of the currency want 
to keep to their course of lowering interest rates, which they 
have announced for 1994. "The Bundesbank has decided not to do 
nothing," it was said. In view of the enormous expansion of the 
money supply in January and the latest turbulence on the 
international financial markets, a major decline in the prime 
rate cannot be expected for the foreseeable future.

  [Text] Wiesbaden (DPA) -- In 1993, the economic performance 
in eastern Germany measured by the GDP rose by 7.1 percent in 
real terms compared with the year before. Thus, the economic 
growth in the new laender and in the former East Berlin was 0.8 
percentage points above the preliminary value published in 
January. This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office 
in Wiesbaden on Wednesday [9 March]. During the second half of 
1993, the GDP rose by 7.4 percent compared with the second half 
of 1992. During this period it amounted to about 149 billion 
German marks. As a result, eastern Germany has a share of 9.2 
percent in the overall German economic performance.

  [Text] Cologne -- Under the current circumstances, the 
European Monetary Union (EMU) would be a "one-man-show." 
According to the Institute of the German Economy (IW, Cologne), 
in 1993 only Luxembourg fulfilled all the criteria for 
membership. The other 11 states of the European Union [EU] 
would, however, not have managed to get into the EMU club. This 
is the result of a comparative study the IW presented in Cologne 
on Wednesday [9 March]. The main stumbling block was high 
national debts: All EU countries except Luxembourg were further 
from the target figures than ever before. The Monetary Union is 
to come into force in 1996, or 1998 at the latest. 
  According to the IW, Germany failed to meet two of the 
criteria in 1993. The inflation rate of 4.3 percent and the 
public household deficit of 4.2 percent of the GNP exceeded the 
permitted figures. The deviations are, however, not very high, 
which should make it possible for Germany to meet the criteria 
by 1996. The high inflation rate is mainly due to the 
development of prices in eastern Germany, which was influenced 
by special factors. 
  The IW says that in addition to Germany, six other EU 
countries -- Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Ireland, 
and the Netherlands -- stand a comparatively good chance of 
fulfilling the entry criteria by 1998 at the latest. Greece, 
Italy, Portugal, and -- apart from remaining slightly under the 
permitted debt level -- Spain failed to fulfill any of the 
requirements in 1993.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Social Democratic Party politician 
Hans Gottfried Bernrath has harshly criticized the reform of the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA) planned by FRG 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union). 
"I cannot imagine that in case of police operations a 
leadership team, some sort of executive committee, would be able 
to react quickly and with responsibility," the chairman of the 
Bundestag Internal Affairs Committee said on Monday [7 March] in 
an interview with Saarland Radio. 
  Bernrath criticized the steps taken by Kanther as a result 
of 
the failed antiterrorist operation in Bad Kleinen as 
"half-hearted measures." They consist of "personnel questions 
and not organizational tasks." If the minister is of the 
opinion that BKA chief Hans-Ludwig Zachert is not able to 
fulfill his task, Zachert must be replaced. It is "certainly 
not correct" for the ministry to have greater influence on the 
BKA either, because the ministry is "even more tangled than the 
BKA and its structure is even less manageable." 
  In his 46-page final report on Bad Kleinen, which became 
known to DPA at the weekend, Kanther lists many mistakes 
committed by the security forces. In an interview with 
SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG he also announced that he will include 
Zachert in a BKA "leadership characterized by teamwork" and 
intensify the ministry's influence on this authority. For 
reasons of civil service law, the 56-year-old official cannot be 
transferred. 
  During the operation in Bad Kleinen, a small town in 
Mecklenburg, more than eight months ago, Wolfgang Grams, a 
suspected terrorist of the Red Army Faction (RAF), as well as a 
GSG-9 man were shot dead. Kanther's final report affirms that 
the judiciary assumes that Grams committed suicide. His 
companion, suspected RAF terrorist Birgit Hogefeld, was arrested. 
  In the meantime, experts have obviously come to a new 
assessment of the terrorist group: "The RAF no longer exists as 
one single entity," Norbert Wingerter of the Bavarian Office for 
the Protection of the Constitution writes in the technical 
journal MAGAZINE FOR ECONOMICS, CRIME, AND SECURITY [Zeitschrift 
fuer Wirtschaft, Kriminalitaet und Sicherheit]. He is the head 
of the "Extremism/Terrorism Assessment" Department and 
summarizes his views: RAF command, arrested terrorists, and 
sympathizers are profoundly split, in particular regarding the 
issue of armed operations.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- After the setbacks suffered by the 
Christian Social Union [CSU] in a number of local elections in 
Bavaria, party leaders have been assessing the election results 
of Sunday [6 March] with restraint. "This is neither a 
landslide nor a political shift," CSU Chairman Theo Waigel said 
on Monday before a meeting of his party's Executive Committee in 
Munich. Minister President Edmund Stoiber spoke of a "pretty 
middling result." Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen, on the other hand, claimed 
that the CSU had suffered a serious defeat: "The voters have 
given the CSU strong slaps in the face." 
  Waigel assessed the average turnout of 60 to 70 percent as 
"good to very good." This shows that one cannot speak at all of 
the citizens' abstinence at the polls if such efforts are made, 
he said. The result of the mayoral elections in Bamberg was 
considered to be the biggest surprise of the election, in which 
about 400,000 of the approximately 8.6 million people eligible 
to vote in the Free State were involved. In Bamberg there will 
be a run-off ballot without Rudolf Grafberger, the current mayor 
and CSU candidate. 
  The SPD mayors, on the other hand, held their positions in 
the towns of Bayreuth, Hof/Saale, Rothenburg/Tauber, as well as 
Aschaffenburg in Franken. In addition to Bamberg, a run-off 
election for mayor is necessary in Eichstaett, Freising, and 
Landsberg/Lech in Upper Bavaria, as well as in Lindau in Swabia. 
The local council elections in the Lower Franken district of 
Rhoen-Grabfeld as well as in the Upper Bavarian district of 
Ebersberg were won by the CSU. 
  In Bamberg, the CSU had expected a better result, Waigel 
said. The decision will now be made on 20 March between Herbert 
Lauer of the Supraparty Association of Voters and Andreas Starke 
of the SPD. Waigel called for support for Lauer as the CSU's 
originally desired candidate at the run-off ballot. Stoiber 
warned against seeing local elections as a barometer of the mood 
for Landtag or Bundestag elections. The decisions are too much 
related to specific individuals, and party affiliation plays 
only a small role. 
  Verheugen spoke of a "political earthquake." For his party 
the "brilliant results" achieved in the towns and communities, 
which are worried about jobs, are a confirmation of its policy. 
In the view of Bavaria's Greens' leader Gerald Haefner, the CSU 
is clearly losing its grass roots. The election result of 
Sunday is a "gratifying sign that the CSU's power is no longer 
God-given." The good results achieved by his party in several 
communities show that many people no longer see ecology and the 
economy as contradictions, Haefner stated.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to FRG Interior Minister 
Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union), the new asylum 
law, which has been in force since last July, has "decisively 
changed" the situation of asylum-seekers in Germany, At the 
same time, the new regulation has contributed to the 
preservation of internal peace in the FRG by having a 
"satisfying" effect "toward the inside and a clarifying" effect 
"toward the outside," Kanther stated on Wednesday [9 March] 
while presenting the first official balance sheet of the new 
asylum law. 
  In the report on recent experiences, which he presented to 
the Bundestag's Internal Affairs Committee, Kanther primarily 
pointed to the decline in the number of asylum-seekers last 
year: It went down from 224,000 during the first six months to 
98,500 during the second half of the year, thus experiencing a 
decline of 56 percent. The situation has clearly improved, 
particularly in the communities, the minister said. At the end 
of the year, one out of four beds in many reception facilities 
were no longer occupied, and it was possible to close many 
communal accommodations.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The Berlin police has stated that a 
report, according to which the authorities are preparing for a 
"hot and bloody spring" in the capital city, is "pure 
panic-mongering." There are "indications and individual 
statements from the left-wing extremist and right-wing extremist 
camps concerning planned disturbances," Police President Hagen 
Saberschinsky said on Tuesday [8 March]. However, the 
responsible state protection department of the police does not 
know anything about an analysis by the Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution about an "escalation of violence." 
  Referring to a confidential analysis by the Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, today's edition of the daily DIE 
WELT reports that Berlin is facing an escalation of violence. 
According to the paper, the authorities fear an increase in the 
number of political murders. Riots are expected in particular 
during the international soccer match between Germany and Great 
Britain on 20 April, Adolf Hitler's birthday. 
  The Office for the Protection of the Constitution did not 
confirm the newspaper report, either. Its spokesman, Eberhard 
Kruschke, told DPA that no "specific plans" for disturbing the 
soccer match are known. It is still too early to analyze the 
situation. Office for the Protection of the Constitution and 
police stressed that they are in close contact. The police will 
"do everything so that extremists from the left and the right do 
not have a chance in the city," Saberschinsky stressed. 
  According to DIE WELT, the leftist autonomous scene in 
Berlin 
considers the holding of the soccer match "on the Fuehrer's 
birthday, in the stadium built by the Fuehrer, in the capital of 
the Fuehrer's Reich" as a provocation. At first the match was 
supposed to take place in Hamburg, but then it was canceled for 
fear of riots. Subsequently, the Berlin Senat declared its 
readiness to have the soccer match take place on the Spree 
river. The number of violence-prone autonomous activists is 
estimated at 5,000 all over the country. The stronghold is 
Berlin, where more than 1,000 people belong to this scene.

  [Excerpts] Paris, March 8 (BTA) -- Today Bulgarian 
President Zhelyu Zhelev had working breakfast with Mr. Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the Union pour la Democratie 
Francaise. In the course of an hour the two politicians 
discussed the changes in East Europe and Bulgaria after their 
previous meeting four years ago. Dr. Zhelev arrived here 
yesterday to attend the UNESCO commemoration of the 51st 
anniversary of the saving of the Bulgarian Jews. 
  The analysis of the ways in which France and the Western 
democracies could assist economic reform in Bulgaria and help it 
overcome the negative consequences of the Yugo-embargo and the 
Yugo-crisis revealed the decisive importance of foreign 
investment, access to Western markets and modern infrastructure. 
  Bulgaria's policy in the Balkans and in respect to the 
different ethnic and religious groups in this country was 
assessed as worthy of respect and meeting European standards and 
principles. Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he believed France's 
parliament would soon ratify Bulgaria's Europe agreement. Mr. 
Giscard d'Estaing also believes that French private capital is 
now experiencing an upsurge and may take leading positions in 
East European markets and industry. 
  More than 300 representatives of France's political elite, 
academic and business circles responded to the invitation of the 
French Institute of International Relations and gathered at the 
French Automobile Club to hear President Zhelev's lecture and to 
ask him questions about Bulgaria's foreign investment 
regulations and its economic and foreign policy. 
  In his lecture, titled "Bulgaria Today," Dr. Zhelev focused 
on the present state of this country's economy, the prospects 
for its future development and the possibilities it provides for 
foreign investment. 
  For Bulgaria there is no alternative to intensive structural 
adjustment of the economy, President Zhelev said. Foreign 
investment, modern infrastructure and access to foreign markets 
are of decisive importance for this country today. Dr. Zhelev 
described foreign capital as the most important factor for this 
country's economic progress against the background of 
consumption and accumulation slump, export shrinkage and 
production stagnation. Though foreign investment alone would not 
solve these problems, without such investment all solutions 
would be incomplete from the technological point of view, said 
the President. 
  Dr. Zhelev recalled Bulgaria's liberal investment 
regulations, guaranteed by this country's Constitution and laws. 
The low price of labour in Bulgaria, its well-trained and 
highly qualified work force and traditionally strong positions 
on the markets of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East 
and its geographical location at the crossroads between the East 
and the West are among Bulgaria's other advantages, according to 
Dr. Zhelev. But despite all this Bulgaria is still regarded by 
foreign business as a relatively high risk country, he said. 
  President Zhelev listed the negative consequences of the war 
in the former Yugoslavia for Bulgaria. One of them is fear to 
invest which foreign investors mechanically transfer to 
countries neighbouring on the former Yugoslavia. [passage 
omitted] 
  Without expecting streams of foreign capital, we are 
convinced that investment in this country will mark a 
considerable growth this and next year, the President said, 
citing the recently signed standby agreement with the IMF and 
the forthcoming agreement with the London Club, the stepping up 
of privatization in this country and the expected change in the 
business climate and economic recovery. Bulgaria is a good 
place to invest today, President Zhelev concluded. 
  Information on Bulgaria's radical economic reforms and on 
possible ways to encourage foreign trade and foreign investment 
was met with great interest. Prospects for Bulgaria's 
participation in European and regional economic structures were 
also under discussion. 
  Asked to comment on the "comeback" of Russian diplomacy to 
Europe through the crisis in Bosnia, Dr Zhelev said he was 
pleased with the unity of action between Russia and NATO to end 
fighting in Bosnia. He expressed hope that it is the prototype 
of future cooperation in the interests of European security. 
The NATO ultimatum had decisive impact; its success was largely 
the result of France's firm principled stance and its active 
commitment to international peacekeeping efforts, Dr. Zhelev 
said. [passage omitted] 
  Participants in the discussion drew the conclusion that the 
orientation of Bulgaria's foreign policy to integration into the 
European and Euro-Atlantic structures is distinct and clear-cut 
and receives broad support from Bulgarian institutions and 
society.

<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F>
Sergio Luciano in Milan; date not given: "I Am Not the Sheriff 
of Nottingham" -- first paragraph is LA STAMPA introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- "Those who say I want to take from the poor 
and give to the rich, and who compare me to the Sheriff of 
Nottingham, are lying. By continuing to twist the facts, the 
only thing they are demonstrating is that they want to continue 
to lie and defame." Silvio Berlusconi personally is entering 
the field in the tax battle: "The first point in our program is 
dedicated to the poor. They will be exempt from paying income 
tax." 
  [Luciano] But Budget Minister Spaventa says you would make 
the Treasury go "broke".... 
  [Berlusconi] [Forza Italia economic expert] Antonio Martino 
will give Spaventa a detailed response tomorrow and counter his 
thesis. Moreover, our program is very clear in this respect. 
  [Luciano] Many say that it is summed up in the slogan "less 
taxes." 
  [Berlusconi] Far from this. This statement could not be 
farther from the truth, given the fact that we are developing a 
45-point program and supplying a series of concrete responses to 
the various problems. No party has presented such a precise, 
articulated, and detailed program during an election campaign. 
  [Luciano] Do you really envisage safeguarding only high 
incomes? 
  [Berlusconi] First, we propose eliminating income taxes for 
poor families. Then, there is the introduction of deductions 
for each dependent. The third and fundamental point, is to 
reduce VAT [value-added tax] to 2 percent and reduce the number 
of taxes to 10 or a maximum of 20, compared to the current 200. 
  [Luciano] Will the Treasury lose resources? 
  [Berlusconi] According to our calculations, these 
modifications to the current system will introduce more justice 
without drawing from the revenues of the Treasury. 
  [Luciano] But the progressives are also saying that public 
spending cannot be reduced. 
  [Berlusconi] They forget that for years they accused the 
government in office of having wasted public money. If it was 
really impossible to spend money better, the progressives would 
fall into a clear contradiction. 
  [Luciano] You must admit, however, that the 18 million lire 
a 
year for four people is a little.... 
  [Berlusconi] This was how Martino answered those asking him 
what he considered to be the minimum subsistence level for a 
family of four in Rome today. It is certainly not the objective 
identified in our government program which is complex and 
systematic and cannot be read only in some points and ignored in 
others. 
  [Luciano] The impression that remains is this: less taxes 
and 
no sacrifices. 
  [Berlusconi] This impression is entirely mistaken. The key 
point of our program is that of relaunching economic development 
by relaunching private enterprise and containing where possible 
public expenditure, which has exploded out of control over the 
past years and which has consequently deprived the economic 
system of the savings necessary for development. 
  [Luciano] What are your basic proposals then? 
  [Berlusconi] Doing all that is possible to take up the path 
toward development. The program contains a detailed account of 
many measures in this respect. For example, placing a limit on 
public spending by reducing the tendency to increase public 
spending by at least one point, in such a way as to bring the 
expenditure to 43 percent of GDP in the medium term as in 1980. 
This must be combined with a reform and a cultural revolution 
in the public administration to transform today's perfect 
bureaucratic and political machine that creates difficulties and 
bans into a support for those that work and produce. 
  [Luciano] What role will you leave to the state? 
  [Berlusconi] The state must go back to doing its job. Not 
the 
job of the private sector. When done by the private sector, 
everything that the state does costs half and is normally done 
better. For this reason and in order to work toward a reduction 
in public expenditure, we propose that the state return to 
fulfilling its fundamental duties, leaving to private initiative 
all that the private sector can produce in a system of 
competition: health, education, retirement benefits. But to 
protect myself from malevolent and unfounded criticism, I must 
say that the briefness of an interview does bad service to the 
completeness, organization, and precision of our program. I 
really hope that our critics will want to examine directly each 
of our proposals in the program before making any hasty 
judgements.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mancino Denies Sisde `Silence'"] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 5 Mar (ANSA) -- Interior Minister Nicola 
Mancino today again denied the charge contained in the 
Parliamentary Secret Commission's report on the Sisde scandal, 
he did not tell the Commission about the discovery of a 14 
billion lire slush fund until a criminal probe started making 
headlines. 
  Quizzed on Italian radio as to the findings of Commission 
Chairman Ugo Pecchioli, Mancino said: "I did not keep silent. 
When the (embezzled) funds were returned thanks to the work of 
a magistrate, I considered it a correct operation, and there is 
no obligation to report a correct operation. Subsequently, no 
one informed me when a judicial inquiry began. I read it in the 
papers like the Rt. Honourable Pecchioli, so we were in the same 
position". 
  Mancino also reiterated the view that even if he had known 
of 
the probe and informed the Commission, he would have exposed 
himself to charges of breaking judicial secrecy. 
  "If I had known of the preventive detention measures and had 
spoken to the Secret Service Commission, notwithstanding the 
fact that that Commission is bound to secrecy and in particular 
to state secrecy, no one would have spared me the accusation of 
violating a judicial secret," he said. 
  In a separate issue related to the Sisde probe, Electoral 
Reform Minister Leopoldo Elia today rejected the contention that 
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro should step down after the March 
27-28 elections to defend himself from charges of pocketing 
Sisde cheques like other interior ministers before and after him. 
  Elia stressed that the much-debated statement from Rome 
prosecutors on Thursday [3 March] had cleared Scalfaro of all 
imputations against him, "just as it would have done for a 
normal citizen." 
  He also pointed out that the Italian Constitution "lays down 
a much stronger bond of continuity for the president than for 
government or Parliament." 
  Scalfaro's term of office is due to end in 1999. Some 
political forces, notably the Northern League, have indicated 
they will press for his resignation if they win the elections.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Sees No Change in Future </F>
Economic Policy"] 
  [Text] Naples, 7 Mar (ANSA) -- The next government will 
have no choice but to follow the same path and seek the same 
objectives as the current executive in matters of economic 
policy, even if differences can exist on the tools to achieve 
the same objectives, Italian Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said 
here on Monday [7 March]. 
  Speaking at the presentation of next July's summit here of 
the West's group of seven most industrialised countries (G-7), 
Ciampi also paid attention to last week's turbulence on 
international markets and observed that it had been "an 
excessive reaction" to the American decision to slightly 
increase short-term interest rates. The long-time Bank of Italy 
governor added how the same criteria for rates did not apply to 
both Europe and the United States. 
  Turning his attention to Italy's trade balance, premier 
Ciampi forecast how it will improve this year even over the 13 
trillion lire (7.7 billion dollars) assets posted for 1993. 
  He also down-played the reduced tax revenue reported last 
week, stating how the difference between forecast and intake had 
been modest and determined by a dip in the gross domestic 
product.

  [Text] Milan, 8 Mar (ANSA) -- Silvio Berlusconi and his Go 
Italy [Forza Italia] movement are favored by a relative majority 
of artisans and small- and medium-sized activity businessmen, 
followed by Mario Segni and his Pact for Italy, according to a 
poll to be published in the next edition of the "SRL" magazine, 
to be distributed with the economic daily ITALIA OGGI. 
  The poll showed how Berlusconi won the support of 32 percent 
of those interviewed, followed by Segni with 24.5 percent and 
the People's Party [Italian Popular Party], the ex-Christian 
Democrats, with 12.9 percent and liberals with 8 percent, while 
the Northern League was favored by only 6 percent of those 
quizzed and the rightists of National Alliance, headed by the 
neo-fascist MSI, came in at 2.5 percent. 
  The poll also asked sector organizations to list the 
priorities and coming in first was a rationalization of the 
taxation system for businesses, a general reduction in labor 
costs and greater flexibility for hiring and firing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy's Trade Balance in Red Outside </F>
European Union"] 
  [Text] Rome, 5 Mar (ANSA) -- Italy's trade balance with 
countries outside the European Union dipped into the red in 
January, a month which is traditionally bad for Italian trade, 
while over all exports rose 13.1 percent against a 4.5 percent 
increase in imports, according to the national statistics bureau 
ISTAT [Central Statistics Institute]. 
  Last January, Italian exports outside the European Union 
totaled 8.864 trillion lire (5.26 million dollars), while 
imports were valued at 9.056 trillion lire (5.374 billion 
dollars). 
  On a sector-by-sector basis, transport means showed the 
worst 
performance with a 34-percent plunge in exports. ISTAT noted, 
however, that by excluding ship sales there was actually a 19 
percent increase in sale abroad. 
  The following table, expressed in billion European lira, 
with 
one dollar worth 1,685 lire Friday [4 March], compares Italy's 
exports to various areas of the world in 1993 and 1994:

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Prodi, Privatization, a Light State"] </F>
  [Text] Bologna, 2 Mar (ANSA) -- Italy has proved it is 
serious about privatizing public sector enterprises -- but that 
doesn't mean that state will not continue to play a 
"fundamental" role, said IRI [Institute for Industrial 
Reconstruction] Chairman Romano Prodi, in a lecture at the 
university here. 
  "We have to learn to take care of the state -- and even to 
love it a little -- because if we lose track of society's 
progress as a whole, business will suffer too," said Professor 
Prodi, an economist who teaches at Bologna when not busy with 
public sector affairs, in a talk entitled "State and Market in a 
Changing Italy," held at the University of Bologna main lecture 
hall. 
  "The modern state was born of the conviction there was a 
leading role to play in assuring citizens certain essential 
functions," said Prodi. "I would never attempt to dismantle 
that conception of the state because it would be like destroying 
our roots, it would encourage disintegration and we would be 
committing those errors that today, we see the United States 
trying to remedy," he said. 
  "For years the international business community scoffed at 
us, they were convinced Italy would never carry out 
privatizations," said Prodi, who has just finished supervising 
the successful transfer to public company of one of Italy's 
largest commercial banks, Comit [Italian Commercial Bank], 
following quickly on the sale of Credito Italiano and IMI 
[Italian Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property]. 
  But privatization is a process that "cannot be interrupted, 
even after the elections, because people are lining up to buy 
the shares and the politicians can see that," he said. 
Privatization helps to restructure public finance "but above 
all it creates economic pluralism and thus supports political 
democracy," he continued, but "we have to make these companies 
grow, not create conglomerates with them." 
  "If in the place of a public sector monopoly we go on to 
create a private sector monopoly, then I must say I preferred 
the public sector one," he added. 
  In a lecture one listener said it sounded like "a speech by 
an aspiring prime minister," ("if that's what one is aiming, one 
is generally more cautious," shot back Prodi) the IRI chairman 
underlined that the long and sometimes torturous process of 
privatizing Italy's public sector industries and services did 
not imply the state would not continue to play a "fundamental" 
role in Italian affairs. 
  Italy needs a public sector "with a light structure, but 
that 
remains responsive," because it is "unthinkable that the state 
be absent from its role in the life of the country," he said. 
  While reducing tax pressure is a goal, said Prodi, it is not 
something than can happen in several months or several years. 
"The goal is not to avoid taxes, but to have an intelligent, 
light state," he said. 
  Prodi also commented on the Italian television market, 
recalling an old professor of his and his lessons on anti-trust 
rules. 
  "He used to say that the mass media was a chapter all by 
itself, and that the law had to be more stringent in relation to 
it. First, it was important to fix market quotas to make sure 
they weren't excessive, secondly, to pay particular attention to 
the interface between media ownership and general economic power 
overall," Prodi said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "High Court Rules Bribes, Mafia </F>
Profits, Not Taxable"] 
  [Text] Rome, 8 Mar (ANSA) -- Wealth earned from theft, 
extortion, corruption, fraud, contraband, drug traffic and other 
mafia operations cannot be taxed, ruled the combined penal 
sections of Italy's high court of appeals, the Cassation Court, 
Tuesday [8 March]. 
  Illicit profits and gains cannot be considered earnings and 
are subject to confiscation, but not taxation, decided the court 
in a ruling on a case filed by the Naples prosecutors office in 
November that involved a street seller of pirated tape 
recordings. 
  The question had divided judicial opinion "in the absence of 
any precise position by the legislature," the ruling stated, 
with penal experts expressing the view the fruits of crime 
cannot be taxed, while the civil section held it was appropriate 
to levy taxes on all unreported income. 
  Today's ruling thus provides a precedent jurists had been 
seeking, both for those courts dealing with underworld economic 
activities as well as for judges dealing with the extensive 
flows of bribes and kickbacks that has been unveiled in 
anti-corruption investigations in the past two years. 
  The high court ruled that illegal activities "go against the 
public interest protected by the constitution" and that they 
would be legitimated if recognized as a normal tax source. 
  Further, the Cassation Court argued, those who commit crimes 
such as theft, larceny, fraud, corruption, mafia association, 
drug traffic and the laundering of illicit funds are already 
subject to financial and penal sanctions that include: liability 
to restore sums stolen and for payment of damages, and 
court-ordered confiscation of property. 
  These existing measures, which aim to subtract all illegal 
gains and profits from their holders, would thus be at odds with 
a measure like taxation, which would recover only a part of 
those illegal funds, the court decided.

business owners think last summer's hard-fought cost of labor 
agreement should be a model for other Group of Seven countries 
fighting unemployment, and are asking the government to say so 
at the upcoming G-7 summit in Detroit. 
  Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], 
the manufacturer's association, and the three major trade 
federations CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL 
[Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and UIL [Italian 
Federation of Trade Unions], met today with Prime Minister 
Ciampi, Treasury Minister Piero Barucci and Labor Minister Gino 
Giugni in preparation for that international meeting on 
employment scheduled for March 14-15. 
  "We think last July's agreement should be highlighted as a 
model for a bargaining agreement that involves labor, management 
and the government," said Confindustria director general 
Innocenzo Cipolletta. 
  Cipolletta, who attended today's meeting along with the vice 
president of the association Carlo Callieri, asked the 
government to urge the G-7 to focus on the following issues: 
stimulation of demand, development policy, training policy, and 
a more flexible labor market. 
  Antonio Lettieri, in charge of international relations for 
CGIL, the largest of Italy's three trade union federations, 
asked the government to press for "the introduction of a `social 
clause' in international trade accords that would provide a 
floor of protection for workers rights" in those G-7 talks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Two Judges Detained on </F>
Camorra-Linked Charges"] 
  [Text] Naples, 7 Mar (ANSA) -- Two judges were amongst 17 
people receiving arrest warrants Monday [7 March], after a year 
of investigations into links between politicians, the judiciary, 
and the Campania region's Camorra mob, official sources said. 
  Ending up behind bars Monday were Armando Cono Lancuba, a 
former public prosecutor in Naples who has since been moved to 
Melfi, and Vito Masi, a Naples Appeals Court judge. Cono 
Lancuba is charged with Camorra criminal association, while Masi 
is charged with corruption. 
  Naples judges also issued warrants informing 10 people that 
they are under investigation, and sought permission from the 
Lower House to arrest Giuseppe Demitry, a Socialist deputy, and 
Alfonso Martucci of the Liberal Party. 
  Arrested in this morning's swoop was Alfredo Bargi, a 
well-known Naples lawyer and candidate with the Pact for Italy 
party in the March 27-28 general elections. 
  Receiving advisory warrants were Assistant Public Prosecutor 
Arcibaldo Miller, who heads an investigation into health service 
kickbacks, and Raffaele Sapienza, a judge in Santa Maria Capua 
Vetere near Naples and a candidate with the Forza Italia party. 
  All the legal figures involved are suspected of rigging 
Camorra trials to ensure light sentences or acquittals for 
mobsters in the dock. 
  Investigators have been at work on the case for a year, 
helped along by Camorra boss-turned-state's evidence Pasquale 
Galasso, and some twenty lesser grasses. The recent decision by 
key boss Carmine Alfieri, believed to head one of southern 
Italy's biggest crime empires, to collaborate with justice, 
allowed investigators to corroborate some of Galasso's stories. 
  Galasso, well-informed sources recalled today, has told 
judges of "a solid link between politicians wielding great 
power, influential magistrates such as Lancuba, known Camorra 
bosses such as Alfieri and Galasso himself, sectors of the 
Naples journalistic world, and wheeler-dealers and entrepreneurs 
of all types." 
  Of the 17 arrest warrants issued today nine have been 
served. 
  Today's arrest of two judges brings to four the number of 
Italian magistrates behind bars charged with rigging organised 
crime trials, with some 30 more around the country under 
investigation for suspected complicity with Mafia-style groups. 
  These include Corrado Carnevale, the former president of the 
first section of the supreme Cassation court who earned himself 
the nickname of "sentence-killer" for overturning Mafia 
sentences on formal quibbles. 
  In a statement issued later Monday evening, Naples' Chief 
Prosecutor Antonio Cordova deplored information leaks which 
could jeopardise "extremely delicate investigations." Cordova 
was particularly irked by disclosures that his assistant 
Arcibaldo Miller, who heads key investigations into Naples' 
kickback scandals, had received an advisory warrant. This 
warrant is sent to inform people that they are being 
investigated in connection with a crime. It does not imply that 
an arrest warrant is on the way. 
  "This office," said Cordova in his statement, "can only 
imagine that the spread of this news is likely to cast serious 
shadows over the enquiry into the Naples `tangentopoli' [bribe 
city] just at a point in time when it has entered its most 
important point, allowing the system of political-institutional 
corruption to be rooted out and overturned thanks to the 
extraordinary commitment of that group of colleagues which 
Miller coordinates and will continue to coordinate."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on interview with Estonian President </F>
Meri: "Estonia's Path of Renewal"] 
  [Text] Estonia's President Lennart Meri, who visited the 
Basel trade fair, is optimistic about domestic development in 
his country. He said that the small republic is successfully 
pursuing the path of renewal in spite of numerous problems. 
Meri's assessment of the relationship with Russia, whose 
current circumstance the West does not understand very well, is 
more pessimistic. 
  In President Lennart Meri's view, Estonia has overcome the 
worst. This not only means decades of Soviet rule but also the 
first two years after regaining independence in 1991. Estonia 
was completely dependent on the Soviet Union with regard to fuel 
supplies and to market its products, and it was subject to the 
division of labor ordered by Moscow. "This went so far as bolts 
being produced in our country, but not the nuts to go with 
them." Liberating themselves from this embrace was difficult 
for Estonians until they introduced their own currency. As long 
as it was still part of the ruble zone, Estonia was affected by 
the adverse situation in the collapsed empire. "In late 1991 
and early 1992, there were queues in front of our shops the 
likes of which we had not seen in the worst Soviet times." 
<H5>  Optimism, Courage, Public Spirit </H5>
  Yet, the president says that Estonian voices grieving for 
the 
Soviet Republic of Estonia have never existed. Such feelings 
may have existed among the Russians in Estonia; this part of the 
population felt as if it had been expelled from paradise. 
Meanwhile, however, even the Russians in Estonia discovered the 
advantages of the market economy; they appreciate that good work 
is remunerated with proper pay, that one can do one's shopping 
in Tallinn, or Helsinki, or Basel. Of course, this is a 
question of money, and of course, the people of Estonia are 
still poor. "I, as the head of state, have a salary that 
amounts to less than your minimum wage here in Switzerland." 
According to Meri, the Estonian economy went through its lowest 
point in 1993. Exports to the former Soviet area (which used to 
be 95 percent) are under 20 percent now. 
  What creates more problems than the modernization of 
industry 
is agriculture. First, because of the slow pace of 
reprivatization, "which we want to conduct as justly as 
possible," and because of the greater need for subsidies of 
agricultural enterprises in the northern climate. 
  Meri says that the most precious capital the country has is 
the courage and idealism of its people. The people know what is 
important and they are prepared to overcome the difficult 
transition period. Estonia is shown solidarity, including 
efficient help, mainly from neighboring Finland, with which it 
also shares a similar language. The Estonian government has 
concluded a number of free trade agreements, including one with 
Switzerland, and there are 5,000 joint ventures in existence in 
the country. The president regrets that the share of Swiss 
companies in these joint ventures is a very small one. He added 
that his country is trying to speed up Baltic cooperation; the 
free trade zone of the three republics will come into effect at 
the beginning of April, and a common economic area will also be 
of greater interest to foreign investors. The states in the 
Baltic area will have to stand together in economic and security 
questions. "We will not repeat the mistake of 1939/40 when each 
of us faced the Soviet threat alone." 
<H5>  The Shadow of Big Brother </H5>
  In the midst of the new awakening, which also caused culture 
to flourish, the Russian neighbors were almost completely 
forgotten for a while, said Meri. Only during the last few 
months has the public come to realize that developments in 
Russia continue to be of importance for the Baltic States. At 
the beginning of the year, President Yeltsin assured Meri that 
Russia would keep its promise to withdraw its troops by 31 
August 1994. Then there was a hardening in negotiations, and a 
"high-ranking figure" at the Moscow Foreign Ministry publicly 
says that the Baltic States joined the Soviet Union of their own 
free will in 1940. Why now, and what is the purpose, Meri asks 
-- and leaves the answer open. Does he see enough Western 
support for the Balts? The reply is evasive, but clearly 
skeptical: The small Baltic States are hardly taken account of 
-- in the majority of the world press -- politicians think of 
the next elections, historic perspectives are unknown to them. 
<H5>  Everything Open in Russia </H5>
  Meri considers the situation in Russia unstable, but he 
thinks that everything is still open; the journey might lead to 
democracy or back to the old conditions. The West does not 
really understand this. Does the Estonian president see any 
possibility of making concessions in the treatment of Russian 
minorities in his country, which might improve relations with 
Moscow? Meri denies this. He thinks that Russia uses the 
minority question as an excuse and a lever and that the relevant 
Estonian laws are generous. "If this is not the case, we will 
gladly step up the protection of minorities -- provided that the 
great Western democracies set a good example."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock </F>
by Ilse Oberhofer in Vienna -- live] 
  [Text] [Oberhofer] Good morning, Mr. Mock. 
  [Mock] Good morning. 
  [Oberhofer] We felt very bad about calling you so early. We 
know that you came back from Brussels at 2 o'clock this morning. 
  [Mock] No problem. 
  [Oberhofer] Thank you. Your comment is important for us. 
Things do not seem to be going well in Brussels at the moment. 
You and State Secretary Ederer came back early this morning 
without having achieved anything. Together with Sweden and 
Finland, you were supposed to confirm officially and formally 
the results achieved last week. This was not possible because 
two other issues are still unresolved in Brussels. There are 
claims that, if it is not possible to achieve agreement with 
Norway, and if agreement cannot be reached in the discussion 
about the blocking minority, the entire schedule of the European 
Union might be in danger, and there might be problems concerning 
Austrian membership in the European Union on 1 January 1995. 
How do you assess the situation? 
  [Mock] Everything is open at the moment. Talks with the 
three countries Sweden, Finland, and Austria have basically been 
concluded. Thus, the only thing that was still missing was the 
official confirmation and explanations concerning the wording of 
the agreements. This has also been settled. The Norwegian 
issue is still unresolved. Since negotiations always took place 
on a bilateral basis, one can assume that our agreements might 
be forwarded to the European Parliament, despite the suspension 
of talks with Norway. However, the European Union must first 
settle an internal issue -- the question concerning the blocking 
minority. Today [Greek Foreign Minister Theodhoros] Pangalos, 
the president of the Council of Ministers, will meet with the 
president of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Then we 
will see how things go. 
  [Oberhofer] Does this mean that we could go ahead without 
Norway, but that the question of the blocking minority might be 
crucial. When Austria negotiated with Brussels, was it possible 
to foresee that this blocking minority might play such a big 
role? There was never any mention of this problem. 
  [Mock] Since this question had been unsettled for a very 
long time, everybody assumed that it would be resolved within a 
week. Yet this was not the case. 
  [Oberhofer] You seem to believe that there are still major 
difficulties ahead, that there is the possibility of a failure 
to reach agreement. Talks on the blocking minority have not 
only been postponed, but apparently they have been terminated. 
  [Mock] Political contacts are naturally taking place all the 
time. Thus, negotiations have not really been terminated. 
There are no official talks at the moment. The question now 
has to be settled what the European Parliament can do, and what 
is possible on the basis of the standing orders. This will be 
discussed today. 
  [Oberhofer] Well, what is possible on the basis of the 
standing orders? There have been contradictory statements in 
this respect. Some officials claimed that a regulation is 
required by 10 March, some mentioned 4 May. Generally, one has 
the impression that the European institutions are rather 
inflexible. 
  [Mock] I would say that, basically, this might happen in 
every parliament. If the groups represented there reach 
agreement, the standing orders can be handled in a relatively 
flexible way. If they fail to achieve agreement, they have to 
adhere closely to the standing orders. The same applies to the 
European Parliament, which is much younger and does not have the 
required experience. 
  [Oberhofer] Mr. Mock, is the impression correct that there 
are currents in the European Union that are not really 
interested in an enlargement of the community? 
  [Mock] This became apparent during the negotiations, and 
it is one of the reasons why the talks were so tough. The 
acceptance of new states was not a foregone conclusion. Some 
members of the European Union are asking themselves whether the 
union should be enlarged or not. However, the three countries 
finally achieved a positive result. In the current difficult 
situation, other factors are decisive -- that is, the fourth 
applicant and, above all, an issue that must be settled 
internally. The question is whether the European Parliament can 
immediately start consultations and conclude them by the 
beginning of May, prior to elections on 12 June, or whether this 
is not possible. 
  [Oberhofer] Is is not frustrating for you, that, after the 
enormous pressure under which you had to negotiate -- you 
personally did not sleep for days -- things are now stagnating? 
  [Mock] Well, the situation is certainly not pleasant. Yet 
one must always take a certain risk. 
  [Oberhofer] Mr. Mock, are you still hoping that things will 
develop faster than one might expect at this point? Are you 
still optimistic? 
  [Mock] I believe that we have achieved the most difficult 
part. I hope that everything else will also be resolved on a 
timely basis. Basically, I am optimistic. 
  [Oberhofer] Do you have to wait until you are called back to 
Brussels to ratify and sign documents? 
  [Mock] We will certainly receive news today. 
  [Oberhofer] Mr. Mock, thank you very much for the interview. 
Good bye. 
  [Mock] Good bye.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Did State Police Official Spy for </F>
Terrorists in Libya?"] 
  [Text] The Hochenbichler case is escalating: What did the 
high-ranking State Police official have to do with the Libyan 
intelligence service and the East German "Commercial 
Coordination Empire?" 
  Hochenbichler, who is seriously ill [with cancer of the 
throat], still denies that he spied for a GDR embassy secretary. 
However, Interior Ministry investigators speak of a "dense 
network of evidence." Investigations are now extending to 
Libya. Hochenbichler reportedly had close contacts with a 
Libyan intelligence service agent. For many years 
al-Qadhdhafi's capital of Tripoli was considered the point of 
departure for sensational attacks. This ranged from OPEC 
terrorist "Carlos" to the bombing over Lockerbie. 
  The Cologne Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution has a Stasi document in its possession. The 
document, which is labeled "top secret" and has the file number 
000898, lists Stasi measures to support Arab terrorists. A 
brief excerpt: 

  -  creation of logistical bases in the GDR 
capital with the inclusion of GDR citizens; 
  -  promotion of travel 
by liaison people of the Carlos group to the FRG and other West 
European countries; 
  -  efforts to acquire weapons, explosives, 
money, and information; 
  -  inspiration for acts of violence of 
armed struggle, including individual actions, attacks, etc. 
against the imperialist policy of the United States, the 
Zionists, and the clique around al-Sadat. 
  Contact addresses were the embassies in Yemen, in Baghdad, 
and in Tripoli. 
<H5>  Man in Vienna Became Very Interesting </H5>
  To put it clearly: All terrorist attacks organized via 
Tripoli were supported logistically by the Stasi. This makes a 
Vienna State Police official interesting for the GDR foreign 
espionage service HVA (Foreign Intelligence Collection Main 
Administration), because the most important counterespionage 
activities of western security authorities went across 
Hochenbichler's desk. 
  The investigations also get a new dimension as a result of 
the allegedly close contacts between Hochenbichler and former 
GDR Foreign Trade Minister Gerhard Beil and Rudolfine 
Steindling, a Viennese businesswoman and the trustee of the 
Communist Party of Austria. The Berlin public prosecutor's 
office thinks that both played a central role in the "Koko" 
empire (Commercial Coordination) of GDR foreign currency 
acquisitor Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski. Multidigit billion 
sums were allegedly transferred illegally to other countries via 
Koko. An arrest warrant has been issued for Steindling in 
Germany. 
  The hunted woman enjoys Hochenbichler's sympathy. After all, 
he was able to welcome "Red Fini" at his private party on his 
50th birthday in the Vienna Police Directorate. "Poor Fini," 
the official pitied her, must now "invest millions in lawyers." 
Steindling's lawyer, Dr. Harry Neubauer, cannot say what links 
Hochenbichler with the businesswoman. However, he rules out 
that Hochenbichler's name turns up in the comprehensive Koko 
trial files. 
  Beil, who is considered to be one of the architects of the 
Koko empire, is reportedly an old, intimate friend of 
Hochenbichler's. The state police official liked to boast of 
this friendship. At the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations, State Protection Department, Koko Chief 
Schalck-Golodkowski stated for the record that Beil had been an 
"unofficial employee" of the HVA "for decades." "In particular 
in Austria" he was working "unofficially."

  [Text] Britain's Royal Marines are to help train a new 
Baltic peacekeeping battalion, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind 
announced in the Commons today. 
  He disclosed that he had today formally agreed that the UK 
would contribute to the training of a Baltic joint peacekeeping 
battalion composed of contingents from Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia. 
  This was part of a phased multi-national programme of 
assistance, Mr Rifkind said at question time. 
  He added: "The UK's contribution will be led by the Royal 
Marines who will provide individual and company level training." 
  A Defence Ministry statement said the move followed a recent 
meeting at which the defence ministers of the three Baltic 
states indicated their wish to accept UK and Nordic offers of 
assistance. 
  The statement added: "The UK fully supports the Baltic 
states' intention to form a joint peacekeeping battalion and 
welcomes the prospect that, once established and trained, the 
battalion would be available for UN peacekeeping duties. 
  ``This is an important venture, both politically and 
militarily, and provides a tangible demonstration of 
outward-looking Baltic cooperation, and an opportunity to 
further consolidate and build on the excellent progress already 
made in strengthening political and military relations between 
the UK and the Baltic States.'' 
  The precise nature of assistance was now being examined by 
experts and officials would meet later this month in Copenhagen 
to agree the next stages, the statement added.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrew Griffiths: "Shrinking Royal Ordnance </F>
Search for Ally"] 
  [Text] The Royal Ordnance guns, ammunition and armoured 
vehicles business which appears set to enter a joint venture 
agreement with French state-owned arms makers, Giat, has shrunk 
by half in seven years while under the control of British 
Aerospace [BAe]. 
  Analysts said yesterday that they are not surprised that BAe 
has accelerated its search for alliances. The pressure to 
reduce costs brought on by declining defence spending has become 
more urgent following the ending last year of an agreement 
guaranteeing 80 percent of Ministry of Defence orders for 
explosives and propellants. 
  Against the background of sweeping cuts throughout the 
British Army, Royal Ordnance has found it difficult to offset 
reduced home demand with export orders, although about 40 
percent of the estimated 550m [million] pounds annual sales are 
sent abroad. 
  Last year Royal Ordnance received what is likely to be its 
last major order from the Ministry of Defence -- a 200m pound 
contract over five years to supply small-arms ammmunition, 
cannon and naval gun shells and tank training rounds. 
  Despite cuts which have reduced the workforce from 12,000 in 
1987 to 6,700, including 1,000 in Germany, the company remains 
the largest ammunition maker in Europe with estimated operating 
profits around 50m pounds. 
  It also claims to make the greatest range of ammunition in 
addition to small arms, artillery systems warheads and rocket 
motors. 
  Redundancies have been a constant feature and trade unions 
arguing for diversification into civil markets are certain that 
even without European collaboration more of the remaining 11 
sites ranging from Bridgwater to Glasgow face closure. 
  When BAe paid 190m pounds for the business there was intense 
speculation that the price did not reflect the true valuations 
of what BAe concedes still amounts to "thousands of acres" of 
land. 
  But the vacant Enfield and Waltham Abbey sites in the London 
region, which were expected to become development goldmines 
remain undeveloped although three-quarters of a 44-acre 
Blackburn fuse factory site was sold to Barratt for housing 
development. 
  Analysts say land which has been used for weapons 
manufacturing usually requires costly decontamination treatment 
before development if it is not to carry the risk of containing 
unexploded shells.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Europe Won't Go Away"] </F>
  [Text] The Foreign Secretary's speech last night to the 
Belgian Institute of International Affairs was billed in advance 
as a hard-hitting demand for curbs on the growing powers of the 
European Community. That, however, was for domestic 
consumption. The audience must have been struck by the mildness 
of both Mr Hurd's tone and his proposals. With the European 
elections rapidly approaching, nobody should be surprised by 
this apparent contradiction. The Conservatives remain as deeply 
divided over Europe as they were last summer at the height of 
the Maastricht debate. For reasons largely unconnected with 
Europe, the party faces heavy losses in the European polls. Mr 
Hurd is clearly seeking to ensure that the Tory campaign between 
now and June is not also the occasion for renewed public feuding 
within his own ranks. 
  Considering the gulf between the federalist Tory MEPs 
[members of European Parliament] and the Euro-sceptics, he faces 
a difficult task. The recent row over the avowedly federalist 
manifesto of the European People's Party, with which the British 
Conservative MEPs are allied, shows how easily the European 
issue could once more blow up in the Prime Minister's face. The 
Conservative leadership hopes to defuse it before June by 
sticking to the lowest common denominator on all things 
European, and by attacking Labour as often as possible. 
  This may get the Tories through the summer in one piece, but 
as a long-term strategy it is inadequate. The questions and 
problems of Europe will not go away. Ministers like to boast 
that the rest of the Community is coming round to the British 
way of thinking, but the evidence for this is thin. The 
Government has already been obliged to seek succour from the 
European Court to frustrate the Commission's attempt to impose a 
48-hour working week, despite our Maastricht opt-out from the 
Social Chapter. The 1996 conference that will review the 
Maastricht treaty is only two years away. The rest of the 
Community will probably use this to demand that we revive the 
Exchange Rate Mechanism, pledge ourselves to an eventual common 
currency, and allow more powers to be transferred to the 
European Parliament. 
  Before long, therefore, the Conservatives will once again 
have to consider these unwelcome issues. There is no doubt that 
the party in general is overwhelmingly Euro-sceptic, indeed if 
anything, this mood has hardened since the Maastricht debate 
last year. By fudging now, ministers may put off the day when 
they have to think seriously about Europe again, but they will 
not be able to avoid it indefinitely.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The framework conditions for 
the Bundeswehr are worse, according to Alfred Biehle, the 
Bundestag commissioner for the armed forces. This applied in 
particular to the financial framework, Biehle said, as he 
presented his annual report for 1993 to journalists in Bonn 
today. Politics had left the soldiers uncertain about how much 
money the Bundeswehr would finally have at its disposal. There 
was also still no constitutional consensus on foreign missions 
by the Bundeswehr. 
  With regard to the German UN missions in Somalia and 
Cambodia, the Christian Social Union politician added that 
"despite all the problems in the starting up period," an 
"excellent service" had been provided. Given the ever growing 
spectrum of tasks and the reductions in money, however, the 
Bundeswehr was being forced into an "involuntary balancing act." 
This had had "extremely negative" effects on the morale and the 
confidence of the soldiers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Karl-Ludwig Guenscher report: "Baltic Foreign Ministers </F>
Are Pressing for Bonn's Protection"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In consultations to be held in Bonn this 
week, the foreign ministers of the Baltic states want to issue 
an urgent warning to Kinkel, their German counterpart, against 
the danger of the new Russian foreign policy and, at the same 
time, ask Germany for support in defending the independence of 
their states against Russian hegemonic aspirations. "The German 
Government has to abandon the illusion that President Yeltsin 
and Foreign Minister Kozyrev are true angels of peace," a Baltic 
top diplomat told DIE WELT. On the contrary, the Russian 
Government is using right-wing extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's 
success in the election to again pursue aggressive world power 
policies. 
  "As far as contents and mental attitudes are concerned, 
there 
are no longer any major differences between the things that 
Zhirinovskiy wants and the policy of the government," the 
diplomat said. The Western thesis that one must help Yeltsin in 
order to prevent Zhirinovskiy starts from false assumptions. 
  In the consultations with Kinkel, the Balts want to press 
Germany to extend its "role as a lawyer, which is has played 
with great responsibility" so far, to "some kind of protection 
guarantee," and at the same time to bring Germany's influence on 
Russia to bear, in order to achieve security guarantees for the 
Baltics. Kinkel will have a good opportunity for this as early 
as during his visit to Moscow that is planned for this month, it 
was stated. 
  The diplomats were disappointed at the NATO failure to admit 
the Balts. The Partnership for Peace is too noncommittal, it 
was stated.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has called on Russia to adhere to the agreed August 
deadline for withdrawing its troops from the Baltic states. 
This was an important confidence-building measure for the 
region and for security throughout Europe, Kinkel said on 
Wednesday [9 March] at a joint news conference with his 
counterparts from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in Bonn. 
Germany did not want to take on an "official role as 
intermediary" between Russia and the Baltics, but it did want to 
"help mediate." At the same time, Kinkel reaffirmed German 
support for the efforts of the Baltic states to be accepted 
gradually into the European Union [EU] and the Atlantic defense 
alliance. 
  Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys expressed the 
expectation that the negotiations on association with the EU 
would begin in the second half of 1994 and be concluded at the 
beginning of next year. On the situation of the Russian 
minority in the Baltic states, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri 
Luik said that even foreign organizations had found no evidence 
of human rights violations. Problems arose mainly on practical 
issues concerning the integration of Russian citizens.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Minireactor for All"] </F>
  [Text] At the German boat fair in Hamburg, one Russian 
company was unusually restrained. As a subtenant of a joint 
stand, Roseco retreated to the last row in hall No. 12 and was 
not mentioned in the catalogue at all. For a good reason, as it 
now turns out: Roseco-Atom Co., Ltd from St. Petersburg wants to 
sell discreetly entire nuclear reactors. 
  "Our company," Roseco manager Venyamin Skvirskiy says in his 
office in Sestroretskaya 2 in St. Petersburg, "has permission to 
sell reactors and steam generators for submarines, warships, and 
icebreakers to other countries" -- both plans and entire 
facilities. Russian President Boris Yeltsin himself reportedly 
gave the permission -- the only condition: The use must be 
"peaceful." 
  Russian military officers fear the potential sell-out of 
their most secret drive technologies. Before Skvirskiy's trip 
to the boat fair, the Russian intelligence service told German 
authorities about alleged nuclear smuggling that is controlled 
by Skvirskiy. 
  Customs officers arrested the nuclear manager when he 
arrived 
at Kiel on the Baltic Sea ferry Anna Karenina. They did not 
find any radioactive material -- Skvirksiy was only carrying 
advertising brochures. 
  These brochures, however, were explosive: His offers include 
two reactors for icebreakers with a 70 megawatts capacity for 
$100 million. Big numbers do not frighten Skvirskiy: He 
demands $1 billion for 10 reactor units in relay, which yield 
500 megawatts together. 
  Roseco also has in its program steam generators of the new 
PCVS type -- for $930 million. Skvirskiy does not see any 
safety problems: He praises the reactor's "systems of passive 
safety," which regulates "itself in line with temperature." 
  Thomas Schulz-Jagow, Greenpeace nuclear expert in Hamburg, 
knows about negotiations already initiated between Russians and 
the Philippine Government concerning the delivery of a floating 
reactor unit. The contract has not yet been concluded, because 
the island state lacks foreign currency. 
  Schulz-Jagow says the safety standard of the facilities is 
"disastrous." In the compact reactors, there is hardly any room 
for safety technology. 
<H3>  Federal Office of Criminal Investigations: Trade in 
Missiles Soon </H3>
  In an internal paper, the BKA [Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations] notes a skyrocketing increase in illegal nuclear 
trade in Germany. In 1993, 241 cases became known, in 1992 
there were only 158. These cases included 118 "fraudulent 
offers" -- cashing in without delivery or offers of 
nonradioactive materials (in 1992 there were 59 cases). 
  Weapons-grade material (plutonium and highly enriched 
uranium) was offered but, according to the BKA, "there is no 
information that confirms that the persons making the offer are 
actually in possession of weapons-grade material." 
  For the future, the BKA fears a drastic increase in nuclear 
material, which could get into the wrong hands in the former 
USSR, "if the existing nuclear weapons are disassembled on the 
basis of the disarmament treaties." 
  The summary of the investigators: "The situation is not 
improving regarding crimes in this field."

  [Text] [FOCUS] France wants to get out of the Leuna 
refinery. Does Germany have to accept this? 
  [Rexrodt] Elf [Aquitaine] obviously wants to reduce its 
participation and throw this part at the feet of the Germans. 
We cannot accept that. Contracts must be fulfilled, 
particularly since there has been strong pressure in French 
politics. In addition, this would delay follow-up investments 
in Saxony-Anhalt and cost jobs. 
  [FOCUS] Can Germany force Elf to build the refinery? 
  [Rexrodt] We have made our position very clear to the French 
Government for weeks. The chancellor sent a letter to Prime 
Minister Balladur, but the answer was noncommittal. I do not 
want to put a strain on the German-French relationship, but we 
cannot be dealt with in this way. Elf must begin with the 
construction immediately. Then we can help to find more 
partners later on. 
  [FOCUS] What can Bonn use as a threat? 
  [Rexrodt] If the French do not build the refinery, they must 
give back Minol, and we will claim 1.5 billion German marks in 
contractual penalty. Then the French side has to see how it 
wants to include such penalties in Elf's stock exchange profile. 
Withdrawing will not work. 
  [FOCUS] Elf loses its incentive because Minol does not yield 
as much as expected. 
  [Rexrodt] In the long run, the involvement will pay off. We 
deliberately offered the beautiful bride Minol with its 
hump-back relative, the outdated refinery. If Elf had tackled 
Minol with real entrepreneurial elan, Minol would not have 
incurred such high losses either.

Achievable"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 7 March -- Despite the great expansion 
of the money supply in January (annual rate: 20.6 percent), 
Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, vice president of the German Bundesbank, 
believes that the Bundesbank will still achieve its money supply 
objective for 1994. For the fourth quarter of the year, its 
target is a 4 to 6 percent increase in the money supply compared 
to the fourth quarter of 1993. In an interview with FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE, Gaddum said a preliminary decision in this 
connection would probably be made in the coming months. For the 
longer term, the framework conditions speak for a slower 
expansion of the money supply. In this connection, Gaddum 
mentioned the less expansive financial policy, wage agreements 
that are compatible with stability, and the absence of tension 
on the foreign currency markets. "There is no reason to 
exaggerate nervousness," Gaddum said. For the Bundesbank there 
is no reason right now to abandon the monetary policy, which is 
guided by a long-term perspective, or to change its course as 
far as monetary policy is concerned.

<F P=106> ["Stue"-signed report: "BDI Launches `Research Initiative </F>
East'"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 7 March -- With the "Research Initiative 
East," the National Association of German Industries (BDI) wants 
to draw attention to innovative enterprises in the new laender. 
Its aim is to obtain additional orders for the industrial 
research capacities that still exist in eastern Germany. To 
achieve this goal, the BDI wants to integrate industrial 
research in the "Shopping Offensive New Laender" launched with 
the Trust Agency. Within the framework of this action, 90 
enterprises in the sphere of industry and trade agreed to 
clearly increase their purchases in eastern Germany. The BDI 
wants to present this initiative at the innovation forum of the 
Leipzig Fair on Wednesday [9 March]. 
  The BDI is calling on industry in western Germany to spend a 
considerable portion of its funds on research in the new 
laender. It referred to the capacities of over 180 enterprises 
with 4,000 employees. Details have been listed in a catalogue 
by the Technology Transfer Agency in Berlin. 
  The industrial association hopes to use this action to stop 
the further decline of capacities for industrial research in 
eastern Germany. Whereas a total of 86,000 persons were still 
employed in this sphere in 1989, the number has now fallen to 
11,500. The BDI is aware that both private enterprises and 
numerous public institutions are competing for the annual 
research amount of just under 1 billion German marks. Yet it 
stressed that, as a result of public subsidies, east German 
enterprises are able to offer attractive services. The federal 
promotion scheme "Commissioned Research East-West," under which 
east German research institutes receive subsidies worth 35-40 
percent of the overall research volume, has been prolonged until 
the end of 1994. 
  The BDI hopes that existing research institutions will 
develop into fertile ground for new industrial structures in the 
new laender. It referred to numerous successful examples in 
western Germany of the transfer of technology from research 
institutions to regional enterprises. For cost reasons, 
numerous companies have reduced their research capacities. At 
the same time, however, they depend on new developments. 
Industrial research must make use of this opportunity, the BDI 
stressed.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- GDP in the states of former 
East Germany increased by an average 7.1 percent in real terms 
in 1993, and thus rose by more than had been expected. This was 
announced by the Federal Economics Ministry in Bonn today. At 
7.4 percent in the second half of the year, it grew clearly more 
than in the first half of the year. Gross domestic product per 
worker in the states of former East Germany reached around 46 
percent of the Western level last year. 
  In the view of Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, 
the Federal Statistical Office's data confirm that there has 
been a high rate of growth in eastern Germany over the past two 
years. Following a temporary deceleration, the economic catching 
up process evidently has started to accelerate again somewhat. 
However, this could not yet be described as a self-sustaining 
recovery in the states of former East Germany. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Office for the Protection of the </F>
Constitution Fears Political Murders"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The Berlin security authorities are 
preparing for a "hot and bloody" spring. According to a 
confidential analysis of the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, an escalation of violence is imminent in the 
German capital. Above all an increase in the number of 
political murders has to be expected, the Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution warned the Berlin Senate and the 
police. 
  The background of the alarming assessment of the situation 
is 
the formation of a new "trend" in the autonomous scene in 
Berlin. According to DIE WELT information, it "is offensively 
advocating that the killing of fascists be deliberately accepted 
now when they are attacked." 
  The authorities fear massive riots, particularly in 
connection with the international soccer match between Germany 
and England. It is supposed to take place in Berlin on 20 
April, Adolf Hitler's birthday. In the scene paper INTERIM (No. 
274) it is stated that the match planned "on the Fuehrer's 
birthday in the stadium built by the Fuehrer in the capital of 
the Fuehrer's Reich" is a provocation. 
  INTERIM takes the view that the politically responsible 
persons want to use the opportunity to provoke riots "for the 
benefit of the `law-and-order' policy in the election year." As 
the homes of refugees had to burn after the abolition of the 
asylum-law, Berlin has to burn now. It continues literally: 
"There must not be such an unspeakable alliance with a 
concentration of fascist groups of thugs, hooligans from the FRG 
and England who are prepared for violence, thousands of heavily 
armed cops, and riots in the surroundings of the stadium and far 
beyond it: Let us prevent the match!" 
  Independently of these calls, extreme-left "groups of 
migrants" are currently also canvassing for an FRG-wide 
demonstration in Berlin on 20 April. They want to "strike back" 
against the "Nazis." 
  And this is the definition of their terrorist position: "We 
are living in hostile surroundings.... It is not surprising 
that a fascist might also be killed in a climate that it 
politically heated by racist pogroms and oppression." 
  The authorities estimate the number of autonomous persons 
who 
are prepared for violence at more than 5,000 in the FRG. They 
continue to be concentrated in the conurbations of Berlin, 
Hamburg, Frankfurt/Main, and the Ruhr area.

<F P=106> [Article by Carola Kaps: "A Firm Hand Is Missing in the </F>
White House"] 
  [Text] Washington, 7 March -- President Clinton might be 
generally satisfied with his first 13 months of office. The 
recession is over, the economy is thriving, jobs are being 
created, and prices are relatively stable. NAFTA has been 
approved by Congress, and the Uruguay Round has finally been 
concluded. Initial agreements with the booming economies in 
Asia are emerging, and Clinton's first visit to Europe was 
generally praised, in spite of the war in Bosnia and the 
insecurity regarding future developments in Russia. 
  Despite these successes and Clinton's considerable 
popularity 
among the U.S. population, things are not going well with his 
presidency. His political credibility, which was never really 
solid despite the approval, has become suspect because of the 
so-called Whitewater affair. In fact, the White House legal 
adviser who was mainly responsible for the amateurish handling 
of this insignificant story dating back to Clinton's Arkansas 
past has now left the stage. However, journalists have tasted 
blood. A special public prosecutor is investigating the case, 
and Congress is seriously considering hearings. 
  Behaving as though the Watergate scandal had never existed, 
Clinton's advisers, out of a false sense of loyalty, assiduously 
tried to protect the President and his wife Hillary with plump 
maneuvers and delaying tactics instead of disclosing everything 
at the very beginning and dispelling doubts and mistrust. With 
this bunker mentality, which would have done credit to Nixon, 
they succeeded in making a mountain out of a molehill. It is 
not true that they enriched themselves personally or that public 
funds were used for private or political purposes in connection 
with the Whitewater investments and their deals with a bankrupt 
savings bank. Clinton is a womanizer, but he is not greedy for 
money, the well-known journalist David Broder stated on 
television. 
  Thus, the inexpertness and foolishness with which Clinton 
and 
his advisers have handled the Whitewater issue since 1992, 
creating the impression that they have something to hide, is all 
the more inexplicable. Legal adviser Nussbaum played a 
particularly inglorious role in this respect. Yet Hillary 
Clinton, probably the president's wisest political adviser, also 
failed in this case. The reason may be that Hillary Clinton, 
who has thus far won friends and opponents with charm, expert 
knowledge, and political finesse, is for the first time the 
object of criticism. Clinton's wife is more deeply involved in 
the Whitewater affair than the President himself, and faces the 
danger of being discredited. She was not only responsible for 
the investment decisions of the Clinton family. She was also 
the lawyer for the savings bank in question, and she fiercely 
rejected the nomination of a special public prosecutor who 
should examine the Whitewater affair. 
  To make matters worse, her friends and colleagues from the 
Rose Partnership in Little Rock, Arkansas, who have been given 
positions in important government offices, have meanwhile gotten 
into difficulties. Nussbaum had to resign. Vincent Foster, the 
deputy legal adviser at the White House, committed suicide last 
summer for unknown reasons, and Webster Hubell, one of the 
deputies of the attorney general, is being investigated by his 
former law office because of the alleged fraudulent settlement 
of accounts. 
  It is quite obvious how this development, which overshadows 
and which might even paralyze important legislative tasks, 
including the health reform, was possible. Thirteen months 
after Clinton took office, there is still nobody at the White 
House who directs the destiny of the White House and controls 
the apparatus with a firm hand, expert knowledge, and political 
instinct. Mack McLarty, Clinton's friend and chief of staff, is 
willing but weak. David Gergen, who already served President 
Reagan as communications director, is more interested in his own 
future than in Clinton's White House. All the other aides are 
too young and inexperienced to be able to give good advice to 
Clinton. Moreover, none of them has the required courage to 
confront Clinton and his wife Hillary openly with unpleasant 
things, Washington officials claim. What makes the situation 
even more complicated is that the White House staff is serving 
two presidents -- Bill and Hillary -- and has to divide its 
loyalty between the two. Hillary's unprecedented powerful 
position reportedly creates problems, too. William Kristol from 
the "Project for the Republican Future" has offered another 
explanation: Since Bill and Hillary have not learned to 
distinguish between "public and private, and official and 
personal matters," it is nearly impossible for aides to Bill and 
Hillary to draw a clear line between ethically permissible and 
unacceptable actions.

<F P=106> ["br"-signed commentary: "Super Explosive 301"] </F>
  [Text] The reactivation of the Super 301 clause by 
President Clinton means an escalation of the trade conflict 
between the United States and Japan by degrees, only as far as 
the essence of the conflict goes. In terms of form, however, the 
escalation is quite significant. The heavy guns Washington is 
bringing to bear against the foreign trade practices of Japan 
and other states -- which are felt to be discriminating -- marks 
a new round in the trade conflict between the two biggest 
economies, a conflict that was predetermined by the failure of 
the American-Japanese summit two weeks ago. While the yen, as 
the most efficient correction instrument for disparities in 
Japanese foreign trade, boomed as expected after the failure of 
the summit, the United States is now voicing threats. 
  The President, represented by Trade Representative Kantor, 
made it quite clear who the primary U.S. target is: Japan and, 
still unexpressed, South Korea. Tokyo's first reaction was 
almost one of relief. The stock exchange reacted with friendly 
restraint, as the yen declined markedly, and the United States 
will do nothing but complete their list of complaints against 
Japan until 30 September. Although government and economic 
spokesmen in Tokyo expressed concern and criticism about the 
reactivation of Super 301, the certainty prevailed that a 
compromise will be achieved before a trade war breaks out. 
  So far, Tokyo has not been irritated by the pressure 
undoubtedly exerted by Super 301 and the ensuing deterioration 
of the political climate that signal danger for world trade. 
This will change. A petty, and probably embarrassing, list of 
Japan's sins will follow, drawn up by a still inexperienced U.S. 
Administration, and presented to a Japanese Government that 
largely is worn out. 
  For the Hosokawa government the escalation with Washington 
means another diplomatic failure, that will further undermine 
the prime minister's authority. During the next few weeks, while 
the United States is formulating its charge, composure in Tokyo 
will give way to hectic research into where Japan can compromise 
without losing face. In today's calm before the storm, Tokyo 
hopes it will be able to report the beginning of an upswing in 
12 months' time, which the United States -- quite mistakenly -- 
considers to be the precondition for reducing its deficit with 
Japan. 
  But the economic shift is significantly influenced by the 
external value of the yen. If, during the long procedure of 
Super 301 or because of excessive U.S. demands, the trade 
conflict is transferred back to the foreign exchange market, 
Japan's upswing will be delayed and America's patience strained. 
The scenario is so alarming that Washington and Tokyo are 
wooing Europe for assistance, and Japan wants to mobilize Asian 
neighbors as well. This opens up a position of mediator for 
Europe, which, if successful, might improve its position in 
Japan. But, if Japan's loneliness turns into isolation, it will 
withdraw to Asia even more quickly than it is doing anyhow.

  [Text] With the arrest of several prominent opposition 
members, the Chinese Government has shown what it thinks of 
Western criticism: nothing. Shortly before a visit by the U.S. 
secretary of state to Beijing, this appears to be a challenge. 
The United States has again and again threatened to withdraw 
the most-favored-nation status from China, but that is usually 
it. The Chinese market is too enticing. Europeans are behaving 
in a similar way. It has been argued that the closer the 
economic ties, the greater the chances for loosening up the 
rigid political system in China. Time and again, this has 
proved to be wrong. Nevertheless, the West is sticking to this 
illusionary policy. Even this time, officials will find an 
excuse. Maybe the dissidents will be released again after the 
People's Congress, due to open next week and which must not be 
disturbed by requests for more democracy. Maybe. At any rate, 
for the sake of economic interests, the West will again and 
again turn a blind eye to political suppression in China, and 
even more so in Tibet.

<F P=106> ["heb"-initialed commentary: "Slap in Clinton's Face"] </F>
  [Text] The recent arrest of Wei Jingsheng, the Chinese 
Sakharov, has been a slap in the face for U.S. President 
Clinton. Clinton had dared to come out very far with a 
regulation that links more favorable trade conditions for China 
to progress in the sphere of human rights. Yet his additional 
signals to the rulers in Beijing were ambiguous. While his 
human rights delegate was pointing his index finger at moral 
issues in Beijing this week, next door the trade delegate was 
promoting new contracts involving big money. 
  From this, Beijing seems to have drawn the conclusions -- as 
it did after Federal Chancellor Kohl's sales visit -- that all 
these Western tirades in connection with human rights are 
presented only half-heartedly. The brutal suppression of the 
Chinese opposition is disgusting, and Beijing's rulers are 
responsible for it. Yet, are China's conclusions and the 
criticism that the United States and Europe are being 
"two-faced" so wrong? 
  The menacingly pointed U.S. index finger produces 
conflicting 
feelings. If it is seriously meant -- good. Yet, if it is 
actually rather intended to soothe the U.S. public, which is 
outraged about repression in China, or as an instrument of trade 
policy to exert pressure -- then "no thanks!" 
  The advocates of "business as usual" should not deduce from 
it that pressure on Beijing might be totally dropped in the 
future. After all, the United States forced a human rights 
dialogue on the PRC. Should it have been meant seriously, then 
Wei Jingsheng and his fellow-fighters can gather fresh hope.

<F P=106> [Interview with Treasury Minister Pietro Barucci by Demetrio </F>
Volcic; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Volcic] The economic problems of the past few 
days seem to have been overcome. 
  [Barucci] The Italian Government had no doubts about it. The 
Italian economy deserves trust. After the storm on the 
international markets things are better today. However, we 
should all be worried by rising global interest rates. 
  [Volcic] Would we be worse off without the 1992 devaluation? 
  [Barucci] We certainly would. The 1992 devaluation was a 
very painful operation. You know, when a country has to devalue 
it remains a defeated country for some time. But both the Amato 
and Ciampi governments very rigorously managed the devaluation 
by exploiting its positive aspects. Let us be frank: the 
current account balance over one year is 50 trillion [currency 
not specified] in debt. We heard today the surprising data 
referring to the balance of payments for January: a surplus of 
more than 5 trillion lire. The devaluation was a very painful 
operation, but I think that Italy has much to gain from it. 
Everybody is envious of these results. 
  [Volcic] After the devaluation, privatization. It looks like 
a success story. 
  [Barucci] The privatizations are the result of a cultural 
change in the country. The Milanese judges have helped us to 
privatize better. It was a very complex and difficult 
operation. One day I will publish the documents and letters 
which will prove the great difficulties we had to face in 
privatizing. 
  [Volcic] After you have done it, anything looks easy. 
  [Barucci] After you have done it, it seems very easy. The 
international press did not even think we could privatize a 
needle. 
  [Volcic] What are the next stages? 
  [Barucci] Steel and the last parts of SME [food]. Then the 
big things: INA [insurance company], STET [telecommunications], 
and ENEL [electricity]. 
  [Volcic] The stock exchange in Italy seems to be going 
through a second -- or maybe first -- flush of youth. 
  [Barucci] Let us say that it is its first youth. I remember 
that when I became treasury minister, 70-80 billion lire were 
traded at the bourse every day. Today, even if the criteria to 
calculate the figures have slightly changed, 1 trillion lire are 
traded daily. Things have definitely changed. 
  [Volcic] Will it last? 
  [Barucci] It must last because the country has everything 
that is needed to be a mature country, even as far as the stock 
exchange is concerned. Savers are now interested. For one year 
the press and commentators have been telling me: You want to 
privatize but there are no savings. Private companies are 
launching share issues, you see they are trying to make life 
difficult for you. What will the fate of state bonds be? Well, 
private companies have launched big share issues and state bonds 
are doing just fine. Yields have been cut by half in little 
more than one year. And, last but not least, we have had a 
great success with privatizations. We are going in the right 
direction. 
  [Volcic] What about public accounts. Any bad surprises 
around the corner? 
  [Barucci] The situation is obviously not good. The country 
still has a huge public debt. However, Italy is also the only 
country with a primary surplus over the past two years. 
[passage omitted]. The data for the first two months are 
surprisingly good. But we cannot be too optimistic. We thought 
that in the second half of 1993 we would have had some growth -- 
0.5-0.6 percent. The Italian economy actually went backward. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Volcic] What about unemployment, a world phenomenon? 
  [Barucci] For the time being, in this sphere there have been 
only defeats. But we are not alone. [passage omitted] 
  [Volcic] Does the confusion before the elections disturb the 
economy? 
  [Barucci] More than the economy, it disrupts markets. 
  [Volcic] Could you give a one-line definition of the Ciampi 
government's economic policy? 
  [Barucci] It is a very compact government which has greatly 
exploited the work done by the previous government, and which 
has kept a cool head when making decisions. There is a lot of 
harmony within the Cabinet, and we are able to provide action 
which has an immediate effect on things. 
  [Volcic] So why are you not a candidate? 
  [Barucci] It is not my job. At my age one cannot change 
one's way of life. I have another job. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Marco Panara: "Spaventa: Let Me Explain Why This </F>
Recipe Will Not Work"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Budget Minister] Luigi Spaventa does not 
appear on television. He does not like to reduce ideas to a 
single sentence, to express himself in slogans, or to trim his 
assessments back with a hatchet. He prefers situations in which 
he can develop his arguments and explain his thinking clearly. 
This, partly because economics, and especially tax matters, do 
not lend themselves well to slogans or, rather, the slogans that 
raise people's feelings in these fields conflict with the 
figures. So Spaventa tries to avoid them, even during an 
election campaign and even on television. 
  What he does like, however, is debate -- so much so that he 
decided to stand for election in Rome's constituency number one, 
precisely in order to challenge [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi's claim to a seat in the lower house. And the first 
thing that Spaventa did on "Milano, Italia" yesterday was to set 
his own position on taxation against that of Forza Italia or, 
rather, to demonstrate the impracticability of the "Martino 
theory" -- a reference to the person behind Berlusconi's 
economic program -- which aims to introduce a single 30 percent 
income tax rate. 
  "At present tax rates of up to 30 percent of taxable income 
apply to 95 percent of taxpayers," Spaventa said, "while higher 
rates apply to only the remaining 5 percent. If the aim were, 
by means of a number of allowances, to maintain the present tax 
burden on those paying less than 30 percent, while at the same 
time reducing the higher rates, there would be an immediate loss 
of revenue of 3.5-4 trillion lire. This presents two 
alternatives: Either we forego this large slice of revenue, 
which the state coffers cannot allow, or this burden is placed 
on the medium taxpayers, those declaring incomes of 40-80 
million lire, penalizing them still further." 
  Having finished with figures, Spaventa went on to tackle the 
issue of fair taxation: "Ronald Reagan included in his program 
the introduction of a single rate of income tax, but then the 
problem of ensuring neutrality for federal funds and for 
taxpayers by means of allowances in such a reform became a 
nightmare for him. He never found the solution, and indeed a 
single tax rate was never introduced in the United States." 
  "The problem," Spaventa added, "is that in order to avert 
enormous waste, the system of allowances must be extremely 
detailed, in which case the regulations would fill a whole book." 
  Having dismantled his adversary's proposals, Berlusconi's 
progressive rival went on to present his own proposal, which has 
three points: "What can be done is to reduce the number of tax 
rates, to lower the higher ones and to raise the lower ones, and 
to operate a simple system of deductions for personal income 
tax. In the case of legal entities, my proposal is to reduce 
the tax rate, which is officially very high, and to revise the 
entire taxation system, which at present favors indebtedness 
rather than the increase of risk capital. Last, there is 
investment income, and in this regard I very much like the 
proposal made by Finance Minister Gallo." Franco Gallo's 
proposal which was not pursued because of the early election, 
envisages the incorporation of taxation on all financial income 
(interest received, yield from bonds and government stock, 
dividends, and so forth) so as to make the tax aspect neutral in 
the choice of how savings will be employed. Tax would in any 
case be deducted by intermediaries at source.

"Telecommunications: The All-Out Battle"] 
  [Text] Behind the challenge for the new cellular telephone 
market. Fiat, Fininvest, Olivetti, ENI [Italian Hydrocarbons 
Corporation] in the arena for a 3-trillion-lire business. The 
common enemy: the SIP [Italian State-Owned Telephone Company]. 
It possesses a secret weapon. 
  A revolver pointed at the nape of the neck: "Pull over." The 
truck driver obeys the order, then surrenders the steering wheel 
as the hijacker places a hood over his head. The cargo ends up 
in a clandestine warehouse, and the hijackers abandon the TIR 
[International Road Transport] vehicle and its driver. But when 
does help arrive? Almost always too late. Each year Italian 
insurance companies pay out 4 trillion lire for claims on TIR 
robberies. In two years, though, the story will have a different 
ending. As soon as the truck deviates from its route, a 
satellite will warn police headquarters, which in turn will 
sound the alarm. The credit goes to AT System, a small 
Rovereto-based enterprise, which together with Seat and Apple 
has already developed the solution. But above all, the credit 
goes to the telecommunications crown's latest jewel, the GSM 
[Global System for Mobile Communications]. 
  Yes, the GSM, the so-called telefonino europeo [little 
European cellular phone] which is much more than just a cellular 
telephone set. It is a system of voice and data transmission 
that will change our everyday lives. The "telefonino europeo" 
[smaller and lighter than the "telefonino tradizionale" which in 
popular usage identifies with Italy's present conventional 
SIP-operated cellular system] will make it easier to call a taxi 
and find a hospital bed. For the price of a local call we will 
be able to exchange written messages. Motorists will be kept 
constantly informed of traffic conditions. A revolution that in 
a few years, in Italy, will have enlisted at least 4 million 
subscribers, and that, to the network carriers, will be worth 
3-4 billion lire a year. In keeping with a European Community 
directive against monopolies, the GSM carriers will be two: the 
public sector's SIP and a private-sector group. 
  The competition is entering the heated stage. On Saturday 15 
January the private-sector candidates formally stated their 
interest in participating in the bidding that between April and 
May will decide who the second GSM carrier will be. In the days 
preceding this first step, the maneuvers had become increasingly 
intricate, ending in the surprise alliance between the team of 
companies of the ENI group and the consortium led by Fiat and by 
Fininvest (publisher of PANORAMA among other things). The next 
two weeks will usher in another decisive step: The much awaited 
call for bids, with the rules that will regulate the new market. 
  The fight for the big money-making GSM market will be 
extremely harsh. On one side SIP, which until now has enjoyed 
the telecommunications monopoly and is determined to sell its 
skin dearly. On the other, all the big Italian groups that have 
entered the arena, in competition with each other, and are ready 
to invest 1.5 trillion lire over the next five years. A risky 
investment? Apparently not. Rather, a good opportunity. From 
Olivetti to Fiat, from Fininvest to Marzotto, backed by 
international telecommunications giants, everybody is well aware 
of the success of Italy's traditional cellular telephone system: 
1.2 million subscribers, 200,000 in the last three months alone, 
in spite of the recession; and billings totaling 1.5 trillion 
lire. 
  But, in view of the extremely tough underground battle the 
SIP is already waging, the GSM's big money-making potential 
could also prove to be not very profitable for the 
private-sector carrier during the initial years of operation. 
First of all, thanks to heavy investments and contained rates, 
through its public monopoly and with sights set on the future 
GSM, SIP has been able to push its marketing of cellular 
telephones to the limit, and has thus captured a sizable market 
advantage. Secondly, through the political pressures it has been 
applying, SIP could pull off a surprise coup: Demand 
indemnification for the loss of its monopoly, at the expense of 
the second carrier. 
  At any rate, by the end of 1995, by which time the European 
"telefonino" is expected to become fully operational, the 
state-owned carrier will enjoy a commanding position. "In two 
years, SIP will have 2 million subscribers between its 
traditional and GSM cellular systems, whereas the second carrier 
will have at most 300,000," says Franco Morganti, vice president 
of Teknibank, a high-technology-market research company. "The 
private-sector company will not have an easy road. SIP will be 
in a position to suggest to its subscribers who might be tempted 
to go to the competition's GSM that they continue subscribing to 
its traditional cellular telephone service at slashed rates, 
inasmuch as, by that time, its investments for the old network 
will already have been amortized." 
  It will certainly not be easy to defeat SIP with a price 
war, 
considering that, thus far, its public-sector GSM rates are the 
lowest in Europe (even though subjected to a tax system that is 
less favorable than in many other countries). SIP's GSM rates 
average 663 lire per minute, versus Great Britain's 830 lire, 
and the lowest-priced German carrier's 1,154 lire. 
  Services, for the most part, will thus be the field on which 
the game will be played. And from this viewpoint, the GSM has 
enormous potential. Far more than that of mere cellular 
telephone service! While traditional cellular terminals are of 
the analog type, requiring transmission by way of sounds, GSM 
terminals are full-fledged microcomputers that talk to each 
other in bit language, and permit contact with all of Europe's 
connected areas without national limitations. They can transmit 
data without using modems or faxes, which are costly and 
generate annoying distortions. Two bursts will suffice to send 
the equivalent of a two-page document. The telephone-answering 
system will signal the presence of recorded calls. The billing 
facility will no longer be connected to a terminal, but instead 
to a microprocessor-equipped card that can be moved from one 
suitably equipped telephone set, fax, or modem to another. 
  But there is much more. The connections to central offices 
capable of providing services will be easier to make. By 
installing the GSM card in a microcomputer such as Apple's 
Newton, for example, the motorist can have a navigation system: 
A map of the zone in which he finds himself will appear on his 
video screen, together with a recommended itinerary for reaching 
his destination. Subscribers will be warned if there is fog on 
the road. And a service center will be able to keep parked cars 
under surveillance in order to foil robbery attempts. And there 
is more. It will be possible to send an identical message 
simultaneously to groups of subscribers with the same 
requirements: to every stock-exchange investor, for example, who 
is to be advised in case the Comit index exceeds a certain 
threshold value. It will also be possible to operate taxi and 
TIR fleets. And Olivetti has already developed a system to 
optimize the dispatching of police cars. 
  The network carriers will be able to offer all these 
services 
directly or through third parties with whom they will share the 
receipts. "SIP's aspiration is to generate traffic" says an 
analyst. "SIP will therefore subcontract the services, settling 
with the contractors within 60 days, and earning a banking 
profit. The private-sector company instead will be inclined to 
offer services directly, aiming at value-added returns." 
  But which privately owned group will be the winning 
private-sector GSM carrier? In the absence of presently 
unforeseen developments, according to observers, the top 
contenders are Unitel and Omnitel. 
  Unitel gained strength on Tuesday 11 January by allying 
itself with the group headed by ENI. Thus, as of today, this 
consortium consists of Finintel (51 percent Fiat and 49 percent 
Fininvest) with 54 percent of Unitel's stock; Vodafone 20 
percent; SNAM [National Gas Pipeline Company], AGIP Petroli 
[Italian National Oil Company], and Italgas [Italian Gas 
Company] with a total of 13 percent; Bell South 10 percent; and 
minor partners including Salvatore Lingresti's Premafin. Omnitel 
consists of Olivetti with 51 percent, Bell Atlantic 16.6 
percent, Cellular Communications International 14.7 percent, 
Telia 9.7 percent, and Lehman Brothers 8 percent. 
  Both groups can count on important strong points. Both have 
international allies that have already acquired eminent 
experience in the sector. Francesco Caio, president of Omnitel, 
can count above all on Olivetti's computerization expertise and 
on its capacity for integrating computer, telecommunications, 
and fax technologies. The group, moreover, has already begun 
developing the software to operate certain specialized services. 
  Unitel, on the other hand, headed by Niccolo Nefri, besides 
its know-how in the operation of national networks, and its 
ownership of many sites suitable for antenna installation, 
already possesses private telephone lines today that will tend 
to minimize the difficulties of covering the territory. 
"Furthermore, Italgas's contribution should not be 
underestimated," says Nefri. "This company knows everything 
there is to know about the business of billing, which is a very 
important technical problem." 
  According to international analysts interviewed by Reuters, 
the group headed by Olivetti has long been the number one 
favorite, but the Fiat-Fininvest group's chances appear 
increased by its association with ENI. "That agreement was not 
good news for Olivetti, because it strengthens Unitel in the 
very areas in which it lacked technical experience" says Jan 
Macleod, a NatWest analyst. "As far as software is concerned, 
Olivetti remains the strongest" Alberto Rella from Milla &amp; Co 
notes. "But as regards hardware, Unitel is now ahead. Moreover, 
by joining forces with ENI, Unitel has gained strength from 
political contacts." 
  In fact, private-sector groups will have to know how to 
lobby 
effectively in Rome. Because the problem will be not only that 
of defeating a market leader as strong as SIP in the 
marketplace. Some obstacles could be of another nature. The 
government had established relatively burdensome prerequisites 
from the outset, for privately owned companies. These included 
capitalization requirements for eligible consortiums, tight 
deadlines for submitting applications; and a commitment to cover 
40 percent of the Italian territory with the GSM network within 
18 months. 
  But the next moves will be the crucial ones. By the end of 
January, the Telecommunications Ministry, headed by Maurizio 
Pagani, will publish its call for bids, a 50-page set, 
approximately, of specifications on which the interested 
consortiums must base their definitive bids. "The important 
pages of that call for bids will be mainly three," says an 
expert: "Those containing the rules that will regulate relations 
between SIP and private-sector companies." The problem is one of 
the thorniest. Telephone calls made by subscribers of the second 
carrier--and especially those made to traditional 
telephones--will in fact have to transit portions of SIP's 
networks. And SIP's charges for this transit could be high 
enough to cause financial problems for its competitor. 
  "The governments of all countries of the world," says 
Unitel, 
"regulate relations in such way as to guarantee the conditions 
governing competition." In Italy, this cannot be taken for 
granted. SIP wants to be compensated for the loss of its 
monopoly and is expected to request the government's 
authorization to compensate for its losses at the expense of the 
competition, by making the private-sector carrier pay through 
the nose, at very high rates, for the public-sector lines it 
will have to use, thus exacting a toll that could cost the 
privately owned company hundreds of billions of lire. Might this 
suffice to convince the privately-owned groups to throw in the 
sponge? Some experts believe the possibility exists. SIP's 
indemnification could be borne by the state, of course. But 
Palazzo Chigi is turning its deaf ear in the direction of this 
proposal. 
  Another analyst argues, however, that "SIP cannot be having 
peaceful dreams, because the intent of the antitrust authority 
is specifically to prevent any abuse of dominant position." 
Indeed, in this market, the competition will quickly broaden to 
include new carriers, for the very reason that the GSM is a 
European system. Between 1996 and 1998, at the very time, that 
is, when the new system becomes fully operational, deregulation 
will also enter into effect. This means that an Italian in Italy 
will be able to subscribe to the service even in Denmark if he 
finds it more advantageous to do so, and that lobbying 
strategists for the protection of market shares can expect to be 
given their walking papers.

<F P=106> [Report by Umberto Rosso: "This Is How We Will Wage War on </F>
Taxes -- the Professor Wrings Applause"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi's 
"minister of finance," in the velvet setting of a Parioli hotel 
to present the "miracle" program to Rome's upper bourgeoisie, 
surprisingly finds himself on the same wavelength as the 
Communist Renewal, which wants to tax treasury bills. Antonio 
Martino, Forza Italia's economic expert, smiles and speaks with 
a voice strained from too many debates: "Yes, the premises 
which [Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti starts out from are 
sacrosanct: The present system, the taxation of public debt 
securities, is unjust. But the paths separate here, and I draw 
totally different conclusions." Professor Martino does not 
think of making people pay interest on treasury bills, nor does 
he espouse the measure of registering securities, which would be 
"dangerous." "At least for the time being," he states, until 
such time that the virtuous mechanism bearing Berlusconi's name 
comes into motion, which should restore the state's finances. 
"Reasons of political opportunity" suggest that it is better to 
make do with this situation, which we have not created, but 
which has come about over many years, until such time as the 
restoration of the public finances allows us to take provisions 
in the direction indicated also by [economist] Mario Monti. 
Hence, according to what the quoted economist is suggesting, 
the future according to Martino for treasury bills is the 
"bringing in line of their tax treatment with that of other 
investments." 
  And yet, Bertinotti's idea has raised ferocious opposition 
in 
the "pole of freedoms," a war on the communists who wish to 
annihilate government securities. "No, not from me. And then, 
if one looks behind all the various positions, the absurd fact 
is this: In Italy, two citizens enjoying the same income are 
treated in two totally different ways. The person earning it 
from working is punished with a confiscatory tax system. The 
other, whose income comes from interest on public debt 
securities, pays not one lira of tax." 
  The war cry, which fires off applause from the elegant 
audience and the rostrum (all the Rome candidates: Fabrizio del 
Noce, Gustavo Selva, Publio Fiori, etc.), is the war on taxes: 
The raising of deductions and the single personal income tax 
rate of 30 percent are the "two pillars" of the program, which 
have unbridled the "most uncivilized, heedless, disorderly 
reaction by the left, evidently short of arguments, against us." 
One reason more not to abandon the confrontation. By the way, 
Professor Martino, is it true that you refused a face to face 
interview with Budget Minister Spaventa in front of the "Milan, 
Italia" TV cameras? "No. First of all, they told me that 
yesterday evening there would be Spaventa, then Visco [in charge 
of Democratic Party of the Left tax policy]. But I do not suit 
them and the job went to someone else." Is this not a wish to 
escape confrontation, following Berlusconi's line? "Nothing of 
the kind. We have been confronting Spaventa for a very long 
time. Maybe, if he did not insult me, it would be more 
pleasant." Forza Italia's economist confesses having been 
tempted to impose a blackout on those newspapers which 
ill-treated him worst. ("One cannot run the headline `Come 
Forward Martino,' that is the limit...") but he quickly changed 
his mind. Is he offended if one talks of a magic wand for those 
million jobs which are promised? He replies with the numbers: 
"If we manage to obtain the detaxation of fiscal burdens, the 
three-year extension for the net creation of new jobs -- and not 
the entrepreneur who dismisses and then rehires, this is fraud 
-- I believe that this would represent an enormous stimulus for 
employment." In just two years, as Berlusconi guarantees, a 
million new people brought into the workforce? "Well, perhaps 
this was an objective thrown out..."

<F P=106> [Interview with Umberto Bossi, Italian Northern League </F>
Secretary, by Guido Passalacqua; place and date not given: 
"Bossi's Anathema: No Propaganda Due Prime Minister" -- first 
paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- He denied that he was attacking [Forza 
Italia leader] Berlusconi ("I am stating the facts") but Umberto 
Bossi is still continuing his assault on him. Forza Italia's 
chairman tried to play things down and confirmed his "full 
support" for the League. But he did acknowledge the suspicion 
that Bossi "wants to lead not the pole for freedoms but the 
say-what-you-like pole" and urged the League to avoid 
"self-damaging attacks of jealousy." "The alliance enjoys a 
good lead; we will not let one own-goal cast us into despair." 
But Bossi is not moderating his language. 
  [Passalacqua] In Florence Berlusconi said that "our allies' 
candidates are the blood of our blood, the flesh of our flesh." 
What is your reply to that? 
  [Bossi] What is Berlusconi? A vampire? 
  [Passalacqua] A wisecrack is not enough to overcome opinion 
polls. 
  [Bossi] The fact is that an attempt is being made to conceal 
things. The League is helping voters to see how matters stand 
within the parameters for freedoms created at the Assago 
congress. 
  [Passalacqua] But Berlusconi is your ally, he is putting 
himself forward as a candidate for the premiership. 
  [Bossi] If you are suggesting Berlusconi to me for prime 
minister, then I say "no." The prime minister is there (he 
pointed to [League lower house floor leader] Maroni), and in any 
case there will be no prime minister belonging to Propaganda Due. 
  [Passalacqua] That is a fine way not to engage in polemics 
with an ally. 
  [Bossi] I am not leveling charges, I am simply clarifying 
matters. I am just saying that I do not think that he is 
behaving acceptably. 
  [Passalacqua] In what way is it unacceptable? 
  [Bossi] If he says that he is close to the League, he does 
so 
only in order to confuse people. The League is the League, and 
Forza Italia is Forza Italia. It confuses not League members 
but the supporters, the artisans, and the small industrialists. 
It was we who carried out the revolution. He is hoping to 
confuse voters, and he can do so because through his television 
channels he enters people's homes and brainwashes them. 
  [Passalacqua] Is he confusing the voters? 
  [Bossi] He is trying to act the fox in our electoral chicken 
coop. I do not think that he will succeed, even if he wears 
make-up, powder, and a mask. Of course, he may gain some votes, 
but not in the part of the country important to me: the North. 
The League will win here. It is not Fininvest's flag that 
flies over Milan, but the League's flag. 
  [Passalacqua] How do you manage to stay together? 
  [Bossi] In all revolutions there are always two forces 
engaged in a dynamic relationship for hegemony -- that which 
carried out the revolution, the League, and the representatives 
of the old system that are worming their way into the new. 
  [Passalacqua] The recycled ones? 
  [Bossi] Let us call them the sudden converts. Forza Italia 
are the sudden converts, the old five-party alliance defeated in 
the field. Now, driven by necessity, they have insinuated 
themselves into the change. So it is inevitable that these 
conflicts will occur within the pole that will win the elections. 
  [Passalacqua] Will you win? 
  [Bossi] I am sure we will win. This, partly because we have 
put a strait jacket on the sudden converts. No less than 70 
percent of the votes for the pole in the North are votes for 
League candidates. And in the proportional round people must 
know the truth. We expect them to vote for the League. If the 
sudden converts were to prevail, they would oppose change. 
  [Passalacqua] One opinion poll suggests that the pole for 
freedoms will receive between 316 and 331 seats in the lower 
house. What do you think? 
  [Bossi] I will reply by telling you what I know. I believe 
that the League will gain 180 deputies, and that Berlusconi will 
gain the same number in the South. Together, we will form an 
absolute majority and govern with the League setting the course. 
Because if those people smell jam.... 
  [Passalacqua] What about [National Alliance leader] Fini? 
  [Bossi] Never with the fascists. How can we join Europe if 
we accept the fascists in the government? That would be 
tantamount to admitting that the fascist pigsty can spread 
across Europe. We will not govern with stinking fascists. They 
are the Mafia, the brothel. We are the wind from the North.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonio Dipollina: "Fini Snubs Berlusconi: </F>
Occhetto Better Than Him"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- On the day when [Northern League 
Secretary] Bossi consigned himself to the trash heap of history, 
[National Alliance leader] Fini raised his eyebrows to the 
television cameras and then continued insulting his "non-ally." 
The latest episode in the endless dispute on the right took 
place on the "Mixer" television show when the National Alliance 
leader yesterday tried to treat the "losing" Bossi 
superciliously. "He is afraid of the elections, he is envious 
of those who are taking away his votes. He is almost 
ridiculous, now that he is spurning the very votes in the south 
that he previously sought to gain by every means. As for 
ideologies, we can forget about Bossi; I do not think that he 
knows what they are." In jest, he played the tower game that he 
himself suggested: "If I had to choose between [Secretary of the 
Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] Occhetto and Bossi, I would 
throw off the latter. I cannot forget the way in which League 
members treated the mayor when he talked about solidarity." 
  "When Bossi tried to gain votes in the south they sent him 
back to the valleys." He added: "I am not worried about the 
disputes within the [rightist] alliance. If a voter hears Bossi 
speak, he will not decide to vote for Occhetto, but he could 
vote for me." What if Bossi became crucial to your accession to 
government, [show host] Minoli asked? "That is simple. It is 
enough that he adhere to two essential points -- national unity 
and solidarity." 
  The insults and attacks that Fini directed at the League 
leader were almost matched by the respect with which he treated 
Occhetto and his many reservations about his ally, [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi. In the end Occhetto nearly came out better 
("So what if Berlusconi calls them communists? I call them the 
PDS.") Spurred on by Minoli, Fini told Berlusconi that the 
television system must be reorganized with new rules that apply 
to everyone, including Fininvest ("Cutting back the public and 
private networks and improving the quality of television 
programs.") What is his criticism of Berlusconi? "His tendency 
to feel often like the center of the world." One of your 
proposals, Minoli said, is to grant small- and medium-sized 
entrepreneurs the same credit treatment reserved for major 
groups. Does Berlusconi know that? "Certainly he knows it. 
Within the pole for freedoms we are the component that 
guarantees social awareness and solidarity." There was also a 
brusque reminder to [Forza Italia economist] Antonio Martino and 
Forza Italia on the tax question: "They said that allowances to 
those earning less will compensate for the single tax rate, but 
they have not explained how. Martino has a duty to explain 
these allowances right away and to be clear about the whole 
issue. He said that a family of four in Rome can live on 18 
million lire a year: That is not true; it is not enough. 
Martino must be clearer." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["f.ver." interview with Italian Northern League ideologue </F>
Gianfranco Miglio in Milan; date not given: "Men Piloted by the 
Christian Democratic Bosses" -- first two paragraphs are LA 
REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Milan -- No, it is true that a lot of Northern 
League members do not like the marriage with [Forza Italy 
leader] Berlusconi. There is muttering, an abandoning of 
serious argument, and a lot of bad temper, with people saying 
that nothing good can come of this electoral campaign which, if 
one listens to the forecasts, sees the League-Forza Italia pole 
speeding like a freight train across the Lombard prairie. 
  What does Professor Gianfranco Miglio think of this? Miglio 
was one of the first, months ago, to warn the League against the 
danger of so many former Christian Democrats and former 
Socialists jumping onto the Berlusconi bandwagon. "At the end 
of all this we will, as always, have our usual major success in 
Lombardy, and Silvio Berlusconi will also be discreetly 
successful. But I have observed that his team, in fact, has 
made slightly hurried choices. They have been precipitous and 
frivolous, and have chosen people who are visibly 
remote-controlled by the old Christian Democratic bosses. 
Although I have to recognize one thing." 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What, professor? 
  [Miglio] In a country in which everyone was Christian 
Democrat, even the dogs and cats, it becomes very difficult 
indeed to find anyone who did not compromise with the DC 
[Christian Democratic Party]. I still feel that with a bit of 
patience they could have found other people and they recognize 
this. But they had very little time, with the obvious 
consequences. Right now that is the reaction among the League, 
which is ultimately a good thing. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] And why? 
  [Miglio] Because it shows that the League is not like I 
slightly feared, given their largely Christian Democratic 
origin. They are not people disposed to compromise, they react 
very negatively to the prospect of having to set aside the 
League's program. In fact we are finding that the League is 
very stubborn. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Professor, you are not one of those who 
believe that, ultimately, the League could end up weakened by 
the agreement with Silvio Berlusconi? 
  [Miglio] No, because those who used to say: "I like the 
League's principles, but not the League's members, because they 
are coarse and churlish," are now voting for Berlusconi and in 
this way their votes are going to the alliance. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] In the meantime [Northern League Secretary] 
Bossi continues to prick his Forza Italia ally. 
  [Miglio] Excuse me, is your conception of the alliance like 
the way people used to see marriage? A union for life, until 
death? This is rubbish. We are talking about something else. 
Both the progressive line-up and our own have made purely 
electoral agreements. And our alliance will last until the 
evening of 28 March. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] And then, Professor Miglio, what will 
happen? 
  [Miglio] Then we shall see how many votes and what cards 
everyone holds and the game will begin. And we will see how the 
elected representatives will vote in parliament, whether the 
Popular Party people, [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni's 
people, and the DC people who have wormed their way into 
Berlusconi's party, will hear the same tune and vote together.

<F P=106> [Report by Vittoria Sivo: "We Must Fight the New Right"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- The Berlusconi-Bossi-Fini axis is "a serious 
threat to democracy." Thus, led by Bruno Trentin and backed by 
its powerful apparatus and the weight of its 5 million members, 
the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] is deploying 
in mass against the "new right" and its "destabilizing and 
subversive" plans. 
  A further sign of the difference between the upcoming 
elections and previous ones is the unprecedentedly clear-cut way 
in which the largest of the three trade union confederations has 
taken sides. Has the sacred rule of trade union autonomy been 
dispensed with? 
  Not at all, answered the trade union leaders at Corso Italia 
[CGIL headquarters], because, contrary to other trade unions, 
"we are not fighting for this or that party or coalition," but 
rather "against" the bloc "made up by the League, Forza Italia, 
and the former fascists." 
  This is a "duty," Trentin explained in the course of a press 
conference, because this new right "is endangering the 
individual and collective rights which our democracy -- despite 
all its limitations and distortions -- has guaranteed over the 
past 40 years." What is at stake is a heritage of democratic 
conquests which "must be defended, enriched if anything, but 
never called into question." 
  The CGIL's dislike for the coalition "that wants to organize 
a right which is much more radical even than Thatcher or Reagan" 
is so intense that a hardened Bruno Trentin has sent a copy of 
the CGIL's electoral platform to all parties except to the 
opposing group, just as in the past the trade union excluded the 
parties that were outside the so-called constitutional spectrum 
from the list of its interlocutors. 
  Illustrated by CGIL Secretary Angelo Airoldi, the CGIL's 
document -- which is closer to a political appeal addressed to 
its own activists than to a traditional list of priority social 
and economic issues to be raised in the new parliament -- sets 
out the "distinguishing criteria, regarding values and 
alignments" which the trade union considers to be essential. 
  To begin with, antifascism, understood also as 
"uncompromising opposition to those forms of authoritarianism, 
racism, and contempt and aggression targeting those who are 
weaker"; in the second place, "the defense of national unity, as 
a concrete and necessary area" for effectively exercising 
solidarity. "The CGIL urges its own members and workers in 
general to follow these two criteria in the electoral campaign 
and when casting their vote." 
  In referring to the referendums promoted by [Radical leader] 
Marco Pannella, Silvio Berlusconi, and Umberto Bossi, the CGIL's 
secretary general did not hesitate to define the right's aims as 
"destructive" (albeit confused). Such aims range from the 
request to abolish at-source taxation on employees' income 
("which would have devastating consequences in terms of being 
certain of revenue levels from taxation"), to the abolition of 
unemployment benefits ("a revenge against the weaker"), to 
denying workers the right to chose their own trade union through 
delegates. 
  A constant comparison was drawn between the new conservative 
bloc and the practice of "social egoism, based on the denial of 
solidarity" which is today expressed through "a wave of 
neofascist group violence, directed at immigrants in particular." 
  Trentin referred to the recent attack in Ostia, and called 
for stricter penal and civil provisions to punish this kind of 
offense, including sexual offenses. 
  In this same vein, the CGIL is asking for immigrants to be 
given voting rights in the local elections. 
  Many of the social and economic priorities listed in the 
CGIL's platform are also shared by the CISL [Italian 
Confederation of Trade Unions] and the UIL [Italian Federation 
of Trade Unions]. The CGIL leader was keen to emphasize these 
points in common, denying that the CGIL's initiative was to be 
regarded as running counter to unity. 
  Regarding the controversial question of taxing treasury 
bills, the Confederation is not siding either with [Democratic 
Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto or Berlusconi, but 
aims to adopt an autonomous position, as it has in the past. It 
is in favor of making newly issued bills nominal -- "the 
Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] also 
agrees" -- and gradually bringing all forms of income under the 
taxation system. It is also in favor of reforming income tax on 
financial operations and on the interest from treasury bills, by 
abolishing the current proportional contributions and making 
them progressive under the IRPEF [personal income tax] system. 
  In order not to penalize small savers, a tax-free income and 
savings bracket should be introduced. 
  As regards employment, Bruno Trentin's trade union 
confederation has not given up the idea of a "national 
solidarity loan" which, instead of generic treasury bills to 
cover the public debt, would offer bills with long-term, assured 
returns. These would benefit from tax relief and be used to 
constitute a development and job creation fund.

given: "If Mino Had Joined the Left..." -- first paragraph is 
LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- The atmosphere in Massimo D'Alema's office 
in the Chamber of Deputies was that of a removal. This was the 
last day in Rome for the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
floor leader, who is to begin his electoral campaign as a "red" 
candidate in Gallipoli. In the area of traditionally Catholic 
Puglia, the PDS starts from a support level of 15 percent. He 
was packing his belongings, looking through a bundle of letters, 
most of them handwritten. "I got thousands of them," he said, 
"following Craxi's accusations. Some of them are very moving, 
wonderful -- a mirror of Italy, a civilized country." 
  [Marroni] In which now a right-wing wind is blowing, 
according to Umberto Eco. 
  [D'Alema] It is undeniable, and a reason for concern. But I 
do not believe the Right has won yet. I disagree with the 
bitter tone of Eco's closing remarks in the interview. The 
Right has no idea how to govern Italy. The Right means 
disintegration, and people are aware of this. 
  [Marroni] Certainly not the people -- Eco would say -- who 
are not used to a strict fatherly figure, but rather to 
collusive uncles and understanding mothers -- and who this time 
might decide to vote for "Uncle Berlusconi"... 
  [D'Alema] True, the Right does adhere to a certain Italian 
ethos, an opportunistic ethos that rejects the state, not 
because this ethos abhors social-democratic statism -- which we 
have never had in Italy, anyway -- but rather, because it abhors 
the very idea of legality. What does this Right amount to, 
apart from a jumble of particular interests? They have mustered 
all the areas of privilege, great and small. As a result, 
however, their messages are contradictory: ultraliberal in the 
North, welfarist in the South... 
  [Marroni] Therein lies the strength of the [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi operation. 
  [D'Alema] But also its weakness. Only the DC [Christian 
Democratic Party] managed to keep together such disparate 
interests. However, it had the anticommunist binder on its side 
and, above all, it made use of the public expenditure flywheel: 
Both of these elements are now missing. Berlusconi will have to 
choose which promises to keep; but whatever his choice, he will 
be unable to keep Italy together. You will see: In the end, 
the fear of a Yugoslavia-type process will act on citizens' 
consciousness. We often hear talk of a new 1948. It is true. 
However, international public opinion is now becoming the first 
to realize that the roles have been reversed. Today it is the 
Left which is offering the prospect of progress with no 
adventurism. 
  [Marroni] [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti is taking 
care of that. 
  [D'Alema] Bertinotti should keep quiet. The Left is the 
force of possible and necessary change. It will win if it 
reassures people, not if it frightens them. What is 
disconcerting, however, is the demise of the Center. 
  [Marroni] Do you miss the old DC? 
  [D'Alema] Not at all. The risk that the PPI [Italian Popular 
Party] may have to pay a very high tribute to the electoral law, 
without however stemming the drift toward the Right, results 
precisely from its shortsighted attempt to repropose the DC's 
centrality. 
  [Marroni] Would you have liked [PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli 
to have joined the Left? 
  [D'Alema] Of course. He would have endowed the progressives 
with a greater ability to persuade the moderates. 
Alternatively, he should have taken on the leadership of the 
conservative front, together with [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, 
rather than leave it in the hands of disquieting characters... 
  [Marroni] It often looks as if the Left is annoyed that 
there 
should also be a Right. 
  [D'Alema] The problem is not the Right in itself, but 
rather, 
this Right. Someone like Thatcher would have been useful in 
Italy. Instead, we are confronted by a heterogeneous aggregate, 
which lacks an experienced leadership. A dangerous aggregate. 
  [Marroni] Dangerous? 
  [D'Alema] I am not afraid for democracy. I am frightened by 
the government vacuum which can be inferred from the ambiguity 
of the Berlusconi-Bossi-Fini threesome. There is [Italian 
Social Movement (MSI) Secretary] Fini who is saying that he is 
not [League Secretary] Bossi's ally, and there is Bossi who 
swears he will never join the fascists in government. So, 
either the Right has no idea how it intends to govern the 
country, or it is attempting some trick or other. 
  [Marroni] Are you not perhaps painting the Right as the 
devil? 
  [D'Alema] It was not us who opened the "civilized debate" 
with a call to arms to fight communism. The progressives joined 
forces "for" something, around a platform. The Right joined 
forces "against" something, with hatred for the Left as its sole 
unifying element. 
  [Marroni] You yourselves, however, disparage Berlusconi's 
proposals, calling them "promises." Conversely, the fact that 
you are making no promises could mean that you are not in the 
position to assume any obligations. 
  [D'Alema] I also believe that the Left must abandon a purely 
defensive position. It will win if it emphasizes its positive 
proposals for government and gives assurances. We must put 
forward more forcefully our own distinctive position on decisive 
issues. We must commit ourselves -- to begin with, on the 
economic front, by closely linking recovery to a policy that is 
capable of ensuring sustained development and create jobs. We 
must address the tax issue in this light, not by promising the 
impossible, but by promising fairness. 
  [Marroni] Do you still bear Berlusconi a grudge? 
  [D'Alema] Well, personally I see no reason why I should. On 
the contrary, I should be joining Forza Italia. With my salary, 
combined with the 30 percent flat IRPEF [personal income tax] 
contribution and the scrapping of compulsory enrollment in the 
health service, Berlusconi in government would allow me to earn 
an extra 16,200,000 lire every year. On the other hand, all 
those workers earning 1.5 million lire a month would lose 1.5 
million lire a year. Then they have muddled things up with the 
story of the deductions. However, the basic fact remains that 
either this platform amounts to something -- in which case its 
social costs will be enormous -- or else it is just so much hot 
air, in which case it is obvious that a right-wing government 
would fuel inflation, and take us farther away from Europe. 
  [Marroni] A few evenings ago, [PDS Secretary] Occhetto 
rebuked Fini for joining forces with Berlusconi. I would have 
expected you to do the opposite. 
  [D'Alema] I think no one can doubt that Fini is more 
reliable, and less involved in the old establishment. The MSI 
is what it is, but as a party it has some political dignity, and 
some sort of base. However, it is the most corrupt sectors of 
civil and political society that have given birth to Forza 
Italia. It is an agonizing prospect to think that this country 
may have gotten rid of Craxi only to put his buddy in his place. 
  [Marroni] What about Bossi? 
  [D'Alema] Bossi made a historic mistake. By siding with the 
recycled elements of the old establishment, the League has 
completely lost its combat force characteristics. More than any 
other party, the bandwagon [League nickname] should have 
recognized a danger in Berlusconi -- a trump up the sleeve of 
the old establishment. The League is now paying for the lack of 
experience of its leadership, which was bamboozled by TV, money, 
daydreaming. "These guys will enable us to seize power because 
they will win in the South." But, as a matter of fact, the only 
ones who have the courage to speak to the man in the street in 
the South are the progressives and the MSI. 
  [Marroni] In people's homes, however, it is TV -- big 
brother 
-- who does the speaking. 
  [D'Alema] Yes, Big Brother has appeared in people's homes -- 
and he does have an impact. If you think of all the trash the 
Knight's [Berlusconi nickname] networks have inflicted on us in 
the last couple of months. 
  [Marroni] Are the progressives not exaggerating the extent 
of 
the Knight's TV power? 
  [D'Alema] I will limit myself to reminding you that, in a 
country with a majority-based electoral system, it is essential 
that everyone gets the same amount of coverage. This is not the 
case in our country. Nowhere else would a broadcasting tycoon 
have been allowed to found his own party. 
  [Marroni] However, you also know how to use television. Have 
you followed special courses, like Forza Italia's candidates? 
  [D'Alema] Of course not. I only try to say things clearly, 
and occasionally I try to have a witty reply ready. 
  [Marroni] As a matter of fact, it was during a television 
appearance, a few weeks ago, that you spoke of a constituent 
government being set up after the elections. You no longer 
mention this now. Were you just bluffing? 
  [D'Alema] This issue inevitably looms in the background, in 
a 
campaign such as this. I am glad to see that Martinazzoli is 
aware of this, but if the Right wins, his speeches will just be 
speeches. We can only pave the way for a constituent, caretaker 
government -- a national reconstruction government which is not, 
clearly, a left- wing government -- if the progressives manage 
to stop the Right. If we do not succeed, one of two things will 
happen: Either the country becomes ungovernable, or a 
government bringing together Bossi, Fini, and Berlusconi will in 
fact be formed. And I really hope I will never have to witness 
what those three are capable of doing together.

<F P=106> [Article by Kaj Skaaning: "Danish Help for Russian Oil </F>
Industry"] 
  [Text] Energy Minister Jann Sjursen (Christian People's 
Party) and DONG [Danish Oil and Natural Gas (Consortium)] 
Chairman Holger Lavesen have begun talks with Russia's energy 
minister on using Danish expertise in the race for the enormous 
oil and gas reserves in Russia. 
  The Russians are interested in attracting Danish know-how. 
Up 
to 40 percent of the world reserves of natural gas are found in 
Russia. 
  In connection with the just-completed visit to Moscow, 
discussions were initiated among Sjursen, DONG Chairman Lavesen, 
and Russian Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik. 
  "Among other subjects brought up were the possibilities for 
employing Danish expertise with respect to geological 
explorations and legislation dealing with the underground area," 
said Sjursen. 
  "In the area of gas and oil, there may also be interest in 
cooperating with regard to know-how, exporting, organizational 
issues, and tariff systems, as well as to training and 
management programs." 
  A number of enterprises and organizations from the Danish 
energy sector participated in the trip to Moscow, where at a 
seminar in the Russian energy ministry they had opportunity to 
present Danish technology and know-how in a number of 
energy-related fields, such as electricity and heat generating, 
district heating, renewable energy, oil and gas, as well as 
metering of consumer use. 
  "In the conversations with Shafranik I received a very 
current briefing on the enormous problems plaguing the Russian 
energy sector. Among other ways, these are revealed in falling 
energy production and in the serious debt crisis experienced in 
many Russian energy companies," continued Sjursen. 
  A cooperation agreement, which had been under preparation 
over a long period, was signed by the two ministers during the 
visit.

<F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Movement in Faeroese-British </F>
Conflict"] 
  [Text] The Faeroe Islands and the United Kingdom have 
taken a step forward in their efforts to reach agreement on 
where the demarcation line between the two countries is to be 
drawn. 
  After a new meeting in Torshavn, David Anderson, the chief 
British negotiator, said that the demarcation line dispute may 
be resolved within a few months. Because of large oil finds in 
the sea between the Shetland Islands and the Faeroes, it has 
become extremely important to reach an agreement. 
  David Anderson said that he would prefer that the two 
countries reach a negotiated settlement rather than the matter 
ending up before the International Court in The Hague. He 
believes that it will take months -- rather than years -- for 
the two sides to reach agreement. 
  Faeroe Islander Arni Olafsson of the Danish Foreign 
Ministry, 
the leader of the Danish-Faeroese delegation, said that the 
British negotiators have moved a little from their original 
demand, but that it is still impossible to say whether a 
solution will be found within the next year. 
  The Faeroes are demanding that the demarcation line between 
the two countries be drawn according to the median line 
principle, while Britain was originally demanding a demarcation 
line deep within the Faeroese economic zone. 
  Two major British oil finds -- estimated to contain a total 
of 1 billion barrels of oil -- close to the edge of the Faeroese 
fisheries zone have made it particularly urgent to resolve the 
demarcation line dispute. 
  After a decision in principle by the Lagting [Faeroese 
legislative assembly] that the country intends to begin 
activities in the oil industry, the Faeroes have put seismic 
surveys up for bid. 
  According to oil experts, if oil is found in the Faeroese 
mineral rights zone, the demarcation line dispute must be 
resolved before actual oil production can begin.

  [Text] Within the next few days the Danish Government and 
the Faeroese provincial government will jointly institute a 
committee that will be charged with elucidating the social 
economic transactions of the Faeroe Islands in the 1980's. 
  The committee's work will conclude with a report also 
containing a thorough examination of the administrative 
decisions made by the Faeroese banks in the 1980's that 
contributed to the bankruptcy of the two largest Faeroese banks. 
  The provincial government wants the committee to be 
appointed 
by 1 February so that the report can be finished by 1 July. 
According to a statement from the Faeroese Representative 
Council, the committee's members must all be independent from, 
among other things, the Faeroese banks, the National Bank, the 
Danish Bank, and the Financial Inspectorate.

<F P=106> [Article by Flemming Rose: "Big Migration Threatens </F>
Scandinavia"] 
  [Text] Russia is anticipating 8 million refugees from the 
former Soviet republics. These millions of refugees will pose a 
far greater threat to Scandinavia than asylum-seekers from 
Africa or Southeast Asia who try to get into Denmark via Moscow 
and the Baltic states. 
  Moscow -- The Scandinavian countries and Germany should make 
every effort to set up a cooperation with Russia to enable the 
world's second-largest nuclear power to accommodate the 6-8 
million refugees from the former Soviet republics who will 
inundate the country during the next couple of years, according 
to Russian authorities. 
  In the long run this task will be far more important for the 
security of the Scandinavian countries than the problems posed 
by the thousands of asylum-seekers from Southeast Asia, Africa, 
and the Middle East who are currently using Moscow as a way 
station en route to Denmark and other countries. 
  We were told this by a spokesman for the Russian refugee aid 
system. 
  "Since the breakup of the Soviet Union accelerated and the 
republics were hit by internal ethnic conflicts and economic 
problems, 2.5 million refugees have come to Russia from the 
former Soviet republics. All forecasts indicate that another 6-8 
million will come here from the former republics within the next 
three years," said Guran Sanikidze of the international division 
of the Russian refugee authority. 
<H5>  Room for 150,000 </H5>
  Sanikidze added that Russia will probably have room for the 
maximum of 150,000 potential refugees from Africa, the Middle 
East, and Southeast Asia who come to Russia as long as the 
country manages to deal with the reception of 6-8 million 
refugees from the former Soviet republics. 
  "The 6-8 million represent a far greater threat to the 
Scandinavian countries and Germany than the thousands who come 
from countries outside the former Soviet Union. One can only 
guess at the social explosions this will lead to unless the 
economic and political situation becomes more stable and it will 
be much simpler for these millions of people to go to 
Scandinavia than it is for refugees from Africa or Southeast 
Asia," Sanikidze continued. 
  Sanikidze said the Scandinavian countries could learn 
something from the agreement that Germany has reached with 
Poland and the Czech Republic on returning asylum-seekers to 
those nations. "One of the reasons why Poland and the Czech 
Republic signed the agreement was that Germany reciprocated by 
supplying technical equipment for the border police in the two 
countries. Russia is experiencing enormous problems with 
building up its borders and making them secure. It is not at the 
top of the economic agenda," Sanikidze stated. 
<H5>  Russians Show Great Willingness </H5>
  Russia signed the UN refugee convention a year ago. This 
means that Russia has agreed to participate in solving the 
world's refugee problems. Among other things refugees will be 
able to seek asylum in Russia and obtain residence permits there. 
  At present, however, the Russians have been unable to 
establish a procedure and infrastructure that would enable 
Moscow to process asylum applications and accommodate refugees. 
This may be the main reason why Moscow has become a way station 
for asylum-seekers from Sri Lanka, for example. 
  "We see great willingness on the part of the Russians to 
live 
up to their commitments as signers of the UN refugee convention. 
However, the lack of a social system and other institutions 
makes it difficult," said embassy secretary Kathrine Walentin 
Jensen of the Danish Embassy in Moscow. 
  She added, however, that Denmark does not yet regard Russia 
as a safe asylum country and this means that we do not 
automatically return asylum-seekers who come to Denmark from 
Russia. 
<H5>  Same Rights </H5>
  If Russian refugee authorities approve the applications of 
the asylum-seekers from such areas as Africa, the Middle East, 
and Southeast Asia who are currently registered with the UN 
Office of High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here in Moscow, 
the 10,000 families will theoretically obtain the same rights as 
Russia's other inhabitants. 
  "We hope that a procedure can be established for processing 
the 10,000 cases we have registered within a month's time," said 
Lawrence Jolles of UNHCR in Moscow. 
  The Danish Embassy in Moscow revealed that it has not 
received any asylum requests from Tamil refugees. The embassy 
receives an average of two requests for asylum and five requests 
from those wishing to be reunited with their families a month. 
Most of the requests come from Iraqis and Somalis respectively. 
  The number of Russians seeking Danish visas rose by 25 
percent in 1993. At present the figure is stable at around 
1,500-1,600 a month.

<F P=106> [Article by Bent Winther: "Minister: Barricading Europe No </F>
Solution"] 
  [Text] Pressure from large numbers of people from the 
former Soviet Union could become very dramatic. The solution is 
to help them at home, according to Justice Minister Erling Olsen 
(Social Democrat). 
  Justice Minister Olsen fears intense pressure on the Danish 
borders as a result of emigration from the former Soviet Union. 
  "It is the nightmare of the entire western world," he said 
against the background of the statements made by the Russian 
refugee authorities that BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's Moscow 
correspondent talked to. They estimate that 6-8 million refugees 
from the former Soviet republics will inundate Russia in the 
next couple of years. At present the Russians cannot accommodate 
the many refugees who will put increasing pressure on the 
Scandinavian borders. 
  "The pressure could be enormous. It will require very 
stringent border control and it could be very unpleasant," Olsen 
said. 
<H5>  Foretaste </H5>
  "A real migration could be a threat to the entire western 
world. Television tells them about our living conditions. The 
boat people who drifted ashore near Koge gave us a small 
foretaste of what lies ahead. It is an enormous problem that we 
have been warned about for some time. 
  ``And the solution is not to build a fortress around all of 
Europe but to give them so much assistance that they would 
rather stay at home. This will require economic sacrifices on 
our part,'' said Justice Minister Olsen. 
  The Russian refugee authorities are urging the Scandinavian 
countries and Germany to devote all their energy to a 
cooperation with Russia that will stem the tide. Olsen admitted 
that there are no concrete proposals for warding off the 
pressure, but referred among other things to the Nordic Council, 
which will take the matter up next month.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Fear of Electoral Defeat Sweeping Center Party"] </F>
  [Text] The big winner in the last parliamentary elections, 
the Center Party, has drifted into a back-against-the-wall 
position with only one more year before elections. The Esko 
Aho-led Center Party lost the local elections of 1992 and 
suffered a bitter defeat in the presidential elections. 
According to a recent poll, the Center Party is supported by 
only 17.5 percent of the electorate, which is the same level as 
during the Johannes Virolainen era. The Center Party is also 
being ravaged by tension within, above all by the presidential 
candidacies of Keijo Korhonen and Eeva Kuuskoski. 
  Center Party leadership is fully aware of the panic sweeping 
their party. How could it not be, for the dirty laundry from the 
presidential election is now starting to be sorted out in 
various places. Name lists are being collected in Kainuu for the 
support of Keijo Korhonen, while at the same time, some people 
are calling for the dismissal of both Korhonen and Kuuskoski 
from the party. Prime Minister Aho has himself called together 
strategy meetings of those close to him, at which the focus has 
been on how to avert a disaster in the parliamentary elections. 
  In 1991 the Center Party achieved an almost dreamlike 
victory: almost 25 percent of all votes and 15 new seats in the 
Eduskunta. If its support levels do not start to rise from the 
present levels, all of these new Eduskunta seats will be lost. 
The fear of electoral defeat is not unfounded. Having the 
responsibility of governing during a recession and the 
monetaristic economic policy are devastating the party. This was 
apparent already in the local elections when Center Party 
support dropped over 7 percent from the parliamentary election 
level. This development was historical, for the number of votes 
gathered by the party had increased only when compared to the 
1950 local elections. Center Party support in opinion polls is 
now being upheld only by the very core element of the party. 
  Aho has not publicly shown any signs of concern, at least 
not 
for the time being. He believes that the Center Party can 
prevail when it will show that the country's finances were put 
in order under its leadership. Aho, in fact, awaited the 
emergence of the first fruits already in the presidential 
elections and was disappointed when Elizabeth Rehn was not 
elected president after all. The sentiment was genuine, for he, 
along with all of the governing parties, clearly supported Rehn 
so as to shore up support for their governing position. Their 
support was even more definite than it had been for their own 
parties' candidates in the first round of the presidential 
election. 
  The presidential election result was a blow to Aho also for 
the reason that Martti Ahtisaari of the SDP (Social Democratic 
Party) was the winner. If the SDP gains a historical victory in 
next year's election, as the opinion polls seem to indicate, the 
Center Party will be at the mercy of its old nemesis. The SDP 
will then determine who they will accept into the cabinet. The 
very idea of it is like a horrible nightmare in Center Party 
eyes. 
  Aho need not fear for the sake of his own position yet at 
the 
party's convention next summer, even though cabinet member Seppo 
Kaariainen is giving him Vayrynen-like threatening warnings. 
Kaariainen's speech about a "rye bread policy" is anything but 
according to Aho policy. The warnings from this team of two are, 
however, merely the establishment of a stand at this point, and 
not an open challenge. 
  Gaining a tolerable defeat in the elections is important for 
Aho. Otherwise his position will become tenuous in the face of 
attacks by Vayrynen and Kaariainen. But how can Aho get an 
honorable result in the parliamentary elections when economic 
growth will not yet cut into unemployment, and when the taxing 
of wages remains extremely tight? A favorable balance of trade 
will not win elections. About the only way available to Aho is 
to spend a lot of money in the areas where the Center Party has 
support. As shocking as it may sound, the distribution of money 
is already happening at full speed. It commenced last week under 
the prime minister's stewardship in the first budget amendment.

<F P=106> [Jorma Poysa report: "Factional Voices Impede EU </F>
Negotiations"] 
  [Text] Our ability to maintain the confidence of foreign 
investors and ensure the start of domestic investments depends 
largely on whether Finland becomes a member of the European 
Union [EU], says Georg Ehrnroth, chairman of the TT [Central 
Federation of Industry and Employers]. 
  TT's new leader also stresses the importance of maintaining 
a 
steady course in economic policy. 
  "Predictability and stability are important," he stressed. 
  George Ehrnroth warns various interest groups against 
useless 
bullying on the EU issue. 
  "Declaring that `we will not join unless we get this and 
that...' is dangerous. This applies not to only the closest 
circle around the MTK [Central Federation of Agricultural 
Producers], but also the SAK [Confederation of Finnish Trade 
Unions], whose chairman has indicated a special link between the 
position on the EU and the general validity of the collective 
wage bargaining agreement. 
  ``Let us now get a good result through negotiations, not 
bullying. The people and the parliament can then decide whether 
to take it or leave it. 
  ``All of us surely agree that Finnish agriculture must be 
ensured a reasonable basis of existence. The rural districts 
must stay populated and we must safeguard our self-sufficiency 
in foodstuffs. 
  ``Agriculture cannot, however, cope better than the economy 
as a whole. Industry will prosper if we are in the EU. As a 
consequence, the whole economy -- including agriculture -- will 
fare better than outside the EU.'' 
<H5>  EEA Is Only the B League </H5>
  ``The choice is not between the past and the EU. What is at 
stake is our capacity to adapt inside or outside the EU. 
Adaptation within the EU is certainly easier in the long run.'' 
  Ehrnroth said that being part of the single market is an 
important prerequisite for attracting investments to Finland. 
  "The EEA [European Economic Area] agreement provides in 
principle good opportunities in this respect. But if the EU is 
the A team, the EEA remains just the B team. 
  ``Industrial enterprises always try to minimize their 
risk-taking in investments. As members of the EU we will be 
committed to convergence targets (targets of a disciplined 
economic policy), in a stronger way than now. This means 
greater adherence to the policies of low inflation, stable 
currency rates, and other general political objectives, than if 
we were members of the EEA,'' he explained. 
  "This will influence investment decisions among Finnish 
enterprises as well as direct foreign investments and purchases 
of shares on the Finnish stock market." 
<H5>  There Have Been Many Positive Developments </H5>
  TT's chairman said that the Finnish economy has shown many 
positive developments during the past year. A fundamental one 
has been the rapid growth in exports that has created a positive 
trade balance and further on a positive payment balance. 
Foreign debt, which was approaching a critical limit, has also 
turned. 
  The interest level has also come down and some intelligent 
solutions in terms of cost control and flexibility have been 
reached on the labor market. 
  "But the economy is still out of balance," said Ehrnroth, 
alluding to the high unemployment rate and the enormous deficit 
of the state economy. 
  ``It is essential that we do not stop and give a sigh of 
relief. We must stay on the steady course of restructuring. The 
depression is cyclical only in part.'' 
  The improved balance of payments has created a base for 
confidence in the Finnish economy. But to maintain this 
confidence we must continue our target-oriented financial policy. 
  "Any emerging doubts regarding the continuation of a dynamic 
export strategy will show as a halt in foreign investments. The 
crisis in finance may worsen again," Ehrnroth warned. 
  He gave the reminder that foreign investments on the stock 
market alone have reached 30-40 billion markkas in a short time. 
Other important direct investments are those of ABB [Asea Brown 
Boveri], ICL, and Kvaerner Masa-Yards. We should get more of 
these. 
<H5>  The Election Budget Is a Big Risk </H5>
  Ehrnroth said that historically there has been an 
"alarmingly 
high" correlation between election years and soft budgets. 
  "We cannot afford to make that mistake again. We must really 
hope that the government has stable ground under its feet." 
  Ehrnroth pointed out that the state economy contains 
concealed deficits over and above this year's 70-billion-markka 
national deficit. 
  "The TEL [Employee Pension System] alone contains a 5 
billion 
deficit this year." 
<H5>  Good Competitiveness Is Needed </H5>
  The Ministry of Finance estimates that Finnish price 
competitiveness is now about 40 percent above its historical 
average. Rapid growth in productivity, moderation in wage 
settlements, and the exchange rate of the markka will determine 
our competitiveness. 
  "The markka has strengthened lately. This is understandable 
due to the somewhat excessive weakening of the exchange rate. 
The growing pressure to force the markka upwards should now be 
countered with lower interest rates. A continued re-evaluation 
would be harmful to competitiveness and hurt exports, an area 
where success is extremely important." 
  Ehrnroth stresses the importance of maintaining a stable 
currency and a low interest rate also on a longer-term basis. 
<H5>  The Land of Quality Products </H5>
  "Finland should never become a down-market producer because 
of a weaker markka. Our nation can only manage by producing 
high-quality products with a sufficient R&amp;D content. 
  ``These products require markets that are considerably 
greater than Finland's. To maintain our present standard of 
living, we must be able to participate freely in the 
international distribution of work, with our proper sectors, 
where we can continue to develop.'' 
  Ehrnroth thinks there may be a longer-term risk that the 
markka will be revalued if productivity grows rapidly and costs 
are kept under control. 
  "The development of the markka depends to a large extent on 
these factors. There is currently no great danger that the 
markka will grow stronger." 
  Ehrnroth pointed out that the total industrial labor costs 
in 
Finland are about the same as in the Nordic countries, France, 
and the Netherlands. They are clearly higher than those of 
Spain and Portugal, to say nothing of Poland and the East 
European countries.

  [Text] Dollars and 100-crown bills forged in Finland have 
been distributed in Russia via Estonia. Two Finnish men have 
been imprisoned in Estonia on remand for 10 months for 
distributing forged money. They were arrested in southern 
Estonia close to the Russian border in April just under a year 
ago together with two Estonians and a load of forged money. At 
that time the men were carrying 6,500 forged 20-dollar bills as 
well as 48 100-dollar bills. The Finnish police went to Estonia 
to establish that the dollars came from the same series as over 
100 kg of forged dollars previously confiscated in Finland. The 
value of these printed dollars was several million markkas.

  [Text] According to a report received by the Baltic Sea 
Marine Protection Commission, at least 40,000 tonnes of chemical 
weapons and ammunition from World War II were dumped into the 
Baltic Sea. Approximately 13,000 tonnes of this is war 
chemicals. The dumping continued until the end of 1947. In 
addition, the former East Germany dumped 200 tonnes of 
ammunition in the Baltic Sea during the 1950's. The Protection 
Commission is still awaiting more information from Russia about 
the destruction of chemical weapons. According to the report, 
known dumping sites in the Baltic Sea are situated on the 
southeastern side of Gotland, on the eastern side of Bornholm, 
and in the Little Belt in the Danish straits. The report urges 
the Protection Commission to issue general rules for fishermen 
in case chemical weapons get entangled in their catching 
equipment.

<F P=106> [Article by Rolf L. Larsen] </F>
  [Excerpts] "The Chernobyl accident has had greater 
consequences for Norway than at first anticipated," Per Strand, 
a researcher at the National Radiation Protection Board said. 
  "The effects of the radioactive fallout will last longer, 
and 
a larger amount of radioactive substances will be absorbed by 
vegetation and animals in the vulnerable outlying grazing 
grounds than we estimated in 1986," the researcher said. 
[passage omitted] 
  ``The authorities have set an upper limit for the amount of 
radiation permitted in foodstuffs before they take special 
measures. Foodstuffs produced in some of the heavily polluted 
outlying areas will register above the limit well into the next 
century unless we continue our special countermeasures,'' Strand 
said. 
<H5>  Information </H5>
  One of the measures has been to provide information to 
segments of the population that are subject to serious exposure 
about how often they can eat reindeer meat, freshwater fish, or 
game from the affected areas. Another measure has been to give a 
substance that binds cesium to animals that have grazed in these 
areas or to put the animals on nonradioactive feed for a while 
before they are slaughtered. 
  "The level of radiation, and consequently the health risks, 
have been significantly reduced because of these measures. For 
the population as a whole, the risk has been halved. For 
reindeer-herding Samis in south and central Norway the risk has 
been reduced to one-tenth. The Chernobyl incident means a very 
slight increase in cancer risk for the population, but those 
groups that eat a lot of reindeer meat, freshwater fish, or 
mushrooms from the areas that experienced great radioactive 
fallout will have an increased risk of cancer if countermeasures 
are not taken. This applies above all to Samis that are reindeer 
herders. With the use of countermeasures it is expected that one 
in 1,000 in this group will develop cancer. Without 
countermeasures, the number would be one in 100." 
<H5>  500 Cancer Cases </H5>
  "It is estimated that about 500 Norwegians will develop 
cancer in the next 50 years as a result of the radiation from 
Chernobyl. (Annually 10,000 Norwegians die of cancer stemming 
from other causes.) We might expect 80-90 cases of genetic 
damage in Norway. There has not been any increase in reports of 
fetal damage in Norway, but a small increase in spontaneous 
abortions was recorded shortly after the accident," Strand said.

  [Text] Taiwan has expelled four refugees from the People's 
Republic of China to Sweden. All four are reported to have 
taken part in the democracy movement and are expected at Arlanda 
[airport] this evening. The reason why Taiwan is expelling the 
four Chinese is that one or more of them are reported to have 
relatives in Sweden. In the past, refugees from the People's 
Republic have been allowed to stay in Taiwan, but as the 
relations between the two countries have improved, interest in 
the refugees has lessened in Taiwan.

<F P=106> [Mikael Holmstrom report: "Government and `No' Side in </F>
Agreement"] 
  [Text] The referendum on EU [European Union] membership 
could be held as early as Sunday, 19 June. This is the most 
likely date at present. The alternative would be to wait until 
March 1995, but this would jeopardize the whole process of 
accession to the EU. 
  This emerged after Saturday's [5 March] meeting between 
Prime 
Minister Bildt and the leaders of the No to the EU campaigns. 
Boths sides were very satisfied with the atmosphere at the 
meeting and the exchange of views. 
  No to the EU would prefer a short campaign with a vote in 
June. 
  "We do not believe that the Swedish people have the same 
burning interest as we do. It is also an issue of democracy, if 
people do not have the energy to involve themselves in the 
debate," Eva-Britt Svensson from No to the EU said, disagreeing 
with those who want to wait until later. 
  Sten Johansson from Social Democrats against the EU prefers 
19 June or March 1995 to the party line of 27 November. A June 
vote would also halt the planned Social Democratic congress on 
the EU on 18-19 June that he calls a "propaganda stunt." 
  Up to this time, the Moderate Coalition Party's position has 
been 18 September -- the same day as the general election -- in 
order to make the referendum binding after changes to the 
Constitution. But as long ago as last fall the prime minister's 
aides were talking about a vote in June, and Carl Bildt is 
seeking a solution that all the parties and campaign leaderships 
"can live with." At present most things point to 19 June. 
  The prime minister who met the party leaders last Friday 
will 
discuss the matter with them again on Thursday but does not 
think that it will be possible to reach agreement. He was 
cautious in his comments on Saturday, but it was clear that he 
is not happy about Ingvar Carlsson's proposal of 27 November. 
  "You meet very very few people who think that November is a 
good time. I have really only met one." 
  Carl Bildt and European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel 
stressed that they have long been the only people who assumed 
that there would be a full agreement with the EU on 1 March. 
The Social Democrats did not expect an agreement before this 
summer at the earliest or until after the election this fall. 
In the new situation they and the other parties must have time 
for "dialogue and reflection," at most up to the beginning of 
April. 
  If it proves impossible to agree on 19 June as the date for 
a 
referendum, March 1995 appears to be the main alternative for a 
number of domestic political reasons -- the election campaign, 
the formation of a government, and the work on the budget. But 
this would make the agreed date for EU entry -- 1 January 1995 
-- impossible and would therefore require renegotiation with the 
EU and this could wreck and halt the entry of all four countries. 
  The government and the no side have agreed on two voting 
slips. 
  "Our demand was that there be a democratic and fair vote 
involving two lines: yes or no to membership of the EU," said 
Hans Lindqvist from No to the EU. 
  "The one alternative is yes to membership as it is defined 
in 
the agreement, the other is no," Carl Bildt said. If the 
Swedish people say no he does not think that there will be a new 
referendum on a new agreement, as in Denmark after Maastricht: 
  "That possibility does not exist; the agreement is between 
us 
and 12 other countries. Regardless what sort of somersaults 
Swedish politicians might be willing to do, 12 other governments 
would never agree. If there is a no to this agreement, this 
will mean no to membership for the foreseeable future," Carl 
Bildt said. 
  The government will make information available to the public 
and each side could receive around 25 million kronor for its 
campaign.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mr. Leotard Criticizes Mr. </F>
Mitterrand's Suggestions on M-5 Nuclear Missile Programs"] 
  [Text] On Thursday, 3 March, Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard spoke before the National Assembly Finance Committee in 
a public session. He stated that the wish to adapt the TN-75 
missile warhead (already in use on the current M-45 missile) to 
the future M-5 submarine missile and the wish to produce a 
land-based version, christened the S-5, for the Albion platform 
silos, would be decisions entailing "unreasonable costs." By 
saying this, Mr. Leotard indirectly criticized a wish expressed 
by the head of state in a recent interview with AFP and which he 
repeated, with a vigor that surprised his listeners, at the 
meeting of the Defense Council on 16 February. 
  Mr. Leotard stressed: "If we are to implement the M-5 
nuclear missile program, we need to carry out tests to develop 
the new TN-100 warhead (which was originally intended for it)." 
Replying to former (Socialist) Defense Minister Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement, who asked him about the possibility of equipping 
the M-5 missile with the TN-75 nuclear warhead which currently 
arms the existing M-45 submarine missiles, Mr. Leotard said: 
"That would be unreasonably expensive." He continued: 
"Adapting the M-5 to the Albion platform in its land-based 
version named S-5 would also incur unreasonable costs." 
  Much heavier than the current S-3D missiles equipping the 
Albion platform, the M-5 missile and its land-based derivative, 
the S-5, would mean restructuring the underground silos. The 
TN-100 warhead has the dual advantage of being smaller and more 
"stealthy" than the TN-75. It is known that Rally for the 
Republic President Jacques Chirac is in favor of the M-5 program 
and of restarting tests to perfect the new nuclear warhead. 
<H5>  Mastering `Simulation' </H5>
  Moreover, Mr. Leotard stated that the M-5 program was begun 
early, "in 1992 instead of in 1995" by former Defense Minister 
Pierre Joxe, and that "we must return to a more normal rate of 
progression for this program." He continued by saying that, as 
indicated in the white paper for defense, "nuclear modernization 
has been placed on temporary hold," but that an "unprecedented" 
budgetary effort is being made with a view to the development of 
nuclear test simulation technologies, with 1994 funding 
amounting to 280 million French francs [Fr]. Mr. Leotard 
stated: "This amount should double" in the 1995-2000 military 
programming law, enabling France to acquire the simulation 
capacities enjoyed by the Americans "in nine or 10 years' time." 
  The defense minister pointed out: "In no way is the existing 
French deterrent threatened by the moratorium imposed on nuclear 
tests," which remain necessary "to acquire this simulation 
capacity." He thus indicated that the future military 
programming law would take this fact into consideration. He 
also stated that the renewal of the nonproliferation treaty in 
1995 does not pose any particular problems for France, which 
will sign it. On the other hand, he reminded the committee that 
France would only approve the total test ban treaty, currently 
being negotiated in Geneva and which the Americans would like to 
see concluded in 1996, "if France masters the capacity for 
simulation." 
<H5>  Maintaining the Level of Equipment Credits </H5>
  In addition, the minister expressed his wish to see 
"equipment credits maintained or increased in constant franc 
terms" in the next five-year programming law. "The chosen base 
is Fr100.4 billion," i.e., an initial sum equal to equipment 
credits granted in 1994. 
  The budget for the military programming law is currently 
being studied by the government. It should have been submitted 
to the Defense Council on 16 February, but was not because the 
prime minister's final arbitration had not yet been received. 
Mr.Mitterrand is demanding that the final project be submitted 
by the end of March. Within the government, discussions have 
run into difficulties concerning the annual rate of increase of 
defense credits before inflation. 
  The defense minister envisages a rise of 2.5 to 3 percent, 
which would still mean sacrificing certain arms programs 
(reducing orders, spreading orders over time, or even radically 
abandoning whole projects). The budget minister, who must 
operate within the limits of the law controlling public 
expenditure passed by Parliament at the end of 1993, refused to 
depart from the rule whereby all state expenditure must be 
reduced by an average of 0.5 percent over the next few years. 
  Lastly, Mr. Leotard stated, for the first time, that the 
cost 
of each Rafale fighter aircraft would be Fr315 million 
unequipped and Fr588 million fully armed and with all spare 
parts and regular maintenance included.

France," compared with 61 percent in the previous poll. 
Forty-three percent (an increase of 6 percent) do not trust him. 
  The head of state has the confidence of 40 percent (as 
against 38 percent previously), whereas 57 percent (down 3 
percent) of people questioned say they do not have confidence in 
him. Fifty-eight percent want the current prime minister "to 
play an important role in the coming months." Despite a drop of 
5 percent, Mr. Balladur is still ahead of other prominent 
right-wing figures -- Charles Pasqua (51 percent, down 3 
percent), Simone Veil (50 percent, up 1 percent). Jacques 
Chirac remains stable at 37 percent, Raymond Barre drops 2 
percent to 36 percent, and Valery Giscard d'Estaing goes up 1 
percent to 27 percent. 
  On the Left, Jacques Delors remains in the lead with 55 
percent (up 2 percent) of people questioned wanting him to play 
"an important role," ahead of Jack Lang (47 percent) and Michel 
Rocard (38 percent) who both remain stable. 
  This opinion poll was carried out from 19 through 23 
February 
on a national sample of 1,000 representative members of the

  [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- The French Government 
announced Wednesday [9 March] that the insurance group 
Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and computer giant Bull 
were the next state companies in line for privatization. 
  But the decree announcing the sell-offs made no mention of a 
privatization date for vehicle maker Renault, giving weight to 
reports that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur planned to delay 
that highly-symbolic sale until after next year's presidential 
elections. 
  The decree, signed by Balladur and Economy Minister Edmond 
Alphandery and published Wednesday in the official gazette, 
provided no details of the timing or procedures for shedding the 
government's majority holdings in the two companies. 
  A statement released by the Economy Ministry said that the 
sale of the loss-making Bull would probably take place in 
several steps, but gave no details on how the government share 
in the company would be placed in private hands. 
  It said the government's holding in AGF would involve 
selling 
state-held shares on the stock market. 
  Alphandery was scheduled to give a press conference later 
Wednesday morning to discuss details of the privatization. 
  Industry Minister Gerard Longuet has repeatedly said that 
Renault should be privatized by the end of this year. But 
Balladur is reportedly concerned about the potential political 
fall-out from the sale, which is strongly opposed by the 
communist-led CGT [General Labor Confederation] union which 
represents most Renault workers. 
  The government has already privatized the BNP [National Bank 
of Paris], Rhone-Poulenc chemical group and oil firm 
Elf-Aquitaine. 
  After Wednesday's announcement, 16 firms remain on the 
government's sell-off list, including Renault. 
  The French economy minister later said the government would 
take "whatever time we need" to privatize the computer firm 
Bull, in an interview Wednesday morning on French radio. 
  He said the sell-off of Bull was not designed to "fill up 
state coffers. This is not our aim." 
  "Bull must leave the state's embrace and learn to fly on its 
own wings," Alphandery said. 
  "Naturally, we will take whatever time we need to carry out 
this privatization," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Christophe Palierse and Olivier Provost: "A </F>
French-German Quartet for the Future Armored Vehicle"] 
  [Text] According to a memorandum from an industrial source 
involved with the modular armored vehicle (VBM) project, "by 
June 1994, one or more companies will be created, bringing 
together Giat Industries, Krauss Maffei, Mercedes-Benz, and 
Panhard." At the next "Eurosatory" ground defense equipment 
fair to be held in June, "the Mercedes EXF and the Vextra will 
be on display on a specific stand bearing the name of one of the 
companies." These models will be the concrete implementation of 
the French and German proposals, but we will also see "a central 
model of the joint EVA [expansion unknown] concept proposed by 
the industrial groups." 
  For the time being, Giat Industries has refused to comment 
on 
the subject. However, at the Defense Ministry, the contents of 
this memo, although considered to be "confidential," were 
confirmed. It is up to the Germans, probably in the first 
quarter of 1994, to validate the technical choices and in 
particular to choose between a wheeled armored vehicle (the 
solution felt to be most likely) proposed by Krauss Maffei, MAK 
[Kiel Machine-Building Company], and perhaps Wegmann; and a more 
conventional tracked vehicle as Thyssen is said to be proposing 
with the TH-495. Since Mercedes originated the project and the 
design for the wheeled vehicle but is not scheduled to produce 
it, Bonn will have to choose a company to act as prime 
contractor. Krauss Maffei is the clear favorite, giving rise to 
the four-party solution mentioned in the confidential memo. 
<H5>  `Very Active Support' of Paris and Bonn </H5>
  The joint EVA design to be presented in June at Eurosatory 
will not perhaps have been officially validated, but will 
benefit from the "very active support" of Paris and Bonn. The 
Defense Ministry states that the first version of the modular 
armored vehicle should be a six-wheel drive (a six-by-six) 
weighing approximately 24 to 25 tonnes and bearing 9 tonnes per 
axle. This would make it possible to produce a 36-tonne 
eight-wheeler. The basic versions will be in troop transporter 
and command post configurations. France also envisages a direct 
support vehicle with a turret and a 45-mm gun, and a weapons 
system carrier with, among the options, a 120-mm gun. Initially, 
the Germans want to configure it as a repair, ambulance, 
transmission, and observation vehicle. 
  The French plan to put 3,000 vehicles into service to 
replace 
-- given the recent reductions in army hardware -- the existing 
4,000 front-armored vehicles, the 900 AMX personnel carriers, 
and the 325 AMX 10 RC's [expansion unknown]. Germany should 
also purchase 3,000 VBM's, although it has only included 800 in 
its future planning. The cost per vehicle remains fixed at 5 
million French francs [Fr] excluding tax. Development costs are 
estimated at between Fr800 and Fr900 million. This represents a 
reasonable level of expenditure -- development will continue 
from 1996 to 2000, with the first mass-produced vehicle planned 
for the end of 2002 -- which justifies, according to a source 
close to the project, "the correct place" given to the VBM in 
the upcoming French military programming law for 1995 to 2000, 
which proves so difficult to complete.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Judge Jean-Pierre's `Anticriminal </F>
Networks' Operation"] 
  [Text] "The situation is serious and it has taken the 
assassination of Deputy Yann Piat for any sign of indignation to 
be shown." Yesterday, Judge Thierry Jean-Pierre, who on 3 
December was entrusted with the organized crime issue, submitted 
his initial proposals to the Justice Ministry for carrying out 
"operation criminal networks." 
  Thierry Jean-Pierre feels that "France is behind in the 
fight 
because there is no Mafia phenomenon proper, as is the case in 
Italy. The problem here is that information does not circulate 
well and is neither confirmed nor analyzed." In his "progress 
report" submitted to the ministry late last week, the judge 
advocates setting up 11 jurisdictions specializing in matters of 
major financial criminality -- suspect dealings, corruption, 
moneylaundering, misuse of company property -- organized into 
networks, like the Mafia. The cities in question would be 
Paris, Versailles, Lille, Rennes, Toulouse, Bordeaux, 
Montpellier, Marseilles, Lyons, Strasbourg, and Orleans. 
  He also suggests creating a "Organized Crime Suppression 
Squad" (BRREC) comprising policemen, gendarmes, and customs 
officers which would carry out investigations on the basis of 
"one team, one objective, one budget." In addition, he feels 
that all intelligence could be centralized in a "Crime Research 
and Investigation Department" (DEESC). 
  Lastly, the judge puts forward the idea of being able to 
reverse the burden of proof, an audacious move in French law. 
Someone with a dubious fortune would have to prove the legal 
origin of the funds, whereas at present it is the justice system 
that has to prove that they were illegally earned. "But this 
idea is just a proposal," Thierry Jean-Pierre assured. 
  Thierry Jean-Pierre estimates that the whole system will 
need 
a budget of 20 million francs [Fr]. "That is not much," he 
concludes, "in view of the Fr20 billion in sales made through 
narcotics trafficking in France." 
  Several organizations are already in place for fighting 
financial criminality. Yesterday, the judge refused to go into 
the delicate matter of whether these would be kept in place. 
Nevertheless, his report is particularly harsh on one of them, 
the Central Service for the Prevention of Corruption (SCPC), 
which was set up in January 1993 when Michel Vauzelle was 
minister of justice. The SCPC's current secretary general, 
Pierre-Antoine Lorenzi, was Mr. Vauzelle's head of staff. In 
December, Mr. Lorenzi publicly questioned the appointment of the 
"paradox" Thierry Jean-Pierre. Reliable sources say that the 
judge concluded his report, in substance, by saying that the 
SCPC "is operating in an illegal manner by carrying out 
investigations without being entitled to do so and by keeping 
the results for itself instead of forwarding them to the public 
prosecutor's office." 
  On the other hand, the judge is said to feel that the 
Central 
Office for the Suppression of Major Financial Criminality 
(OCRGDF) must be maintained, as well as the AntiMafia 
Intelligence Unit (URCRAM), both of which are answerable to the 
Interior Ministry. The Finance Ministry's TRACFIN [group 
specializing in intelligence and operations against underground 
financial networks], however, could be incorporated into the 
DEESC. 
  Thierry Jean-Pierre plans to hand in a second interim report 
in June, and the final report in September, so that any bill 
that might arise from it could be put on the agenda of the fall 
session of Parliament.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Charles Lambroschini: "Caesar and His Wife"] </F>
  [Text] Bill Clinton has reason to be worried. The 
President is in a bad situation because THE NEW YORK TIMES is 
already comparing his attitude in the Whitewater case to that of 
Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. 
  It is a significant parallel. It is not so much the 
seriousness of the initial issue for which the White House is 
blamed, but for its attempt to stifle it, according to the press 
and the Republican opposition. This is a suspicion which the 
weekend's escalation seems to confirm: The summoning by a grand 
jury of six senior presidential officials, the most important of 
whom, White House legal adviser Bernard Nussbaum, immediately 
announced his resignation. 
  At first, Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, and his 
wife Hillary, then a well-known lawyer, had merely been the 
victims of the failure of a private investment. The property 
deal in which they were involved in 1978 with the McDougals, a 
couple they were friendly with, resulted in a resounding 
failure. But, now, the aim is to determine whether public funds 
intended to put a savings bank owned by the McDougals back on a 
sound financial footing were misappropriated to save the 
Whitewater development. Or, even more embarrassingly, whether 
they were used to fund the Clinton campaign for reelection as 
governor of Arkansas. 
  It seems that truth is stranger than fiction, and the case 
has been complicated by all the sudden developments of a 
television soap. Last year, the suicide of Vincent Foster, 
Nussbaum's assistant at the White House, remained unexplained. 
We now learn that, after the death of its former colleague, the 
law office where Foster had worked with Hillary hurriedly 
destroyed the files left by that unfortunate man. 
  The public has remained largely indifferent. The subject, 
which justified the appointment of a special prosecutor, is 
apparently too complex for Americans to show an interest. 
Optimistic because of the economic recovery which is growing 
stronger, they have given Bill Clinton the highest level of 
support since he entered the White House in January 1992. 
According to an opinion poll published by THE WASHINGTON POST 
last week, 58 percent of the respondents said they are satisfied. 
  But Richard Nixon also thought he could overcome the 
obstacle. Five months after the burglary of the Democratic Party 
Headquarters in the Watergate Building, he was reelected in a 
landslide to the White House in November 1972. And yet, the 
repercussions of the scandal forced him to resign two years 
before the end of his term. 
  Conversely, Ronald Reagan survived the incredible scenario 
concocted by his advisers: The money paid by the Iranian 
mullahs for the clandestine purchase of American weapons funded 
the antiSandinista guerrilla war in Nicaragua. But the former 
actor had such an ability to extricate himself from political 
problems that he deserved the nickname "Teflon President." 
  Bill Clinton has two problems. In his case it is not just 
Caesar who must show himself to be above suspicion, but also 
Caesar's wife.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Normandy Without Kohl"] </F>
  [Text] Helmut Kohl will not be among those present at Omaha 
Beach on 6 June, much to his great displeasure. The 
chancellor's participation in the celebrations of the 50th 
anniversary of the Normandy landings, together with Francois 
Mitterrand, Bill Clinton, and the Queen of England, would have 
been the pinnacle of his career as a statesman and, moreover, 
would have been of considerable help in a decisive electoral 
year. 
  We remember the emotion of 22 September 1984 when the French 
president and the German chancellor paid their respects 
hand-in-hand before the Verdun war memorial. This symbolic 
gesture was a prelude to the strengthening of Franco-German 
cooperation and a boost for European unity that culminated in 
the Maastricht Treaty. Ten years later, in a world turned 
upside down, a unified and sovereign Germany was shocked to find 
itself excluded from the ceremonies of 6 June and has voiced its 
displeasure, if we are to believe the daily newspaper 
FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, by asking its diplomats to withdraw from 
any ceremony related with the event. 
  The affair is obviously a delicate one. What is being 
celebrated on Omaha Beach is the fraternity of the allied armies 
which managed, at an immense cost in human lives, to begin to 
win back the land held by the Nazis. It is not, as was the case 
at Verdun, a shared homage to the war dead. Neither is this 
celebration a private affair between the French and the Germans. 
It is not certain whether the British would have appreciated 
seeing yesterday's enemy treated on the same level as the 
allies. Therein lies the whole ambiguity of the celebration of 
the battles -- it is unlikely that next year Francois Mitterrand 
and the Queen of England will celebrate the 180th anniversary of 
the Battle of Waterloo. If we had wanted to stress the 
reconciliation of yesterday's enemies, the Normandy ceremonies 
ought to have been a purely military affair, a reunion of 
comrades in arms who had lived through a terrible event 
together. The capitulation of Nazi Germany and the great 
political show of remembrance should have been left to the 
following year. Perhaps there has been an error of "mistaken 
scenario" for which the French president should take the blame. 
  The task of the French leadership would perhaps have been 
made easier if, on several occasions, Chancellor Kohl had given 
less cause for criticism: From the visit of Ronald Reagan to 
the Bitburg cemetery in 1985 to last year's inauguration in 
Berlin of a plaque dedicated to the memory of "all the victims" 
of World War II, he has showed that he sometimes confuses -- for 
reasons of domestic politics -- reconciliation and the assigning 
of responsibility.

  [Text] Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on Cyprus who is in Nicosia, today began contacts in 
the third round of the proximity talks on the 
confidence-building measures. This morning Lamb had a one-hour 
meeting with President Glavkos Kliridhis. Lamb described the 
meeting with Kliridhis as a very useful one during which they 
discussed details related to the current phase of the talks. 
  Asked whether he brings new ideas, Lamb said that the United 
Nations is working hard to make sure that the interests of both 
sides are protected. I do not think, he said, that there is a 
need for new ideas at the present stage. The U.S. special 
coordinator said that he repeated to President Kliridhis the US 
conviction that the confidence-building measures are positive 
and useful and create the opportunity for progress. 
  Replying to other questions, Lamb said that during this 
current phase the two sides will voice their doubts on how the 
issues of Famagusta and Nicosia Airport will work out. He 
described the reservations expressed as logical. He said that 
the process is difficult but very important. Lamb also stressed 
that there is a lot of skepticism on both sides as to whether 
the other side is willing to proceed. However, he added, the 
leadership of both sides have enough perception to be able to 
see that these efforts can lead to an acceptable final 
settlement.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has said 
that the Cyprus Government is evaluating the UN secretary 
general's report, the first part of which describes the 
developments since his last report, issued on 22 November 1993. 
In the second part of his report, Kasoulidhis added, the 
secretary general proceeds with an analysis of the problems that 
have arisen and the key points of which should be agreed upon by 
both sides, as they constitute the substance of the current 
phase of the proximity talks on the confidence-building 
measures. The government spokesman said that the UN 
Secretariat's approach is evident on some issues. Our side, has 
outlined its views, he continued, and it reserves the right to 
agree or disagree at the negotiating table. Kasoulidhis said 
that in the third part of the report the UN secretary general 
presents some notes related with the way the proximity talks 
will proceed starting tomorrow, the logical timeframe for 
expanding the talks, and the importance he attaches to the 
prospect of concluding an agreement, or not. 
  Asked to comment on an observation that the secretary 
general's report takes a clear stance on issues about which our 
side has expressed disagreement, especially on the issues of 
turning over sovereignty over Nicosia International Airport and 
free use of it by Turkish Cypriots with their own travel 
documents, the spokesman said that he can not comment on issues 
under discussion at the negotiating table. Kasoulidhis added 
that our side sees in the report some approaches by the 
secretary general that are closer to our side and others that 
differ from our side's positions. Replying to a question, the 
spokesman said setting the end of March as the timeframe is 
reasonable to reach agreements on the seven major issues.

<F P=106> [Report by Foivos Karzis] </F>
  [Text] Good evening from the Presidential Palace where 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is now meeting U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Steven Oxman, who arrived in Athens at noon 
today. 
  Oxman had two consecutive meetings with Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yeoryios Papandreou this afternoon. They met at the 
U.S. Embassy building first and then at the Foreign Ministry. 
During his talks with the Greek political leadership, Oxman 
will mainly discuss Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia], but will also cover the entire spectrum of Balkan 
problems. He will also discuss Cyprus, because Washington is 
particularly interested in promoting the confidence-building 
measures. 
  In statements made a short time ago at the Foreign Ministry, 
Papandreou and Oxman noted that the upcoming meeting between 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and international mediator 
Cyrus Vance is particularly critical. They both said that this 
meeting will determine the course of developments. It was 
indicative that when referring to the Greek measures against 
Skopje, Oxman exuded an atmosphere that was completely different 
from the European Union, which intensely pressures Athens. 
Oxman said that Washington is really interested in a swift 
lifting of the Greek measures, but that he had received 
explanations of the reasons that led to the adoption of these 
measures. He said Washington is interested helping to restore 
communications between Athens and Skopje and meeting the 
prerequisites leading to a preliminary agreement to resume the 
talks. 
  Arriving at Ellinikon Airport at noon today, Oxman made it 
clear that Washington has no prepared solutions, but wants to 
facilitate talks between the two sides. Oxman said: 
  [Begin Oxman recording in English] We will certainly be 
discussing that issue, and I look forward to it. Our role is to 
try to be helpful in this situation. I am not bringing some 
made-in-American solution. We want to be helpful; we want to 
support the efforts of the United Nations, of Cyrus Vance. We 
would like to see the situation resolved as promptly as possible 
in the interest of regional stability, so that will be one of 
the topics among others that we will be discussing. [end 
recording] 
  Oxman will leave for Ankara tomorrow morning, where he said 
he will discuss many issues, including the Balkans, 
Greek-Turkish relations, and the operation for assisting 
Kurdistan that is organized jointly by the United States, 
Britain, and France. It will be a visit of particular interest.

  [Text] Turkey and the Russian Federation will cooperate on 
the transfer of advanced technology. The memorandum on the 
first meeting of the Turkey-Russia Working Group on Industrial 
Cooperation and the Transfer of Advanced Technology, which was 
held in Ankara in December 1993, has been published in the 
Official Gazette. According to the memorandum, Turkey and Russia 
have agreed to implement the project for a submerged optical 
cable between Turkey, Ukraine, and Russia in 1995. Meanwhile, 
the NETAS [Northern Electric Telecommunications] Corporation 
will cooperate with two of Russia's telecommunication firms to 
establish joint installations for the production and sale of 
telecommunications equipment and power systems. 
  The agreement between the two sides called for cooperation 
to 
modernize Russia's refineries and noted that cooperation between 
Turkey and Russia in Russia's civilian conversion of its 
military installations will be useful. 
  Meanwhile, the Council of Ministers has approved the 
friendship and cooperation agreement between Turkey and Ukraine 
that was reached in Ankara in May 1992. It has also been 
published in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers has decided to complete 
work on the bill amending the law governing the civil servants 
unions and their right to sign collective wage agreements and 
stage strikes and to give it its final form. The Council of 
Ministers also debated a bill that amends the Central Bank Law 
by reducing the amount of credit the bank can extend to the 
Treasury and to the public sector. 
  The Council of Ministers met under Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller for two and a half hours last night. After the meeting, 
State Minister Aykon Dogan made a statement on the issues 
discussed. He pointed out that the Council of Ministers debated 
a bill drafted by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security 
amending the law on civil servants unions and on their right to 
sign collective wage agreements and stage strikes. He said that 
the Council of Ministers decided to give the bill its final form 
at the next meeting and to conclude the work on the bill. 
  Dogan said that the Council of Ministers also discussed a 
bill that amends the Central Bank Law by reducing the amount of 
short- term advance loans the bank can extend to the Treasury, 
as well as the amount of credit it can extend to the public 
sector. He stressed that this bill is a very serious step 
toward a situation in which public financing is conducted by 
secure sources outside the Central Bank. In this way, he said, 
the Turkish lira will eventually become a currency that is 
sought after once again. 
  Dogan stated that the Council of Ministers also debated 
decrees aiming at increasing exports and increasing foreign 
exchange revenues and opened them to signature. He explained 
that the decrees invoke measures by which exports will be 
supported more strongly and systematically within the general 
rules of GATT and international trade. 
  The state minister pointed out that the Council of Ministers 
also decided that the new financial sources needed by the 
commercial sector will be allotted to Eximbank. With this 
decision, Dogan said, exports are expected to gain a new 
dynamism in the coming season. 
  Aykon Dogan stated that $17.5 billion are expected in export 
revenues in 1994. Next year, he added, this will cover the 
current accounts deficit, which is more than $5 billion this 
year. 
  The state minister also announced that the Council of 
Ministers decided to reduce the value added tax on hotel and 
restaurant services in tourist installations, except for 
nightclubs and bars, from 23 percent to 15 percent.

  [Text] Ankara--Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's hopes of 
creating the best possible inflation picture before the March 27 
local polls faded on Friday [4 March] when official figures 
announced an inflation rate higher than all rates during the 
1989-1992 period. Since 1992, there have been only five annual 
rates higher than February's 73 percent consumer inflation rate. 
  There were reports on Friday that a monetary crisis in 
mid-January lifted Turkey's February inflation rate to 73 
percent, the highest since last July. 
  The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) revealed Friday that 
consumer prices shot up 6 percent in February to bring the 
annual inflation figure to 73 percent following a 13.6 percent 
lira devaluation on Jan. 26. 
  Consumer prices had risen 4.4 percent in January when 
year-on-year inflation stood at 69.6 percent, and 3.6 percent 
last December when the year-end figure was 71.1 percent. The 
wholesale price index soared 10.1 percent in February, the 
highest since January 1992 and almost doubling the 5.3 percent 
figure for January. The 12-month rate rose to 68 percent from 
60.6 in January. 
  A run on the lira from mid-January has caused turbulence in 
financial markets and rapid depreciation of the lira. Shortly 
after the Jan. 26 devaluation, the government launched a wave of 
price hikes, which were followed by several price makers in the 
private sector. 
  In the aftermath of the crisis, economists and observers 
widely expected a substantial increase in price levels but Prime 
Minister Ciller denied this. 
  "The impact of devaluation on the general level of prices 
will not be as strong as they claim. During the whole year, 
there will be an increase of about 3 to 4 percentage points in 
the inflation rate due to the devaluation," she said in a recent 
statement. 
  But financial analysts predict an even higher rate in March. 
They reason that several retailers have implemented massive 
price hikes since the end of February and beginning of March. 
"The damage, spilling over from higher prices in the government 
sector, will be felt more clearly during March," said one 
economist. 
  The announcement of March figures on April 4 will come after 
the election period. 
  Economists pointed out that there was a reverse occurrence 
of 
wholesale and retail figures in February, supporting 
expectations of a bleaker inflation picture for March. "The 
general tendency is that retail prices rise faster than 
wholesale prices. In February the situation was reversed. This 
was because several retailers were not too quick to respond to 
changes in wholesale prices," explained one economist. In a 
related development, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ITO) 
announced that its own price indices for February produced a 
year-on-year consumer inflation rate of 73.7 percent, only a 
slight 0.7 percentile up on the DIE figure. ITO said retail 
prices in February rose by 9 percent. Observers say Ciller's 
failure to defeat rampant inflation, a promise made several 
months ago, has significantly lowered her True Path Party's 
(DYP) popularity and has jeopardized her election chances.

<F P=106> [Serif Sayin report: "Belgium Protests Against Lifting of </F>
the Immunity of Democracy Party Deputies"] 
  [Text] Belgium has lodged an official protest against the 
lifting of the legislative immunity of the Democracy Party 
deputies. However, Turkey has rejected the protest and drew the 
attention of the Brussels Government to the preparations made 
for the Kurdistan Conference in that city on 12-13 March. The 
venue of the conference is in an area where many Turks live. 
Belgium's protest was conveyed by the director of the Belgian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Political Department to Yildirim 
Kesin, Turkey's ambassador in Brussels. Keskin recalled that 
the decision to lift the immunity of the Democracy Party 
deputies was made by the Turkish Grand National Assembly and 
stressed that the Turkish Government does not have the right to 
interfere in the decisions of the legislative organ, as is the 
case in all countries ruled in accordance with the principles of 
democracy. 
  According to officials affiliated with the Belgian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, Keskin also recalled a similar situation in 
that country and rejected Brussels' protest note. 
  Keskin also drew the Brussels Government's attention to the 
preparations that are being made to hold the "International 
Conference on Northwestern Kurdistan" in that city on 12-13 
March. He said: "The conference, which will be held in a hotel 
some 200 meters from the Turkish quarter of the city, can only 
be described as a provocation. Considering the fact that the 
Brussels Government has approved the conference, it will be held 
responsible for this provocative activity." 
  Meanwhile, the HURRIYET office in Ankara has reported that 
Ingela Martensan, a deputy of the Liberal Party in Sweden, has 
arrived in Turkey to follow the preparations being made for the 
local elections. Although Martensan does not have any official 
capacity, she has criticized the election law and visited the 
Democracy Party General Headquarters, which was damaged by 
explosives some time ago.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Jose Faura Martin, the </F>
Spanish Army chief of staff, by announcer Angela Nunez; Martin 
is at Spanish blue helmets headquarters in Medjurgorje -- live] 
  [Text] [Nunez] We are in contact with Lieutenant General 
Jose Faura Martin at the Spanish blue helmets headquarters in 
Medjugorje. Lieutenant General Jose Faura Martin, good evening. 
  [Martin] Good evening. 
  [Nunez] You took over the job of Army chief of staff 20 days 
ago, and since then you have wanted to visit the Spanish blue 
helmets and the area where they are deployed. You have visited 
them on the day a Spanish military plane was hit by antiaircraft 
fire over the Krajina region. How do you evaluate this incident? 
  [Martin] I think that it is an isolated incident because the 
situation here -- as far as I have seen it -- is fairly calm and 
under control, all things considered. 
  That said, I think that such acts will not be avoidable for 
some time. And these acts cast a shadow on the peace and calm 
for which we are aiming. But I do not think it should be taken 
too seriously. 
  [Nunez] So, apart from these isolated incidents, your 
assessment of how the conflict is evolving is positive? 
  [Martin] In the area I have seen, yes. That is where the 
Spanish battalion is, yes, definitively yes. It is going well, 
very well. 
  [Nunez] Would you say there is reason to hope for peace 
soon? 
  [Martin] Yes, I think so. If it continues to go, as up until 
now, since the signing of the agreement, yes. One sees more 
normal life in the cities. Your colleague has said there were 
trams running in Sarajevo for the first time today. This means 
life is returning to normal in the area. 
  [Nunez] You mention the normalization of the conflict but it 
also means our blue helmets have more work to do. The defense 
minister said they are working to 100 percent of their capacity. 
  [Martin] That is true. Now that the Neretva route is opened 
-- that is the one we control -- the number of convoys is up, 
missions have been increased, and so our men are working to the 
hilt. Despite this, they are all in good spirits, morale is 
good, and the atmosphere in this Spanish unit is magnificent. 
  [Nunez] The blue helmets have more work, does this mean that 
they are more at risk? 
  [Martin] No, no, I think the risk has diminished. There is 
more work but there is less risk. 
  [Nunez] Mr. Faura, the defense minister has said that a 
small 
additional contingent -- about 100 men -- might be sent to the 
area where our blue helmets are deployed. Considering the 
situation on the ground, would this be enough men? 
  [Martin] I do not know, because the decision to send more 
men 
is a political decision in which I have no part. I will report 
back about what I have seen, I will inform the minister, and he 
will make his decision. I can not say right now what he will 
decide to do. 
  [Nunez] Anyway, one can say that there is not only more work 
to be done, but the work is more important. 
  [Martin] No, I would say the work is just as important as 
before but now there is more activity, there are more convoy 
escorts, more checkpoints. There have been new deployments in 
areas where we could not have people before -- this means it is 
safer to have more detachments -- but this does not make our 
mission more important than before. 
  [Nunez] In April, the Madrid Group [name of current Spanish 
blue helmet contingent] will be replaced by the Cordoba Group. 
What will this new contingent find? What will you tell the new 
units that are going to go to the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Martin] I think they will find a completely different 
situation to the one the Madrid Group found on arrival, a calmer 
situation, with maybe new missions, maybe more activities, but 
with less risk. Luckily. 
  [Nunez] Lieutenant General Jose Faura Martin, Army chief of 
staff, thank you for answering the call of Radio Nacional de 
Espana. 
  [Martin] Thank you. Goodnight. 
  [Nunez] Goodnight.

held in Naples from 8 to 10 July. The meeting, unlike past 
ones, will place a greater emphasis on political themes. The 
news was revealed by Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi who 
unveiled the G-7 logo in Naples today. 
  Ciampi stressed that there is no reason to believe that 
there 
will be Russian participation at the heart of G-7. He also made 
it clear that there has been no UN request for Italy to take 
part in operations in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "The Twelve Call For UNPROFOR </F>
Reinforcements"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 7 Mar (BELGA) -- European Union (EU) 
foreign ministers stressed on Monday evening [7 March] the need 
for reinforcements for the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, thus responding favorably to an appeal by 
France. 
  They also stressed the importance of the more active role 
now 
played by the United States and Russia in bringing peace to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, while pointing out that the EU cannot allow 
itself to be reduced to playing an "inferior role," in the words 
of Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, whose country holds 
the EU presidency until 30 June. 
  The Twelve gave their backing to French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe, who had called upon the Twelve and others, notably 
the United States, to send UNPROFOR reinforcements to Bosnia. 
  Mr. Papoulias refused to say, however, if any of them had 
indicated their willingness to participate in the effort deemed 
necessary. His French colleague indicated that France, which 
has the largest contingent of blue helmets in the area, had 
"done its duty." 
  France also called upon its European partners to reintegrate 
the Serbs in the peace process. "You cannot make peace between 
two in a three-sided conflict," said Mr. Juppe, with reference 
to the accord between the Croats and the Muslims on creating a 
federation involving these two sides in Bosnia. 
  He went on to propose a meeting between the Europeans, the 
Russians, and the Americans in order to achieve peace. 
  Mr. Papoulias went no further than to say that the Twelve 
"were interested" in the role played by the United States and 
Russia in the peace process, but still supported the EU's peace 
plan.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ex-Yugoslavia: Operation Sharp </F>
Guard a Success So Far"] 
  [Text] Taranto, 8 Mar (ANSA) -- Since June 15, 1993, no 
cargo ship passing through the lower Adriatic and Otranto 
Channels has been able to violate the United Nations embargo 
against republics of the former Yugoslavia, according to today's 
review of Operation Sharp Guard, carried out by NATO and the 
Western European Union (WEU). 
  The report showed how of the 15,309 ships identified in the 
operation, most in the Otranto Channel or off the coast of 
Montenegro, 1,237 were bordered and inspected while 314 were 
re-routed to Italian ports in the Puglia region for a more 
in-depth inspection. 
  The Operation Sharp Guard report was given here by the 
deputy 
commander of the operation, Italian Admiral Gianfranco Coviello, 
and the commander of WEU naval forces, Rear-Admiral Elio 
Bolongaro, onboard the frigate "Zeffiro." 
  In their report, the commanders underscored how the 
patrolling has interrupted all sea commerce for Montenegro, 
although, Coviello admitted, "we missed a few speedboats which 
could only carry small cargo." 
  Each day an average of 60 ships, excluding ferries, are 
identified by the nine NATO-WEU ships assigned on patrol, out of 
a total fleet of 21 ships. The operation also employs a 
significant number of aircraft in its operations. 
  Once the ships have been identified and, if necessary, 
inspected, as is the case for ships en route to Slovenia or 
Croatia, they are then monitored by radar to verify that they 
arrive at their declared port of destination as stated in the 
ship's manifest. 
  In the event that the final port not be clear or control of 
the cargo difficult, such as with seal containers, then the ship 
is diverted to an Italian port for inspection. 
  It was recalled during today's review how Operation Sharp 
Guard was the consequence of United Nations sanctions with the 
aim of coordinating, under a single command, the parallel 
operation of NATO and the WEU for a better rationalization of 
forces. 
  Of the 21 ships taking part in the operation five are from 
the WEU: the Italian ships "Zeffiro", to be now replaced with 
the frigate "Lupo", and the "Alpino", the "Cataluna" of Spain 
and the French vessels "Cassard" and "D'Estienne D'Orves."

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The United Nations must grasp the current valuable 
opportunity for a ceasefire and peace in Bosnia by sending extra 
peacekeeping troops, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said 
today. 
  The full extent of the willingness of other countries to 
contribute extra forces to peacekeeping operations in the former 
Yugoslavia would become clear within 24 to 48 hours, he said. 
  "Two or three countries have already indicated a very 
positive response which we welcome," said Mr Rifkind. 
  "We will know over the next 24 to 48 hours at most whether 
it 
is a small number of contributors or a wide range." 
  Mr Rifkind was speaking after Sir David Hannay, British 
Ambassador to the United Nations, chaired the first of a series 
of meetings in New York to discuss an urgent UN plea for 10,650 
more men to join the peacekeepers. 
  The British initiative will bring the 19 countries -- mostly 
from Europe but including the United States and Argentina -- 
together for a second informal meeting tomorrow. 
  Mr Rifkind said agreements around Sarajevo, the Croat-Muslim 
ceasefire in central Bosnia and the Serb agreement to reopen 
Tuzla airport were significant changes for the good. 
  "What we may be seeing is a creeping ceasefire," he said. 
  "These changes do represent something quite important and a 
valuable window of opportunity that could lead towards peace in 
Bosnia." 
  He stressed: "We are anxious that this opportunity should 
not be missed. We think it is important that all countries that 
can make an important contribution should, and do so to the 
maximum extent they can." 
  Mr Rifkind said it would not be right for him to identify 
those "two or three" countries willing to contribute. 
  But they are understood to include Turkey, which has so far 
been prohibited from taking part in peacekeeping operations in 
Bosnia because of its extensive historical links with the 
region, which it ruled for centuries under the Ottoman Empire. 
  But officials hope to persuade UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to lift the ban, particularly as Russia -- 
traditional allies with the Serbs -- plans to send more forces. 
  Britain is ready to send a second infantry battalion based 
on 
The Duke of Wellington's Regiment from Tidworth, Wilts., which 
is equipped with 72 Saxon armoured vehicles. 
  The British UN force commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General 
Sir Michael Rose, has warned that ceasefires could collapse 
unless more troops were sent to police front lines. 
  Mr Rifkind said: "We have indicated our willingness to play 
our part. I think there will be a lot of thought being given in 
national capitals today. 
  ``If events of the past few weeks should continue and there 
is an opportunity for achieving peace in Bosnia then the UN and 
member countries will want to play their part in maximising this 
opportunity in bringing it to a satisfactory conclusion.''

<F P=106> ["eli" report: "Lessons From Logistical Problems"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- During its first large-scale mission abroad 
in Somalia, the Bundeswehr had to struggle with considerable 
logistical problems. According to an internal report on the 
experiences of the 3d Corps in Koblenz, there were problems with 
supplies and with the transportation of material both for the 
advance team and for the main contingent of the German unit. In 
addition, the rapporteurs advise against putting together 
foreign contingents from so many different units in the future. 
Such a varied troop could easily get into difficulties in 
critical situations, the report says. 
  According to the 3d Corps, one of the "basic insights" 
gained 
from the Somalia mission is that for future missions "the core 
of an advance team must be kept ready." The personnel must be 
put together and be equipped, ready for action. It must be 
possible to load the equipment into the Bundeswehr transport 
planes ready-packed. Pallets destined for the Somalia mission 
were taken apart and the material was loaded into different 
planes; afterward, it was necessary to put it together "with 
great difficulties and over the course of days." Army beds and 
mosquito nets were missing for days. 
  In addition, the rapporteurs suggest taking loading 
equipment 
-- that is, fork lifts or elevating trucks -- along on the first 
materiel transport. The advance team in Belet Huen would have 
had to unload its equipment with great effort by hand if 
equipment belonging to Canadian units had not been available by 
chance. Furthermore, the 3d Corps writes: "In order to unload 
containers from a ship, one needs container lifters, which are 
to be loaded on the first ship in such a way that they are 
available immediately upon arrival." In addition, because of 
the great number of containers it was impossible to know "where 
which container with what contents was at what time." 
  According to the report, critical situations were "an 
exception at best," also because the entire mission was 
conducted from one base. The unit, which consisted of soldiers 
from more than 200 sections, would have been in much greater 
danger in a critical situation than a unified unit would have 
been. In addition, this variety did "not make" internal 
leadership "easier." Therefore, the 3d Corps suggests using 
"unified and cohesive units" in the future. One must also 
reconsider the command structure, because, as a result of the 
many tasks of the commander, a speedy reaction and command would 
have been "at least doubtful" in critical situations. 
  The 3d Corps stresses that the materiel has proved its 
worth, 
even though "our gun is too heavy because of the amount of 
ammunition that has to be taken along." Independent 
reconnaissance for the Bundeswehr would also have been 
important. For future operations, one must work out a 
reconnaissance concept, which was not possible in Somalia 
because of constitutional restrictions. 
  The report is restrained regarding the political assessment. 
However, it says: "In view of the changed quality of UN 
operations, a clear separation between Chapters VI and VII of 
the UN Charter is no longer possible. The transitions are 
flowing." There is great danger that one has to fulfill one's 
own assignment with military force, and is thus dragged into a 
mission on the basis of Chapter VII, which regulates combat 
missions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri by an </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; from the 
"Mixer" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Fabio Fabbri, Defense Minister, 
we have heard our soldiers say that they are ready to go to 
Bosnia. You have reacted cautiously. Beniamino Andreatta, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, has said, at last. Have you spoken 
to each other? 
  [Fabbri] No, we have not spoken recently, but I see no 
substantial or fundamental differences between Fabbri and 
Andreatta. 
  [Correspondent] And so his "at last," and your caution are 
the same thing? 
  [Fabbri] We ought to review the facts. We are still not 
facing a request from the United Nations. Up until now, the 
United Nations has had a rule discouraging countries bordering 
the former Yugoslavia from participating. 
  [Correspondent] Do you know whether or not this UN rule 
which 
forbids or discourages the intervention of forces from 
neighboring countries has been violated? 
  [Fabbri] I do not think there have been departures from this 
rule, and I think that the United Nations should reflect because 
once this rule has been violated then the rule has no validity 
anymore anywhere in the world. 
  [Correspondent] Then this would be the first time? 
  [Fabbri] Yes, it would be when it happened and the result of 
a choice, a very important deliberate choice. 
  [Correspondent] If the United Nations were to request this, 
are you ready? 
  [Fabbri] In principle, we have already been ready to respond 
to all UN requests. We have done so in Somalia and Mozambique. 
Personally, I am convinced that a country's prestige depends, to 
a large extent, on its capacity to respond to these requests. 
In the matter under discussion the decision is still mainly to 
be made at the United Nations. 
  [Correspondent] If the United Nations calls, Italy responds. 
This is the point? 
  [Fabbri] Italy will study the problem. It will see... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Have you discussed it? 
  [Fabbri] For example, I would have no doubts about 
intervening on the ground once a peace agreement had been 
reached between the sides, if this were the situation. If, for 
example, one of the sides in the conflict was not in agreement, 
then this is an assessment that the United Nations has to make 
beforehand. [sentence as heard] Therefore, that is why it is too 
early to talk about this. 
  [Correspondent] But would the first to go be the San Marco 
or 
the Folgore regiments? Have you discussed this or is it still 
too early? 
  [Fabbri] No, we have not discussed this because, if you want 
my personal opinion, the United Nations, for reasons of 
convenience, taking into account constitutional matters, should 
not request this. 
  [Correspondent] Is this also because elections are to be 
held 
in Italy? 
  [Fabbri] This is a condition which the United Nations must 
take into account. There is a dissolved parliament. It would 
be difficult to undertake such a delicate mission, considering 
the historic precedents and the geographical position without a 
parliamentary vote. 
  [Correspondent] And this is one of the reasons for your 
caution? 
  [Fabbri] It is one of the reasons for my caution and above 
all a reason which the United Nations cannot fail but take into 
account. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] At present, the Armed Forces -- we saw this 
in the report before this interview -- have a great presence. 
They also have prestige abroad and at home. Is there a risk 
that the country is being militarized? 
  [Fabbri] Not at all. 
  [Correspondent] But is there a danger of a coup d'etat? We 
have heard about such things recently. 
  [Fabbri] These rumors have no foundation. The Armed Forces 
are a healthy organ of the nation -- security for the country, 
not a danger. 
  [Correspondent] Were reports on an attack on the Saxa Rubra 
radio and TV installations an invention or part of a 
destabilizing game? 
  [Fabbri] I would call this the Saxa Rubra farce because the 
investigators themselves say that the organizers ordered an 
atomic submarine and 50 F-16's by fax. Think about it: Because 
of a lack of resources we have been unable to lease 24 British 
Tornados. Therefore, this was a subversive idea which could not 
be carried out and was the fruit of the ideas of a group of 
confused or excited people. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] So you can confirm that there is no danger 
of 
a coup d'etat in Italy? 
  [Fabbri] Absolutely none. Even to hypothesize about one is a 
mistake, because there is no possible foundation, no link 
between any lunatics who think about carrying out a coup by 
taking over RAI and bombing parliament with nerve gas and the 
activities of the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces are loyal and 
faithful to the Constitution. Soldiers die for being faithful 
to the oath of loyalty which they have made to the state. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion by Jose </F>
Maria Brunet; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Brunet] Did you wish to 
begin a new stage at the Interior Ministry? 
  [Asuncion] No. It is a matter of continuing the same plan 
with my own methodology, but the plan's essence is the same. My 
conduct is based on continuity. There is no break in the 
ministry's policy. There are people who believed that they had 
served their term at the ministry and asked to be replaced, and 
we opted for complying with this request, taking into account 
the years that they have spent here. 
  [Brunet] What circumstances define the antiterrorist 
struggle at the beginning of 1994? 
  [Asuncion] We are undoubtedly faring better. A great deal 
of progress has been made in the public response to violence in 
the Basque Country. It is noteworthy progress for society to 
reject this, and for the parties, despite the wrenches that may 
be thrown in the works, to maintain their consensus on 
terrorism. The purely policing aspect must be adjusted to the 
responses that have to be made at each moment. In the political 
sphere, we must continue as until now. The fact that platforms 
for peace are proliferating and organizations whose origin lies 
in the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party] political area are 
softening their message and daring to say that violence leads 
nowhere, seems to me important. There is a substantial change. 
This is undoubtedly drawing Herri Batasuna toward a new 
strategy; hence the dialogue-oriented face that those who have 
been protecting the crime syndicate now wish to present. So it 
is a good thing that they wish to present that image, but I have 
the impression that it is purely electoral strategy; that they 
are going to see whom they deceive. 
  [Brunet] That is happening while attacks are taking place in 
Madrid and Barcelona. 
  [Asuncion] Yes, but that is the inconsistency of what is a 
purely electoral strategy on the part of Herri Batasuna, with 
that image that they wish to present, that concerns them. But 
they have not stopped. We have had attempts and one casualty in 
Barcelona since I arrived at this ministry. There have been 
attempts in Huesca, at a Civil Guard barracks, bombs attached to 
vehicles in Bilbao, 60 kg of amonal [explosive] in Madrid, and 
the attack on a colonel in Barcelona. Hence, the activity is 
continuing, and we must be alert. 
  [Brunet] You have a certain reputation as a hard-liner. 
Does it weary you or are you now accustomed to the idea? 
  [Asuncion] It seems to me that it is completely 
inappropriate that a democratically elected government, where 
citizens are free to express themselves, to carry out their 
political plans, and to conduct politically the representation 
of the people, should have to sit down with a gang of criminals. 
So it is not feasible for a democratically elected government 
to negotiate with a gang of killers who represent only 
themselves. I believe that it is not feasible, has no chance. 
  [Brunet] Against the raising of principles, it can be said 
that this was attempted in Algiers. 
  [Asuncion] Nobody can be accused of a lack of will to try 
everything, but it was found that that did not work out, and 
from that point there has been nothing, not that there can be 
anything. Algiers is unrepeatable. 
  [Brunet] Does the reputation of being a hard-liner bother 
you or not? 
  [Asuncion] Few things bother me, but I believe that it does 
not reflect reality. I am a completely normal individual. I do 
not know the reason for that hard-liner label. The fact is that 
it seems to me that there are stances on which you cannot 
compromise. I do not believe that you can compromise with these 
men of violence, and that you must make appropriate responses. 
If that is being hard-line, I will be, but I believe that that 
is a normal reaction. 
  [Brunet] The impression has been formed that there were 
other people at the Interior Ministry, such as Vera, who were 
considering the possibility of dialogue. 
  [Asuncion] Dialogue is impossible as long as they continue 
to kill. There can be no dialogue with somebody who does not 
wish to have it. I do not know exactly what Vera's personal 
opinion was, but I wish to make it clear that the government 
does not establish channels of dialogue with terrorists, and so 
I believe that Rafael Vera complied in these matters, which are 
government orders that are accepted. Vera left because he was 
tired -- he said so on the first day -- and I understand that 
fact. 
  [Brunet] In the event of ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] 
relinquishing its weapons, how far could the state go in order 
to promote rehabilitation? 
  [Asuncion] It is laid down in the legal procedures. The 
framework created by parliament is the scope that we have. 
Those who break the code are punished. The grounds on which 
you justify your crime are the least of it. Every criminal 
justifies his crime, but he commits it; breaks a rule of conduct. 
  [Brunet] There are people in the prisons who would perhaps 
like to see new prospects.... 
  [Asuncion] The people who are in the prisons are well 
acquainted with the prison law and the regulations. They know 
very well to whom they must turn to that effect. The oversight 
judges are the ones who oversee the carrying out of sentences, 
and so that is not unknown. But if you are referring to 
pardons, that is not feasible. The only thing that is possible 
as a reference point is the political parties' agreements, and 
the framework in which that takes place is the Ajuria Enea 
pacts, which were later reproduced in Madrid. The frame of 
reference is what is now accepted a priori by the political 
parties. 
  [Brunet] How is the dialogue with the People's Party viewed 
at the Interior Ministry? 
  [Asuncion] Whenever there is a preelection atmosphere, the 
People's Party uses these issues. I would ask that we keep cool 
heads and that the elections do not entail a deterioration in 
the political consensus on terrorism. That is undoubtedly what 
would would delight Herri Batasuna; for there to be discord in 
the area of the Ajuria Enea agreements. Our duty is to prevent 
that from happening, with cool heads and setting aside matters 
that could disturb that consensus. After June, everything will 
return to normal, but we must prevent this from breaking down 
now. My opinion is that the Herri Batasuna area will attempt 
this. The steps that they are taking are to try to deceive the 
first person to approach them. 
  [Brunet] Were splits nearly created by the Basque 
Socialists' initiative in favor of dialogue with Herri Batasuna? 
  [Asuncion] No, no, no. There is a great deal of common 
sense in the parties about this matter. So it affects nothing. 
The parties' response has been very favorable. I hope to have 
a meeting with them soon. That was a proposal that the Basque 
Socialist Party should discuss within itself and consider 
whether to bring it before the Ajuria Enea committee, and in any 
event to discuss it there. The fact is that this initiative's 
being leaked without people having knowledge of these matters 
represents an omission, a shadow that had to be explained 
personally to the parties. 
  [Brunet] You say that there is nothing to discuss with ETA. 
What about Herri Batasuna? 
  [Asuncion] Herri Batasuna is now bringing a bill before 
parliament. Let them speak. Let us see what they say. This is 
a bill out of context, publicity seeking, because what they want 
is to change the general organic prison law and the penal code. 
It is a very strange bill, aimed at justifying the lack of 
attention that these people in the Herri Batasuna area have for 
the ETA prisoners. 
  [Brunet] So there is nothing to be said in the interparty 
dialogue.... 
  [Asuncion] It seems to me absurd for those who do not 
frequent the forums for discussion and who renounce the 
political participation that they have had endorsed by elections 
to try to seek other things. At least, it is my impression that 
their inbreeding is such that anything other than ego, 
self-advertisement, and complacency -- specifically political 
confrontation in the institutions -- frightens them. 
  [Brunet] That is, you would advise the Basque Socialists not 
to sit down with Herri Batasuna.... 
  [Asuncion] I will confine myself to making the observations 
that I have just set out. They will know very well what they 
wish to do. Right now, Herri Batasuna would sit down with 
anybody, as long as they present an image different from what 
they really are, but as a mere electioneering strategy. That 
does seem dangerous to me; that any party should give Herri 
Batasuna credibility. That is a matter that should be closely 
watched. It seems to me that this area is very concerned about 
what is happening around it, which is why they have such strong 
reservations with respect to organizations such as Elkarri. 
  [Brunet] Recently, three Herri Batasuna members who were 
going to see Antxon in Santo Domingo were not allowed in. Does 
that have anything to do with these opinions that you are 
expressing? 
  [Asuncion] It seems to me stupid that those who are killing, 
as in the case of Barcelona, should go the next day to see the 
sanhedrin in exile in order to explain. It seems to me totally 
inconsistent. They have no reason now to play any more charades 
of that kind. 
  [Brunet] Was there an explicit request to the Dominican 
Republic? 
  [Asuncion] We would say that the meeting was not authorized. 
  [Brunet] Through diplomatic channels.... 
  [Asuncion] Of course. 
  [Brunet] When the People's Party says that there can never 
be rehabilitation for crimes of bloodshed, is it adopting a 
correct approach? 
  [Asuncion] If the People's Party wishes to carry that out as 
it says, there must be a change in the law. Under the current 
prison law -- which was unanimously approved in parliament, 
including the Popular Alliance -- those distinctions do not 
exist. This does not mean that it will not be changed. Serving 
sentences in full is a proposal advocated by the PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party], which proposes changes in the law for 
this, through the penal code. 
  [Brunet] The Basque Nationalist Party seems not to share 
that view. 
  [Asuncion] The matter was resolved within the framework of 
the Ajuria Enea pacts, also signed by the People's Party. The 
fact is that what the People's Party signs is one thing, and 
what it says is another, but the real issue will be seen in 
March. The penal code will be approved in that month, and I 
have already said what the PSOE's election pledge was. Insofar 
as agreement can be reached on the proposal, that will be the 
legal framework that will define a new dynamic. 
  [Brunet] That is, you are clearly in favor of serving 
sentences in full. 
  [Asuncion] Of course. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Pyry Lapintie: "Armed Forces To Try New Methods </F>
in Conscript Training"] 
  [Text] Sakyla -- The Armed Forces will begin developing and 
modernizing conscript training. The modernization experiment 
will be initiated in the Turku-Pori military province and will 
involve 3,000 conscripts plus a few hundred members of the 
regular cadre at three defense installations. 
  The experiment will involve the previous year's last class 
and this year's first class of the Pori Brigade, the Turku 
Coastal Regiment, and the Varsinais Suomi Antiaircraft Regiment. 
  The development project is being directed by Major General 
Hannu Sarkio, the commander of the Turku-Pori military province. 
According to Sarkio, the reason for the experiment is the ever 
more critical assessment of the training by the conscripts 
themselves. 
  The Armed Forces have also become concerned that an 
increasing number of conscripts are prematurely terminating 
their tour of duty. Last year as many as 8 percent of the age 
group terminated their tour of duty prematurely. The shortening 
of the alternative civilian service option also appears 
attractive to increasing numbers of youth, according to Sarkio. 
  In Sarkio's opinion, the training could be made more 
efficient. This might decrease the number of premature 
terminations. Sarkio feels that the training should not be 
interrupted by factors like "the drill instructors are no fun" 
and they "raise the hackles of the conscripts." 
  If the drill instructor does not have respect, then Sarkio 
feels "something must be done." "Exhausted or weary instructors, 
who just cannot get it done anymore, could get transfers to 
duties in, for example, headquarters, maintenance, and 
administration," says Sarkio.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gerard Longuet, minister of industry and </F>
foreign trade, by Marc Paoloni; place and date not given: 
"Gerard Longuet: `The Three Large Powers Have an Interest in 
Talking Together'"] 
  [Text] [Paoloni] On Monday [7 March] in Brussels you are 
said to have agreed to a rather soft condemnation by the Twelve 
of the U.S. use of the Super 301 weapon against Japan. On the 
eve of your visit to Tokyo and one month after the signing of 
the Uruguay Round agreements [as published], is that not a 
mistake? 
  [Longuet] No. The Twelve felt that this was a decision made 
by the United States during the interim period separating us 
from the entry into force of these agreements and, to some 
extent, that it was the "last" recourse to the Super 301. The 
Twelve also clearly expressed their great concern and repeated 
their vigorous opposition to any form of unilateralism used to 
settle trade disputes. Moreover, the European Commission was 
given the task of ensuring that the Community's interests are 
not threatened. 
  [Paoloni] The fact remains that another GATT member, Japan, 
is itself definitely threatened by unilateral trade sanctions. 
  [Longuet] Mickey Kantor let us know that this decision was 
made in order to prevent the use of more radical measures, 
bearing in mind how Congress feels about the conflict between 
the United States and Japan. In this showdown with the 
Japanese, the Americans are even asking us if we are prepared to 
given them a hand. 
  [Paoloni] What is the answer? 
  [Longuet] The Europeans have remained very cautious. They 
have condemned the unilateralism while at the same time 
acknowledging that there is a fundamental problem with Japan 
that will have to be dealt with some day. 
  [Paoloni] Will you take any initiatives in this area during 
your stay in Tokyo? 
  [Longuet] If I were to suggest an idea, it would be to say 
to 
the Japanese that the three large trading powers have an 
interest in talking together. Experience shows that 
tete-a-tetes rather quickly turn into conflicts and that it 
would perhaps be more judicious to move on to a "trilogue." 
This is all the more true since a bilateral agreement between 
Japan and the United States may well be useful, but if this 
agreement is reached to the detriment of other partners, we 
cannot accept it. Hence the idea of having three of us around 
the table. There is a roadblock between Washington and Tokyo 
and both of them need an ally; the Americans so that they do not 
get themselves condemned for taking excessive unilateral 
measures and the Japanese so that they can try and make the 
Americans understand that if there is a trade deficit there are 
perhaps structural reasons which cannot be solved by coercive 
measures. 
  [Paoloni] What are the objectives of your visit to Tokyo as 
far as France is concerned? 
  [Longuet] First of all, I would like to gain information 
about the economic policy of the Japanese authorities and their 
objectives; second, about their investment plans in Europe; and 
lastly, I would like to encourage them to take the path of 
modest but significant market openings, which we have obtained. 
Indeed, for six months now, Japan's market has been open to 
three French products: public works, where GTM [Marseille Heavy 
Construction Works] won an initial contract; pork; and the 
purchase of Eurocopter helicopters by Japanese governmental 
departments. 
  [Paoloni] As regards investments, there must be at least one 
about which you are primarily concerned. 
  [Longuet] Of course. As a representative of the main 
shareholder in Bull, I will meet with NEC [Nippon Electronics 
Corporation], one of the two private shareholders in the French 
company. However, I will also talk to my interlocutors about 
other issues of interest to France: the automotive sector, 
telecommunications, the agrofood sector, etc. Since I will be 
accompanying the prime minister to China, I am also interested 
in relations between Japan and China. 
  [Paoloni] With regard to China, how do you view its 
application to join GATT? 
  [Longuet] These membership negotiations will be a good 
opportunity to introduce social concerns into relations with 
that major partner -- concerns which we are not yet in a 
position to decree and impose within the framework of a world 
trade organization. Indeed, one cannot imagine Europe 
supporting this membership if there are no corresponding serious 
commitments made by China in this area. To some, that might 
seem to be overly formal, but we must bear in mind the fact that 
the whole system of international progress advances by small 
steps. The Uruguay Round took us almost 10 years to complete. 
Environmental and social concerns are our next objectives in 
the medium term.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described 
the meeting between Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and 
European Union [EU] Commission President Jacques Delors as 
particularly positive. Venizelos stated that Papoulias said he 
was satisfied with the meeting and hoped it would produce 
results. Responding to a question on whether there is a new 
initiative from Delors on the issue of Skopje, the spokesman 
said that for several days there has been a political initiative 
from the EU Commission that could take more specific forms. 
Venizelos said that anything that leads to the formulation of 
positions for the resumption of the dialogue is positive. 
  The government spokesman also said that Foreign Minister 
Papoulias, who is presiding over the EU Council of Ministers, 
will visit Belgrade and Moscow. However, the dates of his 
visits were not revealed. Referring to the purpose of the 
visits, the spokesman said that it is obvious: To be informed 
in person on the positions of the Serb leadership and the 
Russian initiatives in the Balkans.

  [Excerpt] Spain will say yes to the UN request for more 
blue helmets for Bosnia, but it will do so symbolically. This 
was announced this afternoon by Foreign Minister Javier Solana, 
who met with his Portuguese counterpart. The Spanish and 
Portuguese foreign ministers spoke about the European Union 
enlargement and both defend the same interests. They hope that 
Norway will change its stance on fishing. Over to Pedro 
Fernandez Cespedes. 
  [Fernandez Cespedes] Despite yesterday's attack on the 
Spanish Aviocar over Croatia, the government will not only keep 
up its commitment in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but is already studying 
the possibility of increasing our presence in the area, albeit 
symbolically. 
  While waiting for the Army chief of staff's report, Minister 
Solana adds another company of soldiers to the technicians the 
defense minister promised yesterday. 
  [Begin Solana recording] He was speaking about the 
possibility of sending some radar-type material along with 
technicians, that would be some 30 people or something like 
that. And the Ministry of Defense is considering the 
possibility of maybe sending a company of soldiers. That would 
be it. 
  I have to repeat that Spain is fulfilling its obligations. 
It is doing so generously, efficiently. [end recording] 
  [Fernandez Cespedes] Minister Solana is sure that 
yesterday's 
attack on the Spanish Aviocar will get an adequate answer from 
the international community. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vienna, March l0 (AFP) -- Differences of 
interpretation over an agreement on inspection of nuclear sites 
have arisen between North Korea and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], sources said here Thursday [10 March]. 
  They were commenting on a disclosure by a U.S. State 
Department official in Washington that "difficulties" were being 
experienced by Agency inspectors who went to North Korea a week 
ago to vet seven declared facilities. 
  They are trying to determine whether North Korea has 
diverted 
plutonium from its Yongbyon reactor since the IAEA's last full 
inspection in February last year. 
  Agency spokesman David Kyd refused however to go into detail 
about the reported difficulties. The inspection was continuing, 
with some tasks accomplished and others still to be carried out, 
he said. The team hoped to wind up the mission as scheduled by 
next Tuesday, and there was no plan to recall the inspectors any 
earlier. 
  "It is half-time now and there is no use in speculating how 
the game will end," Kyd remarked.

  [Text] Paris, March 10 KYODO -- Yoshiyasu Sato, the newly 
elected chairman of the International Energy Agency's [IEA] 
governing board, says the 23-nation agency is searching for a 
new role following the end of the Cold War. 
  Sato said the IEA, a forum for oil consuming countries, will 
continue to engage in dialogue with the oil producing countries. 
  "But there is also concern over environmental problems 
caused 
by high energy consumption accompanying high growth rates in 
China and other Asian countries," Sato said in an interview. 
  "And there are a lot of other issues like the fall-off in 
production in Russia which used to be the world's largest oil 
producer." 
  The 59-year-old Sato, who is also Japan's ambassador to the 
Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), said guaranteed stability of energy is 
decisively important to the economy. 
  "Especially for Japan, which doesn't have oil resources 
domestically, energy security is a pillar of its economy and 
diplomacy," Sato said. 
  The IEA this year celebrates its 20th anniversary since its 
founding during the oil shock of the 1970's. 
  It attracted international attention when it was set up in 
1974 as a body representing the interests of consumer countries 
as opposed to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC). But recently it has assumed a lower profile as crude oil 
prices have stabilized. 
  Sato has a wide network of personal contacts in high places. 
  At the time of his election as the IEA governing board 
chairman, the U.S. representative nominated him and the German 
representative seconded the nomination. 
  "Both were old acquaintances," Sato said. "It was good to 
have those relationships." 
  The IEA will hold its first meeting since Sato assumed the 
post in Kyoto in April at which it will hold seminars on 
policies to carry it through to the end of the century. 
  Sato is a former head of the Foreign Ministry's Economic 
Affairs Bureau. He served for three years from 1989 as chief 
secretary to the foreign minister. 
  Since July 1992, he has served as Japan's ambassador to the 
OECD.

  [Text] Brussels, March 9 (AFP) -- The International 
Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said Wednesday [9 March] it was 
sending a fact-finding mission to Budapest to inquire into the 
controversial dismissal of 129 journalists from state-owned 
Hungarian radio. 
  "We have grave concerns regarding media developments in 
Hungary and the deadlock over control of the broadcast system," 
IFJ secretary general Aidan White said. 
  White said his organisation was "particularly dismayed" by 
reports that some of the journalists had been singled out for 
political reasons. 
  The radio journalists dismissed last Friday are to stage a 
sit-in at their old offices Thursday, protesting what the 
opposition says is a bid by Hungary's ruling centre-right 
coalition to silence criticism two months ahead of general 
elections. 
  Hungarian opposition parties and journalists have denounced 
the dismissals as "politically motivated cleansing," and 
supporters of the journalists staged a demonstration outside the 
radio station on Tuesday. 
  In Vienna the International Press Institute addressed an 
open 
letter of protest, published Tuesday, to Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross, calling the sackings "an unprecedented 
purge" carried out for political ends. 
  The IFJ delegation, headed by Gustl Glattfelder, will arrive 
in Hungary on March 16 and meet press representatives as well as 
government officials. 
  The IFJ, based here, claims to represent 320,000 journalists 
in 75 countries.

  [Text] India has offered an unconditional dialogue with the 
United Nations or any member of the UN Human Rights Commission 
on the human rights situation in Kashmir. Talking to 
newspersons in Geneva yesterday, the minister of state for 
external affairs, Mr. Salman Khursheed, however, ruled out 
negotiation of the status of Kashmir, which is an integral part 
of the country. Mr. Khursheed said that Pakistan has no locus 
standi to teach India on human rights. He welcomed the U.S. 
decision to avoid any reference to Kashmir. 
  Earlier, in her address to the Human Rights Commission, the 
leader of the U.S. delegation, Ms. Geraldine Ferraro, made no 
reference to Jammu and Kashmir or the alleged violation of human 
rights in her six-page statement. Hailing the virtues of 
democracy, she said that democracy puts no chain around a 
nation's neck. Ms. Ferraro said true democracies allow their 
people the chance to breathe, dream, and to grow. Reports say 
that the U.S. delegation leader made it clear that Washington 
will abstain from voting on the Pakistani resolution. 
  The European Union of 12 members has also decided to abstain 
from voting on the resolution. As reported earlier, China has 
described the Pak-sponsored resolution on Kashmir as out of 
context. Iran has regretted terrorist activities being promoted 
by Islamabad in Kashmir.

  [Text] Pakistan has dropped the demand for sending a UN 
fact-finding mission to Jammu and Kashmir at the Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva. In a tactical move, the Pakistani 
delegation circulated a revised resolution on the issue 
inserting a new paragraph which calls upon the Indian Government 
to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in Jammu 
and Kashmir. However, speaking on behalf of the Indian 
delegation, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, told PTI that India would not 
accept any resolution on any aspect of Kashmir which is an 
integral part of the country. 
  The European Union also said that the substance of the 
resolution is still political in nature and will not change its 
earlier stand of abstaining in case of voting. 
  Meanwhile, India has stepped up its diplomatic offensive at 
the Human Rights Commission's session to expose unbridled 
terrorism spurned by Islamabad in Jammu and Kashmir. The 
minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, 
charged Pakistan with trying to involve the UN Human Rights 
Commission in its blatant pursuit of political and territorial 
ambitions. Mr. Khurshid said that Jammu and Kashmir is the 
symbol of India's secular democracy and declared that India will 
oppose Islamabad's politically motivated exercise. He said New 
Delhi is making efforts to manifest still greater transparency 
regarding the actual situation in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  The leader of the Indian delegation at the ongoing session 
of 
the commission, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, has expressed 
confidence that the resolution moved by Pakistan would be 
defeated when it comes up for voting.

Javier Solana, who today met his Portuguese counterpart Jose 
Durao Barroso, who has emphasized his support for Spain in this 
area. 
  Solana also referred to yesterday's attack on a Spanish 
airplane while flying on a United Nations mission. The attack 
took place over Krajina, an area controlled by the Serbs. 
Solana described the attack as very serious, and said that it 
is up to the international community to respond because this is 
the first time that a UN plane has been attacked.

<F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: "New Negotiations Next Tuesday"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- While Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. 
Olsen was defending himself against accusations of broken 
promises, the EU [European Union] last night abandoned its 
attempts to reach agreement on fish and other internal problems. 
  The stage has been set for a serious crisis both within the 
EU and in the Norwegian membership negotiations. After a 
dramatic meeting at which angry words had been exchanged, the 
EU's foreign ministers decided around midnight to abandon the 
attempt to find a solution to their internal problems and to 
reach a fisheries agreement with Norway. The EU ministers will 
not meet again until Tuesday [15 March] next week. The chairman 
of the Council of Ministers, Theodhoros Pangalos, said at a 
press conference last night that Spain alone carries all the 
blame for the delay. 
  "Norway has shown flexibility by trying as best it can to 
achieve a solution," the Greek European affairs minister said. 
  However, the meeting of the EU foreign ministers did not 
break up before they had formally concluded the agricultural 
negotiations with Norway so that only fish -- and possibly the 
minke whale -- remain for the next round of negotiations. This 
morning EU Commissioner Hans van den Broek and Greek European 
Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos were to give the European 
Parliament a briefing on the situation and on the results 
achieved in the negotiations with Sweden, Finland, and Austria. 
  "I do not think that the Parliament will accept this sort of 
half-finished agreement," a Commission spokesman said last night. 
  "But if the Parliament does so, there is a great danger that 
the Norwegian car will be uncoupled from the negotiating train," 
he added. However, the picture last night was unclear. German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, however, thought that Norway 
would be able to keep up if agreement is reached on a formula in 
the course of this week. 
  Before this dramatic development Fisheries Minister Olsen 
had 
been involved in an argument with the Association of Norwegian 
Fishermen, among others, about what in quota terms he had 
actually offered Spain and the others in the EU. Olsen denied 
categorically that he had given away a single fish, but earlier 
in the evening he made this reply to a question from NRK 
[Norwegian broadcasting company] about whether he had broken his 
promise: "That remains to be seen." 
  "Norway will use the EEA [European Economic Area] fish 
[quotas granted to Spain and Portugal in the framework of the 
EEA agreement] for all it is worth," Olsen said at a press 
conference. He also said that with his proposal to the EU he had 
wanted to counter quota demands from the other side. 
  But have you given any fish away? 
  "No, I have not given away a single fish," the hard-pressed 
fisheries minister said. 
  "The fisheries minister has given away fish," Vigdis 
Harsvik, 
secretary general of the Association of Norwegian Fishermen, 
said yesterday when she saw Norway's proposed fisheries 
agreement with the EU. Others were less sure about the 
interpretation of the complicated Norwegian calculations. The 
drama further increased when it became known that Spain had 
rejected the proposal because it did not give the country enough 
fish. 
  The Spanish rejection led to sharp reactions from the EU's 
Greek presidency and Germany. "Never before have I been so 
angry," German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in a clear 
reference to Spain. Kinkel pointed out that Spain would never 
have become an EU member if Germany had not lent a helping hand, 
and warned of the consequences if the EU fails in this major 
project of enlargement. 
  "I am disappointed," Kinkel said before leaving Brussels in 
the early hours. He said that the problem was the EU's and not 
Norway's. "We were 98 percent in agreement with Norway on 
fish," he said. 
  In the Norwegian paper, which was being freely circulated, 
Norway stated first that the quota of 11,000 [units not 
specified] which the EU will be allowed to fish in 1997 is to be 
brought forward to 1995. This means that in total there will be 
an additional 3,750 tonnes of fish for the EU in 1995 and 1996. 
In addition there will be technical adjustments which, 
according to Norway's calculations, will mean that the EU will 
receive an additional annual quota of 2,000 tonnes after 1997. 
  The comprehensive fisheries package that was rejected by 
Spain yesterday evening consists of a series of elements that 
all aim at satisfying the demands from Spain and Portugal for 
increased quotas and ending the current discrimination against 
the countries within the framework of the EU's common fisheries 
policy. A Norwegian source stressed that the EU now has an 
understanding of Norway's argument that it is not fair to make 
Norway alone bear the burden of putting right the error made 
when Spain and Portugal joined the EU. 
  Norway is also offering to allow an unexploited cod quota 
outside Canada's 200-mile zone to pass to the EU. Spain has 
interests in this area, but Canada and the EU disagree on how 
the fishing in the area is to be regulated. In addition, Greece 
is offering to give away 500 tonnes of its quota, and there was 
speculation yesterday evening that Germany too would consider 
giving away some of its quota in Norwegian waters. 
  As far as the issue of market access is concerned, there is 
now talk of a transitional period of three years for the planned 
oversight mechanism. On the subject of the administration of 
resources north of the 62d parallel and negotiations with 
Russia, there will be a statement which in the Norwegian view 
meets the Norwegian need for a defensible administration regime. 
The EU accepts the Norwegian demand that Spitsbergen should be 
kept out of the EU so that the current system of administration 
can remain the same.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Nikolaos Bellos] </F>
  [Text] The messages that we have so far are hopeful. We 
are continuously coordinating with UN mediator Cyrus Vance and 
European Union [EU] Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek. We have 
good faith, a desire to achieve a solution, and optimism. This 
is how Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias addressed the European 
Parliament [EP] plenary session in Strasbourg, presenting the 
latest developments in Skopje [The former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM]. Papoulias was speaking just a few hours 
before his important meeting with Vance tomorrow. 
  The foreign minister briefed the deputies on the issue of 
Skopje and clearly presented the Greek positions and the reasons 
that led the government to adopt measures against Skopje. 
Referring to Skopje's continuing aggression, Papoulias 
described the measures as an extreme means of self-defense 
toward this Republic's intransigence and expansionist designs. 
  Van Den Broek, who has taken over the effort to approach 
Athens and Skopje, stressed he is in continuous contact with the 
two sides. He added that in coordination with the United 
Nations, efforts are being made for a peaceful settlement of the 
problem. Referring to the measures that the government adopted 
unilaterally against Skopje, Van Den Broek stressed that they 
equal trade sanctions and concern the EU. The commissioner said 
he hopes the measures will be lifted soon and that both sides 
will make efforts to resolve the problem. Concluding, Van Den 
Broek said that Skopje depends on Greece financially but that 
stability in Skopje is in Greece's best interest. 
  In their majority, the representatives of the political 
groups said they oppose the Greek measures and asked the Greek 
Government to lift them. They also asked Skopje to remove the 
symbols from the flag and change its Constitution. 
  Replying to questions from the deputies, Papoulias stressed 
that Greece does not want tension in the area, and that it has 
always been and continues to be a factor of stability in the 
Balkans. He said: Our side is ready to overcome the current 
tension with preliminary discussions, but [FYROM President Kiro] 
Gligorov must also show goodwill.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias yesterday urged 
his European partners not to accept a lesser role than the 
United States or Russia in Bosnian peace efforts. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Mr Papoulias said 
the European Union [EU] had wanted a presence by Moscow and 
Washington and said their efforts to resolve the Bosnian 
conflict had been positive. 
  "But we cannot just sit back and give up on our action plan. 
The EU cannot accept being put on a lower rung than the United 
States and Russia," he said. 
  Mr Papoulias said EU foreign ministers, who discussed former 
Yugoslavia over dinner, all agreed on the need to reinforce the 
United Nations Protection Force - but he gave no indication who 
might send more soldiers. 
  Mr Papoulias said "there was no objection" at the dinner to 
a 
suggestion by French Minister Alain Juppe that there should be a 
meeting between the United States, Russia and the EU to prepare 
discussions with all sides in the Bosnian conflict. 
  Heading an EU delegation, Mr Papoulias will fly to Belgrade 
and then on to Moscow this coming Friday [11 March] for talks in 
support of EU peace efforts in Bosnia. 
  He is scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev on Saturday to discuss Bosnia. 
  The focus of peace efforts has shifted to Russia, in an 
attempt to use Moscow's influence with the Serbs to back 
settlement initiatives. 
  The Croatian Foreign Minister, Mate Granic, and Bosnia's 
Haris Silajdzic are both due in Moscow this week. 
  Among the proposals they will be discussing is a United 
States-backed plan to roughly divide the former Yugoslavia 
between Serb-held areas and a Muslim-Croat coalition. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected to 
discuss the plan when he visits the Russian Town of Vladivostok 
on March 14.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Industry Growing Again; More Foreign </F>
Orders"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- In January, business optimism about the 
economy improved again. Among the indicators used by the Wifo 
[Economic Research Institute] expectations regarding production 
were clearly more optimistic than three months ago: More 
companies expect an expansion instead of a decline in production 
over the coming months. Orders and capacity utilization are also 
assessed more favorably, a Wifo report on the economic 
development says. 
  At the end of 1993, rising export orders stimulated 
industry. 
During the fourth quarter, industry produced 1 percent more 
than a year before. The recovery began in advanced sectors. 
<H5>  Recovery in the Construction Sector </H5>
  In the fourth quarter -- for the first time since autumn 
1992 
-- exports also surpassed the level of the previous year (plus 
1.5 percent). Exports to Western Europe were down, but this was 
offset by higher demand from the United States, Southeast Asia, 
China, and Eastern Europe. 
  Domestic demand also developed in a relatively favorable 
manner at the end of 1993. Retail trade turnover remained 
stable in seasonally adjusted terms around the end of the year. 
The situation was particularly good in public works and 
foundation work; building construction also experienced an 
increase. 
  As a result of the beginnings of an economic recovery, the 
labor market stabilized. In February, while unemployment was 
only slightly higher, employment was slightly lower than last 
year. If this trend continues, the unemployment rate might stay 
below the predicted value for this year. 
<H5>  Declining Inflation Rate </H5>
  At the beginning of this year, inflation abated, falling 
from 
3.5 percent to 3.1 percent in January. The increase in prices 
of industrial and retail goods, foodstuffs, and private 
services, in particular in tourism, decreased. The rise in 
petroleum tax and charges for some public sevices at the 
beginning of the year, on the other hand, accelerated inflation. 
  In contrast to previous years, rates for some public service 
increased more strongly than the prices of private services. To 
what extent the participation in the European Economic Area has 
contributed to dampening inflation has not yet been 
investigated, according to Wifo.

<F P=106> [Report by Erich Hoornt: "Massive Increase in Exports to </F>
Far East"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Austrian export companies, which 
traditionally concentrate on Europe, have now been successful in 
the dynamic Far Eastern markets for several years. Last year 
alone exports to this region increased by 11.9 percent, while 
overall exports went down. 
  Even though Japan remained the most important market in the 
Far East despite its recession and the resulting decline in 
Austrian exports, deliveries to most other Far Eastern countries 
also increased. Thus, last year exports to South Korea went up 
by 50 percent, those to China and Thailand by about 40 percent, 
to Indonesia by 24 percent, to Hong Kong by 11 percent, and to 
Taiwan and Singapore by almost 7 percent. Heavy losses had to 
be accepted in India, however, 
<H5>  Prospects for the Future </H5>
  Despite the increase in exports, the share of the Far East 
in 
Austria's total exports is rather modest with 5.3 percent. In 
1989 it was, however, just 4 percent. Egon Winkler, head of the 
Foreign Trade Department of the Economic Chamber, told DIE 
PRESSE that this region is still underrepresented compared with 
comparable states, such as Denmark, Sweden, or the Netherlands. 
  However, there is the hope that the exports to the Far East 
will continue to rise this year and in the coming years despite 
the potential membership in the European Union [EU], because, 
after all, this is economically the most dynamic area of the 
world, which has also contributed to the success of domestic 
exports. However, it was also the losses in Austrian exports to 
the EU that made the Austrian companies get more interested in 
the Asian market. 
  Winkler stresses that the programs of his organization have 
proved their worth in the Far East. The number of Austrian 
companies in the Far East is rising constantly: At the moment 
there are about 800 such companies. 
  In 1993 imports from the Far East declined by 2.1 percent, 
the share in overall imports is 9.15 percent. The Austrian 
trade balance deficit, however, is gigantic: Exports are only 
half as high as imports.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Andreas Schwarz: "Whitewater and Watergate"] </F>
  [Text] The acoustic similarity of the terms is tempting: 
Watergate and Whitewater, both stand for scandal and for 
cover-up. The Republicans may be particularly tempted by that, 
because Richard Nixon fell over the cover-up of the break-in 
into the Democrats' headquarters two decades ago. The fact that 
now a Democratic President is displaying extreme clumsiness as 
he tries to get through the investigations against him is just 
what his opponents want. 
  The comparison is lacking in one respect: The Watergate 
break-in took place, and Nixon was not proved to have 
participated in it but to have lied. Whether the Clintons' 
Whitewater deal is to be challenged in the first place is still 
open, and the Clintons have not yet been proved to be lying. 
Compared with Watergate, the Whitewater affair will probably 
remain only a little brook. 
  Nevertheless: Richard Nixon did not fall because the 
Republicans wanted to hurt their enemy but because the president 
led the investigators by the nose and hurt the people -- in 
their trust. The Clintons have come that far already: Holding 
back incriminating files about the affair and ordering the 
investigators to report constantly on their findings, this gives 
the affair -- if there is not more hidden behind it -- a bad 
taste. 
  There is one thing that Whitewater has shown as a basic 
tenet: The team around the President is as weak as its boss. 
Very close associates and advisers are chosen either by Bill 
Clinton as a result of friendship or by the First Lady. The 
fact that Clinton's only emerging (and still disputed) success 
-- the health reform -- has been accomplished by her is as 
characteristic as the fact that it is her role in the Whitewater 
case that is the incriminating one and not his. In addition, 
there are no real strategists in the White House, who could 
provide a bit of direction to the President's presentation. 
Clinton prefers to do all that himself by eagerly praising his 
wife (since she also defended him when he was accused of 
womanizing). 
  This shows that there is indeed a difference between 
Watergate and Whitewater: Even in a mess Nixon still had style.

<F P=106> [Interview with Fons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian </F>
Central Bank, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given: "Fons Verplaetse, Man of Influence: The Recession Is 
Over, But Our Efforts Must Be Sustained"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] The business barometer of the 
Central Bank shows improvement. Is recovery now underway? 
  [Verplaetse] The recession is over, there is no doubt about 
that. The United Kingdom suffered eight consecutive quarters of 
negative growth. We had four. The recession was delayed by the 
effects of German reunification. The low point came in the 
first quarter of 1993. The second and third quarters were 
better. A slight falling off is possible in the fourth quarter 
due to the situation in the construction industry and social 
conflict. 
  Our barometer, which is reliable whatever people may say, 
shows that we should record 0.8 percent growth in 1994 without 
any new factors. I believe it will be higher, but we are 
remaining cautious. 
  [Correspondent] Not everyone is stating so clearly that the 
recession is over. 
  [Verplaetse] But that is the situation. To say anything else 
would be incorrect. 
  [Correspondent] Will we return to the same economic 
conditions as before the recession? 
  [Verplaetse] The growth potential in Belgium is in the 
region 
of 2 or 2.5 percent. Beyond that and you start to create 
tensions. Personally, I do not believe that we will exceed our 
potential growth in 1994. After that, we will see. 
  [Correspondent] But always with persistent unemployment? 
  [Verplaetse] To maintain employment in the private sector we 
need a 2 percent growth rate. As the working population is 
growing by 0.5 percent, this means we in fact need 2.5 percent 
growth in order to keep unemployment at present levels. So at 
the very best we will have stable unemployment figures. 
  Solutions? We must act on three fronts, and sustain our 
efforts: We must reduce the cost of labor compared with the cost 
of capital; we must divide available employment among a greater 
number of individuals with a corresponding fall in incomes; we 
must increase the flexibility of the labor market. The global 
plan aims to act on these fronts. I do not foresee a general 
reduction in jobs. 
  [Correspondent] What is your reaction to company closures? 
  [Verplaetse] It hurts, but it is unavoidable. The relative 
importance of industry is decreasing in favor of services. And 
that process will continue. Some regions will be increasingly 
affected. 
  [Correspondent] So what is to be done? 
  [Verplaetse] Make the most of the global plan and look at 
our 
fundamental problems, at our structural weaknesses. The 
government's achievements to date are pretty impressive. There 
is no use in burying your head in the sand. We must allow the 
psychological scars to heal. We must not be impatient. The 
dialogue will recommence. The Belgians are pragmatists. After 
all, what is one year in someone's life? 
<H5>  Pleased With the Rate of the Franc </H5>
  [Correspondent] Is the present strength of the Belgian franc 
justified? Does it reflect a healthy Belgian economy? 
  [Verplaetse] I believe that the Belgian economy is sound. We 
no doubt have certain structural weaknesses. The private sector 
remains much more efficient than the public sector. The current 
account shows an excellent result with a positive balance of 
over 300 billion Belgian francs. 
  [Correspondent] So you are pleased with the present rate of 
the franc? 
  [Verplaetse] Yes. 
  [Correspondent] Is your aim to arrive at the same central 
bank rate as the Germans? 
  [Verplaetse] We need the lowest possible interest rates in 
order not to aggravate the problem of public finances. On the 
other hand, the central bank rate has no effect on households. 
For companies, that depends. 
  So the question is how we can help companies. The answer is 
simple. It is by giving them the lowest possible costs. But 40 
percent of costs come from imports. Then there are other 
factors such as index-linking. The result is that, directly or 
indirectly, 80 percent of our price system is influenced by the 
rate of the Belgian franc against other currencies. 
  [Correspondent] The Belgian franc remains linked to the 
German mark. But at the same time the Belgian Central Bank is 
free to act without a green light from the Bundesbank. Is it 
therefore free of any German influence? 
  [Verplaetse] Certainly not. This very morning I telephoned 
Frankfurt and Amsterdam before making a decision. The aim is 
not to receive orders but to agree on the extent of and reasons 
for a decision. Also, in the past the Bundesbank was not 
interested in what happened in Belgium. 
  [Correspondent] Has it changed its attitude? 
  [Verplaetse] I believe that the present president of the 
Bundesbank, Hans Tietmayer, is more open to other countries than 
his predecessor, Mr. Schlesinger. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that foreigners are often 
unaware of the situation of Belgium? 
  [Verplaetse] I am quite sure they are. And that is our own 
fault, I would like to embark upon a very objective information 
campaign together with our commercial banks. 
  [Correspondent] How do you explain the fact that short-term 
interest rates are falling while long-term rates are rising? 
  [Verplaetse] There is an evident economic recovery in the 
United States. Europe is coming out of recession. Private 
investments are starting up again. There are also countries 
which cannot manage to control public expenditure. In a world 
where there is savings competition, how can you expect real 
long-term interest rates to fall? I can see no mechanism that 
could avoid this. 
<H5>  The Social Pact? "I Remain Optimistic" </H5>
  [Correspondent] Last autumn, you headed a group charged with 
drawing up the social pact. How do you view this experience 
today? 
  [Verplaetse] It was a good document and I am very proud of 
it. But I was very naive to believe that everyone was in favor 
of the social pact. 
  When the prime minister asked me to participate, my first 
reaction was to refuse. Mr. Dehaene then confronted me with a 
choice: Either you do as many of your colleagues would probably 
do, pursue an orthodox monetary policy and consider that if it 
doesn't work then it is all someone else's fault, or you tell us 
what you believe to be the necessary conditions for total 
success. I agreed provided I could do it with other people. 
  [Correspondent] Who you chose yourself? 
  [Verplaetse] I did not really have the right of veto, but I 
did say yes or no. I knew them all except for one, all of them 
perfectly reasonable people. It remains one of my best ever 
memories of cooperation within a group. 
  [Correspondent] Were you not disappointed to see how things 
turned out in the end? 
  [Verplaetse] I believed that all politicians, including the 
opposition, would respond favorably to King Albert's appeal, 
without criticizing those who had agreed to bear 
responsibilities. I had not foreseen that, if I had I would 
have perhaps refused the mission. 
  [Correspondent] The main complaint of the trade unions was 
the absence of any job guarantees in your report. 
  [Verplaetse] You must allow for time between creating 
incentives and achieving results. You must also understand that 
an effort in one sector does not necessarily produce a result in 
terms of jobs in that same sector. It is illusory to believe 
that it does, and all members of the group were agreed on that 
point. But I understand, while not agreeing with them, the 
fears of the unions. 
  [Correspondent] How did you react to the refusal of the 
trade 
unions to sign the Central Bank's report? 
  [Verplaetse] With sadness. With respect to the social 
dialogue, and it is that which is behind it all, I realized that 
the leaders could not manage to convince their members. And I 
understand that union leaders who do not have the support of 
their members are unable to sign. 
  But I remain quite optimistic. I hope that later, when the 
scars have healed, we will be able to look at the country's 
fundamental problems without apportioning blame. Belgian 
pragmatism will then make it possible to accept the inevitable 
solutions. 
  [Correspondent] Are you thinking in terms of a new major 
round of negotiations, all together round the table? 
  [Verplaetse] Perhaps not quite like that, but I remain 
confident. The will is there. I have many scenarios in mind. 
I will take initiatives, but behind the scenes.... 
<H5>  I Should Have Kept Quiet </H5>
  [Correspondent] You are accused of making a few unfortunate 
remarks during the summer. Do you accept this criticism? 
  [Verplaetse] No. I believe there was a misunderstanding. 
Perhaps I should not have tried to reply to my colleagues at the 
KUL [Louvain University]. In seeking to establish that 
Belgium's situation was not comparable to that in 1981, I did 
not state clearly enough that it was possible to improve the 
situation without devaluation. 
  Indirectly, I confronted the social partners and the 
politicians with their responsibilities. They had to take steps 
to prevent a return to the situation in 1982. It was a risk I 
took. On the other hand, I do believe it helped. All members 
of the Central Bank committee were agreed. The Bank did its 
duty. The government also had to make an effort. 
  [Correspondent] But it is you who made the statements. 
  [Verplaetse] I wanted to say that the economists at the KUL 
were wrong. But I would have been much better advised to have 
kept quiet at that point. 
<H5>  "Eighty Percent Was Adopted" </H5>
  [Correspondent] Your report inspired the global plan. Were 
your recommendations adopted? 
  [Verplaetse] Eighty percent was adopted. 
  [Correspondent] Your opinion of privatization? 
  [Verplaetse] I believe that CGER [General Savings and 
Retirement Bank]-Fortis is one of the very best examples of an 
operation which offers every guarantee of success. 
  [Correspondent] Why do the trade unions always take such a 
dim view of privatization? 
  [Verplaetse] Many of these people automatically assume that 
private initiative neglects overall well-being. And that is not 
necessarily true. An inefficient public corporation is more 
socially damaging than anything. 
  [Correspondent] And the matter of anchorage? 
  [Verplaetse] I have never thought in terms of North or 
South. 
I am Belgian. A merger between the BBL [Bank Brussles Lambert] 
and the ING [International Netherlands Group] would have led to 
the ING controlling the BBL. But in the CGER-Fortis operation, 
it is privatization which has brought the "Belgification" of the 
Fortis group. 
  [Correspondent] And the control of Belgian companies by 
foreign groups? 
  [Verplaetse] I would of course prefer the opposite, but I 
believe it is inevitable. 
  [Correspondent] Why such harsh words from Mr. Van Den 
Brande? 
  [Verplaetse] As you know, politicians sometimes have to use 
very strong language. 
<H5>  The ECU Decided in a Weekend </H5>
  [Correspondent] How do you believe we are going to move from 
the present European Monetary System (EMS) to a single currency? 
Are we going to return to more restricted limits within the EMS? 
  [Verplaetse] That is a question I cannot answer. However, I 
have never believed that the Twelve would be able to convert to 
the single currency all at the same time. There are some 
differences between Germany and Greece ... 
  If the European enterprise succeeds, and I hope and believe 
it will, there will be a first stage when some of the Twelve 
will move forward to the third stage of Economic and Monetary 
Union. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think monetary union can be achieved 
within the deadlines set? 
  [Verplaetse] What are these deadlines? 
  [Correspondent] At the latest, 1999. 
  [Verplaetse] If you read the texts carefully, you will see 
that they do not say that. 
  [Correspondent] So that means that there will be at least a 
two-speed Europe? 
  [Verplaetse] There will be a first stage which will involve 
seven or eight partners. And I believe Belgium should be one of 
them. After that, countries will join the group individually. 
  [Correspondent] How do you envisage the switch to a single 
currency for the first group? 
  [Verplaetse] For me, the ideal situation would be to 
organize 
a weekend session between the heads of state and governments at 
which it would be decided, after having consulted the governors 
and finance ministers, to launch the third stage on Monday 
morning. For me, that would be the surest scenario. 
  [Correspondent] And when would this weekend meeting of 
government leaders be held? 
  [Verplaetse] I do not know. Everything will depend on 
economic developments. It is easier to converge when things are 
going well. We need more solid growth. 
  [Correspondent] Do you believe that Belgium can reduce the 
public debt to no more than 3 percent of GDP by 1996? 
  [Verplaetse] The Central Bank's forecasts indicate that this 
is possible. I believe that Belgium will achieve its aims. But 
two points are less certain: Social security and the Regions 
and Communities. But it should be possible to solve these 
problems if we take the necessary measures.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Netherlands Positive About Role </F>
in New UN Force"] 
  [Text] The Netherlands is prepared in principle to 
contribute to an international peacekeeping force in order to 
guarantee the safety of Palestinians living in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
  "If the Netherlands receives an official request from the 
United Nations, it will certainly be given favorable 
consideration," report diplomats in The Hague. The PLO has 
urgently requested the Netherlands to adopt such a position this 
week. 
  Yusuf Habbab, the official PLO representative in the 
Netherlands, made this request in a letter addressed to 
Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans. He expects the 
Netherlands to play its part in the resumption of the Middle 
East peace process. 
  "Protection of the Palestinians is essential to the 
resumption of the peace talks," states Habbab. "The Netherlands 
can play a part in this." Great Britain and Norway also have 
been approached and, according to the PLO, have responded 
positively. 
  PLO leader 'Arafat already has made two previous urgent 
requests to the Netherlands to act as a mediator in the Middle 
East peace process as the Netherlands enjoys good relations with 
Israel. 
  In a recent telephone conversation with Israeli Prime 
Minister Rabin, the Netherlands Prime Minister Lubbers pressed 
for a rapid implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement 
in principle for limited Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip 
and around Jericho. The Netherlands is willing to use its "open 
lines" with Israel and the PLO and has offered the PLO its "good 
services." 
  The possibility of a peacekeeping force has been discussed 
within the Security Council but no decision has been made yet. 
In a statement on Monday [7 March] evening the European Union 
urged the resumption of peace talks and asked the Security 
Council for an "international presence." 
  Netherlands diplomats point out that in countries where it 
has an office, the PLO has clearly launched a diplomatic 
offensive for the formation of an international force in the 
occupied territories. 
  The question is whether the force will consists of military 
personnel or civilians. Until the Security Council makes it 
clear how the term "international presence" should be 
understood, the Netherlands refuses to undertake any specific 
actions. 
  Diplomats also report there is doubt whether Israel will 
agree to a peacekeeping force on its territory. If Israel does 
not cooperate, the United States will not agree to a Security 
Council resolution which stipulates that a peacekeeping force 
should be sent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pronk Wants More Aid To Bypass </F>
Surinamese Cabinet"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- Minister of Development Cooperation 
Pronk wants the development treaty between the Netherlands and 
Suriname to be changed. The continuing bad policies of the 
Surinamese Government are the cause of the country's deplorable 
state, the minister said on Sunday [6 March] on the "Meer op 
Zondag" NOS [Netherlands Broadcasting Foundation] television 
program. 
  The time has come to review the entire development 
relationship with Suriname, Pronk said. Aid should be directed 
to a far greater degree toward combating poverty via private 
organizations, he said. 
  Direct support to the Surinamese Government has proved 
ineffective, Pronk said in a frank examination of Surinamese 
politics. He said he was aware that there were still 
innumerable politicians and civil servants with good will in the 
country, "but they simply cannot get through." 
  The development relationship which Pronk wants would bypass 
the Surinamese Government for a large part of the aid, the 
minister said. However, the current development treaty between 
the Netherlands and Suriname does not allow that. The minister 
wants to spend part of the money to which Suriname is entitled 
under the development treaty via nongovernmental organizations 
(NGO's, like the Novib [Netherlands Organization for 
International Development Cooperation] and its foreign partners). 
  "Private organizations do not carry out the most work," 
Pronk 
said. "But they do the best work when it comes to combating 
poverty, providing health care, organizing activities for women, 
etc." 
  "When we drew up the development treaty we said: You have 
many good groups who could do this work," Pronk said. "But it 
was pulled into the political field. The organization's 
political and ethnic background was examined, and that means 
sometimes waiting for years. That is not necessary, because in 
Suriname there is a structure which is separate from politics." 
  Very recently the minister was far more positive about the 
resumption of aid to the Surinamese Government. Last November 
Pronk visited Paramaribo to discuss the matter with the 
Venetiaan government. The talks took place "in such an open and 
constructive atmosphere that I am optimistic about the 
possibility of finding a solution in the foreseeable future," he 
told Parliament three months ago. 
  Pronk made it clear on Sunday that he no longer feels such 
optimism. "Suriname had a fantastic opportunity, but has made 
little of it," he said. "There has been a democratic regime for 
a substantial number of years now, there is a lot of support, 
but there are bad policies." 
  Suriname could receive more emergency aid if the government 
carried out reform policies, Pronk repeated. "People know that, 
but nothing ever comes of it," he said. "Every time there is a 
new reason to not begin proper policies." 
  The minister now regards the poverty problem in Suriname 
partly as a problem of distribution in Suriname itself. 
"Enormous wealth has grown up in parts of the population due to 
corruption and drug dealing," he said. "People do not want to 
abandon such self-interest."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton's Clout"] </F>
  [Text] In the White House the reigning mood is half-way 
between confusion and panic, now that the so-called Whitewater 
affair has started to speed up. That is not incomprehensible: 
On Capitol Hill the Republican opposition is shouting as loud 
as possible that this scandal is "a new Watergate" that could 
cost President Clinton his head. 
  This conclusion is premature and completely wrong, but 
politically the Republicans are absolutely in the right. They 
are using "Whitewater-gate" to reduce Clinton's political clout 
and block reforms like those in health care. They also are 
hoping to win seats in November's congressional elections. 
  Will Whitewater be the proverbial banana skin on which 
Clinton slips? Is it certain that the President and his wife 
were involved in a financial scandal in the period when Clinton 
was governor in Arkansas? It is unclear how deeply the couple 
have gotten themselves in a jam. Moreover it is doubtful 
whether the investigation by the independent prosecutor will 
yield criminal evidence. 
  All the same Clinton and his staff have operated in an 
exceptionally clumsy way. The fact that people are talking 
about Whitewater-gate is the result of the Clintons' failing 
personnel policy. They surround themselves with friends whose 
quality is open to discussion. Bernard Nussbaum, the dismissed 
financial advisor, is just such a good friend, but a bungling 
lawyer. 
  Peace will only return to the White House when the Clintons 
replace their pals, like the weak chief of staff Thomas McLarty, 
with political professionals. Keeping a tidy ship means not 
only being open in the Whitewater investigations, but also doing 
away with amateurism.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Asia Flexes Its Muscles"] </F>
  [Text] Most people in the West today are well aware of the 
economic rise of the Asian tigers. But recent events emphasise 
a parallel growth of political assertiveness in the East. 
Britain's disputes with Malaysia over the Pergau Dam, and with 
China over Hong Kong, are only the most conspicuous examples of 
a wider trend. It is less that Asian sentiments towards the 
West have changed than that there is now a willingness 
forcefully to express them. They believe, and are prepared to 
declare, that they are the masters now. 
  As Asia's economic growth has increased, there has been a 
flexing of political muscle. Alongside that, in the cases of 
both Malaysia and China, is the rankling legacy of the colonial 
era. The Malaysians resent criticism from the press of the old 
colonial overlord. Behind China's resistance to greater 
democracy in Hong Kong lies not only the paranoia of an ageing 
communist dictatorship, but a fierce resentment that Britain 
should seek to impose unilaterally -- on territory seized from 
China by force during that not altogether creditable episode in 
our history, the Opium Wars -- a system of government which it 
has reason to fear. The readiness with which Beijing has fallen 
back on crude anti-colonialist rhetoric, after a period of 
co-operation during the Eighties, suggests that in the emerging 
Asian superpower old resentments run deep. As that malign 
slogan of a malign old man, Mao Zedong, had it: Remember past 
bitterness. 
  In the case of the old Soviet Union during the Cold War 
scholars cudgelled their brains to work out how much of its 
behaviour could be attributed to ideological and how much to 
nationalist factors. The case of China is simpler. It is a 
historically aggrieved power, whose revolution was as much 
nationalist as communist, with a profound sense of its own 
uniqueness and cultural superiority inherited from a 4,000-year 
history. Such a power will glory in, but not be satisfied by, 
mere material growth. The possibility of a more liberal Chinese 
society remains very uncertain. 
  Yet, even if there were progress towards democracy, we 
should 
not expect China to divest itself of its accumulated grievances 
overnight. One could even argue that the greater China's 
political maturity, the more nationally assertive it is likely 
to become, as the world opens its doors. Whatever the future, 
the traumas of two centuries of humiliation, real or perceived, 
will take time to heal. 
  The West will increasingly be irked and exasperated by 
Asia's 
new self-confidence, and sometimes truculence. The Pergau Dam 
will not be the last issue in which British political 
sensitivities become entangled with overseas trade. Our 
response will require a delicate balance between receptiveness 
to foreign feelings and a determination to stand by our own 
values. It does no harm to remind ourselves that Asia needs 
Western markets every bit as badly as the West needs those of 
Asia. It will get us nowhere to abase ourselves before 
temperamental potentates. But we shall do well to keep clearly 
in mind the rawness of their societies' nerve-ends about history 
which we have put behind us, but they have not.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "G-7: Blueprint for Greater Yeltsin </F>
Presence"] 
  [Text] Naples, 9 Mar (ANSA) -- The participation of Boris 
Yeltsin in discussions underway during the three-day Group of 
Seven summit in Naples, July 8-10, will not be restricted to a 
widened parley tacked on at the end -- as happened at the Tokyo 
summit last year -- but instead, would see the Russian president 
fully involved in discussions on at least half of the summit 
agenda, according to a press statement released here today at 
the end of a preparatory meeting. 
  Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, in presenting the summit logo 
here Monday [7 March], said that Italy as G-7 president was 
working at a diplomatic level for greater Russian involvement in 
political discussions at the July gathering. 
  While awaiting the nod from the other members of the G-7 
club 
of leading industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, 
Germany, France, Britain, and Canada -- Italy is going ahead 
with its organization of the summit and is making it possible, 
in the event the others do agree, that Yeltsin, who is to arrive 
in Naples on Saturday morning of the second day of the summit, 
could take part in the G-7 sessions as early as Saturday 
afternoon, July 9. 
  In any case, the evening of Saturday, July 9, Yeltsin will 
take part in an official dinner being offered to all 
participants by the Italian premier, in the presence of Head of 
State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 
  The plan is for Yeltsin to take part Sunday morning in the 
final work session and at the subsequent presentation of the 
results of the summit. 
  However, Ciampi's office today specified that no definitive 
decision had yet been taken with regard to how and when Yeltsin 
would be taking part in the Naples parley. A decision will be 
made by the Seven shortly before the summit opens, according to 
the same source. 
  Meanwhile, it was learned here that Ciampi would take part 
in 
the opening session of G-7 environmental ministers set for March 
12 and 13 in Florence. 
  The meeting was convened by Italian Environment Minister 
Valdo Spini last year because, as he said today, the 
industrialized nations have a special responsibility to promote 
sustainable development for the entire planet. However, Spini 
also highlighted the role that the environment could play in 
creating jobs within the big industrialized states.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [9 March], FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel opened a meeting with the foreign 
ministers of the three Baltic states Estonia, Latvia, and 
Lithuania in Bonn with the urgent recommendation that they 
integrate their Russian minorities. This recommendation was 
primarily addressed to Estonia and Latvia, since this problem 
with minorities does not exist in Lithuania. Solving the 
problem is of "outstanding importance for the future of the 
relations with Russia as a whole," Kinkel said. 
  Kinkel assured all three republics of German support for the 
gradual approach to the European Union and the Western European 
Union with the final goal of full membership. Closer 
cooperation is also to be striven for with NATO. Promoting a 
better relationship between the Baltic States and Russia was the 
central topic of the meeting, with which the foreign ministers 
of the Baltic Sea republics met with Kinkel in Germany for the 
first time. 
  Kinkel stressed the "particularly close relationship" both 
with the Baltic States and with Russia. At the beginning of the 
meeting, he stressed that the date of 31 August 1994 for the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia must be 
observed and that there are no reasons for delay. Estonia was 
represented by Juri Luik, Latvia by Georgs Andrejevs, and 
Lithuania by Povilas Gylys.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "East Europe Nuclear Risks Demand </F>
U.S./EU Plan, Ansaldo Says"] 
  [Text] Rome, 9 Mar (ANSA) -- At least 25 East European 
nuclear power stations must be dismantled by the year 2000 if 
the West wants to avert a new Chernobyl, the 
government-controlled engineering group Ansaldo warned today, 
calling for an "Energy Marshall Plan" to be set up by the United 
States and the European Union [EU]. 
  Bruno Musso, chief executive of the main plant construction 
arm of IRI's [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] vast 
Finmeccanica engineering sub-group, painted an alarming picture 
of the situation in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Slovakia and 
Bulgaria. Of the 58 nuclear plants in Central and East Europe, 
he said, 15 are of the same RBMK type as Chernobyl, with 
obsolete cooling systems using normal water. Pointing to 
"worrying" basic design faults, Musso said these plants "should 
be shut down as soon as possible." 
  Another 43 plants use the slightly more modern VVER 
technology, with cooling by pressurized water. Of these, the 
oldest 10 should be closed, while 23 must be Westernized to 
improve efficiency and safety, Musso said. The closures would 
mean a fall in energy supplies in the former Soviet bloc of at 
least 20,000 megawatts out of a total of 45,500. 
  Musso contended that the situation is "critical" because of 
the "two major problems that have to be reconciled": on the one 
hand, the safety demands of the Western world, which "can no 
longer afford to risk another Chernobyl"; and on the other, the 
economic needs of the Eastern nations, which "cannot see vital 
energy cut off from one day to the next." For Lithuania alone, 
he said, shutting the old power station at Ignalina would mean a 
45 percent drop in the country's electricity supplies. 
  He thus launched a proposal embracing the two areas. "The 
United States, in a confidential report, has declared its 
willingness to buy the enriched uranium in the nuclear bombs of 
the former Soviet Union; these resources, together with other 
funding from the European Union, could be used for modernising 
the less obsolete plants, restoring efficiency in the multi-fuel 
plants, and building new sites." 
  These combined efforts should be enough to close the energy 
gap caused by the cuts, also opening up interesting business 
prospects for construction and engineering firms like Ansaldo, 
which last month set up a company in Moscow with the Russian 
energy agency. 
  Ansaldo's participation in the restructuring programme he 
envisages, Musso said, could boost the company's turnover from 
nuclear projects from 70 billion lire at present to 300 billion 
in 1995, a figure he described as "very satisfactory." 
  He said that Ansaldo is thinking of asking the Italian 
foreign ministry to have the problem of East European nuclear 
plants formally placed on the agenda of the July Group of Seven 
summit in Naples.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Twelve Call For a Reinforcement of </F>
UNPROFOR"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] At their debate on Monday [7 March] evening on 
former Yugoslavia under Common Foreign and Security Policy, the 
foreign ministers of the Twelve insisted on the need to 
reinforce United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) troops in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. France first and foremost, speaking through 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, had urged in favour of increasing 
the number of blue helmets in Bosnia. The French view is that 
reinforcements should be provided by the Twelve but also by the 
United States. Speaking to the press, Mr. Papoulias, however, 
refused to say whether any of the other EC countries have so far 
stated their willingness to actively participate in this further 
effort considered necessary. Mr. Juppe, for his part, pointed 
out that France (which already has the largest contingent of 
blue helmets) had "done its duty." The French Minister, 
moreover, launched an appeal to his European partners to 
reintegrate the Serbs into the peace process. "Peace will not 
be achieved with two parties when there are three in the 
conflict," he said speaking of the recent agreement reached 
between Croats and Muslims on the creation of a two-sided 
federation in Bosnia. The Twelve also stressed the growing 
importance of the role henceforth played by the United States 
and Russia in bringing peace to Bosnia while recalling that the 
European Union could not see itself reduced to an "inferior 
role" as Mr. Papoulias had stated, before going on to say that 
the EC is "interested" in strengthened diplomatic activity by 
the United States and Russia in the peace process, "but it still 
wishes to keep to its peace plan."

<F P=106> [Helen Vogt report: "Fisheries Agreement in Sight in </F>
Brussels"; as released by the TIETOTEHDAS Database] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Norway and the EU [European Union] have 
finally taken the bull by the horns and begun to discuss fish 
quotas. This morning both the Norwegian negotiators and EU 
diplomats were taking an optimistic view of the possibility of 
reaching an agreement. 
  Trade Minister Grete Knudsen and Fisheries Minister Jan 
Henry 
T. Olsen had an hour-long meeting with EU Commissioner President 
Jacques Delors and Greek European Affairs Minister Theodhoros 
Pangalos. At the meeting Norway put forward new proposals for 
how the interests of Spain and Portugal can be satisfied in the 
negotiations. Both countries have demanded fish quotas from 
Norway. The outcome of the meeting was that representatives of 
the Commission and Norwegian officials were set to work to draft 
proposals for fisheries which will be put before the EU foreign 
ministers. 
<H5>  Perhaps a Fish? </H5>
  "The position of the Norwegian side is founded on a clear 
principle. The EU is very well aware of this. But we are not 
opposed to lending a hand so that the interests of Spain, 
Portugal, and Ireland can be taken into account. What is clear 
is that there cannot be a solution for Norway alone," a 
Norwegian negotiator said. Norway understands that Spain and 
Portugal feel themselves to have been badly treated in their own 
accession agreements in the fisheries sector, but it has been an 
important point for the Norwegians to get the EU to understand 
that Norway cannot atone for the EU's old sins in this field. 
The Norwegian negotiators have also made it very clear that 
they will not allow themselves to be pressured into giving 
anything extra in the fisheries negotiations in order to make it 
easier for the EU countries to get Spain to agree to a solution 
to the internal wrangle about voting rules in the Council of 
Ministers. "If such pressure is put on Norway, we have made it 
clear that we have nothing more to talk about," a Norwegian 
source said. 
<H5>  Agriculture Agreed </H5>
  According to NORSK TELEGRAMBYRA'S information, the 
agricultural agreement between Norway and the EU is complete and 
will be made public as soon as it has been formally approved by 
the EU Council of Ministers. In the last few days of 
negotiations, the Norwegians believe that they have succeeded in 
achieving a better deal for the food industry than Finland 
achieved last week. In concrete terms, measures will be adopted 
to prevent the market from disappearing while the food 
processing industry restructures in order to adapt itself to the 
new pricing situation. The measures will only apply to a 
limited number of sensitive products and will only apply for a 
transitional period.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl has blamed 
Spain and Great Britain for the preliminary failure of Norway's 
negotiations for membership in the European Union [EU]. It is 
"completely inexplicable" for the Federal Government and him 
personally that, in view of the outstanding political importance 
of this question for Europe, member countries have not endorsed 
the consensus, the chancellor stated in Bonn on Wednesday [9 
March]. 
  In the question of fishery, a package that had exactly taken 
Madrid's interests into account was presented. "I hope that 
Spain will endorse this balanced proposal." In the controversy 
over the blocking minority, the EU presidency presented a 
"reasonable proposal." He hopes that Great Britain will still 
agree to it. According to Kohl, the Federal Government sticks to 
the objective of admiting all four countries -- Austria, Sweden, 
Finland, and Norway -- to the European Union in January 1995. 
He appealed to the still hesitant member countries to clear the 
road for the conclusion of the negotiations for membership now.

<F P=106> [Announcement by David Hunt, secretary of state for </F>
employment, on UK "Formal Challenge" to the EU Working Time 
Directive on 7 March: "Britain Challenges Brussels in European 
Court Over Working Hours"] 
  [Text] "I have today issued the Government's challenge to 
the Working Time Directive in the European Court. The UK 
strongly opposes any attempt to tell people that they can no 
longer work the hours they want. This measure is not about 
health and not about safety, it is a flagrant abuse of Community 
rules. It has been brought forward as such simply to allow 
majority voting -- a ploy to smuggle through part of the Social 
Chapter by the back door. 
  ``We have a very strong case. The rules in the Directive on 
annual holidays, working on Sunday, the 48-hour week, and the 
rest are totally irrelevant to the proper control of health and 
safety at work. The European Court should throw out the 
Directive lock, stock and barrel. 
  ``Although in long and hard negotiations we won very 
substantial concessions on all our key concerns, the Directive 
would still introduce bureaucratic rules and restrictions where 
none are needed. 
  ``There can be no question of us implementing any part of 
the 
Directive in advance of our case being decided. 
  ``The United Kingdom has one of the best health and safety 
records in Europe. We have never considered it necessary to 
place arbitrary limits on working hours on health and safety or 
any other grounds. 
  ``Europe must turn its back on unnecessary and unjustified 
regulations. The real problem is unemployment; getting people 
back to work. We won't create jobs with more red tape or by 
introducing rigidities into the world of work. There is only 
one way to get unemployment down and that is to free up the 
labour market and discard unnecessary controls.'' 
<H5>  Notes To Editors: </H5>
  The Working Time Directive was proposed by the European 
Commission in 1990 under Article 118a of the Treaty of Rome as a 
health and safety measure, which means that unlike other 
Directives dealing with employment terms and conditions it is 
subject to Qualified Majority Voting. 
  The Directive includes measures for minimum daily and weekly 
rest periods (which are to include Sunday "in principle"), 4 
weeks annual paid holidays, a limit on the working week to 48 
hours except by voluntary agreement, and restrictions on night 
work. It excludes transport, work at sea and doctors in training 
from scope and allows for derogations from its requirements in 
certain circumstances, for example under collective agreement 
arrangements, or when there is a need for continuity of service 
or production. 
  During negotiations, the UK achieved major changes: Member 
States may now follow a voluntary approach to the 48 hour week, 
and can decide whether to include Sunday in the weekly rest 
period. Derogations would also be allowed for local or 
enterprise level collective agreements as well as national level 
agreements. 
  The Directive was formally adopted by the Commission in 
November 1993 and Member States have three years from that date 
to implement it. The government has made it clear that there is 
no question of implementing the Directive in advance of the 
legal challenge being decided.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy Ready To Block European Union </F>
Budget Over Milk Quota Issue"] 
  [Text] Verona, 9 Mar (ANSA) -- For the second time in two 
days, Italy on Wednesday [9 March] threatened to veto the 
European Union's [EU] budget, citing excessive burdens on its 
own finances caused by fines to be paid for exceeding milk 
production quotas. 
  Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Verona 
agricultural fair, Agriculture Minister Alfredo Diana said he 
did not rule out that Rome may wield the threat of a budget veto 
if EU farm ministers agree with a Commission proposal not to 
grant Italy an increase in its milk production quotas, as agreed 
to last year. 
  "Each one uses the weapons at his disposal," Diana said. 
  Italy will have to pay about one trillion lire (595 million 
dollars) in fines for having exceeded its production quotas from 
1989 to 1991 and cannot take on additional financial burdens, 
Diana said, referring to threats of a budget veto issued 
yesterday by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta. 
  "This is not blackmail but an evaluation of the domestic 
budget made by Minister Andreatta," Diana said, adding that a 
compromise solution to the Union's budget requirements and 
Italy's agricultural problems will have to be found. 
  Andreatta yesterday cited "general policy reservations" in 
barring implementation of the European Union budget reform that 
had been agreed on at the Edinburgh summit of 1992. 
  EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday failed to 
approve the budget reform, which would base contributions on 
gross domestic product and in inverse proportion to value added 
tax rates. 
  Andreatta said the way Italy now calculates its GDP puts it 
at a disadvantage compared to other member states that have not 
yet carried out the budget reforms, changing the way production 
levels are estimated. Italy claims the discrepancy would force 
it to pay as much as one trillion lire in additional budget 
contributions. 
  Rome also argues that failing to increase Italy's milk 
production quotas may cost it as much as five trillion lire 
(2.97 billion dollars). Italy believes the EU has not moved 
quickly enough on agricultural reform where Mediterranean 
products are concerned and that further negotiations are needed 
on agro-monetary realignment.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "East Europe: EU Proposes Regular </F>
Contacts at All Levels for Associate Countries"; as released by 
Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] The European Union [EU] intended proposing Tuesday 
[8 March] evening at its first meeting under multilateral 
political dialogue (whose principle was established by the 
Copenhagen Summit of 21 and 22 June 1993) among itself and the 
six "associated" countries of Central and East Europe, a series 
of practical modalities enabling dialogue to develop with them 
on questions of foreign and security policy. The Council of the 
Union, responding to the call by the European Council of 
Copenhagen with a view to establishing a "structured 
relationship" between the Union and Central and East European 
countries, suggests that: 

  -  in principle once a year, a 
meeting between the presidents of the European Council and 
Commission be arranged with the Heads of State and Government of 
the associated countries; 
  -  the Union presidency should inform the 
ambassadors of the associated countries after each European 
Council; 
  -  as envisaged by the European Council of Copenhagen, 
there be a special Council convened with the Foreign Ministers 
of the associated countries once per presidency of the Union to 
look at problems involving the CFSP [Common Foreign and Security 
Policy]. The agenda will be thoroughly prepared in order to 
cover matters of common interest with a view to arrive as much 
as possible at common operational conclusions and to accommodate 
specific concerns of the associated countries. Further meetings 
in Troika format may also be held at the discretion of the 
presidency; 
  -  once a presidency, as envisaged in Copenhagen, there 
be a meeting between the political directors, in the form of a 
special session of the Political Committee, preferable before 
each regular European Council. At this level too, the 
presidency will be able to convene meetings with the Troika on 
specific issues of an urgent character; 
  -  the convening of 
meetings at expert level with the associated countries, once a 
presidency, including groups active in security, terrorism and 
human rights. These meetings could also be held at Troika 
level, and the agenda concentrate on questions of common 
interest; 
  -  meetings at expert level with the Associated countries 
once per Presidency will be extended to other groups including 
security, terrorism, planners and human rights working groups. 
These meetings may be in Troika format, or with all partners 
present immediately after regular sessions. In every case the 
agenda should be organised so as to focus on matters of common 
interest; 
  -  in appropriate cases, the Associated countries will be 
invited through an agreed mechanism publicly to align themselves 
jointly with European Union declarations on a particular 
subject; 
  -  when certain demarches are made by the Troika, 
Associated countries could be invited to support them; 
  -  the 
Associated countries could be invited to associate themselves 
jointly with the implementation of joint actions, if 
appropriate; 
  -  cooperation with the Associated countries in 
international organisations and in the run up to and during 
international conferences should be intensified. They will be 
invited to coordinate their position with the European Union 
whenever appropriate; 
  -  to facilitate coordination between 
themselves and the European Union, the Associated countries are 
invited to appoint Shadow European Correspondents. In addition 
they should be invited to nominate contact points for CFSP 
issues in their missions to the European Union which should 
establish regular contacts with their counterparts in the Member 
States' missions and the Commission as well as with the Council 
Secretariat; 
  -  regular contacts between the EU missions in third 
countries and at headquarters of international organisations and 
conferences and missions of the Associated countries shall be 
encouraged; 
  -  the European Union shall examine the possibility of 
further cooperation between the administrations of the 
diplomatic services of Member States, the Commission and of the 
Associated countries. The European Union notes that in some 
cases the modalities of cooperation between the Associated 
countries and the European Union might require the Associated 
countries to nominate a single representative. In particular, 
the Associated countries are invited to establish a system 
providing for a single representative on rotation for 
coordination purposes. The European Union considers that the 
meetings provided for should focus on specific questions which 
need an in-depth discussion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Poland: Mr. Olechowski Will </F>
Recommend a Request for `Partial Membership' When Hungary 
Applies"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] The Foreign Minister of Poland, Andrzej Olechowski, 
has announced his intention to recommend that his government 
submit an application for membership in the European Union at 
the same time as Hungary. He nevertheless said the solution of 
"partial membership" would be more realistic for his country 
because complete adherence to the Union's economic pillar (the 
first) would involve "costs and delays." In contrast, he hopes 
Poland can be integrated into the two other pillars (CFSP 
[Common Foreign Security Policy] and Home Affairs) as soon as 
possible so as to "prepare for subsequent full membership." At 
a restricted press conference the day after the first session of 
the EC/Poland Association Council, Mr. Olechowski underscored 
the favourable and rapid development of the country's main 
economic indicators, which today makes it possible for Poland to 
envisage "giving tangible form to its desire for membership in 
the European Union." Following a period of recession, the 
Polish economy registered growth of 4.5 percent in 1993, i.e. 
the highest in Europe (East and West alike), due to growth in 
the industrial sector (7 percent to 10 percent) which is itself 
based on a sharp rise in productivity. 
  Poland has also managed to slash inflation from 600 percent 
in 1990 to 30 percent. The country has some two million private 
companies and 60 percent of the workforce is employed in the 
private sector. The most striking development may be the 
shrinking of the public sector, which provided the earnings of 
60 percent of Polish households two years ago, compared to only 
35 percent today, he noted. 
  Political developments are also encouraging. Mr. Olechowski 
said that Poland's democratic institutions are "surprisingly 
mature." These promising signs make it possible for Poland to 
aspire to "political membership" enabling it to participate in 
the development of the common foreign and security policy and 
intergovernmental cooperation in home and justice affairs. 
"This would certainly be a much more convincing and effective 
solution than, for example, a partnership or another form of 
relations," he told the Association Council. With respect to 
the Union's economic sphere, Mr. Olechowski said that "waiting 
periods and derogations" would be necessary, in particular for 
the integration of Polish agriculture and participation in EMU 
[European Monetary Union]. Regarding agriculture, he recalled 
that this sector still employs 25 percent of the workforce in 
Poland, adding that a reduction in terms of jobs and, in 
general, an "adjustment" would have to be undertaken in the long 
term. In these circumstances, full membership seems 
"impossible" and partial membership "interesting." For Mr. 
Olechowski, it would be preferable to set a timetable with 
objectives and deadlines at the earliest opportunity so as to 
more clearly target the adjustments required, "giving a sense of 
commitment" and "conferring credibility to our objective of full 
membership. Partial membership would be the proof that the 
wider Europe is not a pure figment of the imagination but a 
project already underway," he added. The minister commented 
that Poland could promote this approach beginning in the latter 
half of this year, when Germany takes over the rotating 
Presidency of the Council of the Union. In his view, this 
Presidency will be "particularly open to the questions raised by 
its neighbours." Mr. Olechowski regretted that the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia cannot join in the membership movement 
launched by their Visegrad Group partners. The minister was to 
meet NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner later on Tuesday [8 
March], along with the President of the Western European Union 
[WEU] Jacques Poos and its Secretary General Wim Eekelen. 
Membership in the WEU must also be considered an integral part 
of the process of Poland's integration into the European Union.

this comment at a press conference, adding that conditions for 
membership have become more stringent following the Community's 
"metamorphosis" into a Union. "We cannot apply for membership 
tomorrow or the next day.... We are waiting to be ripe," he 
added. Mr. Havel did not express a view on the advisability of 
"partial" membership (to the second and third pillars, for 
example) but underscored his country's will to participate in 
political dialogue with the EU.

conference that the foreign ministers of the European Union [EU] 
will meet again next Tuesday [15 March], because "we do not give 
up so quickly." Kinkel regretted that the breakthrough "in the 
vexatious fishing issue" has failed because of Spain. It is not 
justified to speak of a crisis, even in view of the differences 
of opinion with Great Britain concerning the majorities in a 
16-member EU. Kinkel appealed to the European Parliament in 
Strasbourg not to let the procedure for membership fail because 
of the pressure of time before the new elections. He is 
convinced that the negotiations with Norway will be concluded 
successfully.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [9 March], FRG Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) received his 
Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev with military honors in the 
Defense Ministry in Bonn. Grachev has come for a three-day visit 
to the Bundeswehr to Germany. Immediately after the welcoming 
ceremony, the two ministers began an extensive exchange of 
views, during which they particularly want to sound out the 
possibilities for even closer cooperation between the Bundeswehr 
and the Russian Army. 
  Further topics are the forthcoming withdrawal of the Russian 
forces form Germany and NATO's offer of a Partnership for Peace 
to the East European states. During Ruehe's visit to Moscow 
last April an agreement was signed, which envisages close 
military policy relations between the two countries, varied 
contacts, and the exchange of officers. In autumn 1993, Russian 
generals attended a seminar in Germany. 
  Relations between the Russian Armed Forces and the 
Bundeswehr 
have developed well, it was stressed by Defense Ministry circles 
on Wednesday. There are no major problems. Ruehe advocates as 
intensive as possible an exchange of information. The Russian 
military officers must be given the opportunity to gather 
experiences in the West. The German minister had been an early 
advocat of opening up the Western alliance toward East Europe. 
  Grachev also wants to brief Ruehe on the state of the 
withdrawal of the Western Group of Russian Forces from eastern 
Germany. According to experts, the withdrawal is taking place 
according to plan. At the end of August, a total of 22 division 
with 546,000 Russian military members and 2.6 million tonnes of 
material are supposed to have been withdrawn from eastern 
Germany. More than 90 percent of the withdrawal have already 
been concluded. In the treaty on the withdrawal Bonn provided 
8.35 billion German marks to build 36,000 apartments in Russia 
for the returning soldiers. 
  Grachev also wants to visit Bundeswehr units in northern and 
eastern Germany. At the conclusion of his stay in Germany, he 
and Ruehe will lay wreaths at the Soviet memorial and at the 
memorial for 20 July 1944 in the inner yard of the Bendler Block 
in Berlin on Friday.

  [Text] Brussels -- Bavaria's Minister President Edmund 
Stoiber (Christian Social Union) has accused Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party) of "narrow-minded 
nationalism" in European policies. As an example, he cited the 
discussion about the bugging of private residences, which is 
possible in all other European countries. "In Brussels, our 
great Europeans suddenly turn into completely narrow-minded 
people who insist on national competences," Stoiber stressed at 
a news conference in Brussels today, referring to the negative 
attitude of the Free Democratic Party on the issue of the 
bugging campaign. 
  Stoiber accused Kinkel of preventing a standardization of 
the 
export regulations for goods that can be used for military and 
civilian purposes. Germany is the only country to reject that. 
Thus, there is the danger that German industry might transfer 
its activities to other countries of the European Union. 
  A corresponding guideline for the so-called dual-use goods 
is 
currently under discussion. Since Germany has the strictest 
export regulations within the European Union for such products, 
Bonn insist on relative strict export regulations but is ready 
for concessions vis-a-vis other countries, experts have stated.

  [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- The North Rhine-Westphalian 
Interior Ministry wants to cancel the first flight deporting 
refugees to Serbia, which is planned for this Thursday [10 
March], if the FRG Interior Ministry is not able to clarify 
whether agreements concluded with the Romanian authorities are 
still valid. The ministry announced this in Duesseldorf in 
Wednesday. 
  On Thursday, about 100 refugees from what remains of 
Yugoslavia are to be flown from Duesseldorf to the Romanian 
border airport of Timisoara, and then taken by bus to the 
Serbian border. Three additional special flights have been 
agreed on with the Romanian state airline Tarom for this month. 
About 500 asylum-seekers, illegal immigrants, criminals, and 
refugees with expired residence permits are to be deported from 
North Rhine-Westphalia to Serbia.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has concluded 
its investigation of the contentious antiterrorism operation in 
Bad Kleinen and, as a result, primarily wants to restructure the 
Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA]. 
  At the Wednesday [9 March] presentation of the final report 
about the 27 June 1993 operation, during which GSG-9 officer 
Michael Newrzella and suspected RAF [Red Army Faction] terrorist 
Wolfgang Grams were killed, Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) expressly stated his trust in BKA 
President Hans-Ludwig Zachert, who has been criticized in 
connection with this operation. Zachert will continue to head 
the BKA in Wiesbaden and will also keep the ultimate authority 
to make decisions in the case of a future "leadership 
characterized by teamwork" with the stronger inclusion of the 
Interior Ministry in Bonn. 
  At a news conference in Bonn, which was attended by Justice 
Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (Free Democratic 
Party of Germany), Chief Federal Prosecutor Kay Nehm, as well as 
Zachert himself, Interior Minister Kanther stressed that the 
Federal Government is "certain" that the most important 
questions arising from the operation in Bad Kleinen have been 
answered "finally and completely." Kanther said the finding 
that Grams committed suicide after killing Newrzella is 
"absolutely certain." There are no indications supporting the 
version that Grams was "executed." 
  The defects during and after the operation, which had 
already 
been listed in the interim report, have been confirmed, the 
minister added. The mistakes have overshadowed the "many things 
that have been achieved by devoted police work" in the public 
discussion. Bad Kleinen was, however, also a "lesson" for 
everyone involved regarding the need for information by the 
public and by parliament on large-scale police operations. 
  BKA President Zachert stressed his agreement with the 
minister on plans for an organizational reform of the BKA. Many 
measures, which are now to be implemented, had been discussed 
long before the operation. Kanther cited the reduction to nine 
departments, the merging of the departments for left-wing and 
right-wing terrorism in the BKA branch in Meckenheim (near 
Bonn), and a more intensive delegation of the president's 
international obligations to subordinate officials. 
  The justice minister and the chief federal prosecutor 
expressed satisfaction that the report does not accuse the 
authorities in Karlsruhe of any mistakes during the 
investigations. Referring to defects in passing on information, 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger once again defended the dismissal of 
then Chief Federal Prosecutor Alexander von Stahl: On the basis 
of how things were seen in July 1993, this was justified. There 
is no reason to revise the assessment. It is not necessary to 
extend the legal powers of the chief federal prosecutor's office 
as a result of Bad Kleinen. 
  Nehm rejected reports that liaison man Klaus Steinmetz, who 
was uncovered during the operation, was a member of the RAF 
command structure. His authority had a corresponding note from 
the BKA, but the suspicion had proved to be incorrect during 
subsequent investigations, the chief federal prosecutor said. 
The questions that had been raised have been "answered in such 
a way that no criminal accusations against Steinmetz were made." 
  Ulla Jelpke, internal affairs spokeswoman of the Party of 
Democratic Socialism Bundestag Group, criticized the fact that 
the government's final report does not eliminate many 
incongruities about Grams's death. She accused the authorities 
of "biased investigations": While statements by witnesses that 
incriminated officers involved in the operation were assessed 
critically, the investigators assessed statements by policemen 
who were "under suspicion of committing murders" in an 
"extremely favorable manner."

  [Text] Rome, 9 Mar (ANSA) -- Whoever wins the elections 
will need to carry out further adjustments to correct overruns 
in public spending, said Massimo Russo, the International 
Monetary Fund's chief for Europe, in the course of an interview 
on GR2 radio [second channel radio news]. 
  "We said in December that very likely the budget objectives 
for 1994 would not be met and that new measures would have to be 
taken within the year," said Russo. "We are now confirming that 
opinion, which is widely shared," he said. 
  He also said he believed the elections were weighing on 
Italy's economy, and that "political uncertainties have to be 
clarified before a full-scale recovery can take place." 
  "The U.S. recovery reflects the fact that recession began 
there first and now the country is recovering. The rate of 
recovery is good but not exceptional; for Europe the timing is 
slower," Russo said. 
  Italy's gross domestic product should grow 1-1.1 percent, 
"as 
predicted in December," he added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Suspected Bribes to De Michelis, </F>
Bernini"] 
  [Text] Venice, 8 Mar (ANSA) -- Magistrates who on Monday [7 
March] requested the indictments of former Socialist Foreign 
Minister Gianni De Michelis and ex-Christian Democrat Transport 
Minister Carlo Bernini suspect them of having accepted bribes of 
500 million and 340 million lire (295,000 and 201,000 dollars) 
respectively, according to judicial sources here. 
  The bribes, said the sources, were paid for public bids to 
build a freeway linking the Venice-Padua highway to the Marco 
Polo airport of Venice. 
  De Michelis and Bernini are among five members of parliament 
who may face charges of corruption and violation of party 
financing laws for their alleged involvement in kickbacks for 
public bids in the northern Veneto region. 
  (Barbara Coelin, De Michelis' former secretary, told Milan 
magistrates she received "envelopes" from several businessmen, 
including former Montedison chairman Carlo Sama, which, "for the 
way they were given to me, the instructions I received and the 
discretion I was told to use, I could understand they contained 
money," according to transcripts of the questioning, which took 
place in Switzerland on March 2.) 
  The other MPs are former Christian Democrat treasurer 
Severino Citaristi, another Christian Democrat Senator, Pietro 
Montressori, and Socialist MP Raimondo Galluppo. 
  The public works projects under investigation by the Venice 
public prosecutors include pesticide cleanups in several Veneto 
provinces and a pollution cleanup project just outside Venice. 
  De Michelis was the most powerful Socialist politician in 
Venice before being implicated in a number of corruption probes; 
Bernini was a local heavyweight in the Christian Democrat party 
who has also been involved in a series of investigations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Six Detention Warrants Looming in </F>
Lentini Case"] 
  [Excerpts] Milan, 9 Mar (ANSA) -- Six persons including the 
chairman and two managers of [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi's advertising arm Publitalia were reported by a 
Berlusconi channel today as being the objects of preventive 
detention requests in a case of alleged false invoices to cover 
a 6.5 billion lire kickback in the world record transfer of 
soccer star Gianluigi Lentini for an official 18 billion lire 
from Torino to AC Milan 18 months ago. 
  Revealing the names of Publitalia chairman Marcello 
Dell'Utri, Publitalia managers Valerio Gerardelli and Romano 
Luzzi, and "three external managers, a husband and wife named 
Onorabile and a certain Lecci," the flagship Fininvest Canale 5 
news admitted that it was "probably breaking the law" but 
stressed its intention was not to alert the named persons to 
take flight. 
  The news bulletin also referred in passing to "another three 
detention requests people have been talking about, for a case of 
alleged kickbacks involving the ENEL [National Electric Power 
Board] electricity agency." 
  "An unprecedented political attack...old and absolutely 
risible cases that could be cleared up in five minutes but are 
turned by the media into a looming dragnet," was the comment of 
the Fininvest owner, who stepped down from the helm of his 
media-to-retail empire when he took the political field with his 
Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement to beat the left in the March 
27-28 elections. 
  "This is an offence to the intelligence and rights of 
millions of Italians...(whom) Forza Italia calls on to punish 
with their votes those who would transform a clean-up by 
magistrates into a sad case of the political use of the judicial 
system," said the pre-election poll leader, who is also the AC 
Milan chairman. 
  Reacting to "the reports of imminent arrest," Dell'Utri's 
lawyer said his client was "totally ready" to provide necessary 
clarification on the alleged false accounting, expressing the 
view that there was no need for preventive custody. 
  The preventive custody requests were reportedly on the desk 
of preliminary hearings judge Fabio Paparella, but no official 
decision had been announced. One of Paparella's reported 
options was to pass them on to colleague Anna Introini, who has 
been working for months on alleged "parallel accounting" within 
the Fininvest group. [passage omitted] 
  Fininvest issued a statement Wednesday evening [9 March] 
denying that Publitalia had ever issued false receipts and said 
it was the victim of a plot being orchestrated by certain 
factions in the judiciary and the press aimed at falsifying the 
election campaign. The statement stressed how only selected 
excerpts were being leaked by judicial sources to the press in 
an attempt to create a distorted picture of a judicial 
investigation "which could be clarified with extreme ease were 
there the will to do so." 
  According to Fininvest, the investigation being carried out 
by Secit and the Finance Guard was focused on company's 
supplying Publitalia and thus had no connection with the Clean 
Hands investigation into graft, bribery, illicit party funding a 
corruption in general. "All possible clarification can be made, 
in respect to civil rules, in the course of a tranquil 
conversation with the magistrate" the statement said, "there 
being the obvious readiness for the interested party to offer 
the most ample collaboration." 
  "However, the audacity to question a subject in a state of 
detention" the Fininvest statement stressed, "constitutes an 
illegal act of persecution which has the sole objective of 
falsifying the ongoing election campaign," against Fininvest 
owner Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia (Go Italy) 
movement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League leader Umberto Bossi </F>
by Gianluigi Da Rold; place and date not given: "Berlusconi? 
Maroni for Prime Minister"] 
  [Text] Milan -- What a strange couple, [Northern League 
leader] Bossi and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, the two 
roosters of the "pole for freedoms." They are so different as 
to seem like opposites -- and not only politically. 
  [Da Rold] Mr. Bossi, has this contrast not been deliberately 
studied in order to create a great force? Are you and 
Berlusconi playing a game? An attack Monday [7 March], a reply 
and an explanation Tuesday, so that all the newspapers and 
television talk about is you? 
  [Bossi] Definitely not. What is at stake here is clarity 
with respect to the voters. We are not selling washing powder. 
We have to clarify what the League is, what Forza Italia is, 
and what the pact means. True, there are some good things, 
because they emerge when revolutions take the right direction. 
But while some people want to move directly to the new, some 
would take the first side turning. 
  [Da Rold] People are confused after the things that you have 
said about Berlusconi. The opinion polls show you in a strong 
position. But further questions are arising, for instance about 
the next prime minister. 
  [Bossi] Not Berlusconi. And I will add nothing further to 
that. Even he should realize that. I repeat: It must be 
[League lower house floor leader] Roberto Maroni, a League 
member. Somebody asked me whether Berlusconi belongs to P2 
[outlawed Masonic lodge]. I said that that is what I read in 
the newspapers. Then I was asked whether a P2 member can become 
prime minister. And I said, and I still say, "no." 
  [Da Rold] But how much trust is there among you allies? 
  [Bossi] Let us be clear: Berlusconi is smart. But he is 
also unscrupulous, as I am, for that matter. So unscrupulous as 
to use different and conflicting tactics in order to win. 
However, the point is this: In the long term, Berlusconi is 
part of a blueprint for freedom. But only as long as the League 
is at the helm of change. 
  [Da Rold] What is your opinion of Berlusconi's promises? For 
instance, his pledge to create a million new jobs? 
  [Bossi] Well, we never make such promises. I am talking 
about selling detergent. Of course, it can be done on certain 
conditions. But to create a million jobs in such a disastrous 
situation seems to me definitely an old-fashioned way of waging 
the electoral battle. 
  [Da Rold] Are you, as a "pole," sure of being able to 
guarantee the country's governability? 
  [Bossi] Yes. The League's men who are governing in the major 
cities are demonstrating a great sense of commitment. They are 
honest people. We have a great contribution to make: 
pragmatism. 
  [Da Rold] So please be pragmatic too on the subject of trust 
among allies. Would you buy a used car from [Forza Italia 
economist] Antonio Martino? 
  [Bossi] I do not know him personally. So I cannot answer 
that. 
  [Da Rold] But would you sell Berlusconi a used car? 
  [Bossi] Well, yes... I am fairly honest in such matters 
relating to ordinary life. 
  [Da Rold] How will you succeed in "selling" Berlusconi 
federalism, the League's precious merchandise? 
  [Bossi] If in the proportional vote the North votes for the 
League, then there will be genuine economic liberalism. Within 
the "pole" there will be those whose task will be to moderate us 
with regard to the kind of federalism. But we must set the pace. 
  [Da Rold] Would you use the same argument with [National 
Alliance leader] Fini? 
  [Bossi] No, not Fini. The fascists can have no place in the 
country's future. They come from the darkness and obscurity of 
history. 
  [Da Rold] Tell me honestly, Senator. Do you think that 
Berlusconi has dimmed your political image? Do you feel like 
you have been scaled down? 
  [Bossi] I engage in politics because I believe in a certain 
ideal. I am not concerned about power. Berlusconi was born to 
attack the League and to join with the DC [Christian Democratic 
Party] and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. And thus to form the 
moderate pole. Set against the left-wing pole, that pole could 
permit itself to recycle the entire political class of the past. 
He has failed in this plan. They therefore tried to present us 
with a project involving Segni and Forza Italia and to force us 
into a corner. So first we pretended to form an alliance with 
Segni, then we returned him to sender, to the DC. Thus 
Berlusconi was left in a strait jacket, because of the 70 
percent of seats due to us. No, Berlusconi does not bother me. 
  [Da Rold] But is it true that you will soon be appearing on 
television partly because Berlusconi suggested that you do so? 
  [Bossi] Berlusconi cannot make any suggestions to me. I 
think that television is useful until the election campaign 
comes. Then the die is cast. It is the public, direct contact; 
people must experience you at close quarters in order to grant 
you their votes. It is not enough to make appearances covered in 
makeup, amid blue skies and clouds, like God Almighty, in order 
to gain votes. People will give you their votes if they can 
touch you and see that you are sincere. 
  [Da Rold] You are two strange people, you and Berlusconi -- 
different, but both with failed marriages behind you. And yet 
you both talk about the family in your programs and speeches. 
  [Bossi] I do not consider myself perfect. Not everything 
turns out perfectly. But I now feel that I have a wonderful 
family. And I am happy. 
  [Da Rold] Would you send your children to private schools? 
  [Bossi] I would indeed. They can play a major role in a 
modern state. I am thinking about the American universities, 
with a foundation next door. I am not thinking about state 
money, public money, for private education. I have in mind a 
qualitative role for private education. 
  [Da Rold] But would you go to a public hospital or to a 
private clinic? 
  [Bossi] There is no question. I am an expert on the subject. 
I would choose a public hospital. 
  [Da Rold] What awaits you at Pontida [League rally venue] on 
10 April, after the elections? 
  [Bossi] If nobody wins, a constituent legislature will 
inevitably be established. But I do not think that this will 
happen, so it could be a long legislative term. Pontida will be 
an occasion for celebration. Because the League will score a 
great victory.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Occhetto To Replace Craxi at </F>
Socialist International"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 9 Mar (ANSA) -- Achille Occhetto, head 
of the Democratic Party of the Left, should replace former 
Socialist Party leader Bettino Craxi as vice president of the 
Socialist International [SI], according to Glyn Ford, the Labor 
Party leader at the European Parliament. 
  Ford said the SI presidential office, at a meeting in Tokyo 
on May 10, will formally replace Craxi, who is mired in 
kickbacks scandals at home and is under investigation by 
magistrates in several cities on suspicion of violating party 
financing laws and receiving bribes. 
  The continued stay by Craxi as SI vice president has caused 
growing controversy in Italy. The Northern League yesterday 
criticized the Left Democrat Party, formerly the Italian 
Communist Party, for "not having raised objections" to having 
Italy represented in the organization by a discredited 
politician. The Left Democrats responded by noting they had 
already raised the issue with the SI president, Pierre Mauroy. 
  Today, Ford said Craxi will no longer hold any post in the 
SI 
and that the vice presidency should go to another Italian party 
affiliated to the organization; "the most appropriate person," 
he said, "is the party's secretary, Achille Occhetto." 
  Craxi was elected SI vice president in 1992, when he was 
still Socialist Party chief and just as the nation's bribery 
scandals were beginning to emerge. He now faces more than a 
dozen possible indictments.

<F P=106> [Article by Bruna Bellonzi and Alberto Sisto: "The Old Labor </F>
Leaders Are on Their Way Out"] 
  [Text] What are the prospects for uniting the labor unions? 
Changes in their top leadership are being forecast: changes that 
would favor rapprochement and mergers such as the peripheral 
organizations are now advocating. 
<H5>  Confindustria Also Participates </H5>
  "We welcome the prospect of labor union unity, and I would 
further state that by signing the Unitary Labor Union 
Representation accord we contributed to that unity." These are 
the words not of a labor union official but rather of 
Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] Vice 
President Carlo Callieri, who wants the industrialists to 
participate in the debate on labor union unity. This should come 
as no surprise. Labor appears to have lost some of its political 
connections and to be seeking a new identity in an attempt to 
reaffirm its status as a major player, in anticipation of the 
Second Republic. 
  The industrialists' organization accordingly wishes also to 
have its say, inasmuch as the renewed debate on the subject of 
labor unity has until now--at least as far as the top leaders of 
the labor confederations are concerned--consisted solely of 
reciprocal invitations, although an embryonic movement in favor 
of unity the can already be discerned within the craft unions 
and territorial organizations. 
  The face of unitary trade unionism has not yet taken shape, 
but it will definitely not bear any resemblance to either Bruno 
Trentin, Sergio D'Antoni, or Pietro Larizza. This is because the 
first step toward that goal will be taken in the factories and 
offices with the election of the unitary representatives--a 
process that is scheduled to begin within the next few weeks. 
  The embryos of unity that are becoming visible within some 
territorial organizations and craft unions do not yet project an 
image of this "new" federation. They take the form of meetings 
to study proposals with respect to unity such as those put 
forward by the Lombardian regional secretaries of the three 
labor confederations. These proposals include the creation of a 
single treasury, such as the Campania textile workers created 
when they paid their membership dues for 1944; the 
reconstitution of unitary directives, such as the commercial 
workers' unions have chosen to do; and nonaggression pacts, such 
as the one between textile workers and metalworkers in 
anticipation of the election of the RSU [Unified Trade Union 
Representatives]. 
  The textile workers will offer a single ticket at the RSU 
election, although the affiliation of the individual candidates 
will be indicated. The metalworkers, on the other hand, have 
decided that no one will be left without representation: If in a 
given factory or office one of the three confederations fails to 
elect a single representative, the other two will give it one of 
their seats. 
  The pensioners--who constitute at least half of the 
membership of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], 
CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions], and UIL [Italian 
Federation of Trade Unions]--have already scheduled a joint 
meeting for 15 February to consider a proposal to be presented 
for discussion by the rank and file. The proposal also contains 
initiatives that reveal a desire for unity but still do not 
confront the real issues. 
<H5>  The Obstacles </H5>
  In reality, what has taken place so far is more in the 
nature 
of a reorganization of the joint efforts made in recent years 
than the beginning of a process designed to achieve unity--a 
process that will face its share of difficulties. Despite the 
powerful incentives that motivate them, the pensioners 
themselves make no secret of the obstacles that their proposal 
is encountering even within their own ranks. 
<H5>  More Than a New Logo Under Discussion </H5>
  The obstacles are even greater at the next higher level in 
the labor union structure. The political obstacles remain, for 
although many of labor's political connections no longer have a 
name (for example, the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and PSI 
[Italian Socialist Party]), the respective visions of the kind 
of society in behalf of which the labor movement would like to 
struggle are still quite diverse. The organizational 
difficulties remain, because the problem as to whether the 
movement should represent basically its own membership or all 
workers has not yet been resolved. The internal structural 
difficulties also remain, because before a unified structure can 
be achieved, the respective leaderships must in any case not 
only be changed but reduced in size. According to CGIL 
Organizational Secretary Paolo Lucchesi, at least 30 percent of 
these leadership positions will have to be eliminated--no easy 
task. 
  But this is a problem for the distant future, like that of a 
new logo that will do justice to everyone. There is much more 
under discussion. When an adjective must be chosen to describe 
the new labor federation, what will the right word be? Or 
rather, what word will be acceptable to everyone? 
  No one has yet come up with that word. In negotiations with 
the other side, for example, will a strategy of conflict 
prevail, or one of cooperation? And will the prevailing concept 
be joint management or codetermination of policy? The CGIL 
leadership is quite cautious in designing the profile of the new 
entity which it seems inclined to create in cooperation with the 
other labor organizations. 
  Sergio Cofferati, who many say will succeed Bruno Trentin as 
the head of the most powerful of the labor confederations, will 
suggest only what the future organization should not be. "It 
should be a union organization devoid of any trace of a 
corporative structure, but instead characterized by a strong 
spirit of solidarity," he says. "Moreover," he adds, "this is a 
course that we have already begun to follow. There is no lack of 
examples: they range from the labor dispute with Olivetti to the 
agreement with Iveco of the FIAT Group and our proposals for 
negotiations in the automobile sector." This policy would appear 
to exclude COBAS [rank-and-file committees] and all other 
independent organizations, whose only reason for existence--and 
for opposing the confederations--is precisely the defense of 
special interests. 
  "Rather than unity," Piergiorgio Tiboni--secretary of FLMU, 
the independent union of metalworkers and mechanics--notes, 
"what the CGIL, CISL, and UIL have in mind is a single union, 
although they are ashamed to call it that. They obtained a 
reward from Confindustria: a reserve of 30 percent of the 
representatives, in each company, over and above the success of 
the individual slates, whereas these elections are precisely the 
occasion when the real strength and representativeness of each 
labor organization should be recorded!" 
<H5>  Representatives </H5>
  The CGIL has in fact officially renounced its quota. Trentin 
is insisting that the real representativeness of each 
organization be continually verified, and on this point even the 
internal minority--the "Be a Union" faction--is in agreement. 
Alfonso Gianni, one of the heirs of Fausto Bertinotti--who left 
the confederation because he was elected secretary of the 
Communist Renewal party--wants the accord concerning the RSU to 
be replaced by a law whereby the 30 percent reserve for the 
so-called more representative confederations would be abolished 
and every organization would fight on equal terms. To obtain 
this objective, Trentin and Gianni advocate a referendum to 
abolish the criterion of "greater representativeness," on the 
basis of which the representatives who have a voice at the 
negotiating table are currently selected. 
  In the unitary labor organization of the future, will there 
be a place for the extreme factions--for those who are still 
installed in the organs of the CGIL leadership or who while away 
their time in the CISL and are kept at bay in government jobs, 
for example, by D'Antoni's prestige? 
<H5>  The Problem of COBAS and the Independents Remains Unresolved </H5>
  "The impulse of solidarity and of conserving the existing 
system must reconciled," says Carlo Ghezzi, secretary of the 
Labor Chamber in Milan. "I do not rule out the possibility that 
some people will not be recognized in a new labor confederation. 
However, the clarification could come immediately, with the 
election of the RSU." 
  Cofferati is more cautious. "Unity does not mean a 
leveling," 
he says, "nor a disappearance of differences, either among the 
confederations or within the confederations." But neither does 
he want to deny that some segments of unions that represent 
radical positions could be lost along the way. "And not only 
leftist segments," he explains. The reconciliation has in fact 
already begun, and not just today. The first crack was opened 
with the signing of the accord of 3 July 1993 between the 
government and the corporate interests, and others developed 
during the difficult negotiations for the restructuring of large 
economic groups. 
  Codetermination of policy, rather than joint management, 
would certainly appear to be the keystone for managing processes 
that are painful and inevitable. And this may be precisely the 
basis for the welcome--and indeed the appreciation--that has 
been expressed by Confindustria.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondents Luis R. Aizpeolea and Anabel </F>
Diez] 
  [Text] Felipe Gonzalez is paying the price for having 
formed "too technocratic" a government. Gonzalez admitted as 
much Friday [11 February] during a rare, unscheduled news 
conference following the Council of Ministers--he had not called 
one in the last four years--and noted that although he had not 
called it for any special reason he intends to do it more often 
in the future. Gonzalez has told his close advisers to step up 
public appearances to make up for the invisibility of his 
government. He thinks that over the last seven months the 
cabinet has done a great many things, but has failed to get the 
message to the people. 
  Gonzalez and his advisers understand that as long as the 
economic situation does not improve, neither will popular 
perceptions of the work accomplished by his government, which at 
times seems very little. But the invisible government that 
Gonzalez put together in July has not made the task of allaying 
that impression any easier. 
  Gonzalez respects his ministers but has concluded they have 
only limited capacity to articulate and communicate the kind of 
political message which, in a time of recession and political 
complexity, is more essential than ever. Controversy over the 
alliance with the Catalonian nationalists, divisions among the 
socialists, and the confrontation with the unions are some of 
the most serious problems the prime minister has had to face. 
  Problems have been exacerbated by the absence from the 
Council of Ministers of two heavy hitters on whom Gonzalez was 
counting: Carlos Solchaga and Jose Luis Corcuera. The two highly 
combative ministers gave the government a certain gravitas it 
now lacks. Their replacements, Economy Minister Pedro Solbes, 
and Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion, have the image of 
technocrats. 
<H5>  Serra's Role </H5>
  Nor does Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra present the 
appearance of a political heavyweight, and tensions in the 
cabinet's bicephalous leadership--more specifically between 
Antoni Zabalza and Jose Enrique Serrano--only make matters 
worse. Serra too has become concerned about the government's 
lack of political visibility and has turned to making more 
frequent appearances in parliament. 
  "In this government, there is only one minister with an 
established political image: Jose Borrell, minister for public 
works and transportation. There is another one, Foreign Affairs 
Minister Javier Solana, but he maintains a low profile owing to 
his intense dedication to international policy. There is a third 
who is a politician but doesn't act like one: Minister of 
Industry Juan Manuel Eguiagaray," according to high level 
officials in the prime minister's office. 
  Political debate is also virtually absent from meetings of 
the Council of Ministers. That body cedes absolute authority to 
Felipe Gonzalez, who is never contradicted. Nonetheless, out of 
political necessity the head of government last month opened two 
debates in the lower house--one on the 27 January general 
strike, and the other on the conflict between the Constitutional 
Tribunal and the Supreme Court. 
  "The problem is not so much whether things are debated, 
which 
hardly matters. The problem is the political stature of the 
ministers, which is low. The majority of the better ministers 
are not politicians," say highly placed sources in the 
administration. Economy Minister Solbes and Defense Minister 
Julian Garcia Vargas are good examples. 
  Then there are some ministers who make frequent public 
appearances but without any political impact. Several 
independent cabinet members, including Cultural Affairs Minister 
Carmen Alborch and Commerce and Tourism Minister Javier Gomez 
Navarro, are clear examples of this type. 
  The refreshing whiff of novelty which Felipe Gonzalez sought 
when he named these independents has faded. Curiously, the woman 
who seven months ago was least known among the independents, 
Health Minister Angeles Amador, has managed her portfolio with 
remarkable effectiveness. 
  In this gray landscape, the work done by Alfredo Perez 
Rubalcaba, head of the prime minister's office, as spokesman for 
the government is insufficient, despite his efforts and growing 
influence. "His visibility, though necessary, is not sufficient 
to establish the government's political presence," say sources 
in the prime minister's office. 
  Various social strata are reacting in different ways to this 
lack of public visibility. In a recent statement on behalf of an 
association of manufacturers of equipment goods, Jose Maria 
Vizcaino, former head of the Basque employers' association, 
criticized the government's lack of leadership. In times of 
crisis, he said, people need something to hold onto, leadership 
that inspires confidence, and visibility--and government is 
falling down in this area. Another business leader, Enrique 
Kaibel, was surprised and appreciative when a politician, in 
this instance the undersecretary for public works, Antoni 
Llarden, attended a businessmen's function in Valencia. 
<H5>  Role of Luck </H5>
  The government is pinning its political hopes on success in 
ending the economic recession. The prime minister is gambling 
that within a year people will see new jobs appearing and 
realize the recession is almost behind them. 
  If this does not happen, chances of the government 
continuing 
beyond the municipal and autonomous elections in spring of 1995 
would be remote. "This is the biggest problem we face as we run 
the obstacle course that lies ahead," say sources in the 
government. 
  Meanwhile, the prime minister's advisers seem relatively 
satisfied with the work accomplished over the eight months the 
government has been in power. During this time, it has 
maintained a parliamentary majority in the face of various 
unpleasant "shocks" thanks to support from the Catalonian 
nationalists. 
  The biggest problem with the alliance policy has been one of 
image--a failure to overcome suspicions fueled by the opposition 
that the pacts with CiU [Convergence and Union] involved 
offsetting concessions and would compromise the country's 
territorial integrity. 
  Another recent government success is to have diffused, only 
two weeks after the general strike, the event's impact on public 
opinion. The strategy of nonconfrontation with the unions, 
developed by the prime minister's office, has had an effect. Its 
success is all the more impressive considering that the prime 
minister in recent months has been forced to adopt a whole 
series of "unpopular and necessary" measures such as labor 
reform and a wage freeze on government workers. 
  What with needed legislation, sectoral measures such as the 
important health package, and progress on the democratic and 
autonomous communities agendas, the government, at least in its 
own estimation, has been running in "high gear" and getting more 
done than the previous legislature.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Ana Camacho] </F>
  [Text] With every passing month, Spaniards are becoming 
more pessimistic about the future of Spain in general, but they 
are moderately optimistic about their personal situation. So 
says a study by the Bilbao Vizcaya Bank [BBV] Foundation titled 
"Tendencias sociales en Espana (1960-1990)" that was released 
yesterday in Madrid. Increased identification of Spaniards with 
their region or hometown (rather than the nation) and greater 
awareness of inequalities are two more new tendencies engendered 
by the [democratic] transition, the study says. 
  Unemployment is the country's biggest problem, according to 
58 percent of Spaniards. This is one of the conclusions of 
"Tendencias sociales en Espana," in which 34 Spanish researchers 
participated. The three volume study coordinated by sociologist 
Salustiano del Campo forms part of an international project, 
"Cartography of Social Change," which is designed to produce a 
comparative analysis of social structures of the most advanced 
countries. 
  The Spanish study emphasizes that whereas the process of 
dramatic change was effected in European societies in the 19th 
century, it did not come to Spain until the years 1960-1975. Key 
factors in its evolution have been the constant growth 
experienced by the Spanish economy since 1961--GDP increased 65 
percent between 1975 and 1991--and securities exchange 
modernizations engendered by the transition process. 
  Despite these transformations, "Spain's four horsemen of the 
apocalypse" continue to be--as they have been for the last 20 
years--unemployment, drugs, crime, and terrorism, although their 
relative importance has shifted. Terrorism, which in the early 
1980's was described by half of all Spaniards as one of the 
country's three biggest problems, is now of urgent concern to 
only one out of four Spaniards surveyed. The fading concern 
about terrorism is counterbalanced by increasing alarm about 
crime. Whereas in the early 1980's crime was considered cause 
for concern by only 15 percent of Spaniards, it was cited by 
34.4 percent of those queried in the most recent survey. The 
study also notes the growing importance of a "fifth horseman," 
economic recession. 
  "The idea that people have about these problems is that each 
time resolving them is more difficult than it was the time 
before," says the study, noting that this "high degree of 
pessimism" is of "critical importance for creating mechanisms to 
stimulate the changes Spanish society needs" to facilitate a 
solution. 
  Moreover, Spaniards are showing confidence in the future and 
"moderate optimism with respect to their personal prospects." 
This attitude, apparently contradictory to the former, is 
explained by the study as a possible "defense mechanism against 
pessimistic visions of the country's future." "Well, 
expectations now are significantly lower than they were in 
buoyant times, when general conditions were less alarming." 
  Among trends introduced by the democratic transition, the 
study highlighted an increase in feelings of belonging at the 
local level, to the detriment of identification with wider 
geographical spheres such as the national or supranational. In 
1981, 40 percent said they most strongly identified with their 
home locality, 17 percent with their region, and 34 percent with 
Spain. A decade later, only 21 percent felt their Spanish 
nationality was most important, compared to 45 percent who 
identified at the local level, and 16 percent who identified 
with their region. 
  Examining the economic factors, the study emphasized the 
existence of developmental inequalities among the autonomous 
communities. Social solidarity mechanisms and migratory 
movements have prevented these disequilibria from being 
translated into inequalities in personal income. In the 1980's 
Madrid, the Basque Country, Cantabria, and Asturias grew less 
rapidly than the rest of the communities. Madrid's regression 
was explained by the "greater tax burden or exceptional 
efficiency of tax collection."

<F P=106> ["Introductory" statement by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl </F>
on the occasion of the 20th conference with business and trade 
union representatives in Bonn on 28 February 1994: "Good Result 
of Development Work in New Laender"] 
  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Colleagues: I would like 
to welcome you to our 20th top-level meeting on the economic 
development work in the new laender. 
  Almost exactly four years ago this day, that is to say still 
before the restoration of German unity, we met for our first 
round of talks. Since then these regular meetings between 
representatives of the business community, the trade unions, and 
the federal and laender authorities have helped to analyze 
pressing problems regarding the development in eastern Germany 
and to initiate solutions. 
  The comprehensive structural changes are still fully under 
way. Out of almost 10 million jobs more than 3 million have been 
lost -- with all the hardships unemployment causes for those 
affected. 
  People have had to adapt to completely new living 
circumstances at breathtaking speed. Four decades of separation 
and such differing living conditions have left deep marks. In 
the history of a nation 40 years is a short period. Yet, for 
millions of people, this period constitutes a considerable part 
-- the best years in many cases -- of their lives. Thus, it is 
all the more important today to give the people a concrete 
perspective for their future. 
  Looking back at what we have achieved so far, we can say 
that 
on our path to completing the economic and social unity of 
Germany we have made good progress despite all the difficulties. 
We have been able to disconnect to a large degree the economic 
development in the new laender from the recession in western 
Germany. This year we expect the economy in the new laender to 
grow between 6 and 8 percent in real terms. 
  More than 600,000 businesses have been set up and thousands 
of enterprises reprivatized, which shows that the will to 
independence has developed very dynamically in the new laender. 
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to the 
entrepreneurs in the new laender. Their courage to embark on 
the course of self-employment with great resolution, 
particularly in this era of great changes, deserves our great 
respect and our strong support. 
  The Federal Government is firmly determined to continue its 
policy of massive investment promotion at a high level. Since 
unification, government promotion has led to a total of about 
190 billion German marks [DM] in private investment. 
  Rapid investment is the key to success for developing 
eastern 
Germany. Existing enterprises must be modernized and new 
competitive enterprises established. This is the really 
promising path to create lasting jobs in eastern Germany. The 
necessary economic reconstruction is supported by private 
investors to a significant degree. Investment and purchasing 
promises, which the west German economy provided within the 
framework of the solidarity pact, also have been helpful. 
  In my view it is of particular importance that in the coming 
year there will again be a sufficient number of places for 
apprentices. I do not want to elaborate on this issue today. 
Nevertheless, I hope we will all try as hard as we can in this 
connection. There will be talks with the economic associations 
and the trade unions in due course to produce another 
large-scale private training initiative. It does not make any 
sense to panic again and to call for public funds in this regard. 
  I am sure we agree that a sizable contribution by the German 
credit sector will be essential in order to achieve the 
difficult restructuring of the east German economy. I am 
starting from the assumption that the promise of an additional 
DM1 billion, provided by the credit sector within the framework 
of the solidarity pact for the privatization of those Trust 
Agency enterprises that are capable of being salvaged, continues 
to apply and will be implemented. This is also a question of 
the banks' credibility. 
  I am well aware that taking over Trust Agency enterprises 
may 
be quite difficult. Nevertheless, I would be glad if, despite 
these difficulties, the talks between the banking sector and the 
Trust Agency were to lead to positive results in the next few 
weeks. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, those who travel frequently to the new 
laender -- as I do -- and visit enterprises and factories there 
can be convinced that what is being built there are 
state-of-the-art production plants -- also by international 
standards. I am thinking, for example, of the new computer 
plant in Thuringia, of Europe's most modern automobile plant, 
new, highly efficient printing centers, or a factory for the 
construction of a new generation of aircraft engines. Every 
investor who comes to eastern Germany also takes the most 
progressive technology and latest know-how there. 
  Public as well as private investment per capita is 
meanwhile higher than in western Germany, and investment 
activities are still increasing in the new laender. For 1994, 
the Ifo economic research institute expects investment spending 
to increase by 15 percent to a level of more than DM160 billion. 
This is investment in the future of all of Germany. 
  It is the declared objective of the Federal Government to 
support as strongly as possible development of independent and 
competitive industry in eastern Germany. In the course of our 
talks, Minister Rexrodt will present an interim balance in this 
connection. 
  For the successful establishment of modern economic 
structures we also must create the bases for an efficient energy 
supply that is adequate for eastern Germany as economic center. 
One important subject in this connection is the privatization 
of the east German electricity enterprises and of brown coal 
production. 
  I would like to ask the representatives of the Trust Agency 
and the electricity producers to discuss this issue in the 
course of our meeting. In this connection I would like to 
welcome most warmly the representatives of the U.S.-British 
group that bought Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle AG. 
  We expect that the billions that will be invested in the 
energy sector will also provide an essential contribution to the 
upswing in eastern Germany. Enterprises in the new laender 
should benefit from the orders for this investment to as large a 
degree as possible. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, we are one country. Germany will only 
prosper when we all prosper. Hence, overcoming the recession in 
the western laender is also of the utmost importance for the 
continuation of the upswing in the new laender. 
  There are many signs that indicate that the economic 
recession is bottoming out and that recovery is gradually 
starting. The recession, has, however also laid bare structural 
problems whose elimination must no longer be put off. Necessary 
reforms have been neglected for decades. This applies to such 
important issues as railroad and postal reform, which we have 
now set in motion. 
  These structural problems in the west are problems of the 
old 
FRG. They have nothing to do with German unity. On the 
contrary, the profound structural changes in the new laender 
are, at the same time, also increasing the chances for renewal 
in western Germany. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, one result of the recession and 
structural problems was that more than 4 million people in 
Germany have so far lost their jobs. This is depressing for me 
and for all of us. Nobody must remain indifferent when people 
become unemployed. Our most important joint duty is to secure 
employment and to create jobs. 
  What we need now more than ever is the readiness to change 
our way of thinking and to act. The political, business, and 
trade union communities all have the obligation to meet their 
responsibilities and to help secure employment and create new 
jobs. 
  With its report on securing the future of Germany as an 
economic center, the Federal Government last September presented 
a clear action program for more growth and employment. The 
public reaction to the report has been more than encouraging. 
  The Federal Government with great energy and swiftness began 
to implement measures to improve Germany as an economic center 
that were contained in the report. In addition, in January, we 
agreed on an action program for more growth and employment. 
These measures are also being implemented. 
  With these steps, once more, we are increasing the pace to 
secure the future of Germany as an economic center. These are 
important decisions needed to set the course for creating 
several hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the short and 
medium terms. In six months, more than two-thirds of the almost 
90 measures that the Federal Government still envisaged for this 
legislative term have been implemented or successfully launched. 
  The Federal Government is firmly determined to advance the 
implementation of further difficult measures even during the 
election campaign period. This will force us to make further 
efforts. I know that more and more people understand that these 
measures are indispensable. I would like to invite all of you 
to embark on this course together and act accordingly!

<F P=106> ["fy/Sto."-signed report: "A Lack of Money, Injustices, and </F>
Self-Doubt Cause Concern in the Bundeswehr"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 8 March -- The Bundeswehr is in a bad state. 
That is what emerges from the report for 1993 that Bundestag 
Defense Commissioner [Alfred] Biehle presented to the public in 
Bonn on Tuesday [8 March]. Financial cutbacks in particular, 
but also questions that are still unanswered about which tasks 
the Bundeswehr could assume within the framework of the UN, as 
well as administrative obstacles and injustices in the course of 
the unification process, have imposed a burden on the inner 
cohesion of the Bundeswehr. "The motivation of many soldiers 
has been impaired," states Biehle's report. Biehle is full of 
praise for the Bundeswehr troops who were deployed in Somali and 
Cambodia. Their selection and training proved their worth. 
Their ability merits recognition and extensive praise. 
  Biehle criticized the political leadership. He complained 
that after unification the Bundeswehr received three great 
tasks, but no political direction on how they were to be 
fulfilled. In particular, there was a lack of clarity about the 
availability of financial resources. These tasks were to reduce 
the size of the Bundeswehr to 370,000, to develop the armed 
forces in the new laender, and to restructure with a view to 
performing additional tasks. In view of the lack of consensus 
about the deployment of troops abroad, many soldiers feel that 
parliament, the government, and society are unable to provide 
certainty about the Bundeswehr's future tasks. Biehle said many 
soldiers found it difficult to trust politicians and their 
superiors. 
  There was also criticism of the leadership of the Defense 
Ministry. Leadership also means that one can rely on decisions 
that have been made. Short-term changes in stationing decisions 
that were described as "binding" have caused uncertainty among 
troops. Only 20 percent of the married long-term and 
professional servicemen that are being transferred would move to 
new locations with their families, whereas 10 years ago the 
number was three times higher. The difficult housing situation 
is also a reason for this. That is why provision of housing 
must be considered a "top priority," said Biehle: "A family 
that is intact is an important source of strength for the 
soldier in his daily life." 
  The report also points out that compulsory military service 
enjoys little support among the young men affected by it. About 
30 percent of the young men in each conscription year receive 
exemptions, and a further 30 percent opt to perform civilian 
duties instead. The remainder just about satisfy the 
Bundeswehr's need for conscripts. In the perception of society 
and those eligible for military service, the importance of 
military service and alternative national service as something 
enshrined in the constitution is continually declining. 
  People view the relationship between the two forms of 
service 
as a rule-and-exception issue. This is because 95 percent of 
applications for exemption from military service are granted. 
Whoever pursues the matter with determination does not have to 
do his military service. Today, there are 150,000 conscripts 
doing their basic service compared to 131,000 doing alternative 
national service. Biehle called for "boosting" the 
attractiveness of military service "so that military service can 
be maintained at all." 
  As part of the austerity measures, those doing military 
service have seen a 14-percent reduction in entitlements, which 
means that their entitlements have been reduced more than those 
of any other social group. Biehle said it was "unbearable and 
intolerable" that soldiers who had previously served in the NVA 
[GDR's National People's Army] and were by chance promoted while 
training in western Germany received their full salaries while 
their comrades in the east received only 80 percent. The return 
of these soldiers to the east created a socially explosive 
situation. 
  Biehle's report described relations between the main 
branches of the armed forces as "extremely critical." With the 
exception of units that are intended for deployment abroad, the 
Bundeswehr's personnel and material situation deteriorated 
significantly in 1993. Biehle stated that supplies of fuel and 
ammunition were insufficient to train troops properly. Some 
forms of firing range training such as "fire for effect" had to 
be abandoned altogether because of a lack of ammunition. 
Training at night had to be stopped after a short period of 
time, because of a lack of lighting. According to information 
from the officers and noncommissioned officers responsible for 
training, at the present time, there is only half the 
large-calibre ammunition needed to achieve prescribed training 
objectives. Even the training of infantry in the use of 
handguns was, in some cases, impossible because of a shortage of 
ammunition for maneuvers. Marksmen have had to indicate they 
have fired by saying "bang!" Because of a shortage of 
ammunition, trainers often had to use the words "bang!" or 
"detonation!" to indicate that a fuse had been ignited. Both 
trainers and those being trained found this ridiculous, states 
the commissioner's report. Complex battlefield maneuvers could 
not be practiced often enough, because of fuel economies and the 
need to save materiel. To prolong the life of equipment, all 
Bundeswehr units that do not belong to the crisis reaction 
forces intended for deployment abroad had to mothball half their 
equipment. In the case of the remaining equipment, shortcomings 
in maintenance increased significantly with shortages of spare 
parts becoming apparent. Biehle reports that some units had to 
wait three months for tank brake linings and some units had to 
wait 22 months for maintenance work to be carried out on armored 
reconnaisance vehicles. The Air Force has also experienced such 
deficiencies. "To preserve the state of aircraft," pilots' 
flight training hours have been reduced. Units stationed in 
eastern Germany have complained about receiving large items of 
equipment from the old laender that cannot be used or are in a 
bad state. The situation is compounded by the fact that 
soldiers responsible for maintenance have been inadequately 
trained. In addition, the periods of time spent on firing 
ranges by units that are not expected to be used for missions 
abroad have been reduced drastically. There is even a shortage 
of office equipment. Trainers have to pay for such equipment out 
of their own pockets in order to be able to teach. Finally, the 
effectiveness of training has been diminished because of the use 
of officers from Bundeswehr universities who have been 
inadequately prepared for teaching troops and are insufficiently 
motivated. Occasionally, one gets the impression they do not 
identify with their occupation. The declining physical 
condition of young people also has had a negative effect on 
training. "The discrepancy between assignments and available 
resources has prompted a feeling of resignation among many 
officers. Trainers rightly fear they will have to accept a loss 
of authority."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Argentine Economics Minister </F>
Domingo Cavallo by "bag": "Buenos Aires Is Waiting for Hermes 
Relief"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Until now, German investors "have shown 
only a mild interest in our country," Argentina's Economics 
Minister Domingo Cavallo said. The Spanish, Italians, and 
British, on the other hand, have realized that the changes going 
on in the South American country are promising. 
  In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, Cavallo said that during 
his visit to Germany, which ends on Thursday [10 March], he 
discussed more favorable conditions for Hermes export guarantees 
with Economics Minister Rexrodt and Finance Minister Waigel. 
Currently, involvement in Argentina is considered "especially 
risky," similar to involvement in Brazil, for instance. Hermes 
credit guarantees are accordingly expensive. A double taxation 
agreement with Germany is being worked out. 
  Cavallo is optimistic that the German side will be persuaded 
by developments in Argentina: The national budget has been in 
surplus since 1992. By linking the peso to the dollar, 
inflation could be cut from 5,000 percent (in 1989) to 4-5 
percent this year. Over the last three years, annual economic 
growth has been 6 to 9 percent. 
  The Menem government has so far privatized over 100 
companies. Among European countries, Spain is particularly 
active in the telecommunications sector. France (water, gas, 
electricity), Italy (telecommunications as well), and Great 
Britain (gas, petroleum) have made substantial investments. 
Mentioning Germany, Cavallo could only think of a satellite 
project by Dasa. 
  There will be further privatization of airports, nuclear 
power stations, and the electricity and water supply outside 
Buenos Aires. Cavallo hopes that German interest will be greater 
this time than it has been in the past. 
  He sees good opportunities for German companies in the 
traditionally private sectors. In the car industry (Mercedes 
and Volkswagen) the economics minister hopes for higher 
production with a simultaneous reduction in the number of 
models, in order to increase productivity. Other models and 
parts could be increasingly imported from Germany -- not least 
because of the significant cut in customs duties. 
  Involvement in the food sector is also worthwhile, according 
to the economics minister. Thus, a German brewery has become 
active in Argentina. Apart from that, Cavallo mentioned 
catering, tourism, and the pharmaceutical industry. 
  MERCOSUR, whose members are Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and 
Paraguay, offers a large domestic market for investors. On 1 
January 1995, a free trade area will be completed. Argentina's 
interest in NAFTA does not contradict this. The foreign and 
economics ministers of MERCOSUR will meet in Buenos Aires on 
Thursday [10 March] to discuss the likely effects of a planned 
customs union, Cavallo said. 
  Argentina, whose main exports are wheat, soya, meat, and 
recently also fish, had expected the GATT Uruguay Round to 
result in more liberal trade in agricultural produce, but it is 
nevertheless content with the outcome. Traditional exports are 
declining, while industrial exports are on the increase. 
  Cavallo does not consider the negative balance of trade 
(1993: minus $3.2 billion) to be a problem. Like Germany in the 
1950's, Argentina is financing its economic reconstruction with 
foreign capital. Over the past three years, some $30 billion 
has come into the country, some two-thirds of which is 
expatriate capital. The country will depend on these capital 
imports for another three to four years. What is important is 
that the 1991/92 boom in consumption is over and money is now 
"going into productive investment," Cavallo said.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ps": "Number of Unemployed at New Record </F>
High"] 
  [Text] Unemployment in the Federal Republic showed another 
slight increase in February. At the end of last month, 
4,042,427 people were out of work throughout Germany. The 
president of the Federal Employment Office in Nuremberg, 
Bernhard Jagoda, spoke of a continuing "unfavorable economic 
tendency" in the west of the Federal Republic. In the new 
laender, the development is "more favorable all in all." The 
slight increase in unemployment of some 13,000 in January is 
divided almost equally between western and eastern Germany. In 
the past, February usually saw the first stimulation in the 
labor market. 
  Unemployment has risen by a tenth of 1 percent to 8.9 
percent 
in the old laender and 17.1 percent in the new laender. 
Although this is the first time that comprehensive data on the 
structure of employment in the new laender are available, Jagoda 
does not want to publish any all-German statistics in 1994. He 
admits that unemployment in western and eastern Germany together 
is currently in the double digits. Publishing a total figure 
would underplay the situation in the new laender, Jagoda said. 
On the other hand, the all-German figure would make Germany 
fall back in the European list, where the west German figure is 
usually taken into account. According to Friedrich Buttler, the 
head of the Institute for Labor Market and Job Research 
affiliated to the Employment Office, this would mean an 
intolerable distortion owing to different structures in western 
and eastern Germany. 
  The labor market in the west is still characterized by job 
cuts, which became even worse during the winter months. 
According to the preliminary figures of the Federal Statistical 
Office, there were 28.43 million people gainfully employed in 
January. This is 640,000 fewer than a year ago. The amount of 
short-time work has, however, gone down by 50 percent to 518,700 
in a year. But, in February, it went up again for the first 
time. 
  Jagoda does not consider the fact that the labor exchange 
offices were reporting more vacancies last month as an 
indication that the economy is recovering. The demand is 
restricted exclusively to agriculture and catering. The reports 
were obviously aiming at employing foreigners. Owing to the new 
regulations, employers have to indicate their requirements for 
seasonal workers early because jobs must first be held for 
German workers for a certain period of time. 
  Jagoda thinks that the downward trend in employment in the 
new laender is over. Except for seasonal fluctuations, the 
tendency toward stability is continuing there. This statement 
is based on the decreasing relief by labor market measures such 
as prepension, training, or short-time work. What has increased 
is job-creating measures. 
  Nuremberg now has detailed data on the employment situation 
in eastern Germany; they are, however, valid for the key date of 
31 June 1993. According to these figures, there were only 5.6 
million people liable to pay social insurance contributions. 
Before the collapse of the GDR, some 9 million people had jobs. 
The decline in employment since summer 1992 is reported as 
322,000. Workers in the small trades and women have been 
especially severely hit by job losses. The extent of the 
reduction in the industrial basis becomes obvious from the 
figure of a mere 1.1 million people employed in the processing 
sector. This is a much lower percentage than in the old laender. 
The only expansion taking place in the east was in the 
construction industry, which had 700,000 people employed in June 
1993.

<F P=106> [Report signed "uhl": "BDI: Business Location Far From </F>
Secured"] 
  [Text] According to Tyll Necker, president of the 
Federation of German Industries (BDI), efforts to improve 
business location in Germany have shown a substantial increase 
lately, but "the number still has to be increased considerably." 
  The "massive trend" to transfer production to cheaper 
locations continues in German industry. At the same time, 
foreign companies have only a limited interest in investing in 
Germany. Due to high labor costs, Germany has lost 10 percent 
in world markets over the past few years. Necker welcomed the 
fact that the costs of the latest wage round in the metal 
industry are "practically zero." What is worrying, however, is 
that it was not possible to increase working hours. 
  Necker said that "an incredible amount of legal work 
disappears in the shadow economy." Therefore, the deductions 
from wages that are far too high, with taxes and social 
contributions currently amounting to 46 percent of the gross 
wages, must be reduced together with the surcharge on companies' 
labor costs. This is the only way to reduce the "wedge" between 
legal and illicit work and to increase the opportunities for 
legal work that exist in many fields. 
  Necker cautioned against considering his meeting with Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] politicians as spectacular. 
"We have not switched to the other camp"; industry has always 
been open-minded and has always discussed technical problems 
with all democratic forces. Thus, Kohl, Rexrodt, and Scharping 
will be speaking at the BDI annual conference on 31 May. In 
fact, the SPD is still thinking "too much in terms of 
redistribution." It is not a matter of adding a burden here and 
reducing one there, but significant cuts must be made in the 
public sector. The public share must be reduced to the 45.6 
percent it was before reunification. 
  Necker expects the economy to show an "upward trend without 
momentum" in the course of this year. Orders, particularly from 
overseas, are increasing considerably. Engineering is one 
sector where the export situation has clearly improved, while 
domestic demand has further declined from a basis that was low 
anyhow. 
  In the new laender, there are "clear positive developments 
in 
certain fields." These include the construction industry and 
related sectors, in particular. The development of east German 
industry producing for local markets is "basically positive." 
Meanwhile, there are the first positive signs in the 
"transfrontier sector." The situation is, however, critical in 
the chemical industry and in large parts of the electrical and 
engineering industries.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- According to Germany's Federal 
Intelligence Service (BND) the Russian mafia has no access to 
former Soviet nuclear plants or weapons-grade nuclear material. 
BND director Konrad Porzner told (the Thursday edition of) the 
HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that there was no indication 
that countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons had had any 
success in recruiting Russian nuclear weapons experts. 
  "Nuclear smuggling from the former Soviet Union is not as 
widespread as portrayed in the media. As far as we are aware 
there is no material available for nuclear weapons construction, 
either in terms of type or volume, on the black market," Porzner 
stressed during the interview. "It can be said with more or less 
certainty that the atomic arsenal is under the control of the 
armed forces. We have no knowledge that the Russian mafia has 
any influence on nuclear facilities." 
  Nuclear weapons were still sought after by other countries, 
Porzner said, and cited North Korea by way of example. However, 
Iran "is clearly striving for nuclear weapons" as well. Iran 
was already capable of manufacturing chemical weapons, he said. 
The German Government stopped nuclear cooperation with Iran 
years ago. 
  According to security service information, there is still a 
threat to the states from worldwide organized crime. "The threat 
has been recognized but not banished," said Porzner. The 3,000 
or so gangs in the Russian mafia had no access to nuclear 
material, "but there is no doubt that their influence reaches 
into administrative structures and authorities." [passage

<F P=106> ["afk"-signed report: "Right-Wing Extremists Move Closer </F>
Together in Saxony"] 
  [Text] Dresden, 8 March -- In Saxony, there is evidence of 
links between the neo-Nazi scene and the Republikaner, as well 
as between the German People's Union (DVU) and the National 
Democratic Party (NPD). That is what Saxony Interior Minister 
Eggert, Christian Democratic Union, said in Dresden on Tuesday 
[8 March] when he presented the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution report for 1993. According to the report, 
functionaries and members of the National Offensive and German 
Alternative in the meantime have become members of the DVU and 
the NPD. The former functionaries of extreme right-wing parties 
also have established links with new circles. An employee of 
the Office for the Protection of the Constitution reported on a 
meeting in Dresden attended by NPD members and neo-Nazis after 
which Republikaner leaflets were distributed. 
  The number of criminal offenses of an extremist right-wing 
nature fell by 60 percent compared to 1992, said Eggert. A 
total of 84 crimes of violence and 389 other offenses, mainly 
the painting of swastikas, were registered. They were usually 
"spontaneous actions," mainly involving skinheads who were not 
members of extremist right-wing organizations. As Eggert said, 
there are 3,400 right-wing extremists in Saxony, of whom 900 are 
considered militant. Approximately 300 people belong to 
neo-Nazi organizations. 
  The Office for the Protection of the Constitution noted that 
among the Republikaner, who have 700 members in Saxony, there 
are "indications of efforts directed against the basic liberal 
democratic order." Leaflets show "that the political ideas of 
the party in Saxony are based not on a democratic but on a 
nationalist ideology." The DVU is reported to have 1,500 
members in Saxony, but is "still not very active" as far as 
public events are concerned. The NPD has approximately 250 
members. The organizational development of these parties has 
still not been completed, but one can expect them to participate 
in this year's elections, said Eggert. 
  Last year, 57 crimes of violence were committed by left-wing 
extremists. The militant left-wing extremist "scene" in Saxony 
consists of about 500 people. Compared to extremist left-wing 
circles in western Germany, the "scene" has developed ideas of 
its own. There is little support for "internationalism" or 
imprisoned members of the Red Army Faction. Extremist positions 
are held on such issues as unemployment, "west German 
colonization of the east," and coming to terms with the Stasi 
past. 
  The DKP [German Communist Party] and the KPD [Communist 
Party 
of Germany] have not been able to develop any organizations in 
Saxony so far. On the other hand, the extremist left-wing 
Communist Platform (KPF) is trying to increase its influence 
within the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. Eggert does not 
believe that the activities of the KPF faction within the PDS 
justify having the entire party monitored by the Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution.

<F P=106> [Report signed "kat./les": "New Dimension of Violence"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Magdeburg/Dresden -- Extremism in the new 
laender is increasing. The Land Office for the Protection of 
the Constitution said that the potential for extreme-right 
violence is "alarmingly high" in Saxony-Anhalt. Last year, there 
were 328 violent acts with an extreme-right connection, Interior 
Minister Walter Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) said when 
he presented the 1993 report of the Office for the Protection of 
the Constitution in Magdeburg. The centers of extreme-right 
activity are above all the big cities of Halle and Magdeburg. 
  According to the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, the violent confrontations between right-wing and 
left-wing extremists have assumed a new dimension. The 
threshold for brutal violence has been lowered on both sides. 
With 70 violent acts against leftists motivated by right-wing 
extremism in 1993, the number of these offenses has doubled. 
[passage omitted] 
  Right-wing extremism did not come to the old FRG from the 
former GDR only after unification. With this opinion, Saxony 
Interior Minister Heinz Eggert (CDU) contradicted statements to 
this effect made by Federal Prosecutor General Nehm. It is true 
that the propensity for violence has increased significantly in 
the east, "but this is connected with the police's inability to 
act at this stage," Eggert told DIE WELT. Criminal offenses by 
the extreme-left (57) in the Free State of Saxony remained 
constant compared with 1992.

  [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- France plans a rapid boost 
to its forces in Sarajevo by redeploying a battalion of 800 men 
in the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Richard Duque said here Wednesday [9 March]. 
  The move was being made as a matter of urgency to help 
implement a Security Council resolution on restoring essential 
public services in the Bosnian capital, he said. 
  France has more than 6,000 troops in former Yugoslavia, 
forming the largest UNPROFOR contingent. Half are in Bosnia, 
including 2,400 at Sarajevo. 
  The redeployment to strengthen the French units in and 
around 
Sarajevo was also announced by government spokesman Nicolas 
Sarkozy after the weekly cabinet meeting. 
  He made the point that it was not a question of increasing 
France's UNPROFOR strength but of carrying out a redeployment. 
  French troops in Sarajevo meanwhile cleared away the last of 
the landmines and other defences dug in in 22 months of war at 
the Brotherhood and Unity bridge linking the Serb district of 
Grbavica to the rest of the city. 
  The French moved in a month ago when the current ceasefire 
took effect. The bridge still remains out of bounds to 
civilians however, in the absence of a political agreement 
between Bosnians and Serbs on restoring normal traffic.

Measures To Protect Palestinians"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels -- French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
has stressed his country's backing for the dispatch of "civilian 
observers" to the occupied territories. In a statement to 
AL-HAYAH he demanded that "firm, strong, and clear measures" be 
taken to protect Palestinians. [passage omitted] 
  Alain Juppe stressed the need to continue and speed up the 
peace process "in order to restore the credibility of the 
negotiations." In his view, this aim requires that "security be 
guaranteed in the occupied territories. It is the 
responsibility of the occupation authorities now. This 
responsibility will be assumed by the Palestinian authority 
after the Israeli withdrawal" in accordance with the agreement 
between the Israeli Government and the PLO. France is urging 
European Union countries to "take firm, strong, and clear 
measures, and -- to that end -- supports an international 
civilian presence in the occupied territories." 
  According to the French foreign minister, the second 
condition for restoring credibility to the peace negotiations is 
to speed up the implementation of the international aid program 
in order to improve living conditions for the Palestinians, "as 
this aid is still in the coffers of international 
organizations." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "A.V.": "Conclusion of Uruguay Round Will </F>
Have Slightly Favorable Impact on French Industry"] 
  [Text] The conclusion of the Uruguay Round on 15 December 
1993 within the framework of GATT will have a positive impact on 
French industry. This impact will, however, be minor: Our 
exports of manufactured products will increase by 1.15 percent 
and our imports by 0.34 percent, according to a study published 
on Monday, 7 March by the Ministry of Industry, Postal Services, 
Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade. 
  The study was carried out by BIPE [Office for Economic 
Information and Forecasts] on behalf of the government. BIPE 
estimates that average customs duties affecting exported 
industrial products will drop from 4.6 percent -- the level they 
were at before the agreement -- to 3.2 percent when the 
agreement enters into force, i.e., within a maximum period of 10 
years. It is because industrial customs duties were already so 
low that these products were not the focal point of the Uruguay 
Round negotiations, unlike agricultural products, textile 
products, services, and intellectual property issues. This also 
explains the fact that, generally speaking, the impact of the 
anticipated drop in customs duties (30 percent) on exports and 
imports of manufactured products will not very large. 
  The study shows that the impact is unequal in different 
sectors. For exports by French industry, it is obviously the 
most highly taxed products which benefit from the greatest 
effects of the planned drop: leather, shoes, clothing, 
textiles, professional electrical equipment, followed by 
mechanical engineering, and -- lastly -- parachemicals, 
pharmaceuticals, printing, and publishing. On the other hand, 
products from the aeronautics and shipbuilding sectors, as well 
as the nonferrous metals, paper and cardboard, wood, and 
furniture sectors will not benefit as much from the Uruguay 
Round agreement. 
<H5>  Minor Impact on the Economy </H5>
  For imports, average customs duties will drop from the 
current 1.1 percent to 0.8 percent. Sectors which will see 
imports rise most will be leather, shoes, textiles, clothing, 
professional electrical equipment, and household equipment. 
Steel-making, aeronautics, shipbuilding, glass, and 
construction materials will scarcely be affected. 
  All in all, the positive impact of the GATT agreement will 
be 
stronger on exports than on imports, and will therefore favor 
French industry. This can be explained by France's lower level 
of taxation compared to other countries -- primarily, of course, 
developing countries. 
  The impact on the economy will only amount to 0.2 percent of 
overall production within the next 10 years -- a very modest 
impact indeed. However, the study stresses that a failure in 
the Uruguay Round would have certainly had a negative impact on 
world economic growth. Sixteen thousand jobs will be created 
(up 0.1 percent for the trading sector), more than half of which 
will be in industry: 3,000 in the manufacture of professional 
electrical equipment; 1,700 in mechanical engineering; 1,400 in 
foundries; and 900 in parachemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, 
and clothing.

  [Text] Congolese President Pascal Lissouba's visit in 
France is continuing. He was received by Francois Mitterrand 
this morning. When he left the Elysee Palace, Pascal Lissouba 
said that he had echoed Africa's cry of despair after the 
devaluation of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc. 
Africa deserves better than this, he said. He added that Paris 
has to tackle problems differently, including the debt issue. 
The visit of the Congolese president seems to reflect a 
rapprochement between Paris and Brazzaville. Monique Mas 
reports: 
  [Mas] Indeed, relations between France and Congo seem to 
have 
improved after a period of severe tension. There were problems, 
one has tried to deflate them in order to go on, Pascal Lissouba 
said. He met his French counterpart earlier today. 
  A series of official meetings is on the agenda of his 
private 
visit. President Lissouba will also meet the French minister 
for foreign affairs, the minister of cooperation, and the 
interior minister. There will be more talk about developments 
in the Congolese political situation after international 
arbitration on the electoral dispute and after violence has 
subsided. In that respect, Paris believes that there has been 
some progress, but that more is needed; for instance, details on 
the concrete form the national reconciliation at a political 
level announced in Brazzaville might take. As for economic 
matters, Paris has referred Congo to the IMF. It has been badly 
hit by the devaluation of the CFA franc. There will also be 
some talk about the timeliness of the return of French 
cooperation workers. The oil issue has no longer been a bone of 
contention since President Lissouba backed down in favor of 
French interests. As for the rest, Paris remains cautious.

  [Text] The president of the Congolese Republic is 
continuing his high-level political talks in Paris. Pascal 
Lissouba went to see Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Yesterday 
he was received by President Mitterrand. He also had talks with 
Michel Roussin, the minister of cooperation. To sum up for us 
so far on Pascal Lissouba's visit to Paris, here is Monique Mas: 
  [Mas] Pascal Lissouba has decided to turn the page on the 
Franco-Congolese quarrel. He hopes that French severity was 
perhaps the expression of the fact that it had entertained too 
high hopes of him, and the Congolese president is stressing that 
he has already taken a first step by settling the oil dispute to 
the benefit of French interests and to the detriment of the 
American Oxy oil company. He also denies having tried to play 
on Franco-American rivalries. In Lissouba's view, the Cold War 
is over anyway, and no one is interested in Africa any more. 
  Nevertheless, Congo greatly misses its oil revenue. With a 
70 percent debt to France [as heard], Lissouba's predecessor had 
obtained advances from the French oil company Elf, and Congolese 
oil is mortgaged until about 2010. The coffers are empty, but 
President Lissouba has no choice but to rise to the challenge 
both economically and as far as domestic politics are concerned. 
Having got his fingers burned by his first experiment with a 
government with 60 percent of the ministers coming from the 
opposition, he is now counting on decentralization to ensure 
civil peace. 
  [Announcer] Congolese students in Paris invaded the premises 
of their embassy this morning to protest at the nonpayment of 
their scholarships for 16 months.

<F P=106> [Sophie Huet report: "Joint RPR-UDF Platform"] </F>
  [Text] The RPR [Rally for the Republic] and UDF [Union for 
French Democracy] delegations which met again briefly yesterday 
afternoon at RPR headquarters in rue de Lille, in the presence 
of Jacques Chirac and Valery Giscard d'Estaing, put the 
finishing touches to the negotiations on the drafting of a joint 
majority "European plan." As expected, during this final 
meeting the two parties' delegations agreed on a document of 
around 20 pages which will be published today after the meeting 
of the UDF political office followed by an extraordinary meeting 
of the RPR political office. 
  "We have reached agreement on a document which will 
constitute the joint UDF-RPR platform in the European 
elections," RPR Secretary General Alain Juppe said, expressing 
the view that this is an "extremely positive step." Stressing 
the significance of this "responsible approach," UDF Secretary 
General Francois Bayrou added: "We have chosen not to compete 
with each other on the European plan" and to find an agreement 
on "the slight differences between our two parties." This 
document, which is "pragmatic" according to Pierre Lellouche 
(RPR) and which deals with many subjects (the expansion of the 
Community, the institutions, the Economic and Monetary Union, 
unemployment, defense), advocates "a Europe which is stronger in 
its political decisions," UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre Raffarin 
explained. Only by reading the document will we know what 
concessions each party has made with a view to this agreement, 
whose significance is primarily political. At all events, the 
pleased expressions on the faces of the various negotiators 
prove that everybody is satisfied by it. 
  Alain Juppe stressed that all the right conditions had now 
been established for "the joint RPR-UDF list to be drawn up." 
"We have the same concept of Europe," the RPR secretary general 
said, and "we have pledged to sit in the same group in the 
European Parliament." That leaves the question of who will head 
the list, which has still not been decided, although 
Jean-Francois Deniau, currently the big favorite, was at rue de 
Lille yesterday, as was Dominique Baudis, another standard 
bearer of the European cause.

<F P=106> [Interview with Republican Party Secretary General Philippe </F>
Vasseur by Sophie Huet; place and date not given: "Presidential 
Election: Debate Poisons Political Life"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Huet] There is no question 
now that the presidential precampaign has begun. Since the 
issue was raised by your own party, are you favorable to the 
notion of the UDF [Union for the French Democracy] having its 
own presidential candidate, or would you rather have a single 
candidate for the majority? 
  [Vasseur] I think we have been fostering a loathsome 
political climate. Let us be cautious: The Left has not lost 
the presidential election yet! This is worth a warning, or even 
a shout of alarm. The government's authority is being slowly 
undermined. And I believe that although people have every right 
to discuss what is being done, they have no right to denigrate. 
All those who have been almost systematically denigrating the 
government are picking the wrong fight. Because if the 
government falls, so will the majority. 
  As for the presidential election, I believe that it is 
unwise 
to publicly air personal squabbles, and that we all bear some 
responsibility for it. In other words, this is a debate that 
poisons our political life. We should not be obsessed by the 
presidential election. Thinking about it and preparing it is 
fine; thinking about it constantly, but not speaking of it at 
all. Indeed, what is wrong is bringing the general public into 
our quarrels. Let us wait until the vote on the budgetary bill, 
that is, until late autumn, before we tackle the problem head 
on. Right now, I am opposed to any antagonistic debate on the 
matter. I would add that attempting to capitalize on the prime 
minister's declining ratings is indicative of excessive haste. 
  [Huet] When some people call for the UDF fielding its own 
presidential candidate, do you think this is meant to increase 
pressure? 
  [Vasseur] In a way, yes. Dealing with the issue in such a 
way inevitably causes pressures. There is a definite lack of 
calm 
  [Huet] Are you favorable to a single candidate of the 
majority for the presidential election? 
  [Vasseur] I believe one should be able to mention the 
possibility without anyone feeling threatened. The single 
candidacy is certainly problematic because what we currently 
have is a diverse, many-faceted majority. There is not one 
person that embodies the whole of this majority. The very fact 
that we have been considering "primaries" demonstrates there is 
diversity. The only answer to this is to pursue the logic of 
union. And I ask two questions: First, is everyone ready to 
play the game when it comes to primaries, or any other procedure 
meant to select a presidential candidate; and, second, are we 
ready to unite behind whatever single candidate whom would thus 
be chosen? I for one am ready for this. But we need to look at 
it from a strategic viewpoint. 
  [Huet] Is it not true that the notion of a single candidate 
inevitably leads to that of establishing a single organization 
of the majority after the 1995 election? 
  [Vasseur] This would indeed be in line with the choice of a 
single majority candidate. I am a passionate advocate of both 
union and the preservation of the identity of political parties 
and -- as far as the UDF is concerned -- their various 
components. The two notions are not incompatible. However, 
should we choose to establish a single organization, it would 
have to be a confederation. If we were to high-handedly kill 
our various parties, membership would suffer. Being in the same 
political family would cause tensions and centrifugal risks, as 
some people would have one foot inside the organization and the 
other outside. The best way to unite people is not to forcibly 
herd them into the same pen. The purpose of the Republican 
Party is rather to be the fulcrum on which a single movement 
might be established, with every component being given equal 
regard. But the issue of a potential "presidential party" will 
definitely arise after the election. 
  [Huet] What do you think of holding "primary elections," 
an idea raised once again by Interior Minister Charles Pasqua in 
this paper? 
  [Vasseur] I always thought it an excellent idea in theory. 
Now, we are told that we need to legislate. But is this not a 
little late in the day? Will this not exacerbate passions 
further, revive tensions? Furthermore, such a system creates an 
extra first round, since the first round of the presidential 
election already is a kind of primary. This would usher in 
another kind of logic. If we want to continue down this road, 
we also need to confront the issue of the first round in 
parliamentary elections. Because in a way, the notion of 
"primaries" calls into question the principle of selecting the 
president of the Republic in a two-round election. 
  Also, if the bill goes through in the spring session -- and 
go through it will -- and if we hold primaries in January 1995, 
the campaign will take place right in the middle of the 
budgetary session. That will hardly make for a healthier 
political climate! 
  To sum things up, I think this is an excellent idea because 
primaries are a way to avoid a dogfight between majority leaders 
-- but there are both benefits and drawbacks to the exercise. I 
do not mind going through with it, but I do have a few qualms, 
as some potential candidates may be tempted not to play by the 
rules, arguing that the spirit of the Constitution calls for a 
vote from the whole population. Therefore there may be a 
"boomerang" effect. Once the bill has been voted, the political 
game will not be any calmer, and this will inevitably extend the 
electoral campaign. 
  [Huet] What if primaries should prove impossible to 
organize? 
  [Vasseur] If we do not succeed, we will have no choice but 
to have two candidates. There is an obvious risk that the two 
presidential candidates may be at each other's throat before the 
first round of voting. The other risk is that once elected, a 
candidate might hoard all the "spoils," that is, appropriate 
every single position to be filled, allocate himself all the 
seats up for election. To avoid this, it is essential that the 
two men enter into a veritable "contract" before the 
presidential election. Such a contract would include a 
"minimum-service" clause, a code for good electoral behavior, so 
that the two men are unable to attack each other overtly, to 
criticize each other's policies, and so as to ensure that the 
rule of reciprocal withdrawal works properly. The way I see it, 
such a contract must go even further: It must delineate the way 
the potential president of the Republic intends to govern the 
country and with which men. I would also like this contract to 
be made public before the first round.

  [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- Nearly 60 percent of the

  But the monthly poll, carried out by the BVA Institute for 
the weekly PARIS-MATCH, also said that 57 percent thought 
Balladur had the "qualities of a head of state" while 51 percent 
considered he was "thinking too much about the presidential 
election," due in May next year. 
  Questioned about the premier's calm, conciliatory style, 58 
percent said they thought Balladur "tends to try to put the 
French to sleep" and 56 percent believed he did not go far 
enough with his reforms. 
  Fifty-three percent of those polled also believed that 
Balladur was too ready to "appoint his friends to top jobs in 
major enterprises." 
  The poll showed a two-point drop in 64-year-old Balladur's 
overall popularity to 53 percent, but paradoxically, 63 percent 
were dissatisfied with the way France is being governed, the 
same figure as a month ago. 
  In another poll released Tuesday, Balladur dipped below 50 
percent support in a popularity poll for the first time since he 
came to power nearly a year ago. 
  A Gallup poll in the weekly EXPRESS said 47 percent of the 
French approved Balladur's policies, a drop of five points from 
a month ago. 
  Other polls since the beginning of February have shown falls 
of nine or 10 points in his popularity. 
  Balladur and the leader of his own Rally for the Republic 
(RPR) party, Jacques Chirac, are rivals to replace President 
Francois Mitterrand when he steps down in May 1995.

  [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- France should continue 
easing interest rates to underpin a projected modest recovery 
this year and a brisker upswing in 1995, and would do well in 
trying to reduce Germany's influence on its monetary policy, the 
OECD suggested Wednesday [9 March]. 
  In a survey of the French economy, the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said output growth 
should now resume after last year's recession which cut GDP by 
an estimated 0.8 percent and boosted France's jobless rate to a 
record 12 percent. 
  It projected growth at a modest pace of 1.1 percent this 
year, with domestic demand remaining weak and price and wage 
inflation on a steady downward path as a result of both high 
unused capacity and high unemployment. 
  Stronger domestic demand in 1995, including a recovery in 
business investment, would help raise the rate to about 2.5 
percent, the OECD said. 
  Even so, it stressed, growth would be too slow to check a 
still-worsening jobless rate, likely to peak at 12.5 percent by 
year-end, for an annual average of 12.4 percent both in 1994 and 
1995 against 11.6 percent in 1993. 
  The OECD also warned that recovery in France "hinges on a 
turnaround of activity in the rest of Europe." 
  "There is a risk that it will be delayed again or be weaker 
than projected," it said. 
  The OECD's projections assumed that French monetary 
authorities would stick to the "cautious" stance they adopted 
after the widening last August of the bands of fluctuation in 
the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). 
  On this basis, the OECD said, French short-term interest 
rates were expected to decline further "in line with German 
rates" to about 4 percent by end-1995. 
  However, it said, if German rates fell less than projected 
-- 
because of a worsening German inflation outlook or similar 
hitches -- "French authorities would have to consider how to 
continue their policy of gradual interest rate reductions while 
maintaining their stable currency strategy" -- aimed at keeping 
a steady franc-German mark relationship in the ERM. 
  "As no room for fiscal manoeuvre is left, this would be the 
only way to support demand," the report stressed. 
  Lower short-term rates and positive wealth effects could 
stimulate activity, and with inflation under control and the 
exchange rate broadly in line with fundamentals, there would be 
"little risk of adverse impacts" on long-term rates, it pointed 
out. 
  Making their point clearer, OECD economists said a "crucial" 
issue for French monetary policy in the new ERM environment was 
"whether and how a greater degree of monetary autonomy can be 
achieved" without upsetting ERM currency stability. 
  They suggested a new set of "clear objectives and rules" for 
monetary policy, tying short-term interest rates not only to 
exchange rates but also to such indicators as money supply, a 
range of inflation data, the yield curve and the level of 
long-term interest rates. 
  If a "credible" framework was achieved along these lines, 
long-term rates could "durably decline below German levels," 
they said. 
  The OECD also warned that in the absence of a "sufficiently 
strong European-wide recovery," France would have to further 
rebalance its policy mix "in order to make rapid progress" in 
cutting the towering budget deficit which reached 5.8 percent of 
GDP last year. 
  While most of the deficit widening since 1991 was cyclical, 
the structural component had also worsened, and the overall 
deficit was now "clearly unsustainable" because it entailed a 
rapid rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio. 
  The report welcomed government moves to tighten fiscal 
policy 
this year, its longer-term programme aimed at cutting the 
state's deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 1997, and last year's 
structural measures to put the social security system on a sound 
financial footing. 
  But it said action towards these targets was needed "without 
delay," and reform of the social protection system must be 
completed even at the cost of "short-term hardship" for some 
groups. 
  With deficit-reduction risking to dampen recovery, the OECD 
said, continued cuts in interest rates were all the more 
warranted.

  [Text] Paris, March 10 (AFP) -- Air France, the 
loss-making state-owned French airline, unveiled its 3.5 billion 
dollar restructuring plan Thursday [10 March], which calls for 
5,000 job cuts and a three-year wage freeze -- measures likely 
to draw sharp protest from the company's militant unions. 
  The 20 billion-franc (3.5 billion-dollar) recapitalization 
plan is to be spread over three years, according to company 
officials who handed the plan to the group's unions Thursday. 
  The plan includes 5,000 job losses, though no sackings, and 
a 
three-year wage freeze. The recapitalization is conditioned on 
the plan's acceptance by the workforce. 
  Apart from the capital injection, the plan calls for 
increased productivity, a cut in the wage bill and 
reorganization of the company. 
  The aim is to transform Air France from an "institution" 
into 
an "business," with a 30 percent increase in productivity over 
three years to achieve balance by 1997. 
  Union leaders are to meet the new president of Air France, 
Christian Blanc, who replaced Bernard Attali after a strike last 
October, on Thursday to discuss the plan. 
  Francois Cabrera of the CFDT [French Democratic 
Confederation 
of Labor] union said early Thursday that the refusal to inject 
vital resources without first guaranteeing union acceptance 
amounted to blackmail. 
  Blanc's plan outlines a "wage freeze over three years with a 
complete block in the first year and possible adjustments in 
1995 and 1996 depending on results," Cabrera said. 
  The government said Wednesday that the allocation of second 
and third tranches of new capital would depend on the success of 
the restructuring. 
  Since a strike last October forced the government to abandon 
an earlier restructuring plan, Air France's bankers have been 
paying its monthly fuel and salary bills. 
  Under the Blanc rescue plan, Air France workers, who last 
October stopped flights into Paris by occupiing runways at the 
city's two main airports, were offered shares in the national 
carrier in return for the pay cuts. 
  "The goal is that in three years a significant part of the 
capital of the company should belong to the personnel of Air 
France" (now 99.3 percent state-owned), Blanc said in a letter 
to workers. 
  French Industry and External Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, 
in Tokyo Thursday, said that the need to recapitalize Air France 
had forced the government to privatise insurance group Assurance 
Generales de France (AGF). 
  "We need a little more money, because you don't get 
something 
for nothing. We need money for Air France," he said. "We are 
selling one asset in order to revive another asset." 
  Air France lost around 7.5 billion francs in 1993, 
equivalent 
to 13 percent of sales, and has debts totalling 6.1 billion 
dollars.

<F P=106> [Report by Adolfo Garrido: "People's Party Attributes New </F>
Nationalist Demands to Government Weakness"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party believes that the 
government's concessions to the nationalist forces made to 
ensure continued power have reopened the autonomy issue. This 
became clear during the meeting of the party's standing 
committee, comprised of members of its Executive Committee and 
regional leaders. It was also decided during the meeting to set 
up a committee to study the process of implementing autonomy. 
  The People's Party also advocates discontinuing the 
negotiations on the so-called "democratic impetus" in all the 
institutions, according to what national party Chairman Jose 
Maria Aznar told the committee members. 
  Although the state of the negotiations on each of the 
institutions was not addressed at that meeting, People's Party 
Secretary General Francisco Alvarez Cascos will set out today 
the results of the negotiations with the Socialist Party, 
Information Office Director Miguel Angel Rodriguez announced. 
  Nevertheless, the standing committee devoted much of the 
time 
to studying in depth the document on the definition of the model 
of the state of the autonomous communities. The People's Party 
members believe that the government's weakness has caused a 
flood of new autonomy demands. 
<H5>  Government's Weakness </H5>
  "The Socialists have opened the window for concessions, and 
now they do not know how to shut it," Rodriguez stated. 
According to the People's Party, the government's weakness has 
caused the transfer of powers to certain autonomous communities 
with the sole aim of ensuring parliamentary support. 
  The party led by Aznar also deems "problematic" some 
aspirations attributed to the Generalitat [autonomous 
government] of Catalonia which "could exceed what is envisaged 
by the Constitution," and which took shape in an unofficial 
document which became known several weeks ago. 
  The aim of the People's Party proposal is to determine 
clearly the kind of state and powers which each administrations 
should have. 
  The chief opposition force's intention is to debate with 
other political and social forces the document presented by 
Aznar in Barcelona last month, although no contact has been made 
for the present. 
  The People's Party will give priority to the problems of 
funding the autonomous communities, the communities' 
participation in European bodies, and the single administration 
principle in the committee on autonomous communities. The 
committee will soon be set up and will be chaired by party 
Deputy Secretary General Mariano Rajoy. 
  The People's Party believes that the "cafe for everybody" 
formula should not be applied, and will insist on a debate on 
how the autonomous communities are to be funded and how the 
single administration principle proposed by Manuel Fraga is to 
be carried out. 
  In addition, at the standing committee meeting Aznar 
referred 
to the European building process, and supported the European 
Union's enlargement, but not at the cost of harming Spain's 
interests. The possible harm to Spanish fishing should be taken 
into account in the negotiations on the entry of Austria, 
Sweden, Finland, and Norway.

  [Text] In spite of the fishing crisis and a generally low 
level of economic activity in Greenland, the Greenland Bank had 
a surplus of 42.1 million kroner in 1993 compared with a deficit 
of 6.9 million the year before. This is due primarily to falling 
interest rates that led to an exchange rate profit on bonds. The 
exchange rate loss of 22.2 million kroner in 1992 changed to a 
surplus of 32.6 million kroner in 1992. Greenland Bank's general 
banking operations were almost unchanged in relation to 1992. 
However, net interest and fee income rose from 74.5 million to 
83.8 million kroner. Losses and set-asides amounted to 8.2 
million kroner in 1993 -- almost the same as in 1992.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Schaumann: "Industry Optimistic About the </F>
Future"] 
  [Text] Industrial leaders' future expectations have moved 
from black pessimism to radiant optimism in less than a year. 
  The leaders of a majority of Denmark's 700 largest firms 
have 
undergone a striking change in attitude. Not since the 
"unbelievably" good years in the mid-1980's when Prime Minister 
Poul Schluter (Conservative) was at the helm have industrial 
leaders believed as strongly as they do today that they will 
both employ more workers and increase investments. 
  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE asked Jyske Bank to analyze a survey of 
the industrial situation that the Danish Bureau of Statistics 
published yesterday. The results can be seen in two of the 
graphs below [not reproduced here]. It is less than a year since 
a large majority of industrial leaders anticipated layoffs and 
no investments. 
  "The shift is quite striking. It is very, very fine," said 
economist Jorgen Damgaard of Jyske Bank, who analyzed the survey. 
<H5>  Positive View of Own Possibilities </H5>
  "When industrial leaders are asked to give their opinion 
about the possibilities of the general national development with 
respect to creating more jobs, they are still negative. But when 
it comes to their own firms most have finally become positive," 
Damgaard noted. 
  The 700 industrial leaders, whose firms account for a good 
60 
percent of the jobs in Danish industry, answer questions from 
the Danish Bureau of Statistics each quarter. The assessments in 
the new edition of the survey apply to the first three months of 
the year. 
  When the answers are corrected for the size of the firm and 
the traditional annually recurring pessimism here before spring 
arrives, they show that a majority of 12 percent of the firms 
anticipate hiring more workers in the first quarter of the year. 
<H5>  More Will Invest </H5>
  And an equally strong shift has occurred with respect to 
investment plans. 
  A majority of 12 percent of the firms are also considering 
concrete investment plans. 
  If these figures are more or less borne out -- and they 
usually are -- it is only a question of time before surveys of 
what has actually happened also document progress. 
  It is also worth noting in relation to industry's situation 
that inventories are at their lowest point in several years. At 
the same time export orders have now risen to such an extent 
that they are back to normal. 
<H5>  Marked Change in Attitude </H5>
  If the new indications from industrial leaders are viewed in 
light of the fact that private consumers are also optimistic now 
-- as shown by a poll conducted by the Danish Bureau of 
Statistics at the beginning of January -- there has been a real 
change in people's attitudes. 
  According to the poll, people think Denmark's economic 
situation is already better than it was a year ago, and they 
also believe that things will be even better a year from now. 
  A good 12-percent majority of those questioned also believe 
that the family's economic situation will improve within the 
next year. 
<H5>  Less Anxiety About Unemployment </H5>
  At the same time, people's anxiety that unemployment will 
rise further is receding very quickly. All in all the so-called 
consumer confidence index has risen from minus three to plus 
three in a single month. 
  Economy Minister Marianne Jelved (Radical Liberal) said: 
"People have begun to believe that it is true that there will be 
an upswing. And then there is a positive spiral. When 
expectations are positive, people also behave differently. I do 
not believe we will have total lack of restraint and 
overheating. However, loan conversions and tax reform have 
really put more money in people's pockets. The extra available 
cash that families have has increased in a way that they can 
really feel. At the same time unemployment has stopped rising."

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Next Generation Will Have To </F>
Take Over Growing National Economy"] 
  [Text] The deep recession that has struck Finland has also 
brought some good with it. The municipalities have realized that 
they cannot continue to expand as they did in the late 1980's, 
and the public sector has had to cut back on its bureaucracy. 
But the recession has also given rise to problems -- among them 
high unemployment and the still growing public debt -- that we 
will leave behind us for the next generation. 
  That is the opinion of Pekka Parkkinen, a researcher at the 
State Economic Research Institute (VATT). Parkkinen has produced 
a forecast under the title "What the Generations Have Inherited 
in Finland," and his view of what we will leave to coming 
generations is mainly favorable. The spiral of indebtedness can 
be interrupted, all the talk about a huge deficit in the pension 
fund is exaggerated, and the national wealth we will leave 
behind us totals far more than 1 trillion markkas. 
  Moreover, the next generation will have received a solid 
education that, thanks to its parents, society has paid for. 
Education and research are the most important things we can 
bequeath, and they constitute a sector where we must not 
economize, Parkkinen says. 
  But he refuses to call himself an optimist, claiming instead 
that his view of the future is realistic. The biggest threat to 
the future of the Finns is not to be found anywhere within our 
country's borders. It is not the national debt or unemployment: 
The threat comes from the East. Unrest in Russia is the thing 
that would have the most negative influence on Finland's future. 
  "Our own problems we can take care of, but global problems 
such as environmental pollution or widespread war are things we 
cannot manage," says Parkkinen. 
<H5>  Declining Debt </H5>
  The foreign debt has been regarded as one of today's major 
problems, but Parkkinen points out that if exports continue to 
rise as they are doing now, that problem will be solved 
relatively quickly in the private sector. Foreign loans will 
make it worthwhile to finance investments yielding at least as 
much as the interest on the foreign debt, Parkkinen believes. 
But most of the foreign debt contracted by the state has been 
used to finance bank subsidies, unemployment benefits, and other 
public transfers of income. 
  And the national debt will continue to grow if economic 
growth turns out to be around 2 percent per year, Parkkinen 
believes. According to him, an optimal growth rate would be 4 
percent, since it would then be possible to halt the growth in 
the national debt by the turn of the century. Otherwise, it is 
impossible to predict how long the debt will continue to rise 
and how much it will rise. The debt is a problem that the next 
generation will have to contend with and that it will have to 
pay. 
  Parkkinen believes that Finland's national economy will 
continue to grow satisfactorily during the rest of the 1990's. 
Company profits are rising, and that in turn is leading to new 
investments, which in turn create new jobs. Faith in the future 
is returning, and people are gradually venturing to borrow and 
to use their money again -- many people need a new home or a new 
car. There will be a favorable chain reaction. 
<H5>  Idle Citizens </H5>
  But not even new industrial investment can create enough new 
jobs. Unemployment will continue to be a problem, Parkkinen 
emphasizes. We must do what we can to avoid creating a 
generation that has never gotten accustomed to working -- a 
group of idle citizens in society that people who work will have 
to pay for. 
  On that subject, Parkkinen sees an opportunity in an 
integrated Europe and the European Economic Area agreement. They 
will give our well-educated young people a chance to enter the 
Central European labor market, stay there a few years and 
increase their capital, and then come home richer both 
spiritually and materially a few years later. True, there is an 
obvious risk that many will stay in Central Europe, but the open 
labor market provides a good opportunity, he feels. 
  "There is no instant solution to the unemployment problems. 
We will have to make further cutbacks in the public sector, and 
when agriculture is slimmed down for the EU [European Union], 
there will also be unemployment in that sector." 
<H5>  No Pension Bomb </H5>
  But even though the large age groups will gradually enter 
the 
pension age, and even though the public's unemployment problems 
will remain, Parkkinen does not believe there is a "pension 
bomb." With the national economy growing by a couple of percent 
annually, there will be enough money to pay pensions, although 
it means that the working population will have to pay higher 
pension contributions. But wages will also be higher in the 
future, he says. 
  What a small country like Finland must safeguard in all 
situations is research and education, and in that respect, 
Parkkinen believes that we have intelligent and farsighted 
politicians. If we cut back too far on education and worsen its 
quality, we can say good-bye to all favorable development. 
  One factor over which we have no control is environmental 
pollution on a global scale. Parkkinen says he is not worried by 
Western industrial production's influence on the environment, 
but at a time when the industrialized countries are reducing 
their discharges of pollutants, discharges of "greenhouse 
gases," for example, are increasing in the Third World. 
  "Each generation leaves behind an environment that is poorer 
in natural resources than it was before, and what we have right 
now is a steadily deteriorating environment." 
  Parkkinen points out, however, that he feels that Finnish 
ecology is well managed. He feels that globally, reducing 
environmental problems will require a kind of development aid 
for the environment. 
  Pekka Parkkinen's view of the future we will bequeath to the 
next generation is rather positive. He says, however, that the 
farther into the future one tries to see, the harder it becomes.

<F P=106> [Article by Dick Ljungberg: "Large Voter Loss for Liberal </F>
Party: Social Democrats Increase Again"] 
  [Text] The Liberal Party declined dramatically in DN/Temo's 
voter barometer during February, the first of the 1994 election 
year. New Democracy is also on the downswing. The polls' 
winners are the Social Democrats and the Center Party. 
  Seven months before the election, the governing parties are 
showing no signs of eroding the Social Democrats' large lead. 
On the contrary, the nonsocialists are losing some ground at 
the same time the Social Democrats are moving up for the first 
time in six months. 
  With the Liberal Party's loss, a total of five parties are 
bunched up around the 4-percent hurdle for Riksdag 
representation. The Liberals, New Democracy, and the Christian 
Democrats are just above the line; the Left Party and Green 
Party just below it. 
  Therefore, uncertainty is significantly increasing about 
what 
proportional parliamentary representation the 18 September 
election will result in and what government will be formed. 
  The Temo polling was done between 24 January and 17 February 
and consisted of 1,046 interviews, conducted during visits to 
the respondents' homes. Only 9.5 percent said that they could 
not or would not choose a party; this percentage was 11 in 
December. 
<H5>  Near a Breakup </H5>
  Since then the government has presented its budget, and the 
opposition has replied with its shadow budget. The government 
was near breakup over the Oresund Bridge at the beginning of the 
year. Ian Wachtmeister announced his resignation as party 
leader, with ensuing commotion within New Democracy. The 
government was finally united on family policy; there would be 
child-care subsidies, reduced compensation in parental 
insurance, and paternal leave. The three largest parties 
compromised on a new pension system. 
  The results, with the changes since December in parentheses: 
the Moderates 21 percent (+ .5), the Liberal Party 5 (- 3), 
the Center 9 (+ 2), the Christian Democrats 4 (- .5), Green 
Party 3 (unchanged), Social Democrats 49 (+ 2), Left Party 3.5 
(+ .5), New Democracy 4.5 (- 2), and other parties 1 (+ .5). 
The Liberal Party's and New Democracy's losses are outside the 
margin of error. 
  In February the governing parties together had 39 percent of 
the votes, a decrease of 1 percent since December. In the 1991 
election they totaled 46.6 percent. The Moderates, after a dip 
at the end of last year, have now moved up in two polls and are 
once again at the 21-percent mark, near their election result of 
21.9 percent. The Moderates are also stronger than all three 
other ruling parties put together. 
<H5>  Bridge War </H5>
  Such a large loss as the Liberal Party's should be noted 
with 
caution. The party reached the low-water mark in February of 
last year, but then they remained at 6-6.5 percent for a long 
time. The Liberal Party climbed back up to a level around 7-8 
percent. Additional results are needed to see if the Liberals 
have now ended up at a lower level near the cutoff for the 
Riksdag. In the 1991 election the Liberal Party got 9.1 percent. 
  One can only speculate on whether the war of nerves over the 
Oresund Bridge is behind the Center Party's increase to 9 
percent, which means that the party, for the first time in the 
government's term, is above its election result of 8.5 percent. 
Otherwise, 8 percent -- which the Center has reached twice, 
once as late as the fall of 1991 -- is the highest the party has 
been. 
  The child-care subsidy and "Christian ethics" in schools' 
lesson plans has not improved the Christian Democrats' results. 
Since March of last year, the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] 
has remained at less than 5 percent in Temo. Life outside the 
Riksdag is threatening the KDS, which entered in 1991 with 7.1 
percent, but immediately disappeared into anonymity in the 
government. 
<H5>  Great Attention </H5>
  New Democracy is losing ground after having been at 6.5 
percent -- that is almost equal to their election result of 6.7 
percent -- nearly all of last year. The new record low -- 4.5 
percent is the lowest Temo measurement for New Democracy -- was 
reached before Ian Wachtmeister announced his resignation on 
Saturday, 5 February. Temo's results surprisingly showed a 
small increase for New Democracy after Wachtmeister's 
announcement, perhaps as a result of the great attention the 
party received in the media. 
  The Social Democrats can be happy about the new strength in 
Temo before next weekend's election conference with LO [National 
Federation of Trade Unions] in Bommersvik. From the record high 
level of 50.5 percent last spring and summer, the Social 
Democrats fell in two polls to 47 percent. The next poll will 
show whether the first increase in six months breaks the trend. 
In the 1991 election the Social Democrats got only 37.7 percent. 
<H5>  Left Living Dangerously </H5>
  The Left Party is still living dangerously. Out of 16 Temo 
polls since the 1991 election, the Left Party has reached 4 
percent in six; in the rest they have been under the cutoff. In 
the latest election the result was 4.5 percent. 
  The Green Party got 3 percent for the third time in a row, a 
higher level than they had received earlier in the election 
period, and cannot be counted out of the fight for Riksdag 
representation. In the last election the Greens left parliament 
with 3.4 percent. 
  There will many opinion polls from various institutes this 
election year. The polls are difficult to compare; they were 
carried out under different time periods and with different 
methods. In addition, the changes are often contradictory. The 
levels for the various parties over several rating periods 
usually coincide very well between institutes.

  [Excerpt] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative in Cyprus, submitted to 
President Glavkos Kliridhis a draft document from UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the seven key points of the 
proximity talks agenda on confidence-building measures [CBM's]. 
Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said Kliridhis asked 
for time to study the draft document, and during talks tomorrow 
[10 March] and the following day he will raise a number of 
questions to clarify certain points. Kasoulidhis said the 
president will brief political leaders on the draft document 
during separate meetings tomorrow and the following day. 
  The spokesman said that the proximity talks are entering a 
serious phase. Asked whether he agrees with the evaluation of 
Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on 
the Cyprus issue, that the CBM's are the first opportunity in 
decades to find a Cyprus solution, Kasoulidhis said it is a 
significant opportunity. The spokesman concluded by saying that 
the Cypriot Government is in daily contact with the Greek 
Government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "One Per Day" column by Panayiotis Paskhalis: </F>
"Confidence-Building Measures: One-Way Road"] 
  [Excerpts] Developments that have brought the long-running 
Cyprus issue to its current, most critical, phase did not appear 
out of the blue but rather came from the calculations of those 
in power. 
  We have repeatedly stressed that Cyprus is under the 
pressure 
of the powerful in the world, who, in our case, are none other 
than the Americans and the British. According to their will and 
political-military interests, they use the United Nations 
organizations through the Security Council, which they control 
with a majority. [passage omitted] 
  First, it was President Glavkos Kliridhis' unconditional 
acceptance of the famous confidence-building measures [CBM's] 
without the knowledge of the country's political leadership. 
After accepting the CBM's in principle, he proceeded to discuss 
their implementation without accepting, before the eyes of every 
common man, the reports of the experts. These UN experts 
visited and explained the CBM's to the president, who accepted 
them without discussion but succeeded in uniting all political 
parties against them. 
  No one accepted these measures, but the discussion on their 
implementation has gone on since 17 February. Every time you 
come to them, you realize how far we are from the principles and 
decisions, not only of the Security Council resolutions, but 
also of the international accords for which humanity has made 
huge sacrifices. 
  With a presidential will that is translated into 
stubbornness, we started the dance of the CBM's. Like every 
dance, it must end some time. Officials have often told us that 
the experts' reports are not official UN documents. But they 
are on the negotiating table and each side can use them as it 
desires to support its positions. 
  The UN secretary general's latest report also refers to the 
experts' reports and they can now be passed as official 
documents, with our side still maintaining the illusion in 
simple statements that these reports are not official UN 
documents. Again, the evaluations of the Republic's Presidency, 
which is isolated from the rest of the leadership, are proven 
wrong at the expense of our national intrest. [passage omitted] 
  As all the developments indicate, the confidence-building 
measures have put us on a one-way road with no chance of return. 
Whether we like it or not, this road should come to an end in a 
"few weeks," as ordered by those who today control and lead the 
United Nations and its bodies. 
  It is our duty, as Cypriots, to find those roads, which, 
through firm steps, will lead to the establishment of a real 
climate of confidence without fear, in which all our countrymen, 
irrespective of race or religion, will enjoy their right to a 
united homeland.

  [Text] Diyarbakir/Ankara--Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of 
the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan], has vowed to upgrade violence in Turkey's Southeast 
in mid-March and said the region "will turn into hell." 
  According to a reliable source with well-placed connections 
to the PKK Central Committee, Ocalan said this in a recent 
meeting with his commanders in charge of terrorist activities 
against Turkey. 
  Ocalan's instructions to the commanders were to upgrade 
violence in the region until the celebrations for the March 21 
Kurdish new year of Nevroz and beginning as of that day, "start 
a people's uprising." 
  His instructions, said the source, were similar to those in 
1992 and implied that the consequences of the Nevroz this year 
could be similar as well. In March 1992, Ocalan ordered a 
Kurdish uprising in Turkey and called for the establishment of 
"liberated zones." A total of 103 demonstrators were killed in 
clashes with security forces. 
  Local sources in Diyarbakir said, meanwhile, that the PKK's 
instructions related to Nevroz celebrations had not yet been 
relayed to anyone but heightened activity and public 
demonstrations were possible. 
  They note that the recent troop buildup in the region is not 
only a measure to maintain electoral security but also to insure 
peace on March 21. 
  According to one security source who asked not to be 
identified, "if the PKK decides to do anything this year, there 
will be much bloodshed. But it will be the loser." 
  The general concern among political party executives in 
Diyarbakir is that Turkey may be preparing for an all-out 
showdown with the PKK and that any terrorist activity in late 
March could trigger this "operation."

  [Text] [Announcer] An official EC spokesperson has said 
that European Commission President Jacques Delors understands 
the Spanish stance regarding the fishing issue linked to the 
enlargement of the EC to Norway, but he does not agree with 
maintaining a blockade of a minority of votes because this would 
complicate decisionmaking. 
  The EC enlargement negotiations with Norway are postponed 
until 15 March because of Spain's firm stance regarding fishing 
rights, as well as the issue of voting at the Council of 
Ministers. 
  Vicente Albero, the Spanish minister for agriculture and 
fisheries, in statements to our station said that regarding the 
fishing issue, we can not be deemed selfish. On the contrary, 
we are trying to uphold important Community principles. 
  For his part, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Durao 
Barroso has repeated his support for the Spanish stance 
regarding fishing in Norway, and he added that Portugal also 
claims its right to fish in Norwegian waters. 
  Today, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso arrived in Madrid to close 
the two-day seminar held by the Spanish and Portuguese 
ambassadors stationed in Maghreb countries. 
  Regarding the meeting Jose Manuel Durao Barroso is scheduled 
to have with his Spanish counterpart, Javier Solana, he said his 
country, as well as Spain, is very interested in strengthening 
relations with North African countries, and both countries are 
putting their case to the European Union [EU]. 
  Jose Manuel Durao Barroso underlined that Spain and Portugal 
have similar stances regarding this issue because Europe does 
not only have a frontier with East and Central European 
countries. Europe's southern frontier with the North African 
countries is also very important.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Signal for Expansion of Railway </F>
Transit"] 
  [Text] One week after the conclusion of the accession 
talks with the European Union [EU], the Federal Government 
adopted a decision of principle on Tuesday [8 March] to "offer 
support to those lines of business that would be directly facing 
adaptation problems in the event of EU membership." Talks with 
the industries affected and the social partners should be 
initiated as soon as possible. 
  At a joint news conference after the cabinet meeting, 
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek 
stressed that the most important thing is to make it clear to 
the citizens that all required measures are being introduced at 
full speed. Vranitzky spoke of a "clear signal," and Busek 
described this signal as the precondition for making use of the 
economic opportunities that the European Union offers. 
  Both Vranitzky and Busek spoke in favor of making available 
the required financial funds to accelerate restructuring, even 
though this would result in a higher budget deficit. For 
Vranitzky, this is a kind of "payment on account" for an 
improvement of the economy and for a higher tax revenue expected 
to result therefrom. Busek clearly prefers "using the funds for 
measures that promote developments instead of financing 
unemployment." 
  The government's declaration of principle explicitly notes 
that the "integration of Austria's agriculture into the Common 
Agricultural Policy will by no means be a shock because measures 
will be taken--financed by the European Union, the provinces, 
and the government--which will, in the long run, ensure the 
existence of the farmers and the processing industry." 
  The government also stressed the special significance of a 
solution to the transit problem. Thus, the declaration of 
principle mentions Austria's intention "to ensure the 
environmental goals of the transit agreement on a permanent 
basis beyond the duration of the agreement by shifting quickly 
and to a greater extent traffic from the roads to the railways. 
For this reason, the Austrian Government advocates the 
expansion of railway lines on the transit routes. In this 
respect, the quick expansion of the railway line in the 
Unterinntal valley and the construction of the Brenner tunnel, 
for which the European Union has promised funds, assumes great 
significance." 
  The government's goal is to strengthen Austria's 
competitiveness with a view to entry into the European Union. 
The declaration of principle was jointly presented to the 
cabinet by Vranitzky and Busek. 
  The head of government and his deputy proposed shifting 
freight traffic quickly from the roads to the railways, 
particularly in Tirol. Even without membership in the European 
Union, Austria would have had to tackle this problem. It is now 
important to make use of the promised funds of the European 
Union. 
  Referring to the Unterinntal valley railway tunnel, 
Vranitzky 
expressed the conviction that the government formed after the 
provincial elections will accept his governments's offer for 
early talks. In fact, Governor Wendelin Weingartner threatened 
to reject the European Union unless Tirol's interests are taken 
into consideration. Yet he, Vranitzky, considered it more 
useful to respond to this statement with an offer for talks. 
Since the Austrian railways are currently in the process of 
planning the Unterinntal valley line, details of the tunnel 
should be coordinated with Tirolean authorities as soon as 
possible. 
  Busek stressed that these railway projects are very 
labor-intensive and will ensure jobs. Moreover, Weingartner has 
also made it clear that EU membership also offers numerous 
opportunities for Tirol. The possibilities of a transit 
solution are "closer than ever before." As a result of EU 
membership, the border between north and south Tirol will 
"largely be removed." Busek is convinced that, also from 
Weingartner's point of view, the advantages of EU membership 
outweigh the disadvantages. 
  Busek also emphasized the fact that various foreign 
companies make investments dependent on Austria's EU membership. 
This will provide additional stimulus for the economy. 
  According to Vranitzky, the exact date of the referendum on 
the European Union cannot be determined at this point because it 
also depends on talks within the European Union -- on the 
blocking minority, for example. Whether it will be held on 12 
or 19 June will also depend on the parliamentary schedule. 
Transportation Minister Klima stated that, even without the 
Brenner tunnel, a four-track railway line is required in the 
Unterinntal valley because short-distance traffic is already 
creating problems at this point. The section between Woergl and 
Innsbruck is particularly critical where two railway lines meet 
-- the Inntal valley line and the line to Bischofshofen. 
  The financing procedure will ultimately depend on the 
estimated costs, and these in turn will depend on the wishes of 
the neighboring communes concerning the route. In individual 
sections, deviations form the planned route would double the 
costs. The railway head office in Innsbruck has for months been 
holding talks on the route with the neighboring communes. 
  The feasibility study of the Brenner tunnel, which is being 
prepared under the leadership of a general consultant, will be 
completed by June this year, Klima stated. A decision will be 
made in October when, how fast, and whether the Brenner tunnel 
will be built at all. In the spirit of the agreement with the 
European Union, the project will be financed out of the federal 
budget and EU funds. During a short visit to Tirol, Foreign 
Minister Alois Mock announced on Tuesday that he will support 
the provision of EU funds for the railway tunnel in the 
Unterinntal valley. Mock was "optimistic" that he will be able 
to achieve the same kind of support that was promised for the 
Brenner tunnel. Tirol Governor Wendelin Weingartner stressed 
once more that Tirol's "yes" to the European Union will depend 
on binding promises concerning the financing of the Unterinntal 
valley railway line. He welcomed the cabinet's decision on the 
expansion of the railway network as a step in the right 
direction. His deputy Hans Tanzer described Weingartner's 
threatening gestures as superfluous. Tirol can rely on 
Chancellor Vranitzky and the Federal Government. Joerg Haider, 
chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], criticized 
Weingartner's talks with the government as a "spectacle" and a 
"political maneuver designed to deceive the citizens." Whereas 
the government headed by Vranitzky has adopted another 
"halfhearted declaration of principle" without presenting 
specific plans and figures concerning the expansion of the 
railway network, Tirol is being increasingly neglected, the 
opposition leader pointed out. The FPOe will hold a special 
conference on the European Union in Villach on 8 April. 
  Catholic Action has published a memorandum as an aid for the 
decision on the European Union but did not recommend a specific 
position.

<F P=106> [By Teilo Colley and Keith Manning, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Excerpts] Terrorists tonight launched five mortars in an 
attack on Heathrow Airport -- but they all apparently failed to 
go off. The devices were in a Datsun car in a hotel car park 
close to the airport in West Drayton, West London, and there 
were no reports of any injuries, Scotland Yard said. 
  News of the attack was announced by Home Secretary Michael 
Howard in the Commons as MPs were discussing renewing the 
contentious Prevention of Terrorism Act. He later said the IRA 
had to be the prime suspect for the attack. 
  Eyewitnesses spoke of bangs and blazing cars in the car park 
of the Excelsior Hotel which is on the perimeter of the airport. 
  Anti-terrorist officers were on the scene and an intensive 
search of the airport was under way. Heathrow confirmed that 
the northern runway, which is the closest to the the hotel, was 
operating at the time of the attack. It was only closed 
afterwards. 
  "It is used by landing aircraft, but there can be quite a 
gap 
between landings at this time of night. It's very unlikely that 
aircraft would have been landing at the time," said an airport 
spokeswoman. 
  A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "Police are investigating 
what appears to be a mortar attack at Heathrow airport. It is 
believed that the mortar attack was fired at approximately 1757 
from a Datsun motor vehicle in a car park at the Excelsior Hotel 
on the perimeter of the airport near the junction with Sipson 
Road and Bath Road. It appears five mortars were fired. There 
are no reports of detonations. It's believed the mortars were 
targeted towards the airport. There are no reports of injuries. 
Anti-terrorist branch officers are in attendance and an 
extensive search of the airport is currently being conducted for 
the unexploded mortars." 
  In an apparent misleading warning, Sky News received a 
telephone call from a man with an Irish accent saying that there 
would be explosions inside the airport about 50 minutes before 
the mortar attack was fired from outside the perimeter fence. 
[passage omitted] 
  Mr Howard told Channel 4 News: "If it was meant to send a 
signal to the House of Commons, I think it is a pity that the 
House of Commons was unable to give a united response because 
the Labour Party did not come into the lobby with us to support 
the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. But the 
majority in favour of the renewal of those powers was a big 
majority. So if this was a signal from the terrorists, they got 
their answer from the House of Commons." 
  Mr Howard did not accuse the IRA of the mortar attack, but 
indicated it had to be the prime suspect given the timing 
coinciding with the terrorism debate in Parliament. [passage 
omitted] 
  Tonight's attack is the first major terrorist incident on 
the 
British mainland since the Anglo-Irish declaration on peace in 
Northern Ireland was signed in December. 
  Last month an undercover operation appeared to smash a bid 
to 
mount a huge IRA mainland campaign. Police in Accrington, 
Lancashire, seized arms and explosives in a swoop in which two 
men were arrested. 
  In January and February, the IRA targeted shops in the West 
End of London as part of a firebomb blitz. 
  Before Christmas, in the days after the historic Downing 
Street signing of the declaration, the IRA kept up its mainland 
campaign, with bombs and hoaxes aimed at rail travellers.

<F P=106> [Article signed SM/VF: "Human Rights Situation in China: </F>
The Commission Decides `Not To Adjudge'"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Geneva, 9 Mar (ATS) -- The UN Human Rights 
Commission decided on Wednesday [9 March], with 20 votes for, 16 
against, and 17 abstentions, not to pass a resolution on human 
rights violations in China. This resolution had been proposed 
by 16 countries, including Switzerland. 
  The resolution specifically cited an "inadequate protection" 
of Tibetan identity and the identity of other Chinese 
minorities. The Commission declared itself to be very worried 
by the continuous reports on violations of fundamental rights; 
on torture; and on serious restrictions on freedom of expression 
and religion as well as on the right to a fair trial. The 
resolution finally asked the Beijing government to take "new 
steps" to improve this situation. 
  Before the vote, the United Kingdom suggested rejecting the 
"nondecision" motion proposed by China in order to "preserve the 
credibility" of the Commission, which is often accused of 
"harassing small countries." The United States took the same 
attitude, and emphasized that China did not have to be treated 
differently from other countries "just because of its economic 
potential and its size." 
  On the other hand, Pakistan, which supported the Beijing 
motion, stated that China had "accelerated its reform process" 
in the past year. Sri Lanka declared that the best road toward 
improving human rights was not through the resolution proposed 
at the Commission, but through persuasion and a real dialogue.

<F P=106> [Government statement by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at a </F>
Bundestag session in Bonn -- live] 
  [Text] Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Remembering 
the historic importance of overcoming the division of the 
European continent and the necessity to establish firm 
foundations for the shape of the future Europe, the European 
Union [EU] was founded, as the preamble of the Maastricht Treaty 
says. It is open to European democracies that commit themselves 
to the goals of the European Union. The current expansion by 
four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries -- namely 
Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria -- is the first one since 
the end of the Cold War. Their accession to the European Union 
will finally put an end to the competition of two West European 
concepts for the future shaping of our continent. 
  The current model of the European Union, which is equipped 
with common institutions, has managed to dominate over the idea 
of a simple free trade zone. This is of extraordinary and 
important significance for the future European system. 
[applause] 
  Already, today the European Union forms the one anchor of 
stability on our continent and reliably prevents the return of 
nation states and changing coalitions to Europe. It stands for 
a large single market, which multiplies the prosperity of all 
member states and increases their international competitiveness, 
and it stands for a Europe of solidarity that has set for itself 
the goal of gradually harmonizing the differences in performance 
and prosperity within the European Union. 
  These are sufficient reasons for many European democracies 
to 
press into this union. Therefore, the current round of 
expansion will not and must not be the last one. [applause] 
  Its conclusion will prove that the European Union is capable 
of acting on the basis of the treaty, which came into force on 1 
November 1993. Being capable of action also means establishing 
a consensus to ensure peace in freedom and prosperity on our 
continent. The expansion will also -- and this is very 
important -- give an encouraging signal to the reform 
democracies in Central and East Europe that the European Union 
is not a closed society of the rich and the secure. [applause] 
  This also makes it clear that the united Germany will not 
remain the eastern border country of the European Union. It is 
moving into the center of Europe again, politically as well. 
[applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the acceptance of the three Nordic 
countries and of Austria into the European Union is an essential 
step on the path toward reestablishing the balance in Europe. 
The Federal Government has never identified itself with the 
concept of a western or southwestern union. It has always 
committed itself to the entire Europe. [applause] 
  Just as in the 1980's, we acted as the advocate of the 
expansion to the south and emphatically -- I stress the term 
emphatically for a special reason -- came out in favor of 
membership for Spain, Portugal, and Greece. From the very 
beginning we have energetically supported the desire of Austria, 
Sweden, Finland, and Norway to become members. The current 
round of negotiations is not taking place at the cost of 
Europe's southern countries. [applause] 
  Just like all other member states and the new members, they 
also will benefit from the fact that the European Union will be 
strengthened in political, economic, and cultural terms by the 
addition of four tested democratic states with efficient 
national economies that are committed to free world trade. 
  It is correct that the new members will better balance the 
European Union within itself, and it is obvious -- and we said 
this in Brussels during the negotiations and I am saying this 
here again -- that for Germany, in its central location, this is 
a not an unimportant benefit. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, during the current negotiations, the 
Federal Government has primarily been guided by the interest in 
strengthening the European Union and the stability of the entire 
Europe. German and European interests are identical on these 
questions. Germany's future is in Europe. 
  Security and the prosperity of our country are linked 
inseparably with European unification. A failure of these 
negotiations, a stalling of the European unification somewhere 
in the middle, would harm all Europeans. [applause] 
  Membership negotiations began on 1 January 1993, and in 
Norway's case on 1 April 1993. It is a really great achievement 
of all governments involved and of the Brussels Commission that 
these negotiations have practically been concluded with three 
states in approximately one year and that we are on the verge of 
a breakthrough with Norway. If the Council session next Tuesday 
[15 March] achieves this goal -- and the Federal Government will 
once again do everything possible to achieve this goal -- then 
there is a good chance that all four countries will be accepted 
into the European Union on time, on 1 January 1995, just as we 
planned. [applause] 
  I would like to expressly note that Germany cordially 
welcomes all four countries as close partners in the expanded 
European Union. [applause] 
  They enrich and strengthen the European Union. With the 
appropriate and necessary modesty, I would like to note that we 
certainly would not have come this far without the Federal 
Government's contribution. [applause] 
  I feel myself confirmed and justified that we pushed for 
speed, thus producing and passing on the necessary momentum, and 
helped as mediators. On this occasion, I would like to thank 
all those in the Federal Government and beyond who contributed 
to getting this far. Over the past weeks, we went through 
marathons that were unique even for Brussels. 
  The goal is right within our reach. It simply must not be 
that this expansion, which is so important for all of Europe, 
fails because of a few thousand tonnes of codfish. This cannot 
be right. [applause] 
  I stated during the negotiations at night that it really can 
not be right that we are negotiating and talking about 
dimensions, which amount to 2, 3, or 4 million ECU. Norway's 
accession must not fail because of that. [applause] 
  Nor must it be that the process of European unification 
suffers a serious setback because of internal problems among old 
members. No one should be deceived -- a failure of the 
membership negotiations would give rise to a serious crisis for 
Europe. Therefore, from this position, I appeal to the Spanish 
and, above all, also to the British Government to contribute 
constructively to achieving this goal that is so close now on 
Tuesday. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the expanded European Union will 
constitute the largest market in the world -- with 370 million 
people and a clearly higher economic capacity than the United 
States or Japan. Two out of three German jobs in exports depend 
on trade with this economic area. I say once again here in the 
German Bundestag: There is no large industrial and economic 
country that can be compared with Germany in terms of being 
dependent on one single region -- namely, Europe in this case. 
One must tell the Germans this again and again. 
[unintelligible interjections, applause] 
  From Germany's viewpoint, expansion is also advantageous 
because the ideas of the countries that want to join the 
European Union in terms of environmental protection and social 
safeguards largely correspond with our own. In addition, all 
new members -- perhaps also Finland -- will be net payers. At 
the beginning, this will not be fully effective because the 
European Union will help them with overcoming the difficult 
problems at the beginning, but later on, it will be important. 
In the medium term, the accession of economically strong 
European neighbors will contribute to easing the burden on 
Germany. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the participation of the four 
countries in the development of the EU's foreign and security 
policy will be an important advantage. Austria, Sweden, and 
Finland, which have been neutral so far, also accept -- and this 
is very important -- the foreign policy achievements of the 
European Union without any if's, and's, or but's and commit 
themselves to the goals set down in the treaty. 
  By the way -- and this should not be forgotten either -- 
they 
have a very high foreign policy profile and a lot of experience, 
in particular in the United Nations, regarding peacekeeping 
operations. This will benefit the European Union and the 
development of its own identity, especially in this field. 
[applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, the Federal Government on 15 March 
will 
go to Brussels with the firm will to achieve a breakthrough with 
Norway and a consensus on all other open questions. However, I 
would also like to say very clearly, calmly, and in a 
businesslike manner that its readiness for compromise hits its 
limits where the success of the referendums or the approval of 
the European Parliament are endangered. This would, for 
instance, be the case of the threshold for the blocking minority 
if the Council were to be put at such a low level that majority 
decisions would be made considerably more difficult. 
  On 15 March, we want to formally conclude the negotiations 
with all four countries and hope that all other partners will 
act in the same spirit. [applause] 
  Time is of the essence if we still want to maintain 1 
January 
1995 as the date of accession. Before the treaties can be 
signed, the European Parliament must approve them. From here, I 
also appeal to its deputies to take the political significance 
of the expansion into account and to deal speedily with the 
treaties, regardless of the forthcoming new elections and 
without any formalism. [applause] 
  I am sure -- and this also must be known and taken into 
account by the European Parliament -- that this is extremely 
important for the credibility of European policy, especially 
before the European elections on 12 June. [applause] 
  In addition to the approval of the European Parliament and 
the ratification of the membership treaties, a precondition for 
accession on 1 January 1995 is a positive result of the 
referendums in the would-be members. We should and must not 
forget that, and it should particularly be kept in mind by our 
partners during the talks on 15 March. 
  I am an optimist. The Nordic countries and Austria have 
weighed the matter carefully. They know their future lies in 
the European Union. They also know that they need not fear any 
loss of national characteristics and domestic way of life. The 
European Union stands for a Europe of variety, a Europe of the 
citizens and the regions. 
  I would like to expressly thank the German Bundestag for the 
constant support granted to the negotiating by the Federal 
Government. The awareness -- in particular, at such difficult 
negotiations, and they were and remain difficult -- that one is 
able to act on the basis of a broad political consensus means 
strength. I hope that the German Bundestag, which must agree to 
the membership treaties, will also do its part so that we can 
keep to the intended target date. It would be important for 
Europe and it would be important also for Germany. Therefore, 
we hope that the final breakthrough can be achieved on Tuesday. 
[applause]

<F P=106> [Article by Henrik Tuchsen: "Farmers Want Nordic EU </F>
Concessions Blocked"] 
  [Text] The Agricultural Council supports the admission of 
new European Union (EU) countries. But the Nordic colleagues 
will not be allowed to get away with special concessions and 
camouflaged trade barriers. 
  Danish farmers are now asking the Danish Government to block 
the special agricultural provisions that the other Nordic 
countries are requesting as part of their EU membership. 
  The negotiations on the admission of Sweden, Norway, and 
Finland have entered a decisive phase. They are scheduled to be 
completed by 1 March. But according to Danish farmers, an excess 
of special provisions and transition periods that are too long 
could shatter the big Danish expectations for the new export 
markets. 
  For this reason, according to a letter to Agriculture 
Minister Bjorn Westh (Social Democrat), the Agricultural Council 
supports the EU Commission's negotiating proposal, which is 
described as disappointing and unsatisfactory by the applicant 
countries, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria. 
  Danish farmers support full membership for the applicant 
countries. But according to Agricultural Council administrative 
director Klaus Bustrup, complying with the large number of 
demands, many of which the council regards as unrealistic and 
unacceptable, will mean that the countries will generally retain 
their present agricultural policies. This means high tariff 
barriers for food products, among other things. 
  With reference to the applicants' proposals to date, for 
example in the veterinary area, farmers warn against a lot of 
special concessions that are really camouflaged trade barriers. 
For example, the council points out that all demands from the 
applicant countries concerning border checks must be rejected as 
obvious trade barriers. 
  We noted that the council seems to be afraid of a lot of 
attempts to get provisions that are camouflaged trade barriers. 
  "Exactly, and that would not be fair. And we cannot accept 
special provisions of a general nature, for example allowing the 
countries to have some self-sufficiency goals, as they have now 
-- that is inconsistent with the whole idea of a common market," 
Bustrup said. 
  The applicant countries' adjustment to the EU's agricultural 
policies is a key problem in the admission negotiations; the 
southern European countries in particular have rejected giving 
agricultural concessions to the north European applicants. 
  It is quite clear from the letter to the agriculture 
minister 
that farmers consider the applicants' demands too unrealistic 
and unacceptable. This applies among other things to transition 
periods, quota allocations, and subsidy rights. 
  We asked how he thought the other Nordic countries will 
react 
when their Nordic colleagues support the strict course laid out 
by the EU Commission. 
  "Naturally we are writing to the minister in this phase of 
the negotiations, but I think we have also been quite aboveboard 
with respect to our Nordic colleagues," Bustrup said.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Lotte Henriksen, deputy chairman of the </F>
Social Democratic Party (SDP) Folketing group: "Denmark Places 
Great Emphasis on East European Aid"] 
  [Text] BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has devoted a lot of energy to 
discrediting Development Minister Helle Degn's credibility. The 
newspaper put a discussion of whether the minister was quoted 
correctly in connection with the selection of the Foreign 
Ministry's East European Aid Committee, which deals with 
technical and administrative aid, on the front page. A formality 
that suddenly became interesting. 
  However, the newspaper did not find it interesting a month 
earlier when the entire Folketing (with the exception of the 
Progress Party) agreed on the total substance during an 
interpellation concerning the whole future of East European aid. 
At any rate it was not on the front page or subsequent pages. 
That is a pity, for the interesting discussion was important. 
  People should take a stand on how East European aid is to be 
administered and prioritized in the future if only because of 
the large sums of money that are involved. More than 2 billion 
kroner has been set aside for East European aid in 1994, which 
corresponds to one-third of what is spent on aid in the rest of 
the world. 
  This money can be a good investment if it is used correctly. 
The money can help stabilize the budding democracies in the 
former communist countries, and reducing water and air pollution 
will also improve the Danish environment. At the same time, it 
is realized that there is reason to fear unrest and refugees 
from these countries unless we help them get off to a good start. 
  Denmark has something to contribute to this kind of good 
start in several areas: 
  In the environmental and energy sector Denmark is on the 
leading edge of development. We have good possibilities for the 
continued development of environmental technology and knowledge, 
and with a goal-oriented effort we could also help Danish firms 
to increase exports. 
  The government's new report on trade and industry points to 
the need to develop the welfare sector. Denmark has a lot of 
experience and expertise in this area that could be utilized to 
export systems. Among other things it mentions the possibility 
of exporting services to countries in East and Central Europe. A 
concrete positive example is systems exports in the gerontology 
area. 
  It is necessary to make a connection between expanding the 
social networks in the East European countries and building up a 
market economy. Just as an expanded commercial infrastructure is 
necessary to help the Danish commercial sector build up exports. 
In the future this will provide opportunities in energy, 
communications, and transportation projects, as well as housing 
and education projects. 
  The labor market is also relevant to systems exports. A 
solid 
labor market system contributes to political stability and firms 
that are already partly owned by western capital are demanding 
parity and cooperative organs. The Danish provisions for aid to 
the East should include conditions on good job environment and 
social safety net considerations. 
  This will counteract "social dumping" from the East, and at 
the same time, enable us to improve employment here at home by 
exporting services and welfare programs. 
  All this will be discussed in the weeks ahead by the East 
European Aid Committees that have been set up in several of the 
ministries. It will be debated by the Folketing spokesmen on 
East Europe and the minister in charge of the area.

<F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Ankara Challenges Russia on </F>
Azerbaijan"] 
  [Text] Turkey has categorically warned Russia that it 
cannot unilaterallly deploy troops in Azerbaijan. HURRIYET has 
ascertained that Bilgin Unan, deputy under secretary at the 
Turkish Foreign Ministry, informed Russian officials in Moscow 
last week that the peacekeeping force to be deployed in 
Azerbaijan must be established by international units. He said: 
"Russia cannot be the only country to deploy troops in 
Azerbaijan. Turkey will also deploy its troops if Russia sends 
its military forces to that republic." 
  Stressing that Turkey will accept no solution that will 
allow 
Armenian forces to be present in Azerbaijan, Unan reiterated 
Ankara's view that the solution must come within the framework 
of the CSCE Minsk Group's effort. Russian officials have 
insisted that their country's plan must also be effected in 
parallel with the Minsk Group's effort. Unan responded by 
saying that a comprehensive solution must be found to resolve 
the dispute. 
  According to the Turkish officials' impression, Russia will 
keep trying to impose Moscow's plan on the Baku administration. 
The plan calls for the deployment of Russia's troops in 
Azerbaijan. It has been ascertained that Ankara, considering 
the possibility of President Aliyev agreeing to Russia's plan, 
regards the Azerbaijani People's Front and former President 
Abulfaz Elchibey as a second force guaranteeing opposition in 
that republic to Moscow's intention.

Oscure [PDS headquarters] and Palazzo delle Aquile [Palermo's 
town hall]. Ferdinando Adornato, a journalist on REPUBBLICA and 
L'ESPRESSO and the AD's candidate in a safe constituency in 
Umbria, wants to be the one to choose the head of the 
progressives. 
  [De Marchis] So, who is the leader of the Left? 
  [Adornato] Spaventa, Spaventa. 
  [De Marchis] Another left-wing liberal: Whatever will the 
neocommunists have to say about that? They maintain that you 
want a constituent government as a favor to your political 
godfather, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. 
  [Adornato] I reject the idea of a constituent government out 
of hand. After the election there must be only two potential 
scenarios: Either a right-wing government with Berlusconi as 
prime minister or a left-wing government continuing the line 
pursued by the Ciampi government. 
  [De Marchis] And if the numbers are insufficient, it will 
mean another election, as Berlusconi proposes. Right? 
  [Adornato] Let us see what results the election brings 
before 
we say so. However, I take pleasure in reminding the Italians 
that, for the first time ever, they have the chance to choose 
the government directly. 
  [De Marchis] Then let us name the team. Do you already have 
some ministers in mind for the left-wing government? 
  [Adornato] At least four or five members of the Ciampi 
government should be reappointed, and let us not forget that we 
want to set up some new ministries. One for culture, for 
example. 
  [De Marchis] Berlusconi says that if you get into Palazzo 
Chigi [government seat], you will turn the country "into one big 
USL [local health unit]." 
  [Adornato] Slogan for slogan, I might retort that if he gets 
there he will turn the country into a drive-in. 
  [De Marchis] And if we leave the gibes aside? 
  [Adornato] The truth of the matter is that, thank God, none 
of the forces running in this election is fighting a statist 
platform. The USL's are the great metaphor for a deal between 
state-subsidized businesses and citizens involved in a 
back-scratching system. And Berlusconi was part of that system. 
And how! 
  [De Marchis] So what is your recipe for reconciling the 
market and the welfare state? 
  [Adornato] We must retain welfare mechanisms, not based on 
back scratching, for the weakest members of society; 
modernization must take account of the most vulnerable. To cite 
some examples, we must go for computerization ... 
  [De Marchis] Aha! That is a somewhat suspect point. You 
work for publishing companies controlled by Carlo De Benedetti, 
head of Olivetti. 
  [Adornato] But I want to favor no one. 
  [De Marchis] Sure? 
  [Adornato] I am sure. I did not like the deal between 
Olivetti and the unions... 
  [De Marchis] Le us move on. 
  [Adornato] We must improve relations between the education 
system and research, promote the tourist industry, and make the 
most of our cultural heritage, creating new jobs. 
  [De Marchis] Let us change the subject. A lot of 
ex-Socialists have found shelter in AD: Benvenuto, Cazzola, and 
Ruffolo, for instance. The UIL [Italian Federation of Trade 
Unions] is looking more and more like Democratic Alliance's 
battleship. Where is renewal to be found? Do these cumbersome 
facts not create discontent? 
  [Adornato] Ninety percent of our candidates have no previous 
experience in politics. However, I personally am no Jacobin as 
far as those who were in politics before are concerned. I do 
not ask, "where have you come from?" but, "where are you going?" 
  [De Marchis] Talking of where you are going, what will 
happen 
to Adornato if AD fails to make it across the 4 percent 
threshold? 
  [Adornato] It will merely mean that we shall pursue our 
goals 
in more difficult conditions. 
  [De Marchis] Perhaps it might have been better not to run in 
the proportional representation section? 
  [Adornato] It might have been an idea, but we decided to 
give 
it a try. 
  [De Marchis] And if it does not work out, will you be 
keeping 
your head down? 
  [Adornato] No. In the long run, ours will be the winning 
platform. In any case, even now ours is the only true alliance 
fighting this election.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Italian Northern League </F>
lower house floor leader, by Alberto Gentili; place and date not 
given: "The League Fires Berlusconi" -- first two paragraphs 
are IL MESSAGGERO introduction] 
  [Text] His close friends say that in his house in Gemonio, 
[Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi is having a big laugh. 
He is laughing over [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi who 
let himself "be led by the nose." He is laughing at the 
politicians and commentators who still believe in an alliance 
between the Northern League and Forza Italia and consider his 
intemperances as being the internal squabbles of the phantasmal 
"pole of freedoms." Nothing could be further from the truth. 
  For the Senator [Bossi nickname], the alliance with His 
Broadcastness [Berlusconi nickname] is already over. It lasted 
only one day. On 12 February when he officially shook hands 
with Berlusconi in Milan. The Northern League secretary wanted 
to keep the Knight's [Berlusconi nickname] candidates from 
entering the field in opposition to the Northern Leaguers in the 
uninominal constituencies. And this is what he got. He wanted 
to present "at least 280 Lombard people with excellent 
possibilities for success in the lower house and the Senate." 
And he succeeded. Since then he has one principal enemy: 
Berlusconi. And he demonstrates this in every way. He calls 
him a "Craxiano" and an "heir of the five-party coalition." He 
threatens that which is dearest to him: "his TV stations." He 
even denies him votes and orders the League members "not to 
support or present Forza Italia candidates." An unscrupulous 
game that has been revealed by Roberto Maroni, the Richelieu of 
the Bandwagon [League nickname], the man that concretely put 
down the electoral accord between Bossi and His Broadcastness in 
black and white. Let us listen to what he says. 
  [Gentili] Honorable Maroni, the pact with Berlusconi is over 
then? 
  [Maroni] It depends. Some are still thinking in terms of 
proportional representation. They think that everything works 
like it used to before, when electing candidates depended on the 
party organs. Now instead, with the majority system, any 
aspiring senator or representative must personally have the 
strength and credibility to get himself elected. 
  [Gentili] What does this mean? 
  [Maroni] That we will now see if our militants are right 
when 
they say: "The Christian Democrats put forward by Berlusconi 
will not be elected." Or if Forza Italia and the Christian 
Democrats of Mastella and Casini are right when they reply: "Do 
not run under the flags of the League and Forza Italia to be 
elected." 
  [Gentili] Who do you think is right? 
  [Maroni] Our militants. Moreover, we cannot force the League 
members to carry out an election campaign for a former Christian 
Democrat. 
  [Gentili] You are not even trying to. 
  [Maroni] You cannot ask for miracles. 
  [Gentili] Is it not instead because Bossi already considers 
the alliance with Forza Italia as finished? He has succeeded in 
keeping Berlusconi, his most dangerous rival, out of the North. 
And now he is saying: "Enemies like before." 
  [Maroni] I agree. It is more or less like this. 
  [Gentili] Bossi's was a masterly stroke. 
  [Maroni] Are you sure that such an astute maneuver was made 
by Bossi? 
  [Gentili] By whom then? 
  [Maroni] Think well. Somebody else who works with Bossi did 
this. 
  [Gentili] You? 
  [Maroni] Good. Do not make me say it. 
  [Gentili] Try to draw up a balance sheet. 
  [Maroni] We have reached our objective. We have succeeded in 
guaranteeing the League a very strong parliamentary 
representation which would not have been possible if we had set 
ourselves against Forza Italia. If everything goes as planned we 
should bring no less than 200 representatives to parliament. 
And this is a lot: triple the number we currently have. 
  [Gentili] And what is more, you have your hands free. 
  [Maroni] Right. And I will give you an example: How many 
chances does Berlusconi have of governing with the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left]? 
  [Gentili] You tell me. 
  [Maroni] Zero point something. While it is much more likely 
that the League will enter into an accord with an Occhetto 
government. We are a political animal whose objective is the 
realization of federalism. With anyone. 
  [Gentili] And, as you will maintain, you are no doubt closer 
to the federalism of the PDS than that of the MSI [Italian 
Social Movement]. Is this not so? 
  [Maroni] This is so. 
  [Gentili] So, do you confirm that the accord with Berlusconi 
is definitively over? 
  [Maroni] I would say that the only thing that remains 
standing is an electoral accord. 
  [Gentili] You forget that Bossi's election campaign is a 
revolt against Berlusconi rather than against Occhetto... 
  [Maroni] Berlusconi is taking care of the PDS. 
  [Gentili] For Bossi, who is a potential ally in government, 
[Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli or Occhetto? 
  [Maroni] Let us not exaggerate. The Knight for us is 
something more. We will first try to attain federalism with 
him. But if he says "no," or if he forges an alliance with the 
fascists [MSI], well then, we will consider ourselves free to 
look for other partners.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Northern League lower house </F>
floor leader, by Guido Passalacqua in Milan; date not given: 
"We Will Only Join Forces with Forza Italia If the Numbers Are 
Sufficient"] 
  [Text] Milan -- [Passalacqua] Deputy Maroni, what sort of 
government do you think will be formed after 28 March? An 
institutional government? 
  [Maroni] I believe so. We are open to all plausible options. 
It will all depend on the figures that emerge from the polling 
booths. [League Secretary] Bossi said so yesterday: "The 
League and Forza Italia will form a government on their own, if 
the numbers are sufficient." If, on the other hand, they are 
not, we will never join forces with [Italian Social Movement 
(MSI) Secretary] Fini, and therefore... 
  [Passalacqua] Therefore what? 
  [Maroni] I think that it is unlikely that the League and 
Forza Italia will obtain enough support to form a government on 
their own and, therefore, if we cannot do so with Fini, and we 
cannot form a government with the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left] or Communist Renewal either... then an institutional 
government may be the most viable option. 
  [Passalacqua] What do you mean "we cannot form a government 
with the PDS"? 
  [Maroni] Exactly what I said: We cannot form an organized 
government with the PDS. 
  [Passalacqua] Will the institutional government be similar 
to 
Ciampi's government? 
  [Maroni] Yes, I believe so. Personally speaking, I am 
against institutional governments. 
  [Passalacqua] It was you, however, who launched the idea 
during an interview with LA REPUBBLICA. 
  [Maroni] If need be, I will go ahead with such a government, 
but I will do so unwillingly, because I realize that it will be 
blocked by opposition vetoes. However, if the alternative is to 
hold new elections immediately, let us at least form this sort 
of government. 
  [Passalacqua] For what purpose? 
  [Maroni] Modifying the electoral law to make it 100 percent 
uninominal, reducing the number of deputies from 630 to 475. 
  [Passalacqua] Meaning? 
  [Maroni] If there is no choice but an institutional 
government, we must hold new elections, but not, say, just two 
months later. Let us do something positive, let us amend the 
electoral law by introducing a straight uninominal system for 
everybody, but getting rid of the proportional quota, which 
implies amending the Constitution. 
  [Passalacqua] What will happen then? 
  [Maroni] We must have everyone's support. 
  [Passalacqua] I have the feeling that the MSI and [Forza 
Italia leader] Berlusconi are not very much in favor of this 
formula. 
  [Maroni] If it is an institutional government, then it must 
enjoy everyone's support; otherwise, it is not an institutional 
government. Berlusconi and the MSI have said no, but it al 
depends on what such a government is called upon to do. If the 
prospect is holding elections with a straight uninominal system 
and voting directly for the prime minister, then everyone is 
agreed or can agree, in my opinion. 
  [Passalacqua] You seem to be neglecting federalism in your 
plans. 
  [Maroni] The MSI is light years away from this position. 
Forza Italia supports an important point which is that of 
fiscal federalism. This is not the full solution, but it is a 
first step. Federalism is not an instant process, the important 
thing is to get started. 
  [Passalacqua] What if the institutional government were only 
supported by the progressives? 
  [Maroni] It would no longer be an institutional government, 
but something different. When someone gets excluded, a 
political choice is being made. 
  [Passalacqua] What, however, if someone decides to exclude 
himself? 
  [Maroni] If that were to happen, I do not think that we 
could 
form an institutional government: It would be up to us and the 
Left. At that point, a left-wing minority government would be 
preferable. However, I must say that perhaps Berlusconi has not 
fully understood what an institutional government is. He is 
afraid that it might only mean a genuine executive power, with 
the PDS as part of it, governing the economy. An institutional 
government is something different. It is the expression of a 
parliament that decides to go back to the ballot boxes. 
  [Passalacqua] And, in the event of a left-wing minority 
government, what would the League then do? 
  [Maroni] It would be in the opposition. 
  [Passalacqua] Who should be the prime minister of an 
institutional government? 
  [Maroni] Not a politician, but someone guaranteeing the 
balance of forces. 
  [Passalacqua] Is this the only possibility that the League 
can envisage for the next parliament? 
  [Maroni] This is what I envisage in the event that the next 
parliament fails, that is, if we do not succeed in forming a 
League- Forza Italia majority. 
  [Passalacqua] If you do, who would be the prime minister? 
  [Maroni] Not me, I hope. It would be very hard on Italy -- I 
only really get going after midday. 
  [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi? The other day Bossi 
ruled him out... 
  [Maroni] As a matter of fact, he did. But we also believe 
that the people have the last word. 
  [Passalacqua] So we have to wait and see who wins in the 
proportional round? 
  [Maroni] Something along those lines. 
  [Passalacqua] It seems clear enough: Berlusconi will win. 
  [Maroni] Not necessarily. You are thinking in terms of 
national percentages, we think in terms of geographical areas. 
If the League wins the first place in the north, this will 
carry some weight. 
  [Passalacqua] What is the state of your current relations 
with Berlusconi? 
  [Maroni] Well, I am in charge of relations with Berlusconi, 
and they are good. 
  [Passalacqua] You always seem to be squabbling, though... 
  [Maroni] My relationship with him is good, although he is 
worried about these differences because he thinks they may cause 
us to lose votes. 
  [Passalacqua] Will you still stay together after the 
elections? 
  [Maroni] I think so.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Republican Party Secretary Giorgio </F>
La Malfa by Edoardo Segantini; place and date not given: 
"Government Adrift Without the Center" -- first two paragraphs 
are L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- Thanks partly to people such as his father, 
Ugo La Malfa, who in the fifties fought for the opening of the 
frontiers against the left-wing opposition, Italy has not sunk 
further into decline. Fortebraccio, the legendary L'UNITA 
commentator, dubbed La Malfa senior "the Fernet [Branca, bitter 
digestive drink] of Italian politics." A caustic, brilliant, 
prophetic, impenitent, suspicious, and rather bothersome 
nonconfessional -- more than a Fernet, rather a drop of 
Angostura bitters that made the very indigestible cocktail of 
the First Republic less impossible to drink. The old man led a 
force that was numerically insignificant but of noble quality, 
using his huge personal charisma. 
  Giorgio La Malfa resembles his father physically, but lacks 
his stature. Recent judicial developments have damaged his 
political image, without harming his personal image of 
unquestionable honesty. His return from a year's exile, spent 
partly in Rome and partly at his seaside house at Capalbio, was 
not exactly a major event. His decision to transfer to the 
center of Italian Popular Party [PPI] Secretary Martinazzoli and 
[Pact for Italy leader] Segni split the Italian Republican Party 
[PRI], which is now clinging to Occhetto's Democratic Party of 
the Left [PDS], with the little party's "grands bourgeois," from 
Visentini to Ayala, in the role of the progressive front's 
elders. 
  [Segantini] You declared total war on your friends who sided 
with the progressive forces. And now you find yourself alone at 
the helm. 
  [La Malfa] I am not waging war on anyone. I merely asked the 
national court of arbitration to rule on a matter of discipline. 
A party's orientation is binding on everyone. When some 
members, however authoritative, decide otherwise, the secretary 
has no choice but to report a possible violation. 
  [Segantini] But how did this split come about? 
  [La Malfa] We proceeded from a shared analysis but reached 
different conclusions. The starting point was anxiety over the 
growth and danger of the right in Italy, which both I and 
Visentini consider a very major threat. But although this is 
our diagnosis, it does not make sense to force center political 
forces to adopt a left-wing stance, casting them into the 
embrace of the PDS, Communist Renewal, or the Rete. 
  [Segantini] In what way is the right dangerous, in view of 
the fact that not even [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema is worried 
about it? On the one hand, we have two forces citing 
liberal-democratic values, albeit differently -- the Northern 
League and Forza Italia. On the other hand, we have an alliance 
-- i.e., [leader of the National Alliance and secretary of the 
Italian Social Movement, MSI] Fini's -- that declares itself to 
be closer to [French Rally for the Republic leader] Chirac than 
to [French National Front leader] Le Pen. What does this mean? 
  [La Malfa] Of the three right-wing components, the one with 
which I would like to succeed in conducting a dialogue is the 
Northern League. Leaving aside his language, which I do not 
like, I did establish political relations with [Northern League 
Secretary] Bossi at a time when no one wanted to have anything 
to do with him. And I have never changed my opinion -- that the 
League represents a liberal protest in a country that very much 
needs it. Both its appeal for decentralization and its appeal 
for a protest against the tax system are legitimate and just 
forms of protest against an excessively oppressive state. 
  [Segantini] What about the National Alliance? 
  [La Malfa] I have formed a negative assessment of it. It has 
made no real revision of the past. Fini has merely said that 
fascism is dead. But that coroner's report is not enough. 
  [Segantini] Unless I am mistaken, you do not seem equally 
strict in putting Occhetto to the democratic test. 
  [La Malfa] That is different. Occhetto has behind him a 
lengthy process of deliberation which began with [former 
Communist Party leader] Berlinguer, the split that produced 
Communist Renewal, and a clear verdict on the harm done by 
communism in the Soviet Union. These assessments clearly 
condemn the communist phenomenon... 
  [Segantini] But it would have been very difficult not to 
express those assessments. 
  [La Malfa] Yes, yes, of course, and indeed that explains my 
cautiousness in my relations with the left. But if I am 
assessing democratic reliability, the PDS has no problems from 
this viewpoint. The real trouble with the PDS is its doubtful 
ability to govern a Western country in such a way as to 
encourage the market forces. 
  [Segantini] But in the event of a victory by the right, do 
you really think that the National Alliance will have a major 
role to play? 
  [La Malfa] Well, this is the crucial issue in the election 
debate. Both Occhetto and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, but 
above all Bossi, are giving us to understand that they had to 
form electoral alliances with groups with which they disagree 
politically, that is, the communists and fascists. They imply 
that after the elections these latter forces will go into 
opposition. My question is this: With whom will you form a 
majority, the majority that would enable you to consign them to 
the opposition? 
  [Segantini] And so? 
  [La Malfa] Both moderate components of the two alignments 
presuppose the existence of a center; they need an interlocutor. 
But unless there is a center, a third stance that will permit 
the division of the two electoral alignments and the orientation 
of the extremes in the opposition, Italy will have a Fini or 
[Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti government. So we risk 
having as prime minister representatives of an old communist 
tradition that would prompt an outflow of capital or a right 
that would be dangerous because of domestic or international 
consequences. 
  [Segantini] What is dangerous about Forza Italia? Are they 
subversive, too? 
  [La Malfa] Berlusconi is the proof that everyone should deal 
with their own business. 
  [Segantini] Let the voters decide... 
  [La Malfa] I am sure that his entry into politics will 
increase Italy's problems rather than resolve them. This, 
because the left- right polarization is a good thing, but only 
if it does not cause the extremes to prevail. 
  [Segantini] But Forza Italia's proposals seem a long way 
from 
any kind of extremism. 
  [La Malfa] The fiscal part is demagogic, and the rest is 
characterized by common sense. The problem is a political one: 
If Berlusconi had formed his alliance with the League and 
isolated the MSI on the right, that would indeed have made sense. 
  [Segantini] But if the center does emerge strong from the 
elections, with whom will you ally? 
  [La Malfa] Look, with the first-past-the-post system, this 
question cannot be answered. Under the new rules, the aim is to 
achieve an absolute majority. If none of the groupings achieves 
a majority, the president will probably establish a provisional 
government with the task of completing the transformation of the 
electoral mechanism. 
  [Segantini] That is, a short-lived government with an 
institutional mission. 
  [La Malfa] It would, however, have a limitation -- the same 
one that affected the Ciampi government. Namely, that a 
government without a real majority cannot engage in politics. 
  [Segantini] Could you see [Senate speaker] Spadolini 
performing such a task? 
  [La Malfa] I find it embarrassing to say so, since he is a 
member of my party, but obviously I would be pleased. 
  [Segantini] Is it true that [Fiat President] Mr. Agnelli's 
position influenced your decision to opt for the center? 
  [La Malfa] I have not met with Mr. Agnelli for several 
months. Be that as it may, I hope that this political 
orientation will be appreciated by the sector of the business 
world that pays most attention to the other Western countries' 
assessments of us. 
  [Segantini] What is your opinion of Italy's major 
entrepreneurs? 
  [La Malfa] Italy's tragedy is that we have no major 
industry. 
This is because the Catholic world and the left, and sometimes 
even the League, are opposed to big business; they regard it as 
harmful in some way. Growing up in an unfavorable environment, 
our industries have faced greater difficulties than their 
foreign competitors. 
  [Segantini] Do you not think that the various Agnellis and 
De 
Benedettis have also made mistakes in the management of their 
enterprises, despite the major aid received from the state? 
  [La Malfa] Well, if they have made mistakes, they are now 
starting to pay for them too. Look at the Feruzzis: Their sad 
fate is a punishment decreed by the market. And they are not 
the only ones. Things have changed for Fiat too, with the 
latest increase in capital, albeit rather neatly: The family's 
influence has diminished in favor of that of the banks. 
  [Segantini] But you are now in danger of proving to be your 
own party's liquidator. 
  [La Malfa] You have no idea of the efforts that I made to 
persuade Visentini, Gualtieri, and Giovanni Ferrara not to break 
our unity. But it was all in vain. 
  [Segantini] Are you not afraid of being sidelined by a 
Martinazzoli-Occhetto axis? 
  [La Malfa] As I have already said, I believe that the next 
legislature will be a brief one, devoted to completing the 
electoral reform. After that there will be another election. 
It is to be hoped that something will be done to make the 
executive more stable, and I am in favor of the direct election 
of the prime minister. In order to carry out these reforms, it 
is likely that a government ranging from the League to the PDS 
will be formed.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Giovanni Minoli; place and date not given; from the "Mixer" 
program -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Minoli] Well, Mr. Fini do you consider it to be 
a compliment or an insult to be called a fascist by Umberto 
Bossi? 
  [Fini] I am indifferent to what Bossi says about me. It 
almost makes me want to laugh. 
  [Minoli] Why? 
  [Fini] Bossi is a very strange character and his extreme 
envy 
has been demonstrated. [passage omitted] He tried to get votes 
from the south, those votes which he now despises so much, but 
the south sent him back to the valleys. 
  [Minoli] You said that Bossi reminded you of Hitler trapped 
in his Berlin bunker, a man with delusions of grandeur and a 
tendency towards suicide. Are you joking, he is an ally after 
all. 
  [Fini] No, I am not an ally of Bossi. 
  [Minoli] But this a serious accusation. 
  [Fini] Yes it is, but it was also a form of revenge for me, 
because he is always calling me a fascist [passage omitted]. I 
am not in alliance with Bossi. 
  [Minoli] What is Bossi's worst defect? 
  [Fini] Well I think that he is too convinced of the 
possibility of obtaining votes by shouting, and he shouts in 
many circumstances and so he appears inadequate in his role. 
  [Minoli] Is there anything that you envy in Umberto Bossi? 
  [Fini] Not particularly. Certainly, some time ago I used to 
envy his votes, but not now because I will obtain more votes 
than him. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] What effect does Bossi telling his supporters not 
to 
vote for Silvio Berlusconi have on you as an ally? 
  [Fini] But as I have said for the hundredth time I am not an 
ally of Bossi. [passage omitted] I am not an ally of Bossi 
because no one could make an alliance with Bossi over two 
fundamental questions: identity and solidarity. I believe that 
this is embarrassing to Berlusconi -- Bossi's hostility is 
embarrassing. Bossi set up the Freedom Alliance not because he 
believed in it, but because he found that it was necessary to do 
so. 
  [Minoli] Do you think that this continual exchange of 
insults 
is advantageous to the common cause? 
  [Fini] It is advantageous because whoever listens does not 
vote for Occhetto [leader of the Democratic Party of the Left]. 
Perhaps he will vote for Fini. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] If you win, you say: no government with Bossi, but 
each one for himself. 
  [Fini] I do not demonize anybody. If Bossi... 
  [Minoli] I want a precise answer. If Bossi were fundamental 
in order for your alliance to govern... 
  [Fini] He must accept two questions which for us are more 
fundamental than government: national unity and solidarity 
between the north and the south. [passage omitted] I believe 
that until 1938 fascism was useful for Italy, not good or bad, 
but useful. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] Do you still believe that Benito Mussolini is still 
the greatest statesman of the 20th century? 
  [Fini] In Italy certainly, without a shadow of a doubt. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] You said; I am not a racist. Racism is an authentic 
evil. However, you said that all forms of begging must be 
suppressed. Who are these beggars? 
  [Fini] A beggar is not necessarily somebody whose skin is a 
different color. Begging is a crime which must be punished in 
some way. I do not believe that Italians like being disturbed 
in certain circumstances. However, there is absolutely nothing 
racist in my opinion. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] Do you believe in the death penalty? 
  [Fini] We have gone beyond this question. We used to ask 
that an article of the military peacetime code which made 
provision for the death penalty be applied. Today we no longer 
ask for this, because that article has been abolished. 
  [Minoli] So you do not believe in the death penalty? 
  [Fini] No, I would be never be the one to push the button or 
pull the lever. It is matter of conscience. 
  [Minoli] Do you believe in God? 
  [Fini] Of course. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] Do you really believe that as Berlusconi says there 
is a communist threat? 
  [Fini] Yes, there is a danger represented by the Left. 
[passage omitted] Myself and Silvio Berlusconi both consider 
Achille Occhetto an enemy to be defeated. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] In a few words, what does it mean to be right-wing 
today? 
  [Fini] It means having a nonmaterial view of life. It means 
having a conception of a fully functioning state which 
guarantees rights and fulfills its duties. It means having an 
idea of nationhood under which all those who live in a certain 
territory are governed by one state. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] Berlusconi is an ardent supporter of the free 
market. Is there not a true fundamental incompatibility on the 
subject of principles and values? 
  [Fini] No, there is no incompatibility. Berlusconi is 
certainly a supporter of the free market. I believe that the 
free market is indispensable, but that it should be equal, and 
therefore a market which makes guarantees for small and 
medium-sized businessmen. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] Have you spoken to Silvio Berlusconi about this? 
  [Fini] We have not spoken about the issue concerning the 
workings of the free market. I believe that he must explain to 
me why he does not agree with me on this point. 
  [Minoli] Here on the "Mixer" program, Umberto Bossi said 
that 
the anti-trust laws which he had in mind would kill Fininvest. 
Do you have any plans for passing anti-trust laws? 
  [Fini] No, I am not convinced that we need such laws. 
However, I do believe that it is necessary to review the system 
of television ownership in this country - both public and 
private. [passage omitted] Above all it is important that both 
private and public sector television are on an equal footing. 
RAI has two elements compared to the private sector which make 
it stand out. It has an income from the television license, and 
if RAI closes its books in the red then the state intervenes... 
  [Minoli, interrupting] Yes but they are re-organizing RAI... 
  [Fini] It's an easy enough thing to do with our money. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] So you do not believe in the privatization of RAI? 
  [Fini] Not at all; otherwise we would merely have a private 
television system. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] What do you like most about Silvio Berlusconi? 
  [Fini] His sincerity because he is the type of person who 
makes his feelings clear. I also think that he is successful 
because in the past politics was all too often incomprehensible, 
and he speaks about politics in a clear way. 
  [Minoli] What do you like about him the least? 
  [Fini] The fact that he is convinced that he is the center 
of 
the political universe. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] What are your defects? 
  [Fini] I have many defects. Sometimes I do not ask for my 
rights strongly enough. [passage omitted] I have never called 
you up asking you why you have never invited me on your show. 
  [Minoli] From a personal point of view, what is your worse 
defect? 
  [Fini] Sometimes I am unable to express my feelings in some 
circumstances. However, I do have feelings. 
  [Minoli] Do you think that Berlusconi is the Freedom 
Alliance's candidate for the post of prime minister? 
  [Fini] We must let the electors decide. By voting the 
electors decide what the make-up at the center of any given 
slate is. [passage omitted] I believe that Berlusconi has the 
capability to assume the role of president. 
  [Minoli] Do you want this? 
  [Fini] Let the electorate decide this. If the voters give me 
more votes than Berlusconi, then why should I hold back? 
  [Minoli] Then you will be standing for president? 
  [Fini] No, I am not standing for the post. Let the electors 
decide. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] Bossi said that he had formed an alliance with 
Berlusconi in order to pry him away from Segni and Martinazzoli, 
and also because he owns television stations. Why did you form 
an alliance with Berlusconi? 
  [Fini] Above all because under a first-past-the-post voting 
system one cannot waste time or energy. Not allying ourselves 
with Berlusconi would have meant starting at a disadvantage. 
[passage omitted] Forming an alliance with Berlusconi was a 
political necessity. The system of proportional representation 
no longer exists. Our alliance has become firmer because we 
have points in common. 
  [Minoli] Do you consider the alliance to be a marriage of 
love or convenience? 
  [Fini] Neither one nor the other. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] Do you believe in the idea of politics as a form of 
marketing? Do you think that this is a step backwards or 
forwards? 
  [Fini] I think that it is a tremendous step backwards. There 
will be trouble if politics becomes a sort of market where one 
trades what is in front of him. Politics is, above all, about 
planning, it must be based on certain values and it must be a 
concrete response to the problems of the people. 
  [Minoli] After the elections, what do you think must be done 
about the Tangentopoli scandal? 
  [Fini] The first thing that I would do is to make the guilty 
pay back every single lira that they stole. [passage omitted] 
There are many people who would prefer to see them poor but free 
rather than in prison for three months and millionaires. When 
Tangentopoli is over we must rehabilitate those in power. At 
present only the power of the judiciary is considered by the 
Italian people to be credible. [passage omitted] 
  [Minoli] I will ask you a final question. Do you really 
think that following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 
reunification of Germany, Italy should claim back Istra, Pula, 
and Dalmatia as you have proposed? 
  [Fini] I did not say this. What I said, and I will repeat 
this, let us not forget that those are Italian lands, in the 
same way as Japan does not forget the Kuril Islands. 
  [Minoli] Not only does it not forget them, in the long term 
it wants them back. 
  [Fini] Yes, but only by means of a treaty, by using 
diplomatic means and by reaching an agreement with the other 
country concerned which in this case is Russia. 
  [Minoli] In other words we are not going to war to get them 
back. 
  [Fini] Not at all. We will never go to war to get these 
lands back. Furthermore I will say something else. Let us be 
careful before we send our soldiers to the former Yugoslavia. 
  [Minoli] Do you agree with this? 
  [Fini] It must be clear that all those who are shooting at 
each other in the former Yugoslavia appreciate the presence of 
Italian soldiers in the country. If there is just one faction 
which says; we do not want the Italians, then it is better that 
the Italians stay at home.
