<F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F>
Michael Kadereit in Arcore; date not given: "Berlusconi: I Had 
To Intervene Myself"] 
  [Excerpts] [Kadereit] What drove you into politics? 
  [Berlusconi] The only important thing was my country. A 
great change has taken place here; as a result of the corruption 
scandals, the old political class has disappeared. After the 
Left won the local elections in December and no opposition 
formed, I felt compelled to intervene myself to fulfill 
Italians' desire for a new political power. [passage omitted] 
  [Kadereit] But what do you, an entrepreneur, want to achieve 
in politics? 
  [Berlusconi] We want to lead this country out of the state 
of real socialism in which it is still ensconced.... 
  [Kadereit] But here the Christian Democrats were in power? 
  [Berlusconi] We want the state to have less say in the 
economy. 
  [Kadereit] You call the 45-point program of your Forza 
Italia "absolutely liberalistic." What does that mean? 
  [Berlusconi] We believe in freedom, the individual, family, 
tolerance, and, of course, in competition and free market 
economy, that is, the values of the large European democracies. 
  [Kadereit] But in southern Italy you have concluded an 
election alliance with the extreme right... 
  [Berlusconi] The political and economic program of Alleanza 
Nazionale is absolutely liberal. I take any bet on that. 
  [Kadereit] How compatible is a liberal program with the 
great concentration of power in your hand -- industry, media, 
now also political power? In other countries your appearance 
has certainly given rise to some concern. 
  [Berlusconi] Other countries have a completely distorted 
picture of Forza Italia and of me. The majority of Italian 
correspondents abroad are part of a group that is fighting under 
the flag of the communists. 
  You see, the idea that I would use my media for my own 
purposes as a politician is completely wrong. Without having 
any law tell me to do so, I have resigned from all functions 
within my Fininvest group. I am only the president of my soccer 
club AC Milan. 
  [Kadereit] But your are still the sole owner of Fininvest. 
  [Berlusconi] I tell you one thing: If I become prime 
minister I will, of course, keep far away from all decisions 
that might directly or indirectly affect my industrial group. 
And all Italians will have the opportunity to examine my 
behavior. 
  [Kadereit] This sounds as if you expected to get the highest 
government office? 
  [Berlusconi] The latest polls show that I predicted 
correctly that there is a desire for change. Forza Italia keeps 
rising in the polls. Italians believe in an entrepreneur like 
myself, who has worked in many sectors and founded companies 
everywhere, which became number one. According to the polls, I 
am by far the most appreciated politician. Asked "Do you trust 
Silvio Berlusconi?" 61.3 percent of the Italians say yes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, secretary of the </F>
Democratic Party of the Left, by unidentified foreign 
correspondents in Rome on 16 March: "I Do Not Want To Burn 
Either My Wings or Those of Ciampi"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] The war in 
Yugoslavia is closer to Rome than it is to Milan. Why do you 
talk so little about it? 
  [Occhetto] This is not true; we do talk about it. Italy's 
commitment was a fervid one and this is demonstrated by the 
victims of our information industry, to whom my thoughts go out. 
The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] also declared itself in 
favor of the participation of the Italian blue berets in an 
international operation, precisely because of the exceptional 
nature of the situation and because of the need to strengthen 
and stabilize the truce. The condition being the request of the 
UN secretary general and the consensus of all the sides 
involved. I also recall that since we were at NATO precisely 
when the first air attack was launched, I stated that I agreed 
with the action. I only manifested concern over a possible 
counterstroke by the Russians. We continue to consider the 
mediation initiated by Moscow as being decisive in order to go 
ahead. 
  [Correspondent] The Right still accuses you of being 
Bolsheviks, responsible for revolutionary crimes, and at the 
same time of not having offered any clear opposition to the 
kickback scandal... 
  [Occhetto] There is in effect a contradiction here. I will 
let the historians judge our "Bolshevism." [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi is the only one in Europe to talk of a 
"communist danger" in Italy... There could be some truth in the 
second accusation. During the laborious construction of Italian 
democracy there were cases of associationism, some were 
virtuous, others were not. The latter wet the wings of our 
capacity to act as an opposition, also because our political 
system was blocked. The PDS was born precisely in order to 
overcome the heart of this situation, by criticizing the system 
of straight proportional representation and fighting for a 
system of alternatives in which all the citizens can make a 
decision on the government and the prime minister. 
  [Correspondent] What will happen in Italy if the Right wins? 
Or if nobody wins: How can a government be guaranteed? 
  [Occhetto] I see a straight-out victory of Berlusconi 
leading 
him to the seat of prime minister as being difficult. 
Berlusconi himself knows, as I know, that the electoral tests 
are not positive for Forza Italia, so much so that he has 
started to talk of an institutional or constituent government. 
In any case, I hope that the progressives will be the central 
force, around which a solution can be built. Every day brings a 
new problem though and we will think about this after the 
elections. 
  [Correspondent] Is there really a "diversity" between the 
PDS 
and the progressives on the moral issue? 
  [Occhetto] We have never spoken of an "anthropological" 
diversity. But our reaction was different. With great 
frankness and honesty we apologized to the Italians and for a 
lot less than what the others did. And the trials will end up 
showing that we had no connection with the kickback scandal, a 
system that involved not only the politicians but also corrupt 
businessmen who distorted the market. We then supported the 
meritorious work of justice, even though there may have been 
excesses or errors. For 11 months we were nailed down by the 
episode of a single Swiss bank account that was not ours. One 
of our members was arrested and then freed by the court. We 
bore the series of difficulties in a Christian spirit. The most 
important task is really to clean things up. 
  [Correspondent] If the progressive pole wins, will you be 
the 
future prime minister? 
  [Occhetto] The victory of the progressives will bring with 
it 
the problem of presenting a prime minister and a team. It will 
have to be resolved with great wisdom, and with the attention 
focused on creating a climate of security, certainty, and 
tranquillity. There is no need to propose candidates now. Laws 
that do not exist should not be mimicked, like the election of 
the prime minister. I will not be involved in drawing-room 
games with people throwing themselves off the tower. What sense 
is there in saying "I will candidate myself"? Or to candidate 
[Prime Minister] Ciampi who said -- and did well to say so -- 
that he wants to remain above the fray? I have affirmed from 
the beginning that Ciampi remains a resource for our democracy. 
Proposing him now could mean damaging him. And I do not want 
to burn either Occhetto's or Ciampi's wings... 
  [Correspondent] Do you consider yourself to be a better 
social democrat than your adversaries? 
  [Occhetto] It does not take much to be more of a liberal 
democrat than Berlusconi. And I come from Turin, the city of 
Gramsci and Gobetti. Stalin is not part of my training. When I 
came up against him, of course not personally, I fought him, 
asking for the reinstatement of Luxemburg and Trotsky in "Nuova 
Generazione." I must say that Togliatti let me do as I pleased, 
he was fundamentally more "liberal" than people thought. 
Berlusconi is a liberal democrat who seems to have problems 
with the United Kingdom. It was in this very room that he got 
upset with a British journalist who reminded him of his 
television monopoly. He was to have appeared on "Milano Italia" 
[third channel TV program], but then said no when he heard that 
another British journalist was going to be there. The terror of 
the "perfidious Albion" was nourished by only one other person 
in Italy... 
  [Correspondent] Rete and Communist Renewal have different 
positions on Ciampi, treasury bills, and NATO. How will the 
progressives explain this overseas? 
  [Occhetto] I think that propaganda is of little interest 
overseas. The treasury bills issue has been built up. Even 
economists like Monti and Martino agree with [Communist Renewal 
Secretary] Bertinotti's thesis, which is not like speaking badly 
of the Madonna. We consider it wrong not as a matter of 
principle, but because realism tells us that this is not the 
path to take in order to fight the government deficit. I have 
reason to believe that, if we get elected, Communist Renewal 
would accept what was agreed upon at the progressive table. At 
NATO I had the feeling that no general considered Bertinotti's 
hypothesis of having Italy withdraw from the alliance as being 
realistic. 
  [Correspondent] Would the Left be responsible for a possible 
advancement of the Right in Italy? And would you govern with 
Berlusconi? 
  [Occhetto] The League has advanced in the north because we 
did not always do our duty. We should have broken up the town 
council alliances with [former Socialist leader] Craxi before. 
However, the real cause behind the growth toward the Right is 
the disintegration of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and 
its old system of power. After the victory of the progressive 
mayors it was natural for the Right to reorganize itself. But 
instead of a modern and civil Right, a worrying, ideological 
force has entered into the field. Even for this reason I rule 
out any government with Berlusconi. I think that the 
progressives will get the majority, and will present their 
government proposal to the president of the republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Nicola Mancino by Giuseppe </F>
D'Avanzo; place and date not given : "Even the Mafia Has its 
Candidates"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [D'Avanzo] Is the 
center growing? 
  [Mancino] Yes, and it does not surprise me. The center is 
the only grouping that can offer the voters a homogeneous and 
solid program line. This is certainly an advantage with respect 
to the inconsistencies of the Right and the Left. You cannot 
stop in front of a door marked "Electoral Coalition." People 
want to know with whom and how it is intended to govern. Both 
the Right and the Left have little to say about this. They have 
made too many mistakes. 
  [D'Avanzo] Too many mistakes. What are they? 
  [Mancino] On the Left, Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic 
Party of the Left, PDS] has committed a very serious strategic 
error. He decided to embrace within his coalition -- for the 
sake of exclusively numerical necessities -- a party that has 
not abandoned its plan to reestablish communism in Italy and 
that proclaims to the four winds that, although the Soviet 
system made some fundamental mistakes, the nature, the Marxist 
framework of its social order must still be defended. 
  [D'Avanzo] So what is his strategic error? 
  [Mancino] That is soon said. The attempt at an upward social 
leveling has failed in every corner of Central and West Europe. 
The raising of the weaker social classes to a higher level is 
part of a culture that our country cannot accept. 
  [D'Avanzo] So much for the Left. What are the Right's 
mistakes? 
  [Mancino] However many efforts [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi may make, it remains clear that the MSI [Italian 
Social Movement], even in the new form of the National Alliance, 
cannot coexist with the League in government, even disregarding 
the conflict that exists between the former's specific appeal 
for the country's unity and the latter's calls for federalism. 
If you look at the programs of the Right, you will find them 
full of demagogy. It will not be easy for those gentlemen to 
govern. 
  [D'Avanzo] In the conflict between [Northern League leader] 
Bossi and Berlusconi, the smarter one seems to be Bossi, who has 
made his calculations on the basis of individual constituencies, 
not on the basis of opinion polls. He can now say: Of the 320 
constituencies in the north, 200 will be mine. 
  [Mancino] Yes, Bossi certainly is the smarter one. He is 
trying to overcome the irritation of coexisting with Berlusconi, 
the loss of territorial hegemony. Bossi is certainly more 
strategic, Berlusconi more tactical. 
  [D'Avanzo] But Berlusconi has no doubts about victory. 
  [Mancino] I would not be so sure, if I were in his shoes. 
The country has to decide whether a gentleman who owns a large 
proportion of the television stations, newspapers, and sectors 
of production can be impartial when it comes to deciding what 
kinds of economic measures Italy needs. I think that the 
Italian people are intelligent and that they will seek a third 
person who is able to manage the country's interests, not his 
own interests. 
  [D'Avanzo] However, this third option, the center, does not 
seem to be playing a prominent part in this election campaign at 
all. 
  [Mancino] The campaign is taking place with a deliberate 
understanding between two antagonists: The Left shouts about 
the danger of a swing toward authoritarianism, while the Right 
shouts out in fright about a left-wing government. But who 
believes in this split between two poles? It is a distorted 
arrangement that after the elections will have to relinquish its 
extreme wings in order to be able to govern. That is when it 
will be necessary to take account of the center. 
  [D'Avanzo] How many seats will the center have in 
parliament? 
  [Mancino] I am no soothsayer. What I do say is that if the 
numbers so permit, we will govern; if not, we will go into 
opposition. 
  [D'Avanzo] With whom would you govern? 
  [Mancino] If an intermediate constituent phase were to prove 
necessary, we would do our part. 
  [D'Avanzo] On what conditions? 
  [Mancino] On condition that the two poles separate at each 
extreme in order to agree on a program including institutional 
reform. 
  [D'Avanzo] With Ciampi as prime minister? 
  [Mancino] Although everyone judged him merely a technocrat, 
Ciampi has shown himself to be a shrewd and responsible 
politician. Having worked with him, I can say that he has not 
shown himself to be exclusively concerned with pursuing a merely 
monetarist policy. 
  [D'Avanzo] It is very likely that you will be the last 
Christian Democrat minister to occupy your present post for a 
long time... 
  [Mancino] If that does happen, I do not think that anyone 
would be distressed, neither I nor my party. 
  [D'Avanzo] So perhaps we could take stock calmly of the 
damage done by the DC [Christian Democratic Party] at the 
Interior Ministry. 
  [Mancino] I am willing to take stock of the damage done, if 
we also mention the good points... 
  [D'Avanzo] For instance... 
  [Mancino] To have consolidated democracy in the country at a 
time when there was a rifle in every home. 
  [D'Avanzo] Very well, and what about the demerits? 
  [Mancino] Neglect of the increasing growth of organized 
crime. We failed to see in time that the Mafia was turning into 
a holding company. 
  [D'Avanzo] Do you not think that it is insufficient to talk 
in terms of neglect, in view of the fact that one former 
minister, Gava, is accused of associating with the Mafia and a 
former prime minister, Andreotti, is accused of homicide and 
Mafia activities? 
  [Mancino] If you think that neglect of such dangerous 
phenomena is a small matter... 
  [D'Avanzo] In other words, you do not believe in [Mafia 
boss] 
Riina's kiss. 
  [Mancino] No, I do not. 
  [D'Avanzo] Minister, Sisde... 
  [Mancino] I will not discuss Sisde. I have done nothing else 
for the past five months. That is enough, I am tired of it. 
Misinformation obscures everything. I am accused of having 
failed to carry out checks. What was I supposed to do? Was I 
supposed to monitor things even before I became minister? When 
I did become minister I brought back 14 billion lire to Sisde's 
treasury, in accordance with the method determined by a judge. 
I immediately informed the prime minister, Giulio Andreotti, 
and a fortnight later [Sisde chief] Malpica was dismissed. 
  [D'Avanzo] But you are accused of having organized the 
shelving of the inquiry... 
  [Mancino] That is untrue. The truth is that Malpica boasted 
to his accomplices of my help and who knows what else. There 
was no such help, nor could there have been. 
  [D'Avanzo] Malpica talks about certain meetings... 
  [Mancino] No. When confronted by other witnesses, Malpica 
withdrew his statements about a meeting at the Quirinale Palace 
[president's office], a meeting at the Foreign Ministry, and a 
meeting with [police chief] Vincenzo Parisi. All that remained 
was a telephone call. Well, that telephone call did take place. 
I told Malpica to do what he thought right... 
  [D'Avanzo] [former Sisde chief] Broccoletti's defense 
attorney Marazzita, told CORRIERE DELLA SERA: "The fact that 
Mancino took 100 million lire a month is probably consistent 
with his personality..." 
  [Mancino] What kind of answer do you expect me to give to 
this Marazzita, who agreed to do a few little jobs for [former 
Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi? Even though he sent 
me a telegram of apology, I have already instructed my lawyers 
to defend my honor... 
  [D'Avanzo] Are you suing him? 
  [Mancino] That is not decided. Maybe I will demand a billion 
lire in damages from him. That will teach him how to act as an 
attorney. 
  [D'Avanzo] Nevertheless, the Sisde trial... 
  [Mancino] I do not want to talk any more about Sisde... I do 
not feel like the interior minister; I feel like a politician, 
and I want to engage in politics again... When I came here the 
situation was disastrous. Falcone had been killed, and 
immediately afterward the Mafia killed Borsellino [both judges] 
too. We were in disarray. Since then we have succeeded in 
setting matters in order again. I will not now repeat things 
and statistics which everyone should remember. The wanted 
persons arrested, the operations, the arrests, the 
investigations... 
  [D'Avanzo] On the subject of the Mafia, Occhetto has issued 
a 
warning: They are threatening the trade unions. Is the Mafia 
still active, despite its defeats? 
  [Mancino] When you build something new, it is no surprise 
when the old returns to life, violently. The Mafia does exist, 
and it will continue to play a leading role now too by 
guaranteeing support to certain political groups. 
  [D'Avanzo] Which? 
  [Mancino] It is said that in Sicily the tendency is toward 
Forza Italia. But there is not only Forza Italia. There are no 
certainties, but I am told that the Mafia will back new 
political groupings and small, newly formed lists. 
  [D'Avanzo] Craxi too has issued a warning of his own. He is 
talking about arrests, attacks, and murders. Is this a warning 
or intimidation? 
  [Mancino] I do not want to go too far in rejecting Craxi's 
forecasts, because we cannot assume that we are dealing with a 
reckless person... I can say, however, that we have arranged 
for the necessary vigilance and strengthened our protection. 
  [D'Avanzo] Are you happy even though there are people at 
large that want to kill [Judge] Di Pietro? 
  [Mancino] The latest warning in his regard is a 
controversial 
matter and still remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, it 
is true: There are some indications that must not be ignored. 
The protection around Di Pietro has been very thorough for some 
time, and it was further stepped up some time ago.

<F P=106> [Report by Angelo Lupoli: "Maneuvers Round the Corner"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Despite the efforts which have been made, 
the accounts do not balance: The budget deficit is set to widen 
during the year, even if 1993 brought a slight improvement. In 
fact, not all the objectives set by the government are easily 
attainable and the impact of the economic crisis is weighing 
more heavily than expected. 
  Pending publication of the quarterly figures, however, no 
one 
is hazarding to advance numbers, even if recourse to a new 
economic maneuver already appears inevitable. Yesterday both 
the ABI [Italian Bankers Association] and the European 
Commission confirmed that Italians will be called on to make 
certain sacrifices in 1994. But the choice of measures will 
fall to the government which will be formed after 27 March. 
  The status of the public finances was set out on Tuesday [15 
March] at Palazzo Chigi [government seat] where Auditor General 
Andrea Monorchio met Prime Minister Carlo Azegli Ciampi. 
Conversations focused on the quarterly report, which could be 
available as early as the beginning of next week, with very 
positive accounts thanks to Ciampi's belt-tightening on 
expenditures. 
  The prime minister and the economics ministers have not 
fallen prey to easy enthusiasm. The first quarter's good 
performance, however, is only temporary and the benefits could 
be lost in the coming months. 
  In fact, according to initial projections, there could be a 
shortfall of 5 trillion lire in the 1994 objective of 446 
trillion in tax receipts, while the 10 trillion of "savings" 
which the Cassese package is supposed to bring about will be 
difficult to achieve. In short, the shortfall, as already 
underlined by the IMF, is likely to be on the order of 15 
trillion, which will have to be through an ad hoc maneuver: due 
in part at least to the lower cuts achieved in spending. The 
ABI too confirms this supposition in its monthly report: For 
the banks, the failure to meet the budget deficit objective and 
the slow economic recovery make it impossible to contain 1994 
requirements at 144 trillion. 
  The path to be taken in order to get the public accounts 
back 
on track, is not, however, indicated, even if the new government 
will have very limited room for maneuver. Imposing new taxes is 
out of the question. Fiscal pressure, as the IMF itself has 
pointed out, is too high. The only measures which are open 
relate to the contents of public expenditures, and in 
particular, the revision of the resources earmarked for social 
security. A decision which is considered unpopular and not 
pursuable in tight times. 
  The need for a new public finance measure is not, however, 
viewed with particular concern by the European Union. "Italy's 
public accounts are on the right track: There should not be 
particular problems in the granting of the third installment of 
the Community's 8 billion ECU balance of payments loan, Giovanni 
Ravasio, the Commission's Director General of Economic Affairs 
explained. "For the granting of the third installment of the 
loan we have agreed with the Italian Government that we will 
examine the situation in April- May. Once the accounts for the 
first three months of the year are known," Ravasio continued, 
"we will assess whether, and to what extent, it will be 
necessary to rebalance the public accounts in order to attain 
the objectives already agreed between the Community and the 
Italian Government". He added that "it may be that some 
adjustment will be necessary, but it will be a totally bearable 
one, within the reach of the government and citizens." 
  The Commission will also have to assess the effect of the 
recession on tax receipts. "From the first, partial indications 
available to us," the Commission's director general for economic 
affairs went on, "it would appear that the situation has not 
become worse. Therefore, I believe that achieving the planned 
target is within the government's capacity. The data on the 
deficit, for the first months of the year, are better than 
forecast. We do not yet have the details, and we cannot, for 
the time being, attribute this improvement with certainty to 
improved receipts or to a slowing down of public expenditure." 
  The year 1993 also closed with an improvement: The deficit 
amounted to 153,539 billion compared with a requirement of 
158,840 billion in 1992, calculated according to the new version 
which excludes public agencies which have been converted into 
limited liability companies. At the end of the financial year, 
the tax offices recorded final receipts of 510,630 billion, 
compared with final expenditure of 650,180 billion, with a net 
balance to be financed of 148,550 billion. To this must be 
added a 4,989 billion deficit relating to treasury management 
operations.

Party [PSOE] has ended. Party Secretary General Felipe 
Gonzalez closed the congress. Antonio Criado reports from 
Madrid's Palace of Congresses. 
  [Criado] This congress will go down in history because it 
marks the difference between one period and another. This is 
what Secretary General Felipe Gonzalez said in his closing 
address to the 33d congress. According to Felipe Gonzalez this 
has been the best congress in the past 20 years. In short, he 
was extremely satisfied both with the renewal and the 
integration that the party has undergone. According to Felipe 
Gonzalez, wounds have to be healed with generosity -- a 
generosity that has to be extended to integration of all wings 
in the party during the provincial congresses.

<F P=106> [Mariano Guindal report: "Unemployment Grew by 12,000 </F>
People in February -- Four Times Less Than in 1993"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The first estimates made by the 
Ministry of Labor and Social Security indicate that the number 
of job losses registered by INEM [National Employment Institute] 
in February stood at 12,000, as against the 48,888 registered in 
the same month of 1993. This figure shows a radical change in 
the trend in unemployment, since there was a net increase in the 
number of jobs being created for the first time since the crisis 
began. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra asserted yesterday that 
"there are now signs of economic recovery which make it possible 
to say we have rounded the corner in the crisis and the worst is 
over." Nevertheless, he emphasized that unless society as a 
whole -- government, trade unions, and employers -- continues to 
keep up a considerable effort, it will not be possible to 
maintain sustained growth as a job-promoting factor. 
  Speaking to Spanish National Radio, Serra said that the 
February unemployment figures, which the Labor Ministry will 
present officially Saturday, "will represent the beginning of a 
radical change in the trend in unemployment in Spain." 
  Nevertheless, this recovery in employment has not been 
enough 
to absorb the increase in the working population. Serra stated 
that the fact that the first signs of recovery are appearing is 
causing a larger number of citizens to register at INEM offices. 
This is why the number of unemployed will continue to rise, 
although at a much more moderate rate. "The number of 
unemployed will begin to fall significantly during the summer 
months, which is when there is the greatest activity in 
services." 
  The Labor Ministry emphasizes that the most significant 
thing 
about February is that for the first time there is a net 
increase in employment, since the number of enterprises' labor 
contracts exceeds the number of job losses. 
<H5>  Net Jobs Are Created </H5>
  The second indicator of the labor market's recovery comes 
from the increase in social security contributors, whose numbers 
grew for the first time by 71,000 contributors. It must be 
pointed out that this rise comes after a systematic fall for 24 
months, which represented a drop of over 800,000 contributors. 
According to government sources, this improvement in the labor 
market is due to a recovery in the economic situation and to the 
first fruits which the new apprenticeship and practical training 
contracts are producing. Up to 20 February, 35,000 contracts of 
these kinds were signed. 
  These figures show that there has been no "replacement 
effect," as the trade unions have been maintaining. According 
to the available figures, it is not true that enterprises have 
dismissed permanent workers in order to hire apprentices. 
  Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan said in the Congress [of 
Deputies] lobbies yesterday that February's figures represent 
the breaking of a trend for unemployment to rise. "While 
waiting to learn the official figures, it must be stated that 
February was hopeful, since this month is traditionally bad for 
employment, and yet there was a net increase." 
  After asserting that the new forms of hiring "are going very 
well," he stressed that, contrary to the fears expressed by 
various sectors, apprentices have not replaced permanent 
workers, since "the number of of apprentices coincides with the 
increase in hiring which has occurred in general." He 
emphasized the construction sector's good performance and 
expressed his confidence that "the trend will continue over the 
next few months." 
  On the economic situation, Narcis Serra believes that the 
signs the recovery has begun have been reflected not just in the 
trend in the labor market but in industrial activity, car sales, 
cement and power consumption, and the sharp fall in interest 
rates. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
unidentified correspondent on 21 March] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Correspondent] French and 
foreign newspapers are still talking this morning about Germany 
and France. Can you tell us something about Franco-German 
relationship? What is the situation like? 
  [Juppe] Things are going very well indeed. I will tell you a 
secret. I spoke on the phone with German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel for half an hour yesterday evening. We discussed the 
forthcoming European meetings. There is one in Brussels 
tomorrow, and another over the weekend [26-27 March] in Greece. 
We want France and Germany to have a common position. Bilateral 
ties are doing well at the level of foreign ministers, prime 
minister and chancellor or president. So, what are the reasons 
which made you ask such a question? First, in a bilateral 
relationship, this does not mean that sometimes you can't have 
different opinions. This happens to couples, as we know. We are 
absolutely determined to preserve the link between Germany and 
France. It is the foundation for construction of the European 
Union [EU]. There are no problems, either in France or in 
Germany. But sometimes we have different opinions. Second, 
elections are being held in Germany. When there are elections, 
there can be an internal debate and sometimes it is about the 
relations between France and Germany. But I am absolutely 
convinced that nothing really important has changed -- both as 
far as the people are concerned and, more importantly, as far as 
real issues are concerned.

  [Text] Paris, March 20 (AFP) -- President Francois 
Mitterrand said Sunday [20 March] he had spoken personally to 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a bid to defuse a diplomatic 
row which blew up last week between France and Germany. 
  A "dialogue" is underway between advisers to the two 
leaders, 
the French president told AFP, aimed at mending fences between 
the two normally close allies. 
  In a move highly unusual between friendly states, German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Thursday summoned French 
ambassador Francois Scheer to explain remarks he allegedly made 
about the German attitude toward the European Union. Scheer had 
spoken earlier to German journalists on condition of anonymity. 
  Relations between the two countries also became strained 
after Kohl was omitted from celebrations for the 50th 
anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy, taking place on 
June 6. 
  Mitterrand moved to play down the row, saying he had 
discussed "these issues by telephone with the Chancellor last 
week," adding: "Our advisers have met. The dialogue is 
continuing." 
  He said he would meet Kinkel next Thursday "as has been 
scheduled for a long time." 
  Mitterrand said Kohl had "not asked me" for an invitation to 
the D-Day memorial ceremonies, adding: "I'm considering with the 
prime minister (Edouard Balladur) what is the best way to... 
celebrate the 50th anniversary as it should be and mark that, 
after the period we're commemorating, has come historically 
unprecedented cooperation." [sentence as received] 
  Recalling that cooperation between the two countries had led 
to the creation of a French-German military corps, "a European 
corps," Mitterrand said: "We remain in this spirit." 
  The French president said he and Kohl had done "lots of work 
together in the best spirit and we shall continue to do so in 
the interest of both our countries and Europe."

  [Text] Paris, March 18 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur met on Friday morning [18 March] with European 
Commission president Jacques Delors to discuss "all European 
questions", Delors said after the talk. 
  He said that during their meeting lasting almost 45 minutes, 
the two men had discussed "fishing, efforts the community is 
going to make to help in restructuring and modernizing the 
French fishing fleet, and the enlargement of the European Union 
and institutional problems relating to that issue". 
  He added that they had discussed the situation of Air France 
airline, the national carrier. 
  Both men are potential French presidential candidates in 
next 
year's elections.

<F P=106> [Statement on first round of cantonal elections by Charles </F>
Pasqua, minister of the interior and territorial development -- 
live] 
  [Text] We are no longer in the realm of projections but in 
that of results. Out of 1,922 cantons where elections were 
taking place we now have final results for 1,563 cantons and 
13.5 million registered voters. The turnout was 62 percent, and 
valid votes represented 59 percent, that is 7.97 million votes. 
The majority gets 3.63 million votes, that is 45.7 percent. 
The Left, all of the Left, gets 3,284,000 votes, that is 41.2 
percent, 10.7 percent for the Communist Party and 22.7 percent 
for the Socialist Party. The Greens get 250,000 votes, that is 3 
percent. The National Front gets 725,000 votes, that is 
slightly more than 9 percent. 
  Out of 1,641 cantons, 564 councillors have been elected or 
reelected in the first round, 400 of them are from the majority, 
101 are Socialists, 38 various left, and 20 are Communists. As 
far as the majority is concerned, 123 Rally for the Republic 
councillors have been elected, 154 for the French Democratic 
Union, and 123 various rightists have been elected. Eight of 
the nine members of the cabinet who were candidates in these 
elections were elected in the first round; the ninth got an 
absolute majority but will have to enter the second round since 
he did not get 25 percent of the votes of the registered voters. 
  As I said earlier, these cantonal elections demonstrate that 
the majority has strengthened its position one year after the 
March 1993 legislative elections and that the gains of the 
Socialist Party were mostly made at the expense of the Greens.

  [Text] The first round confirms the trust of the French in 
the majority which they elected last year. It can even be said 
that it is stronger than it was last year. This also indicates 
that, despite the current difficulties, the French have the 
feeling that the majority and the government are doing 
everything they can to get the country on its feet again. It is 
difficult, more difficult than you can imagine, but we are very 
encouraged by this result. You all said that this would be a 
test -- I did not, you did -- well the test is here and I have 
the feeling that [the results have been] rather favorable for us.

<F P=106> [Report signed "J.P.": "Presidential Election: Balkany </F>
Chooses Balladur and Causes Political Upheaval"] 
  [Excerpts] Following Simone Veil and Francois Leotard, RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] Deputy Patrick Balkany yesterday openly 
declared his support for Edouard Balladur's candidacy in the 
presidential election, and he invited the majority and its 
[party] chiefs to unite and "close ranks" behind the prime 
minister. 
  Mr. Balkany, the mayor of Levallois-Perret [Hauts-de-Seine], 
who also has close links with [Interior Minister] Charles 
Pasqua, has deliberately stirred the rivalry between Mr. 
Balladur and Mr. Chirac. He made his declaration at a time when 
the head of government's rating is dropping in the opinion 
polls, while Chirac's backers, who have been very dejected over 
the past few months, seem to be regaining hope. 
  "All together behind Edouard Balladur!" Balkany wrote in an 
article published in LE MONDE. According to the Hauts-de-Seine 
deputy, "it is time for Edouard Balladur to announce his 
intentions for the presidential election" to quench the 
"cacophony" which currently reigns within the majority. Without 
actually calling them by name, Balkany severely lashed out at 
Jacques Chirac and Valery Giscard d'Estaing when he said that 
"the French are tired of and fed up with the eternal disputes 
between the leaders of the two main majority parties." "It is 
time that a playwright finally writes the last chapter of the 
adventures of Plic and Ploc (nickname sometimes used for the 
leaders of the RPR and UDF [French Democratic Union])." 
<H5>  `Cacophony' </H5>
  Last December, defying Mr. Balladur's "instructions" [not to 
raise the issue of the presidential election], Social Affairs 
Minister Simone Veil and Defense Minister Francois Leotard 
pleaded in favor of the prime minister's candidacy. These 
declarations provoked some commotion within the majority and 
further deteriorated the relationship between the head of 
government and the RPR president. Mr. Balladur is sticking to 
the policy he adopted on entering the Hotel Matignon [prime 
minister's office]: not to talk about the presidential election 
this year and to ask his ministers and the majority to make the 
least possible mention of it. 
  Mr. Balkany's declaration is not likely to put an end to the 
"cacophony" which he denounced in his article. In an interview 
with today's LE FIGARO, Jean-Louis Debre, deputy secretary 
general of the RPR and a well-known supporter of Chirac, 
responded by recalling that Mr. Balladur's appointment to the 
Matignon originated in "a sort of pact" between the prime 
minister and Jacques Chirac, whose "completion" would be 
Chirac's election as president. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Pasqua's Voice? </H5>
  The fact that a deputy from the majority is urging that 
"ranks be closed" behind the prime minister is nothing abnormal; 
that he expresses his support for Edouard Balladur's candidacy 
in the presidential election is, after all, his right. But the 
fact that it is Patrick Balkany, whose links with Charles Pasqua 
are well known, makes the issue particularly important. Could 
it be the views of the interior minister which were expressed in 
the LE MONDE column by the deputy and Levallois-Peret mayor? 
The question is worth asking. Nobody has given an answer so 
far. But the reaction within Jacques Chirac's entourage clearly 
indicates that Patrick Balkany's declaration is not being 
considered as simply an inconsiderate statement by a 
rank-and-file deputy. 
  It should be admitted that the Levallois mayor did not act 
with great subtlety. Thus far, it has only been within the UDF 
camp, through the declarations of Simone Veil and Francois 
Leotard, that voices were heard openly calling for the head of 
government's candidacy for the presidency. That such a call is 
now being made from within the RPR is all the more annoying to 
the Rue de Lille [RPR Headquarters]. It has immediately led to 
an open letter being sent to Patrick Balkany by three Chirac 
supporters, accusing him of divisive action within the majority 
and "cordially" inviting him "not to become the Gaston Lagaffe 
of the RPR." All this will not contribute to a better 
atmosphere within the majority, and leads one to ask what the 
atmosphere will be within the majority in the months to come.

  [Excerpts] The statement in support of Edouard Balladur's 
presidential candidacy made last Tuesday in a column in LE MONDE 
by Patrick Balkany has provoked a lively and quick reaction by 
three RPR [Rally for the Republic] deputies. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday, Alain Juppe, secretary general of the 
neo-Gaullist 
RPR, calmed an issue that threatens to lead to a dangerous 
escalation of the latent rivalry between Mr. Balladur and Mr. 
Chirac in the run-up to the presidential elections. The foreign 
minister called on the majority to "unite" and invited all its 
leading figures "to refrain from prematurely opening the 
presidential campaign, which will come in due time." The 
Republican Party and centrist deputy Jacques Barrot have 
launched a similar appeal, but this did not prevent Equipment 
and Transport Minister Jacques Bosson from affirming that 
Edouard Balladur is "a statesman, an opportunity for France."

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Louis Debre, deputy secretary general </F>
of the Rally for the Republic, RPR, by Thierry Portes; place and 
date not given: "Debre: `Chirac Should Become President'"] 
  [Text] [Portes] Has the position that you have been filling 
for the past year offered you as many rewards as disappointments? 
  [Debre] I do not look for rewards in my position, and I can 
assure I have found none in it. My role is a difficult one, I 
am very much aware of it. My aim is to ensure that the RPR 
remains an effective force, my wish is to support the 
government's action, and I hope to contribute to the election of 
Jacques Chirac to the presidency of the republic. 
  Because of family tradition, my education, and my 
temperament, I do not like indifference and resignedness. In 
fulfilling my duties, I am giving a definite direction to my 
political commitment. From my position, I can observe the 
interplay of political forces and opposing interests, the limits 
of the loyalty of some, and the extent of the loyalty of others. 
Above all, I have had the pleasure of meeting women and men who 
are committed to fighting for the ideas in which they believe, 
disinterested activists, who often expect nothing in return for 
their political commitment. 
  [Portes] With what feelings is the RPR following the 
development of relations between [RPR President] Jacques Chirac 
and [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur? 
  [Debre] Leaders and activists are of course asking 
themselves 
questions about the relations between Jacques Chirac and Edouard 
Balladur. Our leaders do not want a split to occur. In their 
view, there should be no competition between Jacques Chirac and 
Edouard Balladur in the presidential elections. If there is any 
competition, it should be settled directly by the two men 
involved. As for the activists, they are legitimists by nature. 
  [Portes] In other words? 
  [Debre] The older members, those who adhered to our movement 
at the time of general de Gaulle or Georges Pompidou and who 
have developed in a Gaullist tradition, are favorable to Jacques 
Chirac because he led the Gaullists to victory and, through his 
action, prevented the disappearance of Gaullism from public 
life. The others, those who have joined us in the last few 
years, following the creation of the RPR or after 1988, are 
obsessed with divisiveness -- the divisiveness that made us 
lose. For all these activists, everything that has happened 
until now -- victory in the last general elections, Edouard 
Balladur's appointment to the prime ministership -- seems to 
originate in a plan developed by Jacques Chirac and Edouard 
Balladur. They therefore feel that there was a sort of pact 
between the two men. They do not understand why some would like 
to breach this "pact" and call into question a winning team -- 
the aim of this strategy being Jacques Chirac's election to the 
presidency of the republic. 
  [Portes] What about the deputies? 
  [Debre] The majority of the RPR's deputies are loyal to 
Jacques Chirac because they feel that he ardently upholds their 
beliefs. There are some deputies, on the other hand, who are -- 
legitimately -- concerned that the Left might come back into 
power. "Make sure there is only one candidate," this is what 
they are telling us. 
  [Portes] Do you regret some of your remarks concerning the 
government's policies? 
  [Debre] I have never disowned my own convictions, nor have I 
ever betrayed my loyalty to Jacques Chirac. However, I have 
come to realize that, sometimes, what I have said has shocked 
certain members of the government. The government is engaged in 
a difficult and unpopular action. As a deputy, it is my duty to 
support it, and this is precisely what I have always done 
through my voting in Parliament. But it is also my 
responsibility, as the RPR's spokesman, to show those Frenchmen 
who placed their trust in us in 1993 that, when I meet them 
today and they tell me their views, I do not then fail to 
transmit these views to our leaders. 
  Now, I am concerned to see that some, engrossed in the 
difficulties of their task, are imprisoned in their own job, in 
their own unshakable beliefs, and no longer have the ability or 
the time to listen to what the French have to say. However, a 
majority leader must not only support the government's policy, 
he must also act as a link between public opinion and the 
government. 
  What sometimes may have looked like criticism of the 
government was not intended as such in my mind. My aim was 
simply to warn the government, to say: "Watch out, we are 
drifting off course." Frankly, I cannot imagine for a minute 
that anybody has any good reasons to wish the government to fail 
in its task. 
  [Portes] What mistakes did the government and the majority 
make over the past year? 
  [Debre] We have not sufficiently denounced the Socialist 
budget, and we are now paying for its consequences. Moreover, 
we should have been much more active up until October, we should 
have carried out much more profound reforms, thus taking full 
advantage of that very short period of time when a government 
has the opportunity to act without hindrance. Finally, I 
believe that, through certain decisions and appointments, we 
have given the impression that cohabitation was turning to 
complacency. 
  [Portes] Can you give us an example of this? 
  [Debre] In the field of employment, the government was right 
to attempt to launch economic recovery. What was done in the 
spring and the Giraud law were a good starting point. However, 
we were too conformist, traditional, and not sufficiently 
innovative. Why did we not say last year, for example, that any 
company hiring an unskilled youth in 1994 would be exempted from 
paying three fourths of its social security contributions? Why 
procrastinate? Why remain stuck in the same old frozen schemes? 
  [Portes] Quite a few observers and economic analysts believe 
that recovery is just round the corner. Do you share this view? 
  [Debre] As far as I can tell from observing my own region, 
it 
looks as if the crisis is under control. But I do not belive 
recovery is imminent. 
  [Portes] Do you believe the government has the political 
means to continue carrying out reforms? 
  [Debre] I think we did not take enough advantage of the 
grace 
period during which a government is in the position to carry out 
many reforms. Today the government has fewer opportunities to 
do so. I hope it will find new opportunities. 
  [Portes] How? 
  [Debre] We must put back on the agenda what was initially 
envisaged, namely, the plan based on experience gained during 
1986-1988, and which was subsequently conceptualized by Edouard 
Balladur at various stages. This plan placed the prime minister 
and the government outside the presidential perspective. Such a 
positioning, in fact, enabled the government to focus on reform 
and on France's renewal. However, some members of the 
government are giving the impression that they have abandoned 
this aim and that they are addressing electoral requirements. 
In order to restore the image of an efficient government that 
is entirely devoted to helping the country emerge from the 
crisis, the government must show unambiguously that it is not 
concerned about the presidential election, given that the prime 
minister is not a candidate. In this way, the government could 
indeed recover its credibility. Otherwise, the closer we move to 
the presidential election, the less credibility the government 
will have. This would also satisfy those who are denouncing the 
background noise that is spoiling the government's action. 
  [Portes] Do you think that Jacques Chirac can put forward a 
project without implicitly criticizing the government's policies? 
  [Debre] Yes, most definitely. Through his attitude and his 
voting in Parliament, Jacques Chirac has always supported the 
government unfailingly. With this sort of record, he will be 
able to develop an agenda which will not be focused on the past 
or at short-term prospects, but which will be geared to the 
future, apart from and beyond the government's performance. You 
cannot win the presidential election by looking back at the 
past, but rather, you must put forward a plan, an aim. 
  [Portes] Are you in favor of a single majority candidate, 
and 
of organizing primaries for the presidential election? 
  [Debre] I would like to see a single majority candidate for 
the presidency, and I would like this candidate to be Jacques 
Chirac. As far as primary elections are concerned, it is a good 
idea, but organizing them is up to the political forces, it is 
not the state's responsibility.

<F P=106> [Interview with Director General for Armaments Henri Conze </F>
by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux; place and date not given: "Henri 
Conze: `Increase Productivity by 2 Percent per Year'"] 
  [Text] [Desaubliaux] On 19 May last year you were appointed 
the director general for armaments. What expertise do you bring 
to the DGA [General Armaments Directorate]? 
  [Conze] The DGA is an organization comprising 52,000 people 
spread over a good 60 different sites. Its activities are 
wide-ranging. Today, its staff is asking questions, sometimes 
anxiously. Why should we be surprised at this? The strategic 
environment has changed, European unification is making 
progress, economic constraints have increased, etc.. The DGA 
has an extremely positive balance sheet; the French arms 
industry has become number two in the world in terms of quality, 
and number three in terms of its turnover. It owes this success 
-- even if it is not consolidated -- largely to a particularly 
effective dialogue between the armed forces, the DGA, and the 
industrial players involved. The challenge we must meet, 
without (for pity's sake) breaking the instrument of success, is 
to make the organization develop so as to take better account of 
the new national, international, and European data. 
  [Desaubliaux] Is the current period, mid-way between the 
1993 
general election and the presidential election in 1995, not more 
propitious to procrastination than making decisions? 
  [Conze] For one or two years already, at least at the 
European level, the defense industries have been restructuring 
operations on a vast scale. Economic and budgetary constraints 
are forcing them to do so. Major reorganization is under way, 
involving alliances, mergers, and acquisitions. Matra, Thomson, 
Giat-Industries, and others have shown the way. Today, the 
process is gathering speed. Negotiations have been launched in 
the missiles sector, between Matra and British Aerospace, and 
between Aerospatiale and DASA [Deutsche Aerospace]. More 
reorganization will follow and, in the relatively short term, 
other sectors will be involved: terrestrial armaments and, why 
not, the Air Force and Navy? This makes it all the more 
essential to define a strategy and fix objectives meeting the 
real operational needs of our armed forces. 
  [Desaubliaux] In the context of European cooperation, is it 
sufficient to openly proclaim your willingness and determination" 
  [Conze] If we do not succeed in securing effective economic 
cooperation, whole parts of the European arms industry will 
vanish. We can no longer do everything alone. This cooperation 
must leave the beaten track where, all too often, requirements 
were added up, management structures were superimposed, and 
national and international decisions were accumulated. What 
should we do? The answer must first be left up to the 
industrial parties involved. They must reorganize themselves, 
then determine "who does what where." The rationalization 
procedure must be implemented on an industrial basis and derive 
its support from various programs. The path we should follow is 
that of transnational industrial cooperation. Our priority 
must be to take account of operational requirements. At the 
risk of appearing slightly heretical, I would be tempted to ask 
not for a law on programs, but a law on requirements. 
  [Desaubliaux] Let us take the future transport plane, the 
FLA 
[Future Large Aircraft], as an example. 
  [Conze] This program is essential for both industry and the 
Armed Forces. I hope that it can be reorganized around the 
Airbus consortium because of the consortium's know-how, because 
of industrial rationality, and also because we must encourage 
the development of the European aeronautics industry. 
<H5>  Nuclear Sector: Rock Bottom Budget </H5>
  [Desaubliaux] Will the programs already launched and new 
requirements not prove imperative? 
  [Conze] If we continue committing the errors made in the 
past, there would be a need for a considerable budget increase. 
However, is it not be possible to reduce the increase required 
through better organization, better relations between the state 
and industry, and further developing the dialogue between the 
DGA, the Armed Forces, and industrial partners? This is what 
the white paper is suggesting. It is also the direction in 
which the DGA is reorganizing itself. Changing attitudes and 
modernized methods, e.g., by adapting the code for public 
procurement contracts or contract regulations, should enable us 
to fulfil the main requirements and achieve the key aspects of 
the programs, all while keeping within a reasonable budgetary 
framework. Increasing productivity by 2 percent each year does 
not seem to be an objective that is beyond the bounds of 
possibility. If we succeed in this, using a budget which is 
stretched to the limit, then we should end up having no need to 
resort to any major rethinking. 
  [Desaubliaux] What about the reform of the Naval 
Constructions Directorate (DCN)? 
  [Conze] Our objective here is to maintain, or even 
reinforce, 
the role and skills of the French military naval industry in 
Europe. We already have centers of excellence for this. I would 
add that we have embarked on a first large-scale European 
cooperation project, involving the Horizon frigate. This 
represents a major challenge. Our wish is to see this project 
through to the end, but nothing has been achieved yet at 
present. However, the structures of the DCN -- not to mention 
its status -- should further be changed. 
  [Desaubliaux] Various studies have predicted the loss of 
110,000 jobs in the defense industry over the next two years. 
And yet, you appear to brush aside all talk of dramatic 
reforms. Why? 
  [Conze] We must endeavor to ensure that the necessary 
reorganization and restructuring--what has already decided and 
what is still to come--does not result in the disappearance of 
either large or small companies. Their technological competence 
is unique in various domains in Europe. For two years, 1992 and 
1993, the arms industry paid a heavy price; representing 5 
percent of industrial jobs, it accounted for 25 percent of job 
losses in industry. As I said several months ago, I am 
convinced that this industry will emerge from the difficulties 
it has recently encountered. So I remain optimistic. 
  [Desaubliaux] In the nuclear sector, are there any urgent 
decisions to be made? 
  [Conze] Modern systems are currently in service. In a few 
months' time, the nuclear submarine "Triomphant" will be armed 
with the M45 missile. The medium-range air-to-ground missile, 
the Hades, has been operational for fewer than 10 years and, 
even if it was mothballed, it is also a modern system. 
Successors will have to be ready by around 2010 or 2015. So 
there is no compelling urgency. The real challenge to be met is 
that of maintaining the level of competence, and scientific, 
technological, and industrial resources: the competence of the 
CEA [Atomic Energy Commission], Aerospatiale, SEP [European 
Propulsion Company], SNPE [French National Gunpowder and 
Explosives Company], etc. From the national point of view and 
perhaps, in the long term, the European one as well. 
  [Desaubliaux] Will nuclear tests remain essential? 
  [Conze] Having spent 17 years in the nuclear sector, I can 
tell you that each test had a well-defined objective and 
fulfilled a well-evaluated need. When the moratorium was agreed 
in mid-1992, a series of tests had been prepared. The PALEN 
simulation program has been ongoing for several years now. We 
can expect a reduction, both in the number of tests carried out, 
and in the cost of the nuclear programs. However, its 
perfection, which ought to be accelerated, would require the 
resumption of tests sooner or later. 
  [Desaubliaux] Can we economize in the nuclear sector? 
  [Conze] Funds earmarked for the nuclear sector have dropped 
considerably in recent years, by something like 25 percent. We 
have now reached rock bottom, if -- in anticipation of a 
resurgence of threats, a scenario that we should not shut out of 
our minds -- we want to maintain our capacity and, if necessary, 
develop new arms. In one of the rare sectors of human 
creativity which covers a considerable number of fundamental 
disciplines, it is all the more important to set ambitious 
targets for the teams involved -- exploratory developments, 
demonstration projects -- even if there is no program to be 
developed in the immediate future. 
  [Desaubliaux] Before returning to the DGA, you had said you 
were in favor of having a ground-to-ground missile. 
  [Conze] Faced with certain kinds of threat, there may be 
systems more or less well suited to dealing with them. The 
ground-to-ground missile has its virtues, otherwise there would 
never have been any! In this respect, I am sticking to my 
convictions.

<F P=106> [Kjell Dragnes report: "Norwegian UN Force Leaves Somalia"] </F>
  [Text] The Norwegian UN force in Bosnia is now being 
withdrawn. The main group will come home Sunday [20 March]. 
Approximately 120 of the Norwegian soldiers who have served in 
the headquarters company in the Somalian capital of Mogadishu 
will arrive by plane in Gardermoen. They will then continue on 
to Onsrud barracks for medical tests and to hand in all their 
equipment before being dismissed. 
  "Once again, it will be a withdrawal command group 
comprising 
10 men that will monitor the loading and shipping of equipment," 
said Colonel Ove Stromberg of FDI 4/IR4 [expansion unknown] in 
charge of mobilizing the UN forces in that country. The group 
in question will be traveling home just before Easter, leaving 
behind just five Norwegians who will help the remaining UN force 
to take over the headquarters. These last five men will return 
in early May. 
  Most of the equipment that the Norwegian company had at its 
disposal will be transported back to Norway, while some will be 
sold in Somalia, and Stromberg revealed that some will also be 
given to aid organizations. 
<H5>  Check </H5>
  Once they have returned, both troops and officers will be 
subjected to the same procedures as all UN troops undergo. 
These will comprise a medical check and talks, and Onsrud also 
intends to take up contact with the civil health authorities 
covering the areas where the soldiers live to ask them to do any 
necessary follow-up. This is something that has been done in the 
wake of a major UNIFIL [UN Interim Force in Lebanon] study of 
servicemen who had returned from Lebanon. 
  It has been suggested that the Somalia company will be 
eligible for transfer to Bosnia, but Stromberg ruled this out. 
The troops will be dismissed in the usual manner, although it 
is of course by no means out of the question that some of them 
will be selected again -- say for service in Bosnia, he said. 
  UN duty is beginning to be a heavy burden on the Norwegian 
defense authorities, and certain categories of specialized 
personnel are extremely hard to find. This is the case, for 
example, for mechanics, who are meant to keep the fleet of 
vehicles in good running order. It is also proving difficult to 
find enough people in the medical service. The defense 
authorities want a form of rotation so that UN service does not 
become a "life-style" and would prefer to see around 25 percent 
of personnel receiving new contracts. However, in some groups 
this percentage is already close to 40. 
  Indian and Pakistani troops will now be the main force 
within 
UNOSOM -- the UN force in Somalia. The force totals 20,000 men. 
The U.S. forces will be out of the country before the end of the 
month.

<F P=106> [Gunnar Magnus report: "Toward a Referendum in November"] </F>
  [Text] Norwegian voters may have to fight their way 
through storm, snow, cold, and darkness to cast their votes on 
EU [European Union] membership. 
  So far it seems most likely that the referendum on the EU 
will be held at some time in November, and probably in the 
latter half of the month. However, a precondition is that the 
EU next week clears up its internal disagreement on voting 
rules. This would then mean that the European Parliament could 
debate the matter in May, and that the new members could be 
admitted beginning on 1 January next year. 
  At her news conference in the early hours of Tuesday [15 
March] morning, Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland indicated 
that the referendum will come toward the end of the year. She 
also announced that the party leaders and the leaders of the the 
yes and no movements will be invited to discuss the date. 
  Formally, the government will put a proposal to the Storting 
fixing the date. It is the Municipal Affairs Ministry that is 
responsible for the holding of the referendum. Municipal 
Affairs Minister Gunnar Berge has told AFTENPOSTEN that as soon 
as the situation has finally been clarified, he will be able to 
put a bill with a concrete proposal for the date for the 
referendum before the Storting relatively quickly. 
  Last fall the Storting adopted a surprising resolution 
requesting the government to initiate contacts with the aim of 
adopting a common date for the referendums in the three Nordic 
applicant countries. At the recent meeting of the Nordic 
Council, Berge announced that such contacts had been made, but 
that the other countries would choose dates on the basis of 
their national political processes. In Sweden, June and 
November are possible alternatives, while the Finns are looking 
at a referendum in September. 
  Reports that the Swedes are now looking at a referendum in 
November has given new fuel to Norwegian hopes for a common 
referendum date. A Norwegian referendum before the summer is 
not being considered. 
  The Labor Party will hold its regular national congress from 
10 to 13 November. The party's position on the membership 
agreement will be decided at an extraordinary national congress 
in May or June. 
  Some people take the view that if there is not a common date 
for the referendums in all three countries Norway should at 
least go to the polls on the same day as one of the other 
countries. Christian People's Party leader Kjell Magne Bondevik 
backs this alternative, as does Center Party leader Anne Enger 
Lahnstein. 
  Paul Chaffey of the Socialist Left Party would like the 
referendum on the same day as Sweden, but is less concerned 
about Finland. 
  The Conservative Party has a different position: According 
to Per-Kristian Foss, the deputy leader of the party's Storting 
group, it would be an advantage for Norwegian voters if they 
know how things have gone in Sweden and Finland. In the 
Progress Party, deputy chairman Hans J. Rosjorde takes the same 
view.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Historic Crossroads for Norway"] </F>
  [Text] The government has every reason to be satisfied 
with the job it has done in the negotiations for membership of 
the European Union [EU]. This applies in particular to 
Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen who in the early hours of 
yesterday brought home a fisheries agreement that in every 
important respect protects our vital interests. But the real 
job is only now beginning for him too because it is his task to 
convince the fishing population that it can feel secure that our 
responsible management of fish resources in the north will 
continue even after the period of transitional arrangements runs 
out. 
  There can be no objections to the agreement. Now that the 
final piece is in place we have -- as Prime Minister Gro Harlem 
Brundtland has pointed out -- achieved an agreement that 
guarantees Norway an equal place in the shaping of Europe's 
future. We should therefore seize "this historic opportunity to 
take part in the political cooperation on our continent, 
alongside our Nordic neighbors." 
  The prime minister is right when she says that by doing so 
we 
will be able to achieve greater influence over political 
cooperation on employment, the environment, and social security. 
And -- no less important -- it is within this community that we 
will best be able to defend out foreign and security policy 
interests. There can be no doubt that we have a contribution to 
make to the shaping of tomorrow's Europe. 
  But the government should not think that the completion of 
the negotiations means that it has done its bit. It is now that 
the real work will start, for the prime minister, for the 
fisheries minister, and -- for that matter -- for all the others 
who are convinced that our future must be based on full 
participation in committed European cooperation. For we will 
not become members of the EU unless the majority of the 
Norwegian people is persuaded -- and persuaded among other 
things that membership will "increase our right of 
self-determination in relation to the forces that we today have 
too little control over." 
  At the start of the battle for the soul of the Norwegian 
people -- for this is what the battle will basically be about -- 
the prime minister should not entertain hopes that the debate 
will be very different from the debate 22 years ago. 
Predictions that we are moving toward catastrophe are already 
lining themselves up. The more measured evaluations of EU 
membership in which many people are putting their faith are not 
as yet dominating the debate. 
  On the one side there are the fundamentalist opponents of EU 
membership who claim without reservation that the choice is 
between continuing as an independent state or being swallowed up 
by a new and monolithic state that is coming into being. 
Hopefully the majority will not take this distorted picture of 
the committed cooperation among independent states as the gospel 
truth. After all, to the very end of the at times extremely 
difficult and dramatic negotiations we now have behind us, we 
have seen crystal clear examples that show that member states 
know how to defend their special interests. This is true of the 
negotiations on fisheries issues in particular. 
  Further confirmation of this is provided by the fact that 
the 
EU also has to sort out its own internal conflicts and its 
voting rules before the Community will be in a position to admit 
the four applicants nations that have now completed their 
negotiations for membership. Despite the prospect of 
forthcoming membership, it still remains to be seen whether the 
majority of the Norwegian people will allow themselves to be 
persuaded that the EU is something very different from what its 
opponents claim it is. This battle can only be won through an 
active and accurate information campaign about what we are 
actually facing, and about the unique opportunities that are now 
emerging. 
  After all, the view the opponents of EU membership like to 
take of things is inaccurate -- that the choice is between 
stepping into an unknown future and continuing as if nothing had 
happened. The fact is that we applied for membership in part as 
a consequence of the fact that our neutral and nonaligned 
neighbors applied for membership as a result of a recognition 
that it was a completely new Europe that was taking shape after 
the demolition of the Berlin wall. We have already had painful 
experience of the international trends that have washed over 
Norway with full force. In our dealings with the problematic 
real world it will be of crucial importance that we are there to 
plead our cause when important decisions are to be made. 
  The most dramatic choice we could make in this new situation 
would be to opt to remain outside. It is not difficult to 
undertand that people might have wanted a different situation in 
Europe. However, the fact is, as Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore 
Godal pointed out in Brussels the other night, that all the 
other countries of Europe are now taking their bearings in 
relation to the EU. Regardless of how many people may emerge as 
opponents of the EU, Norway cannot create its own alternative 
world. We must relate to the Europe of which we are part when, 
after a thorough debate, we go to vote in a referendum. 
  As far as the timing of the referendum is concerned, we 
should take the time we need. An additional consideration is 
that what Sweden and Finland do will probably play a decisive 
role for the majority of the Norwegian people. The worst thing 
that could happen would be that the border between the new 
Europe and Norway were to be drawn between Norway and Sweden. A 
common date for the referendums in the Nordic countries would 
conflict with our national interests.

<F P=106> [Christer Kallstrom report: "Norwegian Fisherman Are </F>
Hopping Mad"] 
  [Text] Oslo -- Fishermen and farmers in Norway are angry 
at the membership agreement that the Norwegian negotiators have 
concluded in Brussels. The fishermen are claiming that Norway 
is handing over the control over its fish resources to the EU 
[European Union]. Farmers are angry because the systems of 
economic support for agriculture are being cut. 
  It is fish that has been the major obstacle for Norway in 
the 
membership negotiations. Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen, 
generally called "No-Fish Henry," stated even before the 
negotiations began that he did not have a single fish to give 
away. 
  But in the course of the negotiations the fisheries minister 
has had to give away a fish or two -- in the end totaling 4,000 
tonnes for Spain and Portugal. 
  Similarly "No-Fish Henry" promised that Norway would retain 
control over the fish resources in Norwegian seas. However, the 
final outcome was that the fishing waters north of the 62d 
parallel will be managed by the EU from 1 July 1998. However, 
Norway has received political assurances from the EU that the 
current Norwegian management regime will continue to apply in 
the future too. This means in practice that the EU will take 
over the body of Norwegian regulations. 
  Norway will also have duty-free access to the European 
market 
for its fish products. This will apply from day one of 
Norwegian membership. 
  But fishermen in Norway are very dissatisfied with the 
results of the negotiations, and Einar Hepsoe, the leader of the 
Association of Norwegian Fishermen, said: 
  "The agreement was worse than I hade been fearing from the 
outset. We have lost on all important points. Norway has given 
away its management rights and control over fish resources." 
  However, representatives of the fish industry think that the 
agreement is a good one. It gives Norway good opportunities for 
the export of fish products to the European market. 
  Agriculture has been the other major bone of contention for 
Norway in the negotiations. The agreement gives three different 
types of support for Norwegian agriculture. These are support 
for agriculture north of the 62d parallel, support for 
"difficult" areas (mountainous regions and the like), and 
support for environmentally friendly agriculture. In addition, 
Norway has been forced to accept EU prices for agricultural 
produce from the first day of membership. 
  Farmers' and the food industry's organizations are deeply 
dissatisfied with the agreement that they think could lead to 
130,000 people losing their jobs. 
  However, Norway will retain control over its oil and gas 
resources even after it becomes an EU member. The Norwegians 
can also continue to catch whales, but products from them may 
not be exported. The agreements on alcohol, the environment, 
taxation and duties have not given rise to any debate in the 
country -- at least not yet. Norway will retain its tough 
environmental, health, and alcohol levies. On the other hand 
Norway will have to introduce value-added tax on some services 
that today are exempt from value-added tax, such as overnight 
stays in hotels. 
  Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland has expressed her great 
happiness with the agreement with the EU. She is not surprised 
by the fishermen's and farmers' criticism of the agreement. 
  "Even before the agreement was reached, these groups had 
already made up their minds about what they would think. They 
say no to the EU regardless of the outcome of the negotiations." 
  Gro Harlem Brundtland admitted that Norway has had to give 
way on a couple of points, including the adjustment of the 
prices of agricultural produce from day one. 
  "We were making very ambitious demands from the very 
beginning. If we had not done so I think that we would not have 
achieved the favorable results which we have achieved today," 
the prime minister said. 
  Center Party chairman Anne Enger Lahnstein is disappointed 
with the results from the negotiations. 
  "The negotiators have given way on all points. The most 
important one is our management of fisheries north of the 62d 
parallel where 95 percent of our fish resources are to be found. 
The EU will eventually assume control over these. It is true 
that we have been given political assurances that Norwegian 
management rules will continue to apply here, but we have not 
been given any legally binding guarantees. This worries me." 
  Conservative Party leaders Kaci Kullmann Five takes a 
positive view of the agreement, however: 
  "I believe that it will be completely possible to win a 
majority for this agreement in a referendum. We have not gotten 
our way on everything, but you never do in negotiations." 
  The Confederation of Norwegian Industry (NHO) is satisfied 
with the agreement that can now form the basis for the debate on 
Norwegian EU membership. 
  "If Finland and Sweden decide to become members of the EU, 
there will be significant negative repercussions for Norwegian 
industry and commerce, the Norwegian economy, and employment if 
Norway does not become a member," NHO president Svein Aaser said. 
  Now that the EU agreement is complete, the debate on 
Norwegian membership will start. It is as yet still unclear on 
what day the referendum will take place, but according to 
Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal, it will probably be in six to 
seven months. However, if today's opinion polls are taken as an 
indicator, Norway will not join the EU. Today 44 percent say no 
to the EU, 29 percent yes, and 27 percent have not made up their 
minds.

  [Excerpt] It is finally clear, Sunday,13 November will be 
the day of the national referendum on the European Union [EU], 
the party leaders agreed today. This means that Prime Minister 
Carl Bildt, who wanted to have the national referendum in June, 
has given in to the Social Democrats who wanted to have the 
national referendum in November. The most important thing is 
that in this way Sweden can become a member on 1 January next 
year, Carl Bildt says. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Anita Kratz report: "EU Disagreement an Argument for </F>
Social Democratic Leader"] 
  [Excerpt] The disagreement within the EU [European Union] 
about its voting rules has strengthened Social Democratic Party 
leader Ingvar Carlsson's conviction that a Swedish referendum is 
not possible before November. 
  He also supports the proposal that 27 votes in the Council 
of 
Ministers should be needed to block decisions. This is 
something that the government has so far been careful not to 
have any views about. 
  The Swedish negotiators do not want to interfere in 
something 
that they consider to be an internal EU affair. 
  The present rules state that 29 percent of votes are needed 
to block a decision in the Council of Ministers. This will mean 
27 votes if the total number of votes in the Council of 
Ministers is increased to 90 after the admission of the new 
members. 
  "I support the idea that it should be 27 votes. This would 
give a stronger EU," Ingvar Carlsson said. 
  Last Tuesday [15 March] the negotiations among the EU's 
foreign ministers reached deadlock, and it will be a week before 
they are resumed. 
  Ingvar Carlsson pointed out that we are now almost three 
weeks after the deadline of 1 March -- a deadline that the 
European Parliament set so that its deputies would have a 
reasonable amount of time to scrutinize the agreements with 
candidates Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria. 
  In mid-April the parliament will complete its examination of 
the membership agreements. 
  Ingvar Carlsson does not think that there is any point in 
discussions among the party leaders tomorrow, Friday [18 March], 
if the other party leaders do not realize that a referendum in 
June is too early bearing in mind the fact that the question of 
the EU's voting rules has still not been resolved. 
  "One more meeting ought to be enough, and then we will reach 
a decision. I am prepared to reach a decision on Friday," 
Ingvar Carlsson said. 
  For Carlsson, November is the only realistic alternative on 
which to reach agreement. Nor does he see any reason for 
concern if Sweden were to become an EU member on 1 February or 1 
March 1995 instead of 1 January 1995. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Ylva Nilsson report: "Sweden Could Lose Its Rebate"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- The Swedish budget rebate that Finance 
Minister Anne Wibble fought so hard for in the EU [European 
Union] negotiations in Brussels will be affected by the date of 
a Swedish referendum. A delay in joining the EU would mean that 
Sweden would lose a year's rebate, or between 1 and 3 billion 
kronor [SKr]. 
  Wibble's argument in Brussels was that the contribution to 
the EU would hit hardest in the first years of membership, when 
the expected positive social effects of membership would not yet 
have occurred. In the negotiations with the EU, Sweden won a 
rebate of SKr4.4 billion in 1994, SKr3.9 billion in 1996, and 
SKr0.5 billion in the two subsequent years. 
  If Swedish accession to the EU does not happen until 1996, 
the Swedes will have to accept that the EU side would consider 
the SKr4.4 billion rebate to have been lost, a centrally placed 
source in the membership negotiations said: 
  "That will be the EU's point of departure. Sweden would 
probably then be able to make a case for a renegotiation of the 
rebate, but it will never get back all the SKr4.4 billion -- 
half of them at most." 
  The reason why the Swedish rebate can only last until 1998 
at 
the latest is that the following year the EU budget will be 
renegotiated. If at that point a country has a rebate on its 
budget contribution, the view is that it will have an incentive 
to block an agreement because the rebate will remain in place 
until a new budget is decided.

<F P=106> [Thomas Michelsen report: "Swedish Grain Will Be Worth Its </F>
Weight in Gold -- EU Agreement Great for Cereals and Sugar Beet, 
But Hard Times for Potato Farmers"] 
  [Text] The EU [European Union] agreement will give Sweden's 
farmers a record boost. Farmers will receive approximately 15 
percent more for their cereals if Sweden joins the EU in 1995. 
Sugar beet will net farmers even more through a 30-percent 
price increase. For oil-yielding crops, farmers' incomes will 
increase by "a mere" 10 percent. Not in 20 years will cereal 
farmers' incomes have risen so sharply from one year to the next. 
  At the same time, the agricultural sector will become three 
times as dependent on grants from the public sector. Today, the 
Swedish taxpayer subsidizes the agricultural sector to the tune 
of 3.5 billion Swedish kronor [SKr] each year. When the EU 
takes control of our agricultural policy this support will 
increase to between SKr8 and 11 billion. Precisely how much it 
will rise is something that the Riksdag will decide. In many 
cases the EU only provides such aid if the country in question 
makes equally large -- or even larger -- grants at the same 
time. However, the main aid packages for cereals, fallow land, 
subsidies for animals, export aid, etc., is paid entirely out of 
the EU's agricultural fund in Brussels. Ministry of Agriculture 
adviser Dag von Schantz says that they are calculated to total 
between SKr5 and 6 billion per year. This is augmented by 
environmental aid from the EU totaling a maximum of SKr1.5 
billion. This aid is conditional upon the Swedish state 
expending just as much in the future, too. However, in the 
future it will once again be the Swedish taxpayer who pays the 
lion's share of this. 
  The so-called LFA [less-favored areas] support for less well 
developed areas, the woodlands, islands, etc., could amount to 
SKr1 billion. The EU will pay only one-fourth of this, and the 
Swedish state three-fourths. 
  Altogether, the general aid earmarked for the agricultural 
sector could increase to approximately SKr11 billion. However, 
as stated above, the precondition for this is that Swedish 
taxpayers contribute more, say, EU grants for the environment, 
Norrland, and woodland areas. 
<H5>  Scoffing LRF </H5>
  It is clear that EU membership means farming will, to a 
growing extent, become a kind of "agriculture by money order" 
that LRF [Swedish Farmers' Association] spokesmen formerly 
scoffed at. The greater part of farmers' incomes will be paid 
through various kinds of grant from the EU and the Swedish 
state. And as the grants grow, so will the element of control 
and bureaucracy. At the same time, sales prices for many of the 
farmers' products will drop. The majority of Sweden's farmers, 
who grow vegetables, cereals, oil-yielding crops, sugar beet, 
and so forth will do very well. Today, farmers receive 
approximately SKr1.05 per kg of cereals, plus an acreage 
allowance of SKr900 per hectare. This makes a total price per 
kg of approximately SKr1.25. In the EU, the guaranteed price 
for cereals will drop several ore per kg. In return, the 
acreage allowance will increase to SKr900 per hectare and per 
year. Together, this will make for a price of approximately 
SKr1.45 per kg, according to the LRF. The acreage allowance will 
also increase for other kinds of crops when we join the EU. 
This will result in the combined revenue for sugar beet 
increasing from 30 to 40 ore per kg, according to Hans Ohgren at 
the Agriculture Ministry. The proceeds for oil-yielding crops 
will increase by approximately 10 percent. 
  In the EU, the grant for fallow land, i.e., fields where 
nothing at all is cultivated, will be SKr2,500 per hectare. The 
same grant will be paid for energy forests of willow, or salix, 
SKr2,500 per hectare per year. 
<H5>  Potato Imports </H5>
  Potato growers are a rather small group of farmers who are 
not supported by the EU. Potatoes grown for industrial use, as 
the raw material for French fries and potato chips, will 
probably be imported to a greater extent than is the case today. 
Growers of potatoes for domestic consumption can also count on 
increased competition, while the price of potatoes grown for 
starch is not likely to be affected. 
  Dairy farmers will probably be able to raise their prices by 
between 5 and 10 ore per liter in the EU, LRF chief negotiator 
Lars-Erik Lundkvist believes. On the other hand, the current 
Swedish grant for cows, worth SKr1,200 per animal, will vanish. 
There will be export grants for exports of dairy products 
within the EU. At the same time, Swedish exports to countries 
outside the EU will also receive a proportion of this amount. 
All in all, Lundkvist is optimistic regarding the dairy 
farmers. They might also be supported by EU grants, for 
example, for less well developed areas or the environment. The 
EU grant for bullocks is considerably higher than the Swedish 
equivalent. This will result in an increase from SKr155 per 
bull to at least SKr950. In certain cases, bulls will be 
eligible to receive grants twice. The grant for suckling cows 
and nurse cows, i.e., cows that are not milked but rather 
produce calves, will increase from SKr1,000 to 1,250. While the 
grant for meat production will go up, prices are expected to 
fall. 
  One group of farmers who are expected to find it tough going 
in the EU are the country's pork producers. They will be 
subjected to substantially fiercer competition. In Denmark, 
farmers will receive approximately SKr34 less per kg when they 
sell their young pigs. A drop in prices can also be expected in 
Sweden. 
  Finally, a reservation: The above information comes from 
some of the country's leading experts on agricultural prices. 
However, the EU agreement is extremely recent and has not yet 
been definitively written out on paper. Consequently, the 
figures might have to be adjusted somewhat, although the main 
news is clear as day: Cereal growers will be getting a terrific 
deal.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis described the decisions 
made by the Greek and Cypriot Defense Ministries as significant 
steps toward strengthening Cyprus' defense. In a statement this 
afternoon, after meeting Greek and Cypriot Defense Ministers 
Yerasimos Arsenis and Konstandinos Iliadhis, who briefed him on 
the decisions made, Kliridhis described the work that has been 
made as significant. He added that he is happy because Cyprus' 
defense is safeguarded by the decisions made. He also expressed 
his respect for the Greek prime minister and defense minister 
for implementing the joint defense doctrine. 
  Arsenis said he was satisfied because the agreement is being 
realized. He added that measures have been taken to strengthen 
Greek-Cypriot defense cooperation in all sectors. He added that 
the two ministers agreed to meet regularly to follow 
developments in the implementation of the decisions. The 
National Defense General Staff and the National Guard General 
Staff will establish a joint committee to examine and suggest 
measures about the plans according to the situation at that 
time. He said that many of the measures that have been decided 
during the talks cannot be announced. 
  Iliadhis said the National Guard will be reinforced with new 
members and new arms systems. He added that National Guard 
members will participate in joint military maneuvers.

  [Text] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis 
stressed that the defense cooperation between Greece and Cyprus 
has a clearly defensive, preventive character. In a news 
conference at the conclusion of his visit, Arsenis said that 
Hellenism's defense area from Thrace to the Aegean and over to 
Cyprus is unified and any defense plans that are separate are 
destined to fail. He added that a unified plan of this area 
increases the effectiveness of defense capabilities. 
  The Greek national defense minister said that for Cyprus, 
specific decisions were made for cooperation covering all fields 
-- land, sea and air. In Cyprus, he added, there is an illegal 
occupation and presence of 35,000 Turkish troops, and within the 
framework of the defense cooperation a balance should be 
reestablished, since the occupation troops are not withdrawing, 
in order to safeguard the defense of the Republic of Cyprus. In 
this framework, he said, it has been agreed that the Cypriot 
National Guard needs substantial quantitative and qualitative 
upgrading in order to promote its capabilities. This relates to 
specific arms programs and the qualitative upgrade of personnel, 
he said. Arsenis stressed that what is important is that a 
program for work and a timeframe have been set, so that future 
meetings will deal with which specific measures have been 
implemented and not what is the meaning of the unified defense 
area. 
  Replying to questions, Arsenis said that when there is an 
imbalance of forces, there can be no successful diplomatic 
negotiation. The deterioration of Hellenism's positions, 
Arsenis said, is largely the result of the military imbalance. 
  Cypriot Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis said in the 
news conference that the direction started a few months ago is 
evident, and he expressed the hope that what has been jointly 
decided will be implemented even faster in the future.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis condemned 
the murder of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, chairman of the Committee 
of Solidarity with Kurdistan, adding that he probably fell 
victim to Turkish Security Service agents. In a statement to 
the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, Kasoulidhis said: We 
should not consider Yeoryiadhis' murder to have anything in 
particular to do with Cyprus. Such murders, Kasoulidhis added, 
have been taking place lately in various European countries and 
elsewhere. But, he said, if the aim was to affect the talks on 
the Cyprus issue, [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas will not 
avoid assuming his responsibilities on the talks on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman Vasos 
Lissaridhis said the murder was political, a challenge to 
everyone. He said this is the Turkish answer we get: the murder 
of a genuine man of the people in our country. Lissaridhis 
added that Yeoryiadhis was a man with ideals and principles and 
his actions were always within political boundaries. 
  DISI [Democratic Rally] General Secretary Dhimitrios 
Sillouris said Turks perpetrated Yeoryiadhis' murder. He said 
he is certain this is not the last such act we will see, adding 
that it must be organized, something directly connected with the 
advance of the confidence-building measures. Sillouris said 
Turkish agents circulate unhampered in the free areas of the 
Republic of Cyprus and added that we should all assume our 
responsibilities and protect ourselves through the state 
structure and through cooperation between people and the 
responsible authorities. 
  Yeoryiadhis' murder was also condemned by AKEL's 
[Restorative 
Party of the Working People] press spokesman Nikolaos 
Katsouridhis and DIKO [Democratic Party] Deputy Nikolaos 
Mousiouttas. 
  The National Liberation Front of Kurdistan has strongly 
condemned Yeoryiadhis' murder, which, it says in a statement, 
was planned by the Turkish National Security Council and 
executed by the Turkish Secret Service. The statement also 
notes that the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan will reply 
accordingly to the Attila state, which destroys the people of 
Kurdistan with Ottoman and Mongolian methods.

  The British cargo plane arrived at 1600 yesterday and was 
refueled immediately. The transfer of the arms and ammunition, 
which according to some reports included surface-to-air and 
air-to-air missiles, began two hours later. The Nigerian plane 
was then to depart for Tel Aviv to repair one of its four 
engines, which was the reason it had been stranded at Larnaca 
Airport. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias returned from 
Washington at noon today and in a statement referred to the 
Greek Government's letter which was given to Cyrus Vance, UN 
mediator on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], 
yesterday. Correspondent Nikolaos Meletis reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Meletis] Ambassador Andonios Exarkhos, 
Greece's permanent representative at the United Nations, 
yesterday handed Vance the Greek side's reply to the ideas that 
the international mediator on FYROM had presented in Geneva. 
Returning to Athens at noon today, the foreign minister was 
asked about the contents of the letter and about rumors that the 
two sides will meet Vance in New York within 10 days. 
  [Papoulias] No, I did not meet Vance. What I know--and I 
believe you know it too--is that the reply was given to Vance. 
The letter mentions that Vance's ideas are positive in 
principle and may constitute a basis for further talks if [FYROM 
President Kiro] Gligorov's intransigence is softened. 
  [Meletis] Yesterday, Papoulias briefed European Union [EU] 
Commissioner Hans van den Broek on the contents of the letter. 
He and van den Broek represented the EU at the signing of the 
Croat-Muslim agreement in Washington. Van den Broek conveyed 
his conclusions from his meeting with Gligorov. 
  Referring to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Papoulias 
stressed that in its first phase the U.S. effort has been 
somewhat successful, but noted the significant role that the EU 
is called upon to play. 
  [Papoulias] At their meeting in Ioannina, the EU foreign 
ministers will make significant decisions on the role that the 
EU will play in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.S. factor and Russia 
are certainly welcome, but the EU action plan remains the basis 
for finding a viable and peaceful solution in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros 
Pangalos said that the expansion of the European Union [EU] was 
a mistake, and warned that it could threaten the EU's ability to 
make decisions on its future. Pangalos also warned that the 
possible election of an extreme right coalition in Italy, which 
would be neofascistic, could cause a big political problem for 
Europe. Despite the fact that Pangalos chaired the successful 
negotiations for the accession of four new members to the 
European Union, he stressed: Now that this is over, now that I 
have done my duty, I honestly want to say that this decision was 
a mistake. 
  [Begin recording] [Pangalos] I want to say that the 
decision on the expansion of the European Union was wrong and 
premature. The European Union should not have proceeded to 
assume new responsibilities before the EU's structure was 
deepened, before we made substantial institutional and economic 
changes, and before we finished implementing the Maastricht 
Treaty. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, who 
returned from Cyprus yesterday, said that the process for 
implementation of the unified defense area between Greece and 
Cyprus will advance very quickly. The basis for the defense 
cooperation between Greece and Cyprus was agreed upon during his 
talks in Cyprus. Arsenis stressed that since the UN resolutions 
have not been implemented and the Turkish occupation troops have 
not withdrawn, Cyprus' defense should be reinforced as a 
condition for success in international negotiations.

  [Text] Istanbul, March 20 (A.A) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin said today that everything has not been concluded by the 
signing of a federal agreement between Croats and Bosnians in 
Washington last Friday [18 March] and "what counts is the 
application of this agreement. Now a new phase has begun." 
  In a statement at Istanbul's airport, Cetin, who took part 
in 
the March 18 ceremony in Washington, described the agreement as 
a very important step for the preservation of the territorial 
integrity, sovereignty and independence of Bosnia. 
  "As a country which gained the confidence of both the Croats 
and Bosnians, Turkey will continue its initiatives and efforts 
towards finding an equitable solution to the problem. We also 
believe that this first step should be reinforced by further 
steps," he added. 
  He added that Turkey hoped the Serbian side to take part in 
this agreement, respecting the independence, sovereignty and 
integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Cetin, recalling that people were still being killed by 
Serbs 
in Maglaj, Bihac and Uskara, repeated Turkey's proposal to send 
troops to the UN forces in the region. 
  "This agreement is one of the first test for the world after 
the cold war and the opportunity has arisen to pass it within 
legitimacy," he said.

  [Text] The Russian Embassy in Ankara is carefully following 
the developments related to the tragic incident in the 
Bosphorus. The embassy officials have said that they are not 
prepared to start a debate on the Montreux Agreement just 
because of the accident. However, they also said that they are 
prepared to help Turkey on matters related to the traffic in the 
straits. 
  Embassy officials have announced that they will not make an 
official statement on the incident. Nevertheless, it has been 
ascertained that the Russian diplomats have discussed several 
points on the Bosphorus in the assessments that have made thus 
far. They are as follows: 
  1. The accident is the result of development. Traffic 
accidents claim the lives of many people every day. However, 
highways are not being closed down. In view of that, a single 
incident must not be allowed to create a state of confusion. 
  2. Russia is prepared to do everything it can to contribute 
toward the maintenance of safe passage through the straits in 
Turkey. Reconsidering the Montreux Agreement, which provides 
for free passage through the straits, just because an accident 
has occurred in the Bosphorus, is not necessary. Therefore, we 
are not prepared to reconsider the agreement. 
  3. A delegation arrived in Turkey in connection with the new 
rules and regulations on the sea traffic in the straits and the 
Sea of Marmara at the end of February. We will wait to see the 
outcome of its work in order to be able to make a careful 
assessment on the matter. 
  4. The question of traffic in the straits is not a Turkish 
domestic affair. It is an international matter. 
  5. Each and every vessel that traverses the straits 
contributes toward the safety of the traffic because the ships 
have to pay a certain fee to cross the straits. The funds that 
are raised in that way are used for the straits. 
  6. A debate is being held on how Azerbaijan's and 
Kazakhstan's oil will be transported to the Western countries. 
One of the options is to transport their oil to Novorossiysk in 
Russia. The oil will then be transported in large tankers 
through the straits in Turkey. However, considering the matter 
an "imposition by Russia" would be wrong. Azerbaijan and 
Kazakhstan are independent republics. In view of that, they 
will have to decide. That is not a matter on which Russia 
should decide.

  [Excerpts] The Supreme Military Council met in an 
extraordinary session under the chairmanship of Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller in Ankara today. 
  In an opening statement, Ciller expressed the belief that 
decisions that will contribute to the development of the Armed 
Forces will be adopted at the meeting. She remarked that the 
Turkish Armed Forces fulfill their task with regard to internal 
security in a spirit of self-sacrifice and discharge the duties 
they assume abroad with a view to contributing to world peace. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Begin Ciller recording] The Armed Forces constitute the 
most important guarantee of the country's security and our 
independence. Certain circles that are well aware of this fact 
are engaged in speculations concerning the Turkish Armed Forces 
-- either knowingly, because they are not friends of this 
country, or unknowingly. This saddens us all. Nevertheless, we 
know very well and we believe that our lofty nation is assessing 
the events in the most correct way on the basis of its boundless 
common sense and is aware of the motives behind them. [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  In a statement about the Supreme Military Council meeting, 
Staff Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu, spokesman of the General Staff, 
declared that the political and military situation in light of 
developments in surrounding countries was assessed during the 
meeting. According to the statement, proposals for changes in

<F P=106> [Article by Baran Dural and Can Cevik: "Idealists Will </F>
Create a Surprise in Southeastern Turkey"] 
  [Excerpts] The Democracy Party's decision to "boycott" the 
local elections and the subsequent move by the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan [PKK] to prevent the participation of that party's 
candidates in the elections by threatening to kill them added to 
the existing confusion in southeastern Turkey. Meanwhile, 
"strange" developments have been taking place two weeks before 
the elections in that region; the contesting parties have 
threatened each other several times. Undoubtedly, the most 
interesting development is the fact that one of the political 
parties, which had no foothold in southeastern Turkey until a 
year ago, has become a potential winner. Furthermore, that party 
has challenged the PKK! The unknown aspects of the strange 
developments can be explained as follows: 
  Fikri Aksay, Nationalist Action Party [NAP] mayoral 
candidate 
for the Diyarbakir metropolis, has said: "No other party exists 
to rival us here. All the other parties are only on the posters 
on signboards. Most of them are under the PKK's influence. The 
people do not trust the other parties. The Motherland Party's 
candidate expressed his views on the television series known as 
the 32d Day under PKK's influence. The people have been 
intimidated by the PKK. The political parties in power do not 
have any strength in this region. The PKK exists in this region 
and so does the NAP, which is a pro-state party. I have not 
been threatened. The PKK is unable to threaten me and my 
colleagues. It does not dare to do so. We have intimidated the 
PKK. We have informed the PKK militants that they are finished 
and that they will no longer be able to roam the mountains 
because we have arrived in the region." 
  Aksay is convinced that the idealist movement will achieve 
success in the local elections, not only in Diyarbakir but also 
in every part of southeastern Turkey, without any exception. 
Aksay accused his rivals of following in the wake of the PKK 
and said that the NAP is loyal to the state. Regarding the 
effort made to end bloodshed in the region, he said that the NAP 
is the most determined political party in that regard. 
  Of course, Aksay's views have brought up the question of 
which "horse" the government will bet on in southeastern Turkey. 
It is a fact that the government moved to convene the Religious 
Council and underline the view that the "call for prayers cannot 
be abandoned and the banner has to be kept hoisted" 70 years 
after the establishment of the Republic in the country. It is 
also a fact that the government allowed the Prosperity Party to 
intensify its activities some time ago. It now seems that it 
has moved to facilitate NAP's initiatives. Is all this an 
indication that the effort to resolve the problems in 
southeastern Turkey is only aimed at finding a "military 
solution?" 
  NAP's Viewpoint: The NAP members are convinced that the 
Prosperity Party has lost its strength in southeastern Turkey. 
NAP Deputy Leader Riza Muftuoglu has said that the Prosperity 
Party will only be an insignificant problem for the NAP because 
the representatives of the Kurdish citizens in the region have 
asked the party to help them. Muftuoglu claimed the following: 
"We are being pressed by the Prosperity Party in various areas. 
That party is ahead of the NAP in Mus. However, it is behind 
our party in Bingol. It is losing its strength every day. We 
could have all of that party's votes if the elections were to be 
held a month later. We have received very favorable reports 
from southeastern Turkey. The NAP stands to win the elections 
in almost all the provinces in the region." [passage omitted] 
  It is true that Turkey is marking the religious festival at 
the present time. However, is that a sufficient reason for the 
people in southeastern Turkey to decide to embrace the NAP? 
Ismet Imset, editor of the TURKISH DAILY NEWS replied to that 
question as follows: The NAP is supported by only a small group 
in southeastern Turkey. However, it stands a good chance of 
winning the elections if the people comply with the PKK's ban 
and boycott the voting. 
  Stressing that the NAP will take over the mayoralties in at 
least two provinces, Imset warned that tensions will escalate in 
that region if the NAP wins in areas in which the Hizbullah 
groups are strong. 
  Imset also claimed that the NAP is supported by the police 
organization, the special teams, and several local tribes. The 
fact that Abdulkerim Tatar, who is the NAP mayoral candidate 
from Sirnak, is a member of the renowned Tatar Tribe confirms 
Imset's viewpoint. Tatar has claimed that the NAP is quickly 
gaining strength in Sirnak and stressed that a move by the PKK 
to direct pressure against him is out of the question. He also 
claimed that the PKK threat in Sirnak has nearly disappeared and 
urged journalists to visit the town to establish the true state 
of affairs. [passage omitted] 
  The NAP members wholeheartedly trust their party and 
believe that through its approach the most rational solutions 
can be found to the problems in southeastern Turkey In fact, 
they have ignored PKK threats and pressures and seem to have 
declared a "state of emergency" and "mobilization" for 
themselves in that region. The NAP mayoral candidate 
unconditionally support the concept of a "military solution" and 
maintain the view that the Kurds and the Turks are brothers but 
terrorists must be given a deserved lesson. Hamza Ugurlu, NAP 
mayoral candidate in Bitlis, has said that the PKK is an enemy 
of the Kurds and Turks, who have lived like brothers for many 
centuries. He described the PKK as a dirty organization that 
has contaminated the region. [passage omitted] 
  Conditions in the region have made the NAP's grass roots 
adopt a radical approach. The NAP members have even ignored the 
murder of the head of the party organization in Genc district 
some time ago. Ismet Imset and several other observers have 
warned that tensions will escalate if the NAP mayoral candidate 
win the elections in the region. They have also claimed that 
the NAP receives significant support from a number of mechanisms 
in the state's structure. However, Riza Muftuoglu has refuted 
that viewpoint and noted that the NAP is supported by the people 
and not by certain mechanisms in the state's structure. 
Asserting that the success the NAP will achieve in southeastern 
Turkey will be a turning point for the country, Muftuoglu argued 
that certain forces, which wish to obstruct the establishment of 
tranquillity, are trying to mislead the people on the views of 
several NAP candidates. [passage omitted] 
  When the situation of the idealists in southeastern Turkey 
is 
viewed, the Great Unity Party [GUP], which was established by a 
group that splintered from the NAP, also has to be considered. 
Opposed to NAP's support for a radical pro-Turkish and pro-state 
military solution to the problem in southeastern Turkey, the 
party will contest the elections in all the provinces in the 
region, supporting the concept of "the establishment of a 
civilian community and Islamic brotherhood." The GUP is 
regarded as the favored political party in several areas. 
  The GUP mayoral candidate in Mus, Sirnak, Bitlis, and 
Adiyaman are confident that they will win the elections. 
Compared with NAP mayoral candidates, their approach is not as 
inflexible and radical. They have said that they have been 
threatened by the PKK, as have the mayoral candidates of other 
political parties. However, they stressed that they have 
ignored the threats. The GUP mayoral candidates are convinced 
that bloodshed can be avoided with an honest administration and 
forbearance. [passage omitted] 
  GUP's Viewpoint: GUP leader Muhsin Yazicioglu has said that 
his party is confident that it will achieve success in the 
elections in southeastern Turkey and win in Sirnak in 
particular. He also said that his party will benefit from 
Islam's uniting nature and try to resolve the PKK problem in the 
region. 
  The fact that the NAP and GUP have gained strength in 
southeastern Turkey indicates that balances will change after 
the local elections on 27 March. The NAP's extreme pro-state 
and pro-Turkish views, the NAP leader's claim that his party 
will resolve the PKK problem in southeastern Turkey in six 
months, and the claims that the NAP is supported by the village 
guards and state mechanisms have clarified the approach the 
government has adopted on the Kurdish problem. Nevertheless, 
the fact that two former NAP mayors, who held office in Bingol 
prior to the military takeover on 12 September 1980, have been 
killed has led observers to ask the following: How will the 
people in southeastern Turkey react to a possible NAP victory in 
the elections? How will the NAP emerge from the elections in 
the region? Will bloodshed end if the NAP wins? Will the NAP 
become an official side in the clash between the state forces 
and the PKK? Will the PKK use NAP's radical approach to gain 
advantages in international platforms? The outcome of the 
elections on 27 March will clarify these questions.

  [Text] Continuing an official visit to Germany, Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar' met with Federal Economics Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt in Bonn this morning. Also present were members 
of the Syrian delegation and top officials of the German 
Economics Ministry, as well as the Syrian and German ambassadors 
in Bonn and Damascus. 
  They looked into ways to deepen and expand cooperation and 
friendship between Syria and Germany in various fields in the 
best interests of the two countries. The German minister called 
relations between Syria and Germany old and historic. Al-shar's 
visit to Germany, he added, should help strengthen these ties. 
He emphasized that Syria plays a significant role in the Middle 
East. The German minister said his country was willing to help 
Syria's economic development by upgrading bilateral cooperation. 
  For his part, al-Shar' reviewed Middle East political 
developments. He pointed to the role Syria is playing under 
President al-Asad in efforts to promote a just and comprehensive 
peace predicated on UN resolutions and international legitimacy 
so as to bring about security and stability -- the basic 
requirements for economic and social development in Syria and 
the region. 
  This morning, al-Shar' received Mr. (Hans Sherkin), head of 
the foreign relations commitee at the German parliament. 
Al-Shar's delegation was also present as were the Syrian and 
German ambassadors in Bonn and Damascus. They reviewed Middle 
East developments and bilateral ties. 
  Also this morning, al-Shar' held a news conference to mark 
his official visit to Germany at which he took questions from 
foreign, German, and Arab correspondents about his talks in 
Germany. 
  Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel last night hosted a 
dinner for al-Shar' and his delegation, also attended by German 
officials and top bureaucrats of the German Foreign Ministry, as 
well as the Syrian and German abmassadors in Bonn and Damascus. 
  Kinkel welcomed al-Shar' and told him he appreciated his 
taking up the invitation to visit Bonn during these critical 
circumstances in the Middle East. His speech noted the notable 
developments in relations between Syria and Germany. Kinkel 
stressed the need to hold further consultations and meetings to 
compare notes on issues of shared interest. He reitrated 
Syria's primary role in the region. The German minister called 
for the peace process to be restarted, given the difficult 
circmstances and impediments it is facing. The interests of 
Syria and Germany, he said, stand to gain from a successful 
peace process, since Middle Eastern and European peace, 
security, and stability are interdependent. Kinkel stressed 
that Germany and the European Union are determined to contribute 
to the establishment of a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace 
in the Middle East. He concluded his speech by saying that 
Syria is an important player in the Middle East. We want to be 
a dependable partner for Syria in Europe and the world, he added. 
  For his part, al-Shar' thanked Minister Kinkel for the 
hospitality and the opportunity he has been given to see German 
officials. Syria, al-Shar' added, is keen to deepen friendship 
and cooperatioan with Germany in all areas. He emphasized that 
his talks in Germany were good, constructive, and frank, and 
showed the two countries have deep-rooted ties of friendship and 
cooperation. Al-Shar' said Syria appreciated Germany's keenness 
to bring peace to the Middle East. He emphasized that a united 
Germany is bound to make an effective contribution to a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Al-Shar' said Syria is 
serious and sincere in pursuing the peace process in line with 
UN resolutions, the Madrid formula, and the land-for-peace 
principle. He stressed that an Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories is a must for the achievement of peace.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F>
Dietmar Timm; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Timm] There have often been some signs of peace 
in Bosnia. How serious are these signs this weekend [19-20 
March], in your view? 
  [Kinkel] There is, at least, a small ray of hope. 
Everything you mentioned before indicates the small but 
important steps forward have been possible, in particular the 
signing of the agreement between the Croats and the Bosnian 
Muslims in Washington last Thursday and Friday, which I 
attended. This was a first, important agreement between two of 
the three parties to the conflict, and the decisive thing now is 
-- and all participants agreed on that -- to include the third 
party, the Serbs. I hope this will be possible. 
  [Timm] How are the Serbs to be included? Serbian leader 
Karadzic has announced conditions -- the most important of them 
probably is the lifting of the UN sanctions so that, as he said, 
the Serbs can sit at the negotiating table with equal rights. 
Is this a condition that can be fulfilled? 
  [Kinkel] First of all, there are already talks. Of course, 
now it will be decisive how much influence the Russians can 
exert on the Serbian side in this connection. The basis of the 
Washington agreement was the European action plan, which, for 
its part, was based on the Kinkel-Juppe initiative, which, in 
the end, envisaged that the Serbian side would be promised a 
suspension of the sanctions -- not a lifting of the sanctions, 
but a suspension --if specific steps toward peace are taken 
beforehand. 
  The question of sanctions -- this is also something that we, 
as the European Union troika, extensively discussed with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and with all other foreign 
ministers present in Washington on Friday -- will now have to 
make a decisive contribution to whether progress is made. 
However, cautious action will be necessary in this respect. As 
I said, first the Serbian side must do something and only then 
can there be a suspension of very specific sanctions. 
  [Timm] The lifting of the blockade of the roads into Maglaj 
by the Serbs yesterday -- is this a concession that would be 
expected? 
  [Kinkel] In any case, it is a gratifying sign. Maglaj has 
been in a very, very difficult situation for months. You saw 
the pictures on television, how these convoys were received with 
joy. I can only say: Now, after the partial solution that has 
been achieved for Sarajevo -- we do not yet have a definite 
political solution there -- we must now try to extinguish the 
other sources of fire, so to speak, one after the other. This 
includes Maglaj. It also includes other towns that are besieged 
and difficult areas. 
  In addition to the political process, which now requires in 
particular the inclusion of the Serbs, we must try to come to 
grips with these other sources of fire in practice and, above 
all, gradually bring the humanitarian relief convoys to all 
those places where there is still terrible suffering. 
  [Timm] What role do the Europeans still play in this peace 
process? After all, one gets the impression that progress is 
mainly achieved through the mediation of the United States and 
Russia. 
  [Kinkel] This is certainly correct. It was very important 
that the Americans got more closely involved. However, the 
basis of the agreement achieved last weekend was the preparatory 
work done by the Europeans and also --something that is easily 
forgotten -- the preparatory work done by Lord Owen and Thorvald 
Stoltenberg. This means we are still massively involved in the 
process. 
  Above all, it will be necessary for the Europeans to be very 
closely involved in the implementation of a peace treaty. 
Therefore, on Friday we also talked about the fact that 
administration by the European Union is envisaged for Mostar, 
and we, the Germans, want to provide an administrator there. I 
discussed the matter once again with Mr. Tudjman and Mr. 
Izetbegovic on Friday. They are both still very much in favor of 
having the matter done in this way. 
  [Timm] Americans and Russians are also playing a similar 
role in the peace process in the Middle East. They are also 
godfathers of that peace process. Israel and the PLO have been 
talking to each other again since yesterday. The resumption of 
the official talks seems to be imminent. What are the prospects 
for peace like there? And here, too, the question: Which role 
can the Europeans play in this process? 
  [Kinkel] First of all, the Russians are not playing any 
decisive role in the Middle East process. It is, indeed, the 
Americans who are doing that. On 18 March the UN Security 
Council adopted a resolution on the terrible massacre in Hebron 
after more than three weeks of deliberations -- a resolution 
that contains a condemnation, an appeal to Israel to disarm the 
settlers, and a call on Israel to take measures to protect 
Palestinian civilians, including the international presence. In 
this connection, we, Europeans, will also participate. 
  However, in particular we also have the task of providing 
economic aid there. We have done that in the past and we are 
now doing that very strongly with our involvement in the 
occupied territories, bilaterally as Germans and, above all, 
also as the European Union. Large amounts of money have been 
provided. Now help must be provided in Gaza and in Jericho. 
That is, the Europeans are facing quite a lot there. 
  [Timm] Mr. Kinkel, there are prospects for peace in Bosnia 
-- even though they are vague -- and in the Middle East. Another 
hotbed of crisis brought itself to people's attention on the 
weekend, namely North Korea. The U.S. secretary of state now 
wants to come to trade sanctions in the UN Security Council. 
How explosive is the situation there, in your view? 
  [Kinkel] Well, what has happened there over the past few 
days is unpleasant. It is true that North Korea is not at all 
willing to join the Nonproliferation Treaty. On the contrary, 
threats have been voiced. This is alarming. It would be 
important that, above all, the Chinese, who have the greatest 
possibility to exert influence, get involved there strongly. Of 
course, it is also important that the UN Security Council 
discuss how the events that are on the horizon in this 
connection can be contained. I do not want to start speaking of 
the devil, but the development is quite certainly not gratifying. 
  [Timm] Mr. Kinkel, in conclusion one more question to the 
chairman of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. 
Yesterday there were local elections in Schleswig-Holstein. 
Once again, the FDP stayed below the 5-percent threshold at the 
land level -- it achieved 4.4 percent. A week ago, after the 
Landtag elections in Lower Saxony, you said that the FDP must 
simply get better. Does it have to get even better as a result 
of yesterday's elections? 
  [Kinkel] First of all, the result is not gratifying. There 
is no reason to whitewash anything. However, one must not 
overestimate local elections. One must understand that the free 
voters' associations have not achieved bad results there, as far 
as I can tell by the first reports. If one looks at the entire 
picture, we were able to stop a trend to a certain extent, which 
is doubtlessly not working for us at the moment. However, once 
again, this is not a gratifying result, but one must not 
overestimate it. 
  I am certain that the FDP will catch up again. We must do 
everything and roll up our sleeves so that this happens in 
practice. We will discuss this matter in the Presidium later 
today. I repeat that one must not lose one's calm and deviate 
from one's course now. At the moment we simply have problems 
also because everything that is not working in this country is 
blamed on those who are in the government in Bonn and we have to 
take the blame for some difficulties that exist objectively. 
  We will get out of this negative trend and will manage it. I 
am sure of that and, I say once again, one needs good nerves for 
that. On the weekend I attended two party congresses. Things 
will start moving upward again.

<F P=106> [Karl-Heinz Baum report: "Commitment to Friendship"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin, 20 Mar -- Following the latest irritations 
over critical statements by Francois Scheer, the French 
ambassador in Bonn, on German European Police, Paris and Bonn 
are intensively trying to limit the damage. On Saturday [19 
March] in Berlin FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], stressed the "friendly 
special relationship" between Germany and France. French 
President Francois Mitterrand told the AGENCE FRANCE PRESS (AFP) 
news agency: "We have cooperated with the chancellor in the 
best spirit and we shall continue to do so in the interest of 
both our countries and Europe." 
  In Berlin Kinkel said that this "extremely important" 
special 
relationship is and remains "Europe's central axis." The past 
has proven that in Europe much is possible if Germany and France 
cooperate, but only little if this relationship is disturbed. 
  "France can rely absolutely on Germany," Kinkel stressed. 
Solo actions are pointless, the Germans have to remember that. 
Germany does not want any prerogatives. Only together can the 
tasks that Europe is facing in the future be mastered. Kinkel 
noted that he was saying this in Berlin because in this city 
France defended the freedom of Germany and of the world for 
years. The FRG foreign minister announced a "long-planned visit 
to France." 
  At the land party congress of the Thuringian FDP, Kinkel 
said 
concerning the alleged statements by French Ambassador Francois 
Scheer about Kinkel's role in the negotiations for membership in 
the European Union with Scandinavian countries and Austria: If 
an ambassador says incorrect things, it must be possible to 
refute this quite clearly. He has advocated expansion to the 
north just as expansion to the south. 
  Kinkel also commented on the Bundeswehr. It must get out of 
the parties' quarrel and needs quiet for planning, financing, 
and organization. The FDP wants to prepare the Bundeswehr for 
peacekeeping and peacemaking tasks. This costs money. "This 
money must be available!"

<F P=106> ["mes/ub" report: "Clear Criticism of Kinkel's Crisis </F>
Management"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The crisis management of FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) in the 
affair involving German-French relations has led to a heated 
domestic quarrel. Both the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] leadership as well as the Christian Social Union accused 
Kinkel on Friday [18 March] of having overreacted by "summoning" 
French Ambassador Francois Scheer, thus damaging relations 
between Bonn and Paris. Kinkel, on the other hand, said in an 
interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that German-French relations 
are "of utmost and primary importance." After difficult years 
Bonn and Paris have found a special relationship of a friendly 
nature. This must be preserved at any cost. The German-French 
relationship is of utmost importance for Europe. "I will not 
permit any shadow to fall on that," Kinkel said. 
  Deputy SPD Chairman Oskar Lafontaine -- commissioner for the 
cultivation of German-French cultural relations -- said that the 
tensions that have now erupted between Paris and Bonn have been 
building for some time. Since the fall of the Wall in 1989 the 
Federal Government has made "several serious mistakes" in its 
European policy, he said in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG. "We must make efforts to again improve the relationship 
with Paris." As an example Lafontaine cited the fact that in 
1989 Chancellor Helmut Kohl had not coordinated his 10-point 
catalogue on German unification with French President Francois 
Mitterrand. "This was not in the spirit of the German-French 
treaty." 
  Later on, in the policy toward Yugoslavia or regarding 
questions of German financial policy, chancellor and foreign 
minister "did not exercise the necessary restraint and care in 
dealing with France," Lafontaine added. In the future important 
foreign policy decisions must "again be coordinated in the 
spirit of classical diplomacy and partnership." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["C.G." report: "French Ambassador Also Commented to Mrs. </F>
Schwaetzer"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 18 Mar -- Before his conversation with 
journalists in Bonn, which led to the diplomat being summoned to 
the Foreign Ministry, the French ambassador to Germany, Scheer, 
made similar comments on German-French relations to FRG Minister 
Schwaetzer. Upon reading the first report by this newspaper on 
comments "by French circles," the minister recognized the 
contents of the comments, which Scheer made to her during his 
first visit as new French ambassador in her office in the FRG 
Construction Ministry. This became known in Bonn on Friday [18 
March]. 
  In the meantime, it has been heard in Bonn that, 
occasionally, one can sense uneasiness in Paris about the fact 
that France's influence might decrease as a result of the 
expansion of the European Union. However, differences between 
the concepts of Germany and France do not touch the substance of 
German-French cooperation, because the French Government has 
officially approved all joint actions, it was said. 
  Mr. Lamers, the foreign policy spokesman of the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, stated 
that the behavior of the French ambassador was unusual and, 
concerning the diplomat's summons to the Foreign Ministry, he 
said: "One reacts with appropriate measures to unusual steps." 
However, one must not simply brush aside the concerns and 
complaints voiced by Scheer. If Germany takes the wrong steps, 
it could "easily find itsel standing alone." The foreign 
minister must take into account that self-assurance and 
self-confidence must be linked with caution and care. Perhaps 
this has not always been exercised to the necessary extent, 
Lamers said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["ub" commentary: "A Loud Word at the Right Time"] </F>
  [Text] After the storm in a tea cup over Klaus Kinkel's 
language in Brussels, one now has a clear view of what French 
Ambassador Francois Scheer intended with his attack on the 
German foreign minister. He wanted what one expects least of an 
ambassador and what, therefore, was a sensation: to sound the 
alarm as loudly as possible. He has achieved that. The 
question of knowledgeable people whether he had acted upon 
whisperings from the Elysee Palace or the Quai d'Orsay or 
whether he broke all the rules of diplomacy on his own account 
is secondary, no matter how interesting it may be to those 
affected. 
  Obviously, a rules violation was necessary to tear through 
the veil of a cover-up. It is true: Germans and French are 
having a row. Neither Bonn nor Paris are capable of coming to 
grips with the new state of affairs. The political class in 
France is unable to accept that the central location of the 
larger Germany means an increase in power in an expanded 
European Union. How nice it was when the just semisovereign 
neighbor had to cling to Paris' coat-tails. 
  German foreign policy is in danger of underestimating how 
strongly the ghosts of the past are still haunting Europe. It 
must not overlook how difficult it is for neighbors in the west 
and in the south to stomach the relativization of their 
importance. The Germans are the ones who have benefited most 
from the end of the Cold War and now also from Europe's growing 
together. Anyone who is so enormously lucky should keep alive 
all the sensitivity of which he is capable to correctly 
understand the nervousness to the west of the Rhine and 
alleviate it in time.

  [Text] Deggendorf (DDP/ADN) -- The 250 delegates of the 
"party miniconference" of the CSU [Christian Social Union] has 
adopted the party's manifesto on the elections to the European 
Parliament, with one vote against. The strategy paper lays down 
the critical stance of the CSU on European integration, which in 
their view is proceeding too fast. There will be no federal 
Europe with the CSU. Rather, the party sees its task as being to 
restrict the "presumptuous centralism and rampant bureaucracy" 
of Brussels. 
  The CSU agreed to European integration in principle. The 
European Union is seen as being in the interest of Bavaria and 
Germany. However, efforts will have to be made in the future to 
ensure that burdens are shared more fairly and Germany is freed 
from the role of Euro-financier. The introduction of a European 
currency is also viewed with skepticism. The CSU puts stability 
before speed, the position paper says. There will only be a 
European currency if it is as stable as the German mark. 
  The CSU wants to see the subsidiary principle realized in a 
"Europe of regions." Brussels must only be given responsibility 
for areas that cannot be settled at the national level. This 
applies to foreign and security policy, the fight against 
organized crime, approaches to the influx of asylum-seekers and 
refugees, and transport and environmental issues.

Germans Also in 1994"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 18 Mar -- Despite all the 
difficulties, Bonn and Moscow agree that cooperation to solve 
the problems of Russian Germans is to be continued in 1994. 
This was announced by Horst Waffenschmidt, the Federal 
Government's resettler commissioner, upon inquiry on Friday [18 
March]. The parliamentary state secretary in the FRG Interior 
Ministry summarized the results of the meeting of the 
German-Russian government Committee that recently took place in 
Bonn, chaired by himself and by Russian Nationalities Policy 
Minister Shakhray. 
  The Committee set down the direction of future activities. 
The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] politician noted that it 
is primarily important to "create a stable and generally 
favorable sociopolitical situation in their compact settlement 
areas and places for resettlement in Russia" for Russian Germans 
who want to stay in Russia. A first step toward fulfilling 
President Yeltsin's decree "on immediate measures to 
rehabilitate the Russian Germans," has been made by establishing 
national local councils and self-administration organs in the 
Kamyshin rayon (Volgograd area) and in the Engels rayon (Saratov 
area). It is a step on the path toward the goal of 10 July 1992 
of implementing the "protocol on cooperation between the 
government of the Russian Federation and the government of the 
FRG with the aim of gradually reestablishing the Russian 
Germans' state." According to Waffenschmidt, it was helpful 
that the Russian Government has now put together a "package of 
juridical documents" about the legal status of a national okrug, 
rayon, and national local councils and presented it to the 
Russian Federation Assembly ("Upper House"). 
  The Russian nationalities policy minister explained his 
"concept of a bilateral program for the development of the 
Russian Germans' culture" as well as a draft of the "federal 
program for the reestablishment and development of the system of 
steady national formation of Russian Germans and the first steps 
for its implementation by the year 2000." Agreement has been 
achieved on discussing the proposals of the Russian 
Nationalities Policy Ministry at a special meeting of the 
German-Russian Cultural Cooperation Committee in Bonn on 20 and 
21 April, with the participation of representatives of the 
Russian Germans' organizations. 
  Waffenschmidt added that both partners welcomed ideas for 
the 
Russian Germans' self-organization, which are aimed at the 
confirmation and official Russian recognition of their national 
and cultural character. This applies, above all, to the "German 
People's Assembly," some kind of Russian-German parliament. The 
People's Assembly should participate in specifying forms of 
national-cultural autonomy and the development of the Russian 
Germans' self-administration organs. Bonn will give priority 
support to a Russian-German administration college, which is on 
the point of being established.

  Waffenschmidt said that it was noted with satisfaction that 
Moscow registers positive investment results for Russian-German 
joint ventures, expressed in a clear increase in the financing 
volume. For 1994 the Russian budget allocates 39 billion rubles 
(39 billion marks) to projects for the benefit of Russian 
Germans; the budget of the German Interior Ministry allocates 65 
million marks to this purpose. The regional development 
societies in the German national rayon of Asovo (Omsk area) and 
in the German national rayon of Halberstadt in the Altai area 
have proved their worth. Bonn and Moscow agreed to examine the 
resettlement project in Nashchokovo (Tomsk area) with the aim of 
implementing it as soon as possible if the result of the study 
is positive. Russia's federal immigration authority wants to 
provide financial means for this purpose. In addition, it is 
useful to intensify measures that promote the Russian Germans' 
own initiative. This is to be achieved by granting low interest 
loans for the construction of owner-occupied houses and for the 
establishment of small and medium-sized companies (loans for 
setting up new business). 
  Waffenschmidt also stated that for him the promotion of 
church centers is an important element in the work of Russian 
Germans. In Omsk the Hannover Evangelical-Lutheran Land Church 
and the FRG Interior Ministry are supporting the construction of 
an Evangelical church center. In addition to church rooms, 
meeting places for young people and senior citizens as well as 
rooms for charitable work are being built. The church center in 
Omsk will become a cultural center for the 500,000 Russian 
Germans in western Siberia. Together with Land Bishop Hirschler 
from Hannover, he, Waffenschmidt, will inaugurate the center in 
the summer. In Marx (formerly Katharinenstadt) on the Volga, 
Cardinal Sterzinsky, the bishop of Berlin, inaugurated the 
Catholic church center last year. Many descendants of the Volga 
Germans, who settled in the area of Saratov, have found a new 
spiritual home in this church center. 
  Upon the request of the Russian Lutheran Church and the FRG 
government, the city has once again made St. Peter's Church in 
St. Petersburg available to the Evangelical church. In 
communist times a swimming pool had been built there. 
Waffenschmidt said that gradually "St. Peter's church is to be 
expanded into a church center and a cultural center, in 
cooperation between the Evangelical church and the FRG 
government." In the view of the CDU politician, the meeting of 
Russian Germans and their non-German neighbors is to be 
particularly promoted in the above-mentioned church centers. 
Upon his urging, three church centers have already held 
ecumenical services with Evangelical, Catholic, and Russian 
Orthodox clergy.

<F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at German-Baltic </F>
Consultations in Bonn-Bad Godesberg on 9 March 1994] 
  [Text] Dear colleagues; I am very pleased to welcome you 
to our consultations here in Bonn today, and I am grateful that 
you have accepted my invitation so quickly. 
  When I decided to propose German-Baltic consultations I was 
well aware of the fact that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are 
in many respects quite different from one another. 
Nevertheless, I think that there are a number of important 
issues that concern all of the Baltic states and that are also 
of special importance to Germany. There are four areas in 
particular that we should discuss in detail today: 
  -- The relations of the Baltic states with Russia; 
  -- Moving closer to the European Union [EU] and the Western 
European Union [WEU]; 
  -- Moving closer to the European-Atlantic security 
structures; 
  -- Baltic cooperation. 
  Let me make a few introductory remarks before we begin the 
discussion. 
  One: Germany has a particularly close relationship with the 
Baltic states and Russia in many respects. For this reason and 
because the Baltic have always been a yardstick for European 
stability, we are interested in consolidating Baltic-Russian 
relations. Germany, together with its Western partners, has 
always advocated an unconditional withdrawal of former Soviet 
troops from the Baltic. We have recently reiterated this 
commitment by participating in the U.S.-Latvian negotiations to 
achieve a compromise on the Russian radar station at Skrunda. 
There must be no further doubt about the final withdrawal of 
Russian troops by 31 August 1994, leaving only the troops 
required for operating the Skrunda installation. There is no 
reason for making the withdrawal subject to any conditions, 
either. 
  Another open question is the status of the Russian-speaking 
population, especially in Estonia and Latvia. This aspect is of 
utmost importance for future relations with Russia. The Baltic 
states deserve credit for their human rights policy, which has 
been acknowledged by the CSCE and the Council of Europe. On the 
other hand, the CSCE and the Council of Europe have found open 
points regarding the future status of the Russian-speaking 
population, which must be solved by a flexible and pragmatic 
approach. We are well aware of the historic reasons for the 
existing problems. Yet: Political reality tells us that there 
is no alternative to integrating the Russians who want to stay 
in Estonia and Latvia. This requires, however, that the 
Russian-speaking population demonstrates its will to be 
integrated by behaving accordingly. 
  Together with its Western partners, Germany supports all 
measures contributing to a long-term stabilization of 
Baltic-Russian relations. With this in mind, I do hope that 
both sides will make use of the opportunities for consolidation 
that will arise after the troops have pulled out. This also 
applies to the restructuring of trade relations. There are good 
opportunities for the Baltic states to act as a link between the 
Central and North East European states on the one hand, and 
Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine on the other. 
  Two: Since they regained independence, it has been a special 
concern of German foreign policy to get the Baltic states closer 
to the European Union and the WEU. This policy is based on the 
insight that the Baltic is part of Central and North Eastern 
Europe in political, geographical, and cultural terms. On the 
other hand, by moving the Baltic states closer to the European 
Union and WEU we want to emphasize that they are irreversibly 
linked to Europe and we want to open up new markets in the West 
for them. Urged by Germany, the EU Council gave the Commission 
a mandate for negotiating a free trade agreement with the Baltic 
states on 7 February, which is to contain a perspective for 
membership. 
  During its EU presidency in the second half of this year, 
Germany will do everything it can to create the right conditions 
for concluding an association agreement. At the same time, we 
are trying to get the Baltic states closer to the WEU, the 
European Union's defense policy component. It is our aim to 
include the Baltic states in an improved security policy status. 
  Three: We are working toward an all-European security 
structure based on trust and cooperation between equal partners. 
It is to safeguard security, including that of the Baltic 
states. An important step in this direction is NATO's 
Partnership for Peace offer, which you immediately accepted. 
The CSCE is also of great importance. The opportunities 
offered by preventive diplomacy within the CSCE have been shown 
by the activities of the CSCE Commissioner for National 
Minorities and the CSCE long-term mission to Estonia. We are, 
therefore, pleased that such a mission will also open in Latvia 
shortly. 
  An important precondition for the functioning of the CSCE 
and 
the all-European structure is the inclusion of Russia. Taking 
account of Russian security interests and Russia's active 
participation in the CSCE does not mean that the idea of special 
spheres of interest is accepted. Such concepts are by no means 
acceptable to us and are expressly rejected by us and our 
partners in the alliance. 
  Four: The Baltic Sea links Germany, the Baltic states, and 
Russia in a special way. After the end of the Cold War, chances 
for a cooperation creating peace and prosperity in the Baltic 
Sea area are better than they have been for a long time. 
Cooperation within the Council of Foreign Ministers of the 
Baltic Sea States, chaired by Estonia, has developed in a very 
positive way. With the third meeting of foreign ministers of 
the Baltic Sea Council approaching, we should consider ways of 
making future Baltic Sea cooperation as vivid and full of 
perspectives as it has been up to now. 
  Dear colleagues, I suggest that we now start the discussion 
on your countries' relations with Russia and I ask colleague 
Adrejevs to open the discussion.

<F P=106> [Markus Lesch report: "In the Throes of Crime"] </F>
  [Text] International crime is gaining increasing control 
over Germany's eastern neighbors. Organized crime is 
establishing itself in Poland and the Czech Republic along its 
path to Western markets, with Germany as the objective. The 
eastern laender can feel this already. 
  "In those countries, organized crime wants to earn its fare 
to come to Germany, so to speak, and is establishing permanent 
infrastructures there," said Saxony's Interior Minister Heinz 
Eggert at an international conference on internal security in 
Dresden. 
  "Western European crime is quickly spreading to the East," 
warned the president of the Czech Criminal Police Colonel Jan 
Vaculik. The most significant organized crime rings in the 
Czech Republic are groups of people from the Russophone area. 
"These groups are virtually impossible to overcome. They 
enforce silence with brutal methods, similar to those used by 
the Mafia in relation to the Omerta," Vaculik explained. 
  Contacts between this "Russo-Mafia" and Italian groups have 
been documented. Crime bosses from Naples and Moscow have 
already met in Prague in order to organize the smuggling of 
cocaine. The strongest Italian group is the notorious Camorra 
from Naples. Vaculik: "We have information that the Camorra 
wants to expand even further, to Russia and Estonia." 
  The third organized crime group consists of the Chinese 
"Flying Dragons" and "K-14" from New York, who extort protection 
money and deal in transfers of human cargo from the Far East to 
Germany and Western Europe. 
  Warnings signals are also coming from Poland, especially 
regarding drugs. "Poland has become a laboratory for synthetic 
drugs," says Janusz Wolny of the Polish Interior Ministry. "In 
addition, there are increasing quantities of cocaine from South 
America; heroin from the Near, Middle, and Far East; and 
marijuana from Africa." The quantity of drugs seized in 1993 
was double the 1992 figure. 
  The brutality of the criminal elements is growing at an 
alarming rate. In 1993, in fights alone, there were 185 heavy 
offenses, including 56 homicides, 31 kidnappings, and 38 attacks 
with firearms or grenades. 
  Even in Dresden, a hand grenade blew up in front of a police 
precinct. "The violence is going to get even bigger because of 
the involvement of criminal groups from CIS and the Czech 
Republic on the prostitution scene," warns Peter Raisch, 
president of the Saxon Criminal Office. 
  The Mafia lawyer Teresa Principato from Palermo confirmed 
the 
growing interest of Italian crime groups in East Europe and the 
German market. "Eastern Germany is a favorite place for money 
laundering," she said. "The police forces of the different 
laender appreciate the importance of international cooperation 
to fight crime. Now is the time for politics to follow suit," 
said Italy's best-known Mafia expert.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "Warning of Islamic Attacks"] </F>
  [Text] German security services have strengthened their 
protection of Jewish and Israeli facilities in the Federal 
Republic. 
  The reason for this is the massacre of more than 30 Arabs by 
a Jewish settler in Hebron. From the German angle, the massacre 
is considered "a particularly serious and inhuman occurrence" 
because the victims were Muslims in the midst of religious 
festivities. 
  The "Islamic resistance movement" Hamas, one of the leading 
extremist Palestinian groups, has already announced vengeance 
for Hebron. The Islamic fundamentalists have said that the 
Hebron massacre is the "last nail in the coffin of the autonomy 
agreement." 
  Therefore, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution 
has produced an analysis warning the federation and the laender 
of a "medium to long-term increased risk to security in Germany." 
  The analysis says that "because the terror potential is 
incalculable and arbitrary, attacks by opponents to the 
PLO-Israeli agreement could spread beyond the region at any 
time, possibly to Germany as well." 
  Therefore in Western Europe there is a particular danger of 
"spontaneous actions by fanatical lone-wolves from the Islamic 
region." This also applies to the Federal Republic where, 
according to the experts in the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, violent actions by "irrational individuals" are 
also to be expected in the short term. 
  Jewish and Israeli facilities are considered primary targets 
for such actions. But, says the analysis, the Islamic 
organizations active in Germany, the ones most expected to carry 
out acts of violence, still do not have the necessary 
infrastructure to carry out a rapid and organized strike. 
  According to the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, there are some 1,640 supporters of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and Schi'ite extremist 
Party of God (Hizballah) active in Germany. Just like the 
dissident organizations that oppose the PLO, these groups want 
to revert to an armed struggle with Israel.

  [Text] Germany -- the country of terrorism: Of 22,870 
politically motivated crimes, 1,402 (in 1993) are credited to 
foreigners. This is revealed by a secret report for the Federal 
Government. There were 99 attacks on individuals; eight people 
were killed. Furthermore, there were 86 arson attacks and five 
bomb attacks. The constitutional protection authorities 
estimate that 39,800 of about 6.5 million foreigners who live in 
Germany belong to extremist associations. According to the 
report, the most dangerous of these organizations is the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan], which is banned in Turkey.

<F P=106> ["fz" report: "RAF -- The CDU Puts Up a Front Against the </F>
Justice Minister"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] has 
categorically rejected the demands of FRG Justice Minister 
Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP], that politics must look for reconciliation with 
the Red Army Faction (RAF). "Terrorists are criminals. They 
must be treated like criminals," Johannes Gerster, deputy 
chairman of the CDU/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, told 
DIE WELT. "Anyone who commits murder and acts of terrorism 
cannot expect special treatment." 
  The justice minister had repeated the position, which is 
often voiced by the FDP, at the inauguration of Chief Federal 
Prosecutor Nehm. Gerster countered that in particular the head 
of the Justice Ministry should "not" turn the treatment of 
criminals "into a media spectacle." The state is in danger of 
making itself an "ally" of violent criminals. 
  In dealing with terrorists, too, law and order, which keep 
the door back into society open for everyone, must be the 
state's maxims for action. Since the RAF has affirmed that it 
intends to continue its fight against society, all means of law 
and order must be used against it also in the future, Gerster 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/CSU </F>
Bundestag group, by Klaus-Peter Siegloch in Bonn on 20 March -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Siegloch] Mr. Schaeuble, the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU] defeat in Hannover showed that the results of the 
polls were rather close to those of the elections. The CDU is 
currently getting somewhere around 35 percent nationwide. How 
and when do you want to turn the trend around for the elections 
in October? 
  [Schaeuble] First of all, it is important that we have made 
good progress with our policy. The German mark is stable, the 
economy is recovering again. This will also have an effect on 
the labor market, even though with a certain delay. We have 
made good progress with European unification; internal security 
is improving. Now we have to make the people aware of all these 
successes. These successes must become clearer. We are working 
on that. 
  [Siegloch] You have only seven months left. 
  [Schaeuble] Yes, but the polls have improved over the past 
months, even though they are not yet good. If they continue to 
improve by two percentage points per month over the next few 
months, we will get quite a good election result. 
  [Siegloch] What is your target corridor? Do you say 40 or 
41 percent? 
  [Schaeuble] No. Just do some calculations. We are now at 
about 35 percent, we have another seven months with 2 percent 
each -- that adds up to quite a good result. 
  [Siegloch] Then you would have the absolute majority. This 
is utopia. 
  [Schaeuble] I do not want to frighten anyone. But, of 
course, we have the expectations of getting clearly above 40 
percent. Then we will have a majority for the continuation of 
the coalition. 
  [Siegloch] However, on this certainly difficult path you are 
not getting much help from the Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] at the moment. The FDP is plagued by existential fear, 
and they even hesitate to make a clear coalition statement for 
the benefit of the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU]. Would it 
not be time to do that, in your view? 
  [Schaeuble] If we present the successes of our joint work 
together and continue to work cohesively for them, which the 
voters, who gave us the assignment of government, expect from 
us, the voters will reward the CDU/CSU and the FDP. I am quite 
sure of that. Lower Saxony shows that uncertainty about the 
future path is most disastrous for the FDP. Therefore, I would 
always advise jointly advocating the cohesiveness of the 
coalition during this legislative period and beyond that. This 
is most convincing. 
  [Siegloch] This means that you expect a statement on the 
coalition soon? 
  [Schaeuble] I would advise the FDP not to let uncertainty 
grow any further. This can only be to the detriment of the FDP, 
and we are not interested in that. 
  [Siegloch] Also regarding the presidential elections, the 
FDP might clarify the matter beforehand, but it deliberately 
keeps all avenues open. What is going to happen? Will Helmut 
Kohl throw the FDP out of the coalition if Johannes Rau is 
elected president with the votes of the FDP? 
  [Schaeuble] The question is so hypothetical that I can 
hardly think of an answer. I am quite confident that Roman 
Herzog will be elected. The FDP has put up Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher 
as a candidate. It is completely all right that it is 
advocating her election. If this is not successful, we will 
see. I am certain that the cohesiveness of the coalition will 
also be shown at the Federal Convention, and I am quite 
confident that Roman Herzog will be elected. 
  [Siegloch] Work, work, work -- with this program Rudolf 
Scharping wants to win the elections. Unemployment continues to 
rise in Germany. The voters no longer think that the coalition 
is competent to solve this most important issue. Obviously, the 
government plans have not been successful so far, at least they 
have not met with a positive response from the voters. Do you 
still have something new up your sleeve? 
  [Schaeuble] I would like to point out that things are 
improving in the polls. It is quite clear that we can achieve 
economic growth only by strengthening the leeway for private 
initiative and voluntary solidarity. We must rely on modern 
technology. All these are things that the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] refuses. These things cannot be done 
with the SPD and the Greens at all. We do not need even higher 
taxes and fees, as the SPD demands, but we must gradually reduce 
the state quota again, which is our policy. 
  The alternatives are quite clear. If we continue to strangle 
the economy more and more, if we continue to restrict it, we 
will not have growth and we will not get additional jobs. We 
must rely on strengthening the growth forces, and this is the 
precondition for achieving our goal of creating work for 
everyone. This is what we are working for. 
  However, this cannot be achieved just by talking, but by 
specific decisions. And in this connection we always have the 
problem that the SPD reject such decisions in the Bundestag and 
try to block them with their majority in the Bundesrat. 
  [Siegloch] Let us see whether the voters are going to accept 
this message. Thank you very much, Mr. Schaeuble.

<F P=106> ["hll" report: "SPD Wants To Be `Protective Power'"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 18 Mar -- In their draft of a government 
program, which was presented on Friday [18 March], the Social 
Democrats present themselves as a "strong protective power" for 
the social interests of families and for those at a material 
disadvantage, in particular in eastern Germany. In addition, 
they announce that they will act against disturbances of 
peaceful coexistence with "determination and consistency." 
  In order to combat organized crime, the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] wants to have assets impounded if there 
"is the urgent and justified suspicion that they come from 
serious crime or are to be used for such crimes, unless the 
owner proves the opposite." If all other methods fail, the 
authorities "must have the right to mount microphones in 
apartments and to record conversations," which, however, is to 
be linked with strict preconditions. 
  The SPD also wants to "strengthen the presence of police in 
streets and squares." Combating right-wing extremism as well as 
the integration of foreigners are cited as focal issues. 
  Regarding energy policy, the draft program sticks to the 
goal 
of opting out of nuclear energy, but it does not give a schedule 
for it: "We want to set a course toward opting out of nuclear 
energy by replacing the nuclear law with a further developed law 
on opting out of nuclear energy." Just as the current coalition 
government, the SPD wants to reduce the emission of carbon 
dioxide by one-fourth by the year 2005. German hard coal and 
brown coal are to be used as ongoing energy supplies and the use 
of hard coal is to be financially secured also beyond the year 
2000. 
  As for foreign policy, Germany's coresponsibility for 
worldwide problems is stressed under the keyword "partnership 
for development and peace." The draft notes: "No Bundeswehr 
participation in wars" but only in peacekeeping and humanitarian 
missions. It demands "restrictive European arms export 
controls." Europe must become an "environmental and social 
union." 
  The government program will be finally adopted by the SPD 
congress in Halle on 22 June. The authors of the draft, the 
size of which has doubled compared with earlier versions, are 
convinced that the majority of the party agrees with their 
statements.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Leader Rudolf Scharping by Dieter Buhl </F>
and Werner A. Perger; place and date not given: "I Can Do It 
Better"] 
  [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Minister-president, Lower Saxony was a 
good start for the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] in 
this year of many elections. Are Gerhard Schroeder and his 
red-green coalition the only midwives of this victory or did you 
and a somewhat calmer SPD also play a part in it? 
  [Scharping] First of all, it was a success for the SPD in 
Lower Saxony and for Gerhard Schroeder in particular. The fact 
that the SPD has become more stable at the federal level 
certainly did not do any harm. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Gains were made by the Greens above all. Does 
that mean that the party is now a possible Bonn coalition 
partner for the SPD? 
  [Scharping] To my mind, the central political signal at the 
federal level sent by the Lower Saxony Landtag elections is that 
the SPD has remained stable and it has increased its lead over 
the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] from 2 percent to almost 8 
percent. 
  [DIE ZEIT] An increase in your share of the vote of 0.1 
percent, as the case in Lower Saxony, would not be of much 
benefit to you in the Bundestag elections. 
  [Scharping] The key point is the significantly greater lead 
over the CDU. That means that we can also increase our lead 
over the CDU at the federal level. The general lesson to be 
drawn from the election result is that annoyance with the 
parties is declining. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Following Hamburg and Lower Saxony, is the FDP 
[Free Democratic Party] still of interest to you as a coalition 
partner? 
  [Scharping] The FDP is losing its function as a party that 
can secure a majority and thus, it can be assumed that it has 
become a matter of greater urgency than ever before for the 
party to explain what liberalism actually means to it today. 
Nevertheless, the SPD conducts debates about the main tasks in 
German politics and not about coalitions. The offers that the 
SPD receives will certainly exceed demand. 
  [DIE ZEIT] What is striking about the SPD today is its 
exceptional openness. How did you manage that, Mr. Scharping? 
  [Scharping] Political goals and ideas are being debated much 
more intensely in the party. I personally have made an effort 
to ensure that we talk to each other rather than past each 
other. In addition, the "party ballot" sent positive shock 
waves through the SPD. Many who had previously taken part in 
key public debates realized that the same way of acting was not 
very responsible within the SPD and from the viewpoint of its 
political goals, and, thank heavens, they acted accordingly. 
When Social Democrats switch on their television sets in the 
evenings, they no longer have to be ashamed of news reports 
about what is going on in the SPD. That has a significant 
impact on the electorate. 
  Finally, the prospect of winning the 1994 Bundestag makes it 
easier to focus political attention on the most important 
programmatic points, and that is undoubtedly a further factor. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Perhaps this openness will cease when the debate 
about a program for the government begins. That will call for 
many sacrifices, including sacrifices among your own voters. 
  [Scharping] I think that political models geared solely 
toward redistribution and telling the other side what it must 
put up with are finished. We will place the justice angle very 
much at the forefront as well as the question of who has to make 
what contribution to the development of Germany, to its economic 
recovery, and to safeguarding Germany's welfare state and 
ecological principles. 
  [DIE ZEIT] So, in concrete terms, who is to be given what, 
and what is to be taken away from whom? 
  [Scharping] We are discussing the issue of how labor costs 
must be reduced and investment in new products and new jobs must 
be stepped up. That means that within the framework of the 
current taxes and dues burden, at the level that it will attain 
in 1995, which I believe should not be increased, there will 
have to be realignments. There has to be a reduction in the tax 
burden on middle and low incomes, if only because of the tax 
exemption -- provided for by the constitution -- of minimum 
incomes. In addition, for the development of Germany as a 
whole, burdens have to be distributed more fairly, which 
automatically makes a moderate increase in the taxation of 
particularly high incomes and wealth -- as in the United States 
-- necessary. The Federal Government wants to reintroduce the 
solidarity levy for this purpose. I think that a supplementary 
form of taxation would make more sense. If one wants to create 
more favorable conditions for investment, then one must 
simultaneously make raw materials and energy more expensive, 
which is also a key point for the ecological modernization of 
the economy. Environmental, information, and communications 
technologies, as well as rapid transportation systems -- for 
example cooperation with the French on the ICE and the TGV rail 
projects -- have a role to play. 
  [DIE ZEIT] So, you would not provide backing for the 
Transrapid rail project? 
  [Scharping] We will discuss that after Easter, without any 
reservations. The technology essentially merits such backing, 
but I do not think that the proposed route makes much sense. 
  [DIE ZEIT] No increases in taxes and contributions, no 
increase in public debt: Those are the so-called "main planks" 
of your government program. Will you manage to keep to that? 
There is criticism in your party. Ultimately, one knows that 
if the state makes cuts, they tend to affect the poorest the 
most. 
  [Scharping] First, as for taxation and contribution levels: 
In 1995, those will almost reach 50 percent and that will be a 
historically high level in Germany. It is a consequence of the 
Bonn coalition's orgy of tax hikes and a lack of discipline with 
regard to expenditure. If tax and other deductions account for 
between 48 and 49 percent of an average worker's wage that also 
affects the social acceptance of state activity, which is vital 
for civilized coexistence. It also affects acceptance of the 
social welfare system. 
  If the signals that employees receive from politics are, for 
example, that they must pay higher pension benefit contributions 
-- they will rise by 1.7 percent to 19.2 percent in 1994 -- but 
their pensions will not be certain, which is what Herr 
Biedenkopf said recently.... 
  [DIE ZEIT] And so did Mr. Lafontaine. 
  [Scharping] .... that affects the acceptance of common 
security in a welfare state. Of course, many employees ask 
themselves why the difference between their gross and net 
incomes is so high. 
  Here is a second example: The development of eastern Germany 
is to a large extent being financed from social insurance 
contributions. Why should employees who pay contributions and 
plants with high wage costs alone provide finance for the 
development of eastern Germany through pension funds and 
unemployment benefit funds? Would it not be more honest if it 
were to be done with the help of taxes so that everyone, 
including civil servants and the self-employed, made the same 
contribution? 
  [DIE ZEIT] It might be more honest, but probably more 
difficult to implement? 
  [Scharping] It is linked to the example that should be set 
by those who consider themselves to belong to elites and possess 
appropriate economic and financial resources. It is a question 
of justice and economic reason. Pushing up labor costs -- 
ancillary and supplementary costs -- to such high levels runs 
counter to economic reason. Plants with large work forces and 
payrolls bear a disproportionate burden as a result. It affects 
their competitiveness. 
  [DIE ZEIT] In your government program, do you define what a 
higher income is? 
  [Scharping] I do not consider that to be necessary. 
  [DIE ZEIT] But it is something that many people would like 
to know? 
  [Scharping] That may be so. However, the problem that we 
face is as follows: The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled 
that as of 1996, the legislature is obliged to ensure that the 
minimum level of income is exempt from tax. This must be 
accomplished with the help of a reform of the wage and income 
taxation scales and improved benefits for families with 
children. Once those two things have been accomplished, the 
rest is only a question of what the actual wage and income 
taxation scales will be. 
  [DIE ZEIT] And what does your government program say on that 
point? 
  [Scharping] As of 1 January 1995, the coalition wants to 
reintroduce a solidarity levy of 7.5 percent without the reform 
that I have described. Instead of that, what we want is a 
supplementary contribution of 10 percent, a tax exempt minimum 
income, and better conditions for families. Whoever is paying 
2,000 German marks [DM) in tax a month, can expect to pay 
DM2,200 over a certain period of time. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Thus, medium-sized business will be asked to pay 
up, because there are not that many rich people who could be 
fleeced of even more. 
  [Scharping] Reducing the taxation burden on investment and 
reducing the taxation burden on companies in so far as they 
invest and create new jobs is a priority. As for medium-sized 
business: In the case of the Law on Safeguarding Germany's 
Future as Center for Business, the SPD ensured that depreciation 
terms would not get worse. The SPD also participated in making 
the taxation of earnings from commercial activity lower. I 
consider that to be the right way. 
  I think that one has to always make very precise 
distinctions. What promotes the creation of jobs? What 
strengthens a company's own capital base? What facilitates 
investment? All this is in the corporate taxation field, and 
one has to distinguish that clearly from private income. I am 
of the opinion that following the Federal Constitutional Court 
ruling on exempting the minimum income from taxation and in view 
of the financial needs linked to the development of Germany, we 
cannot mislead people into believing that there are no limits to 
how much their incomes can grow and that such growth has no tax 
implications. That would be untrue. In the case of the 
taxation of private entrepreneurial earnings, I share the views 
of many entrepreneurs, including the views of Herr Necker or 
Herr Murmann: The higher taxation of profits that are withdrawn 
would be reasonable. 
  [DIE ZEIT] You do not want to say openly how much this is 
going to cost whom? 
  [Scharping] Why not? 
  [DIE ZEIT] You have not defined who the "better earners" 
that the SPD talks about so much are. 
  [Scharping] The term means that one could set a limit above 
which everyone has to make some contribution to the development 
of Germany, the preservation of social justice, and economic 
progress. What I am saying is that everyone has a contribution 
to make in accordance with his means. There is a social 
imbalance in the way burdens are currently distributed. 
  [DIE ZEIT] You once said that Germany needs more creativity, 
boldness, a pioneering spirit. What does that mean? 
  [Scharping] First, what that means is that we need elites 
and their example. Helmut Schmidt is fond of citing the Hamburg 
constitution: Everyone has a moral obligation to contribute to 
the common good. 
  [DIE ZEIT] The SPD has not used the world "elite" in a 
long time. 
  [Scharping] What can one object to about the term elite if 
it means a high level of ability and embraces equal access to 
such elites, which is also why we talk about equality of 
opportunity. 
  I also think that it is an extreme form of condensing things 
to just talk of Germany as a center for business. It leaves 
people's living conditions out of the picture. That is why in 
debate I always use word that has come from the Protestant 
Church and talk about Germany as a "center for living." That is 
because the situation of the 4 million unemployed, the many 
millions who have to live on social welfare, and the many who do 
not have a proper home, should not be left out of the picture. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Technology has an important role in the issue of 
Germany as a center. However, is it not given enough too 
little attention in political discussion? 
  [Scharping] We are too cautious and slow with new products, 
with new technical opportunities, the translation of technical 
progress and new findings in production. In Europe, all these 
things can be better dealt with jointly than if they were 
tackled by individual countries. What we need in Germany is a 
training, technology, and research offensive. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Then the SPD will have to undergo some changes. 
  [Scharping] Yes, on the reformist left-wing side, there is 
almost a boundless belief in technical progress. Ernst Bloch 
said that one could solve all the worlds poverty problems with 
one pile of atoms. Since then, the pendulum has very much swung 
in the opposite direction. I am in favor of staging a public 
debate with broad participation that would weigh up interests 
and ideas, then make decisions, and use the opportunities that 
are available. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Will you set deadlines for abandoning nuclear 
energy as was the case in a previous SPD program? 
  [Scharping] It is our firm goal to abandon nuclear energy. 
However, every deadline is subject to the problem that today one 
cannot tell when and in what form a consensus will be reached on 
the questions. I think that it makes sense to have a consensus 
on energy policy in Germany, because of the need to have a 
secure energy supply, reliable framework conditions, and the 
necessary security for the domestic coal industry. I do not 
know whether achieving such a consensus is possible, but we will 
carry on seeking it. That means that it does make sense to 
establish remaining periods of use for nuclear power plants on 
case by case basis if necessary. The general direction is: We 
want to get out of nuclear energy as quickly as possible, with 
an emphasis on this aspect as quickly as possible. 
  [DIE ZEIT] At the Munich security conference, you recently 
stressed that there were no fundamental differences between you 
and the government on foreign policy. Would the CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union] not be able to say that the SPD is pursuing 
"politics without a beard?" 
  [Scharping] A policy based on the intellect and the heart is 
any event better than one without a beard. I found that CDU 
poster amusing. As far as foreign policy is concerned, there is 
no disagreement over fundamental issues: European integration, 
a secure place in the community of Western democracies, 
including NATO, and a reliable relationship with the states to 
our east that is as friendly as possible. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Do you support the timetable for economic and 
monetary union? 
  [Scharping] The criteria are more important than the 
timeframe, which does not mean that one should postpone 
everything until some never-never day. However, a stable 
currency is an indispensable pillar of an economic policy for 
economic progress, growth that takes account of ecological 
factors, and for instilling confidence in people. 
  [DIE ZEIT] It has almost been forgotten that there was a 
difficult discussion in the SPD on the role of the Bundeswehr. 
What does that program have to say about that? 
  [Scharping] Today, there is virtually no disagreement within 
the SPD about the issue. It is, to a much greater extent, the 
only point on which we disagree with the government on a key 
foreign policy issue. I am very much in favor of Germany being 
active in the United Nations. The United Nations should be 
strengthened. We want to participate in the measures that the 
UN has implemented over the past few years and is expected to 
implement over the next few years if it is able to. It would 
exclude -- this is the precise boundary --active Bundeswehr 
participation in the waging of war. 
  [DIE ZEIT] You know the words from the song about "the 
international winning human rights." What is your position on 
the far from infrequent cases where German export interests and 
the requirements of a consistent human rights policy clash, as 
in the case of China and Iran? 
  [Scharping] It is necessary for negotiations about world 
trade and appropriate agreements -- GATT for example -- to 
devote much more attention to human rights, to protection 
against social dumping and environmental dumping. What should 
no longer occur is that in the same year, the United Nations can 
issue a charter on the rights of children while a world trade 
agreement makes no mentions whatsoever of the brutal 
exploitation of children. Global environmental and developments 
policies are an area in which I see a great need and great 
chances for intensive cooperation with the United States. 
  [DIE ZEIT] But what happens in a specific case. During his 
visit to China, Secretary of State Warren Christopher gave 
prominence to human rights. Others who are competing with 
America in that market do not do that. That poses dilemmas for 
democratic governments. How would you resolve such a dilemma? 
  [Scharping] One will never find perfect solutions. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Does the SPD support the government's policy on 
China? 
  [Scharping] To my mind, the consistent pursuit of human 
rights is too weak an element in relations with China. 
  [DIE ZEIT] What do you think would jeopardize victory in the 
Bundestag elections the most? The overthrow of Yeltsin in 
Moscow or -- to use your words -- new "carryings-on" in the SPD? 
  [Scharping] I think that the biggest risk is that far too 
many people will act on the quite natural assumption the the SPD 
will win the elections and lead the next government. There is 
still plenty of hard work to be done. Even with good election 
results and good ratings in opinion polls, we should not let up 
at any time, because there are almost exactly seven months to go 
until 16 October. 
  [DIE ZEIT] Why do you actually want to become chancellor? 
  [Scharping] Because I think that I can do the job and do it 
better than others.

<F P=106> [Ulrich Rosenbaum report: "SPD: Those Who Earn More -- as </F>
of 2,500 Marks"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Yesterday Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping presented his party's 
draft for a government program. On Monday [21 March] he will 
also present it to the SPD Executive Committee. By doing this, 
he is attempting to anticipate indiscretions and, at the same 
time, counter reports that the SPD is planning massive tax 
increases, Scharping said. He made it clear that, if the SPD 
wins the elections, he does not want to go beyond the tax quota 
of 1995. However, "redistributions" in the tax system at the 
cost of those who earn more are intended. 
  The SPD chairman affirmed that his party wants to replace 
the 
solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent for all taxpayers, which has 
been in effect as of 1 January, with a 10-percent supplementary 
tax. This is to be levied as of an annual income of 50,000 
German marks [DM] for singles and DM100,000 for married couples. 
According to calculations made by DIE WELT, this corresponds to 
a monthly net income of about DM2,500 for singles and DM5,000 
for married couples (without deduction of health insurance 
contributions). According to the SPD, the bottom line is to be 
the same as in the case of the solidarity surcharge: DM27 
billion per year. 
  Scharping also recalled the assignment of the Federal 
Constitutional Court to exempt the subsistence minimum from 
taxes as of 1996 at the latest. The SPD will tackle this matter 
immediately. By easing the tax burden on lower and medium 
incomes, the party expects increased demand and thus a 
stimulation of the economic development. 
  The SPD wants to find a basically new regulation for the 
equalization of burdens on families. The tax-free amount for 
children is to be abolished and replaced with a unified 
children's allowance of DM250 per child, which is to be deducted 
directly from the taxes owed. If someone is entitled to more 
children's allowance than he pays in taxes, he gets the 
difference directly from the financial authorities. On the 
other hand, a still unspecified upper limit is to be introduced 
for spouse's tax splitting. 
  In order to abolish the "fairness gap" in financing German 
unification, which has developed over the past years, high 
private incomes and large fortunes are to make a greater 
contribution. This includes, among other things, a higher 
inheritance tax. 
  The program also mentions the "ecological tax reform," but 
it 
does not speak of raising the petroleum tax. Scharping pointed 
to the planned unified energy tax of the European Union. 
  Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel criticized that the 
supplementary tax will lead to serious disturbances in the 
economy. Finance Minister Theo Waigel called Scharping's 
proposals dubious. The supplementary tax, which already hits 
average wage-earners, does not yield one single mark to finance 
the other SPD projects.

<F P=106> [Interview with Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy head of </F>
the SPD; place and date not given: "The `No' Was Clear To Hear"] 
  [Text][DER SPIEGEL] On 28 February German soldiers in an 
AWACS surveillance plane participated in a combat mission for 
the first time in the history of the FRG. The Social Democratic 
Party [SPD] presidium commented on it by blandly describing it 
as a "serious incident." But just a few months ago, the SPD 
still voiced strict opposition to combat missions at its party 
congress and brought the matter before the constitutional court. 
How do these two positions fit together? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] We hold to the position the SPD took at its 
party congress. Our foreign policy must not be based on military 
operations. If we take over the government as of next fall, that 
means that the mission of the Bundeswehr will continue to be the 
defense of the alliance and the defense of our nation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And what about UN peacekeeping operations? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] Let us leave semantics out of it. 
"Peacemaking" is synonymous to waging war. In our view, the 
Bundeswehr should only take part in humanitarian and 
peacekeeping blue helmet operations at the request of the United 
Nations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What if the constitutional court decides that 
combat operations are permissible? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] An SPD-led government will not resort to 
any 
such decision. We will make a political decision on every single 
peacekeeping mission in accordance with the criteria we agreed 
upon at the party congress. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does the SPD still consider the 28 February 
mission unconstitutional as Burkhard Hirsch, the Free Democratic 
Party (FDP) Bundestag deputy, does or was that a "peacekeeping 
blue helmet mission" as specified by your party congress 
decision? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] Of course German participation in the AWACS 
flights was and still is unconstitutional. That is why we lodged 
the appeal with the Karlsruhe [constitutional] court. The NATO 
operation itself, on the other hand, was lawful because it was 
based on a UN resolution. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How can something be legitimate, if it is 
unconstitutional? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] From the point of view of international law 
it was legitimate. The question of legitimacy under 
international law and the constitutional situation in the FRG 
have nothing to do with each other. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Now what about the FRG's obligations under the 
alliance? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] The SPD is not responsible for the fact 
that 
the UN assigns military missions to a military defense alliance 
such as NATO as a regional organization. Up until a few months 
ago that was unthinkable. But if such orders are issued, they 
can under no circumstances alter the the NATO mission, which is 
to defend the alliance. Under the NATO treaty no obligation 
exists to take part in operations such as the AWACS flights. The 
FRG can say without any hesitation that it will not take part. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Bosnia operation is a NATO action on 
behalf 
of the United Nations. Isn't it time the SPD made up its mind 
whether it is prepared to cede such powers to the UN or merely 
wants to keep on calling for a stronger UN? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] In procedures like these the danger is that 
NATO might control the UN and not the other way around. The 
Bundeswehr chief of staff has since demanded that NATO should 
not accept any mandate from the UN in the future but should 
intervene militarily on its own. We cannot but be strongly 
opposed to that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why did the SPD presidium create the 
impression 
in its statement that the opposition did approve of the decision 
to shoot down the aircraft? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] It was not the presidium's job to "approve" 
the downing of the aircraft. That is not what we did. We said it 
was legitimate. And beyond that we gave priority to the 
situation of the people living in the former Yugoslavia and did 
not engage in a debate on basic issues. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] At the Munich military affairs conference SPD 
chairman Rudolf Scharping said there are "no real differences" 
on basic foreign policy issues between the SPD opposition and 
Christian-liberal coalition. 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] The way I understand what he said at that 
conference--and it is a position to which I subscribe as 
well--is that the SPD does not put the basic decisions of German 
foreign policy into question, i.e. membership in the European 
Union, in NATO and in CSCE. But there are serious differences 
with the coalition on the mission of the Bundeswehr. We do not 
want any war and combat missions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Internationally, Scharping's Munich statement 
was also taken to reflect agreement with the Bundeswehr actions 
in Bosnia and Somalia. 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] It is understandable, isn't it, that one 
does not get involved in domestic policy debates in front of 
international visitors? But Rudolf Scharping's "no" to combat 
missions by the Bundeswehr was quite unequivocal at the military 
affairs conference. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] SPD Bundestag caucus chairman Klose--who has 
not been dismissed as the "foreign policy expert" of Scharping's 
government committee--wanted to characterize the NATO ultimatum 
to the Bosnian Serbs as an example of "credible deterrence" but 
was kept from including this assessment in the party executive's 
statement on the ultimatum. Why? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] It is simply the wrong language to use. For 
that matter, we reached a decision later which Klose agreed with. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think the ultimatum addressed to the 
those laying siege to Sarajevo and the downing of the combat 
aircraft are instruments which could also be applied to pacify 
the remaining hot spots in the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] I neither consider these instruments, nor 
the United States and the majority of the countries of Western 
Europe to be exemplary. Otherwise the Croats and Muslims would 
not be looking for a solution at the negotiating table in the 
United States and Russia would not be making efforts to 
influence the Serbs. The situation in the former Yugoslavia 
cannot be changed or improved by war but only by political means. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Politics did not enter the picture 
successfully 
until after the ultimatum had worked. 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] Unfortunately that is true. People would 
have been spared a great deal, if political pressure had been 
brought on all participants two years ago. Happily, we have been 
spared the proof of whether bombardments would have pacified the 
country--or expanded the war, as we all feared. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The social democrats create the confusing 
impression that their party chairman and their parliamentary 
leader agree on foreign policy and security policy issues on the 
voters' behalf but that within the party Heide 
Wieczorek-Zeul--who has been caricatured by many as the "holy 
inquisition"--is keeping watch over strict adherence to the 
decisions taken at the party congress. 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] I dispute the idea that Rudolf Scharping is 
on a different course from mine. We reach our decisions 
together; nobody secretly or publicly takes a different position 
from others. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In the first draft of your government program 
the SPD keeps clear of a debate on the role of the Bundeswehr. 
The relevant passage merely reads: "We would like to see the 
Bundeswehr remain an alliance army." That is a bit thin. 
  [Wieczorek-Zeul] So far we just have a preliminary draft in 
hand. Let us talk again when the program is really on paper. I 
am sure that the position on the role of the Bundeswehr will 
then be as clearly defined as we have discussed it here.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Weak Bone Structure--The Greens Are </F>
Planning for Coalition With the SPD"] 
  [Text] The Greens are preparing for an emergency, i.e. 
taking part in the government. As soon as the rank-and-file have 
decided Werner Schulz, the leader of the Alliance 90/Greens 
Bundestag caucus, would like to invite the most promising of the 
Bundestag election candidates to a meeting in Bonn at which a 
frank debate will be held on division of labor and personal 
ambitions. 
  Joschka Fischer who by now is the party's undisputed Number 
One has also gotten used to the idea that it will share power. 
Looking ahead to the 16 October election date, he would like to 
have a clear picture of who the members of the Alliance/Greens 
new Bundestag caucus are. Quite a few candidates have already 
told him they would like to be considered for high offices. 
  Some minor details are still missing, however: a mandate 
from 
the voters and a coalition partner. The wished-for partner being 
the Social Democratic Party (SPD). 
  But before that the "realos" of Fischer's ilk must get over 
their defeat at the Mannheim party congress week before last 
where the left wing of the party came out on top, calling for a 
halt to nuclear energy within two years and a world sans NATO 
and sans Bundeswehr: a Green antigovernment program, though not 
a binding commitment. 
  The established political parties gratefully picked up on 
the 
ancient slogans of the Greens, characterizing the utopians as 
being incapable of governing or even of taking part in political 
life. "People know that our party congresses always are a trifle 
gaga," Antje Vollmer says. "But different standards are applied 
once you start talking government." 
  The unhappy losers now fear that events at the party 
congress 
may present SPD Minister-President Gerhard Schroeder with an 
absolute majority at the election in Lower Saxony on 13 March. 
Which would spell the end of the red-and-green coalition there 
and represent a setback for the party's high hopes [for the 
national election later this year]. 
  The entire spectrum of the party, including the left wing, 
agrees that the Greens should help remove Helmut Kohl from 
office. The left wing, too, is already looking forward to 
sharing power. "That is for sure," says Ludger Volmer, the left 
wing's spokesman. "Everything is negotiable." 
  But the doubts about the party's capacity to govern have by 
no means been overcome. "catastrophism, actionism and moralism" 
still are part and parcel of the Greens' ideological baggage, 
Bremen sociologist Claus Offe says. "A weak bone structure" he 
calls it. 
  Fischer is calling for a strong dose of optimism 
nonetheless. 
He has already collected "a team of 20 people" which is to 
safeguard power in Bonn. He is bringing a reliable group of 
people from his Hesse Environmental Ministry along, from the 
state secretary on down. A reserve contingent stands ready, 
drawn from subordinate agencies. 
  Former GDR civil rights leader Schulz who, as he himself 
says, is "slowly getting his feet on the ground in Bonn" is also 
making plans "just in case." He is recruiting experts from 
eastern Germany and elsewhere. He has also gotten economists 
such as Bremen academic Rudolf Hickel who has regularly 
published alternative studies on the economic situation "to sign 
up." 
  In the fall, the Greens will no longer be satisfied with the 
Environment and Women's Affairs Ministries. Joachim Raschke, a 
Hamburg political scientist, has already drawn up bolder 
scenarios for expanding power. 
  New Concept Strategy: A Ministry for Multicultural 
Affairs would assume responsibilities presently assigned to the 
Federal Government's powerless foreign nationals commissioner. 
Additional responsibilities presently vested in the Interior 
Ministry would be required to process requests for information, 
for a say and overall control in foreigners' affairs. 
  Extension Strategy: A strong ministry which might 
set ecology policy could be established by clustering 
responsibilities for the environment and transportation. An 
effective Women's Affairs Ministry would have to include 
additional responsibilities presently assigned to the Family, 
Social and/or Health Ministries. 
  Me-Too Strategy: Why shouldn't the junior partner 
in a coalition with the SPD lay claim to one of the classic 
ministries? After all, the Free Democrats (FDP) traditionally 
asked for and got the Foreign Ministry as well as either the 
Interior or Justice Ministries. The Ministry for Development Aid 
could be a "lateral entry" vehicle into the foreign policy field. 
  The Green chiefs just love visions of this kind: "We don't 
intend to sell ourselves at a lower price than the FDP," says 
party spokesman Volmer. 
  Experts from peace research institutes as well as the 
Bundeswehr academy have been asked by the Green party leaders to 
draft proposals on what a Green foreign policy might look like. 
For his part, Fischer is working out proposals on his own. 
Though he does not like to fly he does spend every free minute 
at his computer to get a book on foreign policy published in 
time for the election--as proof of his knowledge and insights. 
  Big power or peace policy--that is the alternative as 
Fischer 
sees it. He does not shy away from a comparison with Klaus 
Kinkel, the current foreign minister. "What he can do," says 
prospective lateral entrant Fischer, "I can do anytime." 
  Party spokesman Volmer believes that the move into the 
foreign policy field is the correct one. In this connection, he 
is looking for a "new definition" of development aid. He would 
like like to see some of the responsibilities of the Finance and 
Economics Ministry transferred [to the Foreign Ministry] to 
enhance its status. Volmer says that "the position the FRG takes 
on the IMF is more important than a few millions in the budget." 
  Antje Vollmer's pet project is to have a member of the 
Greens 
become interior minister. She already made this suggestion 
during the red/green coalition negotiations both in Bremen and 
in Brandenburg--but without success. She feels that the Greens, 
acting as protectors of the constitution, should defend 
democratic practices and the rule of law, carry out a 
multicultural policy toward foreigners and assume the classical 
heritage of the FDP. 
  Not even adviser Raschke can seriously visualize a Green 
assuming any of these posts. The Interior and Foreign Ministries 
in particular, he says, are charged "to a great extent with 
responsibilities for repression and coercion" and this, in 
itself, would result in "sharp intra-party conflicts" with the 
rank-and-file. 
  Rather than the Interior Ministry, the party should take 
over 
the Justice portfolio, Raschke suggests. The latter post would 
enable the party to push for liberal judicial policy as well as 
"citizen-sponsored traditions." At this stage, even some former 
opponents deplore the fact that Otto Schily left the Green fold 
to join the SPD, since they no longer have an ideal candidate 
like him. 
  If and when the Greens make plans to enter the government, 
they are thinking almost without exception of a coalition with 
the social democrats which is a project promising of success, 
according to opinion polls. But if the outcome of the 16 October 
[Bundestag] vote only allows for a tripartite coalition which 
includes the FDP, the Greens would have to review the bidding. 
  But Raschke is optimistic even if things turn out worse than 
expected. In that case, the FDP would have to get industry and 
the business community to guarantee ecological reforms. A 
combination which includes the SPD, the Greens, and the FDP 
would at least bring about "a liberal tinge in political life," 
he says. 
  But that would only be a political option, party spokesman 
Volmer says, "if the country would otherwise turn into chaos."

<F P=106> [Article by Josef Joffe: "`The Zhirinovskiy Within </F>
Yeltsin'"] 
  [Text] Moscow, Mar -- In the Kempinskiy Hotel, a cup of 
coffee is 5 German marks, in the Penta you pay $250 for a modest 
room: For nonresidents, Moscow has become the most expensive 
city in Europe. But the Moscovites themselves are also fighting 
against a strange phenomenon these days: There is not only the 
familiar ruble hyperinflation, but also soaring dollar prices. 
This means that there is much more money than goods, and that 
the Russian economic reform has only liberated one part of the 
market: demand, but not supply. Supply is still governed by 
the old monopolies, and even non-Marxists know that monopolies 
always lower output, not prices. 
  Boris Yeltsin's fate will be decided in this field, and not 
even the most considerate Westerner can help him there, neither 
with money, nor with words. Only the Russians themselves can 
impose a functioning market economy on their country; but to do 
this they would need a "strong efficient state machinery, which 
no longer exists," says political scientist Andrej Kortunov. 
But: (Mainly self-made) obstacles are also piling up for 
Yeltsin in his relations with the West: Russian interests are 
meanwhile being defined more comprehensive, "the tone has become 
harsher," says Vladimir Lukov, an adviser to Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev. What are the Russian interests? 
  This question was dealt with at a symposium held in Moscow 
by 
the Friedrich-Naumann and the Konrad-Adenauer Foundations. The 
deputy minister for federal affairs said that the Russians have 
never learned how to conduct realpolitik; like the Germans, they 
have a rather "metaphysical" approach. For him, the definition 
is quite simple: economic solutions. He wants fair export 
prices for fuel and gas and a continuing presence in the arms 
markets: "Messianism and expansion are over." Even in the 
Balkans, Russia is "conservative," what counts there is the 
"balance of power." 
  Kozyrev adviser Kusnetsov said much the same thing: The old 
imperialism is out; he is not interested in Pan-Slavism and 
state interests, but in the "rights and interests of the 
citizens." This is the real revolution that has happened since 
1991. If only it were as simple as that. Igor Artjonov, head 
of the National Patriotic Party, on the other hand said: "The 
Russian Federation is not the last stage. The future lies with 
an Eastern Slav Alliance with Belarus and Ukraine." 
  "Reintegration of neighboring countries," has meanwhile 
become the magic formula; and even for Alexeiy Pushkov, deputy 
chief of the liberal Moscow News, this includes Kazakhstan 
beside Kiev and Minsk, and "nobody will be able to prevent 
Moscow from reintegrating them." The Russians simply cannot 
accept that their country is no longer a superpower. May the 
Baltic states remain outside? There, Kozyrev adviser Lukov says, 
the only issue is the protection of the Russian minority. Yet: 
"We are now taking a harder line with Estonia and Latvia." 
  Sergei Rogov from the U.S. Institute found bitter, sarcastic 
words for the new policy: "The Kozyrevs are becoming more 
radical than the Zhirinovskiys, and what is behind this is not 
strategy but sheer opportunism." Yeltsin has spoiled the 
economic reform and lost the confidence placed in him. Now the 
only thing he wants is to remain in power, and to achieve this, 
Yeltsin would collaborate with anybody. At the moment, the army 
is his main support, which saved him during the coup. And now 
he has to prove to the generals that he "is not selling [Russia 
off] to the Zionist-Imperialist world conspiracy." 
  This belief has just been proved: While Yeltsin is at the 
Black Sea, Defense Minister Grachev is standing in for him in 
Moscow. Yet, the biggest danger are not the ultrarightists, but 
"the Zhirinovskiy within Yeltsin." What the West can do? "Not 
much, except for massive investments in the private sector. 
Russia must be saved in Russia."

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In an article entitled "The 
Capitulationists" that appeared in the 11 March Lisbon daily 
PUBLICO, commentator Miguel Sousa Tavares praises the United 
States for forcefully intervening in Kuwait, Somalia, and 
Bosnia. In Kuwait, he writes, President Saddam Husayn's 
challenge "represented everything that was unacceptable." 
Despite West Europe's past -- "and still present" -- tendency to 
capitulationism, in 1991 the United States, which was not 
"contaminated" by this virus, solved the problem in "exemplary 
military and political fashion," Sousa Tavares writes. 
Capitulationists, again upset when the United States decided to 
put an end to the Somali "reign of terror," "gloated" when U.S. 
and Pakistani peacekeepers lost their lives because their dire 
predictions were coming true, he continues. Now it is the turn 
of Bosnia, where after two years of "medieval barbarity and 
European cowardice" the United States and France forced the UN 
and NATO to act, according to Sousa Tavares. The same naysayers 
predicted that the ultimatum given to the Serbs would only 
"aggravate the situation," Sousa Tavares writes. In the end, 
Saddam Husayn was expelled from Kuwait and Iraq no longer is a 
threat to the world. Somali warlord Mohamed Aidid was contained 
and no Somalis are dying of hunger. Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic 
realized that his ethnic cleansing campaign would not be 
entirely tolerated and Sarajevo has not been shelled in recent 
weeks. The silence that those predicting disaster have kept over 
these facts proves the vacuity of their arguments, Sousa Tavares 
contends. Where diplomacy has failed and recourse to force may 
produce results, the international community should not hesitate 
to intervene. Whether it is termed the "right of humanitarian 
interference" or something else, "we must not resign ourselves 
to situations that are an insult to humanity," Sousa Tavares 
concludes.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The "old alliance" established 600 years 
ago between Portugal and Great Britain was a 
political-diplomatic agreement against the Spaniards, writes 
Jose Vegar in the 5 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO. Noting that 
"things are not much different today," it is still in Lisbon's 
strategic interest to align itself with the United Kingdom in 
the field of European construction, he contends. Vegar cites 
Carlos Gaspar, adviser to President Mario Soares, as saying that 
"it is necessary to choose the lesser of two evils, between 
those who wish to preserve Portugal's transatlantic vocation and 
the European Union (EU) and those who opt for subregional 
integrations that obviate the existence of the Community." In 
Gaspar's opinion, Portugal profits from aligning itself with 
Great Britain within the framework of the EU, for this 
"reinforces the tripartite center (France, Germany, United 
Kingdom)...so enlargement will not negatively affect it." Vegar 
cites Gaspar's concern about a possible fragmentation of the 
Union through the formation of subregional Scandinavian, 
Iberian, or German blocs. 
  On the other hand, Vegar also cites Andre Goncalves Pereira, 
former minister of foreign affairs, as saying that "there is no 
privileged relationship between Portugal and Great Britain." An 
alliance made sense when Portugal first entered the EC, given 
the somewhat parallel Portuguese and English positions on 
federalism at that time. However, following EC assistance to 
Portugal, Lisbon's present stance is much closer to the official 
EU position, which collides with London's traditional 
antifederalism, Goncalves Pereira is cited as saying. Vegar then 
cites Socialist Party (PS) luminary and former Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Jaime Gama, who notes that "it is to our 
advantage to maintain an intense relationship with the United 
Kingdom because we are partners in NATO and the EU." 
Nevertheless, Gama continues, the object of this alliance "was 
transferred from England to the United States, which 
unfortunately never occupied this vacuum because it has a 
different awareness of international issues." Finally, Gama is 
cited as claiming that the "old theory of Atlantic versus 
continental nations" cannot justify Portugal's interest in 
favoring a close relationship with Great Britain, for "the world 
is presently regulated by multipolarity, and a specific response 
to each problem is needed."

<F P=106> [Article by Isaias Gomes Teixeira: "The Dance of the </F>
Generals"] 
  [Excerpts] Following the appointment of Admiral Fuzeta da 
Ponte as chief of the Armed Forces General Staff (CEMFGA), the 
Army, Navy, and Air Force are planning various changes in their 
top leadership during March. 
  The Air Force is the only branch of the service where 
changes 
are practically defined. General Baptista Pereira, who was its 
inspector general for the last five years, will leave midmonth 
for the Azores to assume the command of that autonomous region, 
replacing Admiral Malheiro Garcia. 
  Baptista Pereira's departure will make possible a promotion 
in the generals' ranks. According to available information, 
Brigadier General Vasques Osorio will be chosen by the Air Force 
Superior Council to receive a third star. To replace Baptista 
Pereira, General Mendes Dias will reportedly appoint Evandro do 
Amaral, presently in charge of the Air Force 
Logistic-Administrative Command (CLAFA). This appointment stems 
from the fact that Evandro is one of the generals with the most 
seniority, a prerequisite for occupying the third-highest 
position within the Air Force. 
  With Evandro do Amaral's appointment as inspector general, 
the problem of his replacement arises. According to our sources, 
Sergio Carrilho is best placed to become CLAFA chief, even if 
the final decision has not yet been made. In fact, Carrilho has 
an excellent technical preparation for the post. Secondly, 
Mendes Dias's options are limited if he does not wish to cause a 
veritable revolution in the top leadership, for the following 
reasons: 
  General Alvarenga Santos, presently deputy CEMFGA in charge 
of operations, has already been named to head the Portuguese 
military mission to NATO, and is thus out of the running. So is 
Aleixo Corbal, in charge of Air Force personnel, since he is a 
past CLAFA chief. Another possibility would be Vaz Afonso. 
However, this general has been director of the Air Force 
Institute for Higher Studies for less than a year and could not 
be transferred again. 
  Under these circumstances, Sergio Carrilho appears to be the 
best solution, all the more so because the issue of his own 
replacement as head of the Air Force Operational Command (COFA) 
-- one of the best posts in this branch of the service -- is 
easy to solve. Brig. Gen. Vasques Osorio, who should get his 
third star with the departure of Baptista Pereira, would be a 
natural replacement for Sergio Carrilho. 
  As far as the Navy is concerned, important changes are 
expected during the course of this month, first because it has 
lacked a general staff chief, and second because there are four 
vice admiral positions waiting to be filled. Until yesterday 
afternoon, the government had not decided which of three 
officers (Machado da Silva, Ribeiro Pacheco, and Carmo Duro) 
will succeed Fuzeta da Ponte as Navy chief. According to our 
sources, the decision will be made next week. Meanwhile, Admiral 
Machado da Silva, deputy chief of the Navy general staff, is 
reportedly out of the running, the reason being the rather 
inflexible image he projects. Above all a military man, Machado 
da Silva has great difficulty adapting himself to the political 
game that the relationship between military chiefs and the 
Ministry of Defense represents. 
  A factor that may influence the government's choice is Adm. 
Fuzeta da Ponte's opinion. As principal adviser to Minister of 
Defense Fernando Nogueira, Fuzeta reportedly has expressed a 
preference for Carmo Duro. [passage omitted] 
  However, despite Carmo Duro's strong support within and 
without the Navy, his appointment may cause important changes 
that do not figure in the government's plans. According to 
information, if Carmo Duro becomes the next Navy general staff 
chief, four promotions to vice admiral rank ought to take place, 
a figure considered excessive at a time when the Ministry of 
Defense's slogan is "redimensioning." 
  Finally, the Army is also preparing for important changes. 
The Army Superior Council met for a whole day to advise 
Cerqueira Rocha about the general he should indicate to Fuzeta 
da Ponte for the presidency of the Supreme Military Tribunal. 
Joao Almeida Bruno was the name that attracted the largest 
consensus. 
  With regard to other appointments, it seems increasingly 
certain that General Espirito Santo, present chief of the 
Portuguese mission to NATO, will take over the Army's 
operational command.

<F P=106> [Report by Richard Savill and Robert Shrimsley: "Tory </F>
Outrage at Dublin `Concessions' to IRA"] 
  [Text] The Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Dick Spring, 
moved yesterday to ease fears of a rift between London and 
Dublin after a magazine article in which he appeared to suggest 
that a temporary ceasefire would be enough to win the IRA a seat 
at the negotiating table. 
  His comments, in an interview with the Left of centre New 
Century magazine, enraged Unionists and backbench Conservatives 
coming just after news of an IRA plot to murder a senior Tory MP. 
  Mr Andrew Hunter, Tory MP for Basingstoke and chairman of 
the 
backbench Northern Ireland committee -- the post held by the 
late Mr Ian Gow when he was murdered by the terrorists -- 
confirmed this weekend that he had been the target of an 
assassination plot. 
  Unconfirmed reports suggest that an explosive package was 
intercepted en route to his home and the MP has now been given 
24-hour armed protection at his Berkshire home. Security at 
Westminster has also been stepped up. 
  Yesterday he admitted that the incident, the day after the 
second mortar attack on Heathrow airport, and the subsequent 
security had been "pretty hellish". Mr Hunter reacted with 
understandable anger to Mr Spring's article and remained 
unconvinced by the foreign minister's later explanations. 
  In the magazine Mr Spring is reported as saying: "I think it 
is possible they (the IRA) will offer some temporary cessation 
of violence in order to sit down round the table with other 
nationalist parties... That is going to pose a bit of a 
dilemma. If they offer a temporary ceasefire we will want to 
find a way of building on that without making any concessions to 
them." 
  Yesterday afternoon however Mr Spring used an interview on 
Irish Radio to stress that he was not saying a temporary 
ceasefire would suffice, simply that it might be necessary to 
give the terrorists some help as they "inched" their way towards 
peace. 
  However, his comments served only to fuel suspicion among 
Unionists and Tories. Mr Hunter said: "We are not in the 
business of appeasing the IRA. I don't understand what a 
temporary ceasefire would mean. There is no way you can sit at 
the negotiating table with them if they are saying that if they 
don't get what they want they will start shooting again." 
  Mr Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist MP, said: "I 
think this confirms my view that if there is a tactical pause in 
violence, the Irish government would invite the IRA in on the 
basis of a temporary ceasefire. This appears to be part of the 
process that the IRA can be brought in without giving up 
violence."

  [Text] Rome, March 19 (AFP) -- Leaders of Italy's leftist 
movements renewed accusations Saturday [19 March] that media 
magnate Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party is 
encouraging the mafia to vote for it in forthcoming elections. 
  Leoluca Orlando, the anti-mafia mayor in the Sicilian city 
of 
Palermo, said several of Sicily's Forza Italy candidates for the 
March 27-28 poll had obtained the backing of top mafiosi. 
  The leader of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), 
Achille 
Occhetto, said Friday [18 March] evening during a campaign rally 
that Berlusconi's party had "been pledged support by Don 
Piromalli," the boss of the N'Drangheta mafia based in the 
southern region of Calabria. 
  And Luciano Violante, the chairman of parliament's 
anti-mafia 
commission and a leftist candidate in the poll in a Sicily 
constituency, told AFP that the "political entourage" of Forza 
Italy was suspect. 
  There was "not necessarily" an agreement between the party 
and the mafia, he said, but "it seems to me that Forza Italia 
has not rejected support" proffered by leading figures of 
Italy's corrupt institutional past "who are trying to make a 
comeback." 
  Meanwhile Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, a Christian 
Democrat, told the Neapolitan Daily Il Mattino Saturday that 
"rumours" that the mafia was poised to pledge its support for 
Forza Italia "must be verified." 
  Forza Italia's spokesman, Antonio Tajani, dismissed reported 
mafia links as "pure defamation." 
  The election campaign has shaped up increasingly as a 
two-horse race between Berlusconi and the PDS, with the latest 
opinion poll Saturday crediting right-wing parties with 40.9 
percent of the poll and parties of the left with 37.7 percent.

  [Excerpts] According to Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, 
Finland will immediately take a stance on its observer status in 
the Western European Union, WEU, if Finland becomes a EU 
[European Union] member. Finland's operations in NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program, for their part, will extend 
further than the planned peacekeeping training, Foreign Minister 
Haavisto says. The agreement will be signed later in the 
spring, and Finland will at that point give its own declaration. 
Jarkko Juselius reporting: 
  [Begin recording] [Juselius] The building blocks for 
Finland's security policy are slowly being gathered together in 
different places. It is starting to look apparent that 
Finland's observer membership of the Western European Union, 
WEU, will be implemented fairly quickly if Finland becomes an EU 
member. According to Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, Finland 
will take a stance on observer membership fairly quickly after 
the possible membership [in the EU]. Will Finland be ready when 
membership has been secured, or if it is secured, will Finland 
be ready immediately after that to take measures to become an 
observer member of the WEU? 
  [Haavisto] There are no decisions on this but we will 
certainly take a stance, if and when membership starts. 
  [Juselius] Immediately? 
  [Haavisto] Fairly quickly after joining. 
  [Juselius] Foreign Minister Haavisto does not yet speak of 
observer membership but Foreign Trade Minister Pertti 
Salolainen, for his part, announced at the beginning of March 
that he thinks it is fairly clear that Finland will become at 
least an observer member of the WEU. [passage omitted] 
  [Juselius] According to Haavisto, at the agreement signing 
ceremony Finland will present its own declaration on Finland's 
Partnership for Peace aims. 
  [Haavisto] Yes, we will present our own declaration, where 
we 
will say that we are a partner giving help, making a 
contribution to this peacekeeping cooperation. 
  [Juselius] Once more, when is this agreement going to be 
signed? 
  [Haavisto] I cannot give you an exact date, but sometime in 
the spring. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias returned from 
Washington and made the following statement to correspondents: 
It was a very short trip with many meetings and of course the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the issue under discussion. 
As I said, the talks I had with both U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, 
as well as with Presidents Alia Izetbekovic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, were very 
interesting and substantive. 
  I think, Papoulias said, the current effort by the U.S. 
Administration has brought, at least in its first phase, 
successful results, that is, the signing of an agreement for 
federation between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats. The meeting 
between the European Union [EU] foreign ministers in Ioannina 
[northwestern Greek town] on 26-27 March will bring important 
decisions on the role that the European Union will play in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course the U.S. factor is welcome as is 
that of Russia, but the EU Action Plan remains the center for 
reaching a viable and peaceful solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Papoulias said.

  [Text] Berlin, March 21 (AFP) -- The German government has 
demanded Syria extradite the terrorist "Carlos" and a 
collaborator, both wanted in connection with a 1983 attack in 
then-West Berlin. 
  Earlier requests by the German ambassador in Damascus had so 
far been met with "partly irritated and partly negative" 
responses from the Syrian authorities, Hartmut Hilldenberg of 
the German foreign ministry said Monday [21 March]. 
  He is a witness to a court hearing dealing with the 1983 
attack on the French cultural centre in West Berlin, Maison de 
France, in which one person died and 23 were injured. 
  The Syrians have denied involvement in the incident. 
However, a Syrian diplomat admitted that Damascus supported the 
Carlos group in the early 1980s. German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel met his Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Chareh, in Bonn 
Thursday to express the German demands for the extradition of 
Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias Carlos and his German associate 
Johannes Weinrich. 
  Investigators believe those who carried out the attack 
wanted 
to free another one of Carlos' associates, a German woman named 
Magdalena Kopp. In 1982 she was sentenced to four years 
imprisonment in France for possessing explosives.

<F P=106> ["wtr" report: "Syria Rejects Partial Negotiations With </F>
Israel"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 18 Mar -- Despite harsh accusations against 
Israel, Syria is obviously interested in not letting the 
currently stalemated peace process in the Middle East fail. At 
the conclusion of his two-day visit to Bonn, Syrian Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that his country has a "real will 
for a lasting and comprehensive peace." At the same time, 
however, he rejected "partial negotiations" with Israel. After 
the Hebron massacre, the international community now must exert 
pressure on Israel, which, in Syria's view is not "seriously" 
interested in a "just peace." 
  He fears that, with its policy of two-sided negotiations 
with 
its neighbors, Israel just wants to divide the Arab camp, 
al-Shar' said. "Partial solutions" would not bring about peace 
but, perhaps, even worsen the situation. Thus, the agreement 
between Israel and the PLO did not bring peace, but only 
encouraged extremists. The bloodbath of Hebron was the 
"consequence of this agreement." With this position al-Shar' 
contradicted the view of his host, German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany), who had called the 
agreement a first step toward a "constructive prospect for a 
lasting reconciliation." 
  Despite his rejection of partial negotiations with Israel, 
in 
talking to journalists al-Shar' evaded the question of whether 
and under which conditions Syria would be ready or resume direct 
talks with Israel. He repeated the demand for a complete 
withdrawal of the settlers and a complete return of the occupied 
territories. Diplomatic circles in Bonn noted positively that 
the Syrian minister accused "extremists from both sides" -- and 
not just Israel alone -- of endangering the peace process. 
  Syria is interested in more intensive relations with the 
European Union. Kinkel promised to advocate a meeting of the 
European-Syrian Cooperation Council at the end of the year. 
Reportedly, he urged his guest for an extradition agreement 
with the FRG. According to intelligence service findings, 
German terrorist and Carlos associate Weinrich has found refuge 
in Syria. Syria's government denies this.

<F P=106> [Interview with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner by </F>
Christian Stoeger in Brussels; date not given: "`NATO Will Not 
Force Its Friendship Upon Anybody'"] 
  [Text] "Those who are in it are 99 percent safe, those who 
are outside are unsafe," Manfred Woerner, bearing the signs of 
his serious illness, said in an interview with DER STANDARD. 
"This is also true for ethnic conflicts, which should not be 
neglected. After all, NATO membership is also a declaration of 
support for basic democratic values and thus the guarantee for 
stability within the member states. This also applies to the 
new Partnership for Peace [PfP]." 
  [Stoeger] Is the Partnership, which was adopted in January, 
and which even Russia now intends to join, to be regarded as a 
step-by-step extension of NATO? 
  [Woerner] Partnership for Peace is intended to extend 
stability further to the East, but must not be regarded as an 
antechamber to NATO or as waiting room for accession to the 
community. A step-by-step extension of NATO is quite possible 
-- and also desirable. However, not all countries that want to 
can immediately join NATO. It requires coordination. For some 
countries that participate in Partnership for Peace it is 
certainly the path toward NATO membership, while for others it 
is not. 
  [Stoeger] Austria is also free to join the partnership, but 
it has so far shown little interest. What will NATO do to 
convince the Austrians of the advantage of such accession? 
  [Woerner] Nothing. The Austrians know themselves what they 
have to do and they are free to decide. Moreover, Partnership 
for Peace is only an offer that may or may not be taken up. 
NATO will certainly not force its friendship upon anybody. All 
I can say is if you do not want to, well, then you do not have 
to. We have enough applicants. 
  [Stoeger] Some former East Bloc countries initially rejected 
this offer as insufficient, but ultimately accepted it. Why? 
  [Woerner] Because there is no efficient alternative. Why is 
everybody trying so hard to get into NATO? Because of our 
beautiful blue eyes? Certainly not. It is because we offer 
absolute security. This is not only hot air but the essence of 
the security concept. NATO will certainly not stand idly by in 
case a partner is attacked. Still I will not say what we would 
do. That is also part of deterrence. 
  [Stoeger] Both Greece and Turkey are NATO members; 
nevertheless, the Cyprus problem remains unsolved. 
  [Woerner] The Cyprus problem is not within NATO's 
responsibility, but within that of the United Nations. Yet, 
NATO membership certainly prevented escalation, because there is 
still more dynamite around. If the two countries involved were 
not members the problem would be much worse. 
  [Stoeger] As in the former Yugoslavia? What has NATO been 
able to do in this conflict? 
  [Woerner] First of all, I would like to emphasize that in 
this conflict the responsibility does not lie with the United 
Nations. An earlier use of limited military power would have 
been better, as could be seen by the example of the Sarajevo 
ultimatum. NATO has long since been ready, but the UN order did 
not come. Now one is able to regain credibility. After all, 
peace securing includes three main points: first, the necessary 
means to deter the aggressors, second, the will to use these 
means fully if necessary, third, also to make that clear to the 
aggressor. 
  [Stoeger] Still, particularly in the case of the Balkan war, 
there are still some deficits, especially regarding the Serbian 
embargo. 
  [Woerner] By and large, the sea embargo is working. Here 
there are no problems. NATO units have virtually sealed off the 
coast. The NATO-monitored no-fly zone is also being respected. 
Still, as far as efficiency is concerned there are still 
deficits, particularly regarding coordination between the United 
Nations and NATO. In many cases UN orders to take action take 
too long. NATO would be able to react much faster.

<F P=106> [Interview with Maris Budovski, president of the Assembly of </F>
Baltic Countries, by Christophe De Fossa in the Hague; date not 
given: "Baltic Countries Appeal to Benelux Countries"--first 
paragraph is LA LIBRE BELGIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] A delegation from the Assembly of Baltic Countries 
attended the Benelux Interparliamentary Council session held on 
Friday [18 March] and Saturday in The Hague. There we met with 
Maris Budovski, who is the president of the Assembly of Baltic 
Countries. 
  [De Fossa] How long has there been cooperation between the 
assemblies of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania? 
  [Budovski] The Assembly of Baltic Countries as such only 
dates back to 1990, but our cooperation is much older than that. 
In 1919, the united military forces of Estonia and Latvia 
fought the Red Army. Subsequently, there was cooperation 
between the foreign ministers of the three states. However, I 
would like to point out that, while we were able to resist 
Soviet totalitarianism, it was mainly because of our traditions, 
our folklore. This may be a unique phenomenon. The dance and 
singing festivals have brought together, and continue to 
regularly bring together, tens of thousands of participants from 
our three countries. This has contributed toward binding us 
together; it is something that could perhaps be called the 
"singing revolution." 
<H5>  A Council of Ministers for the Baltic States? </H5>
  [De Fossa] Is there cooperation between your governments? 
  [Budovski] The ministers cooperate with their counterparts 
in 
the other Baltic states. This is especially true today with the 
defense ministers. During the session held in Tallin late last 
year, the Assembly of Baltic Countries adopted a resolution 
calling on the governments of the three Baltic states to set up 
a Council of Ministers for the Baltic States. We also organized 
joint maneuvers. Of course, we only have very limited military 
resources, but in doing so we wanted to express our wish not to 
see a repeat of what happened in 1940. 
  [De Fossa] What are you expecting from the Benelux? 
  [Budovski] We are looking for cooperation because we have 
common interests. I am thinking, for example, of cooperation in 
terms of harbor facilities. We have excellent harbors, which 
are very well equipped. So do the Benelux countries. Why do we 
not organize a union at this level, given the importance of the 
East European market and the fact that the gauge of our 
railroads is the same as that used in the Benelux countries? 
  [De Fossa] You have already established close relations with 
the Nordic countries. 
  [Budovski] Yes, these are very warm relations. We have a sea 
in common, the Baltic. In 1992, together with the Council of 
Nordic Countries, we concluded an agreement which is helping us 
resolve very specific problems. 
  In the energy sector, Russia often demands prices which are 
higher than the market prices. Consequently, we are turning 
toward the free market and we are thinking that as far as energy 
is concerned, we will undoubtedly find a solution in Norway. 
  [De Fossa] Why are there still Russian troops in Estonia and 
Latvia? 
  [Budovski] The Russians do not want to answer that question. 
  [De Fossa] How many are there? 
  [Budovski] There are still 2,500 Russian troops in Estonia 
and some 11,000 in Latvia. Sometimes the Russians say that this 
presence guarantees Russia's security, and sometimes they put 
forward the argument of the cost of social support measures in 
the event that these troops are repatriated. Another argument 
they use is that their presence is supposedly required to defend 
the rights of the Russian minority in Latvia. In fact, many 
Russians themselves are wondering why they are still in our 
country. Yet Russia cannot manage to renounce its imperialism. 
The Russians feel that they have been invested with a mission 
vis-a-vis us: They think they have to save us! 
  There is a preliminary agreement concerning the withdrawal 
of 
Russian troops from Latvia. However, one part of Latvian public 
opinion feels that the signing of an agreement is not necessary 
given the fact that the presence of these troops is unlawful. 
As for the Russians, they say that it is not their army, but 
rather the army of the now defunct Soviet Union which is 
responsible for the occupation! In fact, we were colonized. 
They wanted to eliminate us, and that was the doing of officers 
who are now retired and still living in the Baltic countries. 
  [De Fossa] So for you the war is just now ending. 
  [Budovski] For us, in fact, the war has not yet ended 
because 
there are still foreign troops on our soil.

  [Text] Brussels, March 21 (AFP) -- Economics and finance 
ministers of the European Union [EU] called on the U.S. 
authorities here Monday [21 March] to withdraw a proposal which 
would impose special costs on foreign banks operating in the 
United States. 
  They sent a letter protesting against a proposal from the 
Federal Reserve Board that foreign but not local banks should be 
made to pay the cost of stepped-up prudential examinations by 
the U.S. banking authorities. 
  The letter was addressed to Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen, 
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and to various U.S. 
congressmen. It expressed the EU's "serious concerns" at the 
"clearly discriminatory" charges. 
  "We strongly urge the U.S. authorities not to introduce a 
discriminatory examination fee in breach of longstanding 
policy," the letter said. 
  The U.S. authorities have invited public comment on the 
regulations before they are finally promulgated. 
  But the EU ministers said the charges, being aimed 
specifically at foreign banks, flout the "national treatment" 
principles of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD).

  [Text] Brussels, March 21 (AFP) -- France urged here Monday 
[21 March] that the principle of reciprocity should be strictly 
applied during negotiations to include financial services within 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  In a memorandum given to its European Union [EU] partners 
during a meeting of finance ministers, France said the EU should 
pursue "resolutely offensive" policies in concert with the 
United States. 
  Financial services were excluded from the Uruguay Round GATT 
trade accord wrapped up in Geneva last December, mainly because 
of what the United States judged to be insufficient offers from 
Japan and other Asian countries. 
  Negotiations will resume in 1995. The U.S. authorities, in 
the meanwhile, are following a policy of opening up the American 
market only to financial services from countries offering 
similar access. 
  The French memorandum said the EU should maintain similar 
reciprocal pressure in financial services. If the Union failed 
to do so, it would lose a lever to open up foreign markets and 
lose ground to U.S. competition, it said. 
  "We should use the threat of reciprocity to incite countries 
which have commitments to open up their financial services 
markets to undertake the appropriate reforms and indulge in less 
protectionism," it said.

  [Excerpt] Vienna -- Iran has now successfully concluded 
its negotiations with Austria on rescheduling credits with 
Austrian state guarantees. The new agreement will settle the 
repayment of short-term loans of 5.6 billion schillings, 
including the interest accumulated. 
  Austria has granted Iran a suspension of payments for 
outstanding capital until 1 July 1996. At that point, Iran will 
pay back its debts in 16 quarterly installments. As far as the 
accumulated debt is concerned, repayment is to be in 16 monthly 
installments to start on 30 June 1994. On the basis of the 
agreement on Iran's debts, Austrian exporters can now hope for 
new Control Bank guarantees. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with SPOe Chairman Federal Chancellor Franz </F>
Vranitzky by Hubertus Czernin and Herbert Lackner; place and 
date not given: "`Not All of Us Were Kreiskys'"] 
  [Excerpts] [PROFIL] How did you sleep on the night of 13 
March [after the SPOe suffered major losses in the provincial 
elections in Tirol, Salzburg, and Carinthia]? 
  [Vranitzky] Very badly, and not long enough, because I was 
on the telephone until after midnight. 
  [PROFIL] And the fact that, at the time, you had already 
decided that Peter Ambrozy would have to resign as chairman of 
the Carinthian Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPoe], did 
not improve your sleep? 
  [Vranitzky] It did not make the bad results any better. 
  [PROFIL] According to pollsters, four out of five Freedom 
Party of Austria [FPOe] voters said that they had voted for 
Haider's party because the FPOe was exposing the mess produced 
by the big parties. Is this not also a vote that goes beyond 
the context of a provincial election but also has something to 
do with politics at the federal level? 
  [Vranitzky] It is absolutely clear that we cannot say at the 
federal level that we are not affected by the election result. 
Still, I do think that Sunday's elections were first and 
foremost affected by regional affairs. [passage omitted] 
  [PROFIL] Somebody, whom you do not appreciate a lot -- the 
chairman of the FPOe -- undoubtedly managed to win votes from 
groups of people who used to be traditional SPOe supporters. 
One in four FPOe voters is a worker, while this percentage is 
only insignificantly higher for the SPOe. 
  [Vranitzky] This has not least to do with the fact that the 
significance of party work at the grassroots level has 
diminished. It is true that Haider has raised issues that are 
related to workers. Yet, it is equally true that, in reality, 
he is making major pronouncements and promises that can easily 
be weakened or disclosed as half-truths or lies. Yet this 
disclosing is not taking place to a sufficient degree. 
  [PROFIL] This brings up the question whether disclosing such 
things is enough to prevent the voters from supporting Haider in 
the polls. 
  [Vranitzky] It is not the argument alone, it is also the way 
in which such an argument is presented. It is also a question 
of rhetorics and clarity. 
  [PROFIL] People have been voting for Haider for almost eight 
years now. Neither the SPOe nor the Austrian People's Party 
[OeVP] have been able to think up a convincing strategy. 
  [Vranitzky] This is not a purely Austrian phenomenon. The 
progress of civilization does not only produce winners. Those 
who lose or, at least think that they are not among the winners, 
are particularly responsive to those who criticize our 
highly-developed, highly liberal system. 
  [PROFIL] Has the FPOe not meanwhile become too big for the 
others still to maintain that it is nothing but a protest party 
that represents the losers? 
  [Vranitzky] This is not what I said. This group of voters 
has been added to the traditional FPOe voters. 
  [PROFIL] [President of Parliament] Heinz Fischer once said 
that Haider would ultimately win himself to death. Do you see a 
dying man somewhere on the horizon? 
  [Vranitzky] It has become clear that the SPOe's good results 
in surveys at a national level are not a warranty. There is no 
election victory without fighting. Therefore, I do not want to 
deal with the question whether he has won himself to death or 
whether he has reached a ceiling.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister was engaged in an amazing Downing 
Street verbal brawl today with Dr Ian Paisley, in his biggest 
battle yet over the joint peace declaration on Ulster's future. 
Tempers became so frayed that at one point Mr Major banged the 
declaration down on the table in front of him. But officials 
fiercely denied Dr Paisley's claim that Mr Major was "throwing 
papers around." 
  It was the kind of rowdy setback to the Downing Street 
declaration that everyone expected. In fact, some observers 
were astonished that the meeting ran its full 30 minute course. 
They assumed Dr Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, 
would have stormed out within the first few minutes. 
  And there was plainly no prospect that the Prime Minister 
could influence Dr Paisley's implacable stand against the 
declaration and the peace process, which he had already 
denounced as "a sham and a deceit." 
  The meeting was destined to be a shouting match from the 
moment Dr Paisley, and his colleagues, Peter Robinson and 
William McCrea, strode into the Prime Minister's study. It was 
the first "formal" meeting between Mr Major and Dr Paisley since 
the declaration was proclaimed on December 15. 
  The versions of the stormy encounter from Downing Street and 
from Dr Paisley did not tally in all respects -- but what was 
clear from both accounts was that this was the biggest row 
Downing Street has seen for years. Their reports left the 
impression that Dr Paisley was roaring like a bull -- and that 
the Prime Minister's own voice was more than once untypically 
raised in anger. Although this was not the sort of 
confrontation the Prime Minister relishes, there is a widespread 
feeling that he was well-prepared for an onslaught. It will 
make not the slightest difference to his faith in the 
Declaration. 
  In other developments today: 

  -  Northern Ireland Secretary, 
Sir Patrick Mayhew, repeated there could be no negotiations in 
return for a temporary IRA ceasefire; 
  -  Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd, speaking in Dublin, underlined that all-party talks on the 
Province's future still offered the best path to peace, despite 
the Unionist threat to boycott any new discussions. 
  But the Downing Street row dominated. Afterwards, Dr Paisley 
said that Mr Major was "very, very angry." 
  "It was a very rough meeting. I have never seen the Prime 
Minister more angry. I had to raise my voice in order that the 
Prime Minister could hear because he was shouting so loudly," he 
said. 
  Dr Paisley said he urged Mr Major to abandon the declaration 
and made clear he would make it the main issue at the 
Euro-elections in June. The Prime Minister, he said, was 
"throwing papers around -- he must have thrown them around three 
or four times or more." 
  "We served notice on him that we were seeking a mandate from 
the people of Northern Ireland against the joint declaration in 
June," said Dr Paisley. "He said he wanted to have peace. We 
told him that you don't have peace with surrender. He was very, 
very angry. He refused even to listen to the points we were 
making. He abandoned the meeting and said we would have to meet 
again." 
  Dr Paisley described the declaration as "a rotten, sinking 
vessel which is going down now in confusion." 
  Junior Northern Ireland minister Michael Ancram confirmed 
that the meeting was "very frank" and Mr Major made his views 
known "forcibly." He added: "The Prime Minister took Mr Paisley 
to task for misrepresenting the declaration on a number of 
occasions." 
  Downing Street said Dr Paisley handed over a submission, "a 
printed piece of paper about his view of things." Officials 
said he denounced the declaration as "iniquitous" and utterly 
rejected it as a "farce" -- a description the Prime Minister 
called "rubbish." 
  And as Dr Paisley continued to condemn the declaration, the 
Prime Minister took the opportunity to point out that he had a 
mandate from the people of the United Kingdom. Mr Major said 
they wanted all the constitutional parties to take part in the 
talks. 
  Dr Paisley and Mr Robinson continued expressing their 
hostility to the declaration "in rather loud terms." 
  The Prime Minister said he had been very patient with Dr 
Paisley but had had enough of listening to his misrepresentation 
of the declaration. "Dr Paisley continued to misrepresent the 
declaration and Mr Robinson then accused the Prime Minister of 
giving way to violence. The Prime Minister retorted by saying 
how could he justify that statement when the Government 
maintained nearly 20,000 troops in Northern Ireland." 
  Mr Major was said to have been "very calm, very firm, 
extremely tough and vigorous." But officials afterwards claimed 
it was probably salutary that Dr Paisley had been given a 
"correct interpretation" of the declaration. 
  Mr Hurd, said after hour-long talks in Dublin with Irish 
Foreign Minister Dick Spring that fresh talks were "the only way 
in which progress was going to be likely." He said: "We all 
know this is a difficult path and that it will not be easy. 
That has been proved over and over again. But the status 
quo...is not acceptable either. We all have a duty to find ways 
of making progress. And we -- the two governments -- believe 
the talks offer the best way. So we intend to pursue that path." 
  Mr Hurd said the peace declaration was not a "bargaining 
offer." 
  And Sir Patrick repeated that there could be no negotiations 
in return for a temporary IRA ceasefire. A temporary ceasefire 
carried the risk that the terrorists would start their campaign 
again, he said in Newcastle, Co [County] Down.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Michel Rosten: "No One Is a Prophet in His </F>
Own Home..."] 
  [Text] Our political personnel do not enjoy the best of 
reputations in the country. They are easily denounced for good 
and notso good reasons. In contrast, some of them are 
recognized abroad for their true value. It is known how much 
credit and prestige Belgium has won from the activities of 
Paul-Henri Spaak, Pierre Harmel or Leo Tindemans on the 
contemporary international stage. Today it would be wrong to 
think that these exceptional men do not have any rivals. 
  At the forefront of them is the prime minister himself. 
Dehaene has been mentioned recently as a possible successor to 
Delors. This information has led to loud cries in the swamp of 
national politics because the head of government has become 
"irreplaceable" it appears. In contrast to various rumors, fed 
by those who are attached to the delicate balance in the 
coalition, the CVP [Christian People's Party] locomotive would 
appreciate having a signal box placing it on the European track. 
Within the party, reliable sources say, some people are pushing 
him to take advantage if this possibility arises. For the 
moment the prime minister is guaranteed the support of Francois 
Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl. However, the chancellor could be 
discovering a vocation himself, which is said to be growing 
inversly to the reduction in his chances of staying in power 
after the parliamentary elections, and is considering 
establishing himself in Brussels ... 
  There is another CVP man who seems destined for an 
international career if Dehaene does not take over the 
Commission presidency: Mark Eyskens has a very good chance of 
becoming secretary general of the WEU, which could also give him 
the deputy general secretary position of NATO on the same 
occasion, since the two organizations are planning to establish 
mutual links. 
  And since we are discussing NATO, how could one not mention 
that Willy Claes is starting to be cited as a successor to 
Manfred Woerner. In the interest of change, the Alliance is 
thinking of calling on a moderate socialist who enjoys the full 
confidence of Washington. A German cannot take over from a 
compatriot. In Italy it is not easy to find a socialist who is 
not being bothered by the Justice Ministry. It is premature to 
think of a Frenchman. The British Labor Party has a label as 
pacifists. Therefore ...

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lubbers Calls For Reintroduction of </F>
Border Checks"] 
  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Lubbers wants to reintroduce 
personal identity checks at the frontiers with Germany and 
Belgium. He said this was necessary to reduce the increasing 
numbers of asylum-seekers (who have no prospects for life) 
entering the Netherlands via these countries. Lubbers spoke of 
an "administrative emergency situation." 
  In a confidential letter to his fellow ministers on Monday 
14 
March the prime minister said among other things that 
"difficulties with expulsion (of rejected asylum-seekers, etc.) 
make it necessary to stop them from entering the Netherlands." 
The prime minister's proposal diverges from the intention to 
achieve open borders within Europe. Lubbers said this measure 
was necessary because the Schengen Treaty, which would oblige 
Germany to take back asylum-seekers, was not yet applicable. 
"What is involved is fixed check points and flying brigades in 
border areas, which must be reintroduced, at least until 
Schengen has actually taken effect," Lubbers wrote. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lubbers Calls For Asylum-Seekers To </F>
Be Received in Their Own Region"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- Refugees from the former Yugoslavia 
could be received best in their own region, Prime Minister 
Lubbers said. Speaking after Friday's [18 March] cabinet 
meeting, he said that it was better for the war refugees 
themselves to be received in Macedonia for example, rather than 
in the Netherlands. "After all that is ideal," he said. "The 
same language, the same customs." 
  Lubbers said that the cabinet wanted to make more money 
available to expand reception capacity in the region. The prime 
minister referred to the reception of East Africans in the 
Middle East as a second example of the reception of refugees in 
their own region. "It is good that the world is accepting 
Somali, but why does that have to happen on humid Netherlands 
soil?" he said. "After all, would that not be better in Saudi 
Arabia or Yemen? For example they have the same religion there." 
  On Friday the cabinet agreed with the Justice Ministry plan 
to stop and send back asylum-seekers entering the Netherlands 
overland as quickly as possible after they cross the border. 
These refugees will usually be told that they must apply for 
asylum in the so-called first country of reception. This refers 
to the first of the 22 member states of the Council of Europe 
which the asylum-seeker entered. 
  The decision copies one of the underlying measures of the 
Schengen Treaty. Because the Netherlands is "closed off" by the 
Schengen countries Belgium and Germany, asylum-seekers who come 
overland are to no longer be granted asylum in the Netherlands. 
But because this would put an unfair burden on Germany in 
particular, agreements will have to be made in a European 
context about a fair distribution, Lubbers said. 
  Lubbers gave a cautious answer to the question of whether he 
thought it was sensible for Housing State Secretary Heerma to 
talk in parliament this week about the possibility of perhaps 
70,000- 80,000 asylum-seekers coming to the Netherlands this 
year. "Mentioning these figures could have a dramatic effect," 
the prime minister said. "But neither could the cabinet walk 
away from the facts," he said. "And these facts are that partly 
because of tighter asylum policies in Germany, more 
asylum-seekers are coming to the Netherlands."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kooijmans Criticizes States for </F>
Disregarding Human Rights"] 
  [Text] "States that appeal to exceptions to the rule of 
universal human rights go against the will of the people. By 
withholding specific inalienable rights, a country is 
discredited as being a democracy. The main feature of democracy 
is that the government always exercises power on behalf of and 
in the interests of the people." Those statements were made by 
Foreign Minister Kooijmans in a speech at the University of Lund 
in Sweden on Thursday [17 March]. 
  As a human rights specialist, Kooijmans took a stance, more 
clearly than before, against some Asian countries such as 
Indonesia, where he will be traveling with Prime Minister 
Lubbers next month. Indonesia is one of those countries that 
maintains that human rights are not universal. According to 
them, the rights of the people must be seen against the 
historical, social, and cultural background of the country or 
region concerned. 
  According to Kooijmans, this actually means that "human 
rights are not identical for all." A government could then deny 
any accusation of torture or ill-treatment of its citizens by 
saying that people always have been tortured or ill-treated. 
Also, they could allege that torture is part of the local 
culture and that it thus should be seen as a national 
"particularity" which legalizes the "exception" to the rule 
according to which torture is banned.

<F P=106> ["H. V."-initialled report: "1,049 Weapons Seized -- `Clear </F>
Warning to International Criminals'"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Minister of the Chancellery Friedrich Bohl 
(Christian Democratic Union) assesses the result of the first 
nationwide search operation against illegal owners of weapons as 
"proof of successful police cooperation within the European 
Union." 
  "Interpol, the Belgian police authorities, and the Federal 
Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] have proved their 
joining effectiveness," Bohl told WELT AM SONNTAG. 
  According to a now available balance sheet of a large-scale 
search in 420 German towns, which was conducted the week before 
last, a total of 1,049 weapons were seized, including seven 
submachine guns and three fully automatic guns. In addition, 
2.5 tonnes of ammunition as well as five hand grenades with 
accessories were found. 
  Most of the weapons came from Belgium. Twelve suspects were 
arrested and two arrest warrants were issued. 
  Said Minister Bohl: "This successful operation is a clear 
warning to international criminals. Uniting the police forces 
leads to determined operations and greater security. An 
abolition of border checks is by far not tantamount to freedom 
of international crime. I congratulate the official of 
Interpol, of the BKA, and of the laender police forces on their 
success." 
  A total of 2,247 federal and land official were involved in 
the police operations in all laender. 
  A total of 754 apartments of 724 persons were searched, who 
are suspected of having brought weapons to Germany illegally -- 
in particular from Belgium -- and having sold some of them 
already. 
  The occasion of the search in the FRG was information 
provided by Interpol in Brussels to the BKA in Wiesbaden. 
  Last November and December, Interpol had provided 
information 
on 1,082 cases of the purchase of guns by German citizens in 
Belgium. 
  Minister Friedrich Bohl announced that the European police 
authorities have already increased their exchange of information 
considerably. This is an "advance measure" regarding planned 
"bolstering measures" within the framework of the abolition of 
borders. Bohl: "The European registration service already 
works before it is officially introduced. This is now paying 
off." 
  The minister announced that, when it takes over the 
presidency of the European Union as of July, the Federal 
Government will make a special contribution so that the European 
Union can combat international crime with determination as a 
"security community." Bohl: "In addition, cooperation between 
the judicial, security, and customs authorities of the member 
states must be improved in such a way that the latest success 
against the arms smugglers becomes a normal part of everyday 
police life in Europe."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "FDP Fighting Over Coalition </F>
Statement"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- A week after the defeat in the Lower Saxony 
Landtag elections, a controversy has erupted within the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] over its coalition statement 
for the Bundestag elections. At the weekend, several leading 
FDP politicians demanded that the party make a quick statement 
in favor of its current coalition partner, the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. 
  At the Hesse FDP party conference in Melsungen, land 
Chairman 
Wolfgang Gerhardt warned his party not to "behave like a flock 
of chickens and ask about a new coalition," following the 
party's failure to pass the 5-percent hurdle in the Lower Saxony 
elections. The FDP cannot make politics with the "old Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]." Bundestag Group Chairman 
Hermann-Otto Solms also spoke out clearly against an alliance 
with the SPD. Speaking to DIE WELT, Solms said he cannot 
imagine any other coalition than the existing one. This is 
clearly the position of the majority within the FDP. A final 
decision can, however, only be made by the party conference in 
September. 
  Juergen Moellemann, chairman of the biggest FDP land 
organization in North Rhine-Westphalia, on the other hand, 
called upon his party to free itself from the "downward trend of 
the CDU/CSU." The FDP will have to sharpen its own profile over 
the next few months. The former economics minister said that 
stopping the "soaring public indebtedness" must have top 
priority at the moment. FDP presidential candidate Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher made a statement to similar effect. Speaking on 
Deutschlandfunk radio, she warned against a "complete" 
commitment for an alliance with the CDU/CSU. The FDP must not 
"get itself into a cul-de-sac." If the election results are 
accordingly, the Bonn coalition should be continued. But the FDP 
must also take responsibility in the event of other 
constellations, be it as opposition or in a coalition with a 
different partner. 
  FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel demanded an end to the coalition 
debate. The party must not let itself be driven into an early 
commitment. Yet, in the upcoming election campaigns, the FDP 
will have to draw a more distinct line to its partner in 
government. 
  CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble has 
urged 
the FDP to make a quick coalition statement in favor of the 
CDU/CSU. The Lower Saxony land parliament elections have shown 
that an unclear position about its future course has disastrous 
effects on the FDP, Schaeuble said.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Tissy Bruns </F>
and Hans Monath; place and date not given: "We Want To Become 
the Strongest Force"] 
  [Text] [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Scharping, you are the 
success of the year. However, there are objections to you in 
part of the political spectrum -- above all among those whom the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] wanted to reach in the 
eighties. 
  [Scharping] I do not see it in this way. According to the 
polls, the SPD has stabilized at 40 percent. This is a good 
starting position, which is also confirmed by the election 
result in Lower Saxony. If the question is aimed at the 
occasional criticism that topics like equal status for women, 
the protection of the natural foundations of life, or others are 
receding into the background, this is not correct. They are 
only increasingly related to the main social problem: the 
combating of unemployment and the reestablishment of social 
justice. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] However, these topics are not identical. 
A topical example: The government program retreats on the 
demand for a general speed limit and is not very specific about 
a gasoline price increase. 
  [Scharping] The exciting question is how an ecologically 
tolerable traffic policy is to be drawn up. Regarding 
consumption, one has to provide the car industry with incentives 
and, at the same time, with reliable basic conditions, so that a 
reduction in so-called car fleet consumption becomes possible. 
First of all, this is a matter of technical progress. 
Regarding the speed limit, differentiated solutions that are in 
keeping with the situation will be required. It is not very 
imaginative to put up a sign with a speed limit everywhere. In 
exclusively residential areas the speed limit of 30 km per hour 
is appropriate and the municipalities have to be enabled to push 
it through. A speed of 90 or 100 km per hour is appropriate on 
highways, and on superhighways the location of the driver, the 
traffic density, and the traffic burden make a difference. A 
four-lane superhighway near a city is different from a six-lane 
one somewhere in the country. We have an increasing number of 
technical opportunities to react appropriately to these 
different situations. We do not exclude the speed limit from 
the program -- in no way. But a simple yes or no to the speed 
limit results in a discussion on symbols, and symbolic debates 
are usually rather fruitless. I give you an example: The Land 
of Rhineland- Palatinate has always been suspected of opposing 
the speed limit. In fact, there is a speed limit on 40 percent 
of the superhighways in Rhineland-Palatinate, which is more than 
in any other land, and their experience regarding accident rates 
is very good. If this is flexibly handled, technical 
possibilities and the people's sense of responsibility can be 
usefully combined. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] You have given the country your three 
topics: Work, work, work. When we hear the SPD talk about 
ecology today, it often sounds like an appendage. 
  [Scharping] Then I recommend you to listen more closely. 
Economy and ecology are inseparable components of the 
development of the future. One must not create an artificial 
contradiction between them. They are integrated, interrelated, 
and unrenounceable components of the future development. 
Economic development means growth that is in line with the 
environment, but also the modernization of the social state, the 
reduction of labor costs, and an intelligent organization of 
work. There are people who believe that the economic 
development could be more or less pursued from an Archimedean 
point. I think that this is a rather primitive way of thinking 
in a highly complicated and strongly intertwined society where 
labor is divided. A point from which the whole complex 
development can be advanced does not exist. 
  I want to give an example. At the end of the sixties, the 
law on stability and growth was very much discussed in Germany. 
More precisely: The magic quadrilateral was constantly 
discussed because Karl Schiller had invented the formula of the 
magic quadrilateral. It consisted of price stability, a balance 
in foreign trade, full employment, and adequate economic growth. 
It must be possible today to count at least up to three. That 
is, modernization of the economy, intelligent organization of 
work, and modernization of the activities of the state, 
including the social state. This has to be translated into 
reality. Ecologically oriented growth is an integral part of 
the modernization of the economy. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] You want a leaner state and commit 
yourself to the framework in the government program: no 
increase in the state quota and no increase in the state debts. 
You would be a chancellor of the crisis. Do you think that 
there are also chances in the crisis? 
  [Scharping] Crisis? Let us rather talk of challenges. 
First of all, ecological growth and, second, chances for the 
modernization of the activities of the state. What is the 
state? From my point of view, it has to guarantee the civilized 
coexistence of people on the foundation of basic values and 
basic rights and it has to guarantee the equality of 
opportunities. 
  Whatever aspects may be taken -- social differences or equal 
status for men and women -- I always come to the same result: 
It is the task of the state to make a civilized coexistence 
possible. It creates the framework for private initiative, also 
for a private sense of responsibility toward the community, and 
it has to provide equal opportunities. 
  However, this part of the state's activity is only accepted 
if the citizens know and can trust that the state will use the 
means entrusted to it in the most cost-advantageous and just way 
possible. All three aspects, justice, efficiency, and 
cost-consciousness, are grossly neglected at present. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Only by the Kohl government? 
  [Scharping] By the present government policy and by a social 
trend that has developed all virtues of "I" considerably more 
than the virtues of "we." A new balance has to be found. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] The virtues of "we" include the 
preparedness for sharing. This cannot be ordered from above. 
Is national feeling required for it today? 
  [Scharping] No, not at all. A sense of responsibility is 
required, as well as the ability to put the striving for one's 
happiness into a joint context. Everyone has the moral 
obligation to contribute to the public welfare, the preamble to 
the Hamburg constitution says. One could also quote Kant's 
categorical imperative or Thomas Aquinas' four basic virtues. 
Whatever it may be -- civilized societies cannot manage without 
the harmony of freedom, equality, and fraternity. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] But this does not explain why I am 
supposed to pay surcharges for people in the new laender and not 
for people in Portugal. 
  [Scharping] I would not propose that to anyone. It would be 
an absurd undertaking to play Germany's inner development off 
against global questions of underdevelopment, the protection of 
human rights, or environmental protection on a global scale. 
But the opposite must not be done either. Aggression develops 
from the social problems in Germany, from fear, hopelessness, 
and the concern about jobs. Xenophobia, the hatred for 
minorities, and the disregard of other cultures develop from 
aggression. Precisely those who are interested in 
multiculturalism, the respect for other opinions, and social 
tolerance ought to advocate economic stability and social 
justice all the more. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] This sounds good.... 
  [Scharping] It not only sounds good. It is the truth. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] The Greens would immediately support the 
concepts of tolerance and multiculturalism. Can you envisage a 
Green foreign minister? 
  [Scharping] I will not hold any debates on a coalition, not 
even on the sly. There will only be a political change in 
Germany if the SPD clearly becomes stronger. But I add the 
following: Policies cannot be made with trivial nonsense -- the 
dissolution of the Bundeswehr and NATO, the immediate 
introduction of a gasoline price of 5 German marks per liter. 
Nor will the Greens' reliability increase if their leading 
representatives state immediately after a party congress where 
such resolutions were adopted that they are not so serious. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Have you therefore already eliminated a 
possible coalition partner? 
  [Scharping] Once again: I do not hold any debates on 
coalitions. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Scharping, we have not even asked you 
a question about a coalition.... 
  [Scharping] You asked whether I eliminate anyone. I only 
rule out one thing, that is, a grand coalition. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] There is no doubt that you will need a 
coalition partner. Thus, we are interested in your judgment of 
the eligible candidates. 
  [Scharping] We can calmly wait for all that. Just like the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP], the Greens are political opponents. Of 
course, I want to convince many of those who have so far voted 
for the Greens in the same way as others who have voted for the 
CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] or the FDP so far. I value the 
voters of all other parties. I have the firm impression that 
the supply of possible coalitions will be greater than the 
demand. Expressed in terms of the market economy, this, of 
course, reduces the price. We want to become the strongest 
force. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] We give up, and express our interest in 
the plans of the strongest force. Did you start too early? 
Your topic of work has been taken up by all parties. Now 
people are asking about concrete alternatives to the SPD. 
  [Scharping] At any rate, the concern of the CDU/CSU about 
the possible loss of government responsibility is perceptible 
for the first time. This is justified and good from my point of 
view and even urgently necessary from a general point of view. 
This party has to be replaced because there is nobody who is so 
much to blame for economic mistakes, the highest mass 
unemployment rate, bitter social injustice, and the apparent 
financial crisis of the state. In the first place, and for me 
the most important, it has lost the direct and immediate basic 
political capital, that is, confidence. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Will the slight economic upswing turn the 
tables once again? The CDU/CSU is banking on it. 
  [Scharping] But what do we have in this field? 
Unfortunately, I add immediately. In December 1993 there was a 
sharp decline, particularly in the field of industrial 
production. Now there are slight improvements, as compared to a 
very bad year. This is to be explicitly welcomed and even more 
so if the tender shoots of growth were even more ecologically 
oriented. However, everyone knows that we would need a growth 
of at least 1.5 percent or rather of 2 percent for the labor 
market to move. Unfortunately, we will not achieve this growth 
in the course of 1994. If this trivial economic policy, which 
is completely uncertain for the enterprises that make 
investments and hardly reliable, is not changed, nothing new 
will develop. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] What does your program tell the voters: 
The SPD does the following three things differently and better? 
  [Scharping] The economic and labor market policy, the social 
policy, including help for families with children, and 
distribution of burdens for inner unity. To start with the 
last: The financial contributions to inner unity, which I 
explicitly believe to be right, must not continue to be settled 
at the expense of the employees and the wage- and 
employment-intensive enterprises. For this destroys and impairs 
the competitiveness of the medium-sized enterprises and craft 
industries. Most of the innovations come from there, most of 
the jobs are there -- that is, 50 percent -- and 70 percent of 
the training takes place there. Thus, we are damaging our 
economic future and social justice if we continue the usual 
financing via solidarity funds and ancillary wage costs. With 
all that, it is completely clear that the tax and rate quota to 
be reached in 1995 must not be changed. However, within this 
framework, there must be shifts because of economic reason and 
social justice. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Let us come to the topic of foreign 
policy. You said at the security conference there are no real 
differences to that of the FRG Government. The Federal 
Government presented a white book that provides for crisis 
reaction forces for missions all over the world. The SPD 
resolution was: No combat missions. Which is correct? 
  [Scharping] There are no differences in the basic 
orientations: European integration, transatlantic partnership, 
reliable and, if possible, friendly relations with the Eastern 
states. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Combat missions: yes or no -- this is 
also a basic question. 
  [Scharping] Regarding the combat missions, there is a clear 
dividing line and a massive conflict between the SPD and the 
government parties. We want to be a UN member, protect our 
rights, and fulfill our duties there. We are sovereign in the 
decision on how we will do this. Therefore, the Social 
Democrats say: Strengthening the United Nations, yes to 
peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The resolution adopted 
at the Wiesbaden party congress draws a line that we will not 
cross: No actions like the Gulf war. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITING] If you become chancellor, how will you 
celebrate 8 May 1995? 
  [Scharping] As a day that freed Germany from fascism.

<F P=106> [Heinz Vielain report: "Scharping's Tax Plans Meet With </F>
Criticism of SPD and DGB"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The proposal by Rudolf Scharping, the 
candidate of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] for chancellor, 
to classify even taxpayers with a monthly gross income of 3,845 
German marks [DM] (this means a net income of DM2,500 in the 
worst case) as "high-wage earners" has met with lack of 
comprehension and criticism even in the SPD and the German Trade 
Union Federation [DGB]. At a regional congress of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] in Schwerin Chancellor Helmut Kohl called 
Scharping's tax plans "absurd." 
  Scharping wants to present the draft of his government 
program to the SPD Executive Committee on Monday [21 March], 
after he has presented it to the public at a news conference in 
Bonn on Friday. 
  Concerning the SPD program presented by Scharping, 
Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl told WELT AM SONNTAG: "The Social Democrats have 
not learned anything. If one puts a supplementary tax of 10 
percent on those people who work hardest, and these are skilled 
workers, one must ask how the structural problems in our country 
are supposed to be overcome, if all who `push' the whole thing 
and also those on whom one relies are now punished, as is 
envisaged in the SPD program." 
  Scharping's draft for the SPD government program envisages 
that high-wage earners are generally taxed more -- with, among 
other things, a 10-percent surcharge on payroll and income tax 
owed, which is to be levied from singles with a gross annual 
income of more than DM50,000 and married couples with a gross 
income of more than DM100,000. 
  Deputy SPD Bundestag Group Chairman Rudolf Dressler rejects 
this point of Scharping's proposal and, instead, demands raising 
the computation basis for the planned supplementary tax to an 
annual gross income of DM60,000 for singles and DM120,000 for 
married couples. Dressler reminded Scharping that last year, on 
the occasion of the negotiations on the Solidarity Pact, the SPD 
had given higher computation bases. 
  DGB Chairman Heinz-Werner Meyer also demanded raising the 
computation bases to DM60,000 for singles and DM120,000 for 
married couples as a minimum. According to Meyer, he would have 
preferred the SPD to agree on these limits. Then a dispute with 
the trade unions could have been avoided. 
  Particularly harsh criticism comes from the Taxpayers' 
Association, which categorically rejects Scharping's plan for a 
supplementary tax. Deputy Chairman Dieter Lau called the SPD 
chancellor candidate's ideas an "infamous plan." The infamous 
thing is that it is pretended that there are enough high-wage 
earners, who can be burdened with this tax. In reality, the 
majority of the Germans are burdened with new taxes, he said. 
  The CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group noted 
that the SPD chief obviously "does not leave anyone untouched." 
Its parliamentary manager, Juergen Ruettgers, told WELT AM 
SONNTAG, commenting on the demand for a 10-percent supplementary 
tax: "In short, this means that anyone who earns DM50,000 as a 
single -- in gross terms that is DM3,845 per month -- or 
DM100,000 as a married couple, is to pay 10 percent more in 
taxes. This affects more than 2.3 million working people in 
Germany. These include not only the so-called high-wage earners 
but also skilled workers, engineering and commercial employees, 
master craftsmen, traders, and self-employed people." 
  Michael Glos, chairman of the CSU land group in the 
Bundestag, told WELT AM SONNTAG that the SPD's government 
program planned by Scharping makes it clear that Scharping wants 
to "force" the citizens under the "tax whip" with this 
supplementary tax. Glos: "Instead of promoting readiness to pay 
taxes, those who do most in our society are to be systematically 
plundered." 
  For the FDP its economic policy spokesman, Otto Graf 
Lambsdorff, told WELT AM SONNTAG: "Scharping wants to soak 
people and he is making contortions like an eel to do it. He 
will have to begin with the skilled worker and the small retail 
trader, if he wants to get large amounts of money. Almost one 
out of five taxpayers earns more than DM75,000 per year. These 
`high-wage earners' are already paying 90 percent of the entire 
payroll and income tax."

  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party [SPD]

March]. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leading representatives 
of the coalition categorically rejected the plan to introduce a 
supplementary tax of 10 percent of the income tax on annual 
salaries of up to 50,000 German marks [DM] for singles and 
DM100,000 for married couples. In contrast, SPD Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping defended the concept. His deputy, Oskar Lafontaine, 
for his part, accused the government of planning further tax 
increases. The government denied this. 
  Scharping rejected criticism of the planned supplementary 
tax 
as "wretched propaganda." Anyone who talks about "destroying 
the readiness to work hard in Germany," is "not quite normal," 
Scharping told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. The difference between the 
solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent of their income tax, which 
is planned by the coalition, and the supplementary tax, is 
small. For a citizen with a monthly gross income of DM8,000 it 
is only DM50. "I think that this is bearable; I do not expect 
enthusiasm but understanding," the SPD chairman said. He said 
that the coalition's claim that higher taxes make people less 
willing to work hard a "completely trite and stupid theory." 
Over the past years the upper income echelons have experienced 
a considerable easing of burdens. If this had significantly 
raised people's willingness to work hard, one should not be in 
the most profound economic crisis since the end of the war now.

<F P=106> ["ban" report: "SPD Executive Committee Approves </F>
Scharping's Financial Plans"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 21 Mar -- At the meeting of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Executive Committee on Monday 
[22 March], SPD Chairman Scharping received support for his 
course of financial consolidation, as set down in his draft of a 
government program. In the SPD leadership it was said that at 
the Executive Committee meeting Scharping primarily insisted 
that his "financial policy guidelines" be supported. This means 
Scharping's promise that an SPD-led federal government will not 
raise the tax quota or net borrowing, within this framework 
there is to be redistribution at the cost of high-wage earners, 
the growth of the federal budget should be below that of the 
nominal GNP. According to SPD Federal Manager Verheugen, these 
"basic values" presented by Scharping were not contradicted in 
the SPD Executive Committee. The Executive Committee discussed 
the debate about income thresholds for a supplementary tax. 
Verheugen said that in the Executive Committee there was 
"complete agreement" that the planned solidarity surcharge of 
7.5 percent for all, which the Federal Government is planning, 
is to be rejected as unsocial. He said that the income 
threshold of 50,000/100,000 German marks [DM] (single 
people/married couples) does not refer to the gross income but 
to the taxable income. According to SPD calculations, this would 
affect 17.5 percent of single people, but 82.5 percent would be 
better off; 14.4 percent of married couples would be [adversely] 
affected but 85.6 percent would be better off. Verheugen stated 
that, following these explanations, there were no controversies 
about this matter in the Executive Committee. 
  In the SPD it was recalled that Scharping had not committed 
himself to any detail. Last Friday the SPD chairman spoke of an 
income threshold of DM50,000/DM100,000 (single people/married 
couples), using "may" and said: "Whether this is done will be 
decided by further deliberations." The matter must be seen "in 
connection" with other financial policy projects. On Monday SPD 
officials said that it is still open whether the demand for a 
10-percent supplementary tax to replace the 7.5 percent 
solidarity surcharge planned by the coalition is to be included 
in the election campaign program. Scharping's advisers have 
warned against including such details, which might prove null 
and void after a stocktaking of the actual financial situation 
of the Federal Government. For this reason, Scharping wants to 
avoid giving detailed figures in the election program. 
  The SPD Executive Committee for the first time discussed the 
draft, which was formulated under the leadership of Scharping 
and his deputy Lafontaine. The final vote in the Executive 
Committee is to be taken on 2 May, following discussions within 
the party; the draft formulated by this process is to be passed 
on as a motion for a resolution to the delegates of the SPD 
Congress in Halle on 22 June. 
  Before the SPD Executive Committee meeting began on Monday 
at 
noon, the members of the body avoided continuing the public 
debate that had started on the weekend. Lower Saxony 
Minister-President Schroeder (SPD) was heard saying that he 
considers the tax plans "highly sensible." Scharping said that 
it is better to have a debate now than later. After DGB [German 
Trade Union Federation] Chairman Meyer, who was once an SPD 
Bundestag deputy, stated on the weekend that the income 
threshold planned by Scharping is too low, Mr. Rappe, chairman 
of the Chemical Industry Trade Union and SPD Bundestag deputy, 
also voiced his concern on Monday. 
  At the Executive Committee meeting Baden-Wuerttemberg 
Environment Minister Schaefer (SPD) came out against a 
renunciation of a general speed limit, as envisaged in the draft 
of the election program. Schafer said that both energy policy 
and traffic policy favor a general speed limit. On the weekend 
the election program draft was criticized by the Federal 
Congress of Young Socialists in Herne. The draft is "boring and 
without prospects." The Congress called for a red-green 
coalition. "Our goal is the immediate opting out of nuclear 
energy." The Young Socialists passed resolutions calling for 
the "immediate abolition of compulsory military service." The 
goal is "an FRG without an army" within eight years. Deputy DAG 
[German Employees' Trade Union] Chairwoman Konitzer came out 
against the income threshold mentioned by Scharping for a 
supplementary tax; she called for thresholds of 
DM80,000/DM160,000. Mr. Fuchs, the chairman of the Federation 
of German Wholesale and Foreign Trade, criticized both the SPD 
proposals and the solidarity surcharge planned by the coalition.

<F P=106> [Torsten Knoedler report: "Managers Appreciate Kohl More </F>
Than Scharping"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Two-thirds of the German managers from 
industry, politics, and administration are dissatisfied with the 
Federal Government's economic policy. This is the result of a 
representative poll by the Allensbach Public Opinion Research 
Institute. Nevertheless, given a choice between Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) and Rudolf Scharping, 
his challengers from the Social Democratic Party of Germany, 63 
percent would choose Kohl and only 23 percent Scharping. 
  More than two-thirds (68 percent) of those polled demand 
from 
the Federal Government "massive support" for German exports. 
"Not as the chief seller. But we want more political support 
as chief establisher of contacts," Tyll Necker, president of the 
Federation of German Industry (BDI), said yesterday at the 
presentation of the "elite panel" ordered by the economic 
magazine CAPITAL. 
  "The government is to reestablish equal starting 
opportunities in international competition," Necker said in an 
interview with DIE WELT. An essential part of the economic 
problems are homemade because of the cost crisis, the excessive 
regulations, and the skepticism concerning technology: "The 
others have become better and we have become more expensive." 
  Six of 10 of the 650 polled managers are, however, also of 
the view that the Germans are "too naive and clumsy" in foreign 
business. A total of 52 percent of the German managers think 
that Germany has fallen back in technology. 
  Germany's economic prospects are assessed largely 
positively: 
42 percent (40 percent in September 1993) in the old laender 
and 39 percent (30) in the new laender expect the economic 
development to recover. 
  In the view of 66 percent of the managers, the FRG will play 
a greater role in international politics in the future. A total 
of 78 percent of those polled think that "fear of a stronger 
Germany is unfounded." Good relations with the United States 
(97 percent) and with France (95 percent) are cited as the two 
most important foreign policy goals. 
  In an international comparison of salaries for 1993 the 
German managers occupied first place with an average annual 
gross income of 443,000 marks (including a percentage of annual 
profits).

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bavaria -- Grand Coalition the Only </F>
Solution?"] 
  [Text] For decades, the Christian Social Union [CSU] has 
governed Bavaria with big absolute majorities. After the next 
land parliament election, it might have to clear some of the 
ministers' seats for the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD]. According to a poll conducted for BILD AM SONNTAG by the 
Forsa Institute, the CSU will lose so many votes that the only 
possibility for Bavaria might be a grand coalition. While the 
CSU is still slightly ahead of the SPD on the land level, it 
would only come second in Bavaria in Bundestag elections. 
  Last Thursday [17 March] and Friday, Forsa asked 609 
Bavarian 
voters: For which party would you vote if land parliament or 
Bundestag elections were held on Sunday? In both cases, the CSU 
achieved less than 40 percent. The Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP] might not get back into the land parliament in 
Bavaria either. But even if the Liberals manage to get over the 
5-percent hurdle -- a coalition with the CSU would not get a 
majority. The Greens/Alliance 90 and the Republikaner are too 
strong -- and the CSU would certainly not form a coalition with 
them. This only leaves the SPD as partner. 
  The main reason why the CSU is experiencing such a decline 
with the voters is obvious: It is the affairs surrounding its 
top politicians Streibl, Gauweiler, and Tandler. Asked to name 
the biggest problems in Bavaria, 53 percent mentioned 
unemployment, and as many as 38 percent said "scandals and 
politicians." Other issues, such as the housing shortage or 
crime, play only a minor role. 
  Are the CSU's chances of being elected getting any worse on 
account of the Amigo affair? There is a clear answer to this as 
well: Of those asked, 73 percent said yes, only 19 percent do 
not thinks so, and 8 percent do not have any opinion on the 
matter. 
  Is Minister-President Edmund Stoiber in a position to start 
afresh in Bavarian politics, without scandals? Of those asked, 
58 percent think he cannot do it. Only 27 percent think Stoiber 
is capable of making a scandal-free new start. 
  A total of 39 percent of the voters prefer Stoiber to his 
SPD 
competitor Renate Schmidt, who would get 35 percent of the 
votes. Among CSU supporters, the minister-president is clearly 
ahead with an 80-percent approval rating, with only 68 percent 
of SPD voters approving of Ms. Schmidt. 
  With regard to Bavaria, the CSU still has a "land bonus" due 
to its experience in government. This is why things look 
brighter here than at the Bundestag elections, where SPD 
Chairman Scharping can hope to win 45 percent of the Bavarian 
votes, while CSU Chairman Waigel could offer his chancellor only 
a small dowry of 37 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by Roswin Finkenzeller: "Stoiber: Moral Rigor Must </F>
Not Be Exaggerated"] 
  [Text] Deggendorf, 20 Mar -- The Christian Social Union 
[CSU] is not the Bavarian Social Democratic Party [SPD]. If it 
were, its so-called small party conference would mainly have 
discussed the party's recent stroke of bad luck, with a number 
of affairs going on before the beginning of three election 
campaigns. Most of the CSU party committee members, however, 
avoided touching on the worrying issue in front of switched-on 
microphones. And when the subject was mentioned in Deggendorf, 
much of what was said did not really sound like defense, but 
more like heart-searching. Landtag Group Chairman Glueck not 
only accepted that the parties had the role of a "lightning 
rod," but he also acknowledged the particularly strict standards 
applied to politicians. Party Chairman Waigel complained that 
the party of Lafontaine and Stolpe is viewed more tolerantly 
than the CSU, but he also said that it is "the politicians' task 
to be examples." The Christian image of man induced Secretary 
General Huber to the insight: "We have faults and 
imperfections. We are not angels." Yet, he called upon his 
party colleagues "not to give in morally to the opposition and 
the press." 
  Minister-President Stoiber promised "investigations" into 
the 
dubious matters, as had been "my highest principle in dealing 
with these problems" since he took office a year ago. But on 
the other hand, he admitted, maybe also beating his own breast: 
"Moral rigor must not be exaggerated." He strongly rejected 
the SPD's comparing the CSU with the Mafia, because one cannot 
condemn an entire group because one or the other of its members 
does something wrong. Also, he warned the CSU not to be tricked 
by the suggestion to move away from the Strauss traditions in 
order to be saved. In spite of all human weaknesses, Strauss 
achieved great things for Bavaria and the CSU, and this course 
must be continued. Thus, in the upcoming election campaigns, 
the women and men of the CSU must simply "present themselves as 
the more competent people." 
  He also warned against another trap. He could have referred 
to it asking where the desirable rootedness ends and damnable 
nepotism starts in the relationship between parties and the 
population. In Deggendorf he mentioned a "businessman from 
Pfarrkirchen" who had once given the CSU 500 German marks and 
now has "problems with social regulations," for which he turned 
to his deputy. The minister-president described for himself and 
for the audience how the deputy, influenced by the opposition's 
accusations of nepotism and quagmire, no longer dares "deal with 
people's problems." But should the deputy really contend 
himself with referring the businessman to the relevant 
authorities or to the legal opportunities available so that "no 
affair can come of it?" Stoiber: "He will say -- why did I vote 
for you?" 
  The adopting of a manifesto on Europe that describes the 
CSU's well-known position was almost routine. European Deputy 
Friedrich described his party colleagues as "realists" that are 
different from both the "skeptics" and the "euphorics." The CSU 
showed skepticism in its own way: The "stability criteria" of 
the Maastricht Treaty must be "strictly" observed, and in the 
process of unification, "stability comes before speed." The CSU 
rejects the idea of a European federal state and welcomes the 
membership of East European countries in the alliance of states. 
The only debate took place when a delegate wanted to have the 
demand for a European social union included in the manifesto. 
His request was not met, with the delegates probably being most 
impressed with Stoiber's argument that "social benefits in 
Portugal" must not be paid for with German money.

<F P=106> ["al." report: "No New Confidence for SPD, CDU, and FDP </F>
From Results of Schleswig-Holstein Elections"] 
  [Excerpts] Kiel, 21 Mar -- The Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD], the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] suffered clear losses in 
votes at the local elections in Schleswig-Holstein. The 
Alliance 90/Greens, the many voters' associations, and the 
Southern Schleswig Voters' Association (SSW) increased their 
shares of the vote, in part considerably. Nevertheless, the SPD 
managed to remain the strongest party in the towns and districts 
of the land. The CDU had its worst local election result in 
this land since the first elections in 1946. The FDP, which 
became the third strongest party at the local elections in 1990, 
is no longer represented in 10 of the 15 district councils or in 
the town halls of the four towns that do not belong to a kreis 
[district]. The Alliance 90/Greens is now represented in all 
the district councils and in the city parliaments of Flensburg, 
Kiel, Luebeck, and Neumuenster. 
  SPD Federal Manager Verheugen said that the result achieved 
by the SPD is "within the scope of what was expected." The 
elections were primarily characterized by aspects of local 
policy. In terms of federal policy, it is to be noted that the 
Bonn coalition parties have once again lost votes, while the SPD 
has remained the strongest party, Verheugen said. 
  CDU Secretary General Hintze called the CDU's results in 
Schleswig-Holstein "unsatisfactory." However, it is gratifying 
that it was possible to narrow the distance between the SPD and 
the CDU from more than 12 percent at the 1992 Landtag election 
to about 1 percent at this local election. The SPD's "drawer 
affair" in Kiel [involving the alleged bribery of a CDU official 
by the SPD] has caused lasting damage to the party's credibility. 
  FDP Chairman Kinkel called the result achieved by his party 
"unpleasant"; however, it should not be overestimated. He is 
certain that the FDP will manage to get out of the "negative 
trend." At the moment, the FDP has difficulties because 
everything that does not work in Germany is blamed on those 
ruling in Bonn "and we have to take the blame for some problems." 
  Mr. Volmer, a spokesman for the Alliance 90/Greens, said 
that 
the parties of the "informal grand coalition in the Federal 
Government" have suffered a "sound defeat," because many people 
demand a "fundamental reform policy instead of crisis management 
along outdated lines." [passage omitted] 
  Schleswig-Holstein Minister-President Simonis (SPD) believes 
that her party's losses are primarily due to SPD mistakes in 
local policy in some regions and not to the land policy. She 
does not believe that the drawer affair in Kiel had any 
influence on her party's election results. 
  Mr. Boernsen, chairman of the SPD group in the Landtag, said 
that all the democratic parties could now improve their 
reputation among the voters in the north, if the drawer affair 
were brought to a conclusion in the Landtag as quickly as 
possible. This gave rise to harsh protests among the CDU, the 
FDP, and the Greens. The SPD should put the truth of the affair 
on the table, and then the drawer could be closed, it was said. 
  CDU Land Chairman Hennig said that the CDU had achieved 
"relatively good results" compared with the trend at federal 
level. 
  FDP Land Chairman Koppelin spoke of a "serious defeat" for 
his party. However, it is not only the policy of the FDP that 
is to be blamed for that. An opinion poll, which was published 
during the week before the elections and predicted 3 percent of 
the vote for the FDP, hurt the party. Nevertheless, he is 
convinced that the bourgeois camp as a whole has not shrunk. 
Koppelin said that the liberals must just make their position 
in this camp clearer and also say "where the trip goes to" at 
the federal level. 
  Mr. Gaertner, land manager of the Alliance 90/Greens, 
interpreted the local election result primarily as a signal for 
Bonn. The course has been set toward a red-green [SPD-Greens] 
coalition; the Greens have finally put aside their image as "the 
eternal losers of elections and fundamentalists."

<F P=106> [Interview with CDU/CSU Bundestag Group Chairman Wolfgang </F>
Schaeuble by Alfred Merta and F. Weckbach-Mara; place and date 
not given: "German Blue Helmets To Sarajevo?"] 
  [Text] [BILD AM SONNTAG] What are the topics with which 
you want to get the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian 
Social Union [CSU] out of its low in the election year? 
  [Schaeuble] The economic situation is improving. We are 
just starting to bring about a change in the labor market. The 
new laws and measures improve opportunities for people looking 
for jobs, especially by means of creating more part-time jobs. 
The effort to provide jobs for everybody is our foremost aim. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] The Social Democratic Party's [SPD] 
objectives sound very similar; are there any differences left? 
  [Schaeuble] Mr. Scharping has made his party look as though 
it is in agreement by sweeping all controversial issues under 
the carpet and avoiding clear standpoints. This can be seen 
from his election program. He announces higher taxes, at the 
same time saying that tax increases are very bad for economic 
recovery. We will force Scharping to put his cards on the table 
in many respects. For instance: Does the SPD want to go on 
ruining the car industry and pushing individual transport aside 
because it does not want to build any new roads but enforce new 
bans instead? And the crucial question whether he is prepared 
to enter into an alliance with the Greens is also something that 
Scharping will not be able to avoid until polling day. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Can you promise that the CDU/CSU is not 
planning any new tax increases? 
  [Schaeuble] The introduction of the solidarity tax on 1 
January 1995 has been decided upon, and we will not reverse this 
decision. But we will do everything we can to make do without 
any further tax increases. In the long run, we must be aiming 
at lowering the taxation level, that is, everything the state 
expects of its citizens in terms of taxes, from the current 52 
to 45 percent. This means, taxes must be lowered in the long 
run. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] How do you want to settle the billions in 
debts of the Federal Railroad, and how do you want to build 
additional roads? 
  [Schaeuble] In building roads we will have to count on 
private funding. This will mean introducing charges for the use 
of certain railroad lines. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Before the summer recess, the Federal 
Constitutional Court will announce its decision on Bundeswehr 
missions abroad. What consequences will this have? 
  [Schaeuble] We will act politically on that decision. The 
CDU/CSU is convinced that peace in Europe and in the world can 
only be preserved by international solidarity in peacekeeping 
missions. But these cannot take place if the Germans refuse to 
participate. This is why we have to take part in missions abroad 
assuming equal rights and duties. I am convinced that the 
Federal Constitutional Court will confirm our view. Of course, 
we will have to decide carefully on a case by case basis whether 
and in what way we want to participate. But in principle, I do 
not rule out anything. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Not even a German blue-helmet 
participation in reconstructing Bosnia, if the parties concerned 
want it? 
  [Schaeuble] If all the parties concerned want such a 
Bundeswehr mission in Bosnia, we, in agreement with our partners 
in Europe and the alliance, should not basically ignore these 
wishes. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] You yourself have demanded that our 
Bundeswehr should also be used for tasks in Germany. Do you 
still hold this view? 
  [Schaeuble] The Bundeswehr is not a reserve police force. 
But if situations occur where the police do not have sufficient 
staffing and equipment and where the Bundeswehr could help, we 
should discuss how this could be done. This is what has been 
happening for a long time in all other countries -- from Austria 
to new Zealand, from America to Holland. 
  [BILD AM SONNTAG] Brandenburg Minister-President Stolpe has 
named a witness for the defense. Does this resolve the dispute? 
  [Schaeuble] No, certainly not. Stolpe's example shows quite 
clearly: Political standards in Germany are no longer right. 
If Mr. Stolpe were a member of the CDU, he would have lost his 
office of minister-president long ago. The same goes for Oskar 
Lafontaine in the Saarland and Hans Eichel in Hesse, or Klaus 
Wedemeier in Bremen. The worst affairs remain without 
consequences in the SPD. The Stolpe case is no longer a matter 
that just concerns the land organization, it has become a case 
for the SPD leadership. I call on Mr. Scharping to make sure 
that all the cards are finally put on the table in Brandenburg. 
Scharping has to force Stolpe to tell the truth and take the 
consequences. Otherwise he is damaging democracy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bundeswehr Inspector General Klaus Naumann </F>
by Adelbert Reif; place and date not given: "Army of Skeptics"] 
  [Text] [Reif] According to the Bundestag's defense 
commissioner, the Bundeswehr is in a desolate state. 
  [Naumann] First of all, the recent defense commissioner's 
report is, as he has himself repeatedly emphasized, a report 
that shows up deficiencies rather than a report on the state of 
the Bundeswehr. If you asked any number of commanders of all 
sections of the armed forces whether what the report of the 
defense commissioner describes reflects the general state of the 
Bundeswehr, then -- I dare predict -- they would all clearly 
answer with no. The reportage on the report, but not the report 
itself, has drawn up a picture that does not reflect the reality 
of the armed forces and does not do justice to the efforts of 
most soldiers who do a respectable job with a great sense of 
responsibility albeit -- admittedly -- under difficult 
conditions. By and large, the picture of the forces is more 
differentiated than could be presented by a compilation of 
deficiencies that are certainly indisputable. 
  [Reif] So it is all a misunderstanding? 
  [Naumann] We have to be grateful for the defense 
commissioner's report to put the finger into a wound that has 
been hurting us for a long time: It shows up the incongruity of 
insufficient funds and a permanently widening range of tasks 
with which we have to struggle. In the parliamentary debates on 
the 1994 defense budget we warned of the danger of sustained 
problems if we received insufficient funds for training, 
exercises, and the use of ammunition. Therefore, the Bundestag 
Budget Committee arrived at the conclusion that no further cuts 
are tolerable at the level of the Bundeswehr. That our budget 
was, nevertheless, cut by another 1.25 billion German marks will 
make it even more difficult in 1994 to provide challenging 
training conditions. 
  [Reif] Are you trying to say that the Bundeswehr's 
assignment will be challenged by the dramatic cuts? 
  [Naumann] The whole range of assignments cannot be met on 
the basis of the funds that we have been allocated. If one 
wants a Bundeswehr with a peace strength of 370,000 men and 
which has more than 150,000 civilian employees, that achieves a 
limited operational capability with all sectors of the armed 
forces, has modern equipment, and is stationed in a way that 
maintains our alliance capability and covers our entire federal 
territory, then it will be inevitable to increase the funds for 
the Bundeswehr. If, however, in view of our country's current 
financial situation it turns out to be impossible to implement 
such an increase, then the politicians must permit us to judge 
which of the above-mentioned parameters have to be regarded as 
being of secondary importance against the background of the 
Bundeswehr's assignment. 
  [Reif] The defense commissioner has described the Bundeswehr 
as consisting of men all of whom are skeptical of themselves. 
  [Naumann] In my opinion it would be wrong to say that all 
Bundeswehr members are skeptical of themselves. The Bundeswehr 
is familiar with its assignment, and it has shown it, whether in 
Somalia, in Cambodia, in the Adriatic, or elsewhere. There can 
be no doubt that some soldiers have doubts about themselves. We 
must not forget that for 35 years the Bundeswehr had a clearly 
defined -- I would say one-dimensional -- assignment, namely the 
defense of our country in border-near forward defense along with 
our allies. This assignment was deeply anchored in the 
awareness of our officers and noncommissioned officers, and we 
were profoundly prepared for it. Regardless of the level of 
command and control, everybody knew how successful defense had 
to be carried out. Our way of thinking was determined by 
defense planning that was consistent with the critical security 
realities of the FRG. Today we no longer have such simple 
quantities for orientation. 
  [Reif] There are plans for joint maneuvers by Germans, 
French, and Poles still this year. German soldiers should even 
participate in joint exercises in Poland. Is the time ripe for 
it yet? 
  [Naumann] I am of the view that we have the chance to 
continue the process of reconciliation with Poland more 
intensively. After all, German-Polish history must not be 
reduced to the 12 gloomy years in German history. It is more, 
because the chain of conflicts between Germans and Poles dates 
back to the early Dark Ages. If both peoples, who now live 
within safe and mutually recognized borders, have the 
opportunity to create a peaceful future together, then they have 
to make use of this opportunity. The soldiers of both nations 
should play a significant role in it. If, for example through 
joint exercises, we indicate that we want to protect peace 
together, then this can help to promote the process of 
reconciliation through getting to know one another. 
  We will probably very soon enter into close relations of 
partnership, and maybe even sponsorship with other, immediate 
neighbors, such as the Czechs, but also with our neutral 
neighbors, should they so wish. Only a few days ago we 
discussed with the Russian defense minister the possibility of 
German soldiers holding an exercise on Russian soil in 1995 and, 
in return, Russian soldiers participating in joint exercises in 
Germany in 1996. One objective of such exercises is the 
preparation of joint missions within the framework of the United 
Nations.

<F P=106> [Report by Ute Emig: "DM175 Billion for the East"] </F>
  [Text] Minister in the Chancellor's Office Friedrich Bohl 
on Tuesday [15 March] in Berlin drew up a positive balance sheet 
of the Federal Government's reconstruction work in the new 
laender. "Not always, but more and more often" he can see 
"flourishing landscapes" there. The harmonization of the living 
conditions in east and west is making good progress. Economic 
growth in the former GDR increased by 7 percent last year, and a 
similarly high increase is expected for 1994, while in the old 
laender only 1 percent is expected. 
  These favorable developments were primarily achieved by the 
people in the five eastern laender, Bohl said. Under completely 
new conditions, they have made decisive achievements. The 
atmosphere in talks with individual people is even often better 
than the assessment of the situation in general. 
  Bohl described the many and various measures taken by the 
Federal Government that have promoted this process in the past 
few years: 

  -  The financial transfer to the new laender 
amounted to some 177 billion German marks [DM] (gross), while 
1994 plans involve DM175 billion in gross transfer payments. 
  -  For 
the transport investment in the new laender DM13.8 billion were 
provided in 1992 and DM13.2 billion in 1993. For the further 
extension of federal highways DM4.2 billion will be spent this 
year alone. Until the year 2002 the Federal Government will 
invest some DM33 billion into the former German Reichsbahn 
railroads. 
  -  A total of 2.2 million new telephone lines have been 
installed since reunification, and 95 percent of all households 
should be connected by 1997. The investment volume of Telekom 
for this modernization amounts to DM60 billion, which makes it 
the third largest individual investor and secures more than 
90,000 jobs in the new laender. 
  -  Every other new business that 
was set up in the new laender was promoted with public funds. 
Some 213,500 credits for the establishment of new businesses 
have been granted since 1990 involving a total investment sum of 
DM86 billion. Some 450,000 businesses now employ 3 million 
employees. 
  The chancellory minister also sees a significant upswing in 
the sphere of housing construction. While in the first half 
year of 1993 some 27,500 apartments were licensed, it was as 
many as 47,500 in the second six-month period. The development 
of pensions was also positive. The monthly pension payments at 
the end of the GDR era were 450 marks, while now the average is 
DM1,406, or some 75 percent of Western levels.

<F P=106> ["agr"-signed report: "DIW: Recessionary Pressures Have </F>
the Upper Hand"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- In its latest weekly report, the 
Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), 
writes that prospects for an improvement in consumer spending 
are extremely slight. 
  The indications are that recessionary pressures still have 
the upper hand and that the forecasts of disposable incomes 
remaining static in the first half of 1994 were too optimistic. 
As the rate at which prices have been growing is only 
slackening slowly, it must now be assumed that private 
households will see real incomes fall by a good 3 percent. 
Thus, anything other than a further tangible drop in real 
consumption would be a surprise. 
  The DIW ascribes these trends to continued negative 
developments on the labor market and the continued shedding of 
jobs in manufacturing. The provisions of 1994 collective 
agreements too -- incomes are expected to rise by about 2 
percent -- are not expected to stimulate consumption. In 
addition, state austerity measures and increases in public dues 
will also have a dampening effect. 
  The poor consumer spending climate is in keeping with 
overall 
economic indicators. The consumption barometer has fallen once 
again. Private households expect their financial situation to 
deteriorate further over the next few months. In addition, 
there is less of a readiness to use savings now. 
  The prospects for eastern Germany are rather better. The DIW 
believes that if prices grow at the projected rate of 4 percent, 
an improvement in real incomes is probable. This would create a 
favorable situation for an increase in consumer demand. 
  In western Germany, private consumption fell by 1 percent in 
the fourth quarter of 1993. The poor economic climate has 
resulted in a decline in savings ratios. The current savings 
ratio is 2 percent below the highest level of the fall of 1990 
and is only within half a percent of the lowest level of the 
recession at the beginning of the 1980's. 
  In view of the significant increase in administrative 
prices, 
the recession has only had a gradual impact on price growth. 
The cost of living rose by an average of 4 percent in 1993. 
The loss in real incomes amounted to about 1 percent last year. 
Retail trading was particularly affected, with sales falling 4 
percent in real terms. 
  While expenditure on services, repair work, and rents was 
unaffected by the economic climate, in the fourth quarter of 
1993, there was a 3.5-percent fall in west German demand for 
consumer durables, especially automobiles, followed by consumer 
electronics. 
  In eastern Germany, disposable income rose by an average of 
7 
percent during 1993 and has thus slowed markedly. Thus, the 
reduced scope for increasing spending was partially offset by 
cutting back on savings. The savings ratio fell by half a 
percentage point between the third and fourth quarters of 1993. 
  Altogether, private consumption in eastern Germany fell by 
0.5 percent in real terms. This was primarily due to a drastic 
decline in demand for automobiles. As in 1992, the cost of 
living rose by 9 percent, and this was mainly due to the sharp 
increase in rents at the beginning of 1993.

  [Text] Munich -- The Bavarian land government is going to 
resign from the steel industry and the aviation and space 
industry. The land will sell its stakes in the "Neue Maxhuette" 
and the "Lechstahl" enterprise to Max Aicher, a construction and 
steel industrialist of Freilassing. This Cabinet decision was 
announced by Minister President Edmund Stoiber, of the Christian 
Social Union, in Munich on Tuesday [15 March]. "The future of 
the Maxhuette is thus safe," Stoiber said. The looming 
bankruptcy has been avoided, and Sulzbach-Rosenberg will be 
preserved as a steel center and a significant part of jobs in 
Maxhuette will also be saved. However, to attain this 
objective, Bavaria must provide another 140 million German 
marks. Stoiber also announced that in the coming week, the 
Bavarian Government will resign from the German Aviation and 
Space enterprise Dasa.

<F P=106> ["kv"-signed report: "Engineering: No Rapid Upturn"] </F>
  [Text] Following the deep recession of the past three 
years, the German engineering industry is not counting on a 
sustained upturn until 1995/96. The "bottom turning point" has 
been reached or perhaps already crossed, but 1994 will remain a 
"transitional year" in which output and sales will only grow by 
2 percent in real terms. 
  "Domestic business, the investment climate in Germany still 
remains the Achilles heel," said Jan Kleinewefers, president of 
the Association of German Machine-Building Enterprises (VDMA), 
speaking to the press in Frankfurt. One only expects negative 
trends in Germany to end in the second half of the year. Thus, 
domestic orders might increase by between 2 and 3 percent for 
the year as a whole, whereas foreign orders are to rise by about 
10 percent. 
  The expected increase in output and sales will come solely 
from abroad. In the case of exports, the VDMA expects a rise of 
4 percent while domestic sales are expected to stagnate. The 
VDMA president bases his confidence in the worst already being 
behind us in the latest trends: Over the past few weeks, 
reports on trends from abroad have indicated a sustained 
improvement and negative trends in Germany have been declining 
slowly, but clearly. 
  Engineering has suffered "from the erosion of its customers 
profits more than any other branch of industry." A net yield on 
manufacturing sales of currently less than 1 percent is not 
sufficient to stimulate investment, create new jobs, modernize 
the economy, and bolster the economy's competitiveness. In 
engineering, another 100,000 jobs will be lost in 1994, of which 
about 50,000 will be in western Germany. Since 1990, the number 
of employees in the old laender has declined by 250,000. 
  Kleinewefers said he was pleased that with demand growing, 
German engineering industry products were still very much in 
demand internationally. Overseas export orders have been rising 
again for almost a year, but over the past few months "a shift 
in a positive direction" has also occurred in some West European 
countries. 
  In 1993, output fell by 11 percent and sales by 9 percent 
(11 
in real terms) to 209 (230) billion German marks [DM]. Thus, 
over the course of the three-year recession, this branch of 
industry has lost almost 20 percent of its production volume. 
Orders fell by 8 percent in real terms (domestic orders fell by 
15 percent and foreign orders rose by 1 percent). Exports fell 
by 5 percent to DM110 (116) billion. With imports totalling 
DM59 (71) billion (a decline of 13 percent), the balance of 
trade surplus amounts to DM51 (45) billion, which is 
significantly higher than the total German balance of trade 
surplus of DM34 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Kessler, Birgit Marschall, and Lorenz </F>
Wolf-Doettinchem: "Cold Shoulder; Leisurely Banks, Restrictive 
Regulations, Fearful Investors"] 
  [Text] In the beginning, Aachen Parsytec Computer GmbH was 
left to its own devices. The financial subsidies from Bonn that 
had been applied for and approved arrived much too late for its 
startup. Not until the 800,000 German marks [DM] finally arrived 
were the company founders able to decisively increase the tempo 
of expansion, according to Friedrich Luecking, Parsytec's 
marketing chief. Today, the manufacturer of parallel computers 
has 150 employees and--only eight years after startup--sales of 
nearly DM30 million. Sales specialist Luecking is certain that 
without government money "we would not have achieved such rapid 
growth." Other financiers--such as the big banks--kept aloof. At 
the time, only the Aachen City Savings Bank granted the founders 
of the enterprise a loan. 
  The experience of the Aachen electronics tinkerers is not an 
exception. Whoever has ideas but no capital and wants to 
establish a company in Germany has a rough time of it. Private 
financiers are a scarce commodity, banks insist on collateral, 
and government grants are to be landed--if at all--only after 
nerve-deadening struggles with forms and long waiting periods. 
It is understandable that Erich Haeusser, head of the German 
Patent Office, laments: "No one in Germany really risks capital 
for innovations." If, in the management suites of industry and 
the banks, the people with reservations continue to maintain the 
upper hand, according to the top guardian of patents, "German 
business and industry will be throwing jobs away." 
  To date, it has been primarily too costly workers, sleepy 
managers, and regulation-crazy politicians that have been held 
responsible for Germany's malaise as a location for business and 
industry. On the other hand, it was not only Mannheim economics 
professor Wolfgang Buehler who consistently included the banking 
system among the "assets" of Germany as a place to do business. 
No wonder: The German financial houses have remained spared of 
crises such as the savings and loan scandal in the United States 
or the real estate debacle in Japan. Even during the deepest 
recession the major banks in Frankfurt have achieved record 
profits--proof for Manfred Weber, general executive manager of 
the National Association of German Banks, of the "stabilizing 
effect" of the universal banking system. Because German credit 
institutions are permitted to engage in all types of financial 
business and are allowed to accumulate undisclosed reserves 
almost at will, they can consistently show profits. 
  But Ingo Walter, a professor at New York University and at 
INSEAD [European Business Management Institute] in Fontainbleau, 
believes that it is often the case that "success is a sign of 
failure" because "great stability" has a reverse side to it--"a 
lack of growth." The cost to the German economy, according to 
bank expert Walter: "too high capital costs" and "too little 
receptivity to innovation." The close relationship between 
credit management and industry--resulting from links to house 
banks, equity interests, and directorships--that once made the 
economic miracle possible, is now increasingly acting as a brake 
on growth. Dieter Wolf, head of the Cartel Office, also lamented 
during the latest hearings before the Economics Committee of the 
Bundestag on the subject of "the power of the banks" that the 
strong influence of the banks "has a tendency" to act in a way 
that is "inimical to innovation." 
  Germany's managers have thus far not been heard uttering 
such 
sharp criticism--no one would like to ruin things with his house 
bank during a recession. Yet when the Munich IFO Institute 
[Institute for Economic Research] was commissioned by 
WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE to sound out 702 companies, the managers, under 
the protection of anonymity, dispensed with their reserve: Some 
59 percent complain about too little competition among German 
banks and 63 percent regard their willingness to undertake risk 
to be too low when compared to international standards. 
  New York expert Walters believes that, in contrast to the 
Americans, the British, and even the French, the Germans have 
apparently not grasped the "principle of diversification"--harsh 
criticism since, after all, every economics student today learns 
portfolio theory that teaches that a combination of speculative 
investments can entail lower overall risk than the respective 
individual risks. Yet the Germans, bank researcher Walter 
observes, are still always looking at things on 
project-by-project basis rather than looking at entire 
portfolios. The unfortunate consequences: There is too little 
risk capital for innovation and establishing new companies. 
  For all that, it looked in the 1980's as if the banks were 
awakening from their lethargy. Under the sponsorship of 
financially strong institutes, holding companies were springing 
up everywhere. The successes in California's Silicon Valley 
invited imitation: The average return on capital of American 
venture capital companies reached 20 percent. The Germans tasted 
blood and from 1982 through 1987 the volume of investments grew 
from DM785 million to just under DM1.6 billion. When quick 
success was not forthcoming, things went downhill again. Instead 
of investing in risky, innovative projects, the holding 
companies preferred to buy into established medium to 
small-sized companies. Holger Frommann, managing director of the 
National Association of German Financial Investment Companies, 
does not like to use the terms "venture capital" or "risk 
capital" any more because of their "negative sound." True 
venture financing, according to Hans-Joachim Hass, chief of the 
Economic Policy Department at the BDI [Federal Association of 
German Industry], "hardly exists any more." 
  The extreme aversion to risk on the part of German banks has 
proven to be particularly unfortunate for reconstruction in 
eastern Germany. It helps little that Federal Chancellor Kohl 
repeatedly makes a personal appeal for the promised "bank 
billions." Bad consequences of the lack of risk capital: Most 
east German inventors and companies are facing the threat of 
losing their patent rights. Only 18 percent of former GDR 
patents had acquired full legal patent protection by the end of 
1992; the Patent Office estimates that about 50 percent of them 
are usable, however, yet the money is only sufficient for the 
registration of individual inventions. Consequence: For 
companies, the innovative potential is lost. 
  Whether in the east or the west--there is enough money, 
complains Klaus Bregger, chairman of the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Association of Small 
Businessmen, but it is just "being put in the wrong place." The 
big banks have given "the cold shoulder" often enough to the 
founders of software companies and biolabs: "The banks are 
lacking in expertise and intuition." 
  The conservative predominance of the established money 
houses 
has created a climate that leaves little room for venture 
capital. For the minority of risk-loving investors in Germany 
there are few opportunities to invest in expanding companies 
because young firms are a scarce commodity on the stock 
market--underwriting is handled almost exclusively by the banks 
and their creditworthiness requirements are far more stringent 
than the legal regulations. Whereas more than 800 firms were 
launched on Wall Street last year, precisely nine new companies 
made it to the stock market in Germany. 
  Whether the Bonn government's plans for the registration of 
a 
"small joint stock company" can make a decisive difference 
remains yet to be seen. No doubt about it: The German equity 
market is underdeveloped and, in addition to restrictive 
regulations and fearful investors, it is the leisurely banks 
that are primarily responsible for it. Moreover, for a long time 
foreign investors were not enthusiastic about Siemens, 
Daimler-Benz, or Mannesmann stock because, in contrast to the 
Anglo-Saxon world, the financial markets hardly play a role in 
the control of companies in Germany. 
  Unimpressed by short-term capers, members of the board of 
directors from banks and friendly companies saw to the 
reconciliation of interests among workers, managers, and 
shareholders. Yet what for a long time had been a "mainstay," 
the British magazine ECONOMIST groused, is now developing into a 
"burden" because the conflicts of interest are becoming 
critical--the conflict between the desire of employees for 
lifelong employment and that of shareholders for better return 
on capital, for example. 
  According to American professor Walter, the scandal 
surrounding the metal company [as published] causes doubts about 
the German system to continue to grow. The very thing happened 
in that case that bank participation on boards of directors was 
supposed to prevent: "The theory was good but the practice of it 
was not very successful." The New York economist hopes that the 
affair of the metal company could--certainly in a way similar to 
that of the insider scandal involving IG Metall [Industrial 
Trade Union of Metalworkers] boss Franz Steinkuehler--initiate 
reforms in the German system. The Federal Government's second 
Capital Market Development Law, after all, provides for stricter 
regulations concerning insiders and the establishment of an 
independent regulatory authority for securities. Werner Seifert, 
head of Deutsche Boersen AG [German Stock Exchanges, Inc.], is 
citing the emergence of an "equity culture" in Germany. But 
banking official Weber warns against "exaggerated expectations:" 
"We have a long road ahead of us." 
  Innovative company founders can hardly muster that much 
patience and the call for state intervention is thus rapidly 
becoming louder among Bonn economic policy makers: The CDU wants 
to create tax breaks for high-tech investors, and Jenoptik chief 
Lothar Spaeth wants to entice private investors, banks, and the 
government to join together in a collective innovation fund--a 
proposal that makes Minister for Economics Guenter Rexrodt 
shudder. He is not at all in favor of the government "jumping 
into"--of all places--that most noble discipline of the free 
market economy: the allocation of risk capital. 
  The Aachen Parsytec Company has already drawn its 
conclusions 
from the stunted venture capital market in Germany: It wishes to 
sell shares on the stock market--not in Frankfurt or 
Duesseldorf, however, but rather directly to risk-loving 
investors--in the United States.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Michael Hill: "Temporary Compromise"] </F>
  [Text] He will not "drink to it until everything down to 
the smallest detail has been settled," Transport Minister 
Matthias Wissmann said on the agreement achieved in the 
German-U.S. aviation dispute on Friday [18 March]. Yet -- 
putting it simply -- everything will remain much the same for 
the U.S. side; the capacity reduction in U.S. flights to Germany 
and beyond Germany, which were the starting point of talks about 
a new German-U.S. aviation agreement last year, will not take 
place. The German side has achieved that Lufthansa will be able 
to start the much-discussed code-sharing with its partner United 
Airlines as of 1 May. In addition, the airlines of the two 
countries, together with other partners, may offer flights going 
from Germany to the East, and from the United States to Latin 
America and the Caribbean, under their own flight numbers. Yet, 
the latest agreement will only remain a temporary arrangement. 
  On 15 May, representatives of the two countries are to meet 
to discuss the medium-term enforcement of an "open sky" -- the 
complete liberalization of aviation between the United States 
and Germany. In four years, at the latest, the agreement being 
concluded now will be replaced by a more comprehensive 
"bilateral or multinational settlement." One can expect the 
Brussels Commission's plans to replace existing bilateral 
aviation agreements between individual European Union [EU] 
members by EU agreements negotiated in Brussels to have been 
effected by then. 
  Now -- for the next four years -- Lufthansa can offer an 
increasing number of flights to destinations that have so far 
not been included in its program, with through flight numbers, 
changing between Lufthansa and United planes. 
  But this code-sharing must remain a makeshift solution. If 
the problem of neutral presentation, especially in the U.S. 
travel agency reservation systems, did not exist, the advantages 
in which this term leads the customer to believe could also have 
been achieved by a cooperation agreement among individual 
airlines: Good connections, through check-in, joint programs 
for frequent travelers, other joint services, such as the use of 
lounges, are not subject to code-sharing. 
  European and U.S. consumer protection organizations, as well 
as Brussels, are beginning to realize that a joint flight 
number, where you have to change planes once or twice and change 
airlines, makes the traveler believe that he gets to his 
destination "in one go." Alliances, such as the one Swissair has 
formed with Delta Airlines going west, and with Singapore 
Airlines going to Asia, are more honest to the user. 
  Now the German-U.S. aviation problem has -- hopefully -- 
been 
settled for the next four years. Lufthansa must use this time 
to continue getting its own house in order so that it can do 
without protective fences against non-EU countries, as is 
already the case with EU airlines. By the end of this decade, 
aviation must do without any protective fences by the state and 
must only be subject to GATT competition regulations.

<F P=106> [Fritz Werth commentary: "Clinton in Trouble"] </F>
  [Text] The walls of denials and affirmations of innocence 
with which Bill Clinton has tried to separate himself from the 
Whitewater affair for months, are getting increasingly porous 
day by day. The scandal is no longer a personal and private 
problem. It is beginning to paralyze the work and effectiveness 
of the President. The latest decision by the Senate to 
investigate the affair itself guarantees that Whitewater will be 
playing several stages in the future and will thus become a 
public spectacle. So far, the investigations have been in the 
discreet hands of a special investigator who worked behind the 
scenes. 
  The consequences of the fact that this affair is becoming a 
crisis marathon: It paralyzes not only the President's political 
effectiveness, it has now also deteriorated to the mud-slinging 
spheres of a bitter quarrel between the parties, because this is 
an election year in the United States. Congressmen are 
struggling for their political survival. The congressional 
investigation decided by the Senate yesterday thus unavoidably 
moves into the sphere of uncontrolled political blows below the 
belt. 
  What makes this development so painful is the fact that it 
is 
largely the fault of the Clintons themselves. Their often 
incomprehensible crisis-containment policy threatens to 
collapse, because for someone who does not have anything to 
hide, as the Clintons have repeatedly insisted for months, they 
have desperately built many defensive walls around them. In the 
past they vehemently opposed the appointment of a special 
investigator, and then had to give in. And, until yesterday, 
they struggled with equal vehemence against an investigation by 
Congress. 
  The "back flip" has become a familiar piece of crisis 
gymnastics by Bill Clinton. His toppling over, his retreats, 
and his contradictions in this conflict prove what became 
obvious also in far more urgent and more important crises, such 
as Bosnia, Haiti, Somalia, and China: This is a president who 
is ill-advised.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Eberhard Wisdorff: "Playing Tough"] </F>
  [Text] The cheering was rather restrained when the foreign 
ministers of the European Union [EU] last week came to an 
agreement on the conditions for EU membership with Norway and 
thus paved the way to the European Union for the fourth 
candidate after Sweden, Austria, and Finland. The moderate 
satisfaction with the expansion, however, covered up a distrust 
between the 12, which has now erupted in several instances. 
  It may be that, with another attempt this Tuesday [22 
March], 
the foreign ministers will be able to settle the controversy 
with Great Britain and Spain regarding the blocking minority for 
votes in the Council. This would not change the fact that, 
above all, the British position was aimed at paralyzing the 
decisionmaking procedures in the expanded European Union and is 
thus once again an expression of continuing hostility toward 
integration. It may also be that the acting Council president, 
Greek European Affairs Minister Pangalos, primarily thought of 
his country's own interests when he called the planned expansion 
precipitate. In any case, the quarrel over the voting 
procedures has proved those right -- including the Brussels 
Commission in the past -- who wanted to link this necessary step 
with a further reform of the EU institutions. 
  The relationship between the size of the European Union and 
its politically, urgently necessary ability to act remains 
unclear with a view to the future. Because of unclear motives, 
London wants expansion at all cost, while, at the same time, 
weakening the European Union. Paris is still looking for 
composure in view of German unification and the shifting of the 
European balance toward the northeast, which goes hand in hand 
with expansion and subsequent accessions. In Bonn, the next 
expansion of the European Union to Central and East Europe is 
being pursued, at least verbally, with every ounce of strength. 
At the same time, however, there are more or less open demands 
on the partners to ease the burden on Germany as a net payer, 
but without any idea who is supposed to pay for the costs of a 
speedy expansion toward the east, which are threatening in the 
long run. 
  In this difficult situation and in view of understandable 
sensitivity on the French side, German foreign policy headed by 
Klaus Kinkel does not have any better idea than to play it tough 
at the European level. No matter which statements were really 
made in detail and led to the diplomatic conflict in Bonn last 
week: Observers of the negotiations in Brussels have long felt 
this tone, which expresses self-confidence not through calmness, 
mastery, and sensitivity but through obvious loudness. 
  The expansion of the European Union makes the considerations 
about its ability to function, which have been postponed until 
1996 by the Maastricht Treaty, all the more urgent. In 
particular, because political coincidence has shifted the 
weights in the European Union, intensive cooperation between 
Germany and France is playing an even greater role. One should 
not carelessly gamble away the existing capital.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Wolfram Engels: "Negative Tax"] </F>
  [Text] A similar development has been apparent in all 
industrial countries since about 1970: The demand for poorly 
qualified labor is declining. The elimination of unskilled labor 
has two causes: rationalization and competition from low-wage 
countries. The more unskilled the work is, the more easily it 
can be performed by machines. Automation of factories has 
eliminated the requirement for a large portion of the unskilled 
workers who were formerly needed. When it comes to simple and 
labor-intensive products, industry in the developed world is no 
longer competitive: They are being imported from low-wage 
countries. These trends can be easily projected into the future. 
With the improvement and reduction in cost of data processing 
technology, rationalization will continue and increasingly take 
hold in the service sector. The displacement of production to 
low-wage countries will increase in tempo and threaten even jobs 
requiring higher qualifications. 
  There are two responses to this challenge. In America, the 
result was an ever greater wage spread. Since 1970, the real 
wage for unskilled labor has declined by about a quarter while 
it has increased for skilled work. The unskilled workers let go 
by industry have, for the most part, found jobs in the service 
sector: In America windshields are still cleaned at gas stations 
and purchases are still bagged in grocery stores. 
  In Germany on the other hand, as in the other countries of 
Europe as well, an ever growing base of unemployment among the 
unskilled is being formed--a hard core that continues to grow 
even in a period of economic recovery. In contrast to America, 
wage policy sought to reduce wage differences. The lower wage 
groups were assisted with base wage supplements to a greater 
extent than were the upper groups. The incentive was thus 
correspondingly greater in Germany than it was in the United 
States to replace unskilled labor with machines or to eliminate 
it entirely. There are hardly any full-service gas stations here. 
  The parties to collective wage bargaining did not choose 
this 
path entirely voluntarily. There was ever greater overlap 
between incomes in the lower brackets and social welfare 
payments--particularly in the case of families with children. In 
Germany therefore, wage spread such as in America would only 
have resulted in more workers going on welfare and achieving a 
higher income with a little off-the-books work. The results of 
German policy then were simply unemployment for the unskilled 
and ever more welfare recipients. In 1970, only 1.5 million 
people were receiving welfare; today, their number is about 4 
million in the old laender alone. The increase consists almost 
exclusively of persons of working age and their children. 
  That is expensive for society as a whole. The average 
household in the old laender must pay about 1,500 German marks 
[DM] in taxes each year just for welfare. The costs of 
unemployment among the unskilled are not much less. Moreover, 
their social environment produces increasing crime. Yet it is 
not the high costs, but the fate of these people on the 
periphery of society that is the real scandal. 
  If we are not willing to accept the American solution to the 
problem--increasing differences in incomes--and yet, on the 
other hand, the market is not producing high wages for unskilled 
labor, then only a single solution remains: Wages must be left 
up to the market and unsuitable discrepancies must be corrected 
later. The instrument for this is the so-called negative tax. It 
has been advocated in politics for years by the Greens; some 
months ago it cropped up in the campaign platform of the Free 
Democratic Party (FDP), and last week it was adopted into the 
Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) party program. For all that, 
the impetus for latter-day discussions of it comes from Social 
Democracy. The inventor of the negative tax, Lady Rhys-Williams, 
was an active member of the Fabian Society, a leftist 
intellectual British club. Of course, since arch-free-marketeer 
Milton Friedman has been advocating the instrument, it has 
become disreputable in the ranks of the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany (SPD). 
  In its simplest version, the matter looks like this: The tax 
scale is composed of a proportional percentage--30 percent, for 
example--and a fixed amount to be claimed as a deduction 
("standard deduction") of DM8,000, for example. For an income of 
DM60,000, there would then be a tax obligation of DM18,000 minus 
DM8,000, which calculates out to [a total obligation of] 
DM10,000. If the taxpayer earned only DM20,000 annually, the 
same calculation would result in a DM6,000 tax obligation minus 
the DM8,000 standard deduction and therefore a negative DM2,000. 
The taxpayer then does not have to pay tax: He gets back DM2,000 
from the revenue office. 
  The genius of the idea is that today a welfare recipient's 
supplementary income from work is added almost fully to his 
welfare receipts; the implicit marginal tax rate is close to 100 
percent. For that reason, wages below the level of welfare 
payments are not feasible. With the negative tax, however, wages 
can be below it because the worker is still considerably better 
off than with welfare alone. 
  Originally, the negative tax was recommended for a different 
purpose: It was supposed to bring order to our chaotic 
redistribution system--a system in which no one can know any 
more who is paying how much to whom. It seems today that it is 
also the only idea that offers a prospect of success in 
combating unemployment among the unskilled.

  [Text] Lyon, France, March 22 (AFP) -- Thousands of 
students resumed anti-government demonstrations on Tuesday [22 
March] after a day of violence on Monday in which 20 police were 
injured and 57 people arrested in two French cities. 
  In Paris Tuesday, students protesting government plans to 
cut 
the minimum wage for young people climbed on railway tracks and 
held up a train. Students blocked another train at Ferte 
Bernard, western France. 
  A thousand students began demonstrating in this eastern city 
on Tuesday and 1,000 at nearby Saint-Etienne. 
  Another 1,000 blocked a road bridge at Valence, stopping 
traffic. Smaller demonstrations took place at Bourgoin-Jallieu 
and Vienne, and in the Alps, at Chambery and Annemasse. 
  The worst violence occurred Monday night at Nantes, western 
France, when several hundred youths fought for three-and-half 
hours with riot police. 
  The youths, who moved in after a peaceful student 
demonstration, hurled rocks and bottles at police. They 
retaliated with tear gas and charged the attackers. 
  Twenty police were injured, authorities said, one of them 
seriously when a paving stone broke his jaw, and 17 people were 
arrested. 
  The violence broke out after a rally by 4,000 called to 
protest alleged police brutality at an anti-government protest 
last week. The youths set fire to garbage bins, ripping down 
billboard posters and raiding construction sites for wood to 
keep the flames burning. 
  In Lyon 40 young people were arrested after youths and 
police 
swapped stones and bottles for volleys of tear-gas. Forty shop 
fronts were smashed and many cars seriously damaged, authorities 
said. No one was reported hurt. 
  On Tuesday Interior Minister Charles Pasqua warned of the 
risk of "serious incidents," adding "Anything can happen. We 
can't send in the police against children of 13 and 15." 
  In Paris on Monday, trade union leaders held meetings with 
Labour Minister Michel Giraud to discuss details of concessions 
he offered to students last Friday, but they said they were 
still unhappy with the changes. 
  But Giraud went ahead with the plan Tuesday, publishing a 
decree which stated that young people with diplomas or 
university decrees would be paid 80 percent of an ordinary 
salary for 80 percent of working time, with 20 percent of 
training. No qualified youth would be paid less than the 
minimum wage, the decree said. 
  The independent trade union Force Ouvriere called 
publication 
of the decree "a provocation." 
  Initially, the government's scheme proposed that all youths 
be paid 20 percent less than the minimum wage of 5,900 francs 
(1,000 dollars) a month. 
  Hundreds of thousands of students and labor union supporters 
staged protests last week all across France to denounce the 
government plan, designed to fight France's record unemployment. 
A national protest has been called for next Friday. 
  France has 3.3 million unemployed -- almost 12 percent of 
the 
work force -- of whom more than 750,000 are under 25.

  [Text] Paris, March 17 (AFP) -- French General Jean Cot, 
recalled as commander of UN forces in ex-Yugoslavia after 
outspoken calls for NATO airstrikes in Bosnia, was lauded and 
decorated here Thursday [17 March] by Defence Minister Francois 
Leotard. 
  Leotard presented a visibly moved Cot with the Medal for 
Military Valour and praised the general's "pugnacity and 
determination." 
  Cot, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] commander for eight 
months, left office Tuesday -- four months early -- after being 
effectively sacked by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
for surpassing his mandate. 
  The move followed a string of virulent attacks by Cot on UN 
decision-making, including demands late 1993 and early 1994 for 
the right to launch air strikes in Bosnia. 
  Cot also denounced the "humiliations" suffered by UN troops 
prevented by UN rules from properly defending themselves. 
  France over the weekend criticised UN indecision over 
launching reprisals after a series of attacks on French UN 
troops by Bosnian Serb forces in the northwestern Bihac area. 
  Asked Thursday about his future, Cot said he intended to 
"take a month off." 
  Observers noted that at his level -- a five star general -- 
there were few opportunities for advancement in the French Army. 
  If he were to follow the example of General Philippe 
Morillon, the former commander of UN troops in Bosnia, Cot could 
become a government adviser, or could ask for early retirement, 
18 months ahead of the scheduled date.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aerospatiale President Louis Gallois by </F>
Patrick Marx and Francois Roche; place and date not given: 
"Government Aid: Louis Gallois Wants a `Marrakesh Round'" -- 
first paragraph is LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES introduction] 
  [Text] This year, European aviation will enter a crucial 
phase in the face of American competition, especially in the 
manufacture of airliners. Confronted with Boeing and McDonnell 
Douglas, which, by winning a 35-billion-franc [Fr] contract in 
Saudi Arabia, have demonstrated the formidable political and 
diplomatic support they receive from the White House, the 
partners in Airbus Industrie will have to find a suitable 
response. Just like they will have to defend tooth and nail 
what they gained from the agreement of July 1992, which put a 
ceiling on reimbursable advances paid to Airbus and indirect aid 
received by American companies. In this difficult international 
context, the improvement in Aerospatiale's accounts brings a 
note of optimism to its President Louis Gallois. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] In 1993, Aerospatiale managed to 
reduce its losses compared to the previous year by almost half. 
What is your comment on this result. 
  [Gallois] The improvement in the accounts is certainly 
insufficient -- we are still making a substantial loss -- but it 
is significant. This is all the more true since it is taking 
place against the background of a deteriorated economic climate. 
With sales down 4.5 percent, the operating results and the net 
results have improved by almost Fr1 billion. The need for 
operating capital has shrunk considerably, thus making it 
possible to reduce the net debt by Fr3.2 billion before the 
capital appropriation of Fr2 billion. These figures reflect the 
effort made by everyone in the company. They show the company's 
ability to adapt to a difficult period, and that is a highly 
encouraging sign for the future. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] From time to time voices are heard 
calling for a change in the legal structure of the Airbus 
Industrie consortium in order to turn it into a genuine, more 
efficient company. Do you share this concern? 
  [Gallois] I would reiterate that, in the space of 20 years, 
the Airbus consortium has taken 30 percent of the world market 
in airliners with more than 100 seats. Airbus must adapt to the 
growth in its sector of activity and stay competitive when 
confronted with competitors, who are not inactive. To do that, 
it is essential that its industrial partners reduce their costs, 
which should encourage them to improve cooperation. Many things 
can be done in this respect without changing the legal 
structure. If serious obstacles were to arise to the needed 
progress, and if they justified a change in the status of the 
consortium, we would have to look into it, but then we would 
have to be sure that it was worth the trouble, because it would 
be an enormous task. I sometimes get the feeling that I am 
watching an ideological debate. Let us be pragmatic, and open! 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Could the European aviation sector be 
weakened by the Italian Alenia group's plan to take a stake in 
the capital of McDonnell Douglas? 
  [Gallois] That is a good question. We are working closely 
with Alenia, with whom we share the ATR [Regional Transport 
Aircraft] consortium, which accounts for a major share of their 
work load. I have always regretted the fact that Alenia was not 
part of Airbus. However, to get the Italians to enter now would 
require a new program. The future large military transport 
plane, the FLA, which will be the subject of international 
cooperation, could provide the right occasion for bringing the 
Italians closer to European aviation. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] The Saudi contract of mid-February, 
which will entail the purchase by Saudi Airlines of some 50 
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas airliners, caused indignation on 
the part of the Airbus partners, who were excluded from the 
contract because of the highly political campaign waged by the 
United States. How do you analyze this affair? 
  [Gallois] The airplanes were sold a little like how military 
aircraft are sold. There has always been political intervention 
on the occasion of government visits, for example, but within 
certain limits. This time, the announcement of the contract was 
made by President Clinton himself. The White House publicly 
confirmed its role and Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown said that 
he himself negotiated directly with Riyadh. He also affirmed 
that the same thing would happen again in the future. The 
important thing is not to say whether this is good or bad, but 
to learn the lesson. For us in Europe, it means that we have to 
adjust our behavior and set up a device making it possible to 
act the same way as the Americans. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] The GATT member states are meeting 
from 12 to 15 April in Marrakesh to sign the agreements on the 
Uruguay Round. It is known that the aviation issue was not 
handled in the way the Europeans would have liked, because of 
opposition from the United States, and it is still pending... 
  [Gallois] The GATT talks have demonstrated one thing, for 
lack of coming to a close: The Americans want to eliminate the 
reimbursable advances given to the partners in Airbus Industrie, 
but refuse to exercise any control over the indirect aid 
received by their own aircraft manufacturers. We want exactly 
the opposite. We want to see the reimbursable advances 
legitimized, as was provided for in an U.S.-European agreement 
of July 1992 on airplanes with more than 10 seats, and the 
control of indirect aid. We must set up indicators to assess 
the financing of upstream research practiced in the United 
States. This is not always easy, but there are objective data 
such as the NASA budget. We must also reach an agreement on the 
basis for making the calculation. 
  NASA, for example, spends large amounts of money on research 
into the future supersonic aircraft, which has a significant 
impact on many of the technologies currently used, but the 
United States refuses to consider this money to be indirect aid 
as defined in the agreement of July 1992 because there is no 
formal program for developing a supersonic aircraft. We are 
proposing, in effect, to take advantage of the Marrakesh meeting 
to launch the negotiations, which are provided for in the 
agreements concluded on 15 December in Geneva. It must not be 
forgotten that Japan and Canada share the European view: To 
perpetuate and elaborate the 1992 agreement for indirect aid. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] However, we get the impression that 
we 
in Europe are still at the "we have to..." stage with regard to 
the United States, without actually adopting a firm position. 
  [Gallois] The concept of a united Europe is not so easy to 
put into practice in our sector: We have to display a lot of 
pedagogical talent in order to convince certain countries of the 
importance of the stakes and to really activate European 
solidarity. The Saudi affair could be an important factor in 
this. 
  [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What do you recommend for making the 
European system of reimbursable advances evolve toward the 
American system of indirect support? 
  [Gallois] Economically speaking, reimbursable advances are a 
good solution for providing financing because they involve the 
sharing of risks between the companies and the governments, and 
oblige the former to pay back the sums received. Thus, 
Aerospatiale pays back every year several hundred million 
francs. Rather than completely abandoning an intelligent system 
for another one, we should try to strike a balance between the 
two, which is what is stipulated in the 1992 agreement. 
Aerospatiale currently receives less than 0.5 percent of its 
research expenditures in indirect aid, whereas the ceiling set 
by the 1992 agreement is 3 percent of the annual sales of the 
aeronautics industry, and 4 percent of the sales of the company 
concerned. 
  So there is room to evolve more toward indirect support 
without calling into question the concept of reimbursable 
advances. I would also reiterate that these advances, which 
were on the order of 60 percent for past programs, were capped 
at 33 percent by the 1992 agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Yves Mamou: "Government Launches Information </F>
Highway"] 
  [Text] At a 22 February interministerial committee meeting 
at Matignon House chaired by [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur, 
the government appointed a study team headed by Gerard Thery, 
former director general of telecommunications, to start planning 
for the first information highway. The actual building of these 
highways is expected to take about twenty years. Industry 
Minister Gerard Longuet is expected to have an announcement on 
the subject at the next Council of Ministers. 
  On 22 February, at the conclusion of an interministerial 
committee meeting on advance preparations for the vast 
information highway project, the prime minister formally 
launched implementation of an industrial project that will take 
15 to 20 years to complete. It will be one of the most ambitious 
undertakings of the decade to come, as its realization will 
require great perseverance on the part of all the governments 
that will be called on to support it beyond the year 2000. 
  Edouard Balladur took the first step by naming Gerard Thery, 
former director general of telecommunications (today France 
Telecom), to head a study mission. Thery's mission is to 
propose, by the end of April 1994, a timetable along with a 
juridical, financial, and technical framework covering 
everything involved in the building of information highways. 
  The task first of all involves studying, forecasting, and 
organizing the harmonization of telecommunications and 
audiovisual media, and conducting experiments on images 
broadcast on France Telecom's telephone network and distribution 
of telephone communications on cable networks. The experiments 
to be conducted will oblige cable operators, at least initially 
and for as long as the monopoly lasts, to connect up with the 
France Telecom network. 
<H5>  Several Necessities </H5>
  The launching of such a project responds to a variety of 
necessities: 
  First, international economic necessities. Since Bill 
Clinton 
came into office, the United States has embarked on a vast 
regulatory reform that has stimulated and focused the country's 
industrial apparatus as a whole. Telephone companies, cable 
operators, and computer companies are merging and investing 
massively to prepare for the information superhighways that will 
pave the way for an interactive, multimedia world. The advance 
the United States has in this domain compels all developed 
countries to take action, to avoid being left behind. 
  Second, European necessities. Following up on the report of 
the Commission of the European Communities, which in 1992 noted 
the inadequacy of new telephone service offerings and 
disparities in rates throughout Europe, the Council of Ministers 
of the European Union decreed a plan to liberalize the telephone 
sector starting 1 January 1998. As of that date, and despite the 
presence of monopolies in the telecommunications sector, private 
operators will be able to lease capacities on publicly owned 
infrastructure and use them or market them as they best see fit. 
Liberalization is expected to be complete before the year 2000. 
  In its recent white paper on growth, the Brussels Commission 
also confirmed the great potential of multimedia markets 
expected to see strong growth between now and the year 2000--10 
percent per year for audiovisual and 8 percent per year for 
telephone services. At that rate of growth, they would boost 
Europe's GDP by 10 percent by the end of the century. 
  Third, national necessities. The theme of information 
highways may even play an important political role. The closer 
the country gets to the next presidential election, the more 
useful it will be for the current prime minister to have at his 
disposal, instead of a respectable but uninspiring record of 
accomplishment, a far-reaching politico-industrial project 
capable of reducing unemployment and galvanizing public support. 
Such an ambitious endeavor will also have the advantage of 
satisfying the big industrial groups athirst for public-sector 
contracts. Finally, development of electronic highways will 
force the government to rethink the audiovisual system in its 
entirety. The growth and development--separate, for the 
moment--of cable and pay television, and France Telecom's 
defensive strategy in this sector are questions the executive 
branch sooner or later will have to address. 
  Mr. Balladur's government does not seem at all reluctant to 
put strong pressure on France Telecom, whose monopoly on 
international telephone traffic originating in France is already 
threatened by private operators and whose lock on domestic 
traffic is being challenged by mobile telephone operators 
already allowed to use cable network infrastructure to route 
personal communications. Finally, observers are concerned to see 
Deutsche Telekom forging multimedia alliances with Astra and 
Bertelsmann. The regulatory and financial recommendations that 
Gerard Thery makes in his report this May will probably be of 
critical importance for all operators in the sector.

<F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "The Postelection Riddle: </F>
Three Hypotheses Advanced"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Assuming that an opinion poll was required 
to confirm that it will not be easy to form a government after 
the elections, here are the results. 
  In fact, the American press agency KNIGHT-RIDDLER FINANCIAL 
has asked Italians -- via the CIRM [Italian Center for Market 
Research] -- to express their opinion. Now then, 20 percent of 
the interviewees did not even believe that it would be possible 
to form a new government without holding new elections. A more 
substantial proportion (36 percent of the interviewees) believed 
that it would be necessary to wait for at least three months to 
know the name of the new tenant at Palazzo Chigi [government 
seat]. The majority of the voters' sample (somewhat over 50 
percent) is predicting that an understanding will have to be 
reached among forces belonging to more than one coalition in 
order to give birth to the Second Republic's new government. 
  Today, the simple truth is that none of the three alignments 
expects to win a majority of the seats in parliament. 
"Reserved" surveys show that the progressives are in the 
ascendant, that the center is doing better than expected, that, 
conversely, Forza Italia's momentum is diminishing within the 
right-wing coalition, and that, in the north, [League Secretary 
Umberto] Bossi's war on [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi 
will lead to considerable upheavals in the polling booths. A 
general settlement is being predicted: The Right and the Left 
will be almost even, with the center holding the balance. 
  This is why the proposal to form an "institutional" 
government is gaining momentum as the electoral campaign 
develops. This would be a transitional, politically neutral 
government, which would only be requested to complete the 
electoral reform by introducing a majority system, and then step 
down. The "institutional" nature of the Palazzo Chigi team has 
already been referred to by Spadolini [Italian Republican Party 
(PRI) Senate speaker], and [Mino] Martinazzoli [secretary of the 
Italian Popular Party, PPI], and later by [Achille] Occhetto 
[secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] and 
Berlusconi. The last two, however, subsequently qualified their 
statements. The PDS secretary explained that he was envisaging, 
if need be, a "caretaker" government, but he rejected -- with no 
less than four "no's" -- the possibility that men from Botteghe 
Oscure [PDS headquarters] might join the same government as 
Berlusconi's representatives. Forza Italy retorted by utterly 
rejecting what it called "palace agreements or makeshift 
arrangements which smack of historical compromise -- a solution 
favored by the communist or paracommunist coalition...." A 
nondescript government, deprived of any particular color, is 
therefore a simultaneously envisaged and rejected prospect. 
  However, a weighty alternative prospect cannot be ruled out, 
namely, that of a government backed by a genuine political 
majority. This is a convincing hypothesis, which is being 
increasingly mentioned in the various leaders' statements and 
speeches. The center, occupying the middle camp, is 
particularly open to the prospect of alliances. It is looking 
about to make its choice. A temporary agreement with 
Martinazzoli would not be unwelcome to Occhetto, although even 
yesterday the PDS secretary realized how difficult it was to 
steer the progressive ship: As soon as [PDS Deputy Secretary] 
D'Alema spoke again of [Prime Minister] Ciampi, [Communist 
Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, [Rete leader] Orlando, and the 
Greens once again confirmed their opposition. An agreement with 
the center would enable the PDS leader to offset the weight of 
his alignment's extreme wings, and begin to implement his 
strategy, namely, setting up a left-center axis. Of course, 
such things are not mentioned in the course of an electoral 
campaign and, as a matter of fact, Occhetto is not mentioning 
them. However, two days ago he explained that, in any case, his 
party will be a "central" force within the next government. Was 
he thinking in terms of a government including center-left and 
center-right? 
  This is, in fact, the prospect that the pole of freedoms 
fears most. Berlusconi is aware that, all things equal, the 
center would prefer Occhetto to him. He knows that his only 
chance of conquering Palazzo Chigi lies in obtaining an absolute 
majority in parliament or approaching such a majority close 
enough to "involve" single elected representatives of the PPI 
[Italian Popular Party] and Segni's Pact for Italy in supporting 
the government. Above all, he knows that only an overwhelming 
majority, bordering on 50 percent of the vote, would enable him 
to clip the wings of his loathed ally, Bossi. However, it is 
unlikely that any of this will happen. 
  Bossi is an action man, is imaginative, and is convinced of 
one thing at least: The alliance with Forza Italy could be 
fatal for the League. The prospect of freeing the bandwagon 
[League nickname] from Berlusconi's grip is probably becoming 
increasingly attractive to Bossi with every passing day. 
  Therefore, it is not inappropriate to put forward a third 
hypothesis: a government formed around a platform, backed by 
Occhetto's -- and Bossi's -- votes: a basic platform, including 
the introduction of federalist elements, the completion of the 
electoral reform, and the beginning of tax reform; a government 
which the League might well be prepared to back, particularly if 
led by a personality from the north...

<F P=106> [Report by Guido Passalacqua: "Fini Tells League: National </F>
Unity or No Government; `Next Prime Minister? Berlusconi, 
Never'; Bossi Attacks Ally"] 
  [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] Exactly a week before 
the election [Northern League Secretary] Bossi, instead of 
softening his tone, is persisting in his polemic with his ally, 
[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, and refusing to hear any talk 
about [Italian Social Movement (MSI) and National Alliance (AN) 
leader] Fini's joining the "pole of freedoms." The League 
leader urged his supporters to vote for the "pole of freedoms" 
but warned them that the tiller must remain with the League, 
which will decide the right course; otherwise, if Forza Italia 
("the ones with the face powder and the toupees") were to win, 
there would a be a return "to the quagmires of old." 
  "Beware, my friends," Umberto Bossi shouted, "behind 
Berlusconi there stand a certain [former Prime Minister] Giulio 
Andreotti and a certain [former Italian Socialist Party 
Secretary] Bettino Craxi." People will "vote for the pole of 
freedoms because it is the lesser evil, but the problem is the 
balance of forces between the League and its recycled elements." 
  It was a brief but significant rally. It was held right 
outside the San Siro stadium, where Berlusconi perfected his 
ascent toward the public at large: Bossi does not miss a trick. 
  What about the charges leveled at Forza Italia of enjoying 
the Mafia's votes in the south? Bossi replied with a contorted 
argument, but did not defend Berlusconi -- on the contrary. His 
premise was that ever since 1947 the Mafia "has always colluded 
with politics" and that now, after the DC's [Christian 
Democratic Party] operation to destroy the League by means of 
Forza Italia "has failed," "the south no longer has the DC key 
to unlock the coffers of the north and is trying to find 
another; it is taking a businessman from the north and using him 
in the DC's place. How can the south not vote for Berlusconi if 
he is the key that will open the coffers of the north?" 
  [Interior Minister] "Mancino is complaining," Bossi said 
sarcastically, "and saying, `leave a little of the Mafia to the 
DC, too.'" Again Bossi focused on his usual topic: "I am not 
attacking Berlusconi; I am telling the truth." And according to 
Bossi, the truth about his ally is that "Berlusconi for prime 
minister is an impossibility, as I was the first to say. 
Someone with so many business interests -- both the many that I 
see and the many that I do not see -- cannot be prime minister. 
This is why the League is backing Maroni" [Northern League 
lower house floor leader]. In other words, Berlusconi "is an 
example of the old regime based on a duopoly." The regime that 
the League wants to destroy: "In the media, there is RAI [state 
radio and television] with the parties and Fininvest as its 
alternative. This situation must be changed. Beware: The big 
families live off our money, as does the system of party rule." 
This is why he again threatened "an antimonopoly body to 
eliminate privileges and protectionism. We will set up this 
antimonopoly body, and he [Berlusconi] will try to save his 
television stations." Asked why, then, he reached an agreement 
with Forza Italia, he replied: "Out of necessity, not because 
we like Berlusconi." He added: "Berlusconi is the last card 
played by the old regime." 
  What about Fini? "There is no place for the fascists in the 
pole of freedoms," Bossi explained; "they are completely 
excluded. They will never have access to the pole of freedoms, 
and this cannot be otherwise. The pole of freedoms will win, 
and we will govern together with Forza Italia." 
  This was an indirect response to what the National Alliance 
leader said late yesterday morning on the sidelines of a very 
crowded meeting (attended by over 20,000 people). Interviewed 
by a number of journalists about the possibility of forming a 
government with the Northern League, Fini seemed amenable, and 
set two conditions: "Absolute clarity on national unity and 
identity and equal clarity on the duties of a policy of 
solidarity between the strong and weak sectors of society." 
With regard to the National Alliance's chances, Fini said that 
he was certain that the movement will gain over 10 percent.

  [Text] The Mafia is just one of the themes of the electoral 
campaign. The central puzzle remains that of what will happen 
after the vote and the makeup of any possible government. This 
problem has pushed the parties to lay siege to the center in 
order to gain the moderate vote. Mario De Scalzi reports. 
  [De Scalzi] A few days away from polling day, the various 
political groupings appear to have suddenly realized the 
strategic importance of the center. It is from there -- if 
nobody obtains the necessary votes in order to govern alone -- 
that any political alliance will have to be formed. However, 
Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party] 
warned that the center ground is already occupied and that his 
party is not prepared to give up this role. 
  [Begin Martinazzoli recording] If the center were to win, a 
government would be formed 24 hours afterwards. [end recording] 
  [De Scalzi] Giorgio La Malfa [secretary of the Italian 
Republican Party] pointed out that there are so many rifts and 
contradictions within the left-wing and right-wing slates that 
it is for this reason the center will be strengthened. 
  Whether this analysis is right or wrong, [National Alliance 
Party leader] Gianfranco Fini today toned down his argument with 
the Northern League. He said that it would be possible to 
govern with Bossi if certain conditions were laid down. 
  [Begin Fini recording] We must be absolutely clear on the 
concepts of unity and national identity, and there must be 
absolute clarity on the necessity of the politics of solidarity 
between the north and the south and solidarity between the weak 
and the strong. [end recording] 
  [De Scalzi] This move toward the center leaves Umberto Bossi 
completely indifferent. He said in a radio interview that he 
would never back Silvio Berlusconi's candidacy for the post of 
prime minister.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H6>  Euroelections, Legislative Elections </H6>
  The 5 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO published the results of 
a poll on the upcoming European Parliament elections conducted 
on 2 March by the Norma-Gallup organization among 500 
individuals over 18 years of age, with a commentary by Lilia 
Marcos. The poll carried a 4.5 percent margin of error. 
Respondents were asked their choice of parties for the June 
European Parliament elections. Results showed that, with 30.6 
percent of the respondents answering that they do not know, 
Europe "continues to be a distant vision for Portuguese voters," 
Marcos notes. The Social Democratic Party (PSD) won first place 
with 27.2 percent, followed by the Socialist Party (PS) with 
25.4 percent, the Communist Party (PCP) with 5.9 percent, and 
the Center Social Democratic Party (CDS) with 5 percent. Some 
0.3 percent chose "other parties," and 5.6 percent did not 
answer. The poll also revealed that if legislative elections 
were held at this time, the PSD (33 percent) and the PS (31.4 
percent) would be neck and neck, Marcos notes. The PCP and the 
CDS would follow (7.1 percent and 3.3 percent respectively), 
while 20.7 percent would not know, 0.4 percent would choose 
"other parties," and 4.1 percent would not answer. 
<H5>  Youth Attitudes </H5>
  The results of a recent Marktest poll conducted in the 
Greater Lisbon and Greater Porto areas among 200 individuals 
between 18 and 30 and carrying a 6.9 percent margin of error 
appeared in the 2 March Lisbon daily PUBLICO. According to the 
article, results indicated that political activity does not 
interest Portuguese youth, notably those between 18 and 24. In 
fact, 25 percent of the respondents said they take "a lot of 
interest" in politics, 53.5 percent said they have "little 
interest" in it, 20.5 percent expressed "no interest," and 1 
percent did not know or did not answer. When asked whether the 
young are mature enough to be in politics, 61.5 percent answered 
yes, 34.5 percent answered no, and 4 percent did not know or did 
not answer. Finally, respondents were asked whether they belong 
to any party. Some 8.5 percent answered affirmatively and 91.5 
percent answered negatively.

  [Text] In answer to the UN's request for more troops on 
humanitarian missions in Bosnia, a total of 145 Spanish blue 
helmets are traveling to the area between Monday [21 March] and 
Tuesday to reinforce the 1,200 members of the Madrid Group. In 
April the Canaries Group will replace the Madrid one, which has 
been stationed in Bosnia since autumn. 
  A radar detector unit left Madrid on Monday. It comprises 25 
men, 15 vehicles, and an antimortar radar. Its mission is to 
monitor the cease-fire in the city of Mostar. 
  On Tuesday 120 men will leave Seville. Once deployed in the 
conflict area, they will reinforce the monitoring operations and 
will be involved in the rebuilding of Mostar.

<F P=106> [Carmen del Riego report: "Aznar Hardens His Strategy and </F>
Will Focus People's Party's Line on Corruption and Economy"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Jose Maria Aznar has now devised with his 
closest colleagues the strategy that the People's Party will 
apply over the next few months and that represents a significant 
change with respect to the kind of opposition the main 
opposition party has been conducting since the last election. 
The watchword will be "a tougher opposition," and to this end 
the People's Party leadership has decided to focus its line on 
corruption and the government's economic failure, making it 
clear that "the person responsible is Felipe Gonzalez," People's 
Party leadership sources told LA VANGUARDIA. 
  The PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] congress will 
mark 
the turning point for the definitive change of strategy, since 
they wish to prevent Gonzalez from "capitalizing on the closing 
of ranks around him" that could occur, and to this end Jose 
Maria Aznar and the main party leaders will touch on matters of 
corruption and economic failure. 
  According to the sources consulted, an instance of the 
change 
of strategy will be the speech that the People's Party chairman 
will deliver at the convention to be held by the party in 
Torremolinos 26 March, which will be the starting signal for the 
preliminary campaign for the European and Andalusian elections, 
and an event that will be attended by several European leaders. 
However, it will be in the opposition leader's speech in the 
state-of-the-nation debate scheduled for 12 April that Aznar 
will deliver an all-out criticism of the government and, more 
specifically, of Felipe Gonzalez -- in contrast to his recent 
speeches in the house. 
  Again according to the People's Party leadership sources we 
consulted, corruption is crucial in the situation that the 
country is experiencing, and they now believe that "it was a 
mistake" not to raise the issue in the last television debate 
between Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Maria Aznar on the eve of the 
general election, after they had based much of their campaign on 
condemning government corruption. 
<H5>  Process of Decomposition </H5>
  The People's Party leadership believes that "this issue is 
ours" and they cannot remove it from their line, "giving the 
impression that there has been some kind of shady deal with the 
government to cover everything up," although Aznar has already 
begun to raise this issue, to which he did not refer for many 
months. For instance, at a public meeting held in Alcazar de 
San Juan in Ciudad Real yesterday, he said that "the country is 
experiencing a process of decomposition that Felipe Gonzalez is 
unable to halt," and that "every day we come across a new 
scandal." The People's Party will try to take advantage of the 
committees of inquiry that have now been set up in the Congress 
[of Deputies] -- especially the one dealing with the Roldan 
affair and Banesto [Credit Bank of Spain] -- or the appearances 
that could take place with respect to the confidential funds, 
"which are already tainting the Moncloa Palace." 
  This new strategy will also differ in procedures. Aznar, who 
has not met with Felipe Gonzalez since 28 December, "does not 
intend to do so" until the elections, which will mark for the 
People's Party the time to decide whether to try to bring about 
a change of government, if the Socialists lose the elections. 
  For that reason, the same sources assert, nor will 
photographs of People's Party and PSOE leaders negotiating the 
democratic impetus be repeated. This does not mean that there 
will not be talks. The two parties' spokesmen in the Congress 
-- Rodrigo Rato and Carlos Solchaga -- "are talking," but they 
will do so not publicly, "but as we have always done, and always 
making it clear that one side is in power and the other side in 
opposition." 
  These negotiations will be confined to renewing the 
institutions: "This is normal; there had to be an agreement 
between the PSOE and the People's Party to renew other bodies in 
the previous legislative term, too." The aim is "not to give 
the impression that there is an understanding between government 
and opposition," since there is none. 
  The key to these talks will be the renewal of the Spanish 
Radio and Television Company board, without which, the People's 
Party asserts, "there will be no agreement for the other 
institutions." According to the same sources, although the two 
parties' stances are very far apart right now, "there could be 
an agreement next week." The problems lie in the fact that 
while the People's Party wants the number of board members it 
proposes "to be the same as that for the PSOE-CiU [Convergence 
and Union] coalition," the Socialists utterly reject this stance.

<F P=106> [Josep Gisbert report: "Pujol Informs Gonzalez of His </F>
Autonomy Aims for 1994"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Jordi Pujol has informed Felipe 
Gonzalez of the aims that CiU [Convergence and Union] wishes to 
achieve in 1994 in the negotiation on the impetus to autonomy. 
At his 10 February meeting with the prime minister, the 
Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] president proposed 
to him the broad outline of this negotiation, and they have 
discussed these aims over the telephone since then, without its 
being ruled out that Pujol may convey them to him in writing. 
  CiU's intention is that these aims could be achieved in 
1994, 
although not necessarily completely, but at least that they 
should be well under way with a view to their later resolution, 
since Pujol expects progress to be made in this dialogue before 
deciding on his support for the state budgets for 1995. This 
negotiation, which will be examined by the liaison committee 
between Democratic Convergence of Catalonia and Democratic Union 
of Catalonia today, is being conducted discreetly in order to 
avoid the suspicions that it could otherwise arouse in certain 
political and social circles; although it is proceeding at a 
very slow pace right now, it is Pujol's intention to accelerate 
it after the Spanish Socialist Workers Party congress. 
  The point that Pujol deems crucial for making possible a 
different implementation of autonomy -- which he believes to be 
perfectly feasible by virtue of the diversity allowed by the 
Constitution -- is that of the basic laws, which must not 
encroach upon the autonomous communities' exercise of their 
powers. For this reason, CiU proposes that some that have 
interpreted the [autonomy] statute in a restrictive manner be 
amended. 
  The extension of the duties of the Mossos d'Esquadra 
[autonomous police force] is another aspect that Pujol deems 
essential and that Councillor Maria Eugenia Cuenca and 
[Interior] Minister Antoni Asuncion have already discussed at 
several meetings. The negotiation, which is believed to be well 
under way, has as its basis the autonomous police bill and could 
include some formula for integrating the National Police into 
what is believed should be the Catalan police, comprising as 
basic elements the Mossos d'Esquadra and the local police forces. 
  Turning the Generalitat into the state's ordinary 
administration in Catalonia -- the single administration in 
Manuel Fraga's terminology -- is also on the agenda, and has 
already been achieved with respect to agriculture, on which an 
agreement was signed 15 February. In the sphere of justice, CiU 
is seeking a reform of the Organic Law of the Judiciary, which, 
according to coalition sources, the minister is already 
preparing. 
  Regional planning is also among CiU's aims, especially with 
respect to coordination on the investments that the state makes 
in Catalonia, the Generalitat's involvement in the cohesion 
funds from the European Union, and the demand that the 
government respect autonomous powers concerning the environment. 
Public health funding is the last major area that Pujol wants 
unblocked. On this point, the Generalitat has the support of 
the Andalusian Junta [autonomous government].

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, in </F>
Copenhagen, by John Humphries, in London -- live] 
  [Text] [Humphries] Mr. Helveg Petersen, Denmark took a 
fairly skeptical view over Maastricht in order to protect its 
own sovereignty. Don't you therefore have some sympathy for the 
British view on the voting system? 
  [Petersen] Well, I have a lot of sympathy for the United 
Kingdom, for Great Britain; we have in many issues been in 
agreement, but on this issue I think there are very solid 
reasons why the predominant view inside the European Union -- 
that is the view of 10 out of 12 countries -- is the correct one 
and I would mention at least three major reasons why it is so. 
First of all, it is the historical precedent when Denmark, the 
United Kingdom, and Ireland joined, we readjusted the level for 
qualified majority. Accordingly it was done at the time of our 
entry, it was done again with the entry of Greece, with the 
entry of Spain and Portugal. All the time, it has been the 
Community rule around 70 percent of the vote constituted a 
qualified majority, that is, 30 percent would be a block... 
  [Humphries, interrupting] And the other two reasons? 
  [Petersen] That is the overriding interest of my country, 
and 
I think indeed also of the United Kingdom -- that is, that the 
Nordic countries and Austria now could become members. We 
should not delay that, and it will be delayed if we do not agree 
on another figure than 23. And thirdly, what is really at stake 
here also for the United Kingdom, for Denmark, for others, is 
that the government conference in 1996, which is going to set 
the rules for the community of the future, that that is an 
enlarged Community taking these decisions, including the 
Scandinavian countries and Austria. I think that is deeply also 
in the interests of England. 
  [Humphries] Isn't the reality though, that when you sit at 
that table in Brussels on Tuesday [22 March] with Douglas Hurd 
and all the rest of you, you're going to have a lot of talk and 
a lot of negotiating, and you're going to emerge perhaps a bit 
bleary-eyed on Wednesday morning, the early hours of Wednesday 
morning with a compromise, with a fudge, isn't that the reality? 
  [Petersen] Well I hope so, I certainly hope so. I think all 
parties to the debate now have made their points, I've certainly 
made mine, others have done so as well, and now is the time to 
find solutions, and we should do that on Tuesday. 
  [Humphries] You say find solutions, do you mean by that find 
a compromise? Are you in the first place prepared to shift on 
the matter of 23 and 27? 
  [Petersen] I think the only realistic view is to say -- 23 
that can never become an agreed position in the council... 
  [Humphries, interrupting] Never under any circumstances? 
  [Peterson] Oh no, I don't think so. That will never be a 
position that could create a common position. Therefore we will 
have to be looking for something else. I think Britain should 
be very clear on this. There will never be an agreement on 23, 
we will have to look for something else. I think there's a lot 
of good sense in the proposition that has been put forward 
saying it's 27, yes, but if the majority of 23 or more are 
opposed it would take a period of rethinking in good faith 
trying then to establish a formula that could be a consensus of 
[words indistinct]. 
  [Humphries] So what are you saying here, I'm not quite sure 
about what you are saying, whether you're saying we can put off 
the decision, the entire decision, or whether.... 
  [Petersen, interrupting] No, I was talking about a 
compromise, saying well it's 27, that's a blocking in minority, 
but if there is any voting in council, 23 or more but not 27, 
that would create a special situation up to the moment when we 
have the government conference in 1996. 
  [Humphries] Right, so you're talking about some sort of 
cooling-off period. 
  [Petersen] Yes. 
  [Humphries] For how long? 
  [Petersen] Of rethinking? 
  [Humphries] Yes. 
  [Petersen] One month, it could be twice one month, that's 
not 
so important, one could look for solutions along these lines. I 
think that should be acceptable to everyone, and such a 
cooling-off period -- or think-again period I would prefer to 
call it -- is absolutely very valuable. It is true that it 
gives a chance for national parliaments and national public 
opinion to make itself felt in the debate. 
  [Humphries] There is no way, is there, in which you can 
separate, decouple these two issues, that's to say the 
acceptance of the four new members and the question of qualified 
majority voting. So you say OK, we'll have the four in and then 
we'll decide, we'll sort it out afterward? 
  [Petersen] No, that's not possible, for very good legal 
reasons, after all, what we have to sign with the four applicant 
countries is a new treaty and the treaty or adoption of the 
treaty, so there will have to be texts in the agreement also 
covering this problem. 
  [Humphries] Let me remind you of what you did, I think, say 
earlier this week, the British position, I quote, is absolutely 
untenable, this cannot be solved by another meeting, the Brits 
should call us when they have reconsidered. Is that still your 
position? 
  [Petersen] It is my position, as I said just a moment ago, 
everybody including myself have made our positions clear, we 
shall now seek solutions, do it on Tuesday and come up with the 
result. 
  [Humphries] Right, and so if Mr. Hurd is not prepared to 
accept the compromise that you seem now to be suggesting, no 
deal? 
  [Petersen] Well in that case, there's no enlargement and 
that 
is, I think, deeply regrettable. It is not possible to have 23 
and enlargement, that is very clear now. 
  [Humphries] Mr. Helveg Peterson, thank you very much.

  [Text] Several pieces of metal containing radioactive 
substances could have arrived in Finland from Estonia in metal 
scrap. According to the Estonian Security Police, the material 
originates from scrapped Russian minesweepers. The 
radioactivity of the radiation sources in military use may be 
lethally high, the Estonian authorities warn. Ulla-Maija 
Maeaettaenen reports from Tallinn: 
  [Maeaettaenen] The Estonian Security Police have already 
investigated the origin of three pieces of metal the size of 
attache cases and containing radioactive substances found here. 
The first was found in mid-January in the stores of the 
Estonian state metal export company, EMEX. The others were 
found somewhat later, one in a truck container in the port. 
This consignment was on its way illegally to the West, 
bypassing the state's export company. 
  Juri Pihl, the head of the Estonian Security Police, told 
Yleisradio today that two pieces of metal containing radioactive 
substances originate from two minesweepers sold by the Russian 
Army for scrap. The parts belonged to the vessel's security 
system. One piece came from a Hovercraft. All these 
radioactive pieces have been buried near Tallinn in a store for 
radioactive substances. 
  The vessels, from which the radiating scrap originated, were 
sold to an enterprise operating in Narva. A Finnish company 
acted as distributor of the metal. According to the Estonian 
Security Police, it distributes most of the scrap metal exported 
from Estonia to foreign countries. Juri Pihl, the head of the 
Estonian Security Police, says that some 10 radiating pieces are 
missing; a couple of radiating pieces may also be in Finland. 
The radiation from one piece recently destroyed in Estonia rose 
to about 200 roentgen an hour or about two sieverts an hour, 
which means that the maximum annual dosage by Finnish standards 
was reached in only a few minutes. 
  According to Juri Pihl, lethal metal pieces may find their 
way to the West with scrap metal from Latvia and Lithuania too, 
without anybody knowing. He is also concerned about seven 
Russian Navy vessels lying at the bottom of the Tallinn mine 
harbor. They may also carry parts containing radioactive 
substances. 
  The metal trade is also being linked to organized crime. The 
Estonian Security Police recently arrested here two of the chief 
underworld bosses who are accused of unlawful possession of 
weapons. The men in police custody were in total control of the 
underworld, distributing so-called paid franchises to other 
mafia groups. 
  According to the Security Police, three mafia groups are 
permanently operating in Estonia. Many of their leaders have 
fled the country; several may be staying either in Finland or 
Sweden. They have Finnish and Swedish visas in their passports. 
The trial of the recently arrested mafia bosses will begin here 
in Estonia this week, Juri Pihl told Yleisradio. This is 
Ulla-Maija Maeaettaenen in Tallinn.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Finland Learning Submarine Hunting </F>
in Sweden"] 
  [Text] Finland and Sweden are going to study possibilities 
of establishing closer cooperation regarding signal lights and 
sonar scanning in antisubmarine warfare [ASW]. Joint training is 
also something Finland would like to discuss. 
  Within two weeks a group of Finnish experts -- among them 
Commander Juha Rannikko, chief of the ASW Office on the Naval 
Headquarters Staff -- will go to Sweden in order to discuss with 
their Swedish colleagues what forms of closer cooperation could 
be achieved. 
  Swedish naval sources refused comment on this matter, which 
can be seen as involving a sensitive area. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Soren Trygg of the Swedish Defense 
Staff's 
Naval Command stated in response to a direct question from 
[Swedish news service] FLT that he "is prevented from commenting 
on this," and refused to give any further information on the 
issue. 
  The background to this is that the Finnish and Swedish naval 
chiefs in discussions held in 1992 and 1993 came to agreement on 
studying the possibilities for developing cooperation and 
exchanging experiences "in analysis and operations for passive 
and active sonar systems." 
  Finland would like to have access to the Swedish Navy's 
advanced training simulators, equipment which Finland lacks. 
  "We will first and foremost look at the simulators that the 
Swedish Navy has. We are even considering acquiring similar 
equipment ourselves. Another alternative we discussed is whether 
we could be allowed to train our own operators on the Swedish 
equipment," said Rannikko in a telephone interview with the FLT 
news service. 
  On the other hand, said Rannikko, it is not a question of 
any 
active cooperation between Sweden and Finland in hunting foreign 
submarines. 
  Rannikko refused to comment on how many Finnish military 
personnel would be involved in such possible training in Sweden.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Bjorn Mansson: "Red-Green Majority"] </F>
  [Text] A red-green majority in the next parliamentary 
election right now appears probable, asserts Bjorn Mansson, who 
in the latest poll on party support does not discern any 
clear-cut effects from the presidential election. 
  The Social Democratic Party [SDP] is continuing its 
triumphal 
procession in the polls. According to the most recent one, which 
was conducted by Taloustutkimous for the Center Party press 
organ SUOMENMAA, the SDP is up to a new record 33 percent -- or 
one-third -- of the electorate. 
  This is all of 11 points -- or, stated another way, no less 
than 50 percent! -- over the 22-percent result in the 1991 
parliamentary election. The rise has been accelerating ever 
since the 27 percent posted in the municipal elections of 1992. 
  Since the Left Alliance has risen to more than 10 percent 
over the Greens despite an overall declining trend, in just over 
seven weeks [since the first round of the presidential 
elections], a red-green majority in next year's parliamentary 
election right now seems probable. 
  In the nonsocialist camp the situation is most bleak for the 
Center Party: a drop from almost 25 percent in 1991 to a bare 19 
percent in the municipal elections, to 18 now, which is almost 
as dramatic as the SDP's advance. 
  It appears significantly better for the Conservative Party, 
whose voter support of just over 19 percent in both 1991 and 
1992 dropped only to 18.5 percent now. The same can be said of 
the Swedish People's Party, whose 4.7 percent is nearly the 
"normal." 
  It is interesting that the Rural Party's risk of dropping 
below the threshold for parliamentary representation is now 
confirmed. 
  A main reason for the poll trend is obvious: Governing 
responsibility in times of economic crisis has impacted the 
largest governing party, while the SDP has benefited from its 
role as leading opposition party. What is interesting regarding 
this, however, is that the Conservative Party and Swedish 
People's Party coalition partners have not been hit as hard as 
the prime minister's party. 
  It is starting to become really urgent for the Center Party 
to convince voters, with the aid of an economic upturn, that its 
policies have been the right ones. 
  On the other hand, it seems the presidential election has 
not 
left any clear-cut influences on the parties' poll figures. 
  It is possible that the SDP's advance could be explained as 
an "Ahtisaari effect," if it were not that the advance turned 
upward during the survey period, i.e., after Ahtisaari's 
election win. 
  [Conservative Party presidential candidate] Ilaskivi's 
fiasco 
has not affected his party -- not to speak of Andersson's [Left 
Alliance]! 
  In the same way, Vayrynen's result has not impacted the 
Center Party; he did better than his party, despite Korhonen and 
Kuuskoski. The Swedish People's Party will have to gaze at the 
moon to find some "Rehn effect." 
  Even the Green's decline can hardly be explained by the 
absence of their own candidate. 
  In the future the EU [European Union] issue will decide 
much.

spent on space research by promoting projects with realistic 
economic prospects. Sheryl Riggins has more. 
  [Riggins] Finland's leading space researchers were out in 
force on Monday [21 March] for the publication of the new space 
research program. Finland does not plan to spend money on just 
any project under the illustrious heading space, and Finns are 
not seeking a spot for a Finnish astronaut on spaceflights. 
Instead Finnish space research will be focusing on 
down-to-earth projects with realistic applications. 
  Finnish scientists will be concentrating on three main areas 
-- telecommunication satellites, remote mapping, and basic space 
research. Finland already has extensive background in precisely 
these areas of study. Remote mapping is a field of particular 
interest, because it can bring significant economic rewards some 
time in the future. Remote mapping is used, for instance, in 
exploration for mineral deposits, charting timber reserves, 
predicting the weather, and providing navigational assistance to 
ships -- all of which are sellable services. The new national 
space research strategy comes on the eve of Finland's entry into 
the European Space Agency, ESA. Joining the club [as heard] 
will cost about 100 million marks a year. The Finnish space 
researchers believe that at least that much can be earned in 
industrial orders.

  [Text] [Croatian] Foreign Minister Mate Granic held talks 
with his Norwegian counterpart Bjorn Tore Godal in Oslo today. 
  Minister Granic told reporters that the talks focused on the 
situation in the former Yugoslavia, particularly in the light of 
the latest Washington agreements. He informed the Norwegian 
foreign minister of Croatian activities at the United Nations 
and the Security Council, as well as of perspectives for future 
negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs and the local Serbs in the 
occupied areas in Croatia. 
  The Croatian foreign minister said Norway congratulated 
Croatia on the [Croat-Muslim] agreement as the foundation for 
future peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added that Norway 
believes the problems of the UN-protected areas in Croatia and 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina will have to be solved simultaneously. 
Minister Granic said that Norway is interested in developments 
in the former Yugoslavia and is ready to provide humanitarian 
aid and lend assistance in the reconstruction. Norway will soon 
hold a referendum on joining the EU [European Union], and one of 
Croatia's main aims is to obtain associate membership in the EU, 
Minister Granic said, adding that this will be discussed further. 
  The two ministers will resume talks over a working lunch 
when 
they will discuss mutual relations. An agreement on technical 
and cultural cooperation, which is soon to be signed, is of 
special importance, as well as improved economic relations 
between the two countries.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Carl Bildt by Maria </F>
Romantschuk; place and date not given: "The Referendum Must Not 
Lead to a Political Conflict"] 
  [Text] Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt has learned 
something new. At the Nordic Council session in Stockholm last 
week, he was introduced to the expression "late milking." "All 
this must of course be seen from the standpoint of Finland's 
specific situation. In my view, a Swedish judgment on this 
matter is neither easy nor warranted." Bildt is quite clearly 
convinced about Finland's negotiatiated agreement with the EU 
[European Union]. It is what he believed from the very 
beginning, although he did not want to question his Finnish 
counterpart [Prime Minister] Esko Aho's gloomy reaction to the 
information about his achievements in Brussels a couple of weeks 
ago. 
  "There are always things that have to be interpreted from 
within an agreement," Bildt added diplomatically. Sweden has 
similar problems and needs complementary measures at the 
national level. This does not actually affect the agreement with 
the EU. The problem of complementary national financing of 
regional support also arises in Sweden. Bildt pointed out that, 
unlike Finland, Sweden has been adapting to EU price levels ever 
since the mid- 1960's, based on a belief that sooner or later it 
would be knocking on the EU's door. 
  "It has always been my firm belief that this would happen 
sooner or later, although my time-frame estimates have varied 
from the short term to a pessimistic distant future." But this 
Nordic advocate of Europe has always been sure about Swedish EU 
membership: "I think I became convinced about the present 
schedule in 1987-88. That is when the events became 
predictable." Bildt was referring to the 1985 European Single 
Act decision. The white paper resolutions were to be 
implemented by the end of 1992, and that paved the way for an 
extension. The prime minister and leader of the Swedish 
Conservative Party states that all his efforts from 1987-88 
onward were focused on getting Sweden's application submitted by 
1991-92, negotiations in 1993, ratification in 1994, and 
membership in 1995. In other words, Carl Bildt has worked hard 
for Swedish accession to the EU over the last seven years. 
<H5>  Opening of the Nordic Council Meeting </H5>
  "I am convinced about membership in 1995," he said, without 
showing any doubt as to the outcome of the planned consultative 
referendum. The date of the referendum has not been agreed upon 
yet, but negotiations are now under way between the government 
and the opposition. Bildt would prefer to see it take place in 
June, while the opposition and one of the government coalition 
parties, the Liberal Party, have indicated that the referendum 
cannot be held before November, in other words a couple of 
months after the elections. "As far as I can judge, there is a 
parliament majority for a referendum in June, with or without 
the Liberal Party." 
<H5>  Must Not Become an Issue of Conflict </H5>
  Bildt does not see any point in turning the referendum 
question into a political conflict. "Trying to split a nation 
is a bad way of trying to unite Europe." The parties in Sweden 
are now evaluating the pros and cons of the alternatives. Bildt 
does not want to predict how long the discussions will last, but 
he does not believe it is absolutely essential for the 
referendum to be out of the way before the 18 September 
elections. 
  "The important thing for us is to get a good result," he 
said, adding that a referendum in June does not mean a great 
personal political victory for him. After the successful 
outcome of the negotiations, there is only one good result in 
the Swedish prime minister's eyes: a yes to the EU from the 
majority of the people. 
  Bildt does not think that a change of power in the middle of 
the campaign would influence the outcome of the referendum. "It 
may be significant if the Social Democrats lose the elections, 
which I think they will, in which case their party will be in 
fairly bad shape this fall. If the referendum is not held 
before November, there is a danger or a chance that the 
conservatives will no longer be in power on the planned date of 
the country's accession to the EU. Various opinion polls 
indicate that a change of power can be expected in Sweden this 
coming September. The Social Democrats have a strong position 
and in the eyes of many it takes a good deal of self-confidence 
and optimism today for a Conservative leader in Sweden to 
believe in victory, no matter how little significance he sees in 
the opinion polls: This is relatively limited," he said, and 
added that he is confident about "the evolution of political and 
economic events." 
  Bildt believes in a yes to the EU at the referendum 
regardless of who is in power after the fall elections. This 
yes will be the outcome of a debate which informs and involves 
the people: "The problem with the Social Democrats is that they 
did not believe we could reach such a good agreement so 
quickly." According to Bildt, this has led to the Social 
Democrats campaigning predominantly for a no vote. Today, a 
clear majority of Social Democrats -- some 75 percent -- are 
against EU membership. "The longer they postpone the start of a 
proper yes campaign, the more problematic the no situation will 
become within the party. Problems are seldom solved by waiting." 
  The Social Democrats Have No Opinion 
  And the social democrats have waited. Last fall they decided 
to adjourn the party congress because they could not achieve 
unanimity on the EU issue. "It is remarkable that they have not 
made any decision in principle. They are the only political 
party without a principle on this issue." 
  While the discussion about the date of the Swedish 
referendum 
is going on, Bildt does not really believe in simultaneous 
plebiscites in Finland, Sweden, and Norway, but he is sure that 
Norway will succeed: "I think they are very near a solution." 
And he is just as sure of a yes vote in the referendum to 
follow: "Opinion polls record the opinions of yesterday, or 
rather, they reflect an approximate, often fairly unreliable 
picture of yesterday's situation. The only thing one can be 
absolutely sure about is that things look different tomrrow," he 
added to his somewhat enigmatic view on opinion polls. Bildt 
was referring to opinion polls in Norway from 1972 when the no 
ethos predominated to a considerably greater degree than today. 
  The Swedish Prime Minister takes the view that Norway cannot 
manage without the EU, not even with its oil and fish, because 
that is not what it is all about: "What is at stake is 
political influence in shaping the Europe of the future, and not 
sitting and leading a dull life on an island. Of course, one 
can pursue a Robinson Crusoe-like policy, cracking a coconut now 
and then. But that will hardly satisfy any nation in the long 
run." 
<H5>  Isolation Is No Solution </H5>
  Bildt does not believe that the EU poses any direct threats 
other than in the guise of bad decisions. But of course, such 
decisions could also be made by parliaments in Sweden and 
Finland. "It is very hard for me to see that there is anything 
intrinsically wrong in cooperation. You either cooperate or 
remain isolated," he argued. "I cannot find a single valid 
argument why we in the Nordic countries should be isolated from 
European cooperation. Not a single one!" 
  He is not laboring under any illusions, however; this 
cooperation is likely to be laborious, time-consuming, and 
complicated, but he thinks it is worth it: "One must, of 
course, give up some of one's independence in exchange for 
something else. This happens with people who get married. I 
suppose, or rather know, that they give up some of their 
independence while being aware of gaining other benefits from 
the arrangement," he added firmly. 
  Carl Bildt believes that the Nordic countries will work 
closely together as members of the EU. Among other things, they 
will be actively supporting membership for the Baltic states and 
other countries like Hungary and Poland, which were seen last 
week knocking discreetly on the EU's door.... 
  The Swedish Prime Minister is convinced that membership in 
the EU is also a guarantee of security, but he does not think 
Finland needs the EU specifically for that reason: "Soviet 
policy always included an expansionist element. This trait is 
not present in Russian policy today." Neither does Bildt see 
any threat of this kind in Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Bildt does 
not set much store by his threats to put the Russian Army on a 
war footing: "I find it hard to believe that anyone can win 
many votes by promising a super-Afghanistan as an electoral 
pledge." 
  Bildt does not doubt Russia's ability to take a tough stand 
to safeguard its national interests, even if there is a risk 
that this may lead to conflicts -- although not military ones -- 
with the West: "But I think that a prevalently ideological 
attitude belongs to the past." Bildt believes that security and 
stability will increase in Europe with its northernmost 
countries as members of the EU: "I see this as one of the 
strongest arguments for membership. It offers a security bonus." 
NATO membership, on the other hand, is not necessary and the 
candidate countries will, in time, define their relationship to 
the WEU [Western European Union]. 
  What matters to Carl Bildt today is to pilot Sweden into the 
EU. He is now on the home stretch of his race to make an old 
dream come true.

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, arrived to Cyprus tonight. In a 
statement at Larnaca Airport, Clark said that during his 
presence in Cyprus he looks forward to constructive talks. He 
added that it is important that everyone knows that time is 
passing and that with this set of events we want to conclude an 
agreement on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] as soon as 
possible. And if this is not possible, we must know it as soon 
as possible. 
  Clark said that as a practical measure we want a clear 
indication by the end of the week when the UN secretary general 
will submit his report to the Security Council.

  [Text] The new round of the proximity talks on the 
implementation of the confidence-building measures package began 
in Cyprus today. Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special 
envoy in Cyprus, met with President Rauf Denktas at noon today. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that a 
document was submitted including certain changes within the 
framework of the views and concerns expressed by the Turkish 
Cypriot side. Pointing out that he cannot comment on the 
document before studying it, Denktas noted: We will see if the 
changes effected are satisfactory after evaluating the document. 
  Asked if any progress was achieved, Denktas responded that 
the talks are continuing and it is not right to comment before 
reaching a conclusion. In reply to a question, the president 
remarked that the Greek Cypriot Administration accepted the 
proposal to have two gates at Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport, adding: 
The customs procedures at the Turkish Cypriot gate will be 
undertaken by us. Nothing will be signed unless this is 
accepted. 
  Noting that he did not receive an invitation to go to New 
York, Denktas said that every day and every week is important 
with regard to negotiations, but one can say that this is a very 
important week. 
  Answering a question on how the negotiations will be 
affected 
if there is change in government in Turkey in the wake of local 
elections, Denktas explained that the talks are conducted within 
the framework of Turkish policy and they cannot be interrupted 
because of a change in government. 
  In his statement after the meeting, Clark reported that he 
submitted to Denktas a written document relating to observations 
and concerns raised during the last two weeks of the proximity 
talks. Pointing out that this document will be discussed during 
tomorrow's meeting, Clark responded to a question by saying that 
Denktas and Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis have not been invited 
to New York. Clark added that he cannot make any predictions 
concerning the leaders' meeting in New York. If the New York 
meeting is to be constructive, Clark declared, progress must be 
achieved in the proximity talks in Lefkosa. Asked if Denktas 
displayed a positive attitude during today's meeting, Clark said 
yes. 
  After the talks, the Turkish Cypriot delegation led by 
Denktas held a meeting to assess the document submitted by the 
United Nations. The proximity talks will continue tomorrow as 
well. Denktas will hold a meeting with Clark at 1100 tomorrow. 
Clark met with Kliridhis over luncheon today.

  [Text] The UN secretary general's special representative in 
Cyprus today handed to the two sides in Cyprus the UN's final 
proposal for the implementation of the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's]. In a statement after his meeting with 
President Glavkos Kliridhis at the Presidential Palace this 
afternoon, Mr. Joe Clark avoided giving a direct answer as to 
whether the Greek Cypriot side has accepted the three basic 
principles set by the United Nations on the CBM's 
implementation. However, he expressed the hope that there will 
be an agreement between the two sides. 
  Mr. Clark noted: Today, I presented the UN's final proposal 
on the CBM's to both leaders and they asked for time to study 
it. Mr. Clark further said that he will meet separately with 
the two leaders tomorrow and expressed the conviction that then 
he will have a clearer idea of where things stand. 
  Asked if there was any reaction by the Greek Cypriot side to 
the plans, Mr. Clark said that he established there is a 
willingness to study the plan before any answer is given. 
Responding to a question whether he expects an answer tomorrow, 
Mr. Clark said that everybody knows that the UN secretary 
general must submit a report to the Security Council at the end 
of March and the report will either refer to an agreement or to 
the failure of the talks. Mr. Clark added that Mr. Butrus-Ghali 
will also have to give the reasons for a possible failure and 
noted that the end of the month is not far away. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the Greek 
Cypriot side will study the whole document, which constitutes an 
amended version of the previous document with more detailed 
references, and adopt a position tomorrow in light of the 
positions taken by the Turkish Cypriot side and the UN secretary 
general's representatives. 
  The spokesman further stressed that the Greek Cypriot side 
does not intend to endlessly exchange documents and demands that 
the Turkish Cypriot side take a clear position on the documents. 
  At his meeting with Rauf Denktas this morning, Mr. Clark 
said 
that the three principles of the new document refer to: 
  First, the acceptance of the need for the existence of a UN 
administration, which should exist because of an agreement 
between the leaders of the two communities. 
  Second, the authority of this administration must be based 
on 
the same system being followed at the United Nations, according 
to which the authority and jurisdictions of the secretary 
general and his envoys stem from the Security Council. 
  Third, there must be clear benefits for both sides.

  [Excerpts] The new round of indirect talks on the 
implementation of the package of confidence-building measures 
began today. Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative, held talks with President Rauf Denktas and 
submitted a new document on the implementation of the package of 
confidence-building measures at noon today. Gustav Feissel, the 
UN secretary general's alternate special representative; John 
Paul Cavanaugh, the UN secretary general's special envoy; and UN 
experts attended the meeting. Also attending were Ozker Ozgur, 
minister of state and deputy prime minister; Atay Ahmet Rasid, 
minister of foreign affairs and defense; Presidential Advisers 
Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun; and Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Ozer Koray. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking after his talks with Joe Clark, President Denktas 
said that he has received a new document, which contains certain 
changes in accordance with the views and anxieties the Turkish 
Cypriot side has expressed in the indirect talks. 
  [Begin Denktas recording] Considering the work we have 
carried out with Mr. Feissel, we informed them that they should 
brief us on the points they have deemed as important in the 
talks we have had for so many days. We said that they should do 
so that we may be able to proceed. So, they have made certain 
changes to the document. We shall study them and meet again 
tomorrow. We have been informed that certain changes have been 
made to come closer to our position. However, we shall make an 
assessment to establish whether or not the changes will satisfy 
us. [end recording] 
  A journalist asked the following: Is a deadlock possible at 
this point? We have asked Mr. Joe Clark this question. He said 
that a significant rapprochement has been achieved on basic 
principles. 
  Denktas replied by saying that the new document has to be 
studied before that question can be answered. Regarding another 
question, Denktas recalled that the Greek Cypriot Administration 
has agreed to the establishment of two doors at Nicosia Airport 
and noted: The customs formalities behind the door open to the 
Turkish Cypriot side will be managed by Turkish Cypriot 
officials. Nothing can be achieved if this is not accepted. 
  Denktas said that he has not received an invitation to visit 
New York and described each day and week in the talks as 
important. However, he also said that the talks have currently 
entered a very important week. Asked to comment on how a change 
in the Turkish Government after the local elections on 27 March 
may affect the talks in Cyprus, Denktas recalled that the talks 
are within the framework of Turkey's policy and noted that they 
cannot be suspended just because of a change in government in 
Ankara.

  [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative in Cyprus, said that the views 
of the two sides are identical on some of the seven key points 
of the proximity talks agenda on the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's]. In a statement made tonight after meeting 
President Glavkos Kliridhis, Feissel added that other points 
must be further clarified. He said he was satisfied that the 
procedure is progressing well. Feissel added: But, if the two 
sides do not go all the way, what has been achieved so far 
essentially means nothing. 
  Feissel said that with the conclusion of this week's talks, 
which focused on the UN notes, the positions of the two sides 
were determined to a large degree. He said that these positions 
will form the basis of next week's talks. He also said that he 
is convinced that if both sides work toward this goal, an 
agreement on the CBM's can be reached this month. 
  Asked what has been the benefit of the talks so far, Feissel 
said that the form and ways to implement the CBM's on the legal 
regime of UN control of Famagusta and the benefit to the two 
sides from the opening of the fenced-off area and Nicosia 
Airport has been clarified. He added that Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, is 
arriving at a very good time for the talks and aims to help the 
negotiating procedure. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the Greek 
Cypriot side does not yet have a complete picture of the Turkish 
Cypriot positions. He said the Greek Cypriot side presented its 
positions on Feissel's notes this week. He added that the 
United Nations aims to bring the two sides closer to an 
agreement and stressed that the Greek Cypriot side does not 
reject Feissel's notes on the headlines of the talks agenda. 
  The spokesman concluded that a new round of talks, which 
will 
be more intense than the talks held so far, will be held next 
week with Clark's participation.

  [Text] Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy 
under secretary, has declared that if the content of the 
confidence-building measures package is eroded during the course 
of the proximity talks, then naturally the Turkish Cypriot side 
will have to make a reassessment of the situation. Ulucevik 
arrived in the island today to be briefed by Turkish Cypriot 
officials with regard to the latest phase of the talks 
concerning the confidence-building measures package. 
  In a statement to a TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency] 
correspondent at Ercan [Tymbou] State Airport, Ulucevik said 
that, on the basis of the conviction that the package will 
facilitate a comprehensive solution, Turkey and the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus will not in principle change their 
attitude unless the package is amended. 
  Ulucevik is accompanied by Ertugrul Apakan, Turkish Foreign 
Ministry's deputy director for Greek and Cypriot affairs. 
Ulucevik and Apakan will remain in north Cyprus for two days.

  [Excerpts] Police are continuing a broad investigation to 
locate and arrest the perpetrators of last night's cold-blooded 
murder of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, a specialist on Turkish affairs 
and chairman of the Committee of Solidarity with Kurdistan. 
Throughout the night and this morning, police officers and men 
carried out a very thorough search of the area around 
Yeoryiadhis' home on Thoukidhidhou Street in Aglanjia to locate 
evidence. Police dogs were also used during the search. 
  The police announced that they are looking for a man of 
30-35 
who was seen leaving the scene at high speed aboard a small 
motorcycle of the Vespa type. According to the police 
announcement, this man is well built with short black hair and 
was wearing a dark sports jacket and dark trousers. [passage 
omitted] 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the police 
have 
information that yesterday afternoon, a foreign national was 
asking around the area near the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation 
offices for information on the whereabouts of Thoukidhidhou 
Street, where the murdered man lived. The government spokesman 
also said that police will publish a sketch of the person within 
the day. 
  President Glavkos Kliridhis will raise the issue of 
Yeoryiadhis' murder with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's 
special representative on Cyprus, with whom he is having a 
working luncheon at the Presidential Palace now within the 
framework of the proximity talks for the confidence-building 
measures. President Kliridhis this morning asked police for a 
report on Yeoryiadhis' murder as well on the recent arrest of 
four foreign students in the yard of the Omeriye Mosque in 
Nicosia. 
  Responding to correspondents' questions before his meeting 
with [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas this morning in the 
occupied areas, on whether he agrees with the view that 
Yeoryiadhis' murder was aimed against the talks process, Clark 
said he did not know the details of the tragedy and that he did 
not wish to comment. Asked whether he considers the murder as a 
blow to the confidence-building measures, Clark expressed the 
conviction that progress on the measures can continue. He also 
expressed regret over Yeoryiadhis' murder but repeated that the 
process will continue. 
  The government spokesman said Yeoryiadhis' murder is part of 
the Turkish Secret Services actions that aim to hurt the 
movement for Kurdistan. He also said it cannot be ruled out 
that another aim of the murder is to hurt the talks on the 
Cyprus issue. Responding to a question, Kasoulidhis said 
Yeoryiadhis' murder affects the climate of the talks. The 
spokesman also said the government will show the necessary 
response to the needs of the victim's family in such cases. 
  The political parties issued statements blaming Ankara for 
the murder. The political parties condemn with disgust the 
cowardly murder and call on the government to make every effort 
to solve it. They also repeat the solidarity of the Cypriot 
people with the struggle of the Kurds. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis today raised the issue 
of the abominable assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis to UN 
official Joe Clark, who expressed his regret for the incident. 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the 
government will wait for the official results of the police 
investigations before proceeding with diplomatic steps in the 
next few days. Mr. Kasoulidhis added that the government wants 
to have a strong case, as he described it, so that no one will 
draw conclusions by reductio ad absurdum. 
  Joe Clark, the UN Secretary General's special representative 
in Cyprus, said that the assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis 
does not fall within the framework of the UN secretary general's 
mission in the Cyprus issue. Mr. Clark, who was responding to 
questions from correspondents after his meeting with President 
Kliridhis this afternoon, said that he discussed the whole issue 
with the president of the Republic and with some of Mr. 
Kliridhis' advisers. Despite the continuous and persistent 
questions from the correspondents, Mr. Clark refused to make any 
comment on the assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis. He also 
refused to comment on a letter addressed to him today by Greek 
Cypriot political correspondents. The letter noted that from 
now on they will not be visiting the occupied areas to cover the 
proximity talks for security reasons. 
  The question of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' assassination was 
also 
discussed by Joe Clark and Rauf Denktas at their meeting today. 
However, Joe Clark refrained from giving any details and said 
that it is a question of a human tragedy, making no reference 
whatsoever to the political dimensions of the issue.

<F P=106> [Report by Marios Papailia] </F>
  [Text] The next target of the Turkish Secret Services could 
be Dhimitrios Matafias, former National Guard Chief, who has 
been named repeatedly in press reports and special books 
published by writers cooperating with the Turkish agencies. 
  Correspondent Lazaros Mavros revealed this when he spoke for 
the Committee for Solidarity with Kurdistan at a news conference 
yesterday. Mavros added that the Greek security authorities 
have been notified regarding the issue. 
  Party leaders or representatives attended the news 
conference 
organized by the Committee for Solidarity with Kurdistan to 
denounce Yeoryiadhis' horrible murder and condemn the crime. 
They also said that a parliamentary delegation would visit the 
UN secretary general to denounce the continuing genocide of the 
Kurdish people and Yeoryiadhis' murder. 
  Dhimitrios Sillouris, secretary general of the DISI 
[Democratic Rally], said that with Yeoryiadhis' murder, the 
Turks were promoting their beliefs, which do not allow them to 
pursue the role of a peacekeeper in the former Yugoslavia. He 
also mentioned that the state must improve its security 
structure, adding that the murder will constitute the beginning 
of a more intense struggle by those who deal with human rights. 
  Stathis Kittis, secretary general of the DIKO [Democratic 
Party], stressed that Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' murder is 
undoubtedly the work of Turkish agents who showed in this way 
that the Turkish machine will stop at nothing. He added that 
this must concern those who deal with our national policy. 
Kittis said DIKO believes that we must all support everyone who 
fights for their freedom. 
  In his short address, Andreas Khristou, AKEL [Restorative 
Party of the Working People] spokesman, described Yeoryiadhis as 
responsible, a fighter, and an ideologist. He added that 
Yeoryiadhis gave his life when nationalism is growing and said 
we must do much, as a people and as a parliament. 
  Vasos Lissaridhis, EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] 
chairman, described the murder as a classic example of terrorism 
and an insult to dignity, freedom, and democracy. He said: 
Theofilos will go down in history as a man who realized the 
connection among people who share a common source of danger--the 
Turkish regime. 
  Yado Roz, European Kurdistan Movement representative, called 
upon the international common view to resist and condemn the 
murders of Kurdish figures and the Turkish regime. Theofilos' 
murder and the murders of other members of Kurdish organizations 
worldwide clearly show that Turkey insists on taking its dirty 
war abroad. 
  Lakis Pingouras, representing the Committee for Solidarity 
with Kurdistan, mentioned that the immediate goal is to try to 
get the Kurdish state recognized and to establish the 
committee's office here as the official voice of the Kurds in 
Cyprus.

  [Excerpts] The perpetrator of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' 
horrible murder was a professional hit man acting according to a 
careful plan for which he needed much accurate information. 
This is the result of the Criminal Investigation Department's 
investigations so far and it reinforces the belief that Turkey's 
secret agencies planned the murder some time ago. 
  The culprit used a semi-automatic gun or a small automatic 
gun using special technology. The Criminal Investigation 
Department is convinced that if the culprit has not escaped to 
the occupied areas, he could be located and arrested. But the 
hit man could have crossed the buffer zone five minutes after 
the murder. According to the same reports, the culprits could 
have escaped to the occupied areas even with a car. This 
afternoon, the police are expected to release the sketches of 
two people who were seen moving in a suspicious manner while 
riding in a yellow Mercedes a few hours before the murder. The 
description of one of the men matches eyewitness descriptions of 
the man they saw approach and shoot Theofilos from a Vespa 
motorcycle. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, 
Former 
National Guard Chief Dhimitrios Matafias confirmed that several 
Turkish press reports list him as a target of Turkey's secret 
services. Matafias reportedly met the Kurdish movement's 
leadership eight years ago and since then has supported the 
Kurds both financially and in other ways. 
  Commenting on information that he will be the next Turkish 
target, Matafias said he believes the Turks use these methods to 
intimidate or make an impression and thus strangle every voice 
in support of the Kurds. He added that he must take some 
additional protection measures.

  [Text] Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, the head of the Greek Cypriot 
Public Information Office [PIO] Turkish Department, was shot and 
killed outside his house at midnight last night. Yeoryiadhis, 
37, was fired on by two people on motorbikes. He was hit five 
times in various parts of his body, including his head, and he 
died on the spot. 
  Greek television network ET-1 and Greek Cypriot television 
networks Logos and Antenna dropped their regular programming to

officials were at the scene investigating the incident. 
  As well as heading the Greek Cypriot PIO Turkish Department, 
Yeoryiadhis chaired the Greek Cypriot Committee of Solidarity 
with Kurdistan. He had direct links with the terrorist Kurdish 
Workers Party [PKK]. He visited the PKK camps in the al-Biqa' 
valley on various occasions and coordinated the campaigns 
organized in south Cyprus to support the PKK. 
  Theofilos Yeoryiadhis was known as a fanatical enemy of the 
Turks.

  [Text] The troublesome Nevruz [spring and new year] holiday 
is being marked peacefully in southeastern Anatolia. Instead of 
burning fires in the streets, the people in the southeast 
preferred to mark Nevruz by staying at home. One of the rare 
Nevruz fires in Diyarbakir was lighted by Unal Erkan, the 
regional governor. Our correspondent Metin Corabatir reports on 
Nevruz celebrations in southeastern Anatolia. 
  [Begin Corabatir recording] The Nevruz holiday is being 
(?marked) without incident but also (?without enthusiasm) 
[brief break in transmission]. At present, the smoke from 
Nevruz fires is rising in various quarters of the city. The 
first Nevruz fires in Diyarbakir were lit in the outlying 
quarters in the morning. 
  The people were again caught in the middle as the government 
encouraged this year's Nevruz celebrations under specific 
conditions and the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] called on the 
people to mark it in their homes. That the people were caught 
in the middle was clear from the fact that instead of dancing 
around the few fires, the people closed their shops and stayed 
at home. 
  Unal Erkan exerted enormous effort to put his own cosmetic 
touch on Nevruz celebrations in Diyarbakir, where two PKK 
militants were killed in a morning attack on a hideout. He 
first visited the newspapers and informed them that the holiday 
was passing peacefully and without incident throughout the 
region. He then visited the central market accompanied by a 
large group of reporters. He shook hands and listened to 
people's problems. He then left for Sehitlik Street, which he 
described as his own street, and distributed candies to hundreds 
of children who surrounded him. He danced with them. The fire 
lighted by Erkan was one of the rare city fires around which 
people danced. [end recording]

  [Text] Nevruz was celebrated without incident in a wedding 
hall in Ankara. The slogan "Leader Apo [alias for Abdullah 
Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers Party, PKK]" was shouted 
at the Nevruz celebration organized by the Democracy Party [DEP]. 
  Party officials tried to suppress certain slogans and 
behavior. 
  [Begin correspondent Aydogan Kilinc recording] In response 
to 
the request by DEP's Ankara provincial organization to celebrate 
Nevruz, the Ankara governor allocated a wedding hall in Altindag. 
  Strict security measures were taken around the hall and 
those 
entering the premises were searched. The slogan "Resistance 
Means Existence," written in Turkish and Kurdish, drew the most 
attention. Many people wearing yellow, red, and green bands, 
the PKK's colors, made victory signs. 
  A young girl wrapped in these colors danced and excited the 
300-strong crowd and people started shouting extremist slogans. 
  When Imam Canpolat, leader of DEP's Ankara provincial 
organization, said that there is no middle path, which means 
surrender, the shouts of "Leader Apo" in Kurdish rose in the 
hall. 
  DEP deputy leader Remzi Kartal got angry when he heard this 
slogan and warned the gathering that Nevruz cannot be marked 
under such conditions. He called on the crowd to act in 
accordance with the DEP's program and principles. He reacted 
strongly when his advice was not heeded. Remzi Kartal said that 
efforts are under way to push his party, whose ouster from the 
parliament is being sought, outside the legitimate system. He 
said that all the laws in the country are being used to close 
down the DEP. He added that the sole objective of the DEP is to 
contribute to the democratic and political solution of the 
Kurdish issue, which has become the country's main problem. 
  The crowd in the hall booed Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's 
proposal that Nevruz be an official holiday. 
  The crowd then listened to songs in an attempt to calm 
itself 
and dispersed without incident. [end recording]

  [Text] Ankara--Reliable Kurdish sources in the Middle East 
reported this week that outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan 
(PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan had moved out of Syria and was 
currently in Lachin, a part of Azerbaijan which is currently 
under Armenian control and also inhabited by Kurds. 
  The sources said Ocalan had travelled to Lachin earlier this 
month from his residence in the town of al-Qardahah in Syria's 
Latakia province. The PKK leader had been living for nearly a 
decade in Damascus and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's hometown 
of al-Qardahah. 
  According to information received by the TDN, [TURKISH DAILY 
NEWS] Ocalan is currently in contact both with Armenian 
officials and influential Kurdish circles in Lachin. 
  They said that he aims to establish a major training base in 
the Lachin corridor, which connects Nagorno-Karabakh with 
Armenia, opened by the Armenians in 1992 and since then the main 
artery supplying the enclave from Armenia. 
  The exact date of Ocalan's travel to Lachin was not made 
clear, although it has been confirmed that he was outside Syria 
earlier this month when Iraqi Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani 
visited that country. 
  Despite Turkish press reports that Talabani had contacted 
Ocalan and was seeking to press him for a new cease-fire, 
sources said the PUK [Patriotic Union of Kurdistan] leader--who 
also travelled to al-Qardahah--did not find him there. Talabani 
has denied the reports saying he had no contact with Ocalan. In 
a meeting he held with Turkish gendarmerie commanders last week 
near the Iraqi border, Talabani informed Turkey of this as well. 
  The sources, who usually know of Ocalan's whereabouts, told 
the TDN on Thursday [17 March] that there was also speculation 
that the PKK leader had recently travelled to Russia. 
  Once the camp in Lachin is set up, they said, there could be 
more terrorist activity in eastern Turkey. 
  The PKK has in the past denied Ocalan's previous trips 
outside Syria. 
  The PKK's European representative and Ocalan's political 
advisor, Kani Yilmaz, said in January that he would even meet 
the press but no journalist has seen Ocalan for the past seven 
months.

  [Text] Ankara -- A ceasefire call over the weekend by 
Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the outlawed Workers Party of 
Kurdistan (PKK), has been dismissed by the Government on the 
grounds that it is no more than a "tactical move" which is "void 
of real content." The general reaction in Ankara to Ocalan's 
call has been that he is faced with serious difficulties on the 
military front and is trying to buy time for his organization 
before embarking on new attacks. 
  In a message sent on Sunday [13 March] to a two-day Kurdish 
Conference organized in Brussels, Ocalan, indicated that "they 
would be open to all recommendations for a settlement whether 
these came from the state or from international organizations." 
Ocalan, whose organization has been waging a bloody separatist 
war in Southeast Anatolia, claimed "they did not have an 
absolute aim of dividing Turkey." He added that "propaganda" 
attributing this aim to them "did not reflect their true policy." 
  "I want to indicate that we would be party to any solution 
which is based on the notion of dialogue with the Turkish State, 
and which takes into consideration in a democratic manner the 
legitimate demands of our people, and which aims at attaining 
results to this effect" Ocalan said. 
  He added that they had from the beginning of this dispute 
been open to proposals for a settlement, and said "from the 
beginning we were ready to discuss any alternative including 
that of federation on this basis." 
  Ocalan went on to declare that "in the event of a mutual 
ceasefire to be monitored by international observers they would 
not be the side complicating matters." 
  "I am announcing that in the event that the basis for a 
political solution and free political activities is prepared, we 
will open completely the path to ending the armed struggle" 
Ocalan said in his message read out to the conference by Kani 
Yilmaz, the representative in Europe of the ERNK, [National 
Liberation Front of Kurdistan] a PKK affiliated organization. 
  The response to Ocalan's message in Ankara was short and 
dismissive. Analysts point out that both President Suleyman 
Demirel's and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's reply to Ocalan's 
call was merely a repetition of a position held for years. 
Namely that "there can be no bargaining with terrorists," that 
"the roots of this terrorist organization will be wiped out" and 
that "they are only making this call for a ceasefire because 
they have been cornered." 
  Analysts also indicate that the timing of Ocalan's proposal 
for a ceasefire and a political solution makes it difficult for 
the Government to respond positively to this call. 
  They cite the fact that there is talk of a wide ranging 
military operation against the PKK planned for the coming days, 
and probably for immediately after the local elections on March 
27. They say this makes it more or less impossible for the 
government to even consider Ocalan's call. 
  Analysts also add that Ocalan's call itself "smacks of no 
more than a tactical move." They say this move appears to be 
planned to capitalize on the fact that Turkey is being cornered 
by the West following the lifting of the immunity of pro-Kurdish 
Democracy Party (DEP) deputies and their subsequent detention. 
Ocalan is clearly aiming to tighten the political screw on 
Turkey even further because he knows the Government in Ankara 
can not respond to his call in a positive manner. 
  There is also the view among analysts that Ocalan through 
this call of his is also signalling that he will be ordering an 
all-out attack in the coming days. 
  This view has it that Ocalan is opening the door to the 
argument that he has offered the hand of peace but that it was 
rebuffed by Turkey leaving him no choice but to fight on. There 
are also questions about whether there is any practicality to a 
ceasefire. 
  Especially when it is recalled that the PKK broke its 
unilaterally declared ceasefire last year by massacring unarmed 
soldiers in civilian garb hours after they had been discharged 
after completing their military service in the Southeast. 
  These questions mount when it is wondered how Ocalan can 
order an across-the-board ceasefire when it is known that there 
are large numbers of maverick elements within the PKK which 
looked on the previous ceasefire with great suspicion. 
  When it is considered that these elements are not after 
anything short of total Kurdish independence this also casts 
serious doubts on Ocalan's statement that they do not aim to 
divide Turkey and are basically after a political dialogue. As 
for the two-day Kurdish conference in Brussels held on Saturday 
and Sunday the common view to come out of this was that there 
was the need for a democratic solution to Turkey's Kurdish 
problem. 
  The majority of foreign speakers addressing the conference 
place the blame for the continuing war with the PKK on Turkey. 
Analysts say this probably acted as a catalyst in prompting 
Ocalan to appear conciliatory and open to a dialogue in his call 
for a ceasefire and a political settlement. 
  Despite these political overtures, though, analysts say the 
signs now are that the sides are preparing to draw their swords 
and are predicting more violence in the coming days.

<F P=106> [Article by Fikret Bila: "There Are Armed Forces Outside the </F>
Military"] 
  [Excerpts] Socialist Populist Party leader and Deputy Prime 
Minister Murat Karayalcin said that there are other armed forces 
outside the military, and these forces are getting their 
training outside the country, taking an oath to destroy the 
regime. Karayalcin, talking about his views on recent political 
developments, repeated that he was misunderstood when he said, 
"There are those who are preparing to intervene against 
democracy." Karayalcin, explaining he did not mean the word 
"coup" said, "When I mentioned there are those who are getting 
ready to intervene against democracy, I did not mean to say 
coups. I meant some particular forces. The methods of 
intervention are not the same any more. In less developed 
countries, because the military is the most powerful force, the 
military carries out coups. 
  ``However, this is changing. In a neighboring country, the 
name of which I don't want to mention, one industrialist, 
leasing tanks and soldiers, is able to intervene against the 
government. In Georgia, Shevardnadze can state that the ports 
of his country are in the hands of the Mafia. Those fighting in 
the former Yugoslavia are not soldiers. The traditional 
standards for coups are different now. In Turkey there are 
sectors arming themselves outside the military. There are 
people being trained outside the country and there are those 
taking an oath to change the regime. I wanted to draw attention 
to these people. It is not possible to govern Turkey without 
democracy. Turkey cannot be governed by military rule, 
isolating itself from the outside world. This is not possible.'' 
[passage omitted] 
  Karayalcin, emphasizing that Turkey is in a geographic 
region 
where the line between war and peace is very thin, said, "It is 
very easy to move from peace to war in the Middle East, in the 
Balkans, and in the Caucasus. For these regions peace in Turkey 
and in the area has great importance. We have to add `Peace at 
home, peace in the region' to our principle of `Peace at home, 
peace in the world.' Taking regional characteristics into 
consideration, a thesis was put forth recently which says 
`Turkey does not have to be an ordinary country in the region.' 
According to this thesis, Turkey will be either a strong 
country or it will be divided. This is a hypothesis worth 
thinking about. It is from this perspective that one can 
evaluate Turkey's decision, despite the fact that all its 
governments have created inflation and dollar dependency, to 
choose a nonnegotiable 7-percent growth rate and to achieve that 
goal without fear of going into foreign debt."[passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Okan Muderrisoglu: "The Treasury Used All Its </F>
Resources"] 
  [Text] The Treasury used all its resources from January to 
mid-March 1994. The payment of wages and salaries before the 
religious festival and the repayment of part of Turkey's 
internal debts yesterday have left the Treasury without funds. 
  The Treasury has drawn and used 122.5 trillion Turkish lira 
in the form of an advance from the Central Bank. That amount 
was the maximum it could draw from the Central Bank. It is now 
eagerly awaiting tax revenues to pay the workers and civil 
servants. 
  The Central Bank and the public sector banks have moved to 
attract funds following the religious festival. Ziraat Bankasi 
[the Agricultural Bank] has taken measures to attract funds 
through high interest rates so as to meet its hard currency 
needs. Emlak Bankasi [the Property Bank], Halkbank [the Popular 
Bank], and Vakifbank [the Endowment Bank] have taken similar 
measures. 
  The Treasury paid 16.5 trillion Turkish lira in wages and 
salaries on 11 March by using funds from the Central Bank. It 
repaid part of its debts yesterday by using the foreign currency 
it has in its accounts with the Central Bank. 
  In a statement to SABAH, a high-ranking Treasury official 
said the Treasury's accounts will be in the "red" if the 
expected increase in tax revenues does not occur. Stressing 
that a very large part of the foreign currency acquired from 
Japan cannot be allocated for the payment of internal debts, the 
official asserted: "Some $725 million has been acquired from 
Japan. Of that, $225 million has been used to repay foreign 
debts. The remaining amount has not been touched. It has been 
added to Turkey's official reserves. But it is in the 
Treasury's accounts. The Treasury must transfer that resource 
to the Central Bank if the Central Bank moves to intervene in 
the money markets. We have not done so. That resource belongs 
to the Treasury. We have transferred a very limited amount from 
it for the payments that were effected yesterday. The amount 
allocated for the purpose was the maximum that could be 
transferred. The remaining amount is earmarked for Turkey's 
external obligations."

<F P=106> [Article by Osman Ulagay: "`Ciller Risk' Depresses Turkish </F>
Lira" 
  [Text] Turkey is a country of opportunities, a 
country that likes to take risks, a country of desperate people. 
Only in such a country would Tansu Ciller, without even minimal 
administrative experience, have the chance to become prime 
minister. 
  Making Mrs. Ciller prime minister was a very risky 
investment. As in all risky investments, those who hoped to be 
the big winners were the ones who portrayed Ciller as the 
"savior." 
  Unfortunately, these hopes were not realized. Quite the 
opposite, Turkey has become a country where the risks of Mrs. 
Ciller's administration are steadily growing. Actually, the 
collapse of the Turkish lira and spiraling interest are the 
results of this growing risk. 
  At the point where we are now, the risk of continuing with 
Mrs. Ciller and this government increases every day and is 
reflected in the marketplace. It seems nearly impossible to 
eliminate this risk and turn this negative course around. 
  Even those in the business world and finance sector where 
almost everyone has lost morale, who were laid back just two 
months ago, saying, "Oh, really, is the country going under 
again?" are now frowning and worrying, "Where are we going, how 
are going to get out of this mess?" 
  Various solutions are being proposed in seeking an answer to 
this question. For example, many agree that the only way out of 
the impasse in the economy and financial markets is through a 
medium-term program. The following are the major conditions 
necessary for such a program to be successful: 

  -  This program 
would be based on as widespread as possible a social compromise, 
or consensus. 
  -  A well-informed and experienced team would prepare 
this program. 
  -  A government that would not be frightened by daily 
problems into swerving from the program and that would be 
determined not to make concessions would implement this 
program. 
  -  The government would be fully trusted to carry out the 
program. 
  Now let us think sincerely: Which of the conditions 
necessary 
to prepare and implement such a program can the Ciller 
government fulfill? 
  Can this government, which cannot even reach consensus on an 
Ataturk rally, be expected to reach a consensus on a 
stabilization program requiring the fair distribution of heavy 
obligations? 
  Mrs. Ciller has no one in her stable who is knowledgeable 
and 
experienced. 
  Recently, Mrs. Ciller has pursued only those things oriented 
to saving the day and earning her political points. She is 
trying to use the state-owned banks in a way that totally 
violates the concept of a stabilization program. 
  No one trusts the Ciller government anymore. Mrs. Ciller, 
who 
is at the point of not knowing what to do, is believed to be 
under the influence of various interests and circles. 
  Every measure this government would take would, in this 
climate, be met with suspicion and everyone would ask, "Who is 
it for?" 
  In a climate in which "devaluation" and "consolidation" are 
on the agenda, everyone seeks ways to escape the calamity. 
  The concern that Mrs. Ciller may take on new adventures at 
home or abroad feeds the climate of instability. 
  In short, the "Ciller risk" is preventing a solution and 
devaluing the Turkish lira.

  [Text] Ankara (CUMHURIYET BUREAU) -- SHP [Social Democratic 
Populist Party] General Chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Murat 
Karayalcin stressed that "for domestic and foreign loan 
requirements to be this high is a grave" situation. Karayalcin 
said, "What is graver, however, is for the Turkish economy to 
enter the process of becoming based on the dollar, for the 
Turkish lira to lose respect and cease to be a reliable medium 
of exchange." Noting that the preservation of national 
sovereignty is closely linked to reliability of the Turkish 
lira, Karayalcin proposed that urgent measures be started for 
Central Bank autonomy. The SHP leader said that the excessive 
dependence on domestic and foreign loans makes it impossible to 
produce an alternative policy in the short term. 
  Murat Karayalcin, speaking in his party's TBMM [Turkish 
Grand 
National Assembly] group meeting yesterday, evaluated recent 
economic developments. Karayalcin, whose criticism drew 
attention, said that he was "worried" that the economy's 
dependence on domestic and foreign loans would eventually create 
important problems from the standpoint of exercising sovereignty 
rights. Karayalcin, stressing that we are "gradually becoming a 
nonproductive, but consumer society, said the following: 
  ``The savings rate in 1993 was a marginal 15.3 percent. This 
is an incredibly low level. A country that has a marginal 
savings rate of 15 percent cannot finance its own development. 
For domestic and foreign loan dependency to be this extensive 
makes it impossible to produce alternative policies in the short 
term. Some measures have been taken. But we will not feel the 
effect of the Taxation Law until after 1995. We hope the public 
sector's loan requirements can be reduced by 1995. Certainly we 
have to increase domestic savings to reduce the economy's dollar 
dependency.'' 
  Noting that Turkey largely lost in the 1950s the savings 
structure of society of the 1930-40's, Karayalcin said, "We must 
concentrate in the 1990's on measures to base growth largely on 
domestic resources." 
<H5>  Status of Turkish Lira `Grave' </H5>
  Karayalcin stressed that for domestic and foreign loan 
requirements to be this high was "grave" and continued: 
  "However, what is graver is for the Turkish economy to enter 
the process of becoming based on the dollar. For the Turkish 
lira to lose respect and cease to be a reliable medium of 
exchange is a more serious problem that high domestic and 
foreign loans. There is a question of an approach of indexing 
rental contracts and commodity prices to the dollar. And even 
more serious is that our citizens have begun to use foreign 
currency as a savings medium. The SHP considers our national 
currency's loss of value and respect an extremely negative 
development. The preservation of national sovereignty, as well 
as other elements, is closely linked to reliability of the 
Turkish lira. It is impossible as a whole to speak of the 
Turkish lira's gaining respect, or of fully exercising national 
sovereignty rights. The problem is not just to preserve the 
economic balances, but that our national currency gain respect 
at the same time." 
  Karayalcin said that efforts toward Central Bank autonomy 
must begin urgently. Stressing that there is an inverse 
relationship between an autonomous Central Bank and inflation, 
Karayalcin said, "The Central Bank must, within a reasonable 
period of time, cease to be a body that serves the Treasury 
alone and become autonomous. Autonomy, on which agreement must 
be reached in the next few years and which would be implemented 
at a time that would not put a squeeze on the economy, is 
important from the standpoint of the European Union also."

<F P=106> [Interview with "Just Order" cofounder Suleyman Karagulle by </F>
Rusen Cakir via FAX from Bishkek; date not given: "What Erbakan 
Is Doing Is Not Just Order"] 
  [Text] Along with increased votes for the Prosperity Party 
[RP] has also come the party's "Just Order." Suleyman Karagulle, 
who made a significant contribution to creation of the project, 
does not believe that the RP and Necmettin Erbakan are sincere 
about the "Just Order." Karagulle lives in the Kyrgyzstan 
capital, Bishkek, and answered our questions by FAX. 
  [Cakir] Is the "Just Order" platform that Necmettin Erbakan 
proposed the same as the one you developed? 
  [Karagulle] Erbakan and I worked together on the "Just 
Order." We agreed on almost all of the sentences. We had no 
disagreements except for one or two matters. Nevertheless, 
phrases were changed over time. Meanings change even if the 
words do not. Different things can be understood by the same 
words. You understand this only in practice. I cannot say 
anything because we have not seen it in practice. 
  [Cakir] You said on the news that the RP considered the 
"Just 
Order" a means of propaganda and did not intend to implement it. 
Do you still feel this way? 
  [Karagulle] I said that the project had nothing to do with 
the RP platform, that the RP had done no preparation for it, and 
that it has talked about it rather than implement it. This talk 
may be only to win votes. You must ask them, not me, what 
happens next. I am forced to make this statement because they 
have the power, but are not doing anything. They are better at 
implementing the existing order. This prompts hesitation about 
the Just Order. I want to tell people again and again that what 
Erbakan is saying is true, but what he is doing is not the Just 
Order. 
  It does Erbakan no harm for me to say this. The Just Order 
has opponents within the RP, and it is Erbakan's job to win them 
over. Moreover, the West also fears the Just Order. If they 
would learn the facts, they would not be so opposed. 
  The RP may be angry at me, but they are always angry at me 
anyway. 
  [Cakir] What do you think will happen if the RP wins the 
election? 
  [Karagulle] Nothing will happen if the RP wins. The other 
parties will tighten up at the table and give the RP room. They 
cannot solve problems with this logic, and today's hard times 
will continue and grow worse. A single party cannot solve 
Turkey's problems, but the Just Order can. 
  There is no majority system under the Just Order, but a 
national coalition. It is an order that recognizes the rights of 
one sheep as well as the other 99. The RP is saying "Just 
Order," but is chasing after a majority system. And it will take 
advantage of the tyranny of the order. This is what will happen, 
but they are the "false dawn" (false enlightenment). True 
believers in the just order will come after them, and they will 
save humanity.

<F P=106> [IAEA "Press Release -- for use of information media -- not </F>
an official record": "IAEA Board of Governors Holds Meeting on 
Inspections in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)"] 
  [Text] The Board of Governors of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] held a meeting on March 21 to consider the 
situation arising from the prevention by the DPRK, during an 
IAEA inspection visit to the DPRK March 1-15, 1994, of 
activities to verify whether nuclear material had been diverted 
since the Agency's last inspection in 1993. 
  Following its discussion, the Board adopted a resolution, 
inter alia expressing its grave concern, finding the DPRK in 
further non-compliance with its Safeguards Agreement; calling 
upon the DPRK immediately to allow the IAEA to complete all 
required inspection activities and to comply fully with its 
Safeguards Agreement; and requesting the Director General to 
transmit the resolution and his report to the Security Council 
and General Assembly of the United Nations. 
  The full text of the Board's resolution, as adopted, is 
attached: 
  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR THE APPLICATION OF 
SAFEGUARDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TREATY ON THE 
NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS (INFCIRC/403) 
THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS, 
  (a) RECALLING the Board of Governors' resolutions GOV/2636 
of 25 February 1993, GOV/2639 of 19 March 1993, GOV/2692 of 23 
September 1993, the General Conference's resolution GC 
(XXXVII)/RES/624 of 1 October 1993, and in particular, GOV/2645 
of 1 April 1993, which found the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) to be in non-compliance with its safeguards 
agreement (INFCIRC/403) and referred the matter to the Security 
Council of the United Nations, 
  (b) RECALLING ALSO resolution 825 (1993) adopted by the 
Security Council of the United Nations on 11 May 1993, which, 
INTER ALIA, requested the Director General to report on this 
matter to the Security Council, 
  (c) NOTING the Director General's written and oral reports 
of 21 March 1994 and GOV/2687/ADD.4 in which he stated that the 
Agency inspection team was not allowed to conduct indispensable 
and agreed inspection activities at the DPRK radiochemical 
laboratory, and that the Agency is unable to draw conclusions as 
to whether there has been either diversion of nuclear material 
or reprocessing at the radiochemical laboratory since February 
1993, 
  (d) NOTING FURTHER the Director General's reaffirmation that 
the Secretariat remains available to perform inspection 
activities in the DPRK in accordance with its procedures and 
agreements, and 
  (e) TAKING ACCOUNT of the fact that the DPRK is a party to 
the NPT and is bound by its safeguards commitments; 
  1. EXPRESSES grave concern that the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea has failed to implement essential elements of 
resolutions of the Board and the General Conference concerning 
its non- compliance with its safeguards agreement (INFCIRC/403); 
  2. FINDS that the DPRK is in further non-compliance with its 
safeguards agreement, has aggravated this situation by not 
allowing IAEA inspectors to conduct indispensable inspection 
activities and that the Agency consequently remains unable to 
verify that there has been no diversion of nuclear material 
required to be safeguarded under the terms of the safeguards 
agreement to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; 
  3. STRONGLY ENDORSES and commends the patient and impartial 
efforts of the Director General and the Secretariat to implement 
the safeguards agreement; 
  4. REGRETS the stalement in the Agency's efforts to resolve 
the DPRK safeguards issue, as requested by the Security Council 
of the United Nations, due to the lack of cooperation of the 
DPRK; 
  5. CALLS UPON the DPRK immediately to allow the IAEA to 
complete all requested inspection activities and to comply fully 
with its safeguards agreement; 
  6. REQUESTS the Director General to transmit this resolution 
and his report to all members of the Agency and to the Security 
Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations in 
accordance with Article XII.C. of the Statute; and 
  7. REMAINS SEIZED of the matter and REQUESTS the Director 
General to report back to the Board any significant developments 
at its next meeting when it will consider, if necessary, further 
measures in accordance with Article XII.C. of the Statute.

  [Text] Brussels, March 22 (AFP) -- British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd said here Tuesday [22 March] that he was 
not hopeful of an early agreement in a row over voting rules 
which is blocking enlargement of the EU [European Union]. 
  Speaking as he arrived for an urgent meeting of EU foreign 
ministers on the issue, he said: "I'm not very hopeful of 
reaching an answer today." 
  But Hurd insisted that Britain had no intention of 
jeopardising the enlargement of the EU to take in Austria, 
Finland, Norway and Sweden. 
  Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos was 
holding separate meetings with Hurd and Spanish Foreign Minister 
Javier Solana just ahead of Tuesday's meeting, the fourth in so 
many weeks to grapple with the issue. 
  Spain is backing the British position that the enlargement 
of 
the EU should not dilute the power of the Union's bigger 
countries to block decisions they do not like. 
  The rest of the 12-nation Union want the threshhold of 
blocking majorities raised from 23 votes out of 76 to 27 out of 
90 to take account of the incoming members. But this would 
weaken the ability of the EU's bigger countries to block 
controversial decisions. 
  The issue has caused a deep split in the EU, with most of 
its 
members accusing Britain and Spain of wanting to cripple the 
Union's decision-making ability. 
  The four applicants, who completed their negotiations to 
join 
the EU earlier this month, cannot enter until the issue is 
resolved. 
  Hurd said no compromises so far advanced were satisfactory 
to 
Britain. "We intend to work until we get satisfaction," he said. 
  Failure to reach a decision this month could make it 
impossible for the four countries to join the EU on schedule on 
January 1, and could also dampen the enthusiasm of their 
electorates to endorse membership.

<F P=106> [Julius Lorincz report on "recent" news conference in Vienna </F>
with Austrian President Thomas Klestil: "Our Region Has a 
Tremendous Future" -- first paragraph is editorial introduction] 
  [Text] Thomas Klestil, President of the Republic of 
Austria, recently received a group of Slovak reporters -- from 
NARODNA OBRODA, PRACA, SLOVENSKY DENNIK, UJ SZO, SLOBODNY PIATOK 
weekly, and PRAVDA. The reason for this meeting in his study at 
the Vienna Hofburg was the upcoming visit by the Slovak 
president to Austria. Although in the meantime domestic events 
in Slovakia resulted in a postponement of the visit, the 
frankness and stimulating nature of the discussion with Klestil 
undoubtedly warrant our passing on some of the ideas and views 
of the Austrian president. 
  By way of introduction, he pointed out that Austria has for 
decades endeavored to remove the Iron Curtain, to create the 
conditions for good neighborly relations despite the diversity 
of ideological views. "Austria was like a window, but the Iron 
Curtain is gone, and we are very close neighbors capable of 
extensive cooperation. There are no two capitals as close to 
one another as Vienna and Bratislava. Moreover, as I study our 
relations on a daily basis and in the long-term perspective, I 
believe that this region has a tremendous future. You know that 
at this time we are having problems concerning the transit of 
automobile transport through Austria, and we are also discussing 
it with the European Union. We have, however, the great option 
of transferring the transport not only to the railroad but also 
to the Danube River. After all, there is the Rhine-Main-Danube 
Channel, there soon may be also a Danube-Oder channel, and if 
some facilities are added, Vienna and Bratislava can become 
important reloading centers. There are great possibilities for 
an important power center to emerge in our region -- oil and gas 
pipelines from Russia pass through here, and the Adria oil 
pipeline. I am also thinking of cooperation between Vienna and 
Bratislava airports, of the entire infrastructure of the two 
great cities." 
  In the subsequent part of the discussion, Klestil pointed 
out 
that the "rosy picture" of the proximity of Vienna and 
Bratislava is not enough for Austrian-Slovak relations -- 
cooperation incorporates the situation of the two states in its 
entirety and, in this context, he acknowledged that Austria is 
the "number one" foreigner in founding joint firms and various 
forms of joint ventures in Slovakia. 
  A lot of the discussion was dedicated to Central Europe and 
relations in this part of the continent. According to Klestil, 
Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia are 
interesting neighbors who are undergoing the transition to 
democratic states with a market economy: "Do you know that in 
the last few days, we have progressed on the road towards the 
European Union, and the firmer embedded we are there, the better 
we will be able to optimize your being our neighbors. We are in 
a certain sense merging again. No, I do not mean to be nostalgic 
about history -- I am a republican and a democrat -- but when I 
sit here in the room that once belonged to Josef II, and next to 
it is Maria Theresia's room -- it is only natural to perceive 
the bonds of Central Europe. The unnatural borders have 
disappeared, old possibilities have been revived and new 
possibilities of cooperation have been created." 
  The Austrian president continued in these reflections when 
the conversation turned to the meeting in Litomysl [eastern 
Bohemia] of the presidents of the Central European countries 
planned for April at the instigation of President Havel: "We 
should discuss there what Central Europe is, what our 
cooperation should be like, and political developments in this 
region. Yes, we should talk about the use of nuclear power, 
which is a very sensitive and aggravating issue for Austria. We 
have problems with the Czech Republic because of Temelin 
[nuclear power plant under construction], we are afraid of 
Jaslovske Bohunice and Mochovce [Slovak nuclear power plants]. 
You know, years ago, we decided in Austria -- I did not support 
this view then -- not to manufacture nuclear power. It must be 
understood that we expect Slovakia and other states to respect 
the population on the other side of the border -- a radioactive 
cloud such as Chernobyl's cannot be stopped by borders. Hence, 
the dangerous consequences of a conceivable nuclear accident has 
nothing to do with state sovereignty and borders." 
  The discussion also touched upon Austrian neutrality and 
its present meaning. Thomas Klestil said: "When I entered the 
presidential election campaign, I brought up the question of 
neutrality for a public discussion. Some of my advisers asked 
me then with consternation whether I was giving up hope of being 
elected. I declared, however, that neutrality is not a goal in 
itself, that it is a matter of security and guarantees. The 
security issue no longer has just a military dimension, it does 
not mean only protection against a military threat. In today's 
world, the threats have changed -- there are floods of refugees, 
migration flows, organized crime, drugs, nuclear accidents, and 
polluted environment. It was demonstrated that the public is 
ready for a down-to-earth discussion about these issues and is 
willing to accept a reasonable explanation. We succeeded in 
getting Austrians to accept Austria's joining the European Union 
in accordance with the law on neutrality. It states that we 
would not join any military grouping or agree to having foreign 
units enter our territory. So, Austria moves towards the 
European Union as a neutral state and it is not causing any 
problems here or in Brussels. I am glad it is so." 
  Klestil favorably commented on Slovakia joining the Council 
of Europe, and in this context he spoke also about the problems 
surrounding the Hungarian ethnic minority, about the anxiety in 
Slovakia resulting from a statement made once by the deceased 
Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall that he regards himself 
as the "spiritual prime minister of all 15 million Hungarians," 
i.e., including the more than 5 million Hungarians living 
abroad. He recommended that a reasonable basis be found for 
talks on these questions, that mistrust and concerns be 
gradually overcome, and said that it would be good to view these 
issues in a long-term perspective: "If we consider Europe 
democratic and liberal, borders in their present antiquated form 
have no meaning." We have observed that such a vision is nice 
and attractive but, unfortunately, at present we still keep 
encountering the tendency toward barriers, which is tied to the 
fears of an advanced and well-to-do Europe that millions of 
people will "sit on their travel bags" and contemplate whether 
it would not be best to leave their country in search of a more 
stable and better life. The Austrian president responded to 
this, among other things, with the following: 
  "The question of mass migration is a significant part of the 
threat presented by today's world. The prosperous countries of 
Europe must offer other countries the hope and prospects of a 
good future so that the local population decides to stay at 
home. Austria is helping refugees. Those coming from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are a real problem for us -- there are 74,000 
of them in Austria officially. We have no idea how many are 
there illegally. Just in Vienna, 8,000 children from Bosnia are 
attending school. What to do about these people? Will they 
integrate into our society? 
  ``The West undoubtedly must offer more rapid and efficient 
help-- the best help seems to be efficient cooperation and 
investments -- to the countries that are passing through a 
complex transformation process, so that their citizens find 
meaning for their existence and future.''

  [Text] The Tanaiste has said Sinn Fein can't be involved in 
roundtable talks on the future of the north until there's a 
permanent cessation of violence. 
  Speaking in Dublin following talks with the British Foreign 
Secretary Mr. Hurd, Mr. Spring also said there are no 
indications that the IRA is considering a temporary cease-fire. 
Derek Cunningham reports: 
  [Begin Cunningham recording] Mr. Hurd arrived at Iveagh 
House 
in the company of the Tanaiste at around half past ten this 
morning. The two men spent about an hour together and discussed 
a wide range of topics, including the present state of the peace 
process and the controversy over the enlargement of the European 
Union. 
  After the meeting, Mr. Spring said that--in relation to 
comments attributed to him at the weekend concerning an IRA 
cease-fire--there were no indications that the IRA are 
considering such a move. He said a temporary cease-fire would 
be welcomed by the communities in the north and would be 
encouraged by the government, but Mr. Spring said it was 
difficult to accept peace messages from Sinn Fein by day while 
mortar attacks like those on Heathrow Airport and Crossmaglen 
continued. 
  The British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the Downing 
Street Declaration was not a bargaining ploy but a robust 
statement of principle by the two governments. 
  Mr. Spring will accompany Mr. Hurd on a visit to Newgrange 
later this afternoon. Derek Cunningham RTE news, Iveagh House.

General"] 
  [Text] Bonn's desire to open a German consulate general as 
soon as possible in Kaliningrad, the former Koenigsberg, meets 
with increasingly determined objections in Moscow. Upon the 
instigation by Foreign Minister Kozyrev, the issue was passed on 
to the Russian Security Council at the beginning of this month. 
Kozyrev recommends putting the Germans off for an indefinite 
period, even if this were to cause the Russians' desired project 
of a consulate general in Frankfurt/Main to fail. He wants to 
talk to his Bonn counterpart, Kinkel, who is visiting Moscow 
this week, in this spirit and warn against a relapse "into the 
Germanic urge to the east": In particular, the debate about 
Koenigsberg, which was started in the European Parliament upon 
the suggestion of German deputies, and the demand for a "special 
relationship" between the European Union and the Kaliningrad 
area are "pure impudence."

ceremony for the Russian troops in August. The Chancellor's 
Office announced that a farewell for the Western Allies will 
also take place in Berlin in September "with high-level 
participation." 
  Butz stated that the talks among the four victorious powers 
have nearly been completed. Agreement has been reached on the 
basic issues. There are plans to organize an outstanding 
farewell ceremony with a tattoo by the Bundeswehr and with the 
participation of the armed forces of the Western Allies.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 21 Mar -- The Federal Government 
will continue to support the Germans in Romania and help them, 
particularly in the social, cultural, and agricultural spheres. 
This was announced by Mr. Waffenschmidt (Christian Democratic 
Union), the Federal Government's resettlers' commissioner, on 
Monday [21 March] after a talk with Bishop Christoph Klein, head 
of the Evangelical Church in Transylvania. In 1994, too, Bonn 
keeps financial aid available to support the Romanian Germans. 
For this year and for the past year 28 million German marks has 
been allocated for this purpose from the FRG Interior Ministry 
budget. This year a center for the elderly will be completed in 
Hermannstadt, Transylvania, and a cultural center in Temeschburg 
(Temesvar) in the Banat region. Waffenschmidt, parliamentary 
state secretary to the Interior Ministry, wants to visit the 
ethnic Germans in Romania in May. He added that a considerable 
minority of the Romanian Germans want to stay in their homeland. 
The approximately 20,000 applications for resettlement that the 
Federal Administrative Office still has are to be speedily 
processed within the framework of the regulations of the Law on 
Compensation for War-Induced Losses, Waffenschmidt concluded.

delegation attending the 91st session of the Interparliamentary 
Union [IPU] inaugurated here today has urged the conferees to 
debate the embargo clamped on Iraq and recommend a lifting of 
the embargo, particularly since Iraq has fulfilled its 
commitments toward the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. 
  The National Assembly delegation headed by Assembly Speaker 
Sa'di Mahdi Salih demanded that this issue be added to the 
agenda of the IPU conference, which was opened by French 
President Francois Mitterrand earlier today. 
  The correspondent of the Iraqi News Agency in Paris said 
that 
the parliamentary delegations attending the conference, 
representing 125 countries, will discuss the Iraqi proposal and 
make a decision on it. 
  The week-long conference will discuss the means of averting 
international conflicts; the United Nations' peacekeeping role; 
protecting the environment; the international political, 
economic, and social situation; and the possible drafting of a 
plan to remedy inequality between men and women in politics.

  [Excerpts] President Soares is in Brazil. He does not tire 
of advocating a good relationship between all peoples of the 
Lusophone countries, and he backs the community being prepared. 
Among other advantages, it will carry a significant weight at 
the UN, which could help many people in the future. These were 
Soares' words in an exclusive interview with Renascenca. Ines 
Saldanha also spoke to President Soares about the political 
contacts he has been having and of Itamar Franco's visit to 
Portugal. 
  [Begin recording] [Soares] First of all, at the invitation 
of 
Vice President Itamar Franco, we are preparing a major meeting 
to be held in Lisbon and a major meeting of Lusophone countries 
at a head-of-state level. [passage omitted] 
  [Saldanha] You place great importance on the July meeting of 
Lusophone countries, and I know that that is related to the 
importance you give to a greater weight of those countries in 
the UN. Do you think that could help Portugal in matters such 
as Indonesia? 
  [Soares] Of course. They all have come out, and even Brazil 
recently came out very clearly in favor of East Timor and in 
favor of its self-determination. This carries some weight. But 
I am thinking beyond the present. I am thinking of the future. 
  [Saldanha] Are you thinking of the community of Lusophone 
countries the Brazilian ambassador talks of? 
  [Soares] Exactly. I am thinking of a community, a 
Luso-Afro-Brazilian community that could have an important 
specific weight in the 21st century. 
  [Saldanha] And do you think that is viable considering the 
conditions in Mozambique and Angola? 
  [Soares] Precisely, what I want is a joint plan by Portugal 
and Brazil to help our African brothers, who are in a bad

  [Saldanha] Have you invited President Itamar to visit 
Portugal before the end of your mandate? 
  [Soares] Naturally, it has been confirmed that he will visit 
in June. Before the summit of heads of state, he will come on a 
bilateral state visit to Portugal, and I will have the honor of 
receiving him in Lisbon. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup by Annelise </F>
Bistrup; place and date not given: "The Minister Who Came In to 
the Heat"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup is cautiously 
optimistic after this week as peace seems to be in sight in the 
Balkans. He is happy about the changing of the guard in Danish 
foreign policy that clearly has made defense matters popular. 
  The days are gone when he had to be introduced as Per and 
Grete Haekkerup's oldest son. 
  Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup has come into his own. 
Admittedly he does not have his parent's outgoing charm; he is 
even somewhat shy, but on the other hand he has turned out to be 
one of the Nyrup government's best cards. 
  Along with Minister of Justice Erling Olsen, he ranks as one 
of the government's best ministers from the nonsocialist 
opposition, maybe even the [best] defense minister a 
nonsocialist government could hope for. 
  "That is very nice of them," Haekkerup says. "But that is 
also the kind of compliment one would rather do without." 
  The 48-year-old, a bachelor of polital science, who studied 
Russian during the six years he served in the military -- "no, 
that does not make me a spy" -- is at present, "after the most 
stressful year of my life," reading John Le Carre's romantic 
thriller The Night Porter, which deals with defining 
the bad guys after the fall of the wall. 
  As for himself, he can tell the exact moment when he 
realized 
that the time of the villains is not over: "The action of the 
Serbs when they started the bombing of Dubrovnik was what 
convinced me that the war in Bosnia was not about people simply 
trying to make life secure for themselves. I know the city, and 
it is an extremely beautiful city, but there is absolutely no 
military reason for bombing it. The line had been crossed where 
one could [meaningfully] talk about an element of self defense. 
Then came ethnic cleansing, the camps, and the gross violations 
of human rights." 
  [Haekkerup] Had we not lived through the World War II, one 
would not believe that such things could happen in Europe in our 
time. What we have seen in the former Yugoslavia is the worst 
since the Nazis broke through the thin layer of civilization. 
<H5>  It Can Still Go Wrong </H5>
  That is why Haekkerup is only "cautiously optimistic" after 
a 
week in which peace may be coming closer in the Balkans. The 
Serbs have withdrawn their heavy weapons from Sarajevo; Yeltsin 
has invited [the parties] to a peace conference; a rather 
fragile armistice has been established between Croats and 
Muslims in Bosnia. And finally the 10 Danish Leopard tanks 
reached Tuzla. 
  [Bistrup] To good to be true? 
  [Haekkerup] Yes, after everything we have seen we are of 
course somewhat skeptical. But I am still more optimistic today 
than I have been in the last nine months. This might be a 
decisive turning point in the war. That depends on our own will 
to persevere in a positive development. I cannot predict when we 
will have 100-percent peace in the Balkans. I think that this 
will remain a corner of unrest in Europe, and that we have to 
live with conflicts and ethnic tension in this region. 
  Just now the pendulum is swinging the right way. But if 
events move in another direction, there is the risk that the 
conflict will spread to Kosovo, Macedonia and possibly Albania. 
I do not think that possibility can be excluded. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  Haekkerup also thinks that we must live with the fact that 
nobody emerges as a winner in the Balkans: 
  [Haekkerup] Several hundred thousand people are dead, and 
the 
only thing the UN has been able to do is to try to limit the 
losses. That is what is so difficult about the UN mission in the 
former Yugoslavia; the fact that one does not emerge with great 
and impressive results. I still think that even though it is 
involved, risky, and complicated, the UN has made a clear 
difference. But we still have a long way to go. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  He can also live with the fact that it was the Russians who 
made it easier for the Serbs to meet the UN's demand to withdraw 
from Sarajevo before NATO's ultimatum expired: 
  [Haekkerup] Russia is an important participant no matter 
which conflict we are talking about. The Russian democrats, who 
are in the minority in the Duma, have a great need to feel and 
show that they are a part of our world order and that they also 
will be recognized as such. There is a risk involved if one acts 
for only one of the parties. But that is not only a Russian 
problem. The necessary political will to agree has been missing 
among the large Western powers and it took so long to find a 
common attitude because we, historically and culturally, have 
felt closer ties to one of the parties in the conflict than we 
have to the other. 
<H5>  A Bad Signal </H5>
  [Bistrup] Is it not a shame and a disgrace both for the EU 
[European Union], NATO, and the UN that so many should die 
before one could pull oneself together and do what should have 
been done a long time ago? 
  [Haekkerup] The conflict could have been limited, but maybe 
not stopped, at an earlier time if the will to behave in unison 
and apply the necessary means had been present. 
  But NATO's secretary general must once in a while point out 
the fact that it was not NATO, the EU, or the UN that started 
the war. It is a conflict which the different factions have 
inflicted upon each other. The truth of the matter is that the 
war is being continued by fairly small groups. But they are the 
ones that are armed. There are many bandits, but there are also 
some who fight, or have fought, for some ideas, some ideals. 
  The problem is that political and economic power has been 
transferred to military factions lead by single individuals, 
generals, or whatever we should call them. It is a different 
political culture with different rules from those in our part of 
the world. 
  [Bistrup] But the world society's hesitation has also 
revealed that crime pays. 
  [Haekkerup] An incredibly bad signal has been sent in that 
it 
has been proven that he who seizes a weapon will be rewarded; 
that he who conquers land will be in a stronger position at the 
negotiating table regardless of which human rights he has 
violated. And that signal has been sent. 
  We have also learned that the longer a conflict is allowed 
to 
continue, the more costly it will be to stop it. The longer one 
waits, the higher the price. The UN became involved in Macedonia 
at a relatively early stage when they sent in soldiers for 
preventative reasons. That prevented, at least at first, the 
conflict from spreading. 
  [Bistrup] Have we also learned that the threat of sanctions 
is an empty one? 
  [Haekkerup] Sanctions are still an important measure, but 
they are also a very simplistic measure. At first it is 
bloodless compared to sending in troops, but in the long run 
sanctions might have "bloody" results. 
  I was in Belgrade between Christmas and New Year's, and even 
though there was a steady stream of cars on the street, it was 
obvious that the sanctions were having an effect. More than half 
of Serb industry had been destroyed, unemployment was sky-high 
and inflation was raging. 
  I think that Serbia in the long run will pay a very high 
price for this. Even at the time when sanctions are lifted, 
there will be a reluctance on the part of the rest of the world 
to help them get going again. 
<H5>  New Danish Reality </H5>
  Haekkerup has taken into consideration the fact that he is 
politically and morally responsible for the possibility that 
Danish soldiers might have been hit in retaliatory actions if 
NATO had undertaken air strikes against the Serbs; the fact that 
it would be he who would receive the coffins. 
  [Haekkerup] Yes, there is some risk still present even 
though 
we have tried to ensure the safety of Danish soldiers as much as 
we can. One of the good things to come out of this affair is the 
fact that we have had many debates in the Folketing in which 
each member has had an opportunity to personally address the 
situation. I will not shift my responsibility to others, but it 
is important to have gone through this process. And for each 
debate we have had concerning our participation in the UN 
peacekeeping forces in Yugoslavia, the majority behind our 
political line has increased. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  For Haekkerup there was a regular changing of the guard in 
Danish security policy the day it was decided to send Olfert 
Fischer to the Gulf -- even though he was ordered not to shoot. 
  [Haekkerup] It is not only the world that has changed. Even 
the SF [Socialist People's Party] voted to create the 
International Brigade. At present only the Progress Party is 
against it. 
  When we lived under the peace of the Cold War, things were 
simpler. The final apocalypse was a possibility, but a 
theoretical possibility. Today we live with the everyday reality 
of Danish soldiers being in a war zone and being shot at every 
day. Danish solders are not only being sent out on peacekeeping 
missions. As members of the International Brigade and as 
peacemakers for the rest of the world they might participate in 
real battles. 
  [Bistrup] Are we mentally equipped to pay the price for such 
an engagement? 
  [Haekkerup] I think I am finding an incredible maturity in 
the Danish people. There is no doubt but that public opinion has 
become more robust. 
  Something has also happened in the development of Danish 
public opinion. UN participation has contributed to giving our 
defense forces a completely different profile from what they had 
before. 
  Our defense forces have become a cooperative partner and an 
instrument of our foreign policy. Previously our mission was to 
deter our enemy. We have now become cooperative partners; an 
instrument for foreign policy. 
  It is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that negotiates, but 
it 
is we who deliver the hardware. 
  We are training Baltic soldiers in Denmark and they will go 
with us to Croatia to see how we conduct a peacekeeping effort. 
Such is the present reality. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  In a very short time Minister of Defense Haekkerup will 
travel to Sarajevo in order to meet the hardy reality there. And 
John Le Carre's romantic reality must wait a little longer.

  [Text] The Cyprus Committee of Solidarity With Kurdistan 
revealed that in the past Theofilos Yeoryiadhis received many 
telephone calls from people speaking Turkish who threatened to 
kill him. It was also revealed that, according to information 
at the committee's disposal, one of the next possible targets of 
Turkish secret agents is Lieutenant General Dhimitrios Matafias, 
former National Guard Commander, who is considered to play a 
leading role in Greek activities in support of the Kurds. The 
committee has briefed the Greek police about this information. 
  These revelations were made by members of the Committee of 
Solidarity With Kurdistan at a news conference this afternoon on 
the abominable assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis. The news 
conference was given in the House of Representatives building in 
the presence of representatives from all the parliamentary 
parties, which condemned the assassination and praised the 
personality of the fighter for human rights, Theofilos 
Yeoryiadhis. 
  On behalf of the House of Representatives, Vasos 
Lissaridhis, 
EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] chairman, said that a 
House delegation will visit New York to condemn the ongoing 
oppression of the Kurdish people and the assassination of 
Theofilos Yeoryiadhis to the UN secretary general. Mr. 
Lissaridhis also said that the infiltration of Turkish agents 
into the free areas will be raised for debate by the House 
plenary session. 
  Speaking on behalf of the Committee of Solidarity With 
Kurdistan, Lazaros Mavros said that the action of the Turkish 
secret agencies has also extended into the free areas of Cyprus.

  [Text] Brussels (DPA) -- According to Finance Minister 
Theo Waigel, the Federal Government still has to discuss 
Germany's contribution to the European Union [EU] purse. On the 
sidelines of the EU finance ministers' meeting in Brussels, 
Waigel said the Federal Government was currently forming its 
final opinion on the issue. The financial contribution was at 
this year's "agenda of European work." People in Germany were 
constantly criticizing that Bonn was transferring much more 
money to Bonn than Germany gets back. 
  Waigel said the Federal Government was abiding by the 
financial resolutions adopted at the summit meeting of heads of 
state and government in Edinburgh in late 1992. There it was 
agreed to increase the EU funds step by step until 1999. Theo 
Waigel said that "opportunities for variation, however," do 
exist not least as far as returning funds are concerned. With a 
balance of some 22 billion German marks [DM], Bonn is the EU's 
number one net payer, German critics have argued. 
  Waigel still does not rule out putting off the start into 
European Monetary Union. "We are not forced to do it in 1996," 
the minister said. In view of the weak European economy and the 
rising budget deficits in the member states, some countries were 
having difficulties to meet the conditions for the start into 
the common currency. Despite a short-term increase in the debt 
burden, Germany intends "to meet all criteria by 1995 or 1996, 
at the latest." 
  All "12" are seriously trying to surmount the hurdles for 
monetary union. In the current economic situation, however, the 
starting conditions have become more difficult "at a higher 
negative level," Waigel said. In the view of experts, no member 
state was currently meeting all conditions regarding inflation, 
capital market interest rates, budget deficit, and state debts. 
  According to the finance minister, by taking over the debts 
of the Berlin Trust Agency next year, Bonn will "for a short 
period" surpass the debt threshold for monetary union (state 
debts must not go beyond 60 percent of the gross domestic 
product). Yet, through consolidation and tax increases in 1995, 
Germany would, at the same time, "take the burden off the 
capital market, which is what counts," Waigel said. 
  Moreover, the finance ministers agreed on the use of the 
so-called monetary reserves of the Union's budget, which the 
members states have to provide in the event of monetary 
adjustments -- for agricultural prices, for example. Contrary 
to fears that the funds in the agricultural budget might not be 
sufficient for the coming years, Waigel held the view that there 
is still enough room to maneuver. 
  The EU finance ministers protested against U.S. plans to 
charge foreign banks fees for bank regulation. They unanimously 
adopted a demarche to be sent to Washington. The U.S. plans 
were infringing on GATT world trade regulations and might 
unilaterally make non-American credit institutions pay heavily.

  [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) received Macedonian [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov 
today. The two politicians discussed the serious tensions 
between Skopje and Athens, which even exacerbated after the 
imposition of the Greek embargo. Kinkel expressed understanding 
of the attitude of the FYROM not to negotiate under the pressure 
of the Greek embargo, the Foreign Ministry announced after the 
meeting. However, it is important to prevent another increase 
in the tensions and to also show understanding for the Greek 
worries regarding territorial claims against the neighboring 
province of Macedonia "by clarifying the situation." 
  Gligorov, who privately attended a European forum in Bonn 
for 
three days, stressed his readiness for negotiations without any 
preconditions at a news conference on Wednesday [16 March]. 
However, it is out of the question to comply with Greek wishes 
for bilateral talks on the name of Macedonia used on both sides 
of the border, because no results have been achieved in the past 
two years. Now an overall package for this internationally 
recognized FYROM must be presented at the negotiating table, 
Gligorov pointed out.

  [Text] Duesseldorf (DPA) -- North Rhine-Westphalian 
Interior Minister Herbert Schnoor has called for an immediate 
stop of all arms deliveries to Turkey. In an interview with DPA 
on Saturday [19 March] the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] politician said that, in view of the Ankara regime's 
escalating military attacks against the Kurdish people, the 
federal government must impose a complete arms embargo. 
  Otherwise, the minister said, "Germany will be contributing 
to Turkey's slide into a maelstrom of military violence from 
which it will not be able to escape." Schnoor stressed: 
"Anyone who supplies military weapons to a NATO partner without 
making sure that these weapons are not used against minorities 
in this partner's country gives people reason to flee instead of 
eliminating such reasons." 
  The SPD politician emphasized: "A tragedy is taking place in 
southeast Turkey that will not be without effect on the internal 
peace of our country." According to him, many more than 70,000 
mostly Kurdish refugees have come from Turkey to Germany over 
the past there years. This corresponds to the number of 
inhabitants in a city like Castrop-Rauxel in the Ruhr area. At 
the same time, the recognition quota for asylum applications is 
higher than for any other primary country of origin. 
  Against the background of escalating conflicts between the 
Turkish army and the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which is 
also becoming increasingly violent in Germany, Schnoor warned 
the Turkish Government "to give political reason priority over 
military operations." 
  On the occasion of the forthcoming Kurdish New Year Nevruz, 
the minister appealed to Kurds in Germany not to let themselves 
be tempted to commit criminal acts, neither by the PKK nor by 
other organizations. The celebrations will begin next Monday 
and will probably be held throughout Germany until mid-week.

  [Text] Ankara -- On Monday [21 March] Turkish security 
forces restricted several groups of Germans, who wanted to 
observe the Nevruz celebrations and the local elections next 
Sunday in the Kurdish area, in their freedom of movement. This 
was learned from reports by the people affected and by the 
German Embassy in Istanbul on Monday. Turkey had previously 
declared "observers" from Germany "unwanted." 
  In Cizre, in southeastern Turkey, one of the main sites of 
the fights between the militant Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) 
and the security forces, about 20 Germans were stuck in their 
hotel on Monday. According to them, their passports had been 
confiscated and would be returned only if they agree to leave 
the region. Angelika Langehl-Weyrer of the North 
Rhine-Westphalian land association of the Greens said they are 
permitted to move around freely and have not been arrested, but 
the streets are "full with military and police" and it has been 
"recommended" that they stay in the hotel. 
  Another group of 17 Germans, who were taken from Igdir in 
eastern Turkey to Erzurum on Sunday, were on their way back to 
Igdir on Monday afternoon, according to information provided by 
German diplomatic circles. They, too, had had their passports 
taken away. 
  It was unclear on Monday how many German groups, including 
politicians of the Social Democratic Party and Greens, trade 
union representatives, and employees of relief organizations and 
human rights groups, are in the region. "However, the situation 
is calm and we do not have any reports that the Germans are in 
danger," a spokesman of the German Embassy in Ankara said. 
  A group of 52 Germans who had been sent back from Van in 
eastern Turkey to Istanbul over the weekend did not rule out 
another attempt to go to the region of unrest. A spokesman for 
the group said the three Kurdish interpreters, who had 
accompanied them from Germany and whom the Turkish police wanted 
to arrest, have "disappeared without trace." "The three have 
not been arrested; they said good-bye to us voluntarily, after 
the German Embassy did not guarantee that they could return to 
Germany with us." [sentence as received]

  [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- According to German diplomatic 
circles, none of the approximately 200 German "observers" of the 
Nevruz celebrations have been arrested in Turkey. On Tuesday 
[22 March] Turkish Government officials complained that 
unsuccessful attempts at provocation by German journalists in 
the provinces of unrest in the country's east and southeast, 
which are mainly inhabited by Kurds, have been registered "with 
great regret." According to their own statements, the Germans 
want to observe the local elections and the Nevruz celebrations 
on Sunday. 
  According to diplomatic circles in Ankara, the 17 members of 
a Hamburg group in Batman, in southeastern Turkey, accompanied 
their interpreter to the police station out of solidarity, and 
returned to their hotel on Monday evening. The interpreter is 
no longer in police custody either. 
  Diplomats in the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the German 
groups should know that Workers Party of Kurdistan leader 
Abdullah Ocalan "is no longer taken seriously by his Kurdish 
fellow-citizens." Furthermore, it was said that the Germans who 
want to "experience" the local elections on Sunday after the 
Nevruz celebrations are considered "tourists" rather than 
"observers."

  [Text] Bonn -- According to Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther (Christian Democratic Union), the majority of the Kurds 
who were actively involved in the weekend rioting [19-20 March] 
may be deported to Turkey. Mere membership in the Kurdish 
ethnic group does not mean that those affected face human rights 
violations or the death penalty in their home country, Kanther 
told journalists in Bonn on Monday. This alone would provide a 
reason for refraining from a deportation. Possible arrest in 
Turkey is no such reason. 
  Harald Thiemann, chairman of the German Police Trade Union, 
demanded negotiations between Germany and Turkey aimed at 
preventing the death sentence for criminals deported from 
Germany. German citizens and policemen can no longer accept the 
fact that "a war is being waged" by extremists "on the backs of 
German police officers" under the protection of the Human Rights 
Convention, Thiemann stressed today. Dozens of policemen were 
injured during the weekend rioting. The authorities have 
initiated over 500 legal investigations against demonstrators. 
  Kanther once more called emphatically on the courts and 
foreign authorities to fully apply the penal code to those who 
committed crimes and to make "massive" use of the existing 
possibilities for deportation. Only a minority of the Kurds 
involved in the riots actually faced political persecution in 
their home country and have been recognized as political 
refugees. As far as "normal" supporters of the Kurdish Workers 
Party [PKK] are concerned, it should not be a problem to deport 
them, Kanther pointed out. 
  The interior minister defended the ban on the PKK in 
Germany. 
Nobody assumed that the activities of the party and its 
subdivisions could be stopped immediately. Yet the measure 
should make it clear that Germany is no resting place for the 
PKK. However, more violent incidents cannot be ruled out 
completely.

  [Text] Bremen (DPA) -- Lufthansa in Bremen will retrain 76 
Chinese combat pilots as pilots for passenger planes. The young 
pilots are to arrive at the Lufthansa passenger plane pilot 
school in Phoenix, Arizona, by the end of this month. The 
tender was issued by Air China, the largest of the seven Chinese 
airlines. 
  Lufthansa hopes that it will subsequently be able to take 
over the training program for the Boeing 737, which would be 
held in Bremen. Since aviation is increasing in China, 
thousands of pilots have to be trained, a Lufthansa spokesman 
said. At the end of the 1980's, the passenger plane pilot 
school took over consulting tasks at the pilot school in central 
China.

<F P=106> ["PARIS MATCH"-B.V.A. Opinion Poll: "Balladur Down Two </F>
Points: End of His Period of Grace, for 58 Percent of the 
French, He Lulls the People. Juppe Enjoys Highest Confidence 
Rating: Up Nine Points"] 
  [Text] The latest PARIS MATCH-B.V.A. opinion poll discloses 
that the period of grace which the prime minister was enjoying, 
is over. Edouard Balladur's popularity dropped by 2 percent, 
although he is still supported by 53 percent of the people. Our 
survey reveals that 58 percent of the French think that he has a 
tendency to lull the French to sleep; 51 percent think he does 
not speak the truth. An absolute majority of those interviewed 
think that the prime minister has the style of a head of state, 
but there is also a negative side to this: 51 percent state 
that he thinks too much about the presidential election. 
Francois Mitterrand sees his popularity ratings rise by 3 
percent, tilting the balance between positive and negative 
opinions into the positive region again. The big winner in this 
confidence poll is [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, whose rating 
soars by 9 percent.

  This survey was conducted on a sample representative of the 
French population aged 18 years and over. The question 
referring to legislative election voting intentions was asked to 
2,948 persons between 15 and 18 February and between 1 and 4 
March 1994; the other questions were out to 973 persons between 
1 and 4 March. Voting intentions are calculated on the basis of 
the number of persons registered for the elections. Sampling 
was done according to the quota method: sex; age; occupation of 
family head; and region and area (city, rural...). Results 
should be interpreted taking into account the usual error 
margins related to any poll and the size of the sample. There 
error margins are: approximately one to two points for voting 
intentions; approximately two to three points for the overall 
results; approximately four to five points for the results 
referring to the large political families.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Deployment of Italian </F>
Troops Possible, Fabbri Says"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 17 Mar (ANSA) -- Italian troops could be 
deployed in Bosnia only once a peace agreement has been reached 
by all warring parties and only in the framework of a NATO 
operation on behalf of the United Nations, Italian Defense 
Minister Fabio Fabbri told the press here Thursday [17 March]. 
  Speaking with the press after his meeting with General 
George 
Joulwan, commander of Atlantic alliance forces in Europe, the 
Italian minister said that, until now, no request has been made 
for the deployment of Italian troops in Bosnia and, were this to 
occur in the future, the decision would be up to the Italian 
Government and parliament. 
  Nevertheless, Fabbri did state that "in the future, I think 
that, with a peace agreement signed by all sides and in the 
framework of a NATO operation to ensure its application, the 
possible use of the Italian military would be, in effect, 
plausible." 
  During today's meeting, Fabbri said General Joulwan voiced 
the gratitude of the Atlantic alliance for the "extraordinary" 
support for operations in the former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Andreatta Looks </F>
Towards Italy's Duty Presidency"] 
  [Text] Rome, 17 Mar (ANSA) -- Italy will call an 
inter-governmental conference to map out modifications to 
European Union [EU] institutions, to take into account new 
members, when it takes over the European Union rotating 
presidency, for the first half of 1996, Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta said here on Thursday [17 March]. 
  In an address to the International Affairs Institute, which 
also served as an occasion to review his tenure as Italy's 
diplomatic chief, Andreatta observed how "there is a fundamental 
intolerance towards institutional questions" in European Union 
member states, "even among the original members. When the 
question was raised to prepare for the inter-governmental 
conference to modify the institutions almost no one, except 
Italy, appeared in favor of speeding up the time table." 
  The Italian diplomatic chief went on to add how only now, 
with the conclusion of membership negotiations with Sweden, 
Norway, Finland and Austria, "have we, in a most casual way, 
been able to guide things towards a commitment in Corfu (the EU 
summit ending the Greek duty presidency in June) where 
government chiefs will appoint their permanent representatives 
to the committee which must prepare the inter-governmental 
conference." 
  Andreatta then went on to list some possible alternatives 
for 
institutional change, including "...an Upper House, one of 
government representatives, with a leadership in which some 
Member States, given their size and presence in the EU, become 
permanent members" as well as members "which represent the 
continuity of action." 
  Andreatta's proposal is that of the "hard core" approach 
which has been under discussion for several months, in which 
several states push forward and even go beyond the path set down 
in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. "At present," the 
foreign minister observed, "the debate on the hard core must 
take into account Britain, which is irreplaceable in Europe." 
  The Italian diplomatic chief went on to recall how some of 
"the most important steps we have taken in the last decade have 
been thanks to Britain. Sometimes Britain's opposition has 
helped the European Community move forward.... I would not like 
the hard core approach to leave out one of the most original and 
important Member States." 
  According to Andreatta, the 1996 inter-governmental 
conference on institutional reform will represent a turning 
point for building a united Europe and "the series of duty 
presidencies, between Germany's and Italy's, will set the pace 
for those which must govern these processes." 
  "But the times are not easy ones to modify and accelerate 
the 
European process" Andreatta concluded, in reference to the 
intolerance to institutional reform "...but occasions like 
these, which could even lead to failure, must be exploited and 
those with more to offer should perhaps try to offer more."

been implemented? How can it be put into effect in view of the 
country's economic situation? 
  [Fabbri] The Defense Ministry is going ahead with the 
implementation of the new model, but is constrained by how much 
is permitted under the current legislation and the resources 
that are available. Up to now it has gone ahead by optimizing 
the use of financial resources, and by only including programs 
that are totally coherent with the final objectives of the new 
defense model in the modernization and renewal budgets. 
  Furthermore, a provision was incorporated in the law 
introducing "corrective interventions for public funding" 
designed to encourage voluntary service, its goal being the 
formation of the first brigade to be made up entirely of 
volunteers. Finally, provision is being made for a revision of 
the central and peripheral structure of the three Armed Forces, 
with the goal of streamlining and optimizing the organization. 
  Unfortunately this action has well-defined limits, the first 
being the end of the legislature that has prevented these 
provisions, which form the indispensable legislative framework 
of the new defense model, from obtaining the approval of 
parliament. I am referring in particular to the decree relating 
to the reform of the military summits, and the decrees 
describing the new regulations governing voluntary military 
service and the institution of voluntary service for women. 
  Furthermore, the economic difficulties that the country is 
facing and that are preventing the necessary resources from 
being devolved for defense are not to be ignored. It would be 
impossible to make the necessary improvement on a qualitative 
level correspond with the decisive reduction in size of the 
military instrument without these resources. 
  [Stanglini] Could you briefly explain the reasons leading to 
the choice of the Tornado ADV for the integration of national 
air defense? When and how will this decision be implemented? 
  [Fabbri] It is a well-known fact that our air defense 
capacity needs to be improved. While confirming our intention 
to continue with the EF-2000 (new name of the EFA [European 
Fighter Aircraft]) program, we could not underestimate the 
operational limitations that are connected with the F-104/ASAM 
aircraft (although they have been modernized). We therefore 
found it necessary to resort to a "bridging" solution. 
  The study of various options highlighted the expediency, 
from 
the point of view of military requirements, of the 
cost/efficiency ratio, and the advantage to industry that would 
derive from the choice of the "mixed" option comprising 60 
F-104/ASAM aircraft (12 of which are training aircraft) and 24 
Tornado ADV's. In mid-January I spoke at length on these 
subjects in parliament, and also pointed out that the other 
hypotheses, centered on the total or partial purchase of F-15 or 
F-16 aircraft, did not appear to be expedient for a number of 
economic, logistic, technical, and industrial reasons. 
  As far as implementation times are concerned, I can then say 
that the ADV's are planned to go into service in 1995. This is 
long before the other solutions proposed would have gone into 
service. 
  [Stanglini] What is your evaluation of the possible creation 
of an Italian-French-Spanish naval force in the Mediterranean? 
Could this initiative be in contraposition to that of the 
Eurocorps? 
  [Fabbri] Certainly not. The presence of one of these 
countries itself, France, both in the Eurocorps and in the 
air-sea cooperation excludes possible divergencies and 
contrapositions between the two initiatives which, on the 
contrary, have a common goal; the reinforcement of European 
military collaboration within the WEU [Western European Union], 
something that Italy cares about in particular. 
  [Stanglini] Important subjects regarding the future of the 
alliance and stability and peace in Europe were dealt with at 
the recent NATO summit held in Brussels on 10 January. What do 
you think of the results? 
  [Fabbri] The problems under discussion were certainly many, 
and some of them were definitely thorny. However, I think that 
some progress was made. 
  The Partnership for Peace formula is a valid compromise 
between the various requirements and does not prejudice, but 
rather stimulates, further moves forward in the union, also of a 
military nature, with the countries of Central and East Europe. 
  Then the confirmed willingness of the alliance to work for 
peace in Europe reconfirms the obligation in the former 
Yugoslavia, that is already seeing important NATO air and naval 
initiatives. 
  Furthermore, we must not forget the agreement, made 
immediately after the summit between Presidents Clinton, Yeltsin 
and Kravchuk, on the nuclear disarmament of the Ukraine, that 
aims at eliminating one of the major worries in Europe. The 
resolution of the alliance also played an important role here in 
discouraging the perils and intransitable paths of exasperated 
nationalism. 
  [Stanglini] Why has the defense exhibition, which was 
initially planned for May 1994, been postponed? 
  [Fabbri] The organization of this exhibition has come up 
against a series of repeated postponements over recent years for 
technical-organizational reasons, also shared by the industrial 
world, and these have led to its postponement until the fall of 
1994. 
  The defense ministry agrees that it is opportune to hold 
this 
display in 1994. It should recapture the tradition of the naval 
display, which was the only display of its type to be organized 
in Italy in the past, and extend its range of interest to all 
the forces. So there are no preclusions or vetoes regarding 
this initiative, that is thought to be valid and advantageous. 
Precisely for this reason, it must receive the highest priority 
and this also applies to choosing the right time to hold it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Italy Critical of </F>
Its Japanese Car Import Quota"] 
  [Text] Rome, 19 Mar (ANSA) -- The 47,000 unit quota for 
Japanese automobile imports to Italy is too high, given the 
overall drop in the demand for new vehicles and the imports of 
the so-called transplants, Japanese cars made in Europe, 
according to a statement issued here Saturday by the Ministry 
for Foreign Trade. 
  According to the ministry, an in-depth review must be made 
of 
the situation which takes into account the various aspects of 
the question. "We are, in fact, even with the individual limits 
for the so-called protected markets, in a situation of a single 
market which allows free circulation among all European 
countries." 
  "Furthermore" the note continued, "the agreement to limit 
`yellow' car imports does not take into account the sale of 
transplants, which account for a significant share of the market 
held by Japanese makes and represents another element of serious 
concern for Italy." 
  The effective performance of the new car market, the 
ministry 
argued, is "in the end influenced by the competitiveness of 
prices, which determined, in 1993, only a partial use of the 
Japanese quota." 
  The statement from the Ministry for Foreign Trade went on to 
underscore how "it is still not clear whether, as in 1993, the 
possibility exists to verify and re-examine, in the course of 
the year, that adjustments which the evolution of the market 
would dictate."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "G-7/Jobs: Italian Labor Positive </F>
But Unenthusiastic"] 
  [Text] Rome, 17 Mar (ANSA) -- The outcome of the Group of 
Seven industrialized nations' conference on employment in 
Detroit was given an affirmative but lukewarm welcome by the 
Italian labor heavyweights, the big CGIL [Italian General 
Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade 
Unions] and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] trade union 
confederations whose leaders said the economic and labor 
ministers did little more than confirm last July's cost-of-labor 
agreement forged at home. 
  The single real regret noted was the failure of the 
conference to incorporate a "social clause" in international 
agreement which fix workers' minimum rights and standards of 
treatment. 
  Sergio D'Antoni of the CISL said it was "positive" for the 
industrialized nations to have shown an awareness that 
joblessness is not the product of "cynical and cheating destiny" 
and that it is possible to agree on policy among the individual 
nations to counter and defeat unemployment. 
  The confederation chief added, "The path to follow is 
already 
indicated for us" and cited the historic wage pact signed here 
last summer by the government and labor and management 
representatives. This agreement, he said, provides "important 
factors for flexibility, a clear choice for ongoing training and 
an indication of reduced work schedules for defending jobs." 
  The UIL leader, Pietro Larizza, endorsed this thinking in 
saying that Italy was able to anticipate "lines of action with 
the understanding of last July 3" and citing "continuous 
training and the link between training and production (as) the 
essential central points of that agreement." He also named on 
the positive side in Detroit the point that "everyone stressed 
the need not to lose professionalism and specialization, the 
wealth of the human factor at work, with the loss of jobs." 
  According to the assistant secretary general of the big CGIL 
confederation, Guglielmo Epifani, "The importance of the summit 
is that our government and that of the United States have placed 
the employment issue at the center of economic strategy." On 
the down side for Epifani was that, "the indications which 
emerged are very general and not applicable to all situations." 
  Also the CGIL official named the July agreement and said he 
hoped to see, after the general election at the end of March, 
"approval of measure already prepared or provided for in the 
understanding but which have not yet been adopted." In this 
connection, he called for strengthening part-time work and 
stronger attention from business and industry focused on 
defending jobs by acting on work schedules.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Recession Has Bottomed Out, </F>
Ministers Say"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 21 -- The recession has bottomed 
out and Italy is on the right track to recovery, according to a 
collection of statements by government ministers and leading 
financial figures compiled in an annual "Spring Report", 
published by the Euritalia Studies Center. 
  "I am firmly convinced that the worst of recession is now 
behind us," Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi wrote in his 
contribution to the report, adding: "I believe...that the 
turning point came at the beginning of last autumn and that 
signs of recovery in production have emerged since then." 
Ciampi also renewed his encouragement to foreign investors, "to 
have trust" in Italy, in its parliament, which has done a 
"tremendous" amount of work, and in the government, which has 
worked in a "concrete" fashion. 
  According to Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, Italy is "on 
the right tack" and now needs to "turn on the engines to push it 
forward." In his statements for the "Spring Report," Barucci 
also said that the new parliament to be elected next week and 
the new government that will follow "have only one road to 
follow, and there are no others," referring to austerity 
measures put in place to reduce the deficit, contain inflation 
and cut spending. Barucci also placed the poorer southern 
regions, indebtedness and unemployment as three main agenda 
items for future executives and parliaments. 
  Luigi Abete, head of the private employers' association, 
Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], in 
his statements warned against reducing working hours in an 
attempt to save jobs and suggested shifting taxes from capital 
and labor to consumption and distributed wages. Abete also 
asked future legislators to provide "political stability" and 
"consistent rules" to ensure growth and warned that the goal of 
stabilizing the ratio between debt and gross domestic product 
may not be reached in the next three years. 
  For his part, Finance Minister Franco Gallo spoke of 
so-called fiscal federalism, in which regions are given greater 
autonomy in setting and collecting taxes, saying that it must be 
"treated seriously and gradually." He also suggested possible 
changes to the current tax system. 
  The "Spring Report" defines unemployment as the single most 
important issue of the year, noting that for the first time ever 
the seven major industrialized countries have held a special 
meeting to discuss jobs. 
  The report noted that unemployment in Italy gradually rose 
from 7.7 percent in 1979 to 11 percent early this year, and 
suggested where to focus energies: research and technological 
development; professional training; a more flexible job market; 
expansion of so-called industrial districts; improving the 
credit system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "State Debt Nearing </F>
2,000-Trillion-Lire Mark"] 
  [Text] Rome, 21 Mar (ANSA) -- The Bank of Italy's 
supplementary bulletin released today reported that the Italian 
state indebtedness is currently only 190.324 billion lire short 
of hitting the 2,000 trillion lire mark (1.176 trillion dollars). 
  In December 1993, this figure for the first time crashed 
through the 1,800 trillion lire threshold: the exact figure was 
1,809,676 billion lire. 
  With respect to the previous year this was a growth of 10.5 
percent. This meant that the monthly growth in Italy's state 
debt had been something like 14.3 trillion lire. 
  Furthermore, these figures include the accumulated 
indebtedness of the central administration only and exclude 
local administrations and public agencies now transformed into 
joint stock companies. 
  Should these be included in the calculation as well, a much 
more complicated matter, the total public indebtedness could be 
ascertained only up to October of last year when it was 
estimated to be 1,815,692 billion lire (that same month the 
total state debt was 1,770,966 billion lire).

  [Text] Rome, 21 Mar (ANSA) -- The outstanding loans or bad 
debts held by Italian credit institutions continues to rise 
sharply and at the end of last year totaled in the neighborhood 
of 70 trillion lire, over 41.5 billion dollars, sector sources 
confirmed here Monday [21 March]. 
  The outstanding debts included over 46 trillion lire in 
expired loans together with 23 trillion in bad debts held by 
special credit institutes. 
  Outstanding medium-to-long-term loans held by special credit 
institutes jumped 13.9 percent in December, over the previous 
month, and 34.1 percent on a 12-month basis. 
  Short-term bad debts, however, for the first time declined, 
dipping from 47.029 trillion lire in November to 46.335 trillion 
lire at the end of last year, for a reduction of 1.4 percent. 
Outstanding short-term debts, however, rose 23.7 percent in 
December compared to the same month in 1992.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Andreatta Warns Against Political </F>
Extremes"] 
  [Text] Rome, 17 Mar (ANSA) -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta on Thursday [17 March] lashed out against 
any radical shift in Italy, Left or Right, and stressed how any 
radical position would be of no use to the nation's foreign 
policy. 
  In an address to the International Affairs Institute, which 
represented an overview of his tenure as Italy's diplomatic 
chief, Andreatta warned against those "who want to confine 
foreign policy inside a geo-political reality, like the Italian 
Right would appear to, which in some way abandons its 
(traditional) openness." 
  Andreatta went on to voice his opposition to those who call 
for the re-organization of the Foreign Ministry. "I know very 
well what needs to be reformed, but I am skeptical towards those 
positions which claim to be novel. It is my opinion that 
Italian society needs a more adequate foreign policy, but based 
on traditional lines." 
  The foreign minister, a trained economist, then argued how, 
at least based on the pre-election statements, radical shifts in 
either direction would offer no "useful solutions for the 
nation's economic problems." 
  The foreign policy platforms of the various forces running 
for the March 27-28 elections were also reviewed by Andreatta in 
an article published by the magazine IL REGNO, with the foreign 
minister observing "What is essential is the interest a nation 
shows towards playing a leading role on an international level. 
Very often, our country, even those people who are culturally 
sophisticated, when faced with an international dilemma waiver 
between a crude vision of the balance of power or a disarmed 
vision which does not appear to understand the plurality of 
views, the interests on which the community of nations is based."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Pledges Battle Against </F>
Mafia"] 
  [Text] Palermo, 20 Mar (ANSA) -- TV 
tycoon-turned-politician Silvio Berlusconi pledged here today 
that votes for his Go Italy [Forza Italia] party in the imminent 
general elections will be votes against the Mafia, apparently 
making up for what was perceived as an unwillingness to make an 
outright disclaimer of Mafia support in a radio debate aired 
earlier. 
  Debating with Left Democrat leader Achille Occhetto, his 
main 
electoral rival, Berlusconi was asked about a declaration from 
an imprisoned Mafia boss late in February who said Sicilian 
organised crime would be voting for Berlusconi. The Milan-based 
tycoon, who threw his hat into the political ring in January, 
first said he thought it was impossible to speculate if the 
Mafia would vote in any one way. 
  When asked for an outright disclaimer, he then said he 
failed 
to see how a party entering an election for the first time could 
be accused of links with the Mafia; then remarked that "anyone 
can say they are going to vote for anyone else," leading 
Occhetto, a major figure in the Progressive Alliance fighting 
Berlusconi and the right-wingers, to comment: "I take note that, 
three times over, no response was forthcoming." 
  The radio debate, a transcript of which was released 
yesterday evening, went on the air amidst allegations to Go 
Italy's left, from the moderate conservatives to radical 
leftists, that ancien regime figures and ties are being recycled 
in the new party's ranks, especially thanks to Berlusconi's 
long-standing relationship with ex-Premier Bettino Craxi and his 
discredited Socialist Party. At the same time, rumours began 
circulating yesterday evening that Marcello Dell`Utri, 
managing-director of Berlusconi's advertising arm Publitalia, 
and already under investigation in Milan with others for false 
company accounting, had been linked by a Mafia state's witness 
to organised crime bosses. 
  Judicial sources would say only that Mafia boss Salvatore 
Cancemi had been questioned recently by prosecutors from various 
Italian cities, but refused to specify about what. The chief 
prosecutor in Caltanisetta, Sicily, Giovanni Tinebra, added 
today that the alleged links made with Cancemi's testimony were 
"absolutely gratuitous." 
  Tinebra also joined the school of judicial thinking that 
takes Cancemi's disclosures with a strong pinch of salt. The 
turncoat, whose codename is Omega, has yet to be admitted to the 
official witness protection programme. 
  Usually reliable judicial and investigative sources in Rome 
said, however, that questioning of other Mafia witnesses seemed 
to corroborate Cancemi's claims. 
  Other reports from judicial circles in Palermo said that one 
line of investigation against Dell`Utri claims he was 
responsible for recycling Mafia drug trafficking funds. 
  Allegations of links between Berlusconi, Dell`Utri and the 
Mafia date back to the 1980s. Testimony from Berlusconi in June 
1987 confirmed that, in 1975, Dell`Utri got Berlusconi to give a 
suspected Mafia drug trafficker, Vittorio Mangano, a job as 
bailiff at his villa at Arcore near Milan. 
  Other testimony from a financier, Filippo Rapisarda, 
reported 
conversations in late 1978 in which one Mafia boss, Domenico 
Teresi, visiting the office of Rapisarda's then partner 
Dell`Utri, told him Berlusconi had suggested he should enter a 
partnership with him in a private TV station, in an operation 
"worth 10 billion lire." 1978 was about the time when 
Berlusconi started building his TV and media empire. 
  Fighting these and other allegations such that Sicilian 
branches of his department store chain, Standa, are run jointly 
with Mafia figures, Berlusconi, arriving for a Go Italy rally at 
Palermo's Mediterranean Fair, pledged that the votes his party 
receives "in Sicily, Campania, Calabria and throughout Italy" 
would all be votes against the Mafia. He also voiced his "deep 
appreciation" for churchmen whom he described as "heroes" in the 
front line against organised crime, a reference to yesterday's 
slaying of a priest near Naples. 
  Over 7,000 supporters were reported as attending the rally 
for which Berlusconi's TV networks created a live nationwide 
tie-up. Figures released by the Berlusconi polling institute, 
Diakron, for March 1, before the publication ban on poll 
results, claimed about 30 percent of the vote for Go Italy and 
40 percent in Sicily. Other polls have cited Go Italy at 20.25 
percent nationwide. 
  In other points, Berlusconi answered northern demands for 
federalism by saying that Italy will enjoy growth only if "North 
and South march together."

small dollar loan to buy vital equipment. 
  In Tula, several hundred kilometres to the south, a 
television services company is taking a similar credit to expand 
its activities, which include advertisement production. 
  Both borrowers are part of a programme launched by the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], at the 
behest of the Group of Seven nations, to foster small 
enterprises in Russia. 
  The EBRD has set aside $300 million and launched pilot work 
in Nizny Novgorod, Tula and Tomsk, in western Siberia. The aim 
is to deploy small amounts of EBRD money -- financing individual 
loans of $50,000-$75,000 -- through local financial institutions 
to introduce lenders and borrowers to the ways of the market. 
  It is a landmark development for the EBRD, which has been 
lending to, and taking equity stakes in, the active and 
developing private sectors in Central Europe. It has also 
participated in development projects in the remote republics of 
the former Soviet Union where hardly any private sector exists. 
  But nothing has been done, either by the EBRD or other 
international financial institutions, to fuel the growth of 
Russia's small businesses or entrepreneurs. 
  These have difficulties in borrowing from their own local 
banks, which are highly conservative and, in the main, staffed 
by former state employees. Emerging small businesses, the seed 
corn of any private sector, need to borrow to survive and 
prosper. 
  "We are working to our comparative advantage, focusing on 
the 
private sector and local enterprises as much as, if not more 
than, on joint ventures with foreign partners," says a senior 
EBRD official. "You can only really reach them through local 
financial institutions." 
  The EBRD provides all the money, but insists that local 
banks 
shoulder half the risk. It wants to involve both lender and 
borrower in the market, and to encourage the banks to reach out 
to more local businesses. The idea is to build on these pilots 
and, over the next year or so, to fan out across Russia. 
  It is one of the changes taking place in an institution once 
dubbed "the glistening bank" after the high-spending antics of 
Jacques Attali, former president. His successor, Jacques de 
Larosiere, shuns the oxygen of publicity as much as Mr Attali 
thirsted after it. But the former governor of the Banque de 
France has quietly begun to ring changes at the bank. 
  The Russian programme, for instance, reflects a shift from 
the EBRD's previous practice of almost always engaging in joint 
venture projects, where local firms have had a foreign investor 
as partner, in borrowing countries. But an internal task force 
report, set up by Mr de Larosiere to establish the EBRD's 
strategic objectives, urged improved country strategies, 
focusing credits and investments on local companies, not just on 
joint ventures. 
  More controversially, the report urges the bank to cut back 
on public sector loans, boosting lending to the private sector 
instead. But like everyone else who has addressed the issue, the 
report is silent on whether the bank should seek a changed 
mandate freeing it from the obligation to lend 60 percent to the 
private sector and fully 40 percent to the public sector. 
  Though public sector lending was inevitably higher when the 
EBRD began operating in 1991, private sectors have mushroomed in 
East Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
  By reorganising the EBRD, Mr de Larosire has gone some way 
to 
addressing this issue. He has merged the development and 
merchant banking arms of the bank, and established a "north" and 
"south" region, splitting the bank's operations along geographic 
lines. 
  A senior G-7 official said: "As it grew, the development and 
merchant banking teams became embarrassing. Teams moved around 
the same country without knowing the others were there." 
  Mr de LaroSiere, according to this official, has made "an 
extremely impressive start." Alongside the reorganisation,"the 
new president has imposed a more austere regime, eliminating the 
freespending expense account ways of the Attali bank." 
  He is also encouraging the gradual decentralisation of the 
bank, most of whose operations are run from its London 
headquarters in Broadgate, by boosting the number of EBRD local 
representatives. 
  This is even being considered as part of the Russian small 
business project. If it is successful and local officials 
eventually gain decisionmaking powers, this scheme might one day 
supersede the regional reorganisation. 
  But considerable challenges lie ahead. The EBRD rightly 
adopts a cautious attitude to loans for "industrial 
restructuring" -- converting, for instance, defence plants to 
peaceful use or scaling down the communist-era industrial 
monoliths -- because these are inherently high risk. 
  Strategically, it prefers new business creation because in 
the medium term this will probably become more important. The 
bank's task force report emphasises the quality of lending over 
quantity. While this may be the correct course, it could prove 
controversial. 
  One of the charges levelled against the Attali regime was 
the 
slow pace of lending compared with spending on the bank's new 
headquarters. Yet placing the weight on quality loans will 
ensure that continues. 
  The total value of projects approved by the end of last year 
amounted to ECU3.759 billion (2.9 billion pounds) (mobilising, 
in theory, some ECUll.405 billion in investments when private 
and insitutitional Western investment in EBRD projects is taken 
into account). 
  But only ECU556 million was disbursed at end-l993. Although 
the pace of loan, credit or equity agreements is quickening, the 
total still looks a drop in the ocean to participants in the 
emerging market economies in East Europe and the former Soviet 
Union. 
  Yet it is against this backdrop that the task force report 
audaciously urges shareholding governments to begin 
consideration of an EBRD capital increase next year. But it 
acknowledges that the emphasis on quality lending will slow the 
pace of agreements, and hence postpone the day of 
recapitalisation. 
  This policy, the report admits, could delay the point at 
which the EBRD, launched in 1991, breaks even from a current 
small loss. However, under Mr de Larosiere's austere and more 
focused management, the bank has just announced a profit of ECU4 
million for 1993 -- the first recorded. Emphasis on quality may 
delay decisive profitability by about two years into the latter 
half of the 1990's. 
  The EBRD annual meeting in St Petersburg in April is likely 
to prove uneventful, which is no doubt how Mr de Larosiere would 
like it. But since the volume of loan disbursements may grow 
only slowly, debate over a possible capital increase in three or 
four years may prove controversial for Western governments 
cutting back heavily on budget deficits.

<F P=106> [Reports by Lionel Barber and David Gardner in Brussels and </F>
Roland Rudd in London: "EU Offers Compromise on Voting"] 
  [Text] Britain and Spain are being offered an automatic 
right to delay European Union [EU] decisions for two months in 
an effort to resolve the crisis over entry terms for Sweden, 
Finland, Austria and Norway next year. 
  The compromise being informally offered by the 10 EU 
partners 
falls short of Anglo-Spanish demands to maintain present voting 
rules, whereby two big countries and one small member state can 
combine to block decisions. 
  But it might allow London and Madrid to proclaim a partial 
victory in their efforts to protect the interests of big member 
states when the Union expands from 12 to 16 countries. 
  The UK cabinet yesterday authorised Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign 
secretary, to reach an agreement that falls short of Britain's 
present position. But he was warned by colleagues that any deal 
must preserve the "substance" of the original position. Several 
ministers said that any compromise that could be interpreted as 
a climbdown could cause "uproar" in the party. 
  Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the 
government would continue to fight for Britain's interests at 
the heart of Europe. 
  At prime minister's questions, Mr John Major rebuked a 
Conservative Euro-sceptic who tried to draw him on the 
negotiations. He said Mr Hurd would defend "Britain's best 
interests without any delay in enlargement." Tory Euro-sceptics, 
led by Mrs Ann Winterton, unsuccessfully demanded a debate on 
the future shape of the EU. 
  Senior EU diplomats made clear that the "delaying minority" 
formula was the most the UK and Spain could expect when EU 
foreign ministers try, once again, to break the deadlock at a 
meeting in Brussels next Tuesday [22 March]. "They will not get 
all they want, but they will receive something," commented one 
official. 
  The compromise would give member states at risk of being 
outvoted an automatic right to one month's delay. The rotating 
presidency of the EU and the Commission would be asked to seek a 
consensus. The procedure could be repeated, again for a month, 
at which point member states could take a decision. 
  Mr Hurd has said the UK could live with a Spanish compromise 
on weighted voting. That would increase the threshold of the 
"blocking minority" from 23 to 27 votes, but it would not apply 
when three member states that together have 23 votes and 
represent more than lOO million people either oppose or abstain 
on a measure. 
  However, the informed judgement in Brussels is that formula 
is not acceptable to the European Parliament, which must approve 
accession of the four countries by May 4. 
  EU diplomats have also warned that several parliaments, 
notably those of Belgium and the Netherlands, would refuse to 
endorse the Anglo-Spanish proposals because they would paralyse 
decision-making and strengthen the power of the bigger states. 
  A compromise on voting weights would remain in force until 
1996.

<F P=106> [Article signed YR/SV: "The European Union and Eastern </F>
Countries -- Commissioner Van den Broek Advocates a 
Premembership Strategy"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 17 Mar (ATS) -- According to Commissioner 
Hans van den Broek, the European Union (EU) should propose a 
"premembership" strategy for the countries of Central and East 
Europe (CEEC). A multilateral political and economic context, 
which would be a "real forerunner to membership," should be 
established with those countries. 
  The accession of CEEC's to the EU will be facilitated by 
applying the bilateral association agreements that have been 
signed so far to each of them, Mr. van den Broek said. The 
commissioner, who addressed the Free University of Brussels, 
pleaded in favor of a "multilateral relation between the EU and 
the CEEC's which would eliminate the problems in trade exchanges 
and create a market big enough to attract investors." 
  A multilateral solution of that kind would be the best means 
to help CEEC countries meet the membership criteria settled at 
the European Council of Copenhagen in June 1993, he added. 
<H5>  Criteria for Membership </H5>
  The criteria have been extensively defined: a state ruled by 
law; institutional stability that guarantees democracy, respect 
for human rights, protection of minorities; ability to cope with 
the market trends within the Union. 
  But the enlargement to the east will also depend on the 
Union's ability to include new members, particularly with 
respect to the working mechanism of the Union. A date for 
opening negotiations cannot be settled at this point as two many 
uncertainties still remain on both sides. Mr. van den Broek 
thinks that 1997 should be an appropriate time to assess how the 
CEEC's are progressing toward membership and to decide what the 
next steps should be. 
  Poland, Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and 
Bulgaria each have signed an association agreement or a European 
agreement with the Twelve. Negotiations will soon start with 
Slovenia and later with the Baltic states. 
<H5>  Political Dialogue </H5>
  Those agreements allow for the establishment of a political 
dialogue. The Twelve have suggested that the CEEC's adopt a 
multilateral approach for enforcing them. However, several CEEC 
countries want to retain the possibility of a bilateral dialogue 
with the EU so as to break free from the others. 
  Hungary has announced that it intends to apply for EU 
membership in April. Other CEEC countries could follow. Mr. 
van den Broek made a statement aimed at those countries, saying 
that the order in which the applications would be introduced 
would not influence the order in which they would be accepted.

<F P=106> [James Blitz and Ivor Owen report: "Hurd Restresses Stance </F>
on EU Votes"] 
  [Text] Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday 
sought to reassure Conservatives that he would not strike an 
agreement on a new European Union [EU] voting system that would 
dilute British interests. 
  Addressing Conservatives in Poole last night, Mr Hurd said 
there was no guarantee that Britain would reach agreement with 
its EU partners on a new voting system when foreign ministers 
resumed talks on the issue next week. 
  "If we are to move forward as a Union of 16, it should be on 
the basis of as widespread consent as possible," he said. "That 
is the best way to avoid conflict and bickering on a permanent 
basis." 
  He said that the British public wanted the government to 
exercise judgment in the interests both of Britain and Europe. 
  EU member states propose that the threshold for the 
"blocking 
minority" should rise from 23 to 27 votes when four new 
countries enter the Union next year. Britain and Spain are 
opposing this, although both are being offered a compromise that 
would allow a minority of states to see a two-month delay in 
decisions. 
  Meanwhile, pressure intensified on the government yesterday 
to accept that its citizens should have a continuing right to 
initiate individual cases in the European Court of Human Rights. 
  Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, in a 
Commons debate on the Council of Europe, warned that Britain's 
reputation would be damaged if the government tried to insist 
that it should remain a conditional right subject to review at 
five-yearly intervals. 
  He said that Turkey, whose record on human rights would not 
commend itself to the British people, was the only country to 
have adopted a similar attitude. 
  Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, Foreign Office junior minister, said 
the 
UK government was still considering a suggestion that the right 
should be made mandatory.

<F P=106> [Reports by David Sharrock in Belfast and Patrick Wintour: </F>
"Adams Seeks Links With Unionists"] 
  [Text] Irish republicans have a duty to develop their 
contacts with Unionists to build peace, the Sinn Fein president 
Gerry Adams told supporters yesterday. 
  "I remain convinced that the IRA is willing to deal 
positively with any new eventuality. It is clear that the IRA 
is interested in developing the search for peace," he told a St 
Patrick's Day gathering in west Belfast. 
  What was required was a change in government policy. 
"Building peace may be messy and continually tragic and 
confused. It may be slow and circuitous," he said in an 
apparent reference to IRA mortar attacks on Heathrow and the 
murder of a RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) officer last week. 
  Identifying the source of all the violence as the continuing 
Anglo-Irish conflict, Mr Adams said it was the Government which 
held the key to progress. It was time for the realism displayed 
during the negotiations over Britain's disengagement from 
Zimbabwe "to be shown again in relation to their longterm 
intentions in Ireland." 
  He had no doubt that the opportunity for peace remained. 
"For 
all of us the prospect is at the same time exciting and 
frightening. It's a very dangerous time in our history." Making 
peace with one's enemies and opponents was a very difficult 
business. "We must expect set-backs, disappointments and 
diversions, but we are determined that when and if these arise 
we will overcome them." 
  Mr Adams struck a significantly softer tone than in his 
keynote speech at Sinn Fein's annual conference last month, when 
he called Northern Ireland's Unionist majority an Irish national 
minority. Partition had no longer failed, but had retarded, the 
development of democracy in Ireland. 
  "It is my firm conviction that Unionists can be persuaded to 
recognise that they share a common peaceful destiny with their 
fellow countrymen and women in the common territory of Ireland," 
he said. It was obvious that the Government's role as persuader 
was key to this. But, "we in Sinn Fein, who profess to be 
anti-sectarian and secular, have a duty to develop our contacts 
with the Unionist community. We must reconise, be sympathetic 
and sensitive to what Unionists are being asked to consider and 
commit themselves to, if a peace dialogue is to develop. 
  ``I am calling on nationalists and republicans to be aware 
of 
what it means to be a Unionist as this century draws to a 
close.'' There was also a need for Unionists to seek 
clariflcation of the Government's longterm intentions in 
Ireland. It was ironic that Unionists and nationalists shared a 
common distrust of the Government. 
  The remarks may have been directed at U.S. opinion, which 
appears to be hardening against the IRA as Albert Reynolds, the 
Irish leader, visits Washington seeking support for the Downing 
Street Declaration. 
  House of Representatives Speaker Tom Foley, a leading 
Irish-American politician, conceded that the United States had 
been wrong to grant Mr Adams a visa this year. 
  In the Commons Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Ulster Secretary 
said: 
"The best hope for peace is that Sinn Fein realise that violence 
is going to get them nowhere." 
  Sir Patrick, during Northern Ireland questions, came under 
pressure from his own backbenchers for a security crackdown, and 
from the Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux to shelve 
discussions on possible cross-border institutions during the 
present round of bilateral talks with the constitutional 
parties. Mr Molyneaux said the parties should instead 
concentrate on agreeing a devolved assembly in Northern Ireland. 
  David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, told Sir 
Patrick to stop using the Downing Street Declaration as an 
excuse for failing to press ahead with talks on devolved 
government for Northern Ireland. 
  Although Sir Patrick said he would not uncouple the socalled 
Strand One talks on devolution from the other two Strands 
(cross-border institutions and relations between the two 
governments) Ulster Unionists are privately hopeful that in 
practice the current round of talks will be restricted to Strand 
One. 
  Members of the Northern Ireland backbench committee are to 
visit the RUC shortly to study the problem of co-operation with 
the Garda over border security.

  [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government demands that Turkey 
keep its promise to grant freedom of movement to German 
observers at the municipal elections in the southeastern Turkish 
areas populated by Kurds. According to reports by the Foreign 
Ministry in Bonn, Ambassador to Turkey Horst Oesterhelt was 
instructed on Monday [21 March] to ask the Turkish Interior 
Ministry to "observe strictly" its promise to grant the group of 
observers at the municipal elections in southeast Turkey 
security and freedom of movement. 
  The Foreign Ministry regrets that the Turkish promise to 
grant security and freedom of movement to German observers in 
the Kurdish areas has not been kept. The promise had been made 
last Friday at a meeting in Washington between Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel and his Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin. Kinkel 
sent a reminder telegram to Ankara on Saturday, when the arrest 
of the observers became known. 
  A delegation from Mainz and Wiesbaden that is to monitor the 
human rights situation at the Kurdish Nevruz New Year 
celebrations has arrived in Kurdistan, in contrast to other 
human rights groups. In a telephone conversation, one of the 
participants said the delegation is in the Batman region and 
wants to go on to Kozluk after the elections to prepare a twin 
city program. The six-member delegation, including Friedel 
Gruetzmacher, land parliament group chairperson of the Mainz 
Greens, said they can move about freely, but are being monitored 
by police.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with David Kyd, information director of </F>
the International Atomic Energy Agency, by Hans-Joachim Wiese; 
Kyd in Vienna -- live] 
  [Text] [Wiese] Mr. Kyd, the IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency] is responsible for the inspection of the nuclear 
facilities in the DPRK -- actually not only in the DPRK but all 
over the world -- but it is massively prevented from doing its 
duty by Pyongyang. Therefore, the day before yesterday the IAEA 
Governors Council decided to refer the issue to the UN Security 
Council. What does your Agency expect from that? 
  [Kyd] We are indeed the inspection agency, but, of course, 
we cannot force the DPRK to open the facilities in the DPRK for 
our inspections if the DPRK has problems with that. And this is 
the case. Our director general will go to New York today. 
There will be a UN Security Council meeting, and I could 
imagine that the Security Council will adopt a resolution next 
week. We hope that the DPRK will realize that the matter has to 
be clarified and that this will increase security not only in 
Asia but also in the DPRK itself. 
  [Wiese] Inspectors of your organization have already gone to 
the DPRK, and they have been able to visit a few nuclear 
facilities. The problem probably is just one very specific 
facility. Mr. Kyd, what are the specific findings of the IAEA 
regarding the question of whether or not the DPRK has the 
nuclear bomb? 
  [Kyd] For a nuclear weapon you need three things: First, a 
carrier system; second, an ignition mechanism -- one must be 
able to master that; and third, fissionable material, which is 
plutonium. It is our job to find out how much plutonium the DPRK 
actually has. The DPRK claims it has produced just a few grams. 
However, we suspect there is more than that. We do not know 
yet how much, and we were prevented from finding out because 
over the past two weeks, as you have already mentioned, we have 
not been permitted to take samples in one facility, in one 
laboratory, where plutonium has been produced in the past, to 
find out what the level of radioactivity is like in this 
facility. This means we do not know whether this facility is 
utilized fully or whether, as the North Koreans claim, nothing 
has been produced there recently. 
  [Wiese] The IAEA resolution, which I mentioned at the 
beginning, threatens more far-reaching measures, if the DPRK 
continues to be unwilling to cooperate. What is one to 
understand by that? 
  [Kyd] We ourselves can take only limited measures because 
the IAEA is actually responsible only for inspections. However, 
in the UN Security Council it is clear that both a warning and 
economic sanctions are conceivable if all members of the UN 
Security Council, including China, agree to them. 
  [Wiese] The DPRK, however, is threatening to leave the 
Nonproliferation Treaty if international pressure continues. 
What would such a step mean? 
  [Kyd] Of course, it would be very bad, because 161 countries 
are participating in this treaty, and it would be the first time 
in 25 years that a country leaves the treaty. It would create a 
precedent and would not to be welcomed. On the other hand, the 
international community also has to consider whether, after one 
year, there is any sense in negotiating with a country that is 
obviously unwilling to fulfill its obligations. This is not a 
good example for other countries in the future. One could 
expect another country to try to get concessions by saying: I 
am neither in the treaty nor outside. What do you offer me? 
  We want to prevent that, too. 
  [Wiese] Mr. Kyd, next year an international conference must 
decide whether or not the Nonproliferation Treaty, which was 
concluded 25 years ago, as you said, is to be extended. The day 
before yesterday, the following countries did not join the vote 
of the Board of Governors -- either by abstaining or by voting 
against: Libya, Brazil, India, and Indonesia. China abstained. 
All these are potential nuclear powers. This is not a good 
sign for the future of the Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  [Kyd] I believe one cannot draw such a conclusion from that. 
It was rather a disagreement about whether or not pressure of 
this kind by the UN Security Council is appropriate, whether or 
not it will be effective. I certainly believe that the 
Nonproliferation Treaty will be extended next spring, that is, 
in one year. Whether for another 10 years or for another 25 
years is not yet clear. However, it is a treaty that has been in 
effect for 25 years already. There are only five nuclear powers 
all over the world and three so-called threshold countries -- 
Israel, Pakistan, and India -- which have perhaps already 
mastered this technology. This is a good result. Now we have 
South Africa in this treaty, and soon Brazil and Argentina will 
join and the republics of the former Soviet Union. I think this 
is certainly positive. 
  Of course, now there is an acute case -- namely the DPRK. On 
the other hand, however, 160 countries have joined the treaty, 
and we believe the current case should not be interpreted too 
dramatically. Of course, for northeast Asia, however, it would 
be a serious case indeed if the DPRK were to leave the treaty. 
Then the situation will become very sensitive there, not only 
for South Korea but also for Japan, and even for China. 
  [Wiese] Thank you very much. This was David Kyd, 
information director of the IAEA in Vienna. Good bye, Mr. Kyd.

  [Text] Paris, March 22 (AFP) -- France would like the UN 
Security Council to impose sanctions against North Korea unless 
the latter agrees to full inspections of its nuclear facilities, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said Tuesday [22 March]. 
  He said the Security Council should issue a "very firm 
warning" to convince Pyongyang to allow inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out the 
necessary inspections. 
  The IAEA Board of Governors decided Monday to refer the 
North 
Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. 
  Speculation has increased that the Council might decide on 
punitive action against North Korea, suspected of developing 
nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Brussels, 17 Mar 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- With the 
adoption of the report by Carlos Robles Piquer on the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty which must be extended in 1995, the EP 
[European Parliament] Committee on Energy, Research and 
Technology has called on the European Union to define "as 
uniform a position as possible" on this issue in order to 
reinforce the guarantees against the risk of proliferation. 
According to MEPs, the European Union should tend, moreover, 
towards establishing an international and universal control 
system of the "complete cycle" of uranium, plutonium and 
possibly thorium, for civilian purposes. In addition, MEPs 
consider that, in the cooperation agreements with third 
countries, the Union should include clauses on the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Finally, MEPs took an 
explicit stand in favour of establishing a denuclearised zone in 
the Near East.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/234: "Agreement on the Fourth </F>
Research and Technological Development Framework Program of the 
European Union"] 
  [Text] An extremely important decision for European 
research was made on Monday, 21 March. Nine months after being 
proposed by the Commission, the Union's 4th Framework Program 
for Research and Technological Development [RTD] (1994-99) was 
the subject of an agreement between the various institutions. 
  "It is very satisfying," said Commissioner Antonio Ruberti, 
that it was possible to increase the total amount henceforth 
allocated to the program from ECU12 billion to ECU12.3 billion. 
This ensures the genuine continuity of the Community research 
effort. The reserve of ECU0.7 billion, to be unfrozen in 1996, 
will make it possible to increase the amount of funds available. 
  This new framework program will make it possible to put into 
action broad guidelines set out in the White Paper on Growth, 
Competitiveness, and Employment approved by the heads of state 
and government last December. Research and technological 
development occupies a strategic position among these guidelines. 
  The agreement also signalled an important victory at the 
institutional level, in that it served as a successful test of 
the conciliation procedure -- part of the co-decision procedure 
set out in the Maastricht Treaty which closely links the 
European Parliament to the decisions made. 
  The discussion on specific programs intended to ensure the 
operational implementation of the 4th framework program can be 
initiated immediately. In the coming days and in light of 
today's agreement, the Commission will finalize the proposals 
for specific programs which it adopted on 9 March. It will 
spare no effort to facilitate their approval before the end of 
this year. 
  With a total budget of ECU12.3 billion, plus a reserve of 
ECU0.7 billion to be unfrozen in 1996, the 4th framework program 
will cover the entire Community research effort for the period 
1994-98. 
  Called upon to contribute significantly toward improving the 
scientific and technological foundations of the European 
industrial system and improving the quality of life, it will aim 
primarily to ensure: 

  -  improved coordination and rationalized 
research efforts in Europe; 
  -  improved concentration within each 
field of research and RTD actions on a lower number of problems 
and generic technologies having an impact on multiple 
sectors; 
  -  improved distribution of research results, especially 
to small- and medium-sized businesses; 
  -  increased support by RTD 
in implementing the Union's other policies; 
  -  the development of 
links between research and education or training by undertaking, 
for the first time, research into the needs of education, 
training, and methodologies; 
  -  lastly, without this list being 
exhaustive, to better exploit the possible synergies between 
research policy and the policy on economic and social cohesion, 
while respecting the specific nature of each.

Brussels"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 20 Mar (ANP) -- Prime Minister Lubbers no 
longer has any interest in the European Commission presidency 
post. Rather, he is supporting former Belgian Prime Minister 
Wilfried Martens, who is ready to succeed Frenchman Jacques 
Delors. 
  According to Martens, Lubbers would have to be pressed very 
hard to become Commission president. "However, my impression 
from Netherlands politicians is that he has already made his 
decision," he said Sunday evening [20 March] on KRO's [Catholic 
Radio Broadcasting Company] "Focal Point" news show. He stated 
that Lubbers would have to be begged to do it if there was no 
other good candidate. 
  The alternative is Martens himself, who is counting on 
Lubbers. "I have always been able to count on the faithful 
support and appreciation of Ruud Lubbers, and I am extremely 
grateful for it," he said. 
  The Netherlands prime minister did not give anything away 
during the "Focal Point" program. It remains up in the air 
whether or not he is giving up on the top European position in 
Brussels. However, Lubbers has never officially submitted his 
candidacy. He came out in favor of Martens, but pointed out 
that there were "several" candidates who could take over the 
reins from Delors. 
  Current Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene refused to 
make any comment on Martens' candidacy. Moreover, he was quiet 
about his own chances. Newspaper reports claim that Dehaene is 
supposedly the first choice of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
French President Francois Mitterrand. 
  The successor of Delors, who will officially take office on 
1 
January next year, will be decided at the end of June during the 
semiannual European summit conference on the Greek island of 
Corfu. So far, only British European Commissioner Sir Leon 
Brittan has officially been nominated as a candidate by the 
British Government in London.

  [Text] The European Union [EU] welcomes the agreements 
initialed in Moscow on 15 March between Latvia and Russia on the 
withdrawal of Russian troops by 31 August 1994 and social 
guarantees for serving and retired Russian military personnel in 
Latvia, and the agreement on the arrangements for the Skrunda

important step towards achieving the complete withdrawal of 
Russian troops from the Baltic states called for in the 1992 
CSCE Helsinki document, and towards the establishment of good,

  In the same spirit, the European Union expects that Russia 
will complete its troop withdrawal from Estonia by 31 August 
1994.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy Gets Good Marks on Correcting </F>
Public Accounts"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 20 Mar (ANSA) -- A report drawn up by 
experts at the European Commission has given Italy good marks in 
its efforts to right public finance over the past two years and 
urged Rome to speed up its time-table to cut the deficit in 
order not to compromise the significant progress made in 
reducing interests rates. 
  The report, which the European Union [EU] executive is 
slated 
to examine Wednesday [23 March], came also on the eve of 
Monday's meeting of the EU Finance Council, at which the 
ministers will discuss budget reform and fines against Italy for 
having surpassed its assigned milk quotas, the amount of which 
could create new hurdles in Rome's attempts to right its 
accounts. 
  The report for the European Commission stated how Italy had 
made marked progress in improving its primary surplus, assets 
net of deficit interest costs, and underscored how the 
withdrawal of the Italian lira from the European Monetary System 
(EMS) had permitted interest rates to come down sharply and thus 
contributed to keeping the global debt in line with programmed 
objectives. 
  Even though interest rates are expected to remain low, the 
report continued, "the persistence of a risk premium towards 
another European Union Member State makes it necessary to speed 
up the process of reducing the deficit and thus avoid a trend 
reversal for the factors needed to correct finance." 
  After stressing how the progress made so far to correct 
finances but continue in 1994 and beyond, the report underscored 
how last year represented a turning point for the initiation of 
the long-awaited privatization program which was now producing 
concrete results. 
  The income from the privatization operations were calculated 
in the report at 5 percent of the gross domestic product but, 
the report added, a significant portion will be absorbed by the 
necessary operations to restructure and thus the total impact of 
privatization for the reduction of the deficit will be very 
small. 
  Other important achievements made by Italy and cited in the 
report included the reduction of inflation, to 4.2 percent in 
1993, and the reduction in labor costs of half a percentage 
point which, together with the devaluation of the lira, allowed 
Italian enterprises to become more competitive. 
  The report from the European Commission went on to observe 
how the full application of structural reforms for public 
employment, health care and local finances will allow the 
Italian economy to rest on more solid foundations towards 
European convergence. Suggestions and guidelines were also made 
in the report for the future and included rigorously sticking to 
the process to right public finance in order to thus stabilize 
and then reduce the pressure of the deficit on the GDP. 
  Inflation, the report added, must continue to decline and 
the 
gap must be reduced between Italy's inflation rate and that of 
the average of the European Union, now around 2.5 percent. 
  In the context of a healthy recovery with growth for the 
economy and employment, the report concluded, aside from 
progress towards convergence, there must also be not only a wage 
policy which keeps inflation in check and a budget policy aimed 
at righting finance, but also a monetary policy which ensures 
exchange stability.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nuclear Research: Future of </F>
European Research Reactors Fails To Impress"; from Brussels 
EUROPE ENVIRONMENT] 
  [Text] Belgian attempts to guarantee a future for its 
experimental nuclear reactor at Mol by making the European Union 
[EU] responsible for its survival appear to have been scuppered, 
at least for the moment. The draft Council Resolution on the 
subject submitted to the Council of Ministers' Research/Atomic 
Questions Group during the Belgian Presidency has been struck 
off the agenda of the March 4 Research Council after the United 
Kingdom, Germany and Ireland insisted this was a problem for the 
individual reactor operators to handle, not the EU. The draft 
Resolution would need unanimous Council support to be adopted. 
  The proposed text arguably seeks to kill at least two birds 
with one stone. Belgium has never been happy about the 
perceived unfair competition from the EU-funded Joint Research 
Centre experimental reactor in Petten, the Netherlands, whose 
costs -- decommissioning for example -- are calculated on a 
somewhat different basis from those of Mol. 
  The proposal argues that the viability of test reactors (and 
EU research reactors in general) depends on finding a long-term 
solution for the problem of initial fuel supply and final waste 
disposal. Some observers suggest that turning fuel supply into 
a Union responsibility could be seen as an attempt by Belgium to 
encourage the EU to allow Russia to sell its cheap nuclear fuel 
on the EU market. Belgium, with its large nuclear industry but 
no domestic nuclear fuel production, would be the obvious 
beneficiary. 
  The Commission is currently negotiating a new Euratom 
Agreement on behalf of the EU with the United States on nuclear 
materials trade and services amid an international tussle over 
whether the United States should take back the spent enriched 
uranium it has been supplying to research reactors in Belgium, 
Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and 
Switzerland. 
  The main problem area of the Euratom Agreement negotiations 
concerns the U.S. demand that it should be able to monitor the 
movements of nuclear material of U.S. origin within the EU -- a 
proposals which the EU adamantly refuses to countenance. The 
proposed text for the Resolution nevertheless includes a clause 
stating that the Commission should highlight the importance of 
finding a solution for disposing of radioactive waste from 
European experimental reactors in its negotiations with 
Washington. 
  EU Energy Commissioner Abel Matutes is expected to take up 
the issue of consent rights with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher at a meeting in March.

<F P=106> [Andrew Grice and Michael Prescott report: "Tories Want </F>
Stronger Euro-veto for UK"] 
  [Text] A confidential survey of grassroots Conservative 
opinion shows overwhelming opposition to any watering down of 
Britain's powers to veto European Community legislation. 
Instead, a majority of Tory activists actually wants the 
government's blocking powers to be increased. 
  The Central Office survey of 3,400 Tory party members across 
Britain has been leaked to THE SUNDAY TIMES and its findings 
sent to John Major and Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. 
  Further evidence of Tory opposition to any dilution of 
Britain's remaining sovereignty comes from a poll of 70 
backbench Conservative MPs, conducted by THE SUNDAY TIMES over 
the past three days. This shows a 3-1 majority against any 
change in the present voting system in the EC Council of 
Ministers, the [European] Union's key decision-making body. 
  Both surveys will increase party pressure on Hurd not to 
give 
ground at a critical meeting of European foreign ministers in 
Brussels on Tuesday [22 March]. 
  This has been called to find a way out of the voting rights 
crisis caused by the EC's pending enlargement from 12 to 16 
countries following the accession of Norway, Sweden, Finland and 
Austria scheduled for next January. 
  One leading Euro-sceptic MP said yesterday that Major would 
be forced to resign as prime minister if Britain climbed down on 
the issue. Major would be challenged for the party leadership 
in November, he said. 
  "If this does not come out right, the bulk of the 
Conservative party might feel that John Major no longer served 
any useful purpose." 
  Britain has 10 votes out of 76 under the current system of 
voting and 23 are needed for a blocking minority. When Austria 
and the Scandinavian countries join, the total number of votes 
will rise to 90 and the number required for a veto -- if Britain 
yields -- will rise to 27. 
  Britain and Spain want the blocking minority to remain at 23 
but are under intense pressure from the other 10 countries. 
  The cabinet has authorised Hurd to make some concessions 
because, without unanimous agreement, accession of the four new 
members will be at risk 
  The confidential Central Office report on 400 group 
discussions on European policy records "a substantial majority" 
in favour of larger countries, including Britain, having more 
voting power at the expense of smaller countries. A small 
majority favoured giving Britain "additional rights of veto." 
  Tory activists in Major's Huntingdon constituency said the 
voting system should be based on financial contributions, giving 
Britain and other large countries permanent membership on a new 
governing body, reducing smaller countries to rotating 
membership. 
  The survey was conducted by the Conservative Political 
Centre, the Tory think-tank, to test grassroots opinion before 
the European Parliament elections this June. 
  Surprisingly, Tory leaders are urged to minimise attacks on 
Labour and fight a positive campaign. This reflects fears that 
a negative campaign would result in a low turnout damaging the 
party's prospects. 
  In THE SUNDAY TIMES poll 48 Tory MPs rejected any increase 
in 
the existing blocking minority, while 17 said it should be 
raised in the interests of the Union's enlargement. There were 
five "don't knows." 
  Tory MPs are reserving their judgment on whether they will 
vote against the necessary legislation this autumn. Eight said 
they would vote against the enlargement bill if Britain's right 
of veto was reduced; 17 would support the bill, one would 
abstain and 44 said they "could not say" at present. 
  Tory MPs who took part in THE SUNDAY TIMES survey said 
preserving Britain's existing power of veto would prove popular 
with the public. "We either make a stand or we will have a 
federal Europe," said Sir Rhodes Boyson, a member of the 1922 
committee executive. 
  John Carlisle, MP for Luton North, said: "The government has 
got to stand absolutely firm at 23 votes. Any move from that, 
even to 23.5 would be a defeat." 
  Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, said: "The government is telling 
us that it is standing firm at the moment. A lot of people are 
very doubtful about that." 
  Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, denied 
yesterday that the Tory party was split over Europe. He told 
BBC radio: "What there is in every party is a debate, and it is 
unthinkable with historic change of these proportions taking 
place there shouldn't be a debate." 
  Tory sensitivity on Europe is shown by the refusal of party 
managers to allow a debate at next weekend's meeting of the 
party's central council in Plymouth. 
  Five local Tory associations have submitted motions to the 
conference in defiance of a ruling that none will be accepted.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Global Warming"] </F>
  [Text] The world's first treaty on combating the threat of 
global warming -- one of two conventions agreed at the 1992 Rio 
Earth Summit -- becomes international law today. Last Wednesday 
[16 March] in Geneva, 80 countries also reached broad consensus 
on setting up the Global Environment Facility [GEF], a $2 
billion fund to help developing countries pursue this goal. 
  These agreements represent some of the past decade's most 
ambitious attempts to tackle global "green" concerns. However, 
neither the treaty nor the fund come close to a solution. 
  The global warming hypothesis is that increasing amounts of 
"greenhouse gases" in the atmosphere -- particularly carbon 
dioxide -- will cause the planet to warm. Scientists say that 
it may take decades to establish or reject this theory 
conclusively. Nor will it be clear for years whether, if 
warming is occurring, its effects are damaging or beneficial. 
  Rio set out to find ways of curbing growth in emissions of 
these gases, in case the hypothesis proves correct. However the 
treaty, in the much-amended version which finally received 
agreement, requires signatories only to draw up plans for 
curbing emissions, not to make actual cuts. 
  The GEF is also unlikely to do more than scratch the surface 
of its task, given the small size of its budget and the dozens 
of countries petitioning for a share. 
  In practice, devising a workable agreement on curbing 
emissions is likely to be impossible. First, policing such 
agreements is hard since emissions are difficult to monitor. 
Second, countries will be tempted to renege, particularly if 
they are convinced that they will benefit from other countries' 
continued observation of the rules. 
  The greatest obstacle, however, is securing agreement on the 
distribution of cuts in emissions between different countries, 
given that any deep cuts are more than likely to slow economic 
growth. Developed countries see the rapid projected growth in 
emissions in China and India -- and in Russia should its economy 
revive -- as the greatest threat to atmospheric stability. 
However developing countries may reasonably respond that the 
present atmospheric concentration of these gases comes from 
industrialised countries, which will continue to supply the bulk 
of emissions for years. 
  A more fruitful route may be to pursue the co-ordinated 
removal of subsidies to fossil fuels, particularly coal, which 
would also encourage energy efficiency. 
  Countries should also redirect their time and money towards 
considering how to mitigate the effects of climate change if it 
occurs. That could mean changing agricultural patterns, or even 
building dams around low-lying regions in case sea levels rise. 
  Governments showed at Rio that they wanted to take 
precautionary steps while global warming remains a potential but 
unproven hazard. These two approaches -- eliminating subsidies 
and mitigating the effects of climate change -- should provide 
the way ahead.

<F P=106> [Anthony Bevins exclusive report: "Dublin Bids To Win IRA </F>
Ceasefire"] 
  [Text] Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring has broken with 
the Anglo-Irish demand that there can be no peace moves with 
Sinn Fein until the IRA agrees a permanent cessation of violence 
. 
  Mr Spring said in an interview that the Dublin Government 
would want to build on a temporary IRA ceasefire to help Sinn 
Fein "inch away from violence." 
  A Sinn Fein leader has told THE OBSERVER that if talks were 
on offer, he believed the IRA "would react quite positively." 
Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein's vice-president, said: "Obviously, 
it's an opening up of the whole peace scenario, and it is to be 
welcomed, and it is to be explored and built upon." 
  He added: "If we see a real and genuine possibility of a 
serious, all-encompassing peace process developing, then Sinn 
Fein would be prepared -- in the correct scenario, without 
preconditions being laid down -- to go to the IRA and put it to 
them that they should facilitate this development." 
  That had happened before, during the secret 1992 contacts 
between British Government go-betweens and Sinn Fein, when the 
IRA had been asked for, and had offered, a 10-day ceasefire. 
  If a temporary ceasefire did break the current deadlock, it 
could help Dublin and Sinn Fein by-pass John Major, who appears 
politically paralysed by his reliance on the Commons votes of 
the Ulster Unionist Party [UUP], given the Government's slender 
majority. 
  But Mr Doherty insisted that in the last analysis, Mr Major 
was the problem. 
  "It is the British Government that holds the power and has 
the authority and no matter how well-meaning Dublin may be, 
that's the reality that Sinn Fein has to look at. If they had 
the political will, they could deliver." 
  Nevertheless, if an IRA ceasefire became more enduring as a 
result of Dublin talks, it is possible that troops could be 
withdrawn to barracks -- because they are only on Ulster's 
streets in response to the terrorist threat. 
  In his interview with NEW CENTURY, a new left-wing 
quarterly, 
Mr Spring said he did not see any short-term dramatic 
development that would allow Sinn Fein to become involved in the 
political process because, for that to happen, the IRA would 
have "to put down the guns." 
  He then said: "I see violence withering away rather than 
being guillotined." 
  But he added: "I believe Sinn Fein is inching away from 
violence. I am not even sure that they know what they are 
inching towards. But I do believe they are inching away from 
violence." 
  Mr Doherty told THE OBSERVER: "I am talking about inching 
forward towards peace. As we inch towards peace, we have to 
take on board the fact that there is violence coming from all 
quarters; not just the IRA." 
  Mr Spring said in his interview: "I think they will try to 
work out some kind of modus operandi that allows them to get 
into political debate with Irish political parties before having 
to make any concession to the British, before halting the 
violence. We have to guard against that." 
  But he then added: "I think it is possible they will offer 
some temporary cessation of violence in order to sit down round 
the table with other nationalist parties. 
  ``They haven't done that yet, either publicly or privately, 
but it seems that's the way their strategy is working. That's 
going to pose a bit of a dilemma. 
  ``If they offer a temporary ceasefire we will want to find a 
way of building on that without making any concessions to them. 
  ``All these processes are slow and painstaking, nothing is 
going to happen that suddenly says to people, `It's over. Now 
you can start to live your lives properly.''' Mr Doherty said 
of the possible link between a temporary ceasefire and talks: 
``I think Sinn Fein would take it very seriously, but I could 
not predict or tell you now what the outcome of that would be.... 
  ``If it's serious and if it is perceived as moving the peace 
process forward, I think that all that would be looked at 
extremely seriously.'' 
  Meanwhile, James Molyneaux, the Unionist leader, told a 
Belfast meeting of his party council yesterday that December's 
Downing Street declaration had run its course. 
  It had been suggested that the declaration could be 
developed 
or built on, and that it was only a starting point, but Mr 
Molyneaux said: "You can't hang much on a dead Christmas tree." 
  However, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Secretary of State for Northern 
Ireland, told a Conservative meeting in Sussex that the 
declaration embodied fundamental principles of constitutional 
and political reality. 
  "They are principles that will endure. They are not 
dependent on acceptance or rejection by Sinn Fein and the IRA. 
  ``For the two governments to have declared their common 
acceptance of them is an event of historic significance. 
  ``They are now recommitting themselves to the political 
talks 
process which the Joint Declaration complements and underpins.'' 
  But the interview with NEW CENTURY, to be published at 
Easter, indicates that Dublin is still pursuing its own peace 
agenda; the Heathrow attacks and continuing murders in the North 
have not killed off their efforts to construct other 
opportunities.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] Criticism by [Social 
Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf] Scharping regarding Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel's summons of French Ambassador Francois 
Scheer to the Foreign Ministry met with heated contradiction 
from the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. According to 
the Social Democratic Party [SDP] chairman, Kinkel must "take 
along some putty" when he goes to Paris soon. Kinkel permitted 
his behavior toward the French ambassador last week to be 
determined solely by domestic policy reasons, Scharping said. 
  FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer accused Scharping of the 
"foul creation of legends." The summons of the French envoy was 
"appropriate and necessary." It is dishonest that Scharping now 
tries to turn this into ammunition for the election campaign, 
Hoyer said.

  [Excerpt] Potsdam (DPA) -- After the collapse of the 
Potsdam coalition between the Social Democratic Party [SPD], 
Free Democratic Party [FDP], and Alliance 90, the SPD and the 
FDP have concluded an agreement about the continuation of their 
coalition. SPD Landtag Group Chairman Wolfgang Birthler said on 
Wednesday morning [23 March] that the current course of the 
government will be continued. Speaking to the Landtag, Minister 
President Manfred Stolpe (SPD), too, stressed that the Cabinet 
is able to function. He did not rule out early new elections, 
but a decision will be made by parliament. Normally, a new 
Landtag would be elected on 11 September. 
  The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Landtag group, which is 
in opposition, announced that it will not tolerate a minority 
SPD-FDP government. New elections must provide clear conditions 
in the land, CDU Group Chairman Dieter Helm said. He will 
suggest to his group to put forward a motion for parliament to 
dissolve itself on Wednesday if possible. Helm accused Stolpe 
of trying to get by an "untenable situation" in an undemocratic 
way. The CDU will not, however, put forward a motion for 
no-confidence vote. 
  The Party of Democratic Socialism group wants to decide at a 
special meeting this evening whether it will put forward a 
motion for new elections in parliament. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The special representative for 
rationalization measures within the Bundeswehr, General Lorenz 
Huber, has asked for his dismissal. The Defense Ministry 
confirmed the step of the 57-year-old general today. As DPA 
learned, he cited lacking support for his proposed austerity 
measures by senior generals as the reason for his departure. 
The Defense Ministry announced that no decision has yet been 
made regarding Huber's request. The defense expert of the 
Christian Democratic Union, Paul Breuer, demanded the 
"unconditional examination of all of Huber's proposals and a 
clarification of the circumstances that prompted Huber to take 
this personal step." Juergen Koppelin from the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany spoke of a "serious warning" for Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union). [passage

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- In the view of Bundeswehr Inspector 
General Klaus Naumann, participation in foreign operations 
including all duties is essential to strengthen the Bundeswehr's 
marred public image. As far as risk-sharing is concerned, 
Germany can no longer claim a special role in Europe, Naumann 
said at the WELT AM SONNTAG-sponsored Bundeswehr-Forum in Berlin 
on Tuesday [22 March]. The Bundeswehr must be able to assume 
all the tasks that are asked of it within the framework of NATO, 
the Western European Union, and UN missions. 
  In practice there cannot be a clear dividing line between 
humanitarian, peacekeeping, or peace-making operations. Anyone 
who withdraws his troops because one of these tasks cannot be 
clearly carried out is making a "clown of international 
politics" out of himself. He is no longer able to make people 
understand why, given Albania's permission, a German warship is 
unable for constitutional reasons to enter Albanian territorial 
waters to identify a foreign ship while implementing the embargo 
against the rump Yugoslavia. On 19 April, the Federal 
Constitutional Court will discuss these controversial foreign 
missions. 
  Naumann sharply rejected the de facto equal treatment of 
military service and alternative civilian service, particularly 
since the Constitutional Court emphasized the precedence of 
military service. Only 5-10 percent of those doing alternative 
service were doing really hard work in social institutions, 
while the rest were rather enjoying privileges compared with 
doing military service, Naumann said. The inspector general 
then gave assurances that he was intending to implement 
consistently the recently presented report on cost restrictions 
regarding the operations of the Armed Forces.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Federal Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, hopes that the 
visit to Germany by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' "will 
mark the beginning of intensifying bilateral economic 
relations." Rexrodt said that, apart from the developments of 
the Middle East peace process, his one-hour talk with Al-Shar' 
in Bonn on Friday [18 March] focussed on the possibilities for 
developing German-Syrian economic ties. 
  According to Rexrodt, Syrian exports to Germany totalled 
1.12 
billion German marks [DM] and were twice as high as German 
exports to Syria (DM546 million). The reason for the high 
Syrian trade balance surplus are Germany's oil imports from 
Syria. In the first 11 months of 1993, Germany's exports to 
Syria grew by 25 percent over the same period in the previous 
year, while imports from Syria only increased by 6 percent.

  [Text] Kiel (DPA) -- At the local elections the voters in 
Schleswig-Holstein turned their backs on the right-wing 
extremist parties. Even though the Republikaner improved their 
results in their bastion Luebeck from 3.1 to 4.1 percent, only 
0.5 percent of voters voted for them across the land. Thus, 
Schoenhuber's party lost almost half of its voters in 
Schleswig-Holstein (1990: 0.9 percent). At the Landtag 
election in 1992 1.2 percent of the votes cast their votes for 
the Republikaner. In general, the right-wing extremist parties 
were of such little importance at these local elections because 
they ran only in a few towns and districts. 
  Just as four years ago, the National Democratic Party of 
Germany (NPD) did not play any role. The German People's Union 
(DVU), which entered the Kiel Landtag with six deputies at the 
previous Landtag elections, did not run for the local elections 
in the first place. 
  The Republikaner ran only in Luebeck and in the 
Rendburgs-Eckernfoerde district. The NPD ran in 23 
constituencies in the Lauenburg Duchy district and received 2.8 
percent of the votes there. At the communal elections in the 
towns that belong to a kreis [district], the two parties did not 
run at all. 
  In Moelln, too, where in 1992 two young men from the 
skinhead 
scene had killed three Turks in an arson attack, none of the 
right-wing extremist parties stood for election. In 1990 the 
Republikaner received 3 percent of the votes there.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- In the view of Norbert 
Walter, chief economist of Deutsche Bank, the Bundesbank's 
monetary policy is not in harmony with the fundamental national 
economic data. In a contribution to FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE 
SONNTAGSZEITUNG, Walter writes about potential explanations for 
the Bundesbank's restraint regarding a further lowering of the 
interest rates -- fear of inflation by the guardians of the 
currency or concern about the drain of money from Germany -- 
that wage contracts have been surprisingly low. Inflation is on 
the retreat; the German mark is strong compared to the dollar, 
the yen, and European currencies. 
  Walter asks whether the interim goal -- maintaining a given 
growth of the money supply -- has not become an "obsession," 
while "trends and predictable factors for future inflation rates 
may perhaps signal success on the inflation front and thus for 
the Bundesbank goals?" 
  The final goal, price stability, "is right around the 
corner." In this connection, he criticized the measuring of 
money supply growth by the Bundesbank as "a pointless procedure 
of calculating an annual rate for this volatile unit." "The 
Bundesbank must not become the prisoner of its partly self-made 
gap in credibility," Walter says. 
  Furthermore, Walter writes that German and European economic 
development needs a normal interest-structure curve with money 
market rates, which are at least 1.5 percentage points below 
capital market rates. Real interests for the economy, which 
lead to financing costs of 6 percent (Germany) and 8 percent 
(France), cause restraint in investments.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Several participants and policemen 
were injured during a demonstration of about 2,000 Kurds in 
Berlin on Saturday afternoon [19 March]. At least three 
demonstrators sustained burns from gasoline canisters, the 
General Students' Committee of the Technical University, one of 
the organizers, announced. According to the police, several 
policemen were injured in riots. Preliminary reports say that 
four demonstrators were arrested. 
  According to the police registration, the Kurds' protest was 
aimed against the Turkish state. The participants in the 
demonstration in the West Belin inner city shouted "stop the 
genocide" and "German weapons out of Kurdistan." In the evening 
the protest march was supposed to end with a rally in 
Breitscheid Square.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Hundreds of Kurds on Tuesday [22 
March] blocked several highways in the FRG and thus caused a 
traffic jam. In Hesse, Lower Saxony, Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
Berlin, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, and Bremen, 
Kurds blocked highways and caused traffic to come to a 
standstill. 
  Several dozen Kurds blocked the highway near Giessen and 
Frankfurt around noon. According to the traffic news, a similar 
action took place on the Frankfurt-Darmstadt highway. On the 
highway at the former Dreilinden checkpoint near Berlin, 
approximately 60 demonstrators set fire to car tires. The 
traffic came to a standstill in both directions. In the area of 
Cologne, traffic jams of several kilometers formed after 
blockades. More than 200 Kurds obstructed the traffic on the A 
27 highway in Bremen and the A 7 highway near Northeim (Lower 
Saxony). According to the police in Breman, gasoline was 
spilled on the road. 
  The most violent clashes with Kurds since the ban of the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK, four months ago had taken place 
only on the weekend. Up to 6,000 Kurds occupied the 
Munich-Stuttgart highway for nine hours on Saturday. On Monday 
evening, several thousand Kurds demonstrated in German cities on 
the occasion of the Kurdish spring festival "Nevruz."

  [Excerpt] Hamburg -- There was violence and a traffic jam 
when Kurds blocked several highways in various laenders on 
Tuesday [22 March]. The traffic was blocked, car tires were set 
on fire, and stones thrown at police officers. Several Kurds 
poured gasoline all over themselves and set themselves on fire. 
Several others threatened to burn themselves. Numerous people 
were injured and over 100 persons arrested. 
  In Hesse alone, 120 Kurds were arrested. According to police 
reports, they had come in private cars and a bus. The arrested 
persons have been charged with breach of the peace, dangerous 
bodily injury, duress, and dangerous obstruction of road

  [Text] Berlin -- In view of the Kurdish riots in the past 
few days, Friedrich Bohl (Christian Democratic Union), chief of 
the Federal Chancellery, has called for the swift deportation of 
Kurdish offenders. In an interview with SAT 1 this morning, 
Bohl stated that the Federal Government has made efforts to 
intervene in the Turkish-Kurdish conflict within the framework 
of what is possible. However, Germany cannot accept "violent 
actions on German soil to settle the inner-Turkish conflict at 
the expense of German citizens." Bohl stressed: "We must adopt 
tough measures to prevent that." 
  The deportation of Kurdish offenders is possible because 
they 
are not facing persecution "in all parts of Turkey." Bohl 
expressed the hope that the majority of the Kurds living in 
Germany ensures that the reputation of the Kurds in Germany is 
not damaged.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- At a demonstration against the 
right-wing extremist Republikaner in Stuttgart on Friday [18 
March] evening three policemen were injured by thrown stones. 
Two of the men had to be hospitalized. They sustained head and 
rib injuries. Another policeman had to receive outpatient 
treatment for a hand injury, according to the police. 
  In the course of the demonstration, which had not been 
registered, about 80 participants were temporarily detained. 
Twenty of them are investigated for offenses against the law 
relating to civil disorders and rioting, the other 60 were 
detained so as to prevent further criminal acts. The protest 
was directed against the party's anniversary ball, celebrating 
its 10th anniversary in the Liederhalle congress center. 
  Among other things, two windows of the congress center were 
broken by thrown stones. Furthermore, the windows of several 
police cars were destroyed and seven buses were damaged. 
According to the police, about 200 people had gathered in front 
of the congress center. The mostly young demonstrators, some of 
whom wore masks and were "ready for violence," toppled garbage 
cans and built barricades with them. 
  The approximately 200 members of the protection and criminal 
police who were on-site were able to push the protesters away. 
There were no physical clashes between the police and the 
demonstrators. The Socialist Left FORWARD [Sozialistische Linke 
VORAN] had called for the rally.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "United Nations: Andreatta on </F>
Peacekeeping Operations"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 22 -- The United Nations has been 
aiming too high with its peacemaking and peacekeeping operations 
which in 1993 ended up with partial successes and some failures, 
said Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta on Tuesday [22 March]. 
The United Nations "probably expected too much. It has tried 
to carry out operations without sufficient experience," 
Andreatta told a meeting of representatives from religious news 
agencies. 
  "The 1993 results, the result of (UN Secretary General 
Butrus) Butrus-Ghali's pride in organising peace forces to 
rebuild public well-being and order, to rebuild countries, has 
ended in very partial successes. And in some cases in failure," 
the foreign minister was quoted as saying in a text released 
after his appearance. Andreatta accused the United Nations of 
attempting peacekeeping operations "without sufficient 
experience; it has sent troops with somewhat precarious chiefs 
of staff. But on the whole it seems to me that it meant well." 
  As Italian troops concluded their pull-out from Somalia, 
which they are leaving with all the other Western contingents 
there, Andreatta painted a bleak picture for that East African 
nation, saying that without an organised state it is difficult 
to imagine justice, development or respect for human life. "You 
cannot expect to transfer the democratic state model of Western 
industrial powers with no perception of anthropological 
complications, as Americans of good will but little experience 
often do," said Andreatta. "This is the problem that the 
experiences of the Butrus-Ghali secretariat will leave to the 
United Nations," the foreign minister said. 
  Despite setbacks for UN operations, he concluded, failure to 
intervene in crisis points would not put the situation to right. 
"It would seem to me to be a mistake," he concluded, "on the 
basis of these initial experiences, to suggest that the world 
community should not take an interest in those parts of the 
world where all legal power has disappeared, and where anarchy 
reigns supreme."

<F P=106> [Report by Daria Gorodisky: "Fini: Split in North Is </F>
Bossi's Fault"] 
  [Excerpts] Milan -- "If the anti-Occhetto [secretary of the 
Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] front is split in the north, 
the fault lies with the lamentable selfishness not of the 
League, but of [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi, who 
refused to accept the AN [National Alliance] in the pole of 
freedoms." Speaking in Milan yesterday, [AN leader] Gianfranco 
Fini did not tire of saying so to the crowd that filled piazza 
del Duomo (almost 20,000 people), and to reporters, both Italian 
and foreign, curious to observe this new Italian Right. 
[passage omitted] 
  Fini is convinced that a large proportion of League voters 
will support the AN this time and that in any case, "since the 
League is a regional phenomenon, it cannot impose conditions." 
  But Fini wanted to discuss other matters. He was keen to 
stress that the national and social Right is ready to govern: 
"This is the only new factor in Italian politics, whereas the 
Left is an exacerbated repetition of what has been done for the 
past 30 years." We must beware, therefore, because "politics has 
been dominated by the Center-Left for the past 30 years. If 
Occhetto wins, we will have a Left-Center coalition government." 
  The danger, Fini said, comes not from the Right, but from 
Occhetto's men (who, in the guise of progressives, in fact 
"favor the major industrial groups to the detriment of small and 
medium enterprises. There can be no economic development under 
the PDS") and "from the specters of [Mino] Martinazzoli's 
[secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI] and [Pact for 
Italy leader] Mario Segni's center, who want to help to 
establish a government of left-wing forces." The MSI [Italian 
Social Movement] secretary stressed that this center is 
"ambiguous because it has sought unacceptable allies such as La 
Malfa [Italian Republican Party Secretary]. We thought had 
disappeared without trace, like former Prime Minister Amato, 
champion of antisocial policies, and that Jurassic relic of the 
First Republic that answers to the name of Zanone [Italian 
Liberal Party]. We may yet have to report them to the police 
for attempting to restore the five-party alliance." In the 
evening, however, he added in Genoa that "poor Martinazzoli is 
aware now that he is bound to emerge the loser and, at the same 
time as he rules out an accord with the Right, he shows that he 
has already decided to reach an agreement with the Left." With 
regard to the election results, Fini is sure that the AN "will 
go well beyond 10 percent." And if the pole of freedoms were to 
win, could Bossi-Attila ("who is still shouting about 
corruption, but who has taken bribes, even though he blames it 
on some idiot just passing through") become crucial to the 
formation of a government? "This, on two conditions," Fini 
said: "clarity on the issue of national unity and identity and 
on the duties of a policy of solidarity between north and south 
and between the strong and weak sectors of society." [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mafia Controls 350-400,000 Sicilian </F>
Votes, Study Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Palermo, March 22 -- Sicilian Mafia gangs 
number about 45,000 in Sicily and handle and control about 100 
trillion lire (60 billion dollars) a year from drug trafficking, 
smuggling, extortion and public contracting, a study carried by 
the local branch of the Eurispes political and social research 
institute said here today. 
  According to Eurispes, 350-400,000 votes, or about ten 
percent of the Sicilian electorate are controlled by Cosa 
Nostra, and about the same proportion of the island's elective 
offices, through its 130 "families" each with 150-300 members. 
  The study said that the simple magnitude of the revenue 
passing through Mafia organisations implies a need for financial 
services and brokering to handle it -- and, at the same time, an 
ability to exert pressure and influence decisions wherever the 
mafiosi are active. 
  The study, which also confirmed that the Mafia is creating 
"bridge-heads in Europe and East Europe," reported that Italian 
organised crime as a whole boasts an an army of about 500,000 of 
whom about 100,000 are professionals and the others ready for 
the occasional job. 
  Of the Mafia, the study said about 20 percent of its revenue 
comes from public contracting, which fits in well with figures 
from the Sicilian Audit Court claiming that tendering 
regulations are violated in 67 percent of all the public 
contracts signed in the region. 
  The figures showed that over 26 trillion lire are invested 
in 
Sicilian public works contracts each year, with 14 trillion 
going to local councils. Sicily's regional government is the 
one that spends most in Italy, with an annual budget of almost 
3.5 trillion lire a year. 
  "Today," said Eurispes Chairman Gian Maria Fara, "Cosa 
Nostra 
and other Mafia organisations control significant slices of 
public life and the national as well as the southern market. 
  ``If the Mafia has a political dimension, it is because it 
has managed to adapt to a service society, infiltrating various 
sectors of local government and administration. Multiplying the 
sources of expenditure has also opened new panoramas for Mafia 
activities to take root.''

  The number of privatization operations carried out by ENI on 
Thursday [17 March] reached 48 with the sale of its interest in 
Liquipibigas to Novogas, for 245 billion lire, and Enichem 
synthesis interests to Great Lakes chemicals of the United

  Overall, ENI so far has sold off is participation in 
companies, plants and real estate for an overall earning of 4 
trillion lire and involving some 11 thousand employees. 
  ENI has carried out its privatization operations based on 
competitive auctions, publicized both at home and abroad with 
appraisals given by the world's leading specialized institutions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italia Telecom Mergers Set on Their </F>
Way"] 
  [Text] Rome, 19 Mar (ANSA) -- The creation of Telecom 
Italia [TI], the new Italian telecom giant which will group all 
present public-sector telecom interests in a single company 
scheduled for a stock market flotation by the end of the year in 
one of the biggest privatisation sell-offs ever, got on the road 
today when various share swap operations were approved for TI's 
future component parts. 
  Meeting to approve their annual accounts, five companies 
from 
the IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] stable -- SIP 
[Italian State-Owned Telephone Company], Italcable, Iritel, SIRM 
[Italian Maritime Radio Company] and Telespazio -- agreed to the 
complex swap mechanism. The final vote on the merger should be 
approved at shareholders' meetings in mid-May. 
  Yesterday, the government set some guidelines for the 
flotation. They included the assignment of a "golden share" to 
institutional investors without any telecom interests and a 
ceiling on individual stakes "much lower" than the three percent 
set for the Banca Commerciale and Credito Italiano. 
  After the meeting, the forecast was that the flotation could 
be ready in the autumn. Reliable estimates of Telecom Italia's 
sale value will only be available when the official consultants 
make their assessment known. 
  For STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company], the holding 
company which controls IRI's telecom interests and will control 
Telecom when it has been created, last year's market 
capitalisation was 21-23 trillion lire (12-13 billion dollars) 
of which IRI has about 52-53 percent. The flotation will be 
achieved by putting STET on the market. 
  Yesterday, too, reliable sources said that, in what one 
commentator described as a "hot weekend" for moves to re-draw 
the Italian telecom map, the government was now hoping to name 
the second GSM portable phone licence holder -- there is now a 
SIP monopoly -- early next week, or at least before the 
elections next weekend. 
  The further developments expected in May and after the 
Summer 
represent the end to a saga that began 6 years ago. The debate 
on grouping IRI's telecom interests under a single roof began in 
March 1988. A major step in December 1992 was the passage of 
ASST [State Telephone Services Agency], the state-owned 
telephone service company which handled a slice of international 
traffic, to newly created Iritel. 
  Further outlines in TI's profile were sketched in on April 2 
1993, when a ministerial committee said the public stake could 
be reduced "gradually below the threshold of 51 percent" and 
required a separation between the future group's telecom and 
manufacturing activities. Details of the whole operation were 
released last September. At about the same time, IRI set up 
Tecnitel to handle STET's manufacturing activities. 
  According to a plan released on February 4 by STET Chairman 
Michele Tedeschi in a letter to the directors of the companies 
to be merged into TI, the new telecom giant will be divided into 
seven divisions under the strategic control of the streamlined 
corporate structure. With the corporate holding overseeing 
general strategy and seeing to it that there is no overlapping 
in the services provided by the various sectors, Telecom 
Italia's various divisions will function in the fields of 
private clients, business clients, international services, 
mobile phones and satellite communications. These sectors will 
be flanked by divisions dealing with the telecommunications 
network and with services. 
  SIP marked today's new progress towards Telecom Italia by 
announcing record profits of 657.4 billion lire (390 million 
dollars), 42.7 percent up on 1992 and the highest announced by 
any Italian company for last year. The telephone company said 
it would pay ordinary stock a dividend up from 75 to 85 lire and 
savings shares one up from 95 to 105 lire. The year's accounts 
also saw net indebtedness reduced by 1.1 trillion lire (660 
million dollars). SIP, whose shares have been outperforming most 
other stock on the Milanese bourse for months, produced few 
figures that were not some sort of record. 
  Pre-tax profits were up 47.4 percent to 1.470 trillion lire, 
debt dropped for the first time below revenue to give a ratio of

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the Spanish </F>
People's Party, by Ettore Botti in Madrid; date not given: 
"Time Is Up for Gonzalez"] 
  [Excerpts] Madrid -- The Spanish Socialists' congress has 
come to an end. As expected, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has 
once again been reelected to the leadership of the PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers' Party]. However, though taken for granted, 
this outcome was only reached through a compromise -- unexpected 
as regards its proportions -- with rival Alfonso Guerra, who 
leads the party's left wing. [passage omitted] 
  [Botti] Do you believe that this was Gonzalez' last congress 
as prime minister? 
  [Aznar] The last, the second last... I cannot tell. What I 
do know, however, is that the Socialist cycle has come to an end. 
  [Botti] Why has it come to an end? 
  [Aznar] Because the congress has ratified Gonzalez' power, 
leaving the basic problems unresolved. The majority of young, 
urban voters are now voting for us, that is, for the PP 
[People's Party]. The PSOE is backed by those who are not so 
young, and those who depend on the state's apparatus. After all 
these years, people are tired of this way of governing. The 
Socialists should be replacing their ideological platform with a 
pragmatic one, but they are incapable of changing. 
  [Botti] What mistakes has Gonzalez made in his capacity as 
head of government? 
  [Aznar] In a favorable context, he had every opportunity to 
transform Spain, but he failed to seize any of them. He gave 
rise to a number of irregular practices, which generate mistrust 
and pessimism. He failed to link Spain to Europe's more 
developed countries. 
  [Botti] What is your opponent's greatest fault? 
  [Aznar] I do not like to make personal judgments. If you 
wish me to mention a fault, I might say he is inconsistent. 
  [Botti] Do you think that an analogy can be established 
between the PSI's [Italian Socialist Party] collapse in Italy 
and the PSOE's present difficulties? 
  [Aznar] I think that the problem concerns all Socialists in 
Mediterranean countries generally. Socialism had its last 
stronghold in southern Europe, in France, Greece, and Portugal, 
apart from Italy and our own country. In all cases it has 
evidenced a strong tendency to conflict, and a similar 
conception of power, which has given rise to corruption. 
  [Botti] Has corruption in Spain reached the same levels as 
in 
Italy? 
  [Aznar] I hope not, but it is certainly widespread here, and 
patronage is too. This mechanism that generates public 
expenditure in order to win votes has seriously contributed to 
worsening the state's deficit. 
  [Botti] Do you think a "manos limpias" [clean hands] enquiry 
is required? 
  [Aznar] I do not think that there will be one, and I am not 
advocating one either. It is preferable for regeneration to 
take place through a political change. 
  [Botti] Meaning through you and your PP? 
  [Aznar] It is up to the Spanish people to decide. However, 
the European elections will be very important. 
  [Botti] Would you rather be considered a center or a 
right-wing man? 
  [Aznar] A center man, whose party covers the entire 
center-right area. 
  [Botti] Do you believe anything can be salvaged from 
Francoism? 
  [Aznar] Nothing is left today of that period. It is a page 
in history, and in terms of the people's will, that has now been 
definitely turned. 
  [Botti] What is your answer to those who accuse you of not 
having the stature of a leader? 
  [Aznar] Leaders are created by citizens. Last year 8,200,000 
people voted for me, and 9 million for Gonzalez, but I believe 
that our votes are qualitatively better. 
  [Botti] The fact remains that the center-right is in power 
in 
France, England, and Germany, whereas it did not win in Spain. 
Why is this so? 
  [Aznar] Because of the resistance shown by Mediterranean 
socialism, as I mentioned earlier. However, sooner or later we 
will win -- that much is certain -- and it still remains to be 
seen whether this legislature will reach the end of its term. 
Generally speaking, the problem lies in the fact that 
governments become worn out, and the need for renewal is felt. 
Just as in France people were fed up with the Socialists, in 
Germany people may get tired of [Chancellor] Kohl -- 
irrespective of whether parties are on the Right or the Left. 
  [Botti] Who will win in Italy, though? 
  [Aznar] Who knows! I hope that the Left does not win. The 
pole of freedom has possibilities, but I think that it still has 
to solve some internal problems. The new Popular Party still 
has a long way to go. I hope that it will undergo the same 
change that we have carried out. 
  [Botti] What is your opinion of [Forza Italia leader Silvio] 
Berlusconi? 
  [Aznar] Many businessmen turn to politics, but becoming a 
politician in the first person requires extraordinary devotion 
and capabilities. It is very difficult to be a businessman and 
a politician at the same time. 
  [Botti] Whom would you vote for? 
  [Aznar] I do not feel I can express a preference. However, I 
wish our Popular Party namesakes all the best. [passage omitted]

energy specialists took a training course at the Goesgen power 
station in Soleure Canton last week. The Swiss Association for 
Atomic Energy disclosed on Monday [21 March] that the training 
focused primarily on the security procedures at West European 
nuclear power stations. 
  The nuclear power plant operated by the five Ukrainian 
guests 
is located 150 km north of Odessa. It comprises three reactor 
units with a capacity of approximately 1,000 megawatts. As far 
as technology is concerned, it is similar to the Goesgen reactor.

  [Text] Wettingen, 21 Mar (ATS) -- The National Cooperative 
Company for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (Cedra) and the 
Swedish company in charge of the disposal of nuclear fuel (SKB) 
have decided to strengthen their cooperation. Both partners 
signed a research and development agreement on Monday [21 
March], according to Cedra. This four-year agreement will make 
it possible to conduct research activities in two laboratories, 
one on Sweden's Aspoe Island, the other in Grimsel, Switzerland. 
  In Grimsel, Cedra has been operating a laboratory 450 meters 
below the Juchlistock summit. With this agreement, both 
countries will reinforce and enhance the existing scientific 
relations, Cedra said. Scientists will establish new safety 
measures with a view to applying them at disposal sites.

<F P=106> [Interview with Democracy Party Deputy Nizamettin Toguc by </F>
Guido Olimpio in Italy; date not given: "Turkey: Six Kurdish 
Deputies May Face Capital Punishment" -- first two paragraphs 
are CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] 
  [Text] Turkey is stepping up the pressure on the Kurds. 
Six DEP [Democratic Party] deputies have been stripped of 
parliamentary immunity and imprisoned. The Army has unleashed 
harsh repressive measures in the Kurdistan region in order to 
block the offensive which the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
-- the anti-Ankara guerrilla movement -- is expected to launch 
in the spring. 
  Nizamettin Toguc, DEP deputy for the Batman region, stated: 
"My six colleagues are risking the death sentence, and are 
being treated like members of a terrorist group. Their sole 
crime is having stood up for the Kurds." After being seriously 
wounded in a terrorist attack last September, Toguc is now in 
Italy to publicize his people's tragedy. 
  [Olimpio] Is the Turkish Government's hard line inspired by 
the military? 
  [Toguc] That is correct. The generals have never stopped 
meddling in politics and have brought a lot of pressure to bear 
on the authorities. It was the Security Council that drove 
parliament to deprive the deputies of their immunity. 
  [Olimpio] Is Turkish Prime Minister Mrs. Tansu Ciller again 
playing the Kurdish trump to offset internal problems? 
  [Toguc] The government is grappling with a profound crisis. 
The state's coffers are empty, particularly because of the war 
in Kurdistan. The government is in the difficult position of 
having to demand further sacrifices from the people, and having 
to meet the military's requests for more funds. 
  [Olimpio] What do you think of the upcoming local elections? 
  [Toguc] If these had been free elections, we would have 
supported them wholeheartedly. However, in order to prevent us 
from taking part in the vote, the state has attacked the DEP. 
Dozens of activists have been arrested, bombs have been planted 
in the various parties' headquarters, and candidates have been 
intimidated. This is why the DEP has decided not to take part 
in the elections, and has requested the people to abstain. 
[Toguc ends] 
  An even harder line was adopted by the PKK, which warned 
candidates not to run in the elections: "Those who do not obey 
this order, will pay a high price," came the message. The 
resistance's dictate was accompanied by a diplomatic offensive 
which led PKK leader Abdullah Farhat's brother Farhat Ocalan to 
Moscow. According to Lebanese sources, Farhat was received by 
head of foreign counterintelligence Primakov, who promised to 
provide support and weapons.

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, Brussels] </F>
  [Text] European foreign ministers today failed to breach 
the log-jam over voting rights which has brought turmoil to 
plans to enlarge the Union and left Britain all but isolated. 
  The talks in Brussels were adjourned until Saturday [26 
March] when the 12 foreign ministers, including Britain's 
Douglas Hurd, will meet in Ioannina, Greece, in a renewed bid to 
heal the rift. 
  But today, Mr Hurd emerged from the meeting insisting that 
the talks had not collapsed and that Britain remained "at the 
heart of Europe." 
  The crisis hinges on the number of votes needed to block 
European decisions once the European Union [EU] is enlarged from 
12 to 16 next January with the addition of Sweden, Norway, 
Finland and Austria. 
  The refusal by Britain and Spain to adapt the voting rules 
has triggered the current stand-off which leaves Britain 
ominously isolated and has become a major distraction for the 
Conservative Party in the run up to Euro elections in June. 
  At present EU nations have to muster a total of 23 votes out 
of the 76 available to block a contentious proposal which means 
at least three of the 12 member states must vote together 
against any proposition. 
  The new proposals increase the total votes to 90 with the 
four new members and seek to raise the number needed for a veto 
to 27. 
  Mr Hurd had arrived in Brussels saying he was not seeking to 
"torpedo" enlargement plans but would not be "hustled" into any 
agreement which was not in British interests.

  [Excerpts] Earlier this month Austria, Sweden, Finland, and 
Norway -- the latter with some delay -- decided to join the 
European Union [EU]. But this enlargement of the Europe of 12 to 
the Europe of 16 requires a reform of the institutions of the 
Union. In addition, the future of the blocking minority in 
decisionmaking will have to be determined. [passage omitted] 
Jean-Michel Mostart has met Belgian Foreign Minister Willy 
Claes, who doubts the entry of the four nations in the Union on 
1 January 1995 will take place as scheduled. Willy Claes thinks 
Europe is losing its credibility: 
  [Begin Claes recording] We are losing some of our 
credibility, externally and internally. Last Friday I was in 
Washington. There I met colleagues who belong to governments 
that are candidates for membership. They said to me that they 
failed to understand any of our talks, and, above all, the 
opponents of the European Community in their countries will take 
advantage and launch a likely successful campaign. This is the 
external aspect. As for the internal aspect, I would like to 
see some parliaments looking again into their position vis-a-vis 
this European construction. Once again, I have the feeling that 
this is not just a detail, but a discussion on principles that 
are the basis of the fundamental orientation of Europe of the 
future. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>
  [Text] Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring today left the 
Brussels talks on voting rights -- challenging Britain to change 
its "illogical position." Mr Spring said it was not a walkout, 
but he had to be back in Dublin tonight for a cabinet meeting. 
  An Irish Government spokesman admitted: "He would have 
stayed 
longer if he had thought there was any chance of reaching 
agreement today." Mr Spring said the failure to decide the 
balance of voting in the enlarged European Union was a failure 
of leadership. "This is not the best example to be giving. We 
may well be running out of time." 
  He said there was no sign at all of a compromise by Britain 
and Spain -- both fighting to keep the "blocking minority" vote 
at 23 -- and the other 10 -- insisting it must increase to 27. 
  "I have difficulty understanding the British position," said 
Mr Spring. "If we don't resolve this then we will be facing a 
very difficult situation. Positions have not changed today," 
added Mr Spring. 
  He left the talks after an inconclusive lunch between the 
foreign ministers and amid signs of a tougher stand on both 
sides. Officials said Britain was pressing for a "protocol" 
formally limiting the blocking minority vote to 23. 
  In what was seen as a sign of growing frustration Holland, 
Belgium and Luxembourg retaliated with a threat to hold the 
"qualified majority" at 54. 
  This would neatly turn the tables on Mr Hurd by demanding a 
freeze at present levels on the voting balance in favour instead 
of against Euro legislation. The effect would be to make 
agreements easier -- and push up the "blocking minority" to 37. 
  Mr Spring said he hoped to see signs of compromise from 
Britain when foreign ministers meet in Greece at the weekend. 
Other member states were talking of imposing a two-week 
deadline on Britain to give Mr Hurd a breathing space to talk 
the Tory Euro sceptics round to what is seen as inevitable -- a 
legal requirement for a new "blocking minority" of 27.

<F P=106> [Interview with Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso by </F>
Pedro Oliveira in Brussels--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Unidentified announcer] The enlargement of the 
European Union [EU] reached deadlock today with the entry of the 
four new members being vetoed by Britain and Spain, who fear 
losing the capacity to block decisions. Over to our Brussels 
correspondent Pedro Oliveira: 
  [Begin recording] [Oliveira] [passage omitted] Everything 
has 
been postponed to next weekend's meeting in Ioannina, Greece, 
where the EU foreign ministers will have their last chance to 
avert a crisis. [passage omitted] 
  There is a possibility of adding political appendices which 
would meet the objections of Britain and Spain, but these would 
have no formal legal guarantees, and London and Madrid want 
guarantees. Britain actually wants population sizes taken into 
account -- the large versus the small, in other words. Portugal 
is adamantly against this: 
  [Barroso] Any compromises introduced at this stage taking 
population figures into account, lending greater weight to the 
larger countries, cannot and will on no account be accepted by 
Portugal. 
  [Oliveira] Durao Barroso thinks London and Madrid are being 
unrealistic if they think the other 10 members will change their 
mind. [passage omitted] The Portuguese foreign minister is 
averse to additional protocols and amendments, but admits that 
there may be a political way out. 
  [Barroso] We are open to a binding compromise of a political 
nature, provided that -- and I repeat -- no idea of 
discrimination among the member states is brought in through the 
back door. [end recording]

  [Text] The European Union enlargement issue remains 
deadlocked. Britain's and Spain's disagreement with the other 
Community partners over minority blocking rights continued after 
another day of tense negotiations. The compromise proposals did 
not work. The next attempt will be made at the weekend in 
Greece. 
  [Brussels correspondent Julio Bernardez] The struggle of 10 
versus two, or the minority blocking votes battle, is still a 
draw. Nobody has changed their minds. And all are thinking 
about a solution next weekend in Greece. However Spanish 
Minister Solana is not optimistic at all. 
  The formal meeting lasted an hour and a half, the time 
needed 
for each to outline his position; a position that was already 
known anyhow. Seeing the result, President Pangalos ended the 
meeting amid general disappointment. 
  [Begin Javier Solana recording] Spain, as you know, is in 
favor of enlargement. We are also in favor of finding a formula 
in the institutional area which will protect our interests, with 
an efficient mechanism that will work. That is what we have 
stood for and that is the position we will continue to defend. 
[end recording] 
  [Bernardez] Delors was disappointed and he has promised that 
our country will see the fires of hell. France and Germany, 
however, played a conciliatory role because they know that the 
alternative is a serious crisis in the European Union.

<F P=106> ["mbe"-signed report on interview with Jean Pierre Cot, </F>
chairman of the Social Democratic Party group in the European 
Parliament, in Brussels on 21 March: "The Final Word on 
Enlargement Has Not Yet Been Said in the Union"] 
  [Text] According to Jean Pierre Cot, chairman of the 
Social Democratic Party group in the European Parliament (SPE), 
the European Parliament's [EP] agreement to enlarge the European 
Union [EU] by admitting Finland, Norway, Austria, and Sweden is 
at risk. 
  In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, Cot criticized the EU 
states of causing a "confidence crisis" in parliament. With a 
view to the EU foreign ministers' meeting on Tuesday [22 March], 
intended to settle the week-long internal dispute on the future 
weight of votes in the Council of Ministers after an 
enlargement, he warns the Twelve particularly against giving in 
to British pressure and leaving the blocking minority at 23 
votes. 
  The Parliament would not accept that the differences of 
opinion regarding the voting practice in the Council are 
"patched up," the chairman of the strongest group (198 deputies) 
in the Strasbourg parliament said. "It will not be enough to 
satisfy the positions of one or the other or to find ambiguous 
formulas that would make it possible for (British Foreign 
Secretary -- the editors) Mr. Hurd to save face." 
  Should the blocking minority of 23 votes for ballots with a 
qualified majority in the Council be maintained, then the 
already tiresome decisionmaking process in the Union would 
become even more difficult. According to Cot, the British 
Government has meanwhile openly admitted "that it will indeed 
try to use enlargement to trim Europe's sails, keep it on its 
course, and keep the specter of `federalism' at bay." 
Parliament was firmly determined "not to accept such a change 
of course. Raising the blocking minority from 23 to 27 votes is 
the absolute minimum Parliament can accept!" 
  Regardless of the controversy about the blocking minority, 
Cot believes that there are numerous other factors that might 
make it impossible for the member of the European Parliament to 
vote in favor of the membership agreement scheduled for 4 May. 
For months, the "negative signals" from the Council of 
Ministers to the address of the European deputies have 
increased: The suggestion to make the sessions of the Council of 
Ministers more "clear" has fallen on deaf ears; among other 
things, the member states reject "any discussion" on democratic 
control in connection with intensifying judicial and police 
cooperation; the issue of the rights of parliamentary 
sub-committees has also been blocked; moreover, several member 
states have upheld the "threat to reverse achievements in common 
foreign policy under the cover of subsidiarity." 
  Similar to Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros 
Pangalos, a few days ago Cot conceded that it might have been a 
mistake to enlarge the Union first and later deepen it. Cot 
emphasized that, only after long hesitation, Parliament 
abandoned its original demand to carry out institutional reform 
of the Union before enlarging it. This order was opted for 
ultimately, among other things, to signal to the membership 
candidates that they are welcome in the Union. 
  For Cot, "the EU states have fallen behind their obligations 
under the Maastricht Treaty to consolidate the Union. On the 
contrary, the Twelve initially accepted a creeping process of 
disintegration, which has now been clearly confirmed by the 
British foreign secretary." To return to the right course, 
moving up the date of the government conference on examining the 
Maastricht Treaty, scheduled for 1996, could be considered "to 
discuss all pending issues right now." However, this would put 
at risk enlargement, scheduled for early 1995. 
  If the EU foreign ministers indeed wanted to save the entry 
round, they would have to make sure "that the decisionmaking 
processes in the Union are not weakened. The Council of 
Ministers must undertake clear political obligation to the 
necessity of institutional reform. Without such a commitment 
there can be no enlargement!"

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock </F>
by Elmar Oberhauser -- live] 
  [Text] [Oberhauser] Dr. Mock, it was reported from 
Brussels before your arrival here that you are dismayed and 
concerned about this development [dispute in European Union over 
blocking minority]. Does this mean resignation? 
  [Mock] It certainly does not mean resignation. There have 
been crises in the European Union [EU] in the past, but one must 
not regard it too lightly either. The atmosphere among the 12 
member states is becoming increasingly difficult. We have a 
situation where the four rounds of negotiations with Norway, 
Sweden, Finland, and Austria have been concluded, and this 
cannot, so to speak, be used because there is a dispute between 
the 12 over the minority vote and the necessary number of votes. 
Therefore, I appealed very vigorously to President Pangalos. I 
said that we had come to Brussels three times. This was no 
joke. We noted three times that an agreement was not achieved. 
There is more at stake than a little more influence of one or 
another member state. However, I must say it is my impression 
that the majority of the EU states, excepting Spain and Britain, 
are resolutely sticking to their position, the position of the 
treaty. 
  [Oberhauser] You are not the only one who has expressed 
dismay and concern. Let me put it like this: Kinkel, 
professional optimist and German foreign minister, says he is no 
longer prepared to predict whether the January 1995 entry date 
for the four members that one is striving for can be maintained. 
Do you think that it is still realistic? There are only a few 
days left. President Klepsch said on this program a few days ago 
that the whole thing has to be settled by early April. 
  [Mock] I also had a long talk with Klepsch today and he 
assured me that the ratification proceedings could be compressed 
if the parliamentary groups agree. In that case, he thinks it 
is still possible. Actually, he was more optimistic than the 
members of the Commission, above all President Delors, or the 
members of the Council of Ministers. There they are openly 
talking about a possible major crisis. 
  [Oberhauser] Why are the Britons so stubborn in this 
question? 
  [Mock] You see, it is a fact that, in contrast to the 
general assumption, the voting rights of the medium-sized and 
small states are very strong. One must not forget that, when it 
becomes a member, Austria will have four votes in the Council of 
Ministers. We have more than 7 million inhabitants. Germany, 
with 80 million, has 10 votes. Britian is very concerned. It 
sees the danger that it will be at too much of a disadvantage, 
that it will have to pay a big country's share into the budget 
and to bear responsibility in many other respects, and that the 
medium-sized and small states will have too much say in 
determining the political course -- it cannot be that bad 
because otherwise the French and the Germans would also be 
concerned about it -- which is not the case. This is special 
behavior by the British, who always supported us in our efforts 
for membership. 
  Thus, one really has to say that the whole thing is very 
complicated. 
  [Oberhauser] You are a diplomat and -- I put it like this -- 
in Britain your party friends, the conservatives, are in power. 
Is there no opportunity to talk to the Britons on this level? 
They sit together with you in the European Democratic Union, 
for example. Or have there been negotiations on this level that 
have not been successful? 
  [Mock] I assure you telephone conversations have been going 
back and forward all the time, not only with one's own party 
friends, but across party lines. It is an eminently political 
question, however, and it has also become somewhat a question of 
prestige. Therefore, there is a great danger the date for the 
ratification of the treaty will be missed. This problem will 
certainly also be solved. 
  In the days when De Gaulle vetoed England's entry and on 
another occasion De Gaulle refused to go to Brussels no 
government member went to Brussels for six months. The EU even 
survived that. We are not here to deal with crises, however; we 
want to act. 
  [Oberhauser] When you have talks, for example, with Prime 
Minister Major.... 
  [Mock] Yes? 
  [Oberhauser] Once again, how much chance is there of 
achieving the result you are striving for before this deadline? 
  [Mock] Let us say fifty-fifty. You have rightly said that 
these are speculations. Next Saturday and Sunday, the ministers 
will meet in Greece with the new applicants for membership with 
whom the negotiations have been concluded. For the first time, 
we will participate in a Council of Ministers meeting. It would 
be somewhat macabre if one had to state on that occasion that we 
have lost one year. This crisis will also be solved, but the 
question is at what cost. 
  [Oberhauser] However, Pangalos, Greek minister for European 
affairs, said a few days ago that it is a mistake to go ahead 
with this enlargement now. Is this not a background against 
which there is little hope for the whole thing? 
  [Mock] I would say that the number of those -- I do not 
number Pangalos among them -- who believe that the EU should not 
be enlarged further is increasing. The problems are increasing 
and are becoming more difficult. This is what I always meant 
when I talked of a window. Either one manages to become a 
member or one will not manage it for a very long time. Last 
week, a Norwegian diplomat told me the following: If we had 
signed in 1972, it would have been far cheaper for us. Spain 
became a member before Norway and made demands regarding fishing 
waters. I do not want Austria to be forced to negotiate again 
when perhaps the Czech Republic or Poland make demands because 
they also want to become members. 
  [Oberhauser] One final question, Mr. Foreign Minister: If 
all goes smoothly in Greece on Saturday, you will say that all 
has worked out well and nothing has happened. If all is not 
well, however, and the entry date of January 1995 for which one 
is striving cannot be maintained, what will be the consequences 
in terms of substance for Austria's efforts? For example, what 
effects do you expect on the mood of the population? 
  [Mock] There will definitely be a certain disappointment. 
There is no doubt about it. However, if the objective is 
considered as worthwhile, one has to continue one's efforts. 
Today, compared with 1955, this treaty has been called the new 
state treaty for Austria. In those days, one traveled to Berlin 
and Moscow for 10 years. We did not have to travel for such a 
long time to get it this time. Unfortunately, we now have to 
watch how the creators of the EU are unable to come to agreement 
on one point. They will come to agreement, hopefully very soon. 
  [Oberhauser] That is to say, your readiness to continue to 
travel to Brussels, if necessary, is unchecked? 
  [Mock] Yes. 
  [Oberhauser] Thank you for having been our guest.

<F P=106> [Wim Brummelman report: "Serious Threat of Major Crisis in </F>
EU"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Theodore Pangalos (55), the Greek 
minister of European affairs, is currently heading up the 
revolving presidency of the European Union. Day after day and 
night after night, he carries on an endless series of dialogues 
in Brussels, making every effort to convince his interlocutors 
with reasonable arguments. As president of the negotiations, he 
had to tolerate how his impatient German colleague, Klaus 
Kinkel, took over the reins and, sometimes rudely, put pressure 
on those who would obstruct taking on board Norway, Sweden, 
Finland, and Austria as new EU member states. 
  Now, however, it looks as if the planned enlargement of the 
European Union by 1 January 1995 is a big mistake and a big 
misunderstanding. Pangalos himself thinks that this is the 
case. The EU would have been better off with an internal 
reorganization aimed at making mutual cooperation stronger, and 
not taking on any new members until the end of the decade, the 
minister said this week, just after returning to Greek soil. 
  Has Pangalos gone crazy? Or is he right? The intended 
enlargement to include Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria had 
already caused deep splits in the EU, even before the European 
Parliament had received all the texts of the agreements. Great 
Britain and Spain are mercilessly threatening to explode an 
institutional time bomb with their refusal to give up any of 
their voting weight in an enlarged Union. [British Prime 
Minister] Major can hardly make a move, hunted as he is by the 
Euroskeptics in his own rank and file and the media, which never 
stops recalling the glory days of former Prime Minister 
Thatcher, who, all on her own, had the rest of Europe on its 
knees in the debate on reimbursing EC contributions. 
  On the continent itself, the reliable Franco-German axis has 
shown signs of overheating, following the controversial 
statements made by the French ambassador in Bonn concerning the 
all too assertive role which Germany wants to play in Europe. 
Elsewhere, too, distrust is raising its head. "Germany wants 
to complete the enlargement of the EU as soon as possible so 
that it can seize its opportunities in Central and East Europe." 
That is how Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans interpreted 
Kinkel's enthusiasm in Brussels. 
  So what happens now with the enlargement? Diplomats in 
Brussels have no idea how the impasse over the "blocking 
minority" during the decisionmaking process -- i.e., should it 
be 23 or 27 votes in the EU? -- can be resolved by next Tuesday 
when the foreign ministers of the 12 EU member states meet 
again. Various formulas are making the rounds whereby the 
decisionmaking process would be interrupted for, say, two months 
in order to reach a consensus, but so far this looks like it has 
little chance of succeeding. 
  This means that there is a real threat of an enormous 
crisis, 
and this seems to prove Pangalos even more correct. It would 
have been better if the EU had given itself more time to 
"digest" the Maastricht Treaty. The European Commission also 
felt that first there should have been talks on "deepening" and 
then enlarging the Union, but the European heads of government 
decided otherwise at their summit in Lisbon in the summer of 
1992, recalled a Commission spokesman suddenly when asked for a 
reaction to Pangalos' statements. 
  That decision in Lisbon can be attributed to the amazing 
outcome of the first Danish referendum in spring 1992. 
President Delors' plans to produce "a political, intellectual, 
and institutional shock" with his report on the impact of the EU 
enlargement were quickly consigned to oblivion. Nobody needed a 
shock. So instead, Great Britain got all the support for 
recommending that enlargement negotiations should begin as soon 
as possible, without first discussing the institutional 
adjustments. London feels that the larger the Union, the more 
noncommittal the cooperation. 
  The remarkable thing is that Great Britain is now provoking 
an institutional discussion through demanding more 
decisionmaking weight as a large member state, and thus is 
threatening to block the enlargement. This is precisely the 
reason why Germany is keeping its powder dry and wants to wait 
until the intergovernmental conference in 1996 before tabling 
its claim for more weight in the European Council of Ministers. 
Bonn first wants to ensure that the enlargement is secure, and 
then lean back and advance the thesis that 10 votes for 80 
million inhabitants is not very much, compared to the 10 votes 
which, say, France and England, each have for around 58 million 
inhabitants in their countries. 
  Pangalos -- the man who made the wrong decision - still has 
the task of finding a way out of the impasse next week, with the 
help, of course, of the always obliging Kinkel.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Commission Deputy Chairman Sir Leon </F>
Brittan by Milos Sklenka in Brussels; date not given: "An 
Application for Admission to the EU Is Only a Partial Step 
Towards Full Membership" -- first paragraph is editorial 
introduction] 
  [Text] The admission proceedings aimed at the expansion of 
the European Union [EU] by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway 
have not yet been completed, and new candidates -- Poland and 
Hungary -- are getting ready to knock on the "Brussels gates." 
A special HOSPODARSKE NOVINY correspondent in Brussels spoke 
with Sir Leon Brittan, the present deputy chairman of the 
European Commission and commissioner for trade, about the 
relations between the Twelve and the states of Central and East 
Europe and about the prospects for an eastward expansion of the 
EU. 
  [Sklenka] It has been frequently heard that, while on the 
one hand the EU officially calls for trade cooperation, on the 
other hand it closes its markets. Particularly now, at the time 
of an economic recession, criticism is often heard from the East 
of the protectionist trade policy not only of the Union but of 
all the advanced industrial countries in general. How does 
Brussels intend to help this region without harming the West 
European economies? 
  [Brittan] The liberation of trade exchange has increased 
markedly the volume of mutual trade, which undoubtedly can be 
regarded as favorable. At the same time, however, it burdened 
the balance of the East with a substantial deficit. From the 
point of view of stability in this part of Europe, this adverse 
trend is a very dangerous phenomenon. The EU endeavors to aid 
the economic and political transformation in Central and East 
Europe by all available means. Our hope is to reinforce 
concurrently political and economic relations in harmony with 
the integrated European policy of the Union that already 
incorporates the entire Central and East European region. 
  [Sklenka] Nevertheless, it seems as if the EU lacks a 
sufficiently clear strategy of expanding cooperation with 
Central and East European countries, a will to open itself more 
to these countries. 
  [Brittan] The development of any type of closer cooperation 
in the spheres of the economy, politics, trade, or culture is 
clearly defined in the association treaties and in the statement 
of last year's Copenhagen EU summit. To date, the Union has 
signed six of these treaties, and the Polish and Hungarian ones 
went into effect in February. It is well known that these 
documents, which are the first step of the associated states 
toward full membership in the EU, have an asymmetric character 
in the trade sphere, which gives an advantage to the East 
European countries. 
  [Sklenka] Under the present conditions of a global economic 
recession, however, the expansion of trade relations frequently 
leads to accusations raised against the East European countries 
by the EU of so-called social dumping, and their access to the 
markets is even hindered. 
  [Brittan] It is necessary to find a model of trade and 
economic cooperation that would enable East Europe to take 
advantage, above all, of its natural advantages resulting from 
low wages and production costs. On the other hand, the Union 
must protect itself against unfair competition, exports of 
commodities which frequently are subsidized disproportionately 
at home. This refers particularly to the so-called sensitive 
sphere, like agriculture, for instance, or steel and textile 
manufacture, where we are still searching for a common language. 
Under the conditions of an economic downturn and generally 
growing unemployment, exports of such items to the EU further 
disturb the generally valid principles of free economic 
competition in the common market, and therefore must be subject 
to antidumping arbitration, customs surcharges, or other forms 
of protection. 
  [Sklenka] Regarding the entry itself of these countries into 
the EU, is there a clear idea of their gradual integration into 
the Brussels organization? 
  [Brittan] The point of departure for the EU is the idea of 
building a joint federal Europe. Although for the time being we 
approach the East European states as a single group -- because 
under present circumstances and with respect to their past it 
simplifies and accelerates the process of joining the East with 
the EU -- the actual talks about the entry of each individual 
country undoubtedly will take place separately. It will depend 
a lot on their economic and social development. 
  [Sklenka] How important is the speed of submitting the 
official application? 
  [Brittan] The application for admission to the EU is only a 
partial step towards full membership. The acceptance of new EU 
members will not depend on the date of the application but 
rather on the readiness of the particular country, i.e., on the 
fulfillment of preset conditions beginning with the 
stabilization of a pluralistic democracy and a market economy 
through the observance of human rights and rights of ethnic 
minorities, reform of the present legislation, and ending with 
the fulfillment of the convergence macroeconomic criteria. It 
is obvious from this vantage point that the entry of these 
countries will probably differ in time. One can already see 
quite a marked difference in the progress of the reforms in the 
Czech Republic as compared to some other countries. 
  [Sklenka] The culminating talks on the expansion of the EU 
by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway indicate that the main 
problem remains, above all, the institutional questions. Is an 
estimate possible of the date for the expansion of the EU 
eastwards? 
  [Brittan] It is not the same thing to maintain the viability 
of the organization with 16 or 24 members as in its present 
12-member composition. One has to start from the assumption, 
however, that a start of any official talks regarding the entry 
of the East European countries is completely unrealistic before 
1966, when an EU intergovernmental conference will take place, 
which is to determine further proceeding in the expansion of the 
EU eastwards. Their admission as full members will be possible 
somewhere around the year 2000. Nevertheless, it cannot be 
ruled out that time will require the establishment of an 
intermediate stage between associate and full memberships for 
those who satisfy all the preset conditions first.

<F P=106> [Article by Rolf Falter: "`Jean-Luc Who' Has a Long Way To </F>
Go Before Occupying Delors's Seat -- Succession To European 
Commission Presidency Is Becoming Shadowboxing"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels -- Scarcely 10 days have passed since 
the rumor broke that Jean-Luc Dehaene is a leading candidate to 
succeed Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission 
on 1 January 1995. But, because the rumor seems to be based on 
a firm foundation of truth, the first intrigues and maneuvers 
have already started. The path of "Jean-Luc who" to Jacques 
Delors's seat is still long and sown with many ambushes. 
[passage omitted] 
  Formally the appointment of a new Commission president is 
the 
privilege of the council of heads of government and heads of 
state. However, there is no fixed procedure. Consequently the 
appointment is preceded by a long bout of shadowboxing, in which 
no one can get round France and Germany if they have made an 
agreement between themselves. 
  The new president's profile is a broad one. A vision of 
Europe is less important than the candidate's geographical and, 
to a lesser degree, ideological origin. It is a little like the 
appointment of the Swiss president. 
  Because the present Commission president is French and a 
socialist, his successor may not be the former and preferably 
not the latter either. This virtually rules out Denmark and 
Spain, where socialist governments are in power. There is 
little chance that they will put forward a candidate from their 
opposition. 
  Italy has little chance, because every candidate there risks 
being in a prison cell at the time when the call comes from 
Brussels. With Gaston Thorn, Luxembourg provided the Commission 
president before Delors. 
  Portugal has the ideal candidate in Prime Minister Cavaco 
Silva, who is actually a Christian Democrat, but whose party is 
simultaneously called "social democratic" and belongs to the 
European liberals. However, Lisbon did not put forward any 
claims. Ireland apparently gave up hope after former 
Commissioner Peter Sutherland went to the GATT. 
<H5>  Campaign </H5>
  At present there are four known candidates to succeed 
Delors. 
Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who is to resign after 
the parliamentary elections of 12 May in his country; his 
Belgian colleague Jean-Luc Dehaene; his predecessor Wilfried 
Martens, now president of the European Christian Democrats, and 
the British EU Commissioner Leon Brittan, once a minister under 
Margaret Thatcher. [passage omitted] 
  Martens is better known abroad than his successor, who was 
described by a journalist in THE TIMES last week as "Jean-Luc 
who?" But Dehaene could well be able to count on the support of 
Kohl and Mitterrand. 
  In addition there are even more political complications on 
the agenda in Belgium. Belgium's representative at the 
Commission is one of the portfolios which are divided on the 
basis of a proportional system when a new government is formed. 
If current Commissioner Karel Van Miert [Flemish Socialist 
Party] has to make way for Martens or Dehaene, then compensation 
must be provided. Senate Chairman Frank Swaelen's future is once 
again uncertain. 
  It is still early in the appointment race. It is presumably 
Helmut Kohl who is holding the finish flag. In addition it is 
unclear whether the agreement which he and Mitterrand made 10 
years ago when Delors was appointed, first a Frenchman, then a 
German, still applies. It is even more intriguing that Kohl, in 
a year when the German electorate will get rid of many CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union] politicians, has not yet put 
forward his own candidate. 
  Perhaps, because Germany has become so big and important in 
Europe, he will chose a non-German representative, which would 
explain why Kohl does not want Lubbers. Or has Dehaene been 
floated as a candidate to undercut Lubbers, the favorite? After 
which the latter flew Martens as a kite to trip up Dehaene? In 
any case, this story will continue.

  Austrian companies have been particularly active as far as 
the privatization of Hungarian enterprises is concerned. The 
State Privatization Agency has so far sold 328 major public 
enterprises for 176.3 billion forints (the equivalent of about 
21 billion schillings) to foreigners, of which Austrian 
investors have bought 96 enterprises for 43.8 billion forints 
(5.3 billion schillings) -- that is to say about 25 percent. 
  The managing president of the Hungarian Joint Venture 
Association, Ivan Toldy-Osz, told DIE PRESSE in Sopron that some 
18,000 joint ventures and 100 percent subsidiaries by foreign 
companies have been registered in Hungary. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Pistyan -- Despite the unstable domestic 
situation and despite the legal uncertainty in Slovakia, Austria 
is the biggest investor there. Of the approximately 4 billion 
schillings that have so far been invested by foreigners, about 1 
billion has come from Austria. About 25 percent of the 4,500 
joint ventures and subsidiaries in Slovakia are controlled or 
owned by Austrian enterprises, Katharina Dragschitz, deputy 
trade delegate to Bratislava, said at a symposium on 
Slovak-Austrian relations in Moravany near Pistyan. In 1993, 
Austrian exports amounted to 4.1 billion schillings while 
products worth 3 billion schillings were imported from Slovakia 
last year. 
  For Slovakia, Austria's accession to the European Union [EU] 
would be of major importance because Vienna supports the 
integration of East and Central Europe into the community, Jan 
Lisucha, state secretary in the Slovak Foreign Ministry, said. 
Austria was playing an important role for Slovakia in 
connection with other issues, too: Some embassies in Vienna are 
accredited for Slovakia, and many Western companies are dealing 
with the Slovak market via Vienna. Bilateral contacts in the 
spheres of culture, science, and the arts have intensified. 
However, new border checkpoints must be opened, Lisucha noted.

<F P=106> [Bjarne Nitovuori report: "Problem-Free in a United Europe"] </F>
  [Excerpt] From the point of view of security policy, 
Finnish membership in the European Union [EU] would be 
problem-free for Finland if Europe is integrated and we avoid 
repetition of the old two-way split. But if Europe is heading 
for a new split, as the conflicts in East Europe, the setbacks 
for reform in Russia, and signs of a nationalistic Russian 
foreign policy seem to indicate, then EU membership coupled with 
a military alignment will become problematic for Finland. That 
is the conclusion reached by the Foreign Policy Institute in a 
study carried out by researcher Jukka Salovaara on the effects 
of EU membership on foreign policy and security. The study also 
emphasizes that the effects of EU membership will also depend on 
Finland's alignment in defense policy and on the way Europe 
develops. 
<H5>  New Opportunities </H5>
  EU membership commits Finland to a common policy on foreign 
affairs and security, but only on such issues and areas of 
activity as have been agreed on jointly, Salovaara writes. 
This, in turn, opens up new foreign policy opportunities for 
Finland. Salovaara groups the opportunities of influencing the 
EU's common policy into three categories. 
  First, there are areas where EU policy is already very well 
established and where Finland has more to learn in order to be 
influential. These are mainly policies regarding the Middle 
East, but also those regarding the CSCE and the United Nations. 
Salovaara does not see any significant differences between 
Finland and the EU countries in policies regarding the CSCE or 
the United Nations. But he points to the example of Denmark, 
which, despite being in the EU, has been able to align with the 
other Nordic countries over South Africa, espousing a policy 
that differs from that of the other EU countries. It is 
therefore conceivable that the Nordic countries could cooperate 
over the United Nations as well in the future. 
  Second, there are areas where new accents will be added to 
EU 
policy, for example policies towards Russia and East Europe. EU 
membership would open up new activity areas for Finland within 
the framework of its policy toward Russia. 
  Third, Salovaara believes that, as an EU member, Finland 
will 
add a new Nordic dimension to the Union's foreign policy. This 
could increase the EU's interest in neighboring regions to the 
east of Finland. Finland cannot solve all its regional problems 
on its own. 
  If Finland stays outside the EU together with Norway and 
Sweden, Nordic cooperation can develop. If Sweden and Norway 
join the EU but Finland does not, its relations with Russia will 
gain greater emphasis. The difference, compared with the Cold 
War period, would be that West Europe's outer frontier would be 
drawn between Sweden and Finland. That would make Nordic 
cooperation difficult in its present form, the study maintains. 
  Salovaara deals with four alternatives in discussing 
Finland's defense, depending on whether Finland joins the EU or 
not and depending on Finland's military alignment or 
nonalignment. 
  If Finland does not join, neutrality is a likely 
alternative. 
One possible solution would be a defense alliance with Sweden if 
it, too, stays out of the EU. Salovaara does not see this as a 
likely eventuality in view of these countries' geopolitical 
situation and historical background. 
  Relations with Russia would then become of major concern 
because of our region's increasing military and strategic 
importance to Russia. This is because part of the Russian 
Baltic fleet has been forced to withdraw to St. Petersburg and 
the Kola peninsula now plays a more prominent role in Russian 
strategy. 
  As a member of the EU, Finland can stay militarily 
nonaligned 
and maintain an independent defense. The Maastricht treaty, 
however, points toward a common defense policy leading in future 
to a joint defense system. 
  The Foreign Policy Institute study, however, gives no answer 
to the question regarding the significance of a common defense 
policy. According to Salovaara, it is highly unlikely that any 
far-reaching decisions will be made at the government conference 
in 1995. He does believe, however, that the EU will be watching 
Finland closely after accession, mainly due to the long border 
that the Union would share with Russia after that event. 
  The foreign and security policy survey on the consequences 
of 
Finland's EU membership is one of the studies presented 
yesterday. There was another study on regional policy. [passage

<F P=106> [Katarina Koivisto report: "Bright Future -- But Only Within </F>
the EU"] 
  [Text] Joining the European Union [EU] is, from all points 
of view, more advantageous for Finland than staying outside, if 
one is to believe the studies presented yesterday. 
  These studies were commissioned by the government from 
various research institutes, but Foreign Trade Minister Pertti 
Salolainen (Conservative) was anxious to point out yesterday 
that the conclusions are those of the institutions, not the 
government. 
  EU membership will give new thrust to our economy and also 
boost employment. The study, carried out by the Industrial 
Research Institute [ETLA] on the economic effects of membership, 
indicates that, outside the EU, Finland would become a marginal 
region failing to attract many investors. Agriculture is 
recognized as a problem sector, but the same would be true if 
the country were to stay outside the EU. Integration is not a 
decisive factor in regional policy. The proper efforts of 
enterprises and the activities of the regions are more important. 
  The Foreign Policy Institute survey states that EU 
membership 
will not entail problems if Europe becomes integrated and a new 
split into two parts can be avoided. But a new two-way split 
could cause Finland problems if it is in the EU, but militarily 
uncommitted. 
  Minister Salolainen denies that the government has attempted 
to keep these studies secret or delay their publication. The 
idea was only to obtain a sufficient amount of information about 
the negotiation results to have a basis for the evaluation of 
the studies. 
  Finnish membership in the EU will give a positive new thrust 
to the country's economy. There will also be beneficial effects 
on employment after a transitional period. Outside the EU, 
Finland would become an economic fringe area in the far north, 
from which foreign investors will shy away. 
  Those are the views that Industrial Research Institute 
[ETLA] 
Director Pentti Vartia outlined to the parliament on Monday [14 
March] when he presented his researchers' reports on the subject 
of Finland and the EU. Vartia points out that there are certain 
economic differences between EEA [European Economic Area] and EU 
membership. One of the main differences is that, as an EU 
member, Finland must adapt to the EMU [European Monetary Union]. 
The consequences of this are currently being analyzed in detail 
in a separate study. But the decision to opt for the EU has a 
direct influence on businesses' inclination to invest; foreign 
investments here began to pick up the moment Finland decided to 
submit its application for membership. There are also direct 
effects on trade policy. The EU is a customs union focusing on 
a common trade policy, Vartia added. 
  He thinks that outside the EU, Finland would go back to its 
old patterns, the current structural changes would come to a 
halt, production and trade would focus on concentration more 
than competition, and the agricultural sector would return to 
its traditional forms of subsidy. ETLA's researchers point out 
that, outside the Union, we would not have the same opportunity 
to exert our influence as within. Trade and agriculture issues 
would affect Finland even if we were to stay outside the Union. 
As a member, at least we can make our voice heard and influence 
decisions: "Finland's influence within the EU is much greater 
than our size actually warrants," Vartia said. Membership is 
more likely to strengthen than weaken our sovereignty. Vartia 
stated that membership will actually cause only marginal changes 
to economic policy. There will be costs due to our share of the 
EU budget, but national and local budgets will remain the same. 
  Another consequence, if Finland were to stay outside the EU, 
would be that we could not participate in the EMU which, Vartia 
said, is a good anchor for economic policy. Within the EMU, 
there are fixed currency exchange rates, which is of special 
importance for smaller enterprises. EMU and a common currency 
can however cause problems for Finland, Vartia said. Our 
economy and the occasional disorders resulting from differences 
between exports and the domestic cost level have hitherto 
required measures such as currency rate adjustments. 
<H5>  Shared interests </H5>
  Only as a member of the Union can we ensure that Finnish 
products have free access to the European market, ETLA's 
researchers pointed out. Finland and the EU share the same 
interests in the main areas of trade policy. The EU as a region 
is far more protection-oriented than any of the individual 
member countries, Vartia added. "Only membership can offer 
Finland the opportunity of taking advantage of the Union's 
support program for countries like Russia, for example. As a 
member, we can get assistance with environmental projects in 
neighboring regions and benefit from our position as a gateway 
to the East," Vartia said. 
  Finnish taxation does not have to be changed if the country 
becomes a member of the EU. The EU has no right to collect 
taxes in individual member countries but it can propose measures 
of harmonization. The decisions must, however, be unanimous and 
Vartia gives greater credit to the prospect of fiscal 
competition where member countries, rather than increasing 
taxation, will vie for industries and manpower through lower 
taxes. 
  ETLA also sees an improvement in the employment situation if 
Finland joins the EU, rather than being content with EEA 
membership. Lower prices and costs will boost employment and 
improve our competitiveness, the reseach institute predicts. 
The Union will not, however, influence Finnish social security. 
What is true is that a country with a strong economy is in a 
better position to ensure the social welfare of its population 
than a poor one.

<F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vaisanen: "Ministry Finds More Areas To Be </F>
Subsidized Under EU's Category Six"] 
  [Excerpts] The Interior Ministry has found a lot of areas 
in Finland that meet the population density criterion for 
subsidies offered by the EU's [European Union] so-called [area 
category] six. [passage omitted] The additional areas are 
primarily regional communities that meet the criteria for both 
EU one and six subsidies. 
  The Ministry would still like Etela-Pohjanmaa to be a 
subsidized area. The province's population density is over the 
required limit, or more than eight inhabitants per square 
kilometer. On the other hand, the national product per 
inhabitant is under 75 percent of the average EU figure and the 
second-lowest in Finland. 
  The Ministry has also listed a couple of districts that are 
large in terms of number of people, which just barely exceed the 
eight-inhabitant limit: the Nivala (43,000 inhabitants) and 
Iisalmi (72,000) areas. Their gross naitonal product is under 
the 75-percent limit. 
  The districts of Pyhanta, Ii, Viitasaari, Kaustinen, 
Saarijarvi, Virrat, Nilsia, Sysma, Hankasalmi, Savitaipale, 
Liminka, Suonenjoki, and Keuruu are also new areas. If category 
six subsidies could be gotten for the entire area the Ministry 
plans to include, the subsidized area would cover 24.4 percent 
of the population. 
  At the beginning of the week the EU offered Finland a 
"category six subsidy," which is about 10-percent smaller, 
instead of the highest area subsidy. The subsidized area would 
be the same as the category one subsidy planned earlier, that 
is, Lapland, Kuusamo, Kainuu, Pohjois-Karjala, and Etela-Savo.

<F P=106> [Article by Marja Salmela and Anneli Tukia: "Countryside Is </F>
Being Vacated Otherwise Than Was Thought"] 
  [Excerpts] Oulu -- Accurate information puts Finns into 
square-kilometer map grid squares: 8,000 Finns live alone in a 
1-square-kilometer grid square. [passage omitted] 
  The Geography Department of the University of Oulu has 
refined its [demographic] grid system and is now capable of, for 
example, showing how Finland has been depopulated over the past 
20 years. 
<H5>  18,000 in One Square Km in Kallio </H5>
  "Rural areas were deserted at a frantic pace in the 1970's 
when the migration from country to town was at its peak. In the 
1980's this migration slowed down. At the same time, on the 
other hand, people were moving from the central areas of the big 
cities to communities near rural areas," Professor Arvo 
Naukkarinen pointed out. [passage omitted] 
  As concerns rural Finland, no more than 12 people per square 
kilometer live in the occupied squares of the grid. "A fifth of 
the inhabited area of the countryside is threatened with 
depopulation since no one under age 15 lives there any more," 
Assistant Professor Jarmo Rusanen fears. 
  People often think that only development areas, in eastern 
and northern Finland, become depopulated. Researchers point out 
that rural areas have been vacated throughout all of central 
Finland. Yla-Savo and the lake country of Finland, especially 
Mikkeli Province, have lost a lot of people. 
  Accurate information has surprisingly revealed that rapidly 
depleting rural areas are also found in southern Finland, in the 
Loimaa district, and in eastern Uusimaa. 
<H5>  Privacy Protected </H5>
  When one pokes at a base map with a sharpened pencil point 
and with one's eyes closed, one obtains accurate information. 
  If there are only a few inhabitants in a grid square, the 
information on them is not given to outsiders. "People's privacy 
is carefully protected," Asst. Prof. Jarmo Rusanen emphasized. 
<H5>  Cows or Nothing, Wheat or Nothing </H5>
  "The reason for the decrease in population in Loimaa and 
Yla-Savo may be the fact that both areas gambled on a single 
strength. Loimaa is Finland's grain center, while Yla-Savo is 
Finland's milk center. The specialized farms are mechanized -- 
that eliminated jobs," director Reijo Keranen of the Yla-Savo 
Institute surmised. 
  Nearly one out of every three jobs is in agriculture, that 
is, according to Naukkarinen, the situation is the same as it 
was in the 1960's throughout the country. 
  "The usual structural change has not occurred. Sidelines 
like 
farm tourism, berry cultivation, or farm equipment contracts 
have not been produced at the same rate as elsewhere." 
  Neither area has been able to industrialize or develop 
services either. 
  "Young people's alternatives have been cows or nothing in 
Yla-Savo and wheat or nothing in the Loimaa district." 
<H5>  One Can See Far Off in Finland's Grain Center, Like a Prairie </H5>
  Loimaa -- The heart of Finland's grain region, the Loimaa 
district, is like a prairie. Level expanses of fields stretch 
out in clear weather almost as far as the eye can see. 
  "From a suitable vantage point, you can see for 7 km," 
farmer 
Jorma Maki-Punto, 57, of the town of Loimaa said. He is the 10th 
owner of his family's farm located on the banks of the Loimi 
River. 
  Maki-Punto specializes in seed grain. He intends to plant 60 
hectares with it next spring. For additional income, he has two 
summer cottages "that keep me pretty busy." 
  The loose, porous fields of the clayey region customarily 
produce wheat, barley, and rye. Over the past few years 
compulsorily fallowed fields, which the eyes of the farmers at 
least are not used to, have increased. To them fallowing seems 
disagreeable and untidy. 
  The houses of the district are on average in prosperous 
circumstances, in the middle of and framed by the yard, erect, 
and well tended. People live in them too. The eye rarely falls 
on an iced-up window. 
  So far, the changes appear to be only a worsening of public 
services. Village stores, post offices, and banks are closed. 
The distances children have to be transported to get to schools 
have become longer. 
  The farm sector is waiting. Farms are neither being bought 
nor sold. The price of an arable hectare has dropped to a third 
of the 60,000 markkas it was a few years back. 
  Farmers are not investing in new equipment or buildings. "We 
farmers have our hackles up. We won't join the EU [European 
Union] under these terms but, luckily for us, we have our own 
advisers who know how we think."

<F P=106> [Article by political editor Pekka Vaisanen: "It Hasn't Been </F>
Cut Off, But It Won't Save Us Either"] 
  [Text] Finland is seeking a 2-billion-markka regional 
subsidy pot in the negotiaitons with the EU [European Union]. 
The subsidy will by no means be like a dinner for Manu [a 
banquet for President Mauno (Manu) Koivisto]: Finland will have 
to contribute more than the same amount out of its own pocket. 
Nor will the money be given as a lump sum, but for carefully 
examined projects. If Finns' own funds and ideas run out, the 
flow of money from Brussels will also come to an end. 
  The EU's latest offer of a new subsidy for sparsely settled 
areas came like a cold shower to the province governors. If the 
EU sticks to its offer, Finland will not get EU supersubsidy 
areas either. 
  Only last November the regional subsidy offer was outlined 
during the negotiations with the EU as a way of making 
reparations for farm sector losses. Finland was promised 
altogether five of the most important EU areas, that is, 
category one areas. In many of the provinces they were already 
jumping for joy. 
  At that time doubters had already raised the question as to 
what the subsidy funds could be used for. The EU grants category 
one aid for the development of infrastructure, that is, the 
construction of roads, communications networks, hospitals, and 
schools, among others. In Finland most of these have already 
been built. 
  Eric Hayes, EU ambassador to Finland, recently also wondered 
at the emphasis placed on category one subsidies with reference 
to Finland's goals. According to him, [these subsidies] are not 
a "gold mine" for a country like Finland, which is already built 
up, especially since this aid also requires investments on one's 
own part. In Hayes' opinion, subsidies for rural areas could be 
more useful for Finland. 
<H5>  Only One Fly in the Ointment </H5>
  What counts chiefly for regional aid per se in Finland are 
subsidies disbursed to businesses, funds granted to the 
provinces, and funds to promote jobs. These funds for regional 
development account for a total of over 3 billion markkas in the 
budget. Calculated in another way, over 20 billion can be found 
in the national budget. The money is in part transferred to the 
provincial governments on the basis of regional policy 
principles as aid for jobs, road-building funds, and 
supplementary aid for agriculture. 
  EU regional policy would to a certain extent limit the 
subsidies Finland disburses to businesses, but it will not put a 
stop to them. Domestic regional policy will be preserved, but it 
will be transformed. Actually, the administration has for years 
now been shaping a system that conforms to the way EU funds are 
distributed. 
  "Regional policy reform has really been effected precisely 
with EU funding in mind. And we are noticeably farther advanced 
in this than Sweden and Norway," regional development adviser 
Risto Tienari of the Interior Ministry boasted. 
  In the national budget there are already in practice 
ready-made regional development subsidies, the national share of 
which required for EU projects can easily be separated from the 
rest. The EU share generally accounts for 50 percent at most. 
The EU grants only a small percentage of this for business 
ventures. 
  Tienari does not believe that Finns will run out of ideas or 
money. He relies on the conviction that there will be enough 
meaningful infrastructure, education, and business projects over 
the next few years. 
<H5>  Pohjois-Savo in the Vanguard </H5>
  There is optimism elsewhere than in the Interior Ministry as 
well. Several provincial associations are already groping for EU 
subsidies and mapping support bases. The Pohjois-Savo 
Association, among others, is in the vanguard of these efforts. 
  Province manager Antti Mykkanen is counting on his 
province's 
getting the Varkaus area included in the aid for industrial 
areas in decline program. The EU would release 9.6 million 
markkas a year for it over a three-year period. The money could 
be used for, among other things, improvement of Varkaus-Joroinen 
Airport, repairing the Number 5 Highway, and investments in 
paper-making machines for the Ahlstrom Company. 
  Mykkanen is also counting on getting 34 million markkas a 
year in rural area subsidies. This aid could be used for a joint 
Stromsdal Company and Koillis-Savo communities cardboard and 
lumber venture and the construction of an Iisalmi bypass road, 
among other things. 
  If Finland gets its version of the new category six aid 
accepted, there would also be aid for the regional communities 
of Koillis-Savo and Yla-Savo, altogether about 70 million 
markkas, Mykkanen estimates. 
  On the west coast the Satakunta Association has been so 
interested in the new subsidies that it has even tested out its 
calculations on the EU Commission. The association expects to 
get the Pori-Rauma area classified as an EU industrial area in 
decline. They could get 180 million markkas from the EU for 
various development projects, but Finland -- businesses, local 
communities, and the national government -- would also have to 
invest 900 million markkas. 
<H5>  Will the State Cut Its Aid for Rural Areas? </H5>
  Mykkanen and his colleagues' enthusiasm over or realism with 
regard to the EU has given rise to terror in the Agricultural 
Producers Association (MTK), among others. There they estimate 
that the subsidies received from the EU would only cover a small 
part of the provinces' potential losses. 
  The MTK's rural area man, Jukka Pekka Kataja, estimates that 
the regional aid provided by the EU would come to about a 
billion while, on the other hand, membership in the EU would 
reduce the state's revenue from taxes on manufactured goods and 
value-added tax by over 15 billion markkas. Kataja estimates 
that, as a result, the state will have to reduce its own 
investments in the regions corresponding to EU aid. 
  "The EU's category one subsidy funds will account for maybe 
one-tenth of what the state itself uses for similar purposes, 
that is, for roads, education, unemployment relief, and 
environmental protection," Kataja compared the two. 
  A report made in Sweden a couple of years ago estimates that 
EU membership will reduce the state's contributions to the 
provinces and that the number of public sector jobs will be 
considerably reduced. Because of the report, opposition to the 
EU increased among the Social Democrats, among others, and in 
the provinces. 
  According to MTK estimates, farm sector gross income would 
drop by at least 500 million markkas in Pojhois-Savo. In that 
organization they believe that the drop in gross income will be 
reflected more extensively in rural sector activities. 
  Province manager Mykkanen estimates that membership in the 
EU 
will cost Pohjois-Savo 400 million markkas. Of this, 300 million 
would be the province's share of Finland's EU membership fee. 
The drop in tax revenue from farmers would deprive the province 
of 100 million. 
<H5>  Problems May Pile Up in Outlying Areas </H5>
  According to Mykkanen, EU membership would cause a "small 
dip" in the 1995-96 regional economy. After that, industry and 
tourism would begin to reduce the deficit. "We'll pull through 
any situation here, that's for sure," Mykkanen said 
optimistically. "But we won't accept the EU's offer regarding 
agriculture and regional policy." 
  The Interior Ministry's Tienari feels that what is important 
in the negotiations with the EU is a solution to the agriculture 
problem that preserves production in at least eastern and 
northern Finland. "It is very important that there be as little 
change as possible in agriculture precisely there since it is in 
those areas that there are now already other major regional 
problems." 
  Tienari noted that in some provinces primary production and 
the public sector provide employment for as much as from 50 to 
60 percent of the work force. "If the number of public and farm 
sector jobs decreases at the same time, these problems may very 
quickly come to a head."

  [Text] Stockholm, March 22 (AFP) -- Conciliation with the 
Serbs in Croatian Krajina and peace in the former Yugoslavia are 
within reach, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic told a press 
conference here Tuesday [22 March]. 
  Granic was in Stockholm for one-day talks with his Swedish 
counterpart, Margaretha af Ugglas. 
  "Right now the United Nations, the European Union, the 
United 
States and Russia are working for peace in the former 
Yugoslavia. Neither the place nor the time are decided upon yet, 
but in two weeks we will know how our negotiations with Serbia 
will begin," Granic said. 
  The situation in Bosnia is improving, the foreign minister 
underlined. 
  Bosnian Moslems and Croats are beginning to overcome their 
differences, and aid convoys are being allowed to pass without 
hindrance, he pointed out. 
  "It is not in our interests for Bosnian Croats to flee to 
Sweden any more. Instead, they ought to stay home. That is the 
opinion of the Croat and Bosnian Croat leaders," Granic said. 
  On Monday, talks between Croatia and the Serb separatists in 
Croatian Krajina began at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. 
  "When it comes to an agreement, Croatia is willing to 
guarantee Serbs that they will be able to run their own schools, 
radio and so on," Granic said.

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION, Dublin] </F>
  [Text] Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds insisted today 
that there was no switch in his government's policy of refusing 
talks with the IRA until it ends its terror campaign. 
  Commenting for the first time on a row over the timetable 
for 
any negotations, generated by a magazine interview with his 
deputy Dick Spring, Mr Reynolds declared: "The position has not 
changed. We want a permanent cessation of violence before the 
IRA or Sinn Fein can start talks as a forerunner to joining 
round-the-table peace negotations." 
  Mr Spring, who is also the republic's foreign minister, 
referred in his weekend interview to the likely response from 
Dublin to a temporary IRA ceasefire. 
  Afterwards, he said such a move could be built upon to 
encourage a permanent end to the violence but his initial 
remarks prompted bitter criticism from Ulster Unionists. 
  In the Dail, the Dublin parliament, today, Mary Harney 
leader 
of the Progressive Democrat opposition party, asked Mr Reynolds 
if he was aware of intelligence reports that IRA recruitment had 
trebled recently. 
  Speaking only hours after his return from official visits to 
the United States and the Bahamas, Mr Reynolds said he knew of 
nothing to indicate that IRA recruitment was rising. 
  Mr Reynolds repeated his view that Gerry Adams, the 
president 
of Sinn Fein, was in favour of peace. "All the evidence and 
information available to me suggests very clearly that Mr Adams 
was preaching peace," he said, referring to Mr Adams' own recent 
visit to New York. 
  But Mr Reynolds also said that the question of Mr Adams 
getting a further U.S. entry visa was a ultimately a decision 
for President Bill Clinton. 
  He said his own trip to the US, for a series of meetings 
about the Downing Street Declaration with Mr Clinton and other 
political leaders, had been "extremely successful."

  [Text] The Tanaiste [deputy prime minister] has said Sinn 
Fein can't be involved in roundtable talks on the future of the 
north until there's a permanent cessation of violence. 
  Speaking in Dublin following talks with the British Foreign 
Secretary Mr. Hurd, Mr. Spring also said there are no 
indications that the IRA is considering a temporary cease-fire. 
Derek Cunningham reports: 
  [Begin Cunningham recording] Mr. Hurd arrived at Iveagh 
House 
in the company of the Tanaiste at around half past tenthis 
morning. The two men spent about an hour together and discussed 
a wide range of topics, including the present state of the peace 
process and the controversy over the enlargement of the European 
Union. 
  After the meeting, Mr. Spring said that--in relation to 
comments attributed to him at the weekend concerning an IRA 
cease-fire--there were no indications that the IRA are 
considering such a move. He said a temporary cease-fire would 
be welcomed by the communities in the north and would be 
encouraged by the government, but Mr. Spring said it was 
difficult to accept peace messages from Sinn Fein by day while 
mortar attacks like those on Heathrow Airport and Crossmaglen 
continued. 
  The British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the Downing 
Street Declaration was not a bargaining ploy but a robust 
statement of principle by the two governments. 
  Mr. Spring will accompany Mr. Hurd on a visit to Newgrange 
later this afternoon. Derek Cunningham RTE news, Iveagh House.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther in </F>
Bonn by Ulrich Wickert in Hamburg on 22 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Wickert] Good evening, Mr. Kanther. 
  [Kanther] Good evening, Mr. Wickert. 
  [Wickert] Mr. Kanther, how was the nationwide action by the 
Kurds possible without the police knowing about it? 
  [Kanther] We will clear up this matter. I believe that the 
violent criminals must be arrested immediately. All possible 
investigations have to be initiated by the police. 
  [Wickert] It would be important to know why that was 
possible. The Kurds started their actions several days ago. The 
police should have known that something might happen. 
  [Kanther] We know that, unfortunately, the Kurdish Workers 
Party [PKK] can rely on good logistic structures -- not only in 
Germany. It is also clear that we will have to increase our 
efforts to obtain relevant information. The ban of the PKK was 
an initial step. However, it is obvious that we must adopt more 
far-reaching measures. 
  [Wickert] Are the current incidents not proof that the ban 
of the PKK was not efficient? 
  [Kanther] No, it is the other way around. The question is: 
Should we have refrained from this step and done nothing? We 
naturally collected information and data, and we found weapons 
but not enough. Thus, we must now adopt tough measures against 
the offenders and use this opportunity to obtain additional 
information on the PKK. The ban must be further implemented, 
and the possibilities provided by the aliens' law -- 
particularly deportation -- must be fully utilized. 
  [Wickert] Do you proceed from the premise that the PKK is 
behind the actions? 
  [Kanther] I am quite certain. 
  [Wickert] Can you prove it? 
  [Kanther] I am certain that there are no other Kurdish 
organizations that would have been in a position to organize 
rallies by hundreds of thousands of people in several large 
German towns last Sunday [20 March]. I am convinced that 
today's actions on the motorways were organized by the same 
group. I will do everything possible to use these data together 
with the interior ministers of the laender to initiate criminal 
proceedings and trials on the basis of the aliens' law. 
  [Wickert] You are offering the laender the help of the 
Federal Border Police. Do you believe the police in the laender 
are not capable of solving the problem? 
  [Kanther] No, not at all. I am convinced that my 
counterparts in the laender -- the interior ministers -- are 
aware of the danger that these actions pose in the criminal 
sense. I am sure they know that these actions may disturb the 
peaceful coexistence between Germans and foreigners -- between 
Germans and Kurds in particular. They will take vigorous action 
to clear up these things. However, if barricades are 
established in many places on motorways and if fires are laid, 
the help of the Federal Border Police might be welcome. This is 
the reason I offered it. 
  [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Kanther. 
  [Kanther] Good bye, Mr. Wickert.

  [Text] Must we once again fear the Russian military? 
  The generals in Moscow have developed a new chemical weapon. 
The project is considered to be a state secret (code: "A 
232"). A scientist who informed the West about it was arrested 
for betraying state secrets. 
  The nerve poison (called "Novikhok") reportedly works even 
faster and more strongly than all chemical combat agents known 
so far. Bonn is alarmed. Dieter Kastrup, state secretary in the 
Foreign Ministry, says: "The Federal Government is worried

believes there is a "very good chance" that the governing 
coalition with the FDP [Free Democratic Party] can be continued 
after the Bundestag elections in October. Kohl also made it 
clear in Bonn today that he expects the Free Democrats to issue 
a coalition pledge in favor of the Union. The FDP has always 
known what is in its own best interests, Kohl said. He is 
confident they will continue to do so. In addition to this, they 
can hardly point out to voters the good work done by the 
coalition and at the same time announce its break-up.

Land consisting of the Social Democratic Party [SPD], Free 
Democratic Party [FDP], and Alliance [the east German Greens] 
has finally collapsed six months before the land elections. 
Following the session of the coalition committee, the 
Brandenburg parliamentary group leaders announced the end of the 
trilateral alliance in Potsdam this evening. It appears that a 
minority government consisting of the SPD and FDP will govern 
the land in the future. The SPD has 35 seats in the 88-member 
Landtag; the FDP has six.

and Liberals have agreed to a two-party coalition following the 
collapse of the trilateral alliance last night. SPD [Social 
Democratic Party] parliamentary group chairman Wolfgang Birthler 
told journalists in Potsdam today that the minority government 
would operate on the basis of the existing cooperation agreement 
reached in November 1990. Only the objective of devoting even 
greater effort toward the creation of jobs would be added to the 
existing coalition paper. 
  The Liberals intend to add further amendments following a 
private meeting this weekend. Both partners stressed their wish 
to continue their "successful policies as before" until the 
regular Landtag elections this autumn. There will be no 
fundamental break with previous government policy, Birthler said.

<F P=106> ["rmc" report: "New Army Inspector Appointed"] </F>
  [Text] Koblenz -- Lieutenant General Hartmut Bagger is the 
new Bundeswehr Army inspector. Yesterday in Koblenz Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) appointed him 
as successor to Lieutenant General Helmut Hansen. At the same 
time, the 3d Corps, which is stationed in Koblenz, was dissolved 
after 37 years of existence and put into service as the new Army 
Operations Command. 
  This restructuring is a "milestone" for the German Army, 
Ruehe said. At the same time, he stressed that the foreign and 
domestic policy challenges for the Bundeswehr have "clearly 
increased." Germany must remain a reliable partner in the 
international community. The main defense forces can be reduced 
in terms of "presence and readiness for action." At the same 
time, crisis reaction forces, which "can be deployed and 
transferred quickly," must be created. Ruehe paid tribute to 
Army Inspector Hansen as a "dedicated advocate of the troop." 
He has "essential credit" for restructuring the Army in unified 
Germany. Hansen will become the new commander in chief of the 
Central Europe NATO forces. 
  With the Army Operations Command the Army for the first time 
has an instrument with which German Army units can be commanded 
at a purely national level in operations abroad. In the future, 
the Army Operations Command, the Army Office, and the Army 
Support Command are subordinate to the Army inspector only as 
the supreme commander for troop service. In contrast, the Army 
Operations Command plans and commands all Army operations. The 
inspector remains responsible for Army planning and remains a 
departmental head in the Defense Ministry. The first practical 
experience was gathered by the staff of Commanding General Klaus 
Reinhardt, who will remain in command as head of the Army 
Operations Command, during the mission in Somalia. 
  The Army Operations Command in Koblenz has the following 
responsibilities: 

  -  Planning and preparation of operations 
under national responsibility. These are Bundeswehr operations 
for crisis prevention and settlement and also operations for 
humanitarian and disaster relief. In most cases, troops of 
other nations will also be involved. 
  -  Establishing readiness for 
action of the necessary contingents; 
  -  Commanding the operations 
of German Army units abroad; 
  -  The preparation and carrying out of 
military exercises and maneuvers at national and international 
level; 
  -  Cooperation with German civilian offices for the 
"territorial organization" of national defense.

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "After Bad Kleinen: BKA Chief Looks </F>
Forward"] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- The Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations (BKA), which was subjected to harsh public 
criticism after the antiterrorism operation in Bad Kleinen, 
finally wants to get out of the negative headlines. The year 
1994 must become "a year of consolidation" for the Wiesbaden 
police authority, BKA President Hans-Ludwig Zachert said in an 
interview with DIE WELT, formulating the strategic targets for 
the next few months. "The view is directed forward." 
  Zachert is firmly convinced that the planned new 
organization 
of the BKA's command structure, including the trimming of the 
department echelons, will have a positive effect. On the basis 
of this restructuring, the president is to get three main 
departmental heads as a leading team at his side. The current 
12 departments are being reduced to nine so that one main 
departmental head always heads three sections. 
  In this connection, the BKA chief categorically rejects the 
impression that these organizational changes are effectively 
aimed at "depriving" the president "of power." Such claims in 
public are completely unfounded. After talks with FRG Interior 
Minister Manfred Kanther it is clear: "The BKA president 
retains his full power of direction. The ultimate 
responsibility rests exclusively with him. And anyone who has 
this responsibility also has the final say; this was also 
stressed by Minister Kanther in this way." 
  According to Zachert, the BKA's internal consolidation phase 
must be supplemented by having the federal authorities "move 
closer toward each other." This is particularly necessary 
regarding the Federal Intelligence Office. Here there will have 
to be far more intensive forms of cooperation on a new legal 
basis, in particular in the fields of combating drug trafficking 
and international terrorism. 
  As a "very personal concern" Zachert cited the further 
expansion of the "traditionally good relationship" with the 
chief federal prosecutor. The first contacts with the new chief 
federal prosecutor, Kay Nehm, in Karlsruhe were "extremely 
positive." Zachert and Nehm have known each other for years. 
  In Zachert's view, the necessary consolidation in the BKA 
also includes efforts in investigations against left-wing 
terrorism that "are not just intensified when there have been 
attacks." Much rather, it is necessary to act anticyclically, 
showing intensified vigilance in particular when there have not 
been any attacks for a long time. 
  Furthermore, Zachert thinks it is a "signal" that the 
Antiterrorism Department, which has so far been located in 
Wiesbaden, will be transferred to the state protection authority 
in Meckenheim. The BKA chief hopes that this will lead to an 
increase in the efficiency of work and a more flexible use of 
personnel. In the parent office in Wiesbaden the free 
capacities will be used for intensifying the fight against 
organized crime, the highest-ranking German policeman announced. 
  Zachert said that it is "deplorable" for the intended 
consolidation period of his authority that the new BKA law can 
obviously not be passed by the end of this legislative period. 
Therefore, new regulations concerning preliminary 
investigations, the protection of witnesses, and the 
internationally organized fight against terrorism unfortunately 
cannot yet develop the hoped-for "positive feedback effects on 
the new organization."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Trust Agency President Birgit </F>
Breuel by Nikolaus Blome in Berlin; date not given: "`We Cost 
Less Than the Coal'"] 
  [Text] In 1998 -- almost -- everything will be over: All 
enterprises privatized, all contracts controlled, all assets 
refunded to the communities and private persons. So the curtain 
at the end of this year will not be the final curtain on the 
Trust Agency stage. The reason for it was outlined by Trust 
Agency President Birgit Breuel during a visit to the offices of 
DIE WELT: "We were dipped into West German bureaucracy" -- with 
all its regulations, guidelines, and laws that became bloated 
over 40 years. 
  The commercialization of the property in real estate and 
land 
will even reach into the next millennium, a total of 200,000 
claims for restitution have been filed. Mrs. Breuel's blood 
pressure is going up whenever there is an argument about the 
future number of personnel in the successor organizations: 
"Those who want fewer people have to say which tasks they want 
to put off or which tasks they do not want to fulfill at all." 
People in Bonn should hear that. After all, in Bonn, various 
expert opinions from the Federal Audit Court and from Kienbaum 
enterprise consultants have been circulated, providing arguments 
for a radical reduction of the Trust Agency staff. And the 
responsible Bundestag committee has decided that "in all 
appropriate cases" work will be awarded as federal orders to 
private companies -- without separate Trust Agency successor 
corporations. "In principle, I like the idea very much," Breuel 
said. However, this would leave questions of liability unclear, 
and in the case of putting off investment promises, equal 
treatment would become impossible if there are various private 
controllers of a contract, Breuel said and added: "Why send our 
east German experts home to provide work for west German 
consultants?" 
  Still, looking back leaves the president satisfied. Although 
the Agency will leave a mountain of debts of almost 275 billion 
German marks [DM], "this is less than a single industry, west 
German coal, has cost the taxpayer." She said she was also 
proud of the approximately 2,600 companies that went to their 
own -- in most cases east German -- management. Apart from 
that, "individual mistakes" have been made, but, all in all, 
eastern Germany has embarked on the direct path to become a 
"highly modern industrial center, albeit with problems on the 
labor market." Indeed; although job and investment promises are 
widely met, and although, according to Breuel, only 77 of the 
13,500 privatized companies have gone bankrupt, three out four 
jobs in the industry have disappeared since 1989. 
  Hardly anything remains of research, which used to be part 
of 
the old combines, because research was the first thing that 
Trust Agency enterprises began to cut. "That is not our fault," 
Breuel said categorically. However, at the same time, she 
admits that, at the beginning the Trust Agency was the only 
powerful authority in eastern Germany -- even though it was not 
one that should or wanted to make politics. And it certainly 
did not want to indulge in structural policy, which did not fit 
into the Berlin Agency's desired "entrepreneurial behavior." 
  When, one after the other, the new laender gradually began 
to 
try to fill this vacuum, cooperation was very good. Breuel: 
"The land governments have gone very far." With similar 
respect she looks at the work forces and work councillors in the 
enterprises that had to undergo these radical changes. "After 
all, everything, really everything has changed for these people." 
  It is thus, all the more astonishing that protests like 
those 
in the Bischofferode potassium mine, did not happen earlier and 
more often. "I never went there because it would have led to an 
explosion," the president said. Yet, it was in Bischofferode 
where, for the first time, "politics" intervened massively and 
made the potassium miners false hopes. "The Gysis of this 
world" were seeking and managed to find new fields for their 
activities in Bischofferode.

<F P=106> [Report by Kurt Kieselbach: "One Million for Retraining"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn/Schwerin -- The Federal Employment Office (BA) 
in 1994 spared 1.3 million people in the new laender 
unemployment by providing them with financial means. This was 
stated yesterday by FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem in 
Schwerin. For this purpose, 35.6 billion German marks [DM] have 
been allocated to the eastern laender. A total of DM54 billion, 
42 percent, of DM107.2 billion from the BA budget are used for 
"active labor market policy" in the country. 
  "The core of the BA's active labor market policy is the 
promotion of vocational qualification," said BA President 
Bernhard Jagoda, who, together with Bluem, honored the 100,000th 
retrained construction worker with a certificate in the training 
center of the construction industry in the capital of 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. More than 1 million people in 
eastern Germany have participated in advanced training since 
German unification. Vocational advanced training and retraining 
is subsidized with DM15 billion in Germany, DM7.7 billion of 
that in the east. 
  The construction industry is considered to be the driving 
force of the economy in the new laender. Thus, from mid-1992 to 
mid-1993, the number of people employed rose by 11 percent to 
700,000. 
  At first, the billions poured into advanced training and 
retraining also attracted dubious figures. Bluem: "Especially 
in the new laender, black sheep had established themselves among 
the institutions providing training in order to earn a lot of 
money quickly." Together with the Nuremberg BA, this 
development was counted with determination by sending groups of 
inspectors on site. The latest inspection did not result in any 
complaints. Bluem assumes that up to 600,000 places in 
necessary advanced training measures can be financed in 1994. 
  Advanced traning for master craftsmen or engineers are no 
longer subsidized in line with the Labor Promotion Law. 
However, those affected can participate in a new loan program, 
which is an instrument to bolster any adverse effects.

<F P=106> ["bid"-attributed report: "Necker Suggests Cooperation on </F>
Foreign Markets"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 21 Mar -- The German economy must, at any 
rate, be represented on the dynamic growth markets of Asia, 
Latin America, and East Europe. This appeal was made by Tyll 
Necker, the president of the Federal Association of German 
Industry [BDI], at a congress of his organization in Bonn on the 
issue of "Germany's Role in the World." 
  Positive developments have already taken place in some 
spheres, Necker said, referring to the Federal Government's Asia 
concept. Even now, Germany is the most important trading partner 
for many Asian countries, but the results are lagging behind 
expectations. German exports and the technology transfer to this 
part of the world only account for 10 percent of German foreign 
trade. German investment in the Asian-Pacific region amounts to 
3-4 percent of total foreign investments. 
  It is important not only to increase exports to promising 
regions but to be present on location and to invest, Necker 
emphasized. One has to think of new forms of cooperation with 
local companies. "Package solutions that not only supply plants 
but also run them, thus earning funding and payment, are 
necessary," he said. 
  The BDI president sharply criticized the trend toward new 
protectionism in connection with environmental and social 
standards. This is not the right instrument to secure 
international environmental standards or standards for 
employees. Lower wage costs are often the only competitive 
advantage developing countries have. Necker demanded that they 
should not be stripped of this advantage. 
  At the Congress, Saarland Minister President Oskar 
Lafontaine, of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], 
warned against hasty European monetary union. As a result of 
economic developments, the Maastricht timetable cannot be kept. 
Lafontaine said that "any automatism would be fatal." He 
called for better coordination between national banks in the 
European Union [EU]. National strategies are anachronistic. 
The deputy SPD chairman came out in favor of a joint European 
approach to solving problems such as unemployment. Lafontaine 
emphasized that common European foreign and security policy must 
start from cooperation between Bonn/Berlin and Paris. 
  Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group, called 
for a collective approach to solve international security 
policy. Maintaining the ability to be a good member in the 
alliance and a good partner is of top priority, but greater 
emphasis must also go to elements of development and 
environmental policy. NATO and the European Union must be 
further consolidated. Within the framework of growing 
international responsibility, Germany must participate in the 
military protection of stability with equal rights and duties, 
Schaeuble demanded. Peace and security cannot be had for free.

<F P=106> [Interview with FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt by </F>
Dirk Hoeren; place and date not given: "I Stand Like a Rock"] 
  [Excerpt] [Hoeren] Mr. Minister, we already have 4 
million unemployed -- are things still going to get worse? 
  [Rexrodt] As a result of the companies' efforts to trim 
production processes and of the slimming down of the economy, 
even more jobs may be abolished. That is why it is so important 
to break up the structures of the labor market: more 
flexibility, more part-time work. 
  In 1995 at the latest, we will lastingly undercut the 
4-million mark in unemployment. 
  [Hoeren] Where are the new jobs supposed to come from? 
  [Rexrodt] The greatest reserves exist in the service sector. 
If we give services to people a higher social standing again, 
there will be a labor boom in this field. 
  [Hoeren] The Bonn government has repeatedly cut back social 
benefits. When will it finally be the turn of the big ones? 
  [Rexrodt] We are working on a complete restructuring of the 
current system of subsidies: In the future, subsidies are to be 
generally granted only for a specific period. I am thinking of 
a period of five years. 
  In addition, the state subsidies are to be reduced in 
certain 
steps within this period. 
  We must also come to a regulation that state subsidies must 
be repaid on principle as soon as the company's economic 
situation has improved again. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["hg." report: "Room for Money Market Interest Rates"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt -- The fact that the Central Bank Council 
did not make a decision on the key rates on 17 March does not 
mean that nothing is going to happen, because "the money market 
interest rate need not continue to be unchanged," Bundesbank 
President Dr. Hans Tietmeyer said at a reception of the Federal 
Association of German Banks in Bonn on the occasion of the 
replacement of Federal Association President Dr. Eberhard 
Martini by Dr. Karl-Heinz Wessel. In this way, Tietmeyer alluded 
to the Bundesbank's opportunities within the framework of its 
open-market policy. 
  "We have been using all our room for maneuver on stability 
policies and we will continue to do so," the Bundesbank 
president said. However, the Bundesbank also must not fail to 
see the risks that still threaten stability. In this respect, 
the Association for the Protection of Savers is right with its 
statement that the war against inflationary forces has not yet 
been won. However, progress has been made on the road to 
greater stability. February inflation is still clearly above 3 
percent, but without the gasoline-tax increase there would 
already be a 2 before the decimal point, Tietmeyer said. 
However, a considerable part of this improvement is due to 
lower import prices and thus not earned in Germany. 
  The Bundesbank president also assessed the latest collective 
agreements as a positive signal for future monetary stability. 
After some wrong tracks in the past, the parties to collective 
agreements have now turned into the road of reason, he said. 
However, the Bundesbank is concerned about the strong expansion 
of the money supply. The M3 value, which increased by more than 
20 percent in January, is the value for one month calculated on 
a yearly basis, and it is distorted by special factors. 
However, the liquidation effect resulting from the new tax 
regulation may not disappear in the short term, all the more so 
since the latest wait-and-see attitude on the capital markets 
has not yet been overcome. The money supply continues to be an 
important indicator for the bank, he said. 
  However, the money supply is a yearly and not a monthly 
target, Tietmeyer stressed. Moreover, it is only an 
intermediate target on the road to the actual objective of price 
stability. At any rate, the latest development on the 
international capital markets has little to do with the 
development of the money supply in Germany and even less with 
the Bundesbank's policy. This is shown not least by 
developments on the foreign exchange market. 
  Referring to the criticism of the trend of earnings of 
German 
banks, Tietmeyer said that it is precisely in periods of 
economic weakness that well-founded and highly profitable banks 
are important for the economy as a whole. They are a 
stabilizing factor in an altogether difficult and insecure 
environment. However, the Bundesbank president also added: "Of 
course, this does not mean that the ability to pass on relief 
from the Bundesbank is already being fully utilized by all 
banks." 
  In the efforts to improve the efficiency of Germany as a 
financial location, the introduced reorganization and reduction 
of minimum reserves by the Bundesbank fits the new scene very 
well. "However, the reduction of minimum reserves is not the 
first step toward their abolition," the Bundesbank president 
stressed. The Bundesbank thinks that the instrument of minimum 
reserves continues to be indispensable, and it will advocate 
that minimum reserves will also become one of the monetary 
policy instruments of the future European Central Bank. 
  In his speech, FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel made it 
clear 
that the FRG Government wants to continue to support the 
development of Germany as a financial location. However, when 
Waigel said that the tax on interest income is the best 
decision, he met with a clear response in the hall. Waigel 
countered by saying that the tax on interest income was 
developed with the participation of a representative of the 
association and he told the bankers present: "I will gladly pass 
on your annoyance to Karlsruhe, but you cannot vent it on the 
finance minister here in Bonn."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gerald Braunberger: "The Money Supply Put to </F>
the Test"] 
  [Text] Hardly anything occupies financial markets as much 
as the monetary policy of the large central banks. Today, 
specialists in large and small commercial banks and securities 
dealers are busy monitoring it. Whoever assesses well the 
monetary strategies and measures can make much money for his 
firm. For in the international trade with foreign currencies, 
shares, bonds, and precious metals, prices usually react 
strongly to changes in monetary and currency policy. 
  For some weeks now, individual large central banks have been 
a cause of worry for traders and analysts. While in February it 
was the U.S. Federal Reserve ("Fed") which upset market 
participants with its albeit slight, yet unexpected, raise in 
short-term interest rates, these days the German Bundesbank is 
the center of attention. Since publication of a 20.6 percent 
growth rate of the money supply for January--evidently distorted 
by some special influences--banks and stock exchanges are 
questioning whether the money supply figures are still a valid 
indicator for the future attitude of the Bundesbank. And not a 
few contemporaries are advising the Bundesbank to act as other 
central banks, such as the Fed, are doing and to finally give up 
the attempt to regulate the money supply. 
  From the viewpoint of a trader or capital investor acting in 
the short term, this conclusion is not illogical. Market 
participants, who on occasion do transactions in a matter of 
seconds, want reliable information whose significance does not 
depend on subsequent long explanations in the media. A trader is 
hardly served by the statement that the money supply figures at 
the beginning of the year are basically less important than 
those at year's end, but that nonethless one must not neglect 
the figures at the beginning of the year. He wants to know 
unequivocally: Is this figure correct and important? 
  But the approach to a money supply policy is not of a 
short-term, but rather of a long-term nature. The doctrine of 
money supply policy, the so-called monetarism, is based on two 
tenets: There is a long-term, parallel connection between the 
money supply of an economy and the inflation rate. This is 
largely undisputed and proven by a great number of examples. 
That it is usual for prices to rise if the bank note press had 
previously rotated too fast, is also not particularly surprising. 
  The practical difficulty for a central bank is to define 
precisely what is to be included in the money supply in view of 
the speed with which ever new products are being created in the 
financial markets. In Germany, in addition to cash, are included 
sight deposits, time deposits with a life up to four years, and 
savings deposits with three-months' withdrawal notices 
maintained in domestic banks and savings banks by private 
households and enterprises. This demarcation has proven itself 
all in all. But in other countries, such as the United States, 
this has not functioned nearly as well. The second basic tenet 
of the monetarists, according to which a central bank can 
reliably control the money supply, is therefore very 
controversial. Many monetarists have evidently underestimated 
the complexity of modern financial markets. 
  Nevertheless, a farewell to monetarism would be premature 
for 
two reasons. Namely, the most important reasons for the 
sometimes strong short-term fluctuations in the German money 
supply can be found in a misguided policy by the governments. 
This thesis is permissible: With more appropriate actions by 
governments, money supply statistics would send less confusing 
signals. The crises of the European Monetary System have 
sometimes inflated the German money supply. But the currency 
crises occurred only because the governments of the EU members 
previously had not been in a position to make the adjustments of 
the exchange rates which, from an economic aspect, had long been 
overdue. 
  A sad chapter, not only for monetary policy, is the tax 
chaos 
following an interest discount. Among other reasons, the money 
supply grew so strongly in December 1993 and January 1994 
because irritated investors, primarily for tax reasons, sold 
shares in investment funds and stashed them--probably only 
temporarily--as bank deposits. Furthermore, the government's tax 
policy promoted increased use of cash--actually an anachronism. 
And lastly, a change in the rules of the already totally 
overdrawn subsidy of the housing market set off a rush on 
building loans, which further inflated the money supply. 
  A further strength of the monetarist money supply policy 
consists in tying the central bank to a long-term policy 
orientation. Economists have shown in a great number of works 
that a long-term orientation of monetary policy can produce 
better results than measures motivated by the short term. And 
lastly, one must also ask the critics of a money supply policy 
what then should take its place. 
  Now and then, it is being proposed that the Bundesbank 
manipulate the interest structure, i.e., the ratio of short-term 
and long-term interest rates. True, this idea has theoretical 
merits. But in practice, the recently observed fluctuations of 
long-term interest rates, effected by enormous capital 
movements, make such an idea appear not very practicable. And it 
is also not possible to return to a global currency system with 
the U.S. dollar as the key currency, in which the other central 
banks are only concerned with keeping the dollar exchange rate 
stable. 
  The money supply policy is a concept with strengths and 
weaknesses. It may be quite possible that, due to changes in the 
financial markets, it will suffer further damage in Germany 
also. For the time being, however, there is no alternative to 
it. It is uncertain whether one will ever be found. For, as 
economist Juerg Niehans once wrote, money supply policy after 
all is not a science, but an art.

<F P=106> [Commentary by former SPD Labor Minister Herbert Ehrenberg: </F>
"Doubt About the Course of the Bundesbank; The German Economy 
Now Needs a Sharp Interest Rate Cut"] 
  [Text] The west German economy lurches along; a review of 
preliminary data shows an even worse underlying situation. The 
gross domestic product shrank in the fourth quarter of 1993, by 
0.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, and by 0.9 percent 
compared to the previous year; equipment investments dropped by 
2 percent; construction investments by 1.5 percent in real 
terms. The number of unemployed also continued to grow in 
February. With the exception of 1993, during the past ten years 
the February figures of the labor market were always more 
favorable than those in January. 
  In its monthly report of February 1994, the Bundesbank 
states 
that the "west German economy" continues to move "in a trough;" 
according to this analysis, "the trends of weakness are now 
concentrated in private consumption and investment activity." 
  Despite this depressing analysis, the Bundesbank leadership 
seems to have no doubt whatsoever about its own policy. As late 
as last week, Vice President Gaddum saw no cause for changes in 
the course of monetary policy, and Bundesbank President 
Tietmeyer warned against "employment-motivated currency 
manipulations," at the same time rejecting all accusations that 
the Bundesbank is coresponsible for the crisis in the industrial 
base and underemployment. 
  But confrontations of the Bundesbank policy with overall 
economic data and comparisons with monetary policy in the United 
States raise many doubts about the course of the Bundesbank. 
Although the real gross domestic product in the third quarter of 
1991 shrank by 0.5 percent compared to the previous quarter and 
equipment investments dropped by 2 percent, the Bundesbank in 
August 1991 raised the discount rate from 6.5 to 7.5 percent. In 
July 1992 (after an intermediate step), the discount rate 
reached 8.75 percent, the highest ever in the Federal Republic. 
Yet the gross domestic product and equipment investments in real 
terms had been declining since the summer of 1991 from quarter 
to quarter, with the exception of the first quarter of 1992. 
However, only in March 1993 was the discount rate (after two 
ministeps) lowered by half a point below the peak level of 8 
percent--despite the continuing steep decline of the economy: 
After a real decline of equipment investments by 3.5 percent in 
the third quarter of 1992, the minus rate in the two following 
quarters amounted to 5 and 5.5 percent, respectively. 
  The Bundesbank reports time and again praise the "continuity 
of monetary policy." But it is highly questionable whether 
applause is deserved by a continuity which, parallel to the 
steep decline in growth, reached today's discount rate of 5.25 
percent with nine "ministeps" over 15 months. Even after these 
many miniscule operations, the discount rate is still above the 
level of the summer of 1989--and at that time, the national 
product grew by 4 percent in real terms. A six-point decline in 
the growth rate clamors for a sharp lowering of interest rates. 
  In the Bundesbank's monetary policy argumentation, economic 
growth and employment are ignored, the direction is set by the 
(self-imposed) money supply goal, the exchange rate development 
and the price level. 
  In the latter, the differences are only slight: The 
cost-of-living price index rose in 1989 by 2.8 percent, and in 
January 1994 by 3.5 percent. The Bundesbank itself lists the 
rate of price increases at 2.5 percent, excluding tax increases 
whose effects cannot be influenced by monetary policy. 
  Despite all fluctuations in economic development and their 
various causes, Bundesbank policy since the mid-1970's is 
primarily guided by its own money supply goals although, since 
the glamor of monetarism is fading, the suitability of the money 
supply as a monetary action indicator is more and more put into 
question. Sensibly enough, there have been no wrong reactions to 
the recent, extremely steep increase in the money supply; the 
Bundesbank itself has cited a number of "special factors" as 
explanation. 
<H5>  Questionable Exchange Rate Orientation </H5>
  Perhaps the (quickly passing) shock on the financial 
markets, 
after the announcement of the most recent money supply figures, 
will finally lead to making this tool more relative in the 
public eye. At the bottom of less than 80 percent capacity 
utilization rate and a labor force reservoir of four to six 
million, an expanded money supply cannot cause serious 
disturbances. Any higher demand can easily be satisfied by the 
existing underused production potential. 
  Economically even more questionable is the Bundesbank's 
exchange rate orientation. Germany's high interest rate policy 
in the summer of 1992 was the strongest cause of the EMS 
[European Monetary System] currency turbulences, and German 
exports were additionally affected by the subsequent revaluation 
of the German mark [DM] amidst weak world market demand. 
Although the Bundesbank reassuringly points to the corrections 
made in the meantime, behind the average of these changes is 
still concealed an almost 10-percent revaluation of the German 
mark vis-a-vis EC currencies. The devaluations vis-a-vis the 
U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen cannot compensate for that. 
  In economic terms, nothing speaks in favor of keeping the DM 
exchange rate high in the European Union [EU] currency area. Due 
to the 10-percent revaluation, the export industry suffered a 
cost burden equivalent to a 10-percent wage increase. A sharp 
lowering of standard interest rates would facilitate investment 
financing, relieve exports and decrease the money supply, since 
short-term investments would no longer be so attractive. 
  The FRG should learn from the U.S. example: In the United 
States in 1992 and 1993, real growth rates of 2.6 and 3.0 
percent were achieved with a discount rate of 3 percent, with 
price increases of 3 percent each year. And after the last 
discount hike (noted with great attention here), the U.S. 
discount rate is still two full percentage points below that of 
Germany. There are many good growth and stability reasons for 
the Bundesbank to steer towards this level as rapidly as 
possible.

<F P=106> [Frank Wehner report: "Bill Pretends To Be Kennedy"] </F>
  [Text] On Friday [18 March] the world did not yet suspect 
that Kim bombs and Dong missiles [as published] might bless it 
soon with another war. However, it is now discussed in the 
White House how North Korea can be forced to its knees. The 
reasonable decision to cancel the Team Spirit maneuver will 
probably be rescinded and Patriot missiles are to be sent on a 
journey. 
  In former times, Kennedy had the Cuban crisis and Bush had 
Kuwait. Clinton sticks to the K's [German spelling of Cuba is 
with a K], while, of course, issues other than only Korea are 
also at stake. 
  The trip by the U.S. secretary of state to East Asia was not 
precisely a success. Exactly for that reason, it cannot hurt to 
demonstrate to this region, above all to Beijing, that 
Washington can show its teeth. This crisis is also good for 
domestic use: The gossip about Clinton's Whitewater affair is 
far too lustful. It is high time that topics of conversation 
are imported. 
  At present, the favorite opponent in the Middle East is of 
little use. First of all, it has to be forgotten that for 
almost one month Washington prevented the Security Council from 
commenting on the Hebron massacre. In the Balkans, ownerless 
planes that can be destroyed cannot be found every day. In 
Central America the United States is cutting such a figure with 
its policy toward Haiti that it is better for everyone not to 
look there. 
  Thus, what remains? Old Kim with his bomb, which perhaps 
does not exist at all. A rigid regime, which has been driven to 
the wall, is boasting as if it were a superpower, precisely at 
the right time, so that Clinton can save the world -- in a way 
that will only result in an escalation of everything if prudence 
does not soon prevail. 
  Well, Clinton pretends to be Kennedy. It is true that now 
the opponent is many numbers smaller, but it is Bill who is 
acting. And if a fire breaks out, he will be big enough.

<F P=106> [Udo Bergdoll editorial: "Dialogue With the Russian Bear"] </F>
  [Text] Meetings between Helmut Kohl and Boris Yeltsin and 
telephone conversations between Klaus Kinkel and Andrey Kozyrev 
have become a matter of routine for the chancellor and the 
foreign minister. Both consider it necessary to have the 
closest possible contact with their Russian counterparts. Bonn 
does not expect a smooth development concerning the major power 
in the East which is split socially and destroyed economically, 
but which wants to become a superpower again. Thus, Bonn does 
not want to miss any opportunity to exert influence as long as 
possible. For this reason, the foreign minister is again 
visiting his Russian counterpart in Moscow -- to accelerate the 
lengthy talks on the return of cultural goods, for example, but, 
above all, to continue the dialogue on security in Europe. 
  Two tendencies are beginning to emerge -- a reassuring and 
an 
alarming one. On the one hand, it seems possible to transform 
relations between Germany and Russia into normal bilateral 
relations. On the other, however, Russian and Western interests 
seem to diverge. According to U.S. ideas, Russia should be a 
partner, but it might also develop into an unpredictable 
competitor. In fact, Kozyrev is considered a Western-oriented 
man. Yet if one analyzes his statements about Moscow's role in 
Europe and the world, they reveal a new imperialist claim. 
Thus, Bonn also wavers between hope and fear when the few 
reformers that Yeltsin still has spell out what they understand 
by "strategic partnership" (Kozyrev) with the United States and 
collective security in Europe. It is now the task of German 
foreign policy to avoid setting the wrong course. 
  The close personal contact with the rulers in Moscow is 
advisable for Bonn because the diplomatic development between 
the two capitals is not free of friction. The Russian 
ambassador to Bonn, Vladislav Terekhov, was Soviet ambassador 
before the fall of the Wall. At the beginning of the coup 
against Gorbachev, he came to the Chancellor's Office to 
announce the names of the new partners in the Kremlin. He must 
know a great deal to survive for such a long time in his 
position in Bonn, members of the diplomatic corps have pointed 
out. Recently, Terekhov has again been behaving in a way that 
made Bonn officials believe that they have missed another coup. 
The following may serve as an example: Those who doubt that 
the Baltic republics belong to Russia are told by the Russian 
ambassador that this region has been part of Russia for 250 
years and that it is nobody's business when the troops withdraw. 
The smooth withdrawal of the Russian soldiers from Berlin and 
East Germany is an absolutely positive result of the new 
relationship between Bonn and Moscow. Chancellor Kohl ensures 
that the withdrawal of the Red Army, which advanced as far as 
Central Europe under Stalin, is taking place without any 
humiliation. One can only hope that justice will also be done 
to the Western Allies who were the protectors and not the 
occupiers of Berlin. Attentiveness vis-a-vis the East requires 
an explanation to the West if it is not to be misunderstood. 
  For Germany, Russia is a major power that must be integrated 
in a new system of European security and whose isolation should 
be prevented. Bonn also shows understanding that such a big 
country does not want to be treated in the same way as smaller 
states from its former sphere of influence. However, Russia's 
ideas about the future balance, which seem harmless at first 
sight, conceal Moscow's hegemonial claims. The Russians want 
NATO to be subordinated to the seemingly dead CSCE. The Western 
alliance could then ensure order in its sphere of influence, and 
Russia could do the same in the CIS states. In fact, the West 
also believes that Russian soldiers should end the bloodshed in 
the Caucasus. Yet NATO does not want to give them a permanent 
mandate or a blank check. Russian troops should only be allowed 
to refer to the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris upon 
the wish of all parties to the conflict. The West believes that 
everything else would be assistance in reawakening the former 
Soviet Union. However, there is no longer any place for "vital 
spheres of interest" in Europe, as claimed by Moscow, after the 
fundamental changes that have taken place. Thus, the 
"Partnership for Peace" must not be the final response to the 
desires of the reform states in Central and East Europe for 
security under NATO cover. 
  Moscow has intensively looked to Bonn for some time because 
only Germany has provided substantive financial aid so far. At 
the moment, the Russians are focusing on the United States. 
They can only be confirmed as a world power by the United 
States. After all, their determined attitude vis-a-vis Bosnia 
and the fear of being humiliated by NATO and the United States 
led to the cease-fire of Sarajevo without air strikes. For 
Bonn, Moscow is a Janus-faced partner. Should it look to the 
future? Or should it look back in anger? It is going in both 
directions at the same time.

<F P=106> [Report signed "S.H.": "Mitterrand: Social Warning"] </F>
  [Text] Francois Mitterrand yesterday rejected any solution 
to unemployment in the industrialized countries which would 
involve "a reduction in wages or a questioning of social 
protection." The head of state, who was speaking at UNESCO 
Headquarters at the opening of the Interparliamentary Union 
[IPU] conference, which will be chaired by National Assembly 
Speaker Philippe Seguin throughout this week, mentioned the 
recent G-7 meeting on employment: "I and others in France have 
worked very hard to ensure that the big countries deal with the 
actual problems of their fellow citizens. That has been made 
possible because a few big countries are no longer advocating 
wage cuts or questioning social protection as a remedy for 
unemployment, although many countries still are tempted to do 
so." 
<H5>  Preventing Conflicts </H5>
  Stressing the need to create "good, real jobs," Francois 
Mitterrand said that although, "strong growth remains vital," it 
is also necessary "to exploit new ways of creating jobs through 
the development of research, technology, education, training 
throughout life, and a new organization of work. There will 
only be lasting progress when social clauses are included in 
international agreements," the president of the Republic 
concluded. The head of state also defended the cause of the 
United Nations, which he thinks is the "perfect framework" for 
preventing conflicts. "This organization is irreplaceable for 
consolidating peace," he said. 
  Philippe Seguin, for his part, argued in favor of 
parliaments, which "have emerged as the main protagonists of 
modernity since the 18th century (...). According to the 
National Assembly speaker, far from demonstrating that national 
parliaments are outdated, the new big world issues -- 
environmental protection, development aid, the organization of 
exchanges of products and capital, the fight against criminal 
networks -- emphasize the need for their determined involvement 
in international affairs." He added that "democracy cannot be 
decreed or improvised; it is the fruit of a patient 
apprenticeship to which we must contribute." This remark is in 
line with the concerns of the Interparliamentary Union which 
intends to draw up in Paris this week, for the first time, a 
"resolution" concerning the conduct of free and democratic 
elections in the world. 
  Senate Speaker Rene Monory said, along the same lines, that 
"parliaments have an important role to play in international 
relations," adding that "no culture, no civilization can escape 
the citizens' legitimate demand to participate in the major 
political decisions through elections by universal suffrage and 
institutions which respect human rights."

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Jean-Louis Dutaret, president of </F>
Sofirad, by Anne Brucy and Roland Mihail; from the "Radio-Com" 
program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Brucy] Sunday [20 March] will be World 
Francophone Day. Today we have the opportunity to assess 
France's external audiovisual action and the activities of 
Sofirad [Broadcasting Holding Company] with its new president 
Jean-Louis Dutaret, who was appointed in January. The issue of 
France's foreign audiovisual policy is a complicated one even if 
it is not a new one for you, since you were an international 
lawyer before becoming adviser to Communications Minister Alain 
Carignon. Sofirad is a holding company managing the 
government's shares in some 20 companies, among them radio and 
television stations. To name a few, for instance: Canal France 
International [CFI], a program data bank broadcast throughout 
the world by satellite; TV-5 Europe, a French-language 
television channel; Canal Horizons, a network of pay TV 
channels; Afrique No. 1; Radio Monte Carlo Middle East; and 
Radio Monte Carlo for radios [as heard]. [passage omitted] 
  We will now turn our attention toward external audiovisual 
policy. As we said earlier, you are managing the state's 
interests in several television channels, and you are talking of 
CFI as the spearhead. Will the strengthening of CFI run against 
the interests of others such as the French-language channel TV-5? 
  [Dutaret] I can only express my personal feeling. I am not 
here to represent the government. 
  [Brucy] However, you are representing Sofirad. You are the 
president of Sofirad. 
  [Dutaret] Sofirad is an extraordinary tool not known to the 
public. Thanks to Sofirad there is worldwide coverage -- I will 
answer your question concerning CFI very soon -- I would like to 
recall that 33 million people throughout the world listen to 
three Sofirad radio stations, 33 million -- as against 11 
million for RFI [Radio France International]. I will not 
compare costs since I do not want to be nasty. However, it must 
be said, we hear a great deal about RFI and we never hear 
anything about Sofirad, with 33 million listeners. Thanks to 
Sofirad France is behind the BBC and the Voice of America and 
ahead of the Voice of Germany [as heard]. This must be said. 
CFI is a great tool enabling all African national television 
channels to exist. If CFI did not offer programs -- I say offer 
-- to most African television channels and to many other 
television channels, these countries would not have television 
channels worthy of the name, and if there are television 
channels worthy of the name it is thanks to French products 
which are distributed by CFI. TV-5 too... 
  [Brucy, interrupting] It is very similar. 
  [Dutaret] Not at all. TV-5 is a French-language channel with 
60 percent French programs, but with Canadian, Belgian, and 
Swiss programs too. It is a genuine French-language channel. I 
believe France must have what is called in our jargon sovereign 
action. It is normal for France to broadcast the image of 
France. This image of France is best broadcast through CFI. 
  [Mihail] The image or the voice of France? Or, even 
possibly, the voice of the French Government? 
  [Dutaret] No, but why not the voice of France? We are the 
only ones to be ashamed of that. There is the Voice of America, 
the Voice of Germany [as heard]. Why can't we speak of the 
Voice of France? We are neither living in a Cold War situation 
nor in a colonial situation. There is no shame in wanting to 
broadcast the voice and the image of France. 
  [Brucy] Speaking of voice, you mentioned RFI earlier. It 
must be said that this station does not belong to the Sofirad 
network. Do you believe that there is a situation of wasteful 
competition and that RFI and the radio activities of Sofirad 
should be better coordinated? 
  [Dutaret] Yes, yes. The mission of Sofirad is not to 
broadcast worldwide. It mainly broadcasts to Maghreb countries, 
to West Africa, and to the Middle East in local languages. 
  [Mihail] Precisely, what is the best choice? To target the 
whole world to reach, for instance, farmers in Malaysia or 
shepherds in Afghanistan who might not even possess a radio set, 
or to concentrate on mainly French-speaking zones such as 
Africa, the Maghreb, or Latin America? 
  [Dutaret] The mission of Sofirad is to expand and to target 
traditional zones of French influence. I never believed that a 
Thai farmer would suddenly tune in to RFI at 1500 to listen to a 
program in Thai while he can receive 50 Thai stations. 
  [Brucy] So what should be done? 
  [Dutaret] RFI should broadcast in French. People listen to 
RFI to hear French. 
  [Brucy] Therefore no more RFI programs in foreign languages? 
  [Dutaret] If you want, but mostly in French. Listeners tune 
in to hear French. 
  [Mihail] How should this issue be coordinated? Do you see a 
role for France Television, together with Sofirad, to play an 
additional role so as to rationalize the activities of all 
existing bodies on this issue? There are six ministries 
concerned. 
  [Dutaret] France Television is already playing a role in 
Sofirad since one of its main announcers has been a member of 
the Sofirad board since last Monday. 
  [Brucy] He is Jean-Marie Cavada, he should be named. 
  [Dutaret] Therefore France Television is represented on the 
board. I do not believe anything more is necessary. If you 
consider the case of CFI, it must sell French programs, all of 
them, programs from public and private channels. One channel 
cannot be given preferential treatment. 
  [Mihail] A last question: don't you think it rather 
unhealthy 
to be both president of Sofirad and at the same time personal 
adviser to Communications Minister Carignon? Don't you believe 
that this represents the voice of France too? 
  [Dutaret] Do I look unhealthy? No, I am simply Alain 
Carignon's friendly adviser. This enables me to be very busy, 
to get up very early, as early as you do yourself, Roland. 
  [Brucy] Jean-Louis Dutaret, thank you.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Franco-German Squabbles"] </F>
  [Text] The words of French Ambassador to Germany Francois 
Scheer, as spoken to a number of German journalists, have caused 
a commotion in the federal capital. German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel and Chancellor Kohl interpreted the speculation 
about the new course of German foreign policy since unification 
as a demonstration of "distrust." 
  The questions raised by Mr. Scheer on Bonn's attitude 
regarding the enlargement of the European Union and the 
geopolitical uncertainties linked to the move of the capital 
from Bonn to Berlin are legitimate. They put the finger on one 
obvious element: Franco-German relations have changed profoundly 
since German unification, in terms of both style and content. 
  We are far removed today from the friendly relations between 
Roland Dumas and Hans-Dietrich Genscher. A less warm 
relationship has evolved between [French Foreign Minister] Alain 
Juppe and Klaus Kinkel; one which is marked by a coarser 
frankness. However, what has been lost in style has often been 
gained in efficiency. This was noticeable during the difficult 
GATT negotiations, where Bonn made a decisive contribution to 
the establishment of a compromise acceptable to Paris, and 
during the finalization of the European Union's joint position 
on Bosnia, whose only fault was that it came much too late. 
  In terms of substance, the incidents which have peppered 
Franco-German relations in recent days underline the need to 
update the alliance sealed in 1963 by Charles de Gaulle and 
Konrad Adenauer. It is no longer a question of closing ranks in 
order to confront the threat from the East. If good 
Franco-German cooperation is necessary today, it is because it 
is impossible to confront today's challenges alone: How can 
unemployment be tackled in France and Germany without 
harmonizing the monetary and budget policies of both countries? 
How can the European Union make progress without defining the 
correct way of combining enlargement with deepening? These are 
all problems which call for straightforward explanations, not 
ritualistic invocations of the "unfailing" nature of the 
Franco-German friendship. 
  It is true that the political timetable in both countries 
does not favor the smoothing out of accumulated differences. In 
the midst of a tough election campaign, Messrs. Kohl and Kinkel 
are tending to use a bit of muscle to rally the most 
conservative part of public opinion, which is very concerned 
about defending Germany's role in Europe and the world. In 
France, the differences in approach within the majority on 
European issues hinder the action of a government which has its 
eye set on the presidential elections in 1995. The 
Franco-German duo has certainly survived other disturbances in 
the past. However, the politicians would be well advised to 
calm a situation in which everyone has a lot to lose and not 
much to gain.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mino Martinazzoli, Italian Popular Party </F>
secretary, by unidentified correspondent in Piacenza; date not 
given: "The Center Is Better Than the Two Clowns" -- first two 
paragraphs are IL MESSAGGERO introduction] 
  [Text] It is 0800 AM. Piacenza is still drowsing, wreathed 
in a veil of mist. Mino Martinazzoli steps down from the 
sleeping car that has brought him up from Puglia and vanishes 
into a hotel. He begins the day's first election rally. He 
accuses [Achille] Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of 
the Left, PDS] of being "a Dr. Strangelove." The RAI [Italian 
Radio and Television]: "It is no good their inviting us to an 
extra debate to make up for all the time that they have taken 
away from us. What they ought to do is show us what happens in 
the wings, where the third-rate showmen who fawn on us from the 
right and left put on their silk stockings and plaster 
themselves with greasepaint. That way, everyone would realize 
that it is all a show." He has it in for the PDS again: "If 
what they call new is a throwback to [former communist party 
leader] Togliatti-style duplicity, I am becoming a reactionary. 
The new is on the way, and by that I mean way out." To Don 
Dossetti, who called on Catholics to subject themselves to a bit 
of purgatory, he replies: "We already have done so, while 
others are selling false paradises." The audience (not a very 
large one at this time of the morning) wakes up and claps. He 
goes on: A blow to the Left and a blow to the Right. 
  "Occhetto? He has been to London and has elevated Gramsci 
and Trotsky to the ranks of liberal-democratic thinkers." 
[Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi? "Those who are quick 
to promote their own interests are usually not so good at 
promoting other people's." What is more: "You get three for the 
price of one vote: Berlusconi, [Northern League Secretary 
Umberto] Bossi, and [National Alliance leader Giafranco] Fini. 
Berlusconi holds their hands, while they kick each other in the 
shins." The Mammi Act [on media ownership]? "The regulation of 
a sector like broadcasting is a matter of freedom. A public 
service in the true sense is a must, as is real pluralism on the 
private front." Bossi? "I have known lots like him in the 
taverns of Lombardy. Fun, but only there, in the taverns...." 
Fini? "I would buy an ice cream from him, but nothing more." 
  [Correspondent] What is it like, Senator Martinazzoli, at 
the 
center? In Rome they would say in the middle, as in "caught in 
the middle...." 
  [Martinazzoli] And they would be wrong... 
  [Correspondent] Mrs. Thatcher's adviser, the one who 
"updated" Macchiavelli's The Prince, said that those 
in the center get knocked down. 
  [Martinazzoli] Yes, if we are talking about the center of 
the 
road... 
  [Correspondent] But? 
  [Martinazzoli] But the center is a political point of view. 
It is not a matter of geography, but of ideals. 
  [Correspondent] According to MSI [Italian Social Movement] 
Secretary Fini, you are utterly failing to get into the game. 
You are at the center of a tennis court, watching the ball 
bounce backward and forward. 
  [Martinazzoli] What I really see is people battering one 
another over the head with their rackets, both on the Right and 
on the Left. Bossi versus Berlusconi. Occhetto versus 
[Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti. Just what sort of a game 
is this? 
  [Correspondent] There you are, you see: You want to umpire 
the game. 
  [Martinazzoli] No, all I ask is a bit of reasonableness. I 
am offering the Italians a serious pact. 
  [Correspondent] In a match played by others? 
  [Martinazzoli] No, in a match played by us as well. This is 
not a two-man race. It is like a cycling race. There will be 
candidates who will be voted in by just one vote, and the idea 
that there are those who have already won is simply grotesque. 
So I am calling for votes for the center. To win. 
  [Correspondent] Is that not an overambitious goal? 
  [Martinazzoli] Not at all. We are gaining ground. 
  [Correspondent] Is the center running to win? 
  [Martinazzoli] Why else should it be running? 
  [Correspondent] However, the opinion polls show you 
struggling. 
  [Martinazzoli] Claiming that our disappearance is 
inevitable, 
almost as if we had no right to be around, is a tactic devised 
to further the designs of the Right and the Left. 
  [Correspondent] To put it in a nutshell, you deny that a 
vote 
for the center would be a wasted vote, as Berlusconi and Fini 
are claiming? 
  [Martinazzoli] If I remember rightly, Fini lost against 
[Rome Mayor] Rutelli.... 
  [Correspondent] What do you mean by that? 
  [Martinazzoli] I should merely like to remind moderate 
Italians that the reason why the Left won the last local 
elections was that the center had been bombed, and its opponent 
was this highly radical Right. 
  [Correspondent] But now there is Berlusconi as well. 
  [Martinazzoli] This, in my opinion, merely aggravates the 
phenomenon, because Berlusconi's major contribution has been a 
thorough application of mass psychology. What you do is 
proclaim yourself the winner, invent a string of opinion polls 
predicting a landslide victory, and call on gamblers to bet on 
you, thus guaranteeing victory. But what do you win? Without 
political consistency, I fail to see what moral consistency 
success can have. 
  [Correspondent] Is this the reason why you did not side with 
Bossi and Berlusconi? 
  [Martinazzoli] The proposal that they made us for merging 
with their alliance was that we should disappear, no more and no 
less. It was an unacceptable option. 
  [Correspondent] Nevertheless, you have said that you are now 
watching the League with interest, explaining that it is "at a 
crossroads." 
  [Martinazzoli] Yes, it strikes me that it has reached a 
critical point of transition, that its strategic weakness is now 
emerging. Bossi could not keep the protest vote unless he could 
hold out a chance of entering government, which is why he sided 
with Berlusconi. But now he does not know how to explain to his 
supporters (who are tradespeople, manual workers, and small 
farmers) what they have in common with this capitalist. That is 
why he attacks him. It is an ambiguous position that, in my 
view, is worth watching. 
  [Correspondent] Do you mean that you are watching this side 
more than the other, expecting changes? 
  [Martinazzoli] Yes, I believe there could be developments on 
this front. More so than on others. 
  [Correspondent] [Pact for Italy member] Valerio Zanone has 
identified the League, AD [Democratic Alliance], and some 
fringes of Forza Italia as potential associates for the center 
in the event of no party winning outright and alliances having 
to be sought. Do you agree? 
  [Martinazzoli] Yes, although talk of this type tends to 
become excessively vague. If there is no outright winner, we 
must work out what the electorate was calling for with its vote. 
However, we shall definitely never enter into alliances with 
the Rete, the MSI, or Communist Renewal. 
  [Correspondent] But when you reject a government of 
"technicians," are you also rejecting the Ciampi hypothesis of 
an institutional, or caretaker government? 
  [Martinazzoli] I simply refuse to join in this pointless 
juggling with names. Apart from anything else it is 
unpleasant.... 
  [Correspondent] What is? 
  [Martinazzoli] That Ciampi's name should be taken in vain by 
the very people who never did anything to help him over recent 
months, and by that I mean the Left. We were the strength of 
the Ciampi government. As to the rest, my position concerns the 
limitations of "technical" governments in general. Politics 
must be brought back onto the field. 
  [Correspondent] It might be pointed out that Italy has had 
quite enough of incompetent politicians appointed ministers just 
because they were the leaders of this or that wing of a party. 
  [Martinazzoli] But you would have to be stone deaf to give 
what I said that meaning. I am not calling for a reversion to 
the old ways of conducting politics. What I want is to put 
authoritativeness back in politics. Because technical 
competence is not neutral. 
  [Correspondent] Which do you fear most: a victory for the 
Right or for the Left? 
  [Martinazzoli] In both cases, not I, but the Italians, ought 
to fear something. There is nothing reassuring in those camps. 
With their unrealistic promises, which they are not in a 
position to keep, Right and Left are the two sides of the same 
coin. 
  [Correspondent] And are you equidistant from both? 
  [Martinazzoli] I have already said that if I win I shall 
govern, and if not I shall go into opposition. 
  [Correspondent] And if nobody wins? 
  [Martinazzoli] I repeat: We shall have to work out what the 
electorate is demanding of us. As to the allegation that we are 
the Trojan horse of the Left, my answer is: Stop pestering me 
with this nonsense. That is not the way it is. If the Left has 
been kept out of government in this country, the merit is ours, 
not anybody else's. 
  [Correspondent] Do you regret passing the law adopting this 
electoral system? 
  [Martinazzoli] It was the only one possible. We are not its 
only progenitors. It was the...least common denominator. 
  [Correspondent] There is talk of changing it, perhaps 
turning 
it into a two-tier system. 
  [Martinazzoli] I have no hesitation about saying that it 
should be corrected if possible. 
  [Correspondent] How? 
  [Martinazzoli] Moving toward a two-tier system; not the one 
with a second ballot. That way they will no longer be able to 
say that the center is against alternation. The center is 
against a crazy, deceitful idea of alternation. 
  [Correspondent] Who is it that is lying? 
  [Martinazzoli] Those who appeal for votes from the center 
and 
then retreat into their right-wing or left-wing strongholds, 
doing deals with their extremist fringes. 
  [Correspondent] But if all this had not happened, where 
would 
the Popular Party be? On the Right or on the Left? 
  [Martinazzoli] As far as I am concerned, the answer would be 
easy. I am not a man of the left. Be that as it may, the party 
would have had to reflect on this scenario. 
  [Correspondent] Does Catholic unity in politics still have 
any meaning? 
  [Martinazzoli] What I defend is a tradition, values. I force 
no one. Of course, I would not want Catholics to take up arms 
to defend somebody else's values. 
  [Correspondent] Do you agree with [Interior Minister] 
Mancino 
on the Mafia vote? 
  [Martinazzoli] I do not know what information Mancino has. 
All I know is that the Mafia will certainly not be voting for 
us. 
  [Correspondent] Who will be the next secretary of the 
Popular 
Party? 
  [Martinazzoli] I do not know. As far as I am concerned, if I 
succeed in upholding the future of our tradition in this 
difficult moment of transition, I shall be content. I shall 
have done my bit. 
  [Correspondent] So you confirm that you will not be running 
for the party leadership again? 
  [Martinazzoli] Precisely. 
  [Correspondent] Do you have a favorite of your own for the 
succession? 
  [Martinazzoli] No. 
  [Correspondent] Not even a short list? 
  [Martinazzoli] Neither a short list nor a Rosy [Bindi].

<F P=106> [Editorial by Indro Montanelli: "Where Were We?"] </F>
  [Text] I think that any presentation would be superfluous. 
It is us, those you already know, almost all of us. We hope 
that we will have just as many readers, from whom we have 
received touching demonstrations of affection and solidarity 
during these months of forced silence. I think that none of 
them, seeing IL GIORNALE today--as its editor (the real one) 
wanted it, of course--can still have any doubts over the 
necessity, in which we found ourselves, to leave it. These 
words are by no means intended to be controversial: to each his 
own ideas and above all, his own style. Ours induces us to 
immediately clarify certain points to those readers who will 
want to follow us. 
  The first concerns the shareholders of LA VOCE. Upon leaving 
IL GIORNALE I swore to myself in public: "Never again an 
owner." There are no owners here. The ownership is divided 
among 100 or so shareholders none of whom, by statute, can hold 
more than 4 percent. First among these are all of us: the 
editorial staff, clerks, messengers, drivers. But anyone can 
become a shareholder as of now with one or more 500,000 lire 
shares: All he must do is submit an application and he will 
become a "partner" in LA VOCE. This shareholding has been 
defined by the high ranks of the financial world as being a 
"ragamuffin" because of its dustheap nature. We do not dislike 
this term: At this time it is better to stay among the rags 
than among the kickbacks. 
  The second commitment to our readers is our independence 
from 
any political force, even if we will have to opt for one of 
these on 27 March and everybody is asking us--by letter, 
telephone, on the street, to the point of being 
asphyxiating--which it will be. This is a matter that we will 
begin to face tomorrow, but we can make a premise: Even if we 
do succeed in formulating one, it will be a preference with a 
condition. A recent experience, which we do not want to repeat, 
gave us firsthand experience in the incompatibility of our way 
of being with the manners of the politicians and their palace, 
with whom we do not want to have anything to do. (The author 
thinks that he has already demonstrated this by refusing to go 
and occupy one of the more comfortable seats.) No preliminary 
question of sympathy or ill will can succeed in breaking up our 
equidistance from the forces in the field and from their 
representatives. If, for example, the Knight [Berlusconi 
nickname] were to line up with the positions that long before 
being his were and remain ours, by giving up that man of 
providence attitude that takes away any credibility from his big 
words, we will give him a loyal hand. We intend to do this 
solely as free men and journalists and not as the master's 
clerks and buglers. Who knows if the master will see the 
difference. But I think the reader will appreciate it. 
  Third commitment: The language. I do not know if there are 
still Italians who can distinguish between firmness and 
virulence and who prefer calm reasoning and talk to shouts and 
invectives. I doubt so, given the triumphant audience reached by 
the Olympics of charlatanism and scurrilous language that 
television in particular--public and private--delights us with 
in the evening. However, whether they are few or many, we will 
address ourselves to these readers in the hope that they will 
appreciate us. This is why we chose this masthead. At the 
beginning of the century LA VOCE, thanks to its founder 
Prezzolini, was an arena, not only of great culture, but also of 
high journalistic civility. We do not aspire to reaching this 
level but are resolute in honoring the name, primarily in style. 
  Postscripts. In order to be on the newsstand before 27 
March, LA VOCE bet the Guinness Book of Records with 
its two month preparations. Our readers should pardon any 
starting defects: We will correct them as we go. 
  Second. LA VOCE will not be published on Mondays and will 
cost 1,500 lire. We are the first to regret this. But, since 
we can only count on our own resources, we had no other means of 
balancing the accounts. We hope that our readers will find that 
the quality of the product compensates for the higher price.

<F P=106> [Interview with Achille Occhetto, Democratic Party of the </F>
Left secretary, by Gabriele Paci; place and date not given: "I 
Promise Sacrifices"] 
  [Text] [Paci] Honorable Occhetto, if the "progressive pole" 
wins, with whom will you govern Italy, and what will you do? 
  [Occhetto] First, continue with the politics of 
economic-financial recovery and elimination of the government 
deficit begun by the Ciampi government. In fact, this is the 
premise for saving the lira, attracting foreign investors -- 
whom I had the opportunity to convince even during my recent 
trips in Europe -- and to launch a serious employment policy. 
  [Paci] What do you mean by "serious?" 
  [Occhetto] It means that, on the basis of previous 
statements, employment policy needs a strong innovation. The 
old social policy of the Left was reflected in short-term 
programs. We avoided them this time. Instead, we presented a 
program in which all the policies -- financial, economic, social 
-- converge, I would say in an almost obsessive manner, in a 
single objective: employment. 
  [Paci] Even the Center and Right pledge a great commitment 
to 
employment. 
  [Occhetto] Saying to the Italians: We will resolve your 
problems in one day, means acting like showmen. Instead, we are 
saying to the Italians: Even if the progressives win, we will 
have to pull up our shirt sleeves, and to make sacrifices to 
achieve the objectives of recovery and employment. Of course, 
everybody will have to make sacrifices, possibly starting with 
all those who have never made any for the past 50 years. 
  [Paci] And the welfare state? 
  [Occhetto] The traditional policy of the welfare state can 
be 
revised without affecting productivity and austerity. 
  [Paci] I repeat, with which forces, would you actuate the 
policy of the "progressives?" 
  [Occhetto] With the forces that are willing to implement it. 
Do not forget that already in the past, an extremely vast front 
was constituted to win the referendum. 
  [Paci] Therefore, everything will be like during the times 
of 
proportional representation: First the elections and then the 
parties decide which majority to form. 
  [Occhetto] No, I refuse this proportional reasoning. I would 
rather say that there is a progressive, center, and right bloc, 
and it would therefore be desirable for one of these to win the 
elections and govern. 
  [Paci] But if none of the three wins... 
  [Occhetto] Then we will make a responsible commitment to 
find 
the forces that can implement a recovery program, not a program 
of the Left, in parliament. At that point we should all 
reexamine ourselves, even myself. 
  [Paci] And the premier of such a nonleft recovery program, 
would be Ciampi. 
  [Occhetto] I respect Ciampi who has said that he places 
himself above the parties, even mine, and I consider him a 
reserve for democracy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Admiral Fuzeta da Ponte, Armed Forces chief </F>
of staff, by Jose Manuel Saraiva; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Saraiva] The EMGFA [Armed 
Forces General Staff] is a very bureaucratic structure. What 
will you do to make this body effective, open, and perhaps more 
modern? 
  [Fuzeta] In the first place, I will have to concern myself 
with a rigorous assessment of the degrees of readiness and 
maintenance of the Armed Forces. Over the past few years we 
have witnessed profound changes in the Armed Forces, ranging 
from the initiation of new laws governing the body to the new 
personnel recruitment and pay systems, with a view to the 
greater effectiveness of the Armed Forces. The changes in the 
EMGFA form part of a broader plan that I wish to implement and 
whose aim is to assess the final outcome of those changes. 
  [Saraiva] Do you believe that the material and human 
resources of the Armed Forces are sufficient to implement that 
plan? 
  [Fuzeta] No military chief anywhere in the world deems the 
available resources sufficient. In the first place, the needs 
are always very great. We must acknowledge that a great deal 
has been done in Portugal to improve the Armed Forces. This is 
a fact that must be acknowledged, but we must also remember that 
the recovery of the Armed Forces started from a very low 
point.... 
  [Saraiva] What do you mean by that? 
  [Fuzeta] I mean that our Armed Forces were already obsolete. 
Their modernization depends on the level of investment, which 
means that the greater the resources allocated to the Armed 
Forces, the more rapidly they will be able to achieve their 
aims. We are never satisfied. 
  [Saraiva] How do you explain young people's enormous lack of 
motivation to serve the Armed Forces? 
  [Fuzeta] This is a very serious matter. Over the years, the 
Portuguese people have always known how to defend the 
fatherland. They have always found considerable motivation to 
that end. Hence the motivation to serve the Armed Forces 
depends to some extent on the perception of the threats 
surrounding society at a given time. An individual immersed in a 
society over which looms a threat of disruption of peace is more 
motivated to serve the country than in the contrary situation. 
Moreover, it is important that it be said that something has 
been done to improve the motivation of the personnel serving in 
the Armed Forces. For instance, for career professionals the 
modernization of the new resources is a highly motivating 
factor. Any Army professional likes to have his M-60's, any Air 
Force man eagerly awaits the F-16's; naturally, any sailor is 
pleased with the Vasco da Gama-class frigates. With respect to 
the contract and volunteer personnel, in addition to these 
aspects we are also motivating them through accelerated 
vocational training, so that, after serving in the ranks, they 
will be reintegrated into civilian life. However, it is in 
education that the values that lead the Portuguese people to 
love their fatherland are instilled, and it is imparted in the 
schools and at home. 
  [Saraiva] With respect to the so-called performance of 
military duties, which system do you prefer -- compulsory 
military service or the volunteer and contract system? 
  [Fuzeta] The matter is eminently political. This is an 
important debate that should be conducted in the proper forum. 
Technically, there are Armed Forces that have opted for the 
volunteer system -- for instance, Britain -- and others that 
have chosen the compulsory system, such as France, and have not 
lost effectiveness on that account. I mean by this that it is 
possible to have effective Armed Forces both with the volunteer 
system and with the conscript system. In any event, no system 
is pure. All are hybrids. Right now, we have a roster of 
volunteers, but in the event of a crisis or war, we would still 
have to resort to general mobilization. 
  [Saraiva] You referred to vocational training aimed at the 
contractees and volunteers. Does the setting up of these 
institutes have any parallel in the armed forces of other 
countries? 
  [Fuzeta] There are similar measures in several European 
countries -- specifically, in France. 
  [Saraiva] But in Portugal this is a recent innovation whose 
sole aim seems to be to attract less-qualified young people to 
join up. 
  [Fuzeta] This is in the tradition of the great services to 
the nation performed by the Armed Forces. For many years, 
compulsory military service to some extent compensated for the 
basic education that was not given in the schools. It is well 
known that many young people from the poorest families who came 
from the most disadvantaged regions found a basic education in 
the forces, but now that tradition in the Armed Forces is 
exercised in a more sophisticated way. 
  [Saraiva] But there are those actually within the Armed 
Forces who say that the fighting military component could be 
disadvantaged for the benefit of a vocational training for which 
the forces are not, at first sight, designed? 
  [Fuzeta] On the contrary. We can only have fighting forces 
in Portugal if they are very well trained. We must have small, 
but good forces. There can be no good fighter without good 
training. So the vocational training process helps modernize the 
Armed Forces, and if that training can be projected outside, so 
as to benefit those whom have performed military service, I can 
see no harm in our civilianizing the training that we currently 
give young people. 
  [Saraiva] What role should the Armed Forces have in the 
prevailing international situation? 
  [Fuzeta] It is, of course, different from what it was five 
years ago, owing to the reduction in intensity of the East-West 
conflict. At that time, there was still a large number of 
forces settled on various fronts and with little flexibility. 
Today, the scene is completely different. In the current 
multipolar system we are witnessing several regional conflicts 
that require limited but well-trained and more flexible Armed 
Forces. In Portugal we must transform the Armed Forces, 
precisely so that we can use them strictly in Portugal's 
interest on the international scene. 
  [Saraiva] Do you believe that Portugal should participate 
more in international crises? For instance, during the Gulf 
war, some military men argued that the Portuguese Armed Forces 
should have taken part more actively in the conflict. 
  [Fuzeta] That is a political matter. It is the political 
power that decides on involvement of the Armed Forces. However, 
I will simply say that Portugal should act in the just defense 
of its interests. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Athens considers the latest U.S. Government moves 
as a good omen for the U.S. stance on the issue of The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. Following the 
appointment of a special coordinator, the State Department 
issued a notice enforcing the use of The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia for Skopje. Foivos Karzis has the 
following report: 
  [Begin Foivos Karsis recording] The State Department notice 
actually prohibits its officials from mentioning Skopje using 
the name of Macedonia under the pretext of brevity or 
simplification. The Greek Government is obviously satisfied with 
this development, since it sees this as a continuation of a 
positive climate that prevails in Washington, such as the 
appointment of Mr. Matthew Nimetz as the State Department's 
special envoy. [end recording] 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou also made a 
statement on the importance of the State Department notice to 
our correspondent Nina Asimakopoulou. 
  [Begin recording] [Papandreou] The significance is that our 
country's sensitivity toward this problem is recognized in the 
most official way by the United States. If one combines this 
with President Clinton's latest announcement that he would not 
establish diplomatic relations with the FYROM until Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou visits the United States, and with 
the announcement that Mr. Nimetz has been appointed U.S. special 
envoy, then we can see the U.S. political will to contribute 
positively toward the efforts for a just solution to this 
problem. 
  [Asimakopoulou] Do you believe that the Greek Government's 
measures have brought about results? 
  [Papandreou] I believe that they have received the message 
that Greece considers this issue a very serious one, as we have 
been indicating for months during our contacts and discussions. 
This has been achieved not only by the Greek Government, but 
citizens of the United States have also played a significant 
role. [end recording] 
  The government spokesman also described the U.S. State 
Department decision as positive and noted that similar 
developments also took place in Australia, where the government 
decided that, until the dispute over the Skopje name is 
resolved, the Skopjeans will be officially called 
Slavomacedonians. 
  These moves by Washington also show a clear [word 
indistinct] 
of the climate that the U.S. Government desires to formulate in 
view of the prime minister's upcoming visit to the White House. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou will leave for the 
United States tomorrow to prepare for the prime minister's 
visit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] European Union [EU] Commissioner Jacques Delors has 
sent another letter to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou asking 
the Greek Government to raise the issue of the embargo against 
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] at the EU 
Council of Ministers. According to Community observers, this 
request indicates that the possibility of referring Greece to 
the European Court has lost momentum. Correspondent Mairi Savva 
reports from Brussels: 
  [Savva] EU Commission President Jacques Delors has sent 
another letter to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou regarding 
the FYROM. In his letter, Delors asks the Greek Government to 
raise the issue of the economic embargo at the EU Council of 
Foreign Ministers. Political observers in Brussels view this 
move as another goodwill gesture from the Commission, which 
right now does not want to lodge a complaint against Greece at 
the European Court. 
  After the extraordinary Council of Ministers meeting ended, 
Delors and Theodhoros Pangalos, the alternate foreign affairs 
minister and EU president, gave a joint news conference. 
Unfortunately, no agreement was reached on the major political 
issue of how to make decisions after the EU expands. The 
Commission and 10 member states favor an arithmetical adjustment 
when decisions are made, with a special majority so as not to 
make decisionmaking any more difficult. Britain and Spain have 
strongly protested; and the European Parliament now may not 
ratify the expansion if this is done according to the solution 
proposed by these two countries. The issue will be discussed 
next weekend during the informal EU Foreign Ministers meetings 
in Ioannina, which will not deal exclusively with the great 
political problems that concern the EU, such as the former 
Yugoslavia and the situation in the Middle East.

  [Excerpt] Istanbul, Mar.22 (A.A.) -- Democracy Party (DEP) 
members Mahmut Kilinc and Zubeyir Aydar flew to the United 
States today to meet with the UN Human Rights Commission and 
congressional members. 
  Before their departure, Aydar and Kilinc, both from 
southeast 
Turkey, said that their objective was not to complain about 
Turkey. 
  They said that they were to appear before the commission so 
that their friends, currently in prison, will receive a just 
trial. 
  The DEP, which has 13 seats in the 450-seat parliament, has 
been the focus of angry public reaction in Turkey, especially 
because its members refused to condemn or criticize the bloody 
attacks of the separatist terror organization PKK [Workers Party 
of Kurdistan]. The PKK has been waging a bloody campaign against 
the Turkish state which has claimed nearly 11,000 lives over the 
last 10 years. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seven human rights workers in a British 
Parliamentary delegation have been arrested by security forces 
in southeastern Turkey, according to colleagues and the 
Kurdistan Information Centre in London. 
  The Foreign Office said they were aware of the reports but 
had no independent confirmation. 
  A spokesman said: "The embassy in Ankara is in touch with 
the 
Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs." 
  The group, investigating alleged abuse of human rights, was 
seized by Turkish military officials in the village of Malabadi, 
some 20 miles from Diyarbakir, main town in Turkey's Kurdish 
region. 
  They are part of a 24-strong delegation headed by Lord 
Avebury, chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group. 
  A colleague in one of the three other groups elsewhere in 
Turkey said the seven were travelling by car from Diyarbakir 
when seized at Malabadi at around 8am London time yesterday. 
Nothing further had been heard from them by 8.30pm. They are 
human rights campaigner Miranda Watson from Peterborough, 
barrister Joy Hankins from London, and an interpreter known only 
as Mr Diyviren, thought to be from Sheffield. 
  Also in the team are Margaret Ward, Kevin MacDermot and 
Felan 
McMahon, all from Ireland and New Zealander Peter Grant. 
  The group is the latest of several observer teams to go to 
south-east Turkey to investigate allegations of massacres, 
arrests and burning of villages by security forces in response 
to a campaign by Kurdish separatists. 
  Other British human rights investigators on a similar 
mission 
were arrested in the same area last November and released after 
26 hours.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kemal Burkay, leader of the Kurdistan </F>
Socialist Party, PSK, in Iraq, by Mithat Bereket in northern 
Iraq from the "32d Day" program; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Burkay] We could have resorted to arms just as the 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. We did not opt for terrorism 
because we were aware that the price would be too high and we 
see that now. We supported a peaceful political struggle to 
develop a solution to the issue until unfortunately we were 
stopped. Once an organization like ours, which prefers a 
peaceful political struggle, gets involved in terrorism it is 
restricted. 
  [Bereket] You had certain opportunities, such as access to 
the DEP [Democracy Party] representation in the parliament. Do 
you think that the DEP used this opportunity to its advantage? 
  [Burkay] I do not think that the DEP has made good use of 
the parliament. In the beginning they undertook demonstrative 
actions. They could have undertaken wiser actions. However, the 
DEP was not even given the opportunity for these actions. I do 
not think that the DEP politicians have much experience. How do 
you expect them to have experience when the Kurdish movement 
receives big [word indistinct] every three, five, or 10 years. 
Under these circumstances, the politically experienced are being 
pushed out of the political arena therefore leaving the way open 
for less experienced individuals who were not given an 
opportunity to express themselves. 
  [Bereket] You are very cautious when assessing the recent 
suggestions of Apo [PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan] and are 
refraining from commenting on the proposals submitted by the 
PKK. Do you believe that the real solution lies in discussion? 
  [Burkay] The important thing is to see that the solution to 
this issue lies in dialogue, whatever the reasons for the PKK 
proposals. The issue is political, therefore political channels 
should be open. As we see it, this can be achieved and the 
chaos of today -- the dirty war -- stopped. The prospects of 
the country should not be wasted. The young people of the 
country should not die in vain. Our country should not be 
transformed into hell and it is possible to prevent this. The 
government can prevent this. 
  [Bereket] Would you cease your struggle for independence and 
coexist in Turkey if the government grants you the right to 
establish Kurdish schools, television, and radio? 
  [Burkay] Being considered equal means independence. I think 
the source of the problem is inequality and pressure. I believe 
that under the basis of equality everybody can live in 
brotherhood, and I think that the Kurds would not even think nor 
want a separation. I think that two peoples coexisting is much 
more beneficial -- for both sides -- than their separation and 
will stop migration. Of course, it is better to achieve 
success by a peaceful democratic process and therefore avoid 
more bloodshed. 
  [Bereket] Why don't you, as the PSK try and emerge as an 
alternative to the PKK? 
  [Burkay] We were not established as an alternative to the 
PKK. We were established in 1974, before the PKK, and we have 
our own program. We work within the framework of this program. 
  [Bereket] Has the Turkish state approached you against the 
PKK? Has it searched for ways to establish a dialogue with you? 
  [Burkay] We have sent our messages to the Turkish state and 
government by the use of various channels -- press statements 
and interviews I've done. These statements have also been 
published in Turkey. I sent a long letter to Mrs. Ciller when 
she formed the government. I indicated my views in that letter 
and submitted various proposals for a peaceful solution to the 
issue. Unfortunately, as I have said before, these calls of mine 
have received no responses. 
  [Bereket] What will be the PSK's stand during the 27 March 
elections? 
  [PSK Central Committee member Unal Yardimci] We have issued 
messages stating that patriotic democratic candidates should be 
supported wherever they are and that citizens everywhere should 
cast their votes. 
  [Bereket] Do you believe that in case a political solution 
is found to the Kurdish issue the PKK will disappear and new 
balances established? 
  [Burkay] We do not find the PKK's policies that agreeable. 
Nobody has [word indistinct] the PKK as much as us but you 
cannot conduct politics in Turkey without first recognizing the 
PKK. For that reason, the state should recognize the PKK. We 
are impartial in this issue. Both community and political life 
will be reshaped when new democratic conditions are established. 
There are other Kurdish organizations apart from us. It could 
be that other powerful Kurdish organizations may develop from 
the PKK and us. The road that will enable this formation should 
be open.

<F P=106> [Greg McIvor report: "Norway Deal Hits Rough Waters"] </F>
  [Text] Stockholm -- Norwegian fishermen and farmers 
yesterday denounced their government's deal on European Union 
[EU] membership as a betrayal of coastal and rural communities. 
  The agreement was reached on Tuesday night [15 March] after 
Spain and Portugal accepted an extra quota of 6,000 tonnes of 
fish from Norwegian waters. The EU will take control of Norway's 
fishing grounds in 1998. 
  The prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, said Norway had 
achieved a fair deal. "I believe we have gone a long way to 
meeting the goals we set ourselves," she said. A referendum is 
due to be held later this year. 
  Jan Henry Olsen, the fisheries minister, said during 
negotiations that Norway had "not one single cod" to give the 
EU, but had to give way to placate Spain and Portugal. 
  Mr Olsen, who had long been an opponent of EU membership, 
said he had been converted to the yes camp by the merits of the 
deal. 
  But Einar Hepsoe, chairman of the Norwegian fishermen's 
association, said the deal was a disaster, which gave "no 
guarantee for our futures, nor for our children's futures." 
  Although Norway's fishing fleets employ only 26,000 people 
and contribute less than 3 percent of GDP (Gross Domestic 
Product), the industry is a precious national symbol. Fishing 
communities are dotted along the 1,700-mile coastline and 
keeping them alive through generous state aid is fundamental to 
government policy. 
  Although the EU has promised to adopt Norwegian rules for 
control of catches and resource management after 1998, fishermen 
are anxious about what happens when EU fishery policy is 
reviewed in 2002. They fear EU vessels will be allowed into 
Norway's 12 mile exclusion zone, where 70 percent of the 
nation's fish is caught. 
  Discontent in fishing communities is mirrored among farmers, 
who face the loss of high state subsidies. Farming 
organisations claim half of Norway's 90,000 agricultural workers 
will be forced out of business in an open market. 
  Bjorn Iversen, leader of the Norwegian Farmers' Union, said 
farmers would unite with fishermen in campaigning for a no vote 
in the referendum. 
  In 1972, Norwegians voted against membership of the then EEC 
after Brussels adopted a common fisheries policy without 
consulting Norway. The political fallout split the ruling Labour 
Party. 
  Opinion polls do not augur well for a positive result now. 
Around 44 percent oppose membership and 28 percent are in 
favour, although the gap has narrowed in recent weeks.

<F P=106> [Reports by Lionel Barber and David Gardner in Brussels and </F>
Kevin Brown in London: "MEP's Rule Out EU Voting Compromise"] 
  [Text] France and Germany will exert heavy pressure on 
Britain and Spain today to try to resolve the crisis over voting 
rights in an enlarged European Union [EU]. 
  Neither London nor Madrid appeared ready last night to 
soften 
their position at today's meeting of foreign ministers in 
Brussels. The issue may force the EU to delay a decision on new 
voting arrangements, jeopardising an already tight timetable for 
the entry of Finland, Sweden Austria and Norway into the Union 
by January 1, 1995. 
  The European Parliament further damped hopes of a solution 
being reached today. The largest group in the Strasbourg 
assembly, the Socialists, rejected the compromise being offered 
to Britain and Spain. 
  Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the Socialist MEPs, said: 
"What is at stake is the whole concept of a future Europe." 
  The European Parliament has to approve the accession treaty 
by May 4 to make it possible for the four newcomers to enter by 
January. But the Strasbourg assembly has said it will withhold 
assent if Britain and Spain win their demands to retain the 
"blocking minority" at 23 votes in the Council of Ministers 
allowing one small and two large member states to obstruct 
decisions. 
  London and Madrid's 10 partners insist that the blocking 
threshold should rise to 27, since the weighted votes in Council 
will rise from 76 to 90. But as a compromise, they are prepared 
to offer a two-month delay on decisions which are opposed by 23 
votes, to try to get consensus. 
  Mr Cot said yesterday: "There is no chance of having any 
sort of mixed solution go through (the European) Parliament, 
such as a two-month cooling-off period, which would only 
exacerbate delays in decision-making." 
  Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, repeated that Britain was 
determined to keep the weight of voting power with the larger EU 
states. "The situation now, where two large and one small 
country can block a decision, is perfectly satisfactory," he 
said in Brussels. "I am not prepared to see a situation develop 
where a collection small states can vote down a collection of 
bigger ones." 
  Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was more conciliatory, 
but indicated that it was unlike that a solution could be 
reached today. The Union had to find a way through the voting 
impasse he said, during a visit to Dublin. "We may not do so in 
Brussels tomorrow (Tuesday), but we will persevere until we do." 
  In Paris, the French foreign ministry, quoted by Reuter, 
said 
France and Germany would still press for a solution at today's 
meeting. "There are ways to take account of some countries' 
concerns." 
  Mr Clarke said it was wrong to assume that enlargement 
automatically meant changes to make decision-making easier at 
the expense of the minority. 
  But an EU diplomat said all 12 member states, including 
Britain, had agreed at the EU summit in Lisbon in June 1992 that 
the admission of the four Nordic and Alpine countries would 
require a "mechanical" adjustment in voting weights. A senior 
Brussels diplomat played down speculation about a special summit 
to break the impasse.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, March 22 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] 
foreign ministers remained deadlocked here Tuesday [22 March] in 
an escalating crisis over how to adjust the decision-making 
rules of the expanding Union. 
  The quarrel, which has set Britain and Spain against their 
10 
EU partners, is blocking the entry of Austria, Finland, Norway 
and Sweden into the Union by a target date of January 1 next 
year. 
  Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said there had been 
no 
movement in negotiations Tuesday and that no acceptable 
compromise was in sight. "We're not moving. It's a position of 
principle," he said over Spain's refusal to allow any weakening 
of its ability to block decisions when new members are accepted. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said: "I am not very 
hopeful of reaching an answer today. ... So far we do not have 
on the table a proposal satisfactory to Britain." 
  Earlier the Belgian, Dutch, German, French and Luxembourg 
ministers, who oppose the British-Spanish stand, all expressed 
doubt that the quarrel could be overcome at Tuesday's meeting -- 
the fourth in so many weeks. 
  Dutch diplomats said 10 of the EU's 12 countries had 
hardened 
their refusal against compromise to satisfy the British and 
Spanish demands. 
  On the sidelines of the meeting, Swedish European Affairs 
Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel warned that the dispute could affect 
the chances of the Swedish electorate accepting entry into the 
Union. 
  The four applicants, which completed negotiations to join 
the 
EU earlier this month, must all hold referendums before the end 
of the year to ratify their membership accords. 
  Asked whether the EU quarrel could turn the Swedish 
electorate against EU membership, Dinkelspiel said: "Yes, 
certainly" -- an answer which diplomats say applies equally to 
the other three applicants. 
  Commenting on Tuesday's meeting, French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe said: "Nobody is moving. Better no accord than a 
bad accord." 
  Spain is backing the British position that the enlargement 
of 
the EU should not dilute the power of the Union's bigger 
countries to block decisions they do not like. 
  The Spanish want to maintain the power of three countries to 
block unpopular decisions. The British want to brake the 
accelerating shift of power from EU governments to a central 
authority. 
  The rest of the 12-nation Union want the threshold of 
blocking majorities raised from 23 votes out of 76 to 27 out of 
90 to take account of the incoming members. 
  But this would weaken the ability of the EU's bigger 
countries to block controversial decisions, because a coalition 
of one small and two large countries could no longer make their 
"no" stick. 
  The issue involves a balance of power between north and 
south, between big countries and small, between free traders and 
protectionists. 
  Prominent members of the European Parliament have warned the 
Euro-Parliament will not ratify the enlargement accords if 
concessions are made to Britain and Spain. 
  Euro-MP Jean Cot said Tuesday: "The British will be to blame 
if the enlargement fails. They want to widen Europe but they 
are trying to weaken it too." 
  Cot is the leader of the Socialist group, the largest bloc 
in 
the Euro-Parliament. "Douglas Hurd is playing with fire," he 
said, adding that the parliament would accept no compromise to 
satisfy the British or Spanish. 
  But Hurd insisted that Britain had no intention of 
jeopardising the enlargement of the EU to take in the four 
applicants. "We intend to work until we get a satisfactory 
result," he said. 
  If there is no agreement Tuesday, the issue is likely to 
dominate a meeting of the EU foreign ministers at Ioannina, in 
northwest Greece, Saturday and Sunday.

<F P=106> ["now" report: "EU Council of Ministers Reaches No Result </F>
in Dispute Over Blocking Minority"] 
  [Excerpt] Brussels, 22 March -- At the fourth meeting in 
three weeks of the foreign ministers of the European Union (EU), 
held on Tuesday [22 March], no result was achieved in the 
dispute over the future blocking minority in the Council of 
Ministers. After several hours of talks Foreign Minister Kinkel 
said in the afternoon: "I do not see any progress here or any 
chance of a breakthrough today." In the evening the efforts of 
Greek European Affairs Minister Pangalos, current president of 
the EU Council, failed to persuade the foreign ministers of 
Britain and Spain, Hurd and Solana, to accept a compromise with 
the other 10 EU partners and would-be members Finland, Norway, 
Sweden, and Austria on the issue of the blocking minority in an 
enlarged EU. Already the three previous rounds of talks in the 
Council of Ministers had failed because of London and Madrid's 
refusal to accept a change in the blocking minority from the 
current 23 out of 76 votes to a future 27 out of 90 votes. 
After an agreement had been reached with Norway on the fishery 
dispute, membership negotiations with the three Scandinavian 
countries and with Austria were concluded last week, with the 
exception of the issue of the future rules for voting in the 
Council of Ministers. 
  After the public controversy about Foreign Minister Kinkel's 
way of conducting negotiations during the membership talks, on 
Tuesday the German minister and his French colleague Juppe 
demonstratively went to the meeting in Brussels with a 
coordinated position. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Road to the Economic and Monetary Union </F>
(EMU)"] 
  [Text] Denmark is two months into the second phase of the 
Economic and Monetary Union. Probably few people have noticed 
it. However the government has taken the opportunity to issue a 
report on Denmark's economic cooperation in the European Union 
(EU). According to the preface by the economic affairs minister, 
it should also serve as a starting point for the campaign prior 
to the European Parliament elections in June. 
  The report says that adjusting the economy to the strict 
requirements in phase two is going well. This phase is the last 
before the planned freeze of exchange rates and the introduction 
of a common currency. In other words, phrase three, where 
Denmark has slammed on the brakes. There is reason to ask why it 
is so essential to follow the process to the halfway point. Is 
the lesson from the monetary policy events in 1992 and 1993 
beginning to sink in or does this indicate distaste for the 
prospect of a somewhat higher interest level in this country in 
relation to the core of the European and Monetary Union (EMU)? 
  Phase two, which is now under way, is a transition stage 
with 
respect to monetary cooperation. Monetary and economic stability 
must be ensured before the irrevocable step of freezing exchange 
rates and establishing a joint currency is taken. That is the 
logical aim of the substance of the transition phase. 
  Economic policy cooperation is expanded in phase two, among 
other things through the so-called convergence programs, which 
are updated continually. About 10 days ago the government 
delivered the Danish convergence program to the EU Commission. 
The convergence programs are intended to demonstrate that the 
individual countries are moving their economic policies toward 
the goals that are necessary in order to reach phase three, and 
this is evaluated primarily on the basis of the degree of price 
stability, the public budget deficit, long-term interest rates, 
and exchange rate fluctuations in relation to the old European 
Monetary System (EMS) margin. In the government's opinion this 
will not cause big problems where Denmark is concerned, as long 
as a number of economic factors also develop as expected, of 
course. Here the assumption of a growth of 0.5 percent in public 
consumption starting next year is an especially interesting test 
of credibility. 
  A more basic question, however, is what the government 
intends to do if the test is passed. The second phase is meant 
to involve a gradual merger with phase three's assurance of 
monetary stability and lower interest rates. By the very nature 
of the case this outcome will apply only to the participants and 
thus not to Denmark. It seems a little strange that a question 
was raised a few days ago about reestablishing the old EMS 
cooperation when the new report says that returning to the 
situation that existed before 2 August 1993 will hardly be 
possible.

<F P=106> [News conference by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl with </F>
foreign and domestic correspondents in Bonn on 23 March -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Kohl] Ladies and Gentlemen, let me start with a 
comment on the recent violence and the highway blockades by the 
Kurd extremists. The terrorism by these groups has taken on a 
new dimension. It is an unacceptable abuse of our hospitality 
that we, under no circumstances will or can accept. The 
perpetrators must be aware that they will have to expect tough 
punishments and also deportation. We will have to see whether 
the current law on foreigners offers a sufficient basis. If 
this is not the case, we will have to look at changes to the law 
as soon as possible. I think the talks that the federal 
interior minister is having today with his colleagues from the 
federal states will also bring progress on this. 
  Here in Germany the federal states are primarily responsible 
for public security and law and order. For this reason I want 
to appeal to the federal states here to do justice to their 
responsibility for peace within the country. I also want to 
offer the closest possible cooperation with the federal 
government. We will grant the federal states, if they wish it, 
all the support that is necessary. 
  Approximately 1.8 million Turkish citizens live in Germany, 
about 450,000 of them being Kurds and, according to our 
information, about 40,000 of these Kurds are PKK [Kurdistan 
Workers Party] sympathizers. For decades we have been living in 
peace with the great majority of our fellow Turkish citizens 
with good neighborly relations. Things have to stay this way. 
Precisely for this reason we have to protect ourselves from a 
violent minority and, if necessary, take severe measures against 
them. Anyone who plays down and tolerates the terrorism by 
foreign extremists, supports xenophobia and thus does the 
peaceful majority of our Turkish fellow citizens no favor. 
  We all want Germany to remain a foreigner-friendly country 
in 
the future. Our state based on the rule of law is obliged to 
protect the lives, the health, and the property of all the 
people living here. This applies to German citizens and to 
foreigners. This means our police officers have to provide a 
particularly difficult and frequently dangerous service. They 
must be aware that the large majority of the German population 
and the German Government support them in this service. I want 
to use this opportunity today to thank the police officers for 
the service they have provided. 
  I would now like to make a few remarks regarding the 
progress 
of the accession talks in the European Union. I regret that the 
European Union was yesterday unable to complete its accession 
negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. The 
foreign ministers will continue their talks next weekend. We 
Germans want to contribute everything we can to ensure that an 
acceptable conclusion is finally reached. This means that all 
those involved must demonstrate the will necessary to reach 
agreement. 
  During recent weeks we have been pressing for the northern 
expansion to include Norway, Finland, and Sweden -- just as was 
the case during the southern expansion when Spain and Portugal 
joined. It is entirely clear to us that the Scandinavian 
countries and Austria are just as much a part of Europe as the 
southern European states. It is already apparent that enormous 
progress has been made with regard to European integration 
during the last two years. 
  Within a short period of time, we have made substantial 
progress in terms of deepening and expanding the European Union 
through the Maastricht Treaty as well as the accession talks. 
This is in line with our basic goals and our interests -- not 
least in terms of European policy. This is the only way -- at 
least as far I am concerned -- that we will be able to ensure 
peace and freedom for our country and the continent as a whole 
in the future. There is no way we will be able to achieve this 
objective in the long-term through a superior form of free trade 
area. I want to say now that I will be advising you of our 
plans in good time and that the German presidency during the 
second half of the year will do everything it can to serve the 
objective I have mentioned. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, may I also say a few words about an 
issue that has concerned the German public and primarily also 
the French public over the last few weeks: The issue of my 
attendance or nonattendance at the celebrations marking the 50th 
anniversary of the landing of the Allies in Normandy. I would 
like to say one thing: I do not understand this discussion at 
all. At no time have I sought an invitation from any source or 
received such an invitation. I have at all times made it clear 
that, for myself, I would not accept such an invitation if it 
were to come. All reports to the contrary are pure invention. 
What surprises me somewhat is that -- just like 10 years ago in 
1984 -- such a discussion is being held again. There is no 
difference of opinion at all with the French Government and the 
French president over this matter. On Sunday [20 March], 
Francois Mitterrand made this clear in an interview with the AFP 
news agency, and I adhere to the view that German attendance at 
these celebrations is not appropriate. 
  I have in the meantime held intensive discussions with 
Mitterrand during our regular telephone calls on what we can do 
to stress again the close French-German friendship that has 
grown over the decades. We came to the conclusion that we would 
invite representatives of the younger generation -- youth 
groups, school classes, students -- to a festival of youth for 
French and German young people -- and also for young people from 
other countries -- in Heidelberg on 8 June to document once 
again our great friendship with a view to the future and not to 
the past, and also to celebrate our joint commitment to Europe. 
I am very grateful to State President Francois Mitterrand that 
he, for his part, emphasized this special gesture of solidarity. 
  In Heidelberg, we want, in particular, to express our joy at 
having succeeded over many years -- and I am also saying this on 
behalf of all other federal governments and all my predecessors 
-- in permanently establishing French-German friendship, without 
denying the experiences of history. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, on 31 August, after 50 years, the last 
Russian soldiers will leave German soil. That is 50 years after 
the first Soviet soldier walked on the territory of the German 
Reich. In September we will say farewell to our American, 
British, and French allies in Berlin. This is for us Germans, 
and, of course, for the Berliners especially, a particularly 
moving event. If we cast our minds back to 1948 for a moment 
everyone will understand that. The war ended three years before, 
and in a moment of serious danger the victors became our 
protectors, who courageously and successfully defended the 
freedom of West Berlin. The airlift was stronger than Stalin's 
attempts to cut the city off. When we look back to the years 
1959 and 1960, we also remember what our French, British, and 
American friends did for the German capital when Khrushchev made 
his ultimatum. 
  I have invited the American President, the British prime 
minister, and the French president to Berlin on 8 September for 
the formal leave-taking of the forces of the three powers in 
Berlin. Main points on the program will include a memorial 
ceremony for the Allied soldiers who died in the airlift for the 
freedom of Berlin, a ceremony in the Schauspielhaus [theater] 
with speeches by our guests, and at the end of the celebrations 
a great tattoo by the Bundeswehr in honor of our American, 
French, and British guests and of the American, French, and 
British soldiers. This will probably take place at the 
Brandenburg Gate. 
  The whole program is structured so that the Berlin 
population 
has the opportunity, in numbers as large as possible, to take 
part in these commemorations. The remaining soldiers from the 
former Soviet Union will leave Germany on 31 August to return to 
their home country. The return of the Russian troops to their 
homeland ends what was, up until the fall of the Wall, a painful 
chapter in the history of our two countries, and also Europe. 
Now we want to look to the future together and do everything to 
increase the depth of the good and friendly relations between 
Germany and Russia. My own personal wish is that the Russian 
soldiers return home with the feeling that they are now leaving 
a country of friends and partners. 
  I have invited President Yeltsin to come to Germany twice 
this year, first for an official visit in May -- the period from 
11-13 May has been agreed for this -- then for one day on 31 
August to attend the ceremony marking the departure of the 
Russian troops. The ceremony will take place in Weimar and 
Berlin. [passage omitted] The commemorations will then be 
continued throughout the day in Berlin with a wreath-laying 
ceremony at the memorial in Treptow involving Russian and German 
military guards of honor. Both President Yeltsin and I will 
address the Russian soldiers at this ceremony.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bruno Visentini, former Italian Republican </F>
Party leader, by Massimo Riva; place and date not given: 
"Visentini's Recipe for Resolving Crisis"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Riva] Are you standing 
chiefly as a [progressive] candidate against something? 
  [Visentini] No. It is against the threat of the Right, but 
first and foremost in favor of the possibility that 
civilized--bourgeois, if you like--culture can make its 
essential contribution to this country's emancipation... 
  [Riva] Actually, both [Forza Italia leader Silvio] 
Berlusconi 
and [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi now portray 
themselves as the champions of liberal-democratic culture. 
  [Visentini] The vision of politics that they display 
conflicts with all the teachings of liberal and democratic 
culture. Do you remember what [German philosopher] Max Weber 
wrote? According to his vision, the politician must base his 
actions on two kinds of ethics--of conviction and 
responsibility. In other words, he must always be able to 
adjust his means to the end. Consider the spectacle provided by 
the acrobats of the so-called pole of freedoms: They promise 
the moon -- a million new jobs, tax cuts, increased pensions, 
prosperity for all -- but without explaining how and by what 
means. They have reduced the election campaign to something 
like a circus or a Brazilian soap opera. It is a distressing 
and frightening spectacle that degrades politics and insults 
Italian society. 
  [Riva] So let us come to the constructive part of your 
candidacy: In whom and in what should Italian society believe? 
  [Visentini] First, it must start by squarely confronting the 
real nature of its problems and realize that it is a sick 
society, because the high level of unemployment we have now is 
the symptom of a serious illness that could undermine the bases 
of civilized coexistence. 
  [Riva] But this phenomenon is not confined to Italy. 
Unfortunately, unemployment is a major problem in the rest of 
Europe, too. 
  [Visentini] Yes, but elsewhere they are trying to approach 
the problem in earnest. In our country we are witnessing a very 
paradoxical process: While the Left has ceased to regard 
unemployment as the effect of a historical crisis of the 
capitalist system, the Right speaks and acts as though it is 
capitalism that is to blame and is not suggesting suitable 
treatments but confining itself to demanding more power in order 
to defend itself... 
  [Riva] But if the blame does not lie with the capitalist 
system, whose fault is it? 
  [Visentini] It is rather like it was in the twenties. At 
that time the recession and unemployment were the result of 
excesses in the deflationary policy. Do you remember Keynes' 
The Economic Results of Sir Winston Churchill? 
Something similar could be written now in connection with 
certain restrictive strategies pursued by some Western 
governments in the past decade. In Italy the crisis stems -- as 
well as from other factors such as the backwardness of our 
public structures, the weakness of our industrial and financial 
system, and certain social rigidities -- also from the state's 
excessive and disproportionate debt and from the constant 
stopgap measures every six months which have acted as a curb, 
instead of a comprehensive reform to open the way to development. 
  [Riva] If I understand you correctly, the solution is a 
rather more expansive economic policy. 
  [Visentini] Precisely. 
  [Riva] But this is what the Right says -- Berlusconi, for 
instance. 
  [Visentini] Oh, no, there is a big difference. They are 
promising to eliminate public intervention in the economy, 
whereas what I am saying is that the targets of this 
intervention must change. For instance, they are proposing a 
single income tax rate, which would ultimately give more to the 
rich and take more from the poor. I believe, on the contrary, 
that the path to economic growth must be taken above all in 
order to improve the situation of those with the lowest wages. 
The development and expansion of our economy and our GDP must 
not favor the most prosperous sectors but must create or 
increase the incomes of the sectors currently excluded or barely 
subsisting. This necessity was stated in a very perceptive 
article in THE WASHINGTON POST a few days ago. 
  [Riva] So are you more sensitive to the factor of social 
equity? 
  [Visentini] It is less a matter of equity and more a matter 
of considerations intrinsic to economic development. Old Ford 
understood that the expansion of his business depended not so 
much on purchases by wealthy people as on the opportunity for 
his own workers to buy the cars that they produced. This rule 
is all the more applicable today. By helping those earning the 
lowest incomes, who are most numerous in society, you create a 
new demand that can set in motion a circle between production 
and employment, thus also reducing overall savings, which are 
now invested idly in government stock. 
  [Riva] I understand that, but would a rather more expansive 
policy not have major repercussions on inflation and public 
finances, which are already in a precarious state? 
  [Visentini] Assuming that inflation at acceptable levels is 
always better than recession, I would like to make it clear that 
the public finance situation would derive substantial advantages 
from a growth directed toward improving the situation of those 
earning the lowest wages. Let us consider health, for instance. 
As long as there are a lot of poor people, public finances will 
be burdened by expenditure on health care. By the same token, 
if the proportion of prosperous people is increased, so too will 
the number of those able to provide for themselves without 
burdening the state. 
  [Riva] Professor, I feel like I am talking to a combination 
of Keynes and Robin Hood. 
  [Visentini] This is no joking matter. In fact it is a matter 
of pursuing social equity as a means of achieving economic 
recovery and the recovery of the public finance situation. This 
country's troubles stem from the excessive rigidity of the 
social scale. The concentration of wealth produces neither 
growth nor development, and in fact weakens the very cohesion of 
the system. If we want to avert even worse troubles, we must 
increase social mobility, that is, make society as a whole more 
efficient. 
  [Riva] Now perhaps I begin to understand why part of the 
middle class felt rather afraid when they heard you were 
standing as a candidate of the Left: You are outlining a 
political plan that challenges many social privileges and 
established positions. 
  [Visentini] The nice thing about capitalism, Galbraith once 
wrote, is that in its evolution something always happens whereby 
fools and their money are always separated. This is a rather 
paradoxical joke, but it does make one essential point. In 
Italy Galbraith's law has prevailed too infrequently. 
Therefore, we live in a paralyzed society that has absorbed the 
lack of mobility between classes and placed the burden on the 
state budget. This is the exact opposite of what is required to 
ensure the vitality of a capitalist system. Therefore, it is 
crazy -- as well as anticapitalist -- to believe that it is 
possible to resolve this impasse by stubbornly defending 
established positions. This path leads only to economic 
disaster, uncontrollable social tensions, and a real crisis of 
the capitalist system. 
  [Riva] When Roosevelt became U.S. President, his adversaries 
called him "that Bolshevik at the White House." If the Left is 
victorious, is that what they will say about Bruno Visentini? 
  [Visentini] I do not know, and I do not much care. But I 
would like to remind reluctant and hesitant members of the 
bourgeoisie that "that Bolshevik" revived American society, 
boosted its economy, consolidated democracy, and salvaged 
capitalism.

<F P=106> [Report by Foivos Karzis] </F>
  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's decision 
to suggest to the Security Council the dispatch of Turkish blue 
helmets to Bosnia has caused an immediate and strong reaction 
from Athens. Categorical opposition was expressed in a letter 
that Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias addressed urgently a 
short time ago to Security Council President French delegate 
Jean-Bernard Merimee. 
  The letter points out the need for the United Nations to 
observe the principle that rules out the participation in peace 
forces of bordering states or countries that have historic links 
to any of the parties involved in a conflict. 
  Mr. Papoulias is now chairing a conference being attended by 
top officials of the Foreign Ministry. 
  Earlier, UN spokesman Joe Sills said that Butrus-Ghali had 
decided to suggest to the Security Council that Turkey be added 
to the list of states that are authorized to contribute men to 
the UN peace force in the former Yugoslavia. The spokesman also 
noted that Butrus-Ghali decided to suggest the relaxation of the 
criteria prohibiting certain states from participating in the 
peace forces by invoking the recent developments in Bosnia and 
the need not to lose the current international momentum because 
the UN cannot muster enough forces. Mr. Sills avoided giving a 
direct answer on why Butrus-Ghali suggested the dispatch of blue 
helmets only from Turkey and not from other countries that have 
also offered, such as Italy and Greece. However, he did not 
rule out the possibility that there might be a similar 
suggestion in the immediate future. 
  Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator on the former 
Yugoslavia, confirmed that Mr. Merimee and representatives of 
other Security Council permanent members are maintaining a 
positive stance on the possibility of dispatching Turkish blue 
helmets. According to ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reports, UN circles 
believe that it is possible that approval will come in the next 
few days for the dispatch of 1,000 Turkish troops who, it is 
assumed, will be deployed primarily in the Croatian areas of 
Bosnia and certainly away from areas controlled by the Serbs.

<F P=106> [Recorded statement by Ambassador Inal Batu, permanent </F>
representative to the United Nations] 
  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today 
finally reached the decision we have been waiting for. He has 
decided to recommend to the UN Security Council that it approve 
Turkey's proposal to send troops to UNPROFOR, [UN Protection 
Forces] the peace force in former Yugoslavia. 
  Naturally, this is a satisfactory development for us. We 
have always claimed the following: UN officials themselves have 
been stating that there is a shortage of troops in that region. 
We, in turn, have proposed sending a force with the aim of 
contributing to peace. Our proposal is now deemed appropriate. 
We believe that the UN Security Council endorsement of the UN 
secretary general's recommendation is a mere formality. We do 
not foresee any difficulties in this regard. 
  This is not the first time Turkey has participated in UN 
peace forces. The Turkish Armed Forces have served with 
disciple, self-sacrifice, and honor in all previous UN 
operations. Those who doubt that the same sense of 
responsibility will prevail in former Yugoslavia as well are 
mistaken and prejudiced.
