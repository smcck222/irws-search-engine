<F P=106> ["rmc"-signed report: "Test Pilot Weger Made History With </F>
Eurofighter"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Probably on 19 or 20 April, Dasa wants to 
present the European combat fighter EF-2000 to the public in 
Manching near Ingolstadt. Last Sunday [27 March], the first 
prototype, DA-1, undertook a successful 70-minute maiden flight, 
starting from Dasa's own airfield. 
  Dasa's chief test pilot, Peter Weger (51), gave an account 
of 
his flight in DA-1: "Extremely easy to fly, just as on the 
simulator, much more stable than the Tornado." During the first 
flight in what is currently the most modern combat aircraft in 
the world, Weger already felt secure enough to extend and bring 
back in the landing gear and to simulate a landing approach. 
  It was only after the first flight of DA-1 that Weger 
realized he had made history: He is the first German to make a 
maiden flight in a multinational military aircraft destined for 
serial production after World War II. In the case of the 
"Tornado," more than 20 years ago, the pilot was British. 
  At the "official" first flight of EF-2000 in Ingolstadt, 
State Secretary Joerg Schoenbohm, in charge of armament in the 
Defense Ministry, will stand in for Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe. Ruehe will not attend the official first flight of the 
four nations (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain) in Warton, 
England, on 4 May, either. When Ruehe became defense minister 
some two years ago, he initially held the view that a new combat 
aircraft was not necessary. Later, he changed his view, saying 
"a new aircraft for a new time." 
  Yesterday [28 March], industry referred to this rather 
skeptical view held by the German defense minister and to the 
clear rejection of the Eurofighter by the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] (defense expert Kolbow: An SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] government will not buy the 
aircraft), adding: "We Germans still have great problems being 
accepted as partners by the others." 
  The current situation is such that the DA-1 prototype will 
only be tested in the air for 10 hours by Dasa in Ingolstadt; 
after that, it will be transferred to England. Great Britain 
has secured "the entire flight test program." This is a heavy 
setback for Germany as a business location, an industrial expert 
said. After the successful first flight, Dasa is "therefore, 
beginning to rethink." It insists on the number of test flights 
being increased.

  [Text] Erlangen, Germany, March 29 (AFP) -- German 
industrial group Siemens has set up a joint venture with Chinese 
firm Machine Tool Electric Appliance Factory (SMTEAF) in Suzhou, 
eastern China, the German group announced on Tuesday. 
  It said the joint venture, to employ 1,400 people in an 
initial phase, would make low-voltage electricity distribution 
equipment. Investments will amount to 100 million marks over 
five years, the announcement said. 
  Siemens will hold a majority stake in the company, to be

initialled a maritime traffic agreement. It is the first 
agreement of this kind between Romania and a West European state 
following the political changes in the country, the Federal 
Transport Ministry announced in Bonn today. The agreement was 
expected to provide an impetus for bilateral cooperation both 
commercially and at administrative level. It would regulate, 
among other things, the equal treatment of ships relating to 
their access to each other's ports, as well as port services, 
the recognition of seamen's travel documents and provisions in 
case of emergency.

<F P=106> [Peter Kirnich report: "The Leuna Deal Is Completed"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- The construction of the refinery in Leuna 
is secured. The French energy corporation Elf Aquitaine and the 
Trust Agency agreed on a compromise on Friday [25 March]. Buna 
GmbH, which is owned by the Trust Agency, is to take over the 
shares held by Thyssen Tradition Union in 1997 and, in return, 
will receive up to 33 percent of the Minol shares from Elf. 
  Elf Aquitaine has achieved its goal: The current majority 
shareholder in the 4-billion-mark [DM] project in Leuna has been 
able to reduce its shares from 67 to 43 percent. The Russian 
company Rosneft will take over the relevant 24 percent in the 
planned construction of a large refinery in Leuna. 
<H5>  Minol Shares Thrown In </H5>
  If Thyssen Trading Union -- which holds 33.3 percent in the 
consortium -- leaves the project after the completion of the 
refinery, Buna GmbH will take over its shares. In return, Buna 
is to "get up to 33 percent of the Minol gasoline station 
network from Elf," Trust Agency Wolf Schoede announced on Friday. 
<H5>  Prospects for Buna </H5>
  Thus, the path has been paved for the construction of the 
large refinery. However, according to Schoede, the board of 
governors of Elf Aquitaine still has to take a vote on the 
result in Paris on Monday [28 March]. If the body were to 
oppose the compromise, against all expectations, the Trust 
Agency will demand -- as has been agreed by contract -- the 
return of the Minol gasoline station network and, at the same 
time, call for a contractual penalty of DM1.5 billion. 
  The new refinery, with an annual capacity of about 8 million 
tonnes, is a decisive pillar for the preservation of large 
chemical industries in the central German triangle. Above all, 
for Buna GmbH "the privatization prospects have improved 
further, since Buna will get an attractive share in Minol," as 
Schoede said. In addition, Buna, which is the largest buyer of 
refinery products in the region, can build raw material 
deliveries on a secure basis. 
  On Wednesday [23 March] Trust Agency President Birgit Breuel 
signed a declaration of intent with representatives of Thyssen 
and the Russian Gazprom AG, according to which the two take over 
the management of the polyolefine chemical industry in Buna and 
Boehlen for five to seven years. According to the Trust Agency 
concept, in the future Buna is to be supplied directly with 
natural gas from the Siberian field of Yamal. The natural gas 
is to be transported with tanker ships from Arkhangelsk to 
Rostock and then be provided to Buna through a pipeline from the 
Baltic Sea coast, which is still to be built. 
<H5>  Land Provides Financial Aid </H5>
  The Thyssen Tradition Union welcomes the compromise. A 
Thyssen spokesman said that if construction begins after Easter, 
the refinery will be completed on time at the end of 1996 or the 
beginning of 1997. 
  FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that Elf 
Aquitaine is "now all the more obligated to act." Saxony-Anhalt 
Economics Minister Rainer Lukowitz announced that the project 
will be supported with approximately DM1 billion from the land 
and the Federal Government.

  [Text] On behalf of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], 
I want to tell the German public and the German people the 
following: We are not at all interested in creating problems in 
Germany, that is, to disturb the Germans, establish street 
barricades, or create unrest. I think that there would have 
been no riots if the police had not provoked the masses. 
  Let me now come to the question of whether the PKK organized 
these actions. The PKK did not plan these actions, but the PKK 
supports the people's actions, which were right. 
  I want to say the following about our relations with 
Germany. 
We also have a relevant message, that is, an instruction from 
our Secretary General 'Abdullah Ocalan. To eliminate all 
existing problems and prevent negative consequences, we are 
prepared to discuss the problems with the FRG Government. In 
concrete terms, we do not have any prejudice against the FRG 
Government. This is the first thing. Second, if the democratic 
rights that are due to the Kurdish people, for example, the 
right to demonstrate, the organization of cultural events, and 
the right of assembly, are not restricted in any way, we are in 
exchange prepared to eliminate existing problems, that is, 
actions regarded as disturbing here in Germany, in a joint 
action through consultations with the FRG Government. 
  Finally, I want to say that the PKK has absolute authority 
over the Kurdish people and, also that the people are backing 
its leadership.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kurdish extremists who "abuse the right 
to hospitality and commit serious crimes" on German soil can de 
deported to Turkey without a bad conscience. He assumes that 
the deported criminals would not be tortured or killed in their 
homeland, Kinkel said after an FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
Presidium session in Berlin today. 
  In Germany consideration is currently being given to an 
agreement with Turkey on the deportation of Kurdish extremists. 
No decision has however yet been made. The Turkish Government 
has already given an assurance that German weapons would not be 
used in internal disputes with the Kurds and its party, the PKK. 
Since he became foreign minister there has only been "five or 
six cases" where the German Government has had doubts about the 
implementation of that agreement, Kinkel said.

situation remains highly explosive. [passage omitted] 
  What do our politicians have to say? 
  SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] leader Rudolf 
Scharping told BILD: "The law must be rigorously applied 
against people who commit acts of violence and go on the rampage 
in our country." 
  Speaking to BILD, Baden-Wuerttemberg Minister-President 
Erwin 
Teufel called for more police to be deployed against terror in 
the streets: "People who are eligible for military service 
should be able to serve in the police force as volunteers for a 
period of 10 years instead of joining fire brigades or disaster 
relief organizations." They should help the police in the case 
of demonstrations, large-scale operations, or assist with office 
work. 
  Teufel also does not exclude the possibility of deploying 
the 
Bundeswehr within Germany. "Before I would let the state go to 
the dogs, I would support using the Bundeswehr as a kind of 
National Guard within the country, but only with the approval of 
majority that can alter the constitution."

<F P=106> [Kurt Stenger commentary: "Hypocritical"] </F>
  [Text] The hysteria in Bonn because of the "abuse of 
hospitality" by Kurds, who blocked the highways, is 
hypocritical. Has anyone ever been that angry about the war of 
the Turkish Army -- and here one must really speak of a war -- 
against the Kurdish people, which also affects relatives of our 
"guests"? 
  Of course not, because today Bonn is the most important ally 
of Ankara, where one likes to speak of the (not only) historic 
"German-Turkish comradeship-in-arms." Without the gifts of 
weapons from the West, the war would long have become too 
expensive for Turkey. 
  Even more important is the political support, which Bonn 
gives the NATO state. The banning of Kurdish associations in 
1993 was seen in Ankara as the "go-ahead" for a new military 
offensive. And not only that: Democratic rules are not even 
observed for the sake of appearances anymore. Bothersome 
newspapers are banned, elected deputies of the "Democracy party" 
-- the only force that could mediate between Ankara and the 
Kurds -- are arrested straight out of parliament. 
  Turkey is a military dictatorship, which keeps a civilian 
government for representation toward the outside world. The 
human rights violations -- 900 devastated villages, hundreds of 
thousands of refugees, murders by death squadrons -- are 
documented. Even though Bonn broaches the subjects during 
official visits to keep the public in Germany quiet, that is 
all. However, only pressure from abroad could bring about a 
political solution to the conflict. 
  In particular, Germany, with its considerable possibilities 
for exerting influence on the government in Ankara, would be 
predestined for that. However, Kohl, Kanther, and Kinkel are 
obviously not even remotely thinking of that. They continue to 
rely on confrontation with the Kurds in Germany.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer </F>
by Klaus-Peter Klingelschmidt and Mathhias Gels, place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Fischer, the coalition Greens 
gained votes in the elections in Lower Saxony, yet despite that 
they will not be able to govern any longer. What do the results 
mean for your option of a red-green coalition at the national 
level? 
  [Fischer] The election results in Lower Saxony mean a very 
good outcome for Bonn because it takes away the fears of an SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany]-Green alliance and at the 
same time demonstrates that the Greens are continuing to 
consolidate their base. For the coalition Greens in Lower Saxony 
it is bitter to have won and nonetheless not be able to 
participate in governing any longer. To be sure, the question 
remains unanswered as to how long the SPD's one-vote majority 
will really continue to hold. The Greens in Hannover are a 
governing party in waiting. The results are generating 
incredible motivation nationwide and that seems to me to be the 
decisive aspect. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Was it the Mannheim party convention that 
made 
possible this enormous thrust on the part of the coalition 
Greens? 
  [Fischer] If I were to be ironic in my answer now, I would 
say "Yes." 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] To ask in all seriousness: Did the Mannheim 
resolutions and the harsh public reaction to the party 
convention play a negative role in the outcome of the Lower 
Saxony elections? 
  [Fischer] The Mannheim resolutions, taken as a whole, show 
that the party has taken a gigantic step forward. I would have 
liked the rhetoric to have been less agitated--then the signals 
sent out from Mannheim would have looked better. But that is old 
hat. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] It is understandable that you now interpret 
the Lower Saxony election results as a fine success for the 
party as well as for the red-green project, but making the 
appropriate projections for the Bundestag elections, the 
increase would mean that the Greens would jump from 4.8 percent 
to 6.6 percent. Yet that certainly is not the magnitude of 
importance that the Greens want to achieve in the fall of 1994 
in order to convince Rudolf Scharping that he cannot avoid an 
red-green coalition, is it? 
  [Fischer] I am not among those who believe that whoever is 
the winner in the opinion polls will be also be the winner in 
the elections. The French Greens certainly taught us that 
lesson: They traded at 20 percent and wound up at 7 percent. 
Everything over 5 percent is good; everything over 7 percent is 
very good; and everything over 10 percent would be sensational. 
That is my hierarchy. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] What results do the Greens need, in your 
opinion, for there to be at least a chance of a coalition with 
the SPD at the national level? 
  [Fischer] The Greens must first of all come in from the 
cold. 
I never tire of stressing that so arrogance and carelessness do 
not take hold. If things go too well for the Green donkey, it 
likes to dance on thin ice, and distress is then very great when 
it falls through. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Can an SPD-Green alliance be created at all 
with Rudolf Scharping? He had the choice in Rheinland-Pfalz and 
decided in favor of the liberals. 
  [Fischer] Whether it is possible will depend upon the 
participation of the Greens, the content of their programs, and 
their people. One thing is certain for me: no coalition at any 
price. If we cannot see Green policies reflected in a coalition, 
I will advocate remaining in the opposition. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] In May of last year on this same point you 
informed us that the Greens would probably not be ready to 
assume governmental responsibility at the national level in 
1994--that they were still too much of a protest party. 
  [Fischer] For me the same principle continues to apply: I 
would reject any coalition agreement that I was convinced could 
not be lived up to. The Federal Republic is not something to 
play games with. If we want to govern, it means that we must 
strive for a successful coalition. If you do not think you are 
capable of that, then you should leave it alone. It would be 
worse than a disappointment if, after a year and a half, the 
sole approach to reform on the democratic left were to be over 
and done with for a long time to come. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Scharping is conducting an election campaign 
with emphasis on classic SPD priorities; there are hardly any 
issues in common with Green policies. Is that something more 
than campaign tactics--that is, is it already a decision in 
advance against an SPD-Green coalition? 
  [Fischer] If an SPD-Green alliance wants to achieve a 
majority, the party of the people has to wage the battle for the 
center and win it. During the last Bundestag campaign there was 
obvious SPD-Green competition between the SPD and the Greens. 
That proved to be unsuccessful for both sides. Nonetheless, I am 
not advocating that the SPD pack in its red-green interests and 
in the final analysis we negotiate with a modernized Hermann 
Rappe by the name of Gerhard Schroeder. One thing, to be sure, 
is clear: There will not be a national government with our 
participation without vigorous ecological reform. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Hence, an election campaign as a kind of 
division of labor without truly evident programmatic common 
interests and a coalition after the election. That sounds rather 
artificial. 
  [Fischer] He who wants a red-green coalition must vote for 
the Greens, and he who wants a reform Kohl will vote for the 
SPD--and together we will form a true ecosocial reform coalition. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Whether society is imaginative enough to be 
able to conceive of that and is eager enough to experiment... 
  [Fischer] ...If this crisis does not invite experimentation, 
it will not be overcome. Now is the hour of experiments! And 
that is why I am no longer as pessimistic as I was maybe just a 
year ago. Society is beginning to move in the direction of 
fundamental change and basic policy changes--the reduction in 
working hours, for example, proves this. The contention that 
there is no climate of reform or "no experiments wanted" is no 
longer valid. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Let us assume that the climate is really 
better than its reputation, that the numbers are sufficient, and 
that the SPD is willing to go along with the Greens... 
  [Fischer] ...Just the opposite--the Greens are prepared to 
go 
along with the SPD. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Fine. What will the new social contract look 
like that you are talking about? 
  [Fischer] We will have to stop dumping the burdens of 
unification primarily on the working classes. We need a new 
distribution of burdens. The question will arise as to what 
extent those who earn more will be willing to assume a greater 
share of the burden for the restructuring of our welfare 
state--whether they will be willing to bear, step by step, 
greater burdens for ecological restructuring, for investments in 
education, for German unification, and for basic security. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] That is still just a description of the 
problem rather than a solution. Thus far, it does not look as if 
the renunciation of material benefits for the sake of 
unification or of the environment can really be successfully 
appealed to. 
  [Fischer] That is a matter of political conviction and also 
one of mobilizing interests. The workers are faced with the 
brutal issue of solidarity between those who have work and those 
who do not and therefore the propertied classes must also ask 
themselves whether they will increase their investments in 
Germany's future. In this case I am for undogmatic 
deliberations. Why should we not introduce municipal bonds? Why 
should not the citizens of Frankfurt be able to purchase 
city-owned enterprises? But we will also have to ask whether a 
landtag member or an editor-in-chief should have everything for 
free. The question of solidarity is to be formulated in a very 
tangible manner here. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Will that not scare off the Greens' classic 
middle-class constituents? 
  [Fischer] I like to be a Utopian in this case. If such 
deliberations scare off the middle class, then things will 
continue to go downhill until the point is reached where even 
the middle class will realize that things cannot continue in 
this manner. I am not advocating the expropriation of the middle 
class. At issue here is the realization of one's own 
self-interest that cannot be defined in a narrow-minded, 
material sense. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] A future national government will hardly be 
able to do without tax increases. Will the Greens say in advance 
how much more and for what the citizens will have to pay? 
  [Fischer] The issue here is not a policy of tax increases 
but 
rather an overhaul of the tax system. If we introduce ecotaxes, 
we will have to back off on taxes pegged to incomes. If I demand 
somewhat more from people in the way of taxes on petroleum, then 
there must be tangible improvements in local public 
transportation. Too, the creative phase for both parties will 
not really get under way until the coalition negotiations--not 
in party conventions held to develop platforms. Then things will 
really get exciting. When it comes down to fundamental change, 
when various elements of society with their ideas and demands 
crowd their way into such negotiations as well, when a true 
restructuring of policies is at stake, I think that the SPD 
too--even Mr. Scharping--will get a kick out of it. Desire for 
reform, frustration with stagnation, experiments at last: That 
is the motto. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] What are the core issues of emphasis for a 
red-green government program? 
  [Fischer] We need a structural revolution in energy, 
transportation, and waste management policy. The second area 
will be a restructuring of the welfare state, the attempt to 
stop social disintegration. The third project will be German 
unity. Fourth: The Europeanizing of our society, the right of 
immigration, and dual citizenship. And finally, we will deal 
with a new definition of foreign policy while at the same time 
retaining the tradition of the Federal Republic as a nation of 
peace--that is, where is this Germany headed? Will we remain 
oriented towards Europe or are we again going to chase old 
illusions of power? Will Germany become a factor for stability 
or a risk factor? Those are the fundamental questions for future 
foreign policy. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Will you answer these questions on the basis 
of the Mannhein resolutions on foreign policy? How much popular 
support do the Greens expect for their demand for a gradual 
abandonment of the Bundeswehr and the dissolution of NATO? 
  [Fischer] No one among us wants to dissolve NATO 
immediately. 
The question arises: How should a pan-European peace order look? 
And this order will transcend NATO. The Greens' program 
contains, by the way, a clear "Yes" to European 
integration--that is, the manifest incorporation of everything 
resolved in Mannheim as the Greens' vision into an overall 
European process--including the linkage of the disarming of the 
Bundeswehr to peace conditions in Europe that permit this. We 
are not advocating a new adventurism here. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Does what you are explaining here so nicely 
mean that our resolutions are one thing and real policy 
something else? 
  [Fischer] That would amount to opportunism. That may have 
been the case with one individual or another--the ringing party 
convention speeches simply sound different than internal 
statements. For the majority of the delegates and the party, 
however, that does not hold true. It is not a question of 
opportunism but a kind of ensuring one's own identity--precisely 
because in many other areas a far-reaching step has been taken 
in the direction of realpolitik. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] What, in the final analysis, will still 
remain 
of the party's foreign policy resolutions in a red-green 
coalition agreement? 
  [Fischer] We will have vigorous negotiations to conduct on 
the issues of the Bundeswehr's mission and the reduction of its 
troop strength; likewise on the issues of ending armaments 
exports and effective measures for conversion. We will make 
human rights a central criterion of foreign policy and we will 
have to negotiate on a new, solidarity-oriented definition of 
Germany's role in north-south issues. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] What, in your opinion, do the 
coalition-seeking Greens have to do this election year for a 
red-green coalition to come about? 
  [Fischer] We must struggle and forego everything that will 
result in dissention. If we were to succeed in formulating 20 
salient points from the Greens' perspective on the basis of our 
election platform and program of principles--and do so without 
dissention and in a manner that transcends factions--I would 
emphatically advocate that they be presented, debated, and 
adopted at a one-day extraordinary party convention. That would 
once again give a boost to our motivation. 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you want to do a little retroactive repair 
work on the current state of party resolutions? 
  [Fischer] No, make them more specific because our program of 
fundamental principles and our election platform are jumbled 
together in our Mannheim resolutions. What do we think we can 
really take on in four years? 
  [TAGESZEITUNG] Is not a red-green coalition in essence only 
a 
playfully meant option that is being debated because the 
conservative-liberal governing coalition has exhausted itself 
without a majority in society having committed to a fundamental 
change of policy? 
  [Fischer] No. A red-green coalition is the sole, seriously 
intended reform option. If the conservative-liberal government 
survives the elections, there will be no renewal--at most a 
restoration in the direction of a more German 
nationalist-oriented conservatism. A grand coalition means grand 
stagnation and a socialist-liberal coalition would result in a 
barely recognizable modicum of change with a Free Democratic 
Party (FDP) that is only in the government for its own sake. We 
are fighting to govern this country because we want to shape it. 
That is the old dream of 1968. In those days, we dreamt it in 
revolutionary terms, and today we dream it in terms of reform. 
  The historic mission of my party lies in ecological 
restructuring--where critical and basic policy guidelines have 
not yet been decided upon. And that is, after all, a great 
challenge in one of the most important industrial countries of 
the world. That will require all our strength.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Rolf </F>
Kleine; place and date not given: "Scharping: Unification 
Surcharge Until All Debts Are Settled"] 
  [Text] [Kleine] In the event of an election victory of 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], the party wants to 
increase the unification surcharge for "high-income earners" to 
10 percent. Do you want to enter the election campaign as the 
party that advocates tax increases? 
  [Scharping] We are paying too many taxes and fees. For this 
reason, I want to reduce the burden for 80 percent of taxpayers. 
Thus, Kohl wants to raise taxes for everybody, but I only for 
the top earners. 
  [Kleine] You want to introduce a 10-percent unification 
surcharge for single people who earn 60,000 German marks [DM] or 
more per year and for married couples who earn DM120,000 or more 
per year. Over what period of time are you thinking? 
  [Scharping] Until all the inherited burdens from the shadow 
budgets of the current Federal Government are removed. 
  [Kleine] Your traffic expert Christoph Zoepel has suggested 
increasing the gasoline price by 20 pfennigs per liter... 
  [Scharping] The SPD election program will not include an 
increase in the gasoline tax. Waigel wants to do that. His 
financial planning for 1996 provides for this measure. 
  The politicians in Bonn are preparing for the next tax lie. 
The SPD wants jobs and justice. The whole debate must be seen 
in this context. 
  [Kleine] You are commuting between Mainz and Bonn every day, 
and you work late into the night. Is the stress ruining you? 
  [Scharping] My normal working week has 100 hours, sometimes 
more. There are many things that I have to settle personally. 
I do not and will not have an automatic signing machine. One 
can only do this job if one enjoys doing it and does not see it 
as a burden. 
  [Kleine] The young socialists in southern Hesse want to 
poison a small dog in protest against the deportation of Kurds... 
  [Scharping] This is the absolute ultimate in tastelessness.

<F P=106> [Report by Frank Bretschneider, ADN: "Programs for Soldiers </F>
Without a Job"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  North Rhine-Westphalia </H5>
  The Cold War is over and the Iron Curtain between the former 
power blocs in the East and the West has fallen. Even though 
the world has not become more peaceful as a result, as the 
conflicts in Bosnia or Korea show, the time of the arms race at 
least seems to be over. According to a study by the European 
Union [EU], by the year 2000 the arms industry will shrink 
world-wide by about 30 percent. What, however, is to happen to 
the soldiers, the nuclear scientists, and weapons that are no 
longer needed? 
  This is a problem that will be dealt with by the world's 
first Center for Arms Conversion (BICC), which will start work 
in Bonn in April. Arms conversion means the conversion of 
military facilities for civilian purposes -- a multifaceted 
issue: It includes the scrapping of weapons, the "retraining" 
of professional soldiers, the new orientation of the armament 
industry, as well as the use of the money saved from the defense 
budget. 
  The BICC, which was founded on the initiative of the North 
Rhine- Westphalian Land Government, wants to draw up concepts on 
these issues: "The work is practically waiting to be tackled," 
said Mr. Wulf, the designated head of the center, when he 
presented his future work in Duesseldorf. "We understand 
ourselves as a service station for practical peace work." 
  Arms expert Wulf, who has until now headed the Development 
and Peace Institute at Duisburg University and is an adviser to 
the UN Disarmament Department, begins his work with 10 
employees. Later on, the staff is to be increased to 30. North 
Rhine-Westphalia takes over the start-up financing -- 11.7 
million German marks [DM] over the next five years. Day-to-day 
operations are to be financed by the World Bank, the EU, or 
foundations. 
  The costs of disarmament are becoming a problem for many 
countries, Wulf warns. His example is Russia: There 4.5 
million people are employed in the arms industry. If these 
people cannot find any new work, this could lead to a "social 
disaster." In Germany about 280,000 jobs are dependent on arms 
production; in addition, there are soldiers and civilian 
employees in barracks. 
  "Of course, we can make only a moderate contribution to 
solving the problems," Wulf knows. For this purpose, the BICC 
wants, among other things, to advise arms companies and 
establish a database, where experiences and concepts are stored 
and passed on. So far, there are many individual projects all 
over the world, but they are not linked with one another. 
Specifically: One country is looking for solutions that may 
already have been found elsewhere. 
  While the new orientation of the employees in the arms 
industry and the military gives rise to many problems in view of 
the worldwide job crisis, arms conversion meanwhile is making 
the most progress in using outdated military facilities and in 
scrapping weapons. In the FRG, for instance, universities are 
taking over vacant barracks and using them as lecture halls or 
want to establish students' hostels there. And the dismantling 
of a tank, for instance, costs only DM3,000 now, Wulf says. 
Three years ago it cost DM30,000.

<F P=106> ["m." report: "Volkswagen Loses DM400 Million During First </F>
Quarter; No Capital Measures This Year"] 
  [Excerpt] Wolfsburg -- A loss of about 400 million German 
marks [DM] is emerging for the Volkswagen corporation during the 
first quarter of 1994. For the AG [shareholding company], on 
the other hand, the balance will probably be zero. Ferdinand 
Piech, chairman of the board of directors, said that the yield 
targets for the entire year will be balanced for the corporation 
(in 1993 it suffered a loss of DM1.94 billion), while the AG is 
to exceed last year's amount of DM71 million. During the first 
quarter, deliveries to customers all over the world expanded by 
4.7 percent to 838,000 units. While orders received rose by 
11.8 percent on the large European markets during the first 
quarter, in Germany they went up by 54 percent. Piech said that 
the price reductions of "DM1,000 to DM1,800" largely put an end 
to the wait-and-see attitude regarding orders and that 
Volkswagen is increasingly benefiting from its own development. 
  After the massive reduction of investments last year (DM4.8 
billion following DM9.3 billion the year before), this year a 
volume of DM5-9 billion is to be invested. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Daimler-Benz subsidiary German Aerospace (Dasa) 
is in a worse state than had been thought until now. Two years 
ago, in drawing up their medium-term financial plans, Dasa 
managers assumed that their German Airbus subsidiary would 
deliver about 215 aircraft a year. A year ago, they had to 
adjust their forecast to about 180 aircraft a year -- according 
to their latest internal calculations, Airbus can only sell 120 
aircraft this year and next year. As a result, almost 3,000 
jobs are to be shed by the end of next year. From 1996 onward, 
Dasa managers expect Airbus sales to improve: If their 
calculations are wrong once again, there is a danger that more 
jobs will be lost.

leading party from the local elections and the biggest credit 
goes to leader Tansu Ciller. The TPP Chairmanship Council met 
under Kiratlioglu in Ankara and appraised the election results. 
  In a statement before the meeting, Kiratlioglu said that the 
TPP is not considering early general elections. Pointing out 
that the TPP took over an economy ridden with crises, 
Kiratlioglu noted that the government will try to solve the 
economic problems by 1966. He also expressed the view that the 
coalition government will not experience any difficulties. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has called a meeting 
of the TPP assembly group tomorrow morning.

  [Text] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has 
declared that the results of the elections so far demonstrate 
that they lag behind his party's aim to become the first party, 
but they further intensify the political division in Turkey. 
Yilmaz announced that there will not be any quest for a new 
government and his party is definitely not a candidate for 
partnership in the government. Yilmaz reiterated his demand for 
early general elections. 
  Yilmaz held a news conference at the end of the ANAP 
Chairmanship Council meeting. He noted that according to the 
results of yesterday's elections, his party is the second 
biggest party. Yilmaz explained that before the elections he 
refrained from making statements with false claims and said that 
the party may not receive the expected results because the 
citizens are not fully aware of the economic problems. 
Political division causes concern at a time when the country 
most needs political stability, Yilmaz remarked. Given this 
situation, he said, the proposal to implement an election system 
with two rounds in smaller regions has become a necessity. 
  Yilmaz reiterated his demand to hold early general elections 
and added: 
  [Begin recording] In these general elections, parties will 
present themselves to the citizens not only with their polished 
candidates, but with solutions to the basic problems currently 
facing Turkey. We believe that Turkey needs such elections now. 
Such an election will not only urge the citizens to choose in 
connection with the local authorities, it will also display 
their will regarding solutions to the main problems of the 
country. I believe that if the necessary step is taken to hold 
early elections and change the election system, it will be 
possible to erase this excessively divided political picture. 
[end recording] 
  Replying to questions during his news conference, Yilmaz 
said 
that the government must now implement economic stability 
measures without any delay and the country must be led towards 
early general elections in a reasonable time. Asked to comment 
on Prime Minister Ciller's previous statement that his 
leadership will be disputed if the party fails in the elections, 
Yilmaz said that he does not take any note of this view. He 
pointed out: There is no need for Mrs. Ciller to make such an 
appeal. I would make this assessment myself. 
  Noting that he was elected ANAP leader through the will of 
the party's grassroots, Yilmaz said: If I believe that there is 
a person who will take the party further than myself, then I 
would make every possible sacrifice for my party. 
  He expressed the belief that the coalition government will 
remain in power, adding that under the circumstances there will 
not be any quest for a new government and his party is not a 
candidate for such a partnership.

  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, leader of the Social Democratic 
Populist Party [SDPP], state minister, and deputy prime 
minister, has declared that the election results indicate the 
emergence of a political formation towards rightist parties. 
  In reply to a reporter's question whether the coalition is 
in 
danger, after the SDPP Central Administrative Council meeting, 
Karayalcin retorted: The arithmetic of the results do not 
indicate this. 
  Karayalcin announced that his party's Central Administrative 
Council will convene again tomorrow and following the joint 
meeting of the SDPP Turkish Grand National Assembly group and 
ministers, the SDPP Party Council will also probably meet on the 
weekend. Karayalcin said: 
  [Begin recording] [Karayalcin] Undoubtedly, the Party 
Council will assess the matter in all its aspects. It will also 
appraise the achievements of the coalition government. All your 
questions will be answered after those deliberations. 
  As you know, we are also engaged in work on economic 
matters. 
Moreover, we have not yet received all the data that will allow 
us to make statistical evaluations. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will the government introduce a 
package of price increases? 
  [Karayalcin] Statements concerning this subject will be 
issued later; not by me, probably by the relevant minister. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What did you discuss during today's 
Central Administrative Council meeting? 
  [Karayalcin] We assessed the elections. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is the general trend? What are 
the assessments? 
  [Karayalcin] In actual fact, we have not yet received all 
the input to enable our colleagues to make detailed evaluations. 
Nevertheless, the members of the council observed that there is 
a general shift in political preference in Turkey. A political 
formation leaning towards rightist parties, especially extreme 
rightist parties, has emerged in recent elections. The 
indications were noticeable in previous elections as well. 
There were signs in 1993. In the 1994 local elections, this 
trend emerged very clearly. Given the impressions of party 
members and citizens, our council members expressed concern over 
the possibility that our citizens could change their preference 
for a Western-style democracy. [end recording] 
  Answering another question, Karayalcin remarked that his 
party and the leftists failed to receive the desired results in 
the elections and that the total votes decreased by 25 percent.

  [Excerpt] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan 
has declared that his party increased its share in the votes by 
100 percent in the 27 March local elections. Erbakan, in a news 
conference in Ankara today, said that according to results he 
received from his party's organization, PP is the winner of the 
elections. Under these circumstances, Erbakan noted, the 
parties that have shrunk should unite under the PP. 
  Charging that the votes of the coalition government dropped 
from 48 to 33 percent, Erbakan asked for early elections as soon 
as possible. He proposed a True Path Party [TPP]-Motherland 
Party [ANAP]-Social Democratic Populist Party tripartite 
coalition until the early elections on a trial basis. 
  According to information reaching him from provinces and 
districts, his party is leading both in the municipal council 
elections and the mayoral posts, Erbakan remarked, adding that 
from now on his party will mark 27 March as the holiday of local 
authorities. He said: 
  [Begin recording] The most important number showing the 
strength of the parties is the votes for the provincial 
councils. These results are not final yet. The work is still 
continuing. Looking at the data so far, we see that the PP is 
leading with a big majority in the big cities, in the towns, in 
districts, and in townships. As far as the total provincial 
council election results are concerned, the three parties -- PP, 
ANAP, and TPP -- are competing with one another. Any one of 
them is leading in accordance with the vote counts. We have not 
yet received the final results. [end recording] [passage

Party (DEP), which faces imminent closure by the Constitutional 
Court, started on Thursday [24 March] to debate the 
establishment of a new political party. Sources said the 
moderate Kurdistan Socialist Party (PSK) of Kemal Burkay and 
other peaceful movements which had joined the DEP in the past 
are considering setting up a separate party. 
  Party sources told the TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] on Thursday 
that the executive assembly had met in order to decide the fate 
of the DEP, which is expected to be closed down by the court at 
the end of April. The Constitutional Court, which was scheduled 
to decide on the closure next week, recently gave an additional 
five weeks to the party's attorneys to prepare their defense. 
  Referring to the imprisonment of five DEP deputies by the 
Ankara State Security Court, the party's acting chairman, Remzi 
Kartal, said on Thursday that this was an act "placing the 
Kurdish problem in prison." 
  He accused political leaders of adopting a negative attitude 
toward the DEP and said President Suleyman Demirel had given the 
signal "for the sentence to be passed." 
  The DEP was first established under the name of the Peoples' 
Labor Party (HEP) and after this was closed down by the 
Constitutional Court. It reopened as the Freedoms and Labor 
Party (OZDEP), which was also closed down. 
  In the new debate, party executives and the grassroots are 
discussing whether Turkey would tolerate the creation of a new 
party and how measures will be taken to protect party executives 
from being subject to political bans. If a decision to continue 
activities on the political platform is made, the DEP is 
expected to announce that it has "expelled" all of its 
provincial and district executives to avoid any legal action 
against them when the closure takes place. Deputies of the DEP 
who were members of the party when charges were filed against it 
will automatically lose their parliamentary status and face 
trial. 
  Sources told the TDN that there were some DEP members who 
were supporters of the Kurdistan Socialist Party (PSK) and who 
wanted to create their own political--and legal--party. 
Supporters of the Hevgirtin [Unity] group and the Rizgari 
[Liberation] movement also believe that they should reorganize 
outside the DEP, but complain that they do not have enough 
grassroots support to be able to do so. However, the general 
feeling within the party is that none of the groups are strong 
enough to stand on their own. During this meeting the party 
assembly is also expected to decide on the fate of executive 
assembly member Ali Baskoylu who recently made a public 
suggestion that all DEP officials should seek political asylum 
at foreign missions in their territory. Baskoylu had called on 
DEP executives to enter embassies and seek asylum there and 
claimed that there was "no need to use the political platform." 
  Observers say the expulsion of Baskoylu would imply that the 
DEP may decide to stay in the political arena despite the recent 
campaign of harassment it has faced.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Altan Oymen: "To Be `Relieved' by a Letter" </F>
-- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] Yes, Turkey's economy is shaky... As we pointed out 
yesterday, hope has been vested in the measures the Turkish 
Government has to take after 28 March, measures that the 
opposition parties should support... It is only then that we 
can feel relieved. 
  However, judging by the reports that were disseminated by 
government sources yesterday, we do not have to wait until then. 
A new development has taken place and we may begin to relax 
immediately. 
  What was that "development?" Clinton has reportedly sent a 
letter to Tansu Ciller. It was a lengthy letter, the text of 
which was leaked to one of the newspapers in one way or 
another... It contained several promises. It said: "(...) We 
eagerly expect to work with you and with your government in the 
next few days and weeks." 
  Well, there is nothing to worry about... The United States 
is supporting us... Our economic problems and other difficulties 
will be resolved... 
  Yes, that was the atmosphere that was created by the 
government circles and, of course, by the newspaper that 
published the letter. 
  Yes, that was the "atmosphere" that was created. However, 
not even children would believe that that "atmosphere" will 
improve the situation. A letter from the United States, 
greetings from Ronald Reagan, a telephone call from George Bush, 
and an encouraging gesture by Clinton... 
  Rejoicing and congratulating oneself over such developments 
is an ailment which has obsessed several of our leading 
politicians for many years. That approach has several 
drawbacks. It neither promotes their prestige nor adds to the 
dignity of their country. Usually, that approach ends in 
disappointment. The outcome of the hope we had to "put one in 
and take five out" during the Gulf crisis must be recalled at 
this point. The telephone calls we received [from the United 
States] inspired that hope in Turkey at the time. 
  Meanwhile, it must be pointed out that the greetings, 
telephone calls, and letters are not limited to compliments and 
promises. Requests are conveyed in them as well. Naturally, no 
head of state will agree to give something to his counterpart 
just because he finds his colleague's eyes and conversation 
sympathetic. State interests are the determining factor in the 
relations between statesmen or stateswomen. And, what is 
exchanged cannot be defined as giving or taking. The matter is 
known as a "give and take" process. 
  That matter becomes obvious when the translated version of 
Clinton's letter is read, regardless of the strange way it has 
been translated into Turkish. For example, the letter contained 
a promise for "technical aid" for the realization of Eximbank's 
credit of $5 billion for Turkey's imports... Yes, Clinton made 
that promise. However, he later said: "I hope that you will 
consider the possibility of easing the difficult conditions that 
prevent the Patriarchate from becoming a functional institution." 
  The letter also contained a promise for U.S. support for 
Turkey's effort to secure $2.7 billion from the World Bank in 
the form of a credit. However, that was followed by a request 
for Turkey to "work" more closely with Rauf Denktas on the 
Cyprus problem and for "consideration of the political and human 
rights aspect of the Kurdish problem." 
  Several of those requests may be related to matters on which 
Turkey already wishes to adopt a decision in accordance with its 
own will. 
  However, let us consider the side that should be blamed for 
the inclusion of those matters in that letter... Furthermore, 
let us consider the self-exaltation for "having received such a 
letter..." Is there any aspect of that development that would 
make a serious state feel "relieved?"

<F P=106> ["Commentary" column by Sami Kohen: "How Does the United </F>
States View Turkey? (1) -- A New Snag in Relations"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Turkish-U.S. relations are entering a 
difficult period. Many people in Turkey are not aware of this, 
but one must not be surprised if a crisis erupts in the near 
future. 
  The reason for this trend -- the signs of which can be seen 
much more clearly here -- is simply the Kurdish problem. 
  Until now, only Europe raised its voice with regard to this 
issue. Reactions, recommendations, and criticism concerning 
this matter also emanated from Europe. The United States did 
not display much interest or sensitivity. 
  For some time now, the situation in the southeast, its 
terrorism and other aspects, have been creeping onto the U.S. 
agenda as well. Especially since the recent incident involving 
DEP [Democracy Party] deputies, this issue has begun attracting 
attention here in Washington. This subject is debated in the 
U.S. Congress; it is discussed at various think tanks as well as 
academic institutions; and it is appraised by the press. 
Naturally, all the Clinton administration services concerning 
the region are following the developments very closely. 
Officials from the State and Defense Departments are openly 
voicing their displeasure and concern. 
  In the past, there were a few issues that cast a shadow over 
Turkish-U.S. relations, such as the Cyprus and Armenian issues. 
These are now in the past. One can now observe an increasing 
awareness of the Kurdish problem. There are two reasons for 
this. First, the issue has assumed serious proportions in 
Turkey. Second, a team that is sensitive to human rights issues 
is currently in power in Washington. 
  These two factors complement one another. If the Democrats 
were not in power, the course of events would still have 
triggered reaction in Washington. The subject would still have 
been discussed in the Congress, at think tanks, and by the 
press. In this case, however, the administration does not 
hesitate to react. Not because it does not attach importance to 
Turkey; and certainly not because it wishes to destabilize or 
weaken Turkey. 
  It is necessary to diagnose the U.S. stand without blindly 
creating anti-American feelings and to reach the appropriate 
conclusions. Let us realize that this topic will be discussed 
more and more extensively in the United States in the coming 
weeks and months. Let us also be prepared for developments that 
may not please us so much. 
  The issue will be the subject of criticism and even threats 
during the debate in Congress on the aid package for Turkey. 
  Various activist groups will embrace the subject. 
  Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand will soon arrive in the United 
States to engage in lobbying activities. 
  Influential U.S. newspapers will follow the developments 
more 
closely. 
  A debate conducted in Congress a few days ago was an 
indication of the new winds that have begun to blow in 
Washington. 
  Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House of Representatives 
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, expressed his displeasure over the 
events in Turkey in reference to the DEP issue and asked for 
explanations from Stephan Oxman, U.S. undersecretary of state 
who had just returned from contacts in Ankara. Some of Oxman's 
remarks clarified the administration's new stand and views. 
  Let met cite a few examples of Oxman's responses to 
Hamilton's questions: "We support Turkey against the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan], but at every opportunity we 
advocated a nonmilitary solution... There are many more things 
Turkey should do (toward a political solution)... We value 
Turkey as an ally, but we also say that this problem cannot be 
resolved only through military methods... Unfortunately, DEP 
members were punished for expressing their views. This is a 
very disturbing development... This gives the people the 
message that there is no alternative other than to join the PKK." 
  During the same session, Hamilton also directed questions at 
D. Johnson of the Defense Department: Is Turkey using the 
equipment sent to Turkey within the framework of the 
supplementary U.S. military aid? Response: " It is using the 
Cobra". What is the total amount of this aid? "$121.6 million". 
  Pointing out that he is not satisfied with these answers, 
Hamilton asked to be supplied with all the details. Maybe he 
will want to introduce the condition that this aid not be used 
in the southeast in the future. 
  Yes, it is possible that the Clinton administration will 
attach certain conditions and restrictions to the $453 million 
military aid (in the form of loans) and $100 million economic 
aid (in the form of a grant) as well as to the supplementary 
weapons and equipment program envisaged for the coming fiscal 
year. In other words, at this rate, Washington could warn 
Turkey not to use this equipment in the southeast.

  [Text] Iran has officially asked Turkey for compensation to 
help Tehran redeem the loss that country suffered when Turkish 
aircraft attacked the Zalah Camp in northern Iraq some time ago. 
The officials have not disclosed the amount of compensation 
Tehran has asked for to be able to hold talks on the matter. 
  It has been reported that Tehran has asked Ankara to pay 
separate remunerations for more than 10 people, who were 
wounded, and nine others, who were killed. Tehran has also 
asked for compensation for the damage that was caused by the 
attack. 
  Turkey will respond to Iran's request after the officials in 
Ankara consider the amount of compensation that has been asked 
for by Tehran. 
  Tehran's request probably will be discussed between the two 
countries.

  [Text] Ankara--Turkey's current account deficit stands at 
$6.38 billion, a jump of 577 percent compared to the deficit in 
1992, according to an announcement by the Central Bank on 
Thursday. The Central Bank said the current accounts deficit, 
which was a mere $942 million in 1992, shot up to more than $6 
billion, the highest deficit in Turkish history. According to 
the Central Bank, the main culprit for the massive jump in the 
current account's deficit was the steep increase of the foreign 
trade deficit by 73 percent. 
  The foreign trade deficit, which stood at $8.19 billion in 
1992, went up to $14.16 billion in 1993. 
  Turkey's net tourism revenues increased by 8.9 percent in 
1993 compared to 1992 from $2.86 billion in 1992 to $3.025 
billion in 1993. 
  Workers' remittances fell from $3 billion in 1992 to $2.91 
billion in 1993, representing a fall of 2.9 percent. In 1993, 
Turkey repaid $7.87 billion in foreign debts. 
  Turkey's short-term foreign loans in 1993 increased by 38.8 
percent compared to 1992 while the medium- and long-term loans 
were up by 37.8 percent. In 1993, Turkey borrowed $5.68 billion 
in short-term loans and $4.86 billion in medium- and long-term 
loans. 
  During the same period foreign investments fell. Foreign 
investments for 1992 were $779 million while in 1993 this 
dropped to $622 million.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "Turkey Faces Its Worst Economic </F>
Crisis"] 
  [Text] The economy is clearly on the rocks. Turkish 
newspapers have been complaining for the past few days that the 
economy has been sacrificed for the sake of the elections. 
  It is true that the government, despite claims to the 
contrary, did not take the necessary steps to fend off the 
current financial crisis which is systematically draining 
Turkey's remaining economic resources. Yet, we feel this 
coalition government would never be capable of preventing an 
economic crisis, simply because it lacks both the leadership and 
the competence to do so. 
  We do not want to say that this government or that prime 
minister would be better for Turkey. We are merely stating the 
fact that the coalition partnership between the True Path Party 
(DYP) and the Social Democrat People's Party (SHP) is not 
equipped with the staff or the know-how to overcome the current 
crisis. 
  The surge of major foreign currencies against the Turkish 
lira [TL] is pushing the economy into utter chaos. The central 
Bank and the Treasury seem completely incapable of making a move 
to avert the collapse of the Turkish currency. 
  This in return is creating some very serious problems in the 
market. 
  The traders of many industrial inputs which have to be 
imported have shut their shops and are refusing to supply the 
industry with these vital inputs. Traders say the foreign 
currency situation is so unsettled they will wait for the 
situation to return to normal before they start operations again. 
  That is why many industries are temporarily packing up. The 
auto and textile industries, which are the driving force of 
Turkish industry, are completely paralyzed. 
  We have to add to all this the current stagflation, which 
further complicates the industrial crisis. 
  We are aware the prime minister and the deputy prime 
minister 
are too busy with the election campaign to attend to the 
economic crisis. But we feel the local elections are an alibi, 
and that even under normal circumstances there is not much the 
leaders of the coalition are capable of doing to salvage the 
economy. 
  This situation cannot continue even a few weeks more. Those 
who do not have fund reserves, those who have foreign currency 
debts and even those who have domestic bank loans will all be 
facing some very hard times in the not too distant future if the 
slump of the TL continues at the current rate. This means the 
ranks of the jobless will swell. It also means that all the 
economic balances of the country will be disturbed, which in 
turn will lead to domestic upheaval. 
  What we are facing is much more deadly than the murderous 
PKK 
terrorist organization...

  According to information received from the Izmir Security 
Directorate, the suspects include the organization's officials 
responsible for Izmir province and various quarters in the city. 
The nine reportedly arrived in Izmir 10 months ago and organized 
in two houses belonging to the organization. They hung posters 
in various parts of the city before the elections and 
distributed pamphlets calling for a boycott of the elections. A 
printing shop has been uncovered in Bursa where the posters and 
pamphlets were printed. 
  The nine have been handed over to the State Security Court.

<F P=106> [Article by Hasan Cemal in the "From the Columns" column: </F>
"What does `the state' think in Diyarbakir?"] 
  [Text] From a Mar. 23 article by SABAH's Hasan 
Cemal: A long table on the eighth floor of the police 
officers' club in Diyarbakir. Along two sides are sitting the 
entire "state". State of Emergency Region Governor Unal Erkan, 
Diyarbakir Governor Ibrahim Sahun, Diyarbakir Mayor Turgut 
Atalay, Turkey's Director General of Security Mehmet Agar, 
Commander of the Seventh Army Corps Gen. Metin Saglam, 
Gendarmerie Law and Order Commander Gen. Hasan Kundakci, Second 
Tactical Force Commander Gen. Ergin Celasun, prosecutors, deputy 
provincial governors, high level security and intelligence 
officers. 
  They are having dinner. There are television sets at both 
ends of the table. As they sip their raki, they watch the news 
bulletins from various TV stations. At the same time Mehmet 
Agar gives a live interview by telephone to the Show TV news 
program. Everybody is happy that the Newroz day passed without 
incident and make remarks in the vein of, "The separatist 
organization is no longer able to rally the people for mass 
action." TV programs in which the fact that there were no 
incidents is not underlined strongly enough, upset the viewers. 
After hearing the news about village guards celebrating Newroz 
in Cizre, they say, "Do not forget that until a few years ago 
those village guards were unable to go out on the street in 
Cizre. If they did, they were liable to be hanged upside down 
from the trees." In today's article I will not make any 
comments. I will simply sum up part of my impressions under the 
headline, "What is the state thinking in Diyarbakir?" 
<H5>  Ozal Criticized </H5>
  Former President Turgut Ozal is being criticized for having 
prevented the state from taking strong enough action against the 
"Separatist organization" in the past, or for having failed to 
take it seriously, saying that they were "a handful of 
highwaymen". These words are quite interesting: "Remember the 
March 21 1991 Newroz day in Sirnak. From morning to evening it 
was impossible to remove the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) 
colors from the flag post in the city square. And the things 
that were done to the Ataturk statue there! Then came the 1992 
Newroz. Demirel's prime ministry. The PKK was taught a lesson 
in Sirnak. The state displayed its might. Everybody saw that 
there's a price to pay for messing around with the state. 
Today, not the slightest sound was heard in Sirnak. Think of 
the change achieved in three years." 
  A curious line is being drawn from Ozal to Demirel and now 
to 
Ciller. It is being stressed that in the fight against the PKK, 
Ciller is in great harmony with the security forces and the 
military. One of the officials says, "Ciller has grasped that 
situation. She saw how the security forces could be given the 
boost to morale that they needed. And this has been 
accomplished." And an interesting remark: "You may recall that 
once it used to be said that the Republican People's Party (CHP) 
plus the Army equals power. Now Ciller sees that and seizes on 
the idea." 
<H5>  Greatest Boost to Morale </H5>
  How did Prime Minister Ciller inject the biggest boost to 
morale in recent times to those fighting against terrorism in 
the Southeast? There is a single answer to that question: "The 
removal of the Democracy Party (DEP) deputies' legislative 
immunity and their subsequent arrest. The security forces have 
been immensely pleased with these developments, in which Ciller 
herself played a major role. The people of the region could see 
the power of the state. Those who criticize this decision are 
not aware of the realities of this place. (Opposition 
Motherland Party leader) Mesut Yilmaz has been less active than 
Ciller on this issue." 
  Somebody asks, "Can the amendments required be made in the 
Anti-Terror Law?" A curious reply comes: "Don't worry, they (the 
proposed amendments) will be passed." 
<H5>  The Hot Summer </H5>
  Morale is indeed high. They say that heavy punishment has 
been inflicted on the PKK, especially in the past 12 months. 
"We do not provide too many photos and films of terrorists 
killed because the international community does not react 
favorably to such things," they add. The result of this 
punishment can be summed up as follows: "Fewer recruits to the 
organization, more information about the organization, a sharp 
decline in the logistic support for the organization, greater 
demand to become village guards." 
  There will be formidable pressure on the PKK with the onset 
of spring. "Things have slowed down a bit because of the 
elections. You will see after April." They say this will be a 
"hot" summer, with the rural and mountain cadres, especially, 
being wiped out. The numbers of special operations teams are 
being rapidly increased, and these teams operate very 
effectively, they note. Officials keep stressing that the 
inhabitants of the region support the state and definitely do 
not desire separation. "Otherwise, you would not be able to 
achieve anything even if you set up 37 armies!" they say. 
<H5>  Terror First </H5>
  The Show TV news bulletin featured an interview with Kemal 
Burkay! [Secretary General of Kurdistan Socialist Party, PSK] 
This drew comments such as, "Look at what Show TV is doing. 
They are launching Burkay. What is the need for that?" 
Expressing their displeasure, officials say, "Nothing can be 
done (on such issues) as long as the fight against the terrorist 
organization continues. First you must make that organization 
collapse. Then you can think of other things. If you tried to 
do that at this stage, there would be no end. Things would go 
on, as a chain. First the fight against terrorism." 
  In the region "pro-state" and "anti-state" forces. 
Interesting analyses. One person says, "I felt that he was a 
Turk. I told him, Your eyes do not speak of treason'." 
  It is said that certain complaints were voiced at the 
National Security Council meetings, to the effect that the 
judicial process in the region was not operating rapidly enough. 
Some 10,000 defendants, about 3,000 of them under arrest, are 
said to be currently on trial at the state security courts whose 
jurisdiction covers 11 provinces. 
  They think that Motherland Party (ANAP) mayoral candidate 
Nurettin Dilek is likely to win the election in Diyarbakir, and 
the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) candidates in a few 
countries of Diyarbakir. There is a certain, unexpressed, 
feeling that it would be a good idea if the media did not write 
or broadcast anything about the region. Yet, they do take care 
to continue a dialogue with members of the press despite all the 
criticism they direct against the media.

<F P=106> ["Analysis" by Ismet G. Imset: "Military Determined To </F>
Crush Rebellion by Force"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Turkey's military commanders, or rather 
those who are commanding all state policy out of the Southeast, 
have finally clarified their position in public: a military 
solution to the Kurdish problem. 
  Sabah's prominent columnist Hasan Cemal on Wednesday 
reported 
the highly interesting results of a meeting he had with the most 
senior security officials in Diyarbakir. 
  Cemal identifies his hosts as members of "the entire state." 
These are State of Emergency Regional Governor Unal Erkan, 
Diyarbakir Governor Ibrahim Sahun, Turkish police chief Mehmet 
Agar, Seventh Army Corps commander Gen. Metin Saglam, 
Gendarmerie regional commander Gen. Hasan Kundakci, Second 
Tactical Air Force Commander Gen. Ergin Celasun, prosecutors, 
deputy provincial governors, high level security and 
intelligence officers. Perhaps not truly aware of Western 
suspicions on what is brewing up in their regions, the officers 
tell Cemal what is going to happen and how far military policy 
will go in dealing with the Kurdish problem. Obviously, no one 
refers to it in these words. Despite what Ankara tells foreign 
capitals regarding its recognition of "the Kurdish identity," 
views back at home are totally the opposite. As Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin recently told a Western journalist, "There 
is no Kurdish problem. There is only a terrorism problem in 
Turkey." 
  When the situation is such, even in the words of a 
"social-democrat" member of the coalition, how can anyone expect 
Turkey to seek any "political" or "democratic" outlet to the 
"non-existing" Kurdish problem. 
  The full text of Cemal's observations are published today on 
Page B2 of the special section of the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. The 
highlight remarks, however, deserve to be debated extensively 
for they represent not only the dominant view among "commanders" 
in the region but also reflect what is being "reported" to 
Ankara. 
  It is not clear which general made the remark, "I understood 
he was a Turk... I told myself I could not read treason in his 
eyes," but the implication is clear. If the mentality behind 
Turkey's imminent crack down on terrorism is to "differentiate 
between the innocent and the criminal" by looking into people's 
eyes, and only "Turks" are not suspected of treason, much can be 
guessed about the real "targets" of the operations... Cemal 
reports that the most widely heard evaluation among the security 
emperors of the region is that "the organization has been put 
into a situation where it can no longer organize mass 
incidents." This is what President Suleyman Demirel and Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller are being informed. A view which has been 
strengthened by the fact that instead of appearing in the 
streets in their thousands and rioting with Kurdish flags, the 
people of the Southeast remained at home during the March 21 
Kurdish new year of Newroz. 
  Somehow, the officials appear to have missed the hitch: the 
Turkish service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) 
carried an exclusive interview with outlawed Kurdistan Workers' 
Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan two days before in which he 
called on the people to stay at home. Ocalan warned the people 
that Turkey was preparing for a "massacre" and, in order to 
avoid this, they stayed at home. 
  Indeed, although Erkan explained to us that everything was 
"peaceful and quiet," and that even the people--"the true 
people"-- in the PKK stronghold of Cizre were on the street 
celebrating Newroz along with the security forces, the actual 
truth was quite different. 
  First of all, he has failed to mention that thousands of 
people from Cizre had been displaced over the past two months 
and that there was a state-controlled "re-population" of this 
town, strengthening the presence of village guards there. He 
forgot to explain why and how whole districts had been forced to 
move to other cities, and that several thousand people, just 
because they lived in districts known to be supportive of the 
PKK, had been forced to move to the province of Gaziantep. In 
place of those remaining people who "listened to the PKK," and 
waited inside their homes, village guards were bussed in with 
their families and celebrated Newroz along with special crack 
teams. Not even the loudspeakers, calling on the people to come 
out, were enough to move them. Erkan, instead of going into 
such "technicalities," only explained the following: "Do not 
forget that until a few years ago, those village guards were 
unable to go out on the street in Cizre. If they did, they were 
liable to be hanged upside down from the trees. 
  Yes, its true. Because the PKK was "strong" in Cizre and 
because it had expanded its "grassroots." A strength which was 
won only after 1989 when a gendarmerie officer forced Kurdish 
villagers to eat human excrement. A strength which, even 
according to separatist leader Osman Ocalan, "was due mainly to 
Turkish policies." 
  But looking at the cost of "moving village guards" into 
Cizre, one can only be aware of the pain inflicted on all of the 
civilians: forceful displacement of a whole population, raids on 
major districts and repression. 
  It is difficult to legitimize what has been done to Cizre 
in the past by no more than a celebration by a handful of 
village guards and police officers, mainly "imported" from the 
outside. And can this justify all of the "mystery murders" as 
well? Certainly not. 
  But the fact that the PKK has called on the people to stay 
at 
home and that the people have done so, has served to "prove" 
claims that the organization were unable to move the masses. 
But it didn't. For even the PKK leader referred to this 
"action" as a "passive resistance." In other words, it was the 
very lack of activity that made the point. 
  Had the people gone on the streets and celebrated Newroz, 
this really would have been the evidence for a lack of support 
in the organization. And what one commander said with regard to 
Sirnak is even more scary, as scary as the remark on "treason 
read in the eyes." 
  "Remember the March 21, 1991 Newroz day in Sirnak. From 
morning to evening it was impossible to remove the PKK colors 
from the flagpole in the city square. And the things that were 
done to the Ataturk statue there! Then came the 1992 Newroz. 
Demirel's prime ministry. The PKK was taught a lesson in 
Sirnak. The state displayed its might. Everybody saw that 
there was a price to pay for messing around with the state. 
Today, not the slightest sound was heard in Sirnak. Think of 
the change brought about in three years." 
  Yes, everyone has to think of this. And everyone also has to 
remember how this "success" was achieved. For instance, how 
17,000 people living in this city were forced to migrate when it 
was pulled to the ground in a massive security operation. How 
the state supported, funded and armed the feudal Tatar tribe in 
order to control the local people. How policemen burned cars 
owned by journalists, how newsmen were beaten on the streets, 
and how much confidence in the state has been lost through this 
policy--boosting local support for the PKK. 
  But, it appears from what the decision-makers are saying 
that 
no one really cares about a thing about "methods" as long as the 
expected "results" are achieved. And, Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller, who has "successfully" failed Turkey in every direction, 
has "surrendered" all authority and policy as far as security is 
concerned to the military. 
  Cemal has been told this clearly and made this point: "A 
curious line is being drawn from Ozal to Demirel and now to 
Ciller. It is being stressed that in the fight against the PKK, 
Ciller is in complete harmony with the security forces and the 
military. One of the officials says, 'Ciller has grasped the 
situation. She saw how the security forces could be given the 
boost to morale that they needed. And this has been 
accomplished." 
  And an interesting remark: "You may recall that once it used 
to be said that the Republican People's Party (CHP) plus the 
army equals power. Now Ciller sees this and seizes the 
opportunity." 
  Ozal had closed the doors to the military, believing a 
political solution could be achieved in the Kurdish dispute. He 
had also accepted that "a Kurdish problem" existed in Turkey. 
Moreover, this policy had served to restore "civilian" 
democracy in Turkey. With his death last April, Turkish 
democracy itself was set back by about ten years, and finding 
any kind of solution to the Kurdish issue is becoming more and 
more impossible. 
  Demirel opened the door for the military in fear of losing 
his own authority if he limited the authority of commanders. 
Still he had control and influence on what was going on. 
Ciller allowed the military to walk through the door opened by 
Demirel and has given "full authority" to the military. In 
other words, she is saying, "Stop this problem and stop it fast. 
Do whatever is needed." 
  What is needed, then? 
  It is evident that the military actually believes there is 
an 
army-Ciller coalition in power. The increasing domination of 
national issues by military commanders, their growing role in 
daily policies and other significant developments imply they may 
be right. 
  And they have their own solution to the Southeast dilemma 
now. 1. They deny that a "Kurdish problem" exists. 2. They 
believe the problem is only one of "terrorism." 3. They are 
determined to "solve" this problem by summer at the latest and 
4. They will "solve" it by force alone. The result of the 
recent blows delivered to the PKK are categorized by officials 
as: "Fewer recruits to the organization, more information about 
the organization, a sharp decline in the logistic support for 
the organization, greater demand to become village guards." 
  1. Recruitment to the PKK is continuing steadily and has 
actually been boosted by the reaction to the "methods" used in 
the latest security operations. 
  2. The decline in logistical support to the organization is 
due mainly to the forcible displacement of villagers and the 
burning down of 900 villages, in addition to massive crackdowns 
on four major towns. This has cut direct logistical support to 
the PKK but has also increased local sympathy, as well as the 
number of "undecided" villagers moving "up to the mountains." 
  3. The "greater demand" to become village guards is a 
reflection of the increase in the number of village guards that 
has already taken place and that resulted from the security 
forces telling civilians that if they do not agree to take 
state-issued weapons and fight the PKK, they will be "seen and 
treated as the PKK." Sort of a "die or join us" policy which is 
also one of the major reasons behind the forceful evacuation of 
villages and their being burned to the ground. 
  Officials have told Cemal that this will be a "hot" summer. 
That, as of April, "the rural areas" and "the mountain cadres" 
of the PKK will be the targets. That these will completely be 
wiped out. 
  But how will the state differentiate between the terrorists 
and the innocent? And how many people will die in this 
campaign? Last year, both Chief of Staff commander Gen. Dogan 
Cures and President Demirel said in separate speeches that 
"anyone who supports the terrorists or sympathizes with them is 
a traitor." Even sympathizers, be it out of fear or because for 
70 troubled years they have not felt the state at their side, 
are thus targets. But how many targets? 
  Could it be only a coincidence that several weeks after 
Demirel and Gures' remarks, another senior military official 
boldly told the press that "the PKK has 350,000 sympathizers." 
Or is this a message? 
  The military viewpoint, which is controls [as published] 
almost all state affairs but the economy (for which no one wants 
to take responsibility), is clearly outlined to Cemal: 
  "Nothing can be done as long as the fight against the 
terrorist organization continues. First you must make that 
organization collapse. Then you can think of other things. If 
you tried to do anything else at this stage, there would be no 
end to it. Things would go on, as a chain. First the fight 
against terrorism." 
  And what will be the second step? Does Ankara recognize the 
Kurdish "identity?" Yes. Does anyone know what this 
recognition means other than upgrading Turkey's image abroad? 
No. Does Ankara recognize the Kurdish "problem?" No. 
  So what can be the second step? In the words of former 
gendarmerie intelligence chief Maj. Ahmet Cem Ersever, with the 
policy currently underway, even if the PKK is destroyed, "There 
will be other PKKs under different names." No solution. But 
Ersever will fortunately not be around to witness that crisis 
because, after making such remarks following his retirement, he 
was shot dead with hands tied behind his back. Later, three of 
his "operatives" were also killed. 
  People related to the Kurdish issue in one way or the other 
have died by the dozen from "natural" or "unnatural" causes over 
the past year. Gendarmerie forces commander Esref Bitlis died 
in a queer "plane crash." Turgut Ozal had a heart attack and 
died only days before submitting a major proposal for "Kurdish 
reforms" to the National Security Council. Ersever has died. 
Ugur Mumcu was killed while investigating possible links 
between the PKK and Turkish intelligence. Musa Anter, Vedat 
Aydin, Mehmet Sincar are only several of those killed over the 
past week. 
  As the war, which Turks are advised to refer to as 
"conflict", continues in the troubled region for ten years, a 
different and more hidden form of war is going on in larger 
cities. "There is a certain, unexpressed, feeling that it would 
be better if the media did not write or broadcast anything about 
the region," Cemal says. How good it would be not to be 
monitored in any way. How great it would be if everyone, like 
Ciller, understood where the "authority" currently lies and what 
ends this will serve. A total of 350,000 troops (an amendment 
to earlier figures) are now based in the Southeast along with 
police teams and village guards. Meanwhile local officials 
prepare for the most massive crackdown that has ever been 
launched in the region. Even more massive, perhaps, than the 
"security operations" in the past 70 years aiming to crush 28 
"Kurdish rebellions." According to Demirel, "the 29th 
rebellion" is now taking place and it is obvious how such 
uprisings should be treated. This is what is scary, coming with 
remarks from officials who are to run the operation implying 
that it is only Turks who will not have treason shining in their 
eyes, the "targets" of any operation to be launched in that 
region should interest everyone.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas received U.S. Ambassador 
Richard Boucher this morning. In a statement after his meeting 
with Boucher, which lasted for nearly 60 minutes, Denktas said 
that he briefed the ambassador on the latest developments. 
  [Begin Denktas recording] We briefed the ambassador on the 
latest developments. Naturally, the United States regards 
itself as being closely concerned with the matter because it has 
significant influence in the UN Security Council, that is, 
together with Britain. They insisted that a result be achieved 
by the end of the month. 
  However, we must not be held responsible for the delay in 
the 
process, that is, if a delay is in question. The main reason 
for that is the recent move made by the UN officials to put 
forward matters that were neither included in the package nor 
related to it and to refuse to have them discussed. Those 
matters have to do with our security. Therefore, we insist on 
discussing them. 
  A tangible form has not yet been given to the promises that 
were made to us at the beginning; that is, the promises that 
were made in the reports drawn up by the experts. We have been 
informed that we should sign the agreement because a tangible 
form will be given to them. 
  However, a tangible form must be given to the promises that 
have been made about our rights for me to say yes to the package 
and have it approved by the Republican Assembly. That is 
necessary and inevitable. In no way can I inform the Republican 
Assembly that we will place Maras [Varosha] under UN 
jurisdiction and that the work on the rights that will be given 
to us will be maintained and we will gain those rights in the 
near future. Negotiations cannot be held like that. The 
proposal for the demilitarization of an area to the south of 
Maras, an area which is under our control, concerns our 
security. That is a new factor that is not related to the 
package. That matter has been brought up as a new issue, 
regardless of the fact that we have been informed by the highest 
official that that area will remain under our control and our 
security will not be threatened. 
  There are several other issues to be discussed. We are ready 
to maintain the talks if they also wish to do so. However, if 
they wish to find alternatives, then they need time to do so. 
We cannot agree to a process of negotiations in which one of 
the parties would approach the matter with the concept that the 
problem has to be resolved by this or that day, otherwise this 
or that side will be penalized. The Cyprus problem did not 
begin today. Nor can it be resolved in two or five days or even 
five months. It is a legal matter and a question of rights. 
  The Greek Cypriot side has created the Cyprus problem. The 
Greek Cypriots have done everything they can to destroy us and 
usurp our rights. They continue to regard the rights they have 
usurped from us as being their own rights. No one has bothered 
to consider that fact. Several developments have taken place in 
the Greek Cypriot side. The Greek Cypriots provoke us every 
day. The preparations they make and the approach they maintain 
indicate that they want to place all of Cyprus under their 
control. No one seems to be bothered by all that. Attention 
has been focused only on the package of confidence-building 
measures. However, an atmosphere of confidence is required for 
the talks on that package. We have been informed on the many 
developments and statements in the Greek Cypriots side, which 
further strengthen the lack of confidence. That should also be 
considered. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton's New Intervention"] </F>
  [Text] The new Clinton intervention in the Cyprus issue is 
a salvage effort and quite impressive. We do not know whether 
its outcome will also be effective. We hope it will. This is 
so because the protracted Turkish disobedience, which aims to 
maintain an "internationally unacceptable"--according to the 
White House description--status quo in Cyprus, also represents 
an issue of prestige for the American superpower. 
  The U.S. President's interference, manifested in his letters 
to Andreas Papandreou and Tansu Ciller and his hasty dispatch of 
Robert Lamb to Cyprus with new proposals, does not aim to offer 
artificial resuscitation to Turkish intransigence when the 
Security Council's deadline for reaching an agreement "without 
delay" on the confidence-building measures (CBM's) expires. 
Removing the urgent need for this arrangement is tantamount to 
tolerating the prolongation of the pseudostate's life and 
rewarding the filibustering tactics that Rauf Denktas follows to 
torpedo every process. 
  Besides, the U.S. element has another reason to avert any 
adulteration of the CBM's, since it is morally committed by its 
earlier declarations according to which "the measures must be 
accepted as they stand because they are fair." 
  Consequently, Denktas' excuses about the customs and other 
points cannot be accepted or camouflaged politically with the 
new U.S. intervention. 
  So, the effort to do what must be done should be focused 
elsewhere. There must be pressure to persuade Ankara that it 
cannot act arbitrarily, provoke, and renege. President Clinton 
has effective levers of persuasion and levers of pressure given 
that Turkey is facing an internal economic crisis because of the 
neosultan mentality that governs its policy. What is sought for 
Turkey's people is internal tranquillity and prosperity. If 
Turkey stays on the downhill slope it is on then it will pay 
dearly for its expansionist and arbitrary policy, because Turkey 
will be isolated from a united Europe and become weak about 
demonstrating military strength and expansionist influence in 
the region. 
  President Clinton, as the leader of the sole superpower, 
should aim at the right Cyprus solution and also at harmonizing 
Turkish policy with the more general U.S. view of international 
problems in accordance with his specifications. 
  The White House strategy was outlined with the Clinton 
doctrine, which declared: "We will try to persuade first and, 
if necessary, we will intervene." 
  We have no doubt that the U.S. President tried to persuade 
Ankara and his new intervention is probably within this 
framework. But it will take a major dilemma if Turkey is to be 
persuaded and if a more active White House intervention is not 
to become necessary. This should be summed up in what would 
happen if Turkey remains disobedient to the UN Security Council 
resolutions. If we were the ones to pay for Turkish 
intransigence then Ankara would never retreat, since its 
intransigence would insure the perpetuation of what it has 
illegally acquired through the invasion and the unhindered 
distribution of the enslaved Greek homes and property.

  [Text] During his meeting today with UN envoys Gustave 
Feissel and John Paul Cavanaugh, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas maintained a negative and delaying stance. Following 
his afternoon meeting with Denktas, Feissel said the situation 
has not changed since last week and the United Nations did not 
receive the answer it wanted. He added that now is the time to 
prepare the report to the UN secretary general, who will make 
his own observations. 
  The UN secretary general's report to the Security Council on 
the progress of efforts to implement the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] is expected to be submitted by the end of the 
month. 
  Answering a question on the topic, Feissel said he had 
personally asked for the meeting with Denktas and that no new 
meeting has been set. Asked whether there is a deadlock, 
Feissel said never and nothing is ever final but he added that 
it is relatively clear that the UN goal has not been achieved 
now. He said that he would brief President Glavkos Kliridhis on 
the outcome of the meeting but first he would inform the UN 
secretary general about the situation and what has happened in 
the past few weeks.

  [Excerpts] President Rauf Denktas has said that UN 
officials are trying to impose the confidence-building measures 
package on the Turkish Cypriots by applying pressure. Denktas 
met with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant 
special envoy in Cyprus, at 1600 today. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that the 
Turkish Cypriot side is in favor of continuing the talks on the 
package. Denktas declared, however, that the UN officials are 
pressuring the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the package 
without even allowing it to assess the latest developments. 
Pointing out that additions have been made to the package, and 
topics that are not related to the package have been included in 
it, Denktas remarked that it is impossible to be forced to 
accept these proposals by a certain date. These proposals 
include matters concerning the guarantee issue, to which the 
Turkish Cypriot people are very sensitive, Denktas announced, 
stressing that it is out of the question for the Turkish Cypriot 
side to accept them. 
  Denktas explained that the Turkish Cypriot side underlined 
the flaws and shortcomings of the initial package, which Greek 
Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis said he would 
accept at the time. Some of these have since been resolved, 
Denktas added, noting: They were able to solve some of them. 
Therefore, we were not wrong. The rest they did not touch 
because the Greek Cypriot side is not willing to accept them. 
We do not accept this.

  [Excerpt] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has said 
the issue of territorial exchange has never been raised during 
the talks on the confidence-building measures. Kasoulidhis made 
his statement when he was asked to comment on a statement by a 
U.S. official to a Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent 
in New York in which he said the exchange of territory could 
provide an alternative to unobstructed access to Famagusta. 
  Kasoulidhis also said that the National Council will convene 
to make decisions as soon as there are developments. He also 
said the government has adopted its policy; it will await the UN 
secretary general's report. As soon as the report is issued, 
the spokesman added, the government will announce the steps it 
will take in coordination with the political leaders and Athens.

  [Text] Nicosia, Mar 28 (CNA)--The Cyprus Government has no 
information connecting the murderers of a pro-Kurdish Cypriot 
activist with a foreign embassy in Nicosia, government spokesman 
Ioannis Kasoulidhis said Monday. 
  The spokesman, who was commenting on a Cyprus radio report 
on 
the matter during his daily briefing with the press, further 
said that the authorities were continuing investigations into 
the crime. 
  Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, 37, president of the Cypriot 
Committee 
for Solidarity With Kurdistan and a father of three, was shot 
five times at close range outside his home earlier this month. 
  Replying to a remark that the international denunciation of 
Yeoryiadhis' cold blooded murder was behind schedule, 
Kasoulidhis said it would be accompanied with evidence. 
  The spokesman also reassured that the Republic's authorities 
and the National Guard continue to take all the necessary 
security measures to counteract the infiltration of Turkish 
intelligence. 
  Referring to press reports claiming that Turkish Cypriots 
who 
work in the island's free areas may be spying on the National 
Guard, Kasoulidhis said the authorities were aware of certain 
activities but were taking all necessary steps. 
  He said that the government was aware of the existence of a 
Turkish occupation service, responsible for electronic warfare, 
and was again taking all the necessary measures. 
  Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion. 
Turkey continues to occupy 37 per cent of the island's areas.

<F P=106> [Report by Anthos Likavyis] </F>
  [Text] Competent sources in the security authorities have 
told O FILELEVTHEROS that a special "Psychological War Unit" 
stationed in Nicosia as part of the occupation forces and that 
has recently been reinforced appears to be behind some increased 
activity in the free areas. The National Guard General Staff 
has known from the start of this unit's existence and targets. 
  A senior officer (who was not authorized to reveal his name) 
told us the following: 
  First: This is considered to be an elite unit. It includes 
only specially trained groups and specially educated officers. 
  Second: It has its own structure and, although it comes 
under the [Turkish] General Staff, is commanded by its own Staff 
Office. 
  It is a "special war unit" and all the organized armies have 
the same or similar units. 
  The information available indicates that: 
  --The detachment sent to Cyprus has been reinforced and has 
its headquarters in Nicosia. Its ranking personnel and 
equipment are used, among other things, to conduct extensive 
monitoring of telephone conversations. 
  This is a known fact, which has led the government to make a 
decision on introducing "cryptophonic devices" [secure 
communications equipment]. 
  Doubtless, this psychological war unit will organize 
networks 
for espionage, provocation, or even for creating situations 
favoring the Attila [Turkish forces in Cyprus]. There are 
enough signs of such infiltration and attempts to undermine 
within the framework of the "war of attrition" or of creating 
pretexts that fall within the mission of this special force. 
  It is understood that some specific issues and evidence that 
have been collected are being reappraised carefully so that more 
effective (that is, more deterrent) measures may be adopted. 
  It is believed that the president will brief the National 
Council on all this along with other equally sensitive issues of 
national security. The briefing will take place after the 
conclusion of investigations that began following the 
assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis and those into some other 
cases.

  [Text] After meeting Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou at 
Maximos Palace at noon today, Hans Van Den Broek, the European 
Union [EU] Commissioner in charge of foreign affairs, said the 
Greek Government has some good ideas on Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] so the dialogue will 
continue under his own mediation. 
  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias participated in the 
meeting. He said that the efforts continue and added that he 
will meet the U.S. President's envoy in Skopje Matthew Nimetz 
and international mediator Cyrus Vance. He said: There are 
coordinated efforts to resolve the issue of Skopje. I hope 
there will be a significant outcome. 
  The EU commissioner said the EU is trying to find a formula 
to prepare the two sides to move closer. He said the EU is in a 
difficult position because of the Greek measures against Skopje, 
adding that these measures are against international law. The 
European Commission and the EU support Vance and Nimetz's 
efforts and will try to find a solution. Van Den Broek said the 
issue does not impact only Greece, but also peace and stability 
in the greater Balkan region. The commissioner said he is in 
contact with FYROM because Greece has some good ideas. 
  The European Commission will discuss Skopje after the Easter 
of the Catholics, which will be celebrated next Sunday [3 April].

  [Text] Answering reporters' questions, government spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos made the following statement: During his 
meeting today with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, European 
Union [EU] Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek did not table any 
compromise solution but merely asked that Greece unilaterally 
lift the measures against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia--FYROM] for reasons of respect for community law. 
  The prime minister made it absolutely clear that Greece 
considers Cyrus Vance's mission to be particularly significant 
and has submitted its well-known and specific proposals within 
this framework. The prime minister also noted the special 
responsibility of the EU and its members not to encourage [FYROM 
President Kiro] Gligorov's intransigence directly or indirectly. 
He said there is obviously no legal approach on the issue 
within the framework of the Maastricht Treaty and in no case 
would it downgrade the political aspect of the issue which is 
connected to the country's security and stability in the greater 
region. The spokesman's statement concludes: The political 
dimension of the issue constitutes an adequate legal basis for 
the Greek measures against Skopje both at an international and 
community law level.

  [Text] Athens, March 28 (AFP) -- An EU [European Union] 
decision on Greece's blockade of neighbouring Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] will be made 
"probably just after Easter" unless the embargo on the 
ex-Yugoslav state is lifted, EU commissioner Hans van den Broek 
said Monday [28 March]. 
  Announcing the last deadline after a one-hour meeting with 
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias, the EU commissioner in charge of external 
affairs said if the blockade was still in place the Commission 
would "draw its own conclusions." 
  Van den Broek has been designated by the European Union to 
seek a solution to the dispute. EU sources have suggested the 
blockade, imposed on February 16, may be illegal under European 
law. 
  The Commission was aware Greece "has some good arguments" on 
its side, van den Broek said. 
  But he added that the Commission must both "assure itself 
that Community law is respected" and on the other hand use its 
political influence to find a "permanent and satisfactory 
solution" to the Greek-Macedonian dispute. 
  He is to liaise with UN envoy Cyrus Vance and U.S. special 
envoy Matthew Nimetz, who is expected in Athens overnight before 
meeting Papandreou and Papoulias on Tuesday. 
  Papoulias said "efforts" for a solution were on-going and he 
would meet Vance "very soon in New York". 
  Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos 
denounced criticisms levied against Greece by its European 
partners on Sunday, saying they "are encouraging the 
intransigence of Skopje and don't help Mr. Vance's efforts." 
  EU foreign ministers meeting at Ioannina rejected Greece's 
arguments in favour of the six-week-old trade embargo and called 
on Greece to find a solution to the deadlock. 
  Greece claims the name of Macedonia for its own republic 
bordering the former Yugoslav republic, and insists the latter 
call itself by a different name and abandon symbols associated 
with ancient Greece.

Venizelos called upon the EU foreign ministers to be more

are well known, specific, firm, and clear. 
  Referring to the recent violations of national airspace by

has circles of the political and military leadership who 
cultivate a sense of tension.

this statement upon his return from the United States early this 
afternoon. He had gone there to prepare for the prime minister's

  Papandreou was visibly satisfied with his contacts and 
stressed that he saw that the United States is very willing to 
see the issue move toward a solution. The deputy foreign 
minister said that the Greek measures against Skopje operate as 
a catalyst and create some activity around the issue.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhalis Kaitantzidhis: "We Get Together With </F>
the Russians Again"] 
  [Excerpt] According to all indications, Russia and Greece 
are in agreement over the terms of natural gas purchases as 
these evolved following the addendum to the initial agreement 
signed last summer during President Yeltsin's visit to Athens. 
  The obstacle to the smooth implementation of the agreement 
was the right it granted the Russians to build an electricity 
plant in Thraki and sell energy to the Greek Power Corporation 
(DEI), as well as the right to sell to third parties any surplus 
quantities of natural gas not absorbed by the Public Natural Gas 
Enterprise (DEPA). 
  According to available information, the two sides have 
agreed 
in principle that the Thraki electricity plant will be built by 
the Russians on the classic DEI "turnkey" system or a similar 
one so as not to contradict Panhellenic Socialist Movement 
(PASOK) preelectoral statements, rather than on a self-financing 
basis as was originally envisioned. 
  With regard to another obstacle to the agreement (access by 
the Russians to the Greek delivery network), it seems that the 
two sides have reached an agreement, according to which DEPA 
will have the right to determine the volume of surplus 
quantities that the Russians will be able to sell to third 
parties. 
  Finally, the remaining terms of the addendum, according to 
which the Russians will build the branches of the central 
pipeline toward Lavrion, etc., and the agreement will be 
lengthened by six years are definitely in Greece's interest.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Panos Loukakos: "Greek Blue-Helmets Too"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Balkans entered an era of radical change 
that will perhaps soon lead to new arrangements. U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's letters to Athens and Ankara make it clear that 
pressure will increase for an overall solution to the 
uncertainties in the area, according to the interests of 
Washington. Corresponding pressure is also unfolding from large 
European countries that are strongly interested in developments 
in the Balkans. 
  In this climate, Turkey returns to the Balkans with its 
military as a regulating factor, 80 years after the Balkan wars 
of 1912-13, which resulted in Turkey's expulsion from European 
territory. Within the above climate, Athens appears to insist 
against Greek military intervention in the crisis of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  That decision was correct when it was first made by the 
entire political leadership, because it declared that all Balkan 
countries should stay away from a military engagement. As a 
result, that decision limited the Balkan countries to diplomatic 
efforts, in which Athens maintains a significant advantage over 
Turkey and the other neighboring countries. However, there is 
already a huge change in the facts: Ankara secured the dispatch 
of Turkish peacekeepers to the crisis point. Therefore, Turkey 
has reinforced its greater political role in the region. 
  The change of developments since the initial decision 
against 
Greece's engagement in the crisis should lead to the 
reexamination of the whole problem. That is because Turkey is 
now present in the crisis. Following this, do we still believe 
that Greece should be absent? [passage omitted] 
  These facts lead to the conclusion that, despite the 
popularity of the decision for no military engagement and 
despite the unpopularity of a decision to send Greek 
peacekeepers, the whole problem should be reexamined from the 
beginning in light of new developments. [passage omitted] 
  That is because things have now reached a critical point: 
The role that Greece will play in the greater area in the 
coming years is now at stake. What is at stake is the position 
Greece will take as new arrangements in the Balkans are decided 
and imposed. What is at stake is the special weight that Greece 
will have in the area in relation to Turkey and also in relation 
to the other countries of the region. 
  From an initial examination, for Greece to stay in the 
proceedings and not on the sidelines, it should not be absent 
from the peacekeeping force at a time when Turkey will be 
present. Because if Greece does not participate with its 
military now, who will take Athens' view into account later at 
the diplomatic front? And how will Greece avoid decisions for 
arrangements without its presence and against its interests?

<F P=106> [Report by Y. Tsakiris] </F>
  [Text] Look East, North, and West. A new Greece is waiting 
for us and we should defend it. This is the philosophy of the 
new defense doctrine that aims to retain the only opportunity 
given to our country to play a decisive role in the Balkans and 
reinforce its position in Europe. 
  For the first time, the National Defense Ministry appears to 
be getting out of the narrow framework and entering the foreign 
policy and military diplomacy fields. The right of the 
powerful, a policy Turkey follows, is the ministry's new goal. 
The first and necessary move on the international chessboard is 
the change in our country's defense doctrine and the unified 
defense space with Cyprus. 
  It is the second time in our country's recent history that 
there has been a change in the defense doctrine. The first 
change was imposed by the developments of 1974. Earlier, 
Greece's threat came from the North and was not so much due to a 
real threat as designed to serve NATO's needs. But the events 
of 1974 forced the government to withdraw from NATO's military 
branch (to which it later returned) to change the defense 
doctrine and clearly state the danger from the East. 
  The second change in the defense doctrine is formulated now 
by the National Defense Ministry. Compared with the first 
change, the substantial difference is that this change is not a 
result of military action. It constitutes a change in handling 
international political and military developments. The goal now 
is to strengthen Greece internationally and the first move is 
the unified defense space with Cyprus. In practice, this means 
that the two countries coordinate their defense needs and moves 
and their defense purchases and exercises. And the "casus 
belli" will be valid for both sides. 
  The second factor leading our country to change its defense 
doctrine is the agreement by all governments that "they wrongly 
placed their hopes for a Cyprus solution on an ineffective and 
bureaucratic machine like the United Nations. Not only has it 
failed to help substantially, but it has reduced hopes of a 
solution to the minimum." 
  The success of the new defense doctrine is based on unified 
Hellenism, which means--and this is clear in the Defense 
Ministry's documents--that an offensive move by the Turks in 
Cyprus "provides the legal basis for our country to attack 
Turkey from any point, not only from the front that Turkey 
opened." 
  In this way, we will increase the fronts the Turkish Army 
must face and decrease the possibilities of a Turkish attack, 
while pressing Turkey to amend its intransigence over the Aegean 
and Cyprus. The goal is to upgrade Hellenism as a force in the 
Balkans and increase Greece and Cyprus' negotiating capabilities.

  [Text] Paris, March 25 (AFP) -- Portuguese and Spanish 
expatriate groups here on Friday [25 March] protested the 
deadline given by France to European Union [EU] nationals to 
register for a vote in June's European elections. 
  European Union rules give EU citizens the right to vote and 
be elected in member countries other than their own, on 
condition of residency. 
  The Portuguese association in France (CCPF) and the 
Federation of Spanish Emigre Associations in France, called for 
the registration period to be extended from April 15 to the end 
of April. 
  With 700,000 emigres in France, the Portuguese are the 
largest EU grouping living as expatriates in France, ahead of 
both the Italians and Spanish.

<F P=106> [Report by Dusan Radovanovic from Paris] </F>
  [Text] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, who 
has been paying a working visit to France at the invitation of 
the French foreign minister since yesterday, is today continuing 
talks with prominent French leaders. After very useful and 
frank talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe last night 
on all aspects of the Yugoslav crisis, our foreign minister will 
today meet Hubert Vedrine, secretary general of the Elysee 
Palace, who is the closest associate of French President 
Mitterrand. 
  Jovanovic will also hold talks with General Schmid, personal 
adviser of the French prime minister for military issues, and 
(Savior Deviliten), chairman of the French Senate Commission for 
Foreign Affairs. In all the talks so far, especially with 
Foreign Minister Juppe, the Yugoslav foreign minister, as we 
have learned, stressed the discrepancy between French policies 
and the new reality in the Bosnian conflict and the Yugoslav 
crisis as a whole. He pointed out the need for Paris to carry 
out the necessary changes and to persuade both the European 
Union and the world community to adopt a more balanced approach, 
to abandon its selective policy, and to realize the advantages 
of treating all sides in the Yugoslav crisis in the same way. 
  In the context of the U.S. plan and the European initiative, 
the Yugoslav side stressed during all talks the untenability of 
the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. 
The sanctions represent an enormous obstacle to positive 
solutions. The Yugoslav side also noted that Yugoslavia has met 
all the demands contained in the European plan, while the 
European Union has completely ignored its obligations.

  [Text] Speaking to Lebanese journalists in Paris 
yesterday, Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri said that he does not 
perceive any change in French policy toward Lebanon. The prime 
minister said Lebanon is not a commodity to be sold or bought. 
He noted that there is a feeling that Lebanon needs to develop 
national unity and strengthen domestic stability. It must 
consider building the state as a basic requirement. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri affirmed that there is no fear for 
civil liberties in Lebanon. He said: We want greater openness 
toward the press through a reconsideration of Legislative Decree 
No. 104. We do not wish to silence the media. Lebanon will 
lose everything unless it maintains its status as a democratic 
and free country. All Lebanese are against anarchy. We have 
adopted all the necessary measures to consolidate the situation, 
because there are attempts to undermine the situation in the 
country. 
  Lebanon will face a greater challenge in times of peace 
because Israel views it as its primary economic competitor. He 
said that the purpose of the attempts to undermine Lebanon's 
independence is to weaken its position in the negotiations, 
particularly as 10 percent of its territory is still under 
Israeli occupation. Israel, he said, is trying to improve its 
negotiating position.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henri Desaubliaux: "The Left's </F>
Performance in Second Round of Local Elections Better Than 
Anticipated"] 
  [Text] The second round of local elections yesterday 
respected one of the best established traditions: The number of 
voters fell slightly compared with the first round. The fine 
weather over France did not make for a large-scale turnout. 
Some 58 percent of those eligible actually cast a vote, as 
opposed to 60.40 percent on 20 March, the rural population 
showing itself to be considerably more "civic minded" than urban 
voters 
  However, more than two-thirds of the seats remained in very 
tight run-off situations (1,372 as opposed to 2,028 in mainland 
France and the overseas territories): Just 21 were fought for 
by a single candidate, 132 by three candidates, six by four 
candidates, and one by five candidates (Molieres in the 
Tarn-et-Garonne department), all the rest being head-to-head 
confrontations. 
  This second round, moreover, was not, far from it, without 
political significance, even after a first round which had 
indicated better than any opinion poll the current balance of 
power between the moderate right (44.59 percent) and the left 
(40.40 percent), and the National Front with 9.7 percent and the 
ecologists with just 3.5 percent. The majority therefore did a 
little better than in the first round (44.2 percent) of the 
legislative elections of March 1993. That allowed Edouard 
Balladur to say yesterday that "confidence in the government and 
its majority had been confirmed." The Socialists and other 
parties on the Left, with 29 percent of the vote, garnered five 
points less than in the previous local elections of 1988, but 
won back nine points over their disastrous result at the 
legislative elections. 
  The stakes of the second round, over and above the seats 
that 
were being fought, was the control of several regional councils. 
The Right, which had already held 75 of these councils, hoped it 
could win another three or four. Its gains (only the Creuse 
region) were more modest... The Left, which had held just 29 
regional councils (including Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne 
held by the Communist party), had several departments in its 
sights. It thus won the Dordogne, the island of Reunion, and 
the Gironde. 
  Vaucluse and Upper Corsica stayed with the Right, while Tam, 
Cotes d'Armor, and the territory of Belfort all went to the Left. 
  In addition to these direct stakes, there were what could 
termed the particular centers of interest of this second round: 
the fate of various political personalities (Bernard Tapie in 
Marseilles, Jean-Louis Bianco in Digne, Olivier Stern in Vire, 
Jean-Marie Bockel in Mulhouse, who were all elected; while 
Elisabeth Guigou in Avignon, Maurice Arreckx in Toulon, Brice 
Lalonde in Dinard, Jean-Francois Poncet in Laplume were 
beaten...), the solidity of the Right-Left "republican front" 
against the National Front [FN] (especially in Provence; Cote 
d'Azur; Dreux, where Marie-France Stirbois beat the outgoing 
Socialist; and in Creil, where Ernest Cheniere, the FN-backed 
Rally for the Republic [RPR] man, was beaten), the internal 
competition within the moderate right (the French Democratic 
Union, UDF, and the RPR were in opposition in some 20 
constituencies), etc. 
  Moreover, beyond the stakes and these centers of particular 
interest, this second round of local elections gave an initial 
indication of the results of next year's municipal elections. 
Everyone thinks spontaneity in Marseilles (Bernard Tapie fully 
intends continuing this "love story"), but in many other towns, 
mostly held by the Left, the majorities are fragile or unsure: 
Bourgas, Gueret, Valence, Thionville, Mulhouse, etc. 
  In the first round you choose, in the second round you 
eliminate. This old adage of the two-round majority-based 
electoral systems has once again been confirmed. The voter who, 
on 20 March, had voted essentially from political motives, as 
closely as possible to his convictions and wishes, did not 
hesitate yesterday to vote for personalities, with the clear aim 
of knocking out those candidates he felt furthest from. This 
behavior is traditionally adopted by the parties of the Left. 
This is the celebrated "republican discipline" which, beginning 
with the evening of the first round, consists of standing down 
in favor of the candidate on one's own side who is better 
placed. Generally speaking, this principle has been respected, 
with fewer than 12 "smudgers." This undoubtedly explains the 
beginning of the recovery confirmed yesterday. 
  Such acts of "spontaneous standing down" do not come as 
naturally to the Right. Competition between the RPR and UDF has 
not always made it possible to avoid breaches, which has not 
been without consequences at times, either for the fate of a 
constitutency or for the fate of a presidency of a regional 
council. 
  These cases of disciplinary violations are most often to be 
appreciated as a function of the local context, the personality 
of the candidates who have remained, and what can be called 
small-town feuds. However, they must also be examined in the 
light of a not insignificant amplifying factor: The attitude of 
those who, in the first round, voted for National Front 
candidates. 
  Although it was present in only 92 constituencies in the 
second round (less than one out of 14), the National Front had a 
noticeable effect on the vote. By holding a space in 41 
"three-candidate" contests, these candidates allowed the Left in 
some places to either keep a seat or gain one. In those 
constituencies where it was no longer represented, its 
first-round electors did not all transfer their votes to a 
candidate of the Right. 
  The hardening of the National Front was not completely 
unforeseen: Its score in the first round only allowed it to 
hope for a very small number of victories, i.e., less than five. 
So it had to make its presence felt some other way!

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Gilbert: "Analyses and Commentaries </F>
Following Second Round of Cantonal Elections: `Verification'"] 
  [Text] By now the political landscape and its changes are 
known. The first round of the cantonal elections restored a 
bipolar political landscape, dominated by a remarkably stable 
right-wing sedimentation. The second round followed suit with 
republican discipline on the Left, confirming the PS's 
[Socialist Party] resilience in the various departments. 
However, the PS will henceforth be flanked by an individualist 
runaway wing -- whose triumphant symbol is Bernard Tapie -- and, 
above all, by a confirmed Communist entity gathering 
discontented voters: The elements of the future reorganization 
of the Left are now apparent. The governing Right maintains its 
supremacy, but will have to curtail its conquests. It 
acknowledges the limitations imposed by the extreme Right, which 
has strong roots in the country and, if necessary, is capable of 
playing the role of the redresser of wrongs, even though the 
National Front [FN] remains condemned to isolation. 
  The country's electoral conservatism is combined with a 
degree of social unrest which is only superficially 
contradictory. The 1994 cantonal elections were characterized 
by loyalty both in the polling booths and in the streets: 
People have voted and have slung stones at the same time. To 
what extent did the demonstrations by young people -- who do not 
have the vote -- cause the mobilization of the Left's voters, or 
even of extreme right-wing voters? [Prime Minister] Balladur 
did not wait until this objective -- though not unconditional -- 
confirmation of confidence by voters to announce a gesture of 
goodwill toward young people, which will be formalized today. 
For his part, Mr. Rocard is marking time. 
  Within the opposition, the purpose of the battle is clear: 
The aim is to take advantage of the gap between political 
stability and social unrest, in short, to break through this 
gap. The roles must already be assigned. If President 
Mitterand -- having failed to survive the collapse of his own 
system except in his contributions to foreign policy -- has not 
found his way back into the game, Rocard and Fabius, on the 
contrary, have found theirs. 
  The former must become something more than just the man of 
straw of a presidential campaign which is considered to be 
foredoomed to failure. He is now pressed for time. The 
European election test might lead to ambiguous results, but it 
could also prove disastrous for him. Rocard, the leader of the 
opposition and shadow president, must embody the credit given to 
a resilient and revived Left. Will he manage to acquire this 
image? 
<H5>  `There Will Be Quite a Stew' </H5>
  Fabius's game is easier to play. It involves asserting 
himself as the leader of the parliamentary opposition -- if need 
be, with the prospect of being in that position for a long time, 
like Mitterand before 1981. He has the necessary talent, style, 
and will. He did not wait for the second round of the cantonal 
elections to go on the offensive by requesting that issues of 
youth employment and the enlargement of Europe be debated and 
voted on in Parliament. 
  On the Right, the infernal spate of presidential opinion 
polls was resumed yesterday evening, causing immediate 
irritation within the majority. The widespread comments on 
Balladur's and Chirac's respective merits for the success 
obtained in the first round gave a foretaste of this. The 
debate was absurd, as if we had never before witnessed a head of 
government taking adavantage of a satisfactory electoral result! 
The war between Plic and Ploc [nicknames for Chirac and 
Balladur] is on everyone's mind, to the extent that by now duos 
are called Balladur and Chirac. Only hypocrites make believe 
that they still entertain some doubts. As de Gaulle used to 
say: "There will be quite a stew." 
  The prime minister tore the mosquito net before the second 
round by conveniently making use of the coincidence between two 
events, namely, the cantonal elections and the government's 
first year in office. Yesterday, he proclaimed his 
"responsibility." Could he have dreamt of a better occasion at 
the time of cohabitation? 
  He has also definitely foreshadowed his crossing of the 
Seine 
-- this river separating the Elysee [president's palace] from 
the Matignon [prime minister's office] -- by outlining "the 
great structural reforms which, beyond 1994, will have to be 
discussed before the French nation as a whole." It is not just 
five years of legislature that are now at stake. 
  The question of knowing whether the policy started in 1993 
(and prepared, "among others," a few months earlier) will mark 
the beginning of a new era or will only be an interim policy, is 
actually quite pointless. Would any candidate from the majority 
turn his back on this policy -- or should we say this 
preliminary plan? In constitutional terms, one can only talk of 
a transitional period. Mr. Balladur is so much aware of this 
that he had to refer to "the closeness of the presidential 
elections" among the difficulties faced by his government. 
Where would the difficulty lie, if he were not himself a 
candidate? 
  Between now and the elections, the prime minister will have 
to dispel the suspicions felt by a public opinion and a body 
politic which are prone to judge the timing and scope of the 
reforms by reference to his presidential ambitions. At the end 
of the road, he will have to take the solitary step which, 
making him abandon the Matignon's warmth for the Elysee's chill, 
may or may not enable him to play the role of the visionary of 
France in the year 2000. 
  By his own admission, Mr. Chirac has chosen this very same 
role for himself. Freed from the constraints of the immediate 
situation, sparing of electoral comments, he is also outlining 
the France of the post-1995 era, selecting his ends and means, 
polishing his statements, already with a foothold in the future. 
Inflexible in his outlook, lonely as he never before in leading 
his supporters, he is heading for "that pastoral headland, 
crowned by clouds," in [Victor] Hugo's words.

<F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "Leotard To Bring Together </F>
Defense Manufacturers for a Cost-Cutting Exercise"] 
  [Excerpt] Francois Leotard spoke at the National Assembly's 
"Forum of the Future" presided by RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
Deputy Jacques Baumel yesterday. At this meeting, the defense 
minister disclosed that he will meet with defense manufacturers 
soon to sensitize them on one issue: "They undoubtedly will 
have to cut costs." This effort will be organized the General 
Arms Directorate, whose chief, Henri Conze, in a recent article 
in LE FIGARO called on manufactureres to achieve a 2-percent 
productivity increase. You need not be a highly skilled 
accountant to understand that this 2 percent, when added to the 
0.5-percent annual growth rate provided for in the future 
military programming law which reportedly has been accepted by 
the Matignon [prime minister's office], will result in a 
2.5-percent gain annually . This is the minimum growth rate 
needed to ensure, in theory, that all major arms programs will 
continue, although some staggering or downsizing still may be 
required. 
  According to a reliable source, Leotard will invite some 15 
highly placed representatives of the companies involved 
(Aerospatiale, Dassault, Matra, Giat Industries, and others) to 
lunch on Thursday to discuss cost cutting. Serge Dassault, who 
was in the audience together with Aerospatiale chief Louis 
Gallois and SNPE [National Powders and Explosives Company] chief 
Emile Blanc, emphasized that his company has been undergoing 
this kind of exercise for several years. 
  With regard to the 1995-2000 military programming law, 
Francois Leotard stated that, "at the present time, the opinions 
of all of the organizations involved have been returned, all the 
work has been completed, and the results are now being written 
up." However, its contents will not be disclosed until it has 
been scrutinized closely by the Elysee [office of the 
president], probably at the next Defense Council meeting on 6 
April, and by the Council of Ministers on 20 or 27 April.

<F P=106> [Report signed P.H.D.: "Air Force -- Operation White Paper"] </F>
  [Text] The defense white paper published one month ago is 
already starting to spark reform. The Air Force, in line with 
the document's guidelines, has just started to reorganize its 
command structure. The goal is to draw a clearer distinction 
between the responsibilities for conducting operations and the 
so-called organic responsibilities of preparation and troop 
support. From now on there will be two operational commands and 
five organic commands. 
  The operational commands will be: 
  -- The Strategic Air Force (FAS), directed by Air Corps 
General Roger Mathieu; 
  -- The Air Defense and Air Operations Command (CDAOA), still 
directed by Air Corps General Francois Vallat, which will lead 
defensive and offensive air operations. 
  The five organic commands will be: 
  -- The Combat Air Force (FAC), replacing the Tactical Air 
Force (FATAC) but with the same mission responsibilities, 
commanded by Air Corps General Bernard Nortain; 
  -- The Projection Air Force (FAP), which will take over from 
the Military Air Transport Command (COTAM), directed by Air 
Division General Alain Bernier; 
  -- The Academy Command, directed by Air Corps General Pierre 
Warme; 
  -- The Air Commandos Command (no longer just a group) 
directed by Colonel Michel Chabot; 
  -- The Air Command for Surveillance, Information, and 
Communication (CASSIC), which will bring together at 
Villacoublay the former Transmission Command and the organic 
section of the former Air Defense Command.

  [Text] The submarine Le Triomphant was secretly launched in 
Cherbourg this weekend. More details now with Herve de Haro 
from Cherbourg: 
  [Haro] Le Triomphant is a high-tech marvel. With a 
displacement of 12,640 tons and a length of 138 meters, it is 
much larger than its predecessors. It is faster too and should 
also be extremely quiet, one of the quietest in the world -- it 
could even be called a stealth submarine. Its propeller is 
classified top secret and protected from preying eyes and to 
make it even more silent. 
  Le Triomphant is now in its natural element. It will sail in 
a few months time for its first sea trials. The first concern 
of the DCN [Direction of Navy Shipbuilding] is to monitor all 
noise made by the equipment on board the submarine. It will be 
recorded and analyzed.

  [Text] Paris, March 29 (AFP) -- French industry, and car 
manufacturing, is well on the way to recovery from recession on 
the basis of the latest findings by the official INSEE [National 
Institute of Statistics and Economics Studies] institute, 
officials at the Economy Ministry said on Tuesday. 
  Officials close to Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said 
that there was "a very strong advance in the balance of opinion 
by company chief executives about the outlook for activity which 
is now clearly positive, returning to a very high level." 
  INSEE said that the balance of opinion about the general 
outlook, between those who thought that output would increase in 
the next few months and those who thought the opposite, had 
risen to the point of the autumn of 1990 to a score of plus 14 
in March from plus three in February. 
  The balance of opinion about the performance of their own 
particular companies also returned to a positive score in March, 
the period covered by the survey. 
  The Ministry also noted "a very marked improvement" in 
orders 
from abroad and that this affected most sectors. But the sector 
of professional equipment was experiencing only a modest 
improvement. 
  The Ministry said that a few more months would be needed for 
the recovery to be felt throughout industry. 
  The car sector had experienced a "spectacular improvement." 
The balance of opinion among manufacturers about future output 
had risen by 100 points between February and March, moving from 
a score of minus 30 to plus 70. 
  "This improvement arises from the stimulatory measures taken 
by the government and should result in a big increase in the 
number of new cars registered during the next few months," the 
officials said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National </F>
Alliance, by unidentified correspondent -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Fini] I think that who has won seems to be 
evident. Now, there is so much confusion. I for one have not 
really understood, with this downpour of results, exactly what 
the parties' positions are. The only thing that is certain is 
that we have won. [passage omitted] I still have to make sense 
of what the real facts are, but I am extremely happy. 
  [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Your party seems to have 
got 12.6 percent of the vote. What do you think of that? 
  [Fini] I would say that that is very good. It's practically 
13 percent. It's very good. Excellent. 
  [Correspondent] Regarding the whole of the Freedom Alliance, 
the good government alliance, which gets between 319 and 338 
seats in the Chamber of Deputies, an absolute majority, will 
there now be problems with your potential ally, someone you have 
never considered an ally, Umberto Bossi? 
  [Fini] Now, once the euphoria of the results has passed, we 
will have to calmly assess the whole thing. I think I can say 
that the Italians have made a clear choice as to who is to 
govern them. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Guido Passalacqua report: "Bossi Spoils `Pole's' Party"] </F>
  [Text] Milan -- By 2205 hours [2005 GMT] the League had 
doubled its number of deputies, from 55 to over 100, reaching 
the estimates given by [Umberto] Bossi [Northern League 
secretary] and [Roberto] Maroni [League lower house floor 
leader] in recent days. Moreover, according to polling figures 
from Doxa, the League is holding its ground in the proportional 
quota, too, achieving 9 percent -- more than it achieved in the 
previous general election (8.9 percent). This is essentially a 
success for Bossi's strategy, based entirely on the bid to 
establish the League's identity in its internal conflict with 
[Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. Bossi was also 
reassured by the result in Milan's constituency number one, for 
which he was elected. 
  However, the result achieved by the League has not altered 
Bossi's basic stances and has not resolved its suspicions and 
problems. Essentially, there are two: accession to the 
government with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the prime 
ministership for Silvio Berlusconi. In his initial response 
Bossi confirmed this: "The pole for freedom has won, and a 
government must be formed comprising the pole for freedom." He 
then renewed his rejection of the MSI: "No accords with the 
reactionary right." And he barred Berlusconi's path to the 
premiership: "Berlusconi is an intelligent man; I do not think 
that he will ask again for the prime ministership, partly 
because he is someone that has economic vested interests, so it 
is better for him not to try." He repeated his charges against 
Forza Italia, his problematic ally: "They tried to eliminate 
us," he said, "and I must say that they did so intelligently, by 
recycling the old and finding a very representative 
entrepreneur." 
  Then Bossi returned to his original forecasts: "The results 
are more or less as we imagined; now we must examine them in 
detail and try to understand them properly; we could govern with 
the pole for freedom, but it must be kept in mind that over the 
years the League has protected the democratic framework against 
a reactionary right." Bossi was irritated by the National 
Alliance's success in the north, too, and repeated, "reactionary 
right." He said: "We are in favor of a modern and liberal 
Italy, not a reactionary right." "Are you referring to the 
MSI?" he was asked. "Just consider the 12 percent granted to 
the MSI." Bossi was very cautious, however, and stressed the 
need to examine Berlusconi's and [MSI and National Alliance (AN) 
leader] Fini's programs, but repeated again: "With us, the 
reactionary right shall not pass." 
  Reporters pressed Bossi on the subject of possible external 
backing from the National Alliance for a League-Forza Italia 
government. Bossi was evasive, and repeated: "We will have to 
examine the figures." By 2220 hours [2020 GMT] the atmosphere 
at League headquarters was more relaxed. The League had escaped 
the trap laid "by the old regime." But a little earlier, at 
2000 hours [1800 GMT], the atmosphere was different, very 
different. It was tense. Maroni was bombarded by telephone 
calls: "Is it true that Bossi wants to break up the pole for 
freedom?" "What is happening within the League?" The calls 
were from journalists and politicians, all based on rumors from 
Rome. The lower house floor leader was the only important 
League politician at League headquarters, where he had been in 
charge since 1600 hours [1400 GMT], always humorous and 
courteous, but clearly tense. As he passed from one television 
channel to another, he reflected: "If the League loses 
proportionately with respect to the previous general election, 
then we must draw the conclusions and carry out a thorough 
political assessment that must embrace not only the League but 
the other forces too. If Berlusconi scores a major success, a 
spectacular success, the blame will lie partly with those who 
failed to realize what was happening in the country, those who 
mistook `Avanzi' viewers for the entire electorate. With those 
who failed to understand the League's role." In fact none of 
this happened. Sunday afternoon [27 March] Bossi said more 
simply: "Berlusconi was invented by those on the Left." 
  "It is time for us to roll up our sleeves; the voters have 
decided to grant us a very responsible role, and we will not 
disappoint them." Roberto Maroni, the Northern League's great 
planner, the man who, on Bossi's behalf, has organized the 
complex web of the League's negotiations, did not want to 
exclude any possibility. Leaving aside the results as they 
emerged, he took his time: "Sunday 10 April in Pontida will see 
a crucial step in the history of the new Republic." More than 
that, Maroni, and Bossi too, would not say. They made it clear 
that there will be a strong defense of the League's 
"northernist" role, and repeated that the "negotiations for the 
new government will be carried out under the shadow of Milan 
cathedral." 
  The problem that has been facing League leaders for some 
days is this: What kind of government? With Berlusconi? With 
Berlusconi and Fini? With Berlusconi and the center? Or an 
institutional -- or, rather, constitutional -- government? 
Though portrayed by the media recently as a quarrelsome and 
eccentric appendage to Berlusconi and snubbed in favor of the 
novelty of Fini in the new guise of a [French Rally for the 
Republic (RPR) Secretary General] Chirac, basically the League 
has never lost its central role in the political negotiations. 
Late Sunday afternoon [Mino] Martinazzoli [Italian Popular 
Party (PPI) secretary] tried to phone Bossi, and Monday morning 
MSI lower house floor leader Giuseppe Tatarella, Fini's 
strategist, tried to contact his opposite number, Maroni. 
Throughout the election campaign very private personal meetings 
have gone on between the PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] 
Claudio Petruccioli and Bossi's deputy. 
  On the basis of the election results as they appeared last 
night, the League faces two problems. The first is its 
relations with the MSI. After voting at Gemonio, near the 
Edoardo Curti junior school, Sunday afternoon, Bossi had no 
doubts: "I refuse to have anything to do with the fascists." 
With the appearance of a government minister, in his blue 
jacket and gray trousers -- undermined by a yellow necktie by 
Forattini on loan from his trusted Maroni -- Bossi did not seem 
desperate to form a government at any price: "We and Forza 
Italia will govern, but not with the MSI." The watchword for 
the League leaders is, "if the numbers permit." If the numbers 
permit the formation of a government with Forza Italia; if not, 
then if the numbers permit the formation of an institutional 
government; and so forth. "Of course," Bobo Maroni said 
yesterday at 1300 hours [1100 GMT], "how can we say `no' to the 
pole for freedom without having an alternative government to put 
forward? There must be an alternative; we cannot proceed toward 
political chaos...." 
  The other major problem is the prime ministership, sought by 
Berlusconi but denied by Bossi. This is one of the topics of 
conflict within the pole. "The League does not give a damn 
about Berluskaiser," Bossi, in the guise of prime minister, said 
in the bar at Gemonio Sunday afternoon. But his aim seems to be 
not so much to gain the premiership for himself or another 
League member as to prevent Berlusconi from gaining it, opening 
the way, rather, to some technocrat approved by the League.

  [Excerpts] [Bossi] The figures are more or less what one 
could have expected, at least what we expected. Now we have to 
see how many seats we have, how many parliamentarians we have. 
I think we can say that we can govern with the Freedom 
Alliance, but bearing in mind that for years the League has 
guaranteed democracy in the country, and it will have to assess 
how to prevent the reactionary right from getting through, so we 
want to understand things well. [sentence as heard] First, see

government can be formed. [passage omitted] 
  We have a general indication that the Freedom Alliance has 
won, together with the MSI [Italian Social Movement], i.e., the 
vote that comes from the south which will reopen the North's 
wallet, in short. So, you will understand we have to understand 
each other to assess whether there is space for an agreement for 
government. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Do you see a reactionary right wing? 
  [Bossi] Yes, there it is with 12 percent given to the MSI.

of the center, balanced by a shift to the right of the old power

<F P=106> [Statement by Silvio Berlusconi at a news conference; place </F>
not given -- live] 
  [Text] You can see that the figures are constantly being 
updated. This is why we are waiting before we express our 
definitive reaction and satisfaction. We are waiting for these 
figures to become certain and final. We all hope they will be 
similar to the ones we know already. To tell you the truth, I 
hope that in the end we shall have even better figures. Given 
the enthusiasm of people and the consensus we have had so far, I 
think these figures will get even better. 
  I think we can already reach some conclusions. We started, 
very frightened, many months ago. We made the decision to take 
part in the elections three months ago. The situation was 
completely different. There was the organized team of the Left, 
which was about to come to power. They were convinced they had 
power already. We saw before us an uncertain future, a future 
for our country which was leading to something resembling a 
regime, something which would have not been true democracy and 
true freedom. We then decided to participate, naming the 
alliance between Forza Italia, the League in the north, the 
Christian Democratic Center, the Union of the Center, some 
friends among the Radicals, and the National Alliance in the 
center and in the south the Freedom Alliance. Since we wanted to 
work in a different way in order to respond to Italy's real 
problems, we added the name of Good Government. It is now the 
Freedom and Good Government Alliance. 
  I think that -- considering these figures -- we can already 
say that the Freedom Alliance has already reached its most 
important goal: to give our country a future of democracy and 
freedom.

  [Editorial Report] Milan Canale 5 Television Network in 
Italian at 2251 GMT on 28 March 94 carries a report from the 
Rome headquarters of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, 
where leader Achille Occhetto answers journalists' questions on 
the results of exit polls and computer projections: 
  Occhetto says: 
  "It is unsatisfactory for the country. There is no doubt 
that the Right has won, but it will not be capable of presenting 
a government to the country." 
  He continues: 
  "Regarding the Progressive Alliance, it is a team, a team 
that has played for the first time. It has gained valuable 
experience. I think it should remain on the scene because as 
other European experience has shown, the Right does not know how 
to resolve society's basic problems. This alliance," he says, 
"will be able to be an extremely clear and decisive opposition 
in constitutional terms." 
  He adds: "The electoral law, obviously, has not clarified 
anything. Right from the beginning we said that it was 
compromise between the old and new system. Had there been an 
electoral system with two rounds the people would have been able 
to choose between each round whether to let the Right win, 
something which was not clear with this system." 
  He adds: "The Left maintains the energy that it has had 
recently. I've already said it: this was an unsatisfactory 
result."

<F P=106> ["Si.Bu." report: "The Greens Accusation: TV Was Used To </F>
Stage a Coup"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Disappointment, some amazement, a few 
recriminations were being voiced at the Greens headquarters. "I 
fully respect the people's will, but it has somehow legitimized 
the absolutely coup-like use of TV made by our opponent." 
Around 2300 hours [2100 GMT], [Greens coordinator] Carlo Ripa 
di Meana -- his eyes tearful, "but only because of the TV 
floodlights," -- arrived in the Greens National Federation 
headquarters, in via Catania, where he was met by a small group 
of activists. 
  The first figures broadcast by TV were taken in with dismay 
and amazement, particularly as they placed the Greens below the 
fatal 4 percent threshold. "It cannot be, I cannot believe it," 
remarked a young girl when Meana read out the first exit-poll 
figures. Then silence set in, interrupted only, now and then, 
by a bitter comment against [National Alliance leader 
Gianfranco] Fini or [Democratic Christian Center member 
Ferdinando] Casini, who was branded as a hypocrite. Someone in 
a corner was expressing his concern at what might happen now to 
the health system, or to the laws on abortion and divorce. 
  As they waited for the spokesperson, they nibbled some food, 
but nobody was very talkative. Senator Carla Rocchi arrived, 
and remarked: "To be frank, I did not expect us to reach the 
threshold. I now hope the proportional system, which triggered 
off the coalition rat-race, will be completely dismantled." 
Rocchi was also asking herself where [Pact for Italy member] 
Alberto Michelini's thousands of votes may have gone: "I am 
amazed by the fact that someone who mustered so much support is 
now left high and dry. I really wonder why." 
  Then Ripa di Meana turned up. The TV cameras cornered him 
against a wall, but he answered the questions calmly, saying he 
first wanted to look at the real figures. However, he was 
already being told that two mistakes lay behind the 
progressives' defeat: having staked everything on continuity 
with Ciampi's government and having scrapped the 
environmentalists' proposal to regroup the minor parties so as 
to avoid being cornered in the elections. It sounded like an 
attack on [PDS Secretary Achille] Occhetto, on Democratic 
Alliance [AD], and on Rete. However, Ripa di Meana did not wish 
to be polemic. He thanked his allies and said he would discuss 
these problems with them. In the meantime, he relaunched the 
environmentalist campaign, a Europe-wide struggle which knows no 
borders. However, the Greens spokesperson pointed his finger at 
the use that radio and the media made by [Forza Italia leader 
Silvio] Berlusconi and the latter's allies. [Radical leader 
Marco] Pannella and "Radio Radicale" also came under attack. 
Rocchi said wryly: "It will be very ironical if Pannella makes 
it into parliament thanks to the proportional law which he 
systematically opposed."

  [Text] The Freedom Alliance, which brings together the main 
groupings on the Center-right, has won the elections, the first 
using the new electoral system. Silvio Berlusconi and Forza 
Italia, Gianfranco Fini and the National Alliance, and Umberto 
Bossi and the Northern League, won -- according to the latest 
projections -- an absolute majority of seats in the Chamber of 
Deputies and most probably also in the Senate, even if 
projections for the Senate only give the Alliance a relative 
majority rather than an absolute one. 
  The Left, which was grouped around the Progessive Alliance, 
was defeated. The Center, led by Mario Segni and Mino 
Martinazzoli, was also penalized. Unless there is a major 
surprise, the Italian Socialist Party, La Rete, Democratic 
Alliance, and the Greens will be without a quorum in the new 
parliament.

  [Text] Let us see what has changed in the political 
balance, and what will happen to the alliances in the future. 
Sergio De Luca reports: 
  [De Luca] It will not be easy to form a government, 
primarily 
because, as you have heard, the Freedom Alliance does not hold a 
majority of seats in the Senate. Silvio Berlusconi will be 
forced to turn to Mario Segni and Mino Martinazzoli in order to 
obtain the votes that he lacks. However, neither one seems very 
inclined to make an alliance with the Right. Segni and 
Martinazzoli seem to prefer being in opposition. 
  Berlusconi must then reckon with the Northern League. 
Umberto Bossi has already uttered two no's. He has said no to 
forming a government with Gianfranco Fini [National Alliance] 
and no to Berlusconi's candidacy for the post of prime minister. 
These are two formidable obstacles which Berlusconi must 
overcome. 
  It is difficult to make any forecasts at present. The 
postelection games have not even begun. However, it is clear 
that there will not be any clearcut choices and nor the 
stability which we expected from the new electoral system.

<F P=106> [Maria Romantschuk report: "Ahtisaari on EU: I Hope We Can </F>
Reach National Agreement"] 
  [Excerpt] Matti Ahtisaari, the president of the Republic, 
hopes that the EU [European Union] can reach agreement rapidly 
on the unresolved institutional issues so that these do not 
delay Finnish membership. 
  "I hope that results are achieved at the forthcoming 
negotiations. It would be unfortunate if this were to delay the 
negotiations and the parliamentary scrutiny within the EU." 
  He is, however, counting on Finland being able to become a 
member at the beginning of next year, despite the tight 
timetable. 
  At this his first news conference as president of the 
Republic, the president made it clear that he is satisfied with 
the result achieved in the negotiations with the EU. 
  He is not surprised, however, that Finland's national 
support 
for agriculture has become a domestic bone of contention. He 
thinks that first the government must reach agreement on this 
support, perhaps at some time in May, and then hold negotiations 
with the opposition. 
  "I really hope that we can reach national agreement on this 
support," he said and did not rule out some sort of package 
solution, in line with what the Social Democrats have proposed, 
such as tax cuts. 
  "I am very sure that there will be some other elements too. 
It remains to be seen what a solution will contain. I do not 
want to interfere in the debate, but I hope that there will be a 
reasonable agreement." 
  The president promised to follow developments patiently as 
the government forms a view about this national domestic support 
and then negotiates with the opposition. He has not envisaged 
any involvement in the negotiations. 
  President Ahtisaari thinks it neither appropriate nor 
necessary that the referendums in Finland, Sweden, and Norway 
should be arranged and held simultaneously. 
  "The only condition that I think must be met is that we have 
sufficient time for a debate." 
  In the talks the president has held with the prime minister, 
September has so far been the date under consideration. 
  He argued that Sweden and Norway did not enquire in advance 
whether Finland was intending to seek membership. 
  "But it is always possible to speculate about what effect it 
would have if we voted first." 
  Martti Ahtisaari said that national unity must be taken into 
consideration when the date of the consultative referendum is 
fixed. 
  It is the president's unambiguous view that the consultative 
referendum binds the Eduskunta morally, but he knows that in 
practice things do not have to happen like this. 
  "Each Eduskunta deputy will of course reach his own 
individual decision." 
  Something else that has still not been decided is whether 
the 
president or the prime minister will represent Finland at the 
EU's summit meetings. That is why it is also unclear whether 
Ahtisaari will take part in the EU summit on Corfu in June.

<F P=106> [Masse Wallen report: "Esko Aho Suggests Nordic EU </F>
Referenda Be Held Concurrently"] 
  [Text] Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho believes that 
Finland and Norway should also hold their referenda on EU 
[European Union] accession on 13 November, the same day as 
Sweden: "Voting concurrently would underline that the countries 
are starting out from the same position and that the results are 
dependent on each other," Esko Aho explained in an interview on 
Wednesday [23 March]. Previously, Esko Aho had said that 
Finland's referendum should be held in September. Aho certainly 
does not want to postpone the referendum any longer than 13 
November because of the upcoming parliamentary elections in 
Finland, scheduled for March 1995. 
  Yesterday, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt's office did 
not 
wish to make any comment on Esko Aho's proposal. In Norway, the 
parties in favor of saying no to EU membership are urging the 
government to take Aho's request into consideration. Hitherto 
Finland -- a country well disposed toward the EU -- has been 
seen as providing excellent stimulus in the run-up to the 
referenda in Sweden and Norway: The latest poll shows that 48 
percent of Finns support EU membership, while 26 percent are 
opposed. The remaining 26 percent are "undecided."

<F P=106> ["J-ae" report: "Aho Gave Clarification: EU Vote Before </F>
Mid-November"] 
  [Text] During Eduskunta question time yesterday Prime 
Minister Esko Aho clarified the statement he made in an 
interview on Wednesday [23 March] about the possibility of 
arranging simultaneous referendums on EU [European Union] 
membership in Sweden, Norway, and Finland. He stressed that he 
had not proposed simultaneous referendums -- he had simply 
defined the "area in time" in which the Finnish referendum could 
be arranged. 
  As far as the simultaneous timing of the referendums is 
concerned, he merely admitted that "it is possible to find 
reasons for holding a referendum at the same time as the Swedish 
referendum," but nothing more. 
  Questions on the matter were put by Green Eduskunta deputies 
Paavo Nikula and Pekka Raty. Nikula pointed out that the 
president of the Republic had just expressed some very different 
views about the possibility of simultaneous referendums than 
those Aho voiced in his interview in LALLI on Wednesday. 
  Briefly Aho had stressed that it is impossible to fix a firm 
date for the Finnish referendum before the EU has resolved its 
internal disagreements on institutional matters and before it 
has become clear when our EU membership agreement can be signed. 
He had also been speaking against the background of the 
discussions that have been held on the matter inside the 
government. 
  And on the basis of these discussion the referendum should 
be 
held in the fall "long enough before the Eduskunta election so 
that we can as it were concentrate separately on this major 
national issue." Asked about the possibility of holding a 
referendum at the same time as Sweden's, he had replied that 
this is a very late date, but it still remains the latest 
possible date if it is to be possible to hold the referendum 
without upsetting the Eduskunta elections and the preparations 
for it. 
  The thrust was therefore that the "area of time" available 
stretches from early fall to mid-November. 
  Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen for his part 
was strongly critical yesterday in his reaction to Prime 
Minister Esko Aho's remarks about the possibility of holding 
simultaneous referendums in the Nordic area. 
  "The prime minister's vague statements about the timing of 
the EU referendum give rise to doubts about the government's 
real determination to adhere to the EU timetable," he said. 
  According to Lipponen, Finland must reach an independent 
decision on its own referendum without bring in Sweden's and 
Norway's timetables. It is true that it is in Finland's 
interest that all the Nordic applicants become EU members, but 
Finland has its own vital interests to consider. That is why 
Finland cannot tie its own membership to the decisions of the 
other Nordic countries. 
  "If there is a majority for EU membership in the Finnish 
referendum Finland will join the EU even if Sweden and Norway 
were to remain outside," Lipponen said. 
  He also called on the government to stop its dawdling on the 
EU issue. Once the questions of interpretation have been 
resolved in a positive manner for Finland the EU agreement 
should be given its final form without delay and without any 
further maneuvering. For example, the government should 
announce without any further delay whether it approves the 
results negotiated by its own members in the EU membership 
negotiations.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto </F>
by Niklas Herlin; place and date not given: "Heikki Haavisto 
Questions Timetable for EU Referendum"] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto is very annoyed 
with the way the agricultural enterprises and the negotiators 
have been treated by the media: "They talk about `late 
milking,' but we followed to the letter the instructions the 
Eduskunta gave us when it decided to submit the application for 
membership." 
  Haavisto pointed out that the Eduskunta's targets, when it 
discussed the application for membership, were that agricultural 
production should continue at almost its present level and that, 
for instance, milk production would grow. The negotiators were 
to try to get the largest sum possible from the European Union 
[EU] and the rest was to be funded by Finland in the form of 
national subsidies: "The negotiations were conducted precisely 
according to this plan." 
  The EU did not take into account Finland's special position, 
but treated the country on the same basis as Germany, even 
though that country's crop yield is twice as high as Finland's, 
so there is a greater need for national subsidies: "This 
solution implies that, without an agreement on national 
subsidies, Finland may be left with just a few farms producing 
milk for consumption," Haavisto added sharply. Haavisto's 
personal position regarding the EU is also based on national 
subsidies: "I cannot recommend that people vote `yes' to a 
solution that would destroy Finland's rural areas. National 
subsidies are a crucial issue." 
  The timetable of the EU referendum is open. Without signed 
approval of the agreement by the European Parliament, no 
referendum can be organized. The situation is exacerbated by 
the recent hardening of Britain's standpoint on the minority 
vote issue, Haavisto said. There are also many open issues and 
questions of interpretation over and above those concerning 
national subsidies. The EU Commission interprets agricultural 
questions in a different manner than was agreed at the 
ministerial level. 
  Haavisto also emphasized that running down the rural areas 
would be terribly expensive for Finland. He points to the 
enormous investments in infrastructure made over the decades, 
including roads, schools, telecommunications, and health 
centers. If the countryside becomes a desert, these will be 
wasted and new infrastructures will have to be created for the 
people who move south in search of work. "The benefits of EU 
membership have been exaggerated. For instance, membership will 
not bring investments to Finland. It would increase Finland's 
attractiveness, but the prerequisites for foreign investment are 
high-quality manpower and favorable raw-material, energy, and 
capital costs." 
  Something has, however, become clear to the farmers. Grain 
growers within the EU receive CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] 
support for the difference when the price per kg drops from 1.10 
markkas to 80 pennia. This subsidy rate, however -- much to the 
displeasure of Haavisto and the farmers -- is linked to the 
average crop per hectare of the last half of the 1980's, a 
period with two exceptionally severe years of crop failure in 
Finland. The average crop per hectare was 2,900 kg, and you 
cannot survive on that, Haavisto said. 
  There will be subsidies for unprofitable regions, from which 
some 300,000 hectares south of a line from Rauma to Loviisa will 
be excluded, offering Finnish farmers compensation of 900 
markkas per hectare or unit of livestock. According to 
Haavisto, half of France and almost all of Luxembourg benefits 
from this support. There is also a promise of annual 
environmental protection subsidies worth 850 million markkas. 
The environmental support is linked, among other things, to 
reducing fertilizers and the number of livestock per hectare: 
"A farm cannot survive on that kind of money. Without national 
support they will not even get back their operating costs, never 
mind making a profit. This is a vital issue for the nation. 
Industry will benefit from the agreement anyway. But there is 
some price to be paid in view of the risk that Finland's 
food-production industry may loose nearly 300,000 jobs." 
  The European Union, before the Maastricht treaty, was 70 
percent an agricultural community, Haavisto pointed out. Its 
basic objective is to keep European grain production 
competitive. Pork, eggs, and broiler hens are treated like 
secondary cereal products in Europe [as published]. According 
to this principle, the production of milk, lamb, and beef would 
be left over for fringe areas like Finland, since they are 
secondary-grazing-area products. In spite of the gloomy 
prospects for producers in the latter three categories, Haavisto 
thinks that the future looks brighter for lamb and beef 
producers than for the cereal farmers. 
  Some of the member countries are not very interested in 
Finnish membership or that of the other Nordic countries, while 
other countries, like Germany, want Finland to join. Without 
the efforts of the Deputy Chairmanship -- countries like Germany 
and Belgium -- negotiations would have broken down, Haavisto 
said: "The process was confusing. It was not managed properly 
by the EU. Quarrels between member countries caused confusion 
and everybody tried to wrest some form of benefit for himself. 
I am sure that the internal order of the EU will improve if the 
Nordic countries become members."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Norway Expels Iranian Consul"] </F>
  [Text] Consul Mohammad Movahed of the Iranian Embassy has 
been given 10 days to leave Norway. 
  Yesterday the Foreign Ministry summoned the Iranian 
ambassador to inform him that Movahed is not welcome in Norway 
because of activities that are incompatible with his diplomatic 
status. 
  "The expulsion has nothing to do with the Nygaard [Salman 
Rushdie's Norwegian publisher, recent target of a murder 
attempt] affair. I cannot comment on what lies behind this 
reaction," Foreign Ministry press spokesman Ingvar Havnen said. 
  Hans Olav Ostgaard, the head of the surveillance police, had 
only this to say: "The surveillance police does not comment on 
matters like this." Yesterday no one at the Iranian Embassy in 
Oslo was willing to comment to NORSK TELEGRAMBYRA. 
  As far as Ingvar Havnen is aware this is the first time that 
an Iranian diplomat has been expelled from Norway. It is true 
that there have been diplomatic difficulties between Norway and 
Iran in the past, but these have never gotten as far as 
expulsion. Havnen said that he sees no reason for Iran to expel 
Norwegian diplomats at the embassy in Tehran by way of reprisal.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Gunnar Furuly: "Supporters: Convince </F>
Undecided Voters"] 
  [Excerpts] "Our greatest potential for growth lies in those 
who are undecided on the European Union [EU] issue," said Inge 
Lonning, leader of the European Movement. 
  Increased participation in Europe, better opportunities for 
rescuing the environment, and a stronger Norwegian economy are 
among the most important arguments of Union supporters. Lonning 
will not guarantee, however, that unemployment will go down. 
"That will always depend upon the international economic 
situation," he said. 
  A scant week before the deadline runs out on Norway's 
membership negotiations, the supporters of the EU can feel 
confident that things are finally going their way. A new public 
opinion poll showed a small majority in favor of membership 
provided that Sweden and Finland join the EU. 
  "The numerous still-undecided voters are beginning to hop 
down from the fence. I am convinced that it is the pro-EU side 
that will gain most from now on. Provided the deadline is met, 
the national referendum could, I believe, take place as soon as 
next fall. On the other hand, the deadline could get moved back 
several months. Then, the referendum could not take place before 
the first half of next year," Lonning predicted. 
  He conceded that No to the EU currently has an 
organizational 
advantage over the European Movement. EU supporters have 
enrolled far fewer members (22,000) and thus far have succeeded 
in setting up only four district offices. 
  "We depend upon big appropriations. The goal should be to 
have an organization in every county. I am confident the 
Storting will allocate enough funds to enable preparations for 
the national referendum to proceed as they should," he said. 
  Lonning compares the current tug-of-war between Brussels and 
the Norwegian negotiators to wage negotiations: 
  "In recent weeks we have been witness to a series of 
tactical 
maneuvers. It is virtually certain the two sides will find it 
necessary to hold out until the midnight hour has passed before 
wrapping up their negotiations. The moment most critical to 
Norway's chances of joining the EU will surely come in the 
exchanges between the 12 EU nations," said Lonning. 
  "We have the mass media against us but the masses behind 
us," 
said Kristen Nygaard, leader of the No to the EU organization. 
  Nygaard saw the issues of independence, employment, and the 
environment as some of the most important arguments for not 
joining the EU. The leader of No to the EU denied that the 
movement is on the defensive, but conceded that the EU 
opposition has been asleep for a while. 
  "Quite simply, many of our supporters were confident of 
victory after so many favorable Gallup polls last fall. The most 
recent public opinion poll, in which the pro-EU forces jumped 
ahead, woke us all up," said Nygaard. 
  At No to the EU headquarters in Olso, hectic preparations 
were in progress for a mass mailing of brochures to each and 
every household in the nation. The brochure, to be sent out by 
the members at the beginning of March, is intended as a reply to 
the government's information pamphlet on the EU sent out last 
year. The brochure will be one of the EU opposition's strongest 
cards in the battle for votes leading up to the national 
referendum on the EU. 
  No to the EU has a distinct advantage over its rivals in the 
European Movement when it comes to grassroots organization. With 
130,000 members, 19 county organizations, and 442 local groups, 
Nygaard can point to solid support in all parts of the country. 
  "Frequently we get rough treatment from pro-EU commentators 
in the media, but we can console ourselves with the fact that at 
least we have the masses behind us," said Nygaard. He did not 
regard the European Movement as the principal opponent. 
  "Our most dangerous opponent is Gro Harlem Brundtland, Karl 
Glad, and Svein Aaser. That is where you find the muscle in the 
EU camp," he said. Nygaard calculated that the national 
referendum will take place sometime between October of this year 
and June of next year. 
  "The government will presumably choose the time that suits 
them best. And that will likely be after Sweden has its national 
referendum," he said. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Arguments for Joining the EU </H5>
  1. Europe is forming around the EU. Norway must assume its 
share of the responsibility for Europe's most important 
collective organization. 
  2. Membership means participation. 
  3. Scandinavia is becoming part of the EU. Much indicates 
that Finland and Sweden will join. Consequently Norway must also 
join. 
  4. The EU is a guarantee of peace and security. The United 
States is gradually withdrawing from Europe. 
  5. Europe is torn today between forces that wish to isolate 
and forces that wish to unify. It is important to be on the side 
of unity. 
  6. The EU is essential for saving the environment. Only the 
EU has the resources to deal with the ticking environmental 
bombs in the Kola peninsula and the Barents Sea. 
  7. The EU is the best tool there is for ensuring political 
control over economic forces. 
  8. The EU offers us a European democracy in addition to a 
Norwegian democracy. 
  9. The EU will give the Norwegian economy more legs to stand 
on. The EU will determine the future of the welfare state. 
  10. The EU facilitates working and studying abroad. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
<H5>  Arguments Against Joining the EU </H5>
  1. The EU means loss of Norwegian independence because EU 
law 
would take precedence over the Norwegian Constitution, laws, and 
judicial decisions. 
  2. The Union treaty guarantees that market forces will 
prevail. 
  3. The EU has almost twice as much unemployment as Norway. 
  4. The gap between rich and poor in the EU is increasing. 
  5. The EU's joint security and foreign policy will hamper 
Norway's role as mediator. 
  6. There are no border controls in the EU. The wine monopoly 
will be undermined and there will be more drug smuggling. 
  7. The EU will introduce a joint, restrictive asylum policy. 
  8. Through a free market and an economic union, the EU has 
made the goal of traditional economic growth a part of its basic 
law. 
  9. The EU's inner market means greatly increased transport 
and toxic emissions. Norway has stronger environmental 
requirements. 
  10. The EU means weaker environmental policy, and the EU's 
inner market will make the poor even poorer.

<F P=106> [Heidi Borud and Bard Idas report: "Few Doubts in Labor's </F>
National Executive: Wants To Vote After Sweden"] 
  [Text] The Labor Party's leadership remains very firm that 
Norway's EU [European Union] vote must come after Sweden's. 
  Both party leader Thorbjorn Jagland and Prime Minister Gro 
Harlem Brundtland argued strongly for this at the extraordinary 
meeting of the party's national executive in Oslo yesterday. 
Parts of the meeting were open to the press. After 
introductory remarks by the party leader and the prime minister, 
members of the national executive were allowed to speak. 
  Storting deputy Hallvard Bakke, who leads Social Democrats 
Against the EU [SME], was number two in the list of speakers, 
and he launched a crass attack on the prime minister's arguments 
on the EU. 
  Bakke also reiterated the demand the no side is making with 
regard to the party's extraordinary national congress that will 
probably be held on 18 and 19 June: The opponents of the EU in 
the Labor Party must be given the same amount of rostrum time in 
order to be able to put across their overall assessment of the 
outcome of the negotiations. 
  Bakke himself is unwilling to comment on the result of the 
negotiations before he has read the documents. 
  "I checked with the foreign minister today, and the results 
of the negotiations will not be available to the rest of us for 
many weeks." 
  Bakke added that judging from the newspaper reports the 
results were more or less as expected. 
  He also asked the prime minister for a detailed review of 
the 
budgetary consequences of EU membership and wanted to know how 
Norway's EU contribution of around 4 billion kroner is to be 
covered. 
  The SME leader argued strongly against holding the 
referendum 
after Sweden. 
  "The result of the referendum could be of practical 
political 
significance. But I am not naive. Might is right. The final 
outcome can probably be taken for granted," Bakke said. 
  The leadership of the Labor Party remains firm that Norway 
should hold its referendum after Sweden and Finland. Party 
leader Thorbjorn Jagland yesterday argued that there are 
democratic and not tactical reasons behind the desire to hold 
the referendum after those of our neighbors: 
  "We know that many people want to know the outcomes of the 
referendums in Sweden and Denmark [as published] before they 
make up their minds, and this is something we should take into 
account. We cannot allow the danger of being accused of playing 
a tactical game to prevent us from behaving in a democratic 
manner. I will take that risk, and I believe I have support for 
this view in the party, including among people on the no side," 
Jagland said. 
  Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland elaborated: 
  "There is a clear logic in Norway's holding its referendum 
after the other countries. It was Sweden and Finland that 
triggered off Norway's process toward the EU; both countries 
sought membership before we did. And we have to remember that 
it is not the case that it is Sweden and Finland that are 
thinking about how we vote in Norway -- it is we who attach 
importance to what the other two countries do," Brundtland 
pointed out. 
  The prime minister stressed that Norwegian EU membership 
will 
help to unite the Nordic area, while a no could lead to a 
situation in which the EU's external border follows the border 
between Norway and Sweden. 
  "That is why knowledge of the Swedish and Finnish votes is 
of such great importance to the decision we ourselves must 
take," she said. Jagland said yesterday that the parties in the 
Storting are hardly likely to meet to decide the date of the 
Norwegian referendum until after Easter. 
  Thorbjorn Jagland made it clear that the leadership of the 
Labor Party will not use the party whip on opponents of the EU 
in the party in the run-up to the referendum. 
  "Both opponents and supporters have just as much right to 
fight for their views on an issue that will be decided by the 
people." 
  VERDENS GANG wrote in its editorial column yesterday that 
"Bakke and Co. are moving ever closer to what has to be called 
unadulterated splittism -- something that ought to be no joke in 
the Norwegian Labor Party." 
  Jagland was unwilling to comment on this remark to 
AFTENPOSTEN. 
  However, a clearly irritated Hallvard Bakke described the 
article as "a load of rubbish." 
  In his introductory remarks to the national executive 
meeting 
Jagland stressed that other rules must apply when something is 
put before the people in a referendum. 
  "Party discipline must apply in the Storting chamber -- not 
out of respect for the party, but out of respect for the voters 
who have supported the Labor Party's program. But once 
something has been taken out of the Storting, it is the people 
who decide," he said. 
  He also made it clear that SME is not considered to be a 
part 
of the party. 
  "This has been decided by a unanimous central executive. 
What this organization then gets up to is not the 
responsibility of the Labor Party," Jagland said. 
  The Labor Party is planning to arrange its extraordinary 
national congress on Norwegian EU membership for 18 and 19 June. 
  "The date is dependent, however, on whether the EU is able 
to 
resolve its internal disagreements on voting rules. It will 
therefore be the central executive who will fix the final date," 
party secretary Dag Terje Andersen said yesterday evening after 
the national executive meeting.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Chairmen of No to EU Eva-Britt Svensson </F>
and Hans Lindqvist: "Study Manipulated To Support Yes on EU"] 
  [Text] The last of the six studies on the consequences of 
joining the EU [European Union] -- the study on democracy and 
sovereignty -- has now been submitted. Considering the total 
domination of the study commissions by "objective" members, no 
one was surprised that this last one came to the same conclusion 
as all the others: a "balanced yes" to membership, as Chairman 
Olof Ruin put it. 
  We were unable to count more than four of the 40 or so 
commission members who are openly critical of the EU. Serious 
criticism must therefore be directed at the makeup of the 
commissions studying the consequences of joining the EU. Their 
members naturally should have been selected earlier, either 
before the application was made or at least before the 
negotiations began. What was the point in choosing them in the 
midst of the negotiations if not to use them in the yes 
propaganda itself? 
  The no side was not represented, with the result that it has 
had great difficulty in following the work and commenting on the 
results. But the commission on democracy should have allowed the 
no side to attend a hearing and to present its own views in an 
appendix. 
<H5>  Wrong Already </H5>
  Formal sovereignty -- that is, the right of 
self-determination -- will be reduced, the commission on 
democracy says, but that will be offset by the fact that we will 
be able to take part and influence "the common problems in 
Europe." 
  Here the commission is guilty of the same mistake as the yes 
side when it equates the EU's 12 states with Europe's 48. 
  We will be able to take part and influence, says the 
commission. Who is "we"? The subway crossing guard in Bandhagen, 
the nurse's assistant in Angelholm, or the small farmer in 
Morjarv? No, it will be a small minority consisting of 
Dinkelspiel, Carlsson, and Bildt that will get to exercise the 
increased "virtual sovereignty" at a safe distance from their 
subjects in Sweden. 
  Power will shift from popularly elected members of the 
Riksdag to a Commission, Council of Ministers, and EC Court that 
make their decisions in secret with little risk of public 
control and publicity. 
  Our influence in the EU will amount to 5 percent, but 80 
percent of the decisions will be transferred from Sweden to the 
EU, as Jacques Delors put it several years ago, and we will be 
100-percent bound by the EU's decisions. 
<H5>  Superficial and Simplistic </H5>
  The EU is no threat to welfare, said the commission on 
welfare and equality, which was headed by Agneta Dreber, head of 
the Public Health Institute. In an article published in SVENSKA 
DAGBLADET, one of the commission members says it is true that we 
will have to pay an annual fee of about 20 billion kronor to the 
EU, but we will get it back in taxes thanks to increased 
investment in Sweden. It is true that from 20 billion to 30 
billion kronor in state revenues will disappear because of a 
harmonized value-added tax, but we can get that back through 
higher property taxes. 
  That is just amazing. The commission is basing its support 
for EU membership on pious hopes of faster growth and dynamic 
effects. It consistently overestimates the revenues arising from 
membership, when in fact we do not know whether there will be 
any, and underestimates the costs and declines in revenue, when 
in fact we know that the total will amount to at least 50 
billion kronor per year. 
  Where are we going to get that money? We already have a 
deficit of about 200 billion kronor. The question we should be 
asking is: Can we afford the EU? 
  And the commission has been subjected to strong criticism. 
Two Social Democratic members -- Lena Gonas and Margareta 
Persson -- expressed reservations regarding the commission's 
conclusions. This is how they explain their reservations: "The 
lack of analysis between program and reality, the minimizing of 
the costs and consequences of membership, and the unwillingness 
to discuss the risks that such minimizing involves from the 
standpoint of welfare and equality are remarkable." 
<H5>  Forgetting the Flip Side </H5>
  The commission on municipalities and the EU also comes up 
with a yes answer and talks about increased benefits from 
changes in purchasing rules that will improve the 
municipalities' opportunities for competing in Europe. Here 
again, the flip side is being forgotten: the fact that foreign 
firms will be able to drive Swedish subcontractors who have been 
cooperating with the municipalities and county councils for 
years out of business. 
  The outcome may be that the gains and losses will cancel 
each 
other out. But if there are any gains, they will not be the 
result of membership in the EU. The municipalities are already 
free to use the EU's purchasing data bases under the terms of 
the free trade agreement, and doing so will be compulsory under 
the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement. 
  The thing that is most likely to impact the municipalities 
is 
the membership fee of about 20 billion kronor per year and the 
tax shortfall of between 20 billion and 30 billion kronor that 
will have to made up by cutbacks and reduced subsidies from the 
central government. The commission also ignores the fact that 
the municipalities will be included in the EU's convergence 
rules on maximum borrowing. This means that the EU will be able 
to force the municipalities to make further cutbacks, since 
their borrowing will not be allowed to exceed 3 percent of GNP. 
<H5>  Completely Dominated by Yes Side </H5>
  The commission on economic consequences comes next in the 
series of commissions dominated by the yes side. One member, 
Professor Yvonne Hirdman, felt that the commission was being so 
tightly manipulated that she resigned. "Experts" from the 
Industrial Research Institute and the Ministry of Finance are 
presenting figures supposedly substantiating the thesis 
regarding the economic advantages of membership in the EU. 
  Based on a long list of assumptions, it is claimed that 
direct investment by foreign firms will increase if Sweden 
becomes a member of the EU. The attempt is made to present this 
as being a crucial issue for our entire country. Not mentioned 
is the fact that direct investment accounts for only about 4 
percent of total investment in Sweden and that even if foreign 
investment doubles, domestic investment will still be 10 times 
greater. In both Great Britain and Denmark, foreign direct 
investment declined for a great many years immediately after 
they joined the EC. 
  The studies have also been criticized by professional 
economists, examples being Professor Magnus Blomstrom of the 
School of Economics, LO [Swedish Federation of Trade Unions] 
economist Dan Andersson, and Rudolf Meidner. For example, it is 
claimed that membership in the EU would lead to a percentage 
increase in GNP that is 0.45 percent higher than in the EEA 
alternative and that unemployment would correspondingly be 0.04 
percent lower than under the EEA agreement. Figures concerning 
the future are being given in hundredths of a percentage point. 
  Nor is any attempt made to answer the main question: Does 
anyone believe that Sweden's 608,000 unemployed will do better 
in a European Union that already has 18 million unemployed and 
that pursues a constitutionally mandated economic policy in 
which the fight against inflation always takes precedence over 
the fight against unemployment? 
<H5>  Almost Tragic </H5>
  We still have the commissions on security policy and 
environment to consider. Sverker Astrom and Leif Leifland, two 
retired diplomats and former under secretaries of state for 
foreign affairs, stated long before the study was made that they 
were strong supporters of the EU and that the neutrality policy 
had had its day. 
  It is almost tragic the way every means is being used to try 
to get the citizens, in Goran Rosenberg's words, to "adapt to 
their politicians" on the subject of foreign and security policy. 
  Instead of shaping opinion before the decision, Bildt and 
Carlsson are now having to devote themselves to "informing" 
their citizens after the fact of the neutrality policy's sudden 
death. No wonder people are both confused and confounded. 
  Unlike Denmark, Sweden has not asked to be exempted from any 
of the EU's foreign and security policy provisions or from the 
defense cooperation planned for the Western European Union 
(WEU). Sweden has simply lain down and accepted the Maastricht 
treaty down to the last comma, thereby voluntarily giving up its 
independence in foreign policy. It will not be easy to "inform" 
away that reality. 
<H5>  Manipulated </H5>
  Lastly, there is the commission on environment. It is sad 
that a government commission should have to manipulate opinion 
by removing information unfavorable to membership. We do not 
know what role was played by the two active advocates of 
"Network for Europe," Annika Ahnberg and Stefan Edman. What 
happened merely reminds us of the worst features of the earlier 
referendum. 
  The information removed from the report shows that Sweden 
will find it exceedingly difficult to influence the EU's 
environmental policy in the right direction. Even if Sweden had 
the "environmentally friendly countries" and the "undecided" on 
its side, that would not be enough to constitute a majority in 
favor of a sustainable long-term policy on environment and 
natural resources. 
  If the voting rules are changed to favor the big states -- 
and there are proposals to do so -- the above will naturally 
become even harder. We will therefore have a greater possibility 
of influencing the environment if we can pursue our own policy 
in our own country, in various UN agencies, and at major 
environmental conferences like the one in Rio de Janeiro. 
  We would like to put the following questions to Prime 
Minister Carl Bildt and opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson: You 
are both advocates of membership in the EU, but in view of your 
roles, you also have a special responsibility to see that light 
is shed on all aspects of the EU issue, especially in studies 
that are being paid for with tax money. Do you think that the 
makeup of the commissions has been balanced? Do you think that 
the commissions are trustworthy? If not, are you prepared to 
give the no side equal funds for carrying out six new studies?

<F P=106> [Report by Ingrid Steiner: "Austria Should Stay Out"] </F>
  [Text] In order to safeguard the Muslim-Croatian agreement 
and the six protective zones in Bosnia, the Blue Helmets are to 
be increased to 30,000 men. By sending 2,700 Turkish and 500 
Greek soldiers, for the first time "a UN principle is broken 
that says that neighboring states or countries with historically 
burdened relations do not send troops," Austrian General 
Guenther Greindl says. Greindl strictly opposes Austrian Blue 
Helmets for Bosnia: "Germans and some other nations should stay 
out of Bosnia. Austria was not asked by anyone to send 
soldiers." Instead, Austria has successfully provided equipment 
and humanitarian aid. 
  In Greindl's view, the UN mission in ex-Yugoslavia will drag 
on for decades "until the crisis is settled." In no case may 
borders be changed. "As soon as one border is redrawn, the 
entire Balkans begins to slide." One will probably have to 
tolerate ethnic cleansing within the republics. In every other 
respect, however, autonomy, the protection of human rights, and 
the further cooperation of the United States, Russia, and the 
European Union are the only way out of the crisis, Greindl noted.

able to leave Algeria to "make every possible effort to 
guarantee their safety as much as possible and to keep in

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel (FDP) has urged the Chinese Government to enforce human 
rights in the People's Republic. Without political reform and 
developments towards a fair legal system, the economic reforms 
in China would reach their limits, Kinkel warned during talks 
with Chinese Justice Minister Yang Xiao in Bonn today, according 
to the Foreign Ministry. 
  Kinkel also underlined the German government's willingness 
to 
provide support in all areas which would serve to develop a 
system based on the rule of law in the People's Republic. The 
foreign minister also called on the Chinese government to use 
its influence on North Korea and to do everything to prevent a 
military conflict. The North Korean nuclear issue had to be 
solved within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty.

  [Text] Tansu Ciller, True Path Party [TPP] leader and 
prime minister, has said that in the elections, the nation 
expressed its trust and love for the TPP once again, and that 
the TPP is still in its heart. 
  Ciller described the local elections as a victory for the 
TPP. She stressed that the people indicated that they want the 
rightist parties to unite and also showed under which party they 
want these parties to unite. 
  Addressing a TPP Assembly group meeting, Ciller pointed out 
that contrary to expectations, the elections were held in a 
peaceful atmosphere and that the people protected their 
democracy once again. She said that this made her very happy, 
adding that she is proud to be fulfilling the promises she made 
to the nation. Another important result of the elections, she 
said, is the fact that the TPP emerged as the party in the 
nation's heart. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] There is another message the people 
gave us through these elections. We must open are ears wide to 
hear this message well. The message says that the rightist 
parties must unite. [applause] The people have also indicated 
under what party they want these parties to unite. We must heed 
the strong voice of the people. Our people have also made it 
clear that they do not want certain things. They do not want 
injustice. They do not want lack of solutions, they took a 
stand against the opposition because it does not offer any 
solutions. Nor do our people want us -- who have been in power 
only for seven to eight months -- to pay for the bill of the 
economic problems that have been going on for the past 10 years. 
[end recording] 
  Prime Minister Ciller stressed that the elections showed 
that 
the TPP which is the guarantee of stability, tranquillity, 
unity, and faith, is the leading rightist party. She added that 
this unity will add great strength to the country in solving the 
existing problems. She said: The mission which the TPP will 
follow from now on will make it come to power on its own.

  [Text] The Greek Cypriots embarked on provocative 
activities together with several Kurdish militants close to the 
Greek Cypriot barricade near the Ledra Palace Hotel yesterday. 
It has become a tradition for the Greek Cypriots to engage in 
provocative activities on the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus] border at every opportunity. Using the murder of 
Theofilos Yeoryiadhis as a pretext, a number of Greek Cypriot 
organizations rallied their supporters in Elevtheria Square and 
then marched to the barricade near the Ledra Palace Hotel. 
  Some 150 members of the youth organizations of EDEK [United 
Democratic Union of Cyprus], DISI [Democratic Rally], AKEL 
[Restorative Party of the Working People], and DIKO [Democratic 
Party] marched to the barricade together with a group of Kurdish 
militants, chanting Kurdish slogans and singing Kurdish songs as 
they did so. They staged a sit-down demonstration at the 
barricade. The Greek Cypriot and Kurdish militants continued to 
chant slogans and sing songs while they obstructed the traffic 
through the barricade. 
  That the demonstrators carried only Kurdish and Greek flags 
and not the flag of the so-called Cyprus Republic drew attention.

<F P=106> [Report by Christophe Boltanski: "Diplomacy: Paris and </F>
Baghdad Plan for After Embargo"] 
  [Excerpts] The setting was a function room in Paris. A 
number of businessmen mingled with Arab and French diplomats and 
political leaders, mostly of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] or 
associated groups. In total, some 50 guests attended what 
looked very much like a gathering of "Gaullists," nostalgic for 
"France's Arab policy," including former representatives of 
companies in Iraq who have been silent since the Gulf crisis. 
Now "attitudes are changing. This evening proves it," 
according to one of the organizers. 
  The visit to France by an Iraqi parliamentary delegation 
provided the opportunity for a dinner-cum-debate. A deputy from 
the Baghdad Parliament sat in the room, as did the 
representative of the Iraqi interests section in Paris, 
al-`Azzawi [name as transliterated]. The invitation was issued 
by the Fifth Republic Christian Movement (MCVe), whose chairman 
is Michel Grimard. The organization is closely associated with 
Jacques Chirac's RPR. 
  When he invaded Kuwait in August 1990 Saddam Husayn fell 
into 
an American "ambush," the assembled company was told by Roselyne 
Bachelot, the RPR's deputy for Maine et Loire. "It is certain 
now that Baghdad received assurances from the highest diplomatic 
level that the United States would not oppose their troops' 
crossing the border." The deputy, who is chairwoman of the 
National Assembly's France-Iraq group, developed the conspiracy 
theory at some length before demanding "the opening as soon as 
possible of an economic interests section in Baghdad, the 
release of Iraq assets held in French banks for the purchase of 
food and pharmaceuticals supplies, and a more flexible policy on 
visas." 
  In solemn tones, Paul Depis, a former ambassador to Baghdad, 
recalled the golden years of Franco-Iraqi cooperation. French 
enterprises "invested 130-150 billion francs" from 1973 through 
1989. Above all, he said, by advancing beyond the Euphrates, 
France succeeded in encroaching on "a British reserve." 
  Having long been in the minority, the advocates of a new 
Paris-Baghdad axis -- if not political, then at least economic 
-- can now count on the support of part of the Balladur 
government. Thus Daniel Garrigue, another RPR deputy, expressed 
satisfaction with France's action within the UN Security 
Council. For the first time since the Gulf crisis, its 
representative in New York on 17 March publicly opposed the 
United States and Britain over the renewal of the international 
sanctions against Iraq. 
  As it does every two months, the United Nations had to renew 
the oil and military embargo and the measures to freeze Iraqi 
assets abroad. This time Paris, backed by China and Russia, 
urged that recognition be given for the "progress made by 
Baghdad." The destruction of its chemical, nuclear, and 
biological weapons is being completed. The long-term monitoring 
of Iraq's arsenal of death is being established. According to 
French diplomats, these "efforts" deserve to be encouraged. 
  The United Nations is giving itself six months in which to 
establish an adequate surveillance system. France is pleading 
for the lifting of the oil embargo as soon as this trial period 
is over. It accuses its former allies of trying to impose on 
Iraq conditions not envisaged by the UN documents. The English 
[as published] and British consider this too short a time and 
are refusing to grant Baghdad a blank check. They maintain that 
Saddam Husayn is simply trying to allay suspicion. He has not 
recognized the new line of the Iraqi-Kuwait border and is still 
violating human rights. [passage omitted] 
  Sa'di Mahdi Salih, speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, welcomes 
France's new stance. The Balladur government "can persuade the 
other sides, including the United States and Britain, to lift 
the embargo," he told us Friday [25 March]. Western diplomats 
do not fear a French defection, but do consider the policy a 
dangerous one, "because it threatens to mislead the Iraqis into 
believing that the Western camp has weakened." Already on the 
eve of the UN vote, Saddam Husayn adopted a louder tone and 
massed troops near Iraqi Kurdistan, in the belief that he could 
thus bring pressure to bear on the Security Council.

<F P=106> [Ola Hellblom report: "New Cod War Could Prevent Swedish EU </F>
Membership"] 
  [Text] Copenhagen -- A promise from the European Union [EU] 
that Sweden will be given a higher cod quota in the Baltic Sea 
has caused an outcry among Danish politicians and fishermen. 
One Danish representative in the European Parliament is now 
threatening to vote against Swedish membership of the EU. 
  During the last, hectic night of talks on the EU agreement, 
Sweden succeeded in negotiating a higher cod quota in the Baltic 
Sea. The increased share of Baltic cod can only be taken from 
EU member states Denmark and Germany. Neither Denmark nor 
Germany has approved the Swedish fisheries agreement, and Danish 
politicians in the European Parliament are so indignant about it 
that they are thinking of voting against Swedish EU membership 
unless the fisheries agreement is altered. 
  In the past, Sweden has had 24 percent of the total cod 
quota 
in the Baltic Sea, which amounts to 60,000 tonnes. The EU 
member states, i.e., Denmark and Germany, share 36 percent 
between them. The remaining 40 percent is split between Russia, 
Poland, and the Baltic states. "Next year the total cod quota 
in the Baltic Sea will increase to at least 80,000 tonnes. 
Under the terms of the EU agreement, the Swedish quota will 
increase by 5 percent," Stefan de Mare, chief negotiator for the 
Swedish fisheries sector at the talks with the EU on accession, 
said. 
  Danish Fisheries Minister Bjorn Westh said that the Swedish 
agreement was a technical error and that Denmark, together with 
Germany, will try to change it. Danish MEP [European Parliament 
Member] Niels Anker Kofoed, who represents Bornholm, described 
the agreement as scandalous. He is considering voting against 
Swedish membership in the European Parliament unless the 
agreement is changed back. Fishermen from Bornholm, who are 
highly dependent on cod fishing, were recently promised higher 
quotas next year. A higher Swedish quota could wreck their 
chances of this, too. The Bornholm fishermen have lodged a 
protest with Fisheries Minister Bjorn Westh.

  [Text] Vienna/Beijing -- The chances for a war in the 
Korean peninsula are "big" if the United States deploys Patriot 
missiles in South Korea and if it carries out the Team Spirit 
maneuvers, the North Korean ambassador to Austria, Kim 
Kwang-sop, has stated. North Korea is afraid of a military 
strike by South Korea, Kim stressed on Tuesday [29 March]. [as 
published] North Korea is strong enough to defend itself. 
Pyongyang pleads in favor of a peaceful solution to the 
conflict and is not preparing for a war. However, if a war 
should break out, it will "spread to other regions" and end in a 
"big catastrophe." 
  Kim rejected reports that his country is preparing for a 
war. 
"North Korea is a very small country and Korea is divided. How 
can we attack South Korea, the United States, or Japan? We do 
not understand the purpose of this propaganda." Yet the 
ambassador admitted that North Korea is in a position to produce 
missiles: "We have the possibility to produce missiles." 
However, numerous countries are able to do so. North Korea is 
not building nuclear weapons, he stated. 
  In the meantime, China has apparently been successful in 
rejecting sanctions and in demanding talks with the Stalinist 
country. During his visit to the PRC, South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam stated in Beijing on Tuesday that he believes the 
problem can be solved smoothly through dialogue and negotiations.

  [Text] Geneva, March 30 (AFP) -- GATT negotiators were 
unable to agree on a draft final ministerial statement on the 
Uruguay Round on Wednesday [30 March] owing to disagreement 
between the United States and developing countries on inclusion 
of a clause on social conditions for workers, GATT officials 
said. 
  The negotiators, who have approved all the non-controversial 
documents which are to be presented to the GATT ministerial 
conference in Marrakesh from April 12 to 15, also set aside a 
document approving the creation of a committee to prepare for 
the setting up of the World Trade Organisation which is to 
replace the GATT in 1995.

<F P=106> [By Jan Kristiansen] </F>
  [Excerpts] Geneva, March 29 (AFP) -- GATT trade negotiators 
expressed concern Tuesday [29 March] that the an upcoming summit 
may be marred by a clash between the United States and Asian, 
Latin American and African countries over workers' rights. 
  They said the issue could blow up when ministers of 120 
countries meet in the southern Moroccan city of Marrakesh from 
April 12 to 15 to sign a world trade pact and adopt the mandate 
of a panel to prepare the launching of a new World Trade 
Organization (WTO) next year. 
  The ministers are also set to adopt a formal declaration. 
  "It would be grotesque if we allowed the Uruguay Round to 
stumble at the last second after seven years of really hard 
work," a European delegation head said. The first priority must 
be to seal the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of GATT trade 
negotiations "and take things a step further from there." 
[passage omitted] 
  European officials said much would depend on how hard the 
United States presses the issue when the body supervising the 
Uruguay Round meets here Wednesday to formally adopt the draft 
texts to be approved by ministers at Marrakesh. 
  Last week's U.S. bid to get a reference to labour rights 
included in documents to be adopted at Marrakesh was again 
firmly rejected by a spokesman of the developing countries late 
Monday. 
  Most delegations to the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) indeed questioned the "wisdom" of the U.S. move, 
senior diplomats said. 
  They said Washington was "pretty isolated" on this issue 
although France was lending its support, unleashing a "hot 
internal discussion" inside the European Union where "social 
dumping" -- selling goods produced with cheap labor under poor 
working conditions -- has become a keenly debated question. 
  And they suggested that by pushing the matter so hard, 
Washington had indeed laid itself open to suspicion that it 
might want to invoke sub-standard labour conditions in a given 
country to restrict imports of its products. [passage omitted] 
  One senior trade diplomat said there was "no way" Washington 
could get a reference to labour rights into a "mutilaterally 
agreed text" at this point. 
  Officials said the European Union was proposing a wording 
stressing that the committee was free to tackle "new issues," 
without any specific reference to labour rights. [passage 
omitted] 
  GATT officials were worried that the row triggered by the 
United States might "spoil the atmosphere" of the Marrakesh 
meeting. But they said this was "not something that will sink 
the Uruguay Round."

  [Excerpt] Geneva, March 29 (AFP) -- The Uruguay Round of 
trade negotiations under GATT will produce a higher than 
expected global tariff reduction of 40 percent for traded goods, 
trade diplomats said here Tuesday [29 March]. 
  This is seven percentage points in excess of the initial 
objective of 33 percent for tariff cutting under the 
seven-year-old negotiations, to be finalized in two weeks by a 
GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) ministerial 
conference at Marrakesh, Morocco. 
  The 40 percent overall reduction in customs duties will be 
formally announced in a draft declaration to be adopted by 
ministers from about 120 countries at Marrakesh. 
  Trade negotiators here said the tariff-cutting excercise was 
completed when a number of countries tabled their final market 
access offers here on Monday after intensive bilateral talks 
since the Final Act of the Uruguay Round was adopted here last 
December 15. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Sophie Huet: "Prime Minister Reaffirms Authority </F>
of United Nations"] 
  [Excerpt] Yesterday, Edouard Balladur spoke of "the end of 
East-West antagonism" which "has increased the freedom of 
countries and peoples." However, "this freedom means that 
international relations must be organized better." Addressing 
the 91st Interparliamentary Union Conference [IPU] at UNESCO 
Headquarters, which ends its work on Saturday, the prime 
minister reaffirmed the authority of the United Nations, which 
"remains the only organization with the legitimacy enabling it 
to make decisions and act on behalf of the entire international 
community." 
  According to Edouard Balladur, the United Nations should not 
be "deprived of the control of executing the decisions it 
adopts," and, to this end, it must "be given the means which it 
is currently lacking." "Admittedly, defense organizations can 
act in support, as is the case in the former Yugoslavia, but 
they cannot act instead and in place of the United Nations," 
insisted Balladur, who has asked Senator Francois Trucy for a 
report on the adaptation of French military resources for 
missions carried out within the UN framework. The prime 
minister then added that "a great deal remains to be done," 
especially in the area of improving civil and military 
procedures. 
<H5>  Praise for the French-Speaking World </H5>
  The prime minister, who has proposed a "pact of stability in 
Europe," which will be launched at a conference in Paris 26-27 
May, said that it was not a question of "a new institution or a 
new declaration," but of an "exercise in preventive diplomacy," 
aimed at "stanching any sources of divergence or friction" 
between the countries "with a calling to join the European 
Union." This document, Balladur insisted, "will mark the entry 
of our continent into a new era of stability and prosperity."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The European Commission itself 
did not make its opinion known [on the Ioannina voting rights 
compromise]. It will do so today when the permanent 
representatives of the Twelve meet in Brussels to "enact" the 
compromise. 
  Apparently, it will respond positively, although Jacques 
Delors is concerned about "negative jurisprudence" in the 
perspective of 1996 [EU institutional reforms]. Just two 
Commissioners yesterday expressed real reservations. One of 
them, Christiane Scrivener of France, spoke of "a dangerous and 
worrying step backward" compared with the progress made in the 
Single European Act of 1987. 
  Mrs. Scrivener knows full well the problems of finding a 
consensus, since her brief -- taxation -- is one of the last to 
require a unanimous vote. For her, the Ioannina compromise "is 
an attack on the qualified majority" while, on the contrary, an 
enlarged Europe needs a clearer "decisionmaking process." 
  Of course there is still the major review to come in 1996 
but, she says, "work will continue until at least 1998" and in 
the mean time Europe runs the risk of getting bogged down....

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent in Brussels] </F>
  [Text] Belgium today signalled its formal approval of the 
European voting rights compromise--the only member state apart 
from Britain which might have refused to accept the terms. There 
had been fears that the pro-federal Belgians would consider the 
deal on offer to Britain too favourable, but the current EU 
[European Union] Greek presidency announced in Brussels that 
assent had been received. 
  As the formal backing of the other member states was 
awaited, 
arrangement were going on for a formal enlargement ceremony in 
Brussels tomorrow between the 12 existing governments and the 
four newcomers--Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria. 
  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who has commuted between 
Brussels and London for weeks battling to avoid giving ground on 
voting rights, will not be returning to Brussels for the final 
act: the Government will be represented by its ambassador to the 
EU Sir John Kerr, the man responsible for overseeing the 
Government's European policy. The ceremony will be carried out 
amid relief, particularly in the four accession countries, that 
enlargement is still on course for the start of next year. 
  But two more crucial hurdles remain. The European Parliament 
must now endorse the accession terms in the first week of May if 
the timetable is to be maintained. And finally, all four 
applicant countries will be holding national referendums--and 
the outcome of Norway's at least, is in serious doubt. A 
majority of Norwegians are opposed to EU membership, and the 
British-led row over voting has not improved the mood.

<F P=106> ["P.A." report: "France Satisfied With Ioannina Compromise"] </F>
  [Text] Following talks between the French prime minister 
and the French president, France will today agree to the 
compromise arrived at by the Twelve this weekend in Ioannina in 
Greece on the disputed voting rights issue within the European 
Council. [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur's advisers stressed 
on Monday [28 March] that there was "nothing of concern" in this 
formula which, as France and most of its partners had wanted, 
keeps the blocking minority in the Council at 30 percent of the 
votes. To take into account the enlargement of the European 
Union [EU] to 16 members, this minority will pass from 23 votes 
out of 76 to 27 out of 90 on 1 January 1995. 
  The compromise reached to meet the concerns of the British 
and the Spanish -- the obligation to arrive at a consensus 
agreement within a "reasonable time" in the event of there being 
a minority of 23 to 26 votes opposing a decision -- appeared 
yesterday to pose less of a problem to Paris than it had the 
night before when Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had considered 
this arrangement to be "too imprecise." A government expert on 
European issues said: "We have put into writing what is 
currently the usual practice." To illustrate the artificial 
nature of the debate on the voting rights, he stressed that it 
is very rare that a formal vote is needed (in his opinion "10 
times at most" in more than 30 years of European Council 
meetings, which is probably a considerable underestimation) and 
that "each time a EC state considers that a decision poses a 
problem for it, either politically or economically, and even if 
it stands alone in this, no decision is made." 
<H5>  More Reservations in Brussels Than in Paris </H5>
  Unless it is given a legal value by writing it into the EU 
treaties, as London has demanded, the formalization of what was 
until now simply common practice has apparently led to more 
reservations in Brussels than in Paris. In the European circles 
of the Belgian capital, it is suspected that the Ioannina 
compromise will aggravate the risks of paralysis of the European 
Council, at least until 1996 when the reform of Community 
institutions begins, as provided for in the Maastricht Treaty. 
  The French Government does not underestimate this risk, but 
nor does it regard it as a catastrophe. After all, a senior 
French official observed, the ability of the European Council to 
make decisions has only been partially altered since several 
areas -- some of the most important ones -- of Council activity 
are not affected by the Ioannina procedure. This notably 
includes decisions relating to the budget, taxation, and trade 
policy. 
  The European governments have until this evening to make 
their feelings known on this institutional compromise. In Paris 
yesterday it was hoped that no one would now block an 
arrangement that had had such a difficult birth.

  [Text] According to Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana, 
Spain supports Malta's EU [European Union] membership bid and 
urges ending the dialogue phase in order to start the formal 
negotiations. 
  Javier Solana made a short visit to Malta on Monday [28 
March] where he met President Vincent Censu, the prime minister, 
and the foreign minister. 
  Solana believes that one should work in the areas of 
politics, economics, and the institutions to find ways that will 
allow this country to join the EU. According to Solana, the 
discussions of these three points essential for a rapid 
accession are progressing well, and the dialogue that started 
over the last few years is about to come to a conclusion. Malta 
applied for EU membership in July 1990.

<F P=106> [Guy de Jonquieres report: "Hiddens Hurdles for Uruguay </F>
Round"] 
  [Text] When ministers from more than 100 countries gather 
in Marrakesh, Morocco, next month to sign the Uruguay Round, 
there is bound to be much self-congratulation on having achieved 
the most far-reaching world trade liberalisation package in 
history. 
  However, their festive spirit will be tempered by awareness 
that the deal will not be finally in the bag until it has been 
ratified by their own legislatures -- or at least by most of the 
economically more important members of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. And on that score, a number of worrying 
uncertainties remain. 
  Negotiators have agreed in principle that the process should 
be completed in time for the Round's provisions including 
establishment of the planned World Trade Organisation [WTO], to 
take effect by July 1 next year. 
  But urged on by the GATT secretariat, several leading 
industrialised powers have indicated that they are aiming for 
ratification by the end of this year. Though the deadline is 
informal, it has started to acquire considerable psychological 
importance in Geneva. However, it also looks increasingly 
ambitious. While all governments say they are confident of 
mustering the necessary legislative backing, there are growing 
risks that ratification could be sidetracked in several national 
capitals by procedural complications or by political obstacles 
not directly related to trade policy. 
  Serious delays among the "Quad" powers -- the United States, 
the European Union, Japan and Canada -- would defer realisation 
of the economic benefits of further trade liberalisation. 
Equally important, they could check the momentum by lessening 
the pressure on other, smaller, countries to ensure speedy 
ratification of the Round. 
  Until recently, the main doubts centred on the prospects for 
early action by the U.S. Congress. Not only have these deepened 
since the start of this year; but fresh uncertainties have 
emerged about the outlook in the EU [European Union], where an 
internal wrangle has arisen over jurisdictional issues, and in 
Japan, where parliament is already late with its existing 
timetable. 
  In the United States, the Clinton Administration had 
originally aimed for congressional ratification before the 
summer recess. But the timetable has been jolted by the need to 
compensate for revenue losses caused by planned tariff cuts. 
  The losses have been put at at least $13.5 billion (9.2 
billion pounds) over five years. Mr Richard Gephardt, leader of 
the House Democrats, has suggested they could total $40 billion 
in the next decade. Under budget rules, the shortfall must be 
made good by tax rises or reduced spending. 
  In Europe, the fate of the Round has been complicated by an 
arcane controversy about who is entitled to ratify it on behalf 
of the EU. The European Commission backed by the European 
Parliament, claims it has the necessary authority. But most 
member governments disagree. The 12 contend that while the 
Commission was empowered to negotiate on their behalf, EU law 
requires that their own parliaments approve those parts of the 
package dealing with the creation of the WTO liberalisation of 
services and intellectual property rights. 
  In an effort to resolve the row, Brussels plans next month 
to 
seek an opinion from the European Court. The Commission claims 
to be confident of a decision in its favour which would enable 
it to ratify the entire agreement and leave national parliaments 
to give their assent at their leisure. 
  However, there are two possible catches. One is that the 
court is unlikely to rule before autumn at the earliest. The 
other is that if its ruling goes against Brussels, the EU will 
be unable to ratify the Round until it has been approved by 
every national parliament. 
  The Japanese parliament will be unable to tackle the Uruguay 
Round during its current session because of blocking tactics by 
the Liberal Democratic party, which has refused to discuss the 
coming year's budget until prime minister Morohiro Hosokawa 
divulges more details about a YlOO million [Yen] (637,000 
pounds) loan from a trucking company. 
  The package will be submitted to a special parliamentary 
session in the autumn, which will also be asked to consider 
controversial tax reform proposals and a bill to redraw the 
country's electoral boundaries. "It is going to be a very tight 
schedule," says Mr Koro Bessho, director of the foreign 
ministry's GATT division.

  [Excerpt] Ioannina (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel does not expect a decisive breakthrough to be reached at 
the meeting with his counterparts from the European Union [EU] 
countries in Greece this weekend regarding the controversy in 
the European Union about the distribution of power in an 
extended Council of Ministers. During a break in the meeting 
Kinkel said in Ioannina, Greece: "I am really not very 
optimistic that a solution can be found today or tomorrow." 
  However, Kinkel considers "movement" in the stalemated 
controversy possible. But he does not yet see prospects for a 
special Council of Ministers meeting next week to conclude an 
agreement. 
  The internal controversy of the Twelve, for the settlement 
of 
which the ministers started the fifth attempt this month on 
Saturday [26 March], is endangering the already decided 
accession of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway on 1 January 
1995. Says Kinkel: "It cannot and must not be that the 
accessions fail because of this issue." In the minister's view, 
the quarrel between Great Britain and Spain on the one hand and 
the other 10 countries on the other hurts the image of the 
European Union. 
  According to Greek and Spanish diplomats, "small steps of 
progress" were achieved on Saturday in the mediation efforts 
with London and Madrid -- both refuse an adjustment of the 
blocking minority in the extended Council of Ministers from 23 
to 27 votes. It is considered to basically stick to the 
adjustment to 27 votes for a blocking minority in the extended 
Council of Ministers. However, if there should be narrow 
decisions, the partners might commit themselves to looking for a 
mutually acceptable solution. 
  Kinkel said: "The core of a solution must be 27 votes." 
This is the only way in which the European Parliament, which 
also demands the adjustment of the blocking minority to 27 
votes, can agree to the enlargement treaties. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE/PHF: "Willy Claes: The European Union </F>
Has Avoided Loss of Credibility"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Istanbul 29 Mar (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes is very pleased at the United Kingdom's decision to 
accept the compromise submitted to the Twelve on Sunday [27 
March] by the Greek presidency of the European Union (EU) on the 
balance of votes within the enlarged Council of sixteen members. 
  "I am very pleased because we have been able to avoid at the 
very last minute what threatened to be a serious crisis which 
would have cost the EU much of its credibility," stressed Mr. 
Claes on Tuesday evening in Istanbul where he is completing an 
official two-day visit to Turkey. 
  The recantations of recent weeks suggest, however, that a 
difficult debate is likely at the 1996 intergovernmental 
conference on EU institutional reforms. 
  Mr. Claes nevertheless remains optimistic: "We showed on 
Sunday that we are able to provide satisfactory responses to 
very complex matters," he stated. 
  The Belgian foreign minister now wants to allow things to 
settle down and rejects the idea of quickly setting up a 
committee of wise men charged with clearing the way in 
preparation for 1996. 
  "We must not be too hasty. This committee should not start 
its activities until around mid-1995. It serves no purpose to 
immediately start a discussion between the different factions 
and therefore encumber the normal activities of the Community 
and the enlargement debates currently in progress with the four 
candidate countries," he added.

<F P=106> [Philip Stephens report: "Hurd Hits Out at Eurosceptics"] </F>
  [Text] Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, last night 
acted to roll back the recent tide of Euroscepticism in the 
Conservative party by strongly re-affirming the government's 
fundamental commitment to the European Union [EU]. 
  In a speech reasserting his own political authority in the 
cabinet, Mr Hurd publicly derided those who thought Britain 
could turn its back on Europe. 
  The comments contrasted sharply with the anti-Brussels 
remarks earlier this week of Mr John Major, the prime minister. 
Mr Hurd's speech to Tory activists at the party's spring 
conference in Plymouth, left the impression he was delivering an 
implicit warning to the prime minister not to cede ground to the 
party's right-wing Eurosceptics. Later in the day, the foreign 
secretary coupled his strong words with a clear signal that 
Britain could compromise on the voting issue as long as its 
European partners give ground. 
  As he flew to a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece 
last night, he said the dispute would sooner or later be 
resolved: "At the end of the day there is agreement. That's the 
way the Community works. That's the way it will work this time." 
  Mr Hurd's Plymouth speech appeared to deliver a thinly 
veiled 
rebuke to those in the cabinet who have turned the present votes 
row between Britain and its partners into a broader onslaught 
against the European Union. 
  The traditionally sceptical tone of right-wing cabinet 
ministers like Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley has more 
recently been echoed by similar sentiments from Mr Kenneth 
Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine -- both self-avowed 
pro-Europeans, but also potential successors to Mr Major in any 
leadership contest. 
  But the foreign secretary told party workers to call a halt 
to the "lunatic" discussion of whether they were pro or 
anti-European. Instead they had to grasp the central message: 
"The future of Britain rests in Europe." 
  Mr Hurd's untypically tough language in Plymouth appeared to 
reflect his growing frustration at the way in which the dispute 
over majority voting once the Union is enlarged next year has 
shifted the centre of gravity among Tory MPs towards the 
Eurosceptics. 
  He insisted he was as determined as anyone to fight for 
Britain's interests in Europe but the Conservatives must reject 
a "sour, defensive attitude which concentrates exclusively on 
the negative things about the European Union." 
  Speaking after his address, Mr Hurd said the cabinet had 
agreed on Thursday that it must fight a positive, pro-European 
campaign in the critical elections to the Strasbourg parliament 
on June 9. 
  Mr Major, who is to address the closing session of the 
Plymouth conference later today, is now expected to tone down 
attacks on Brussels. He will be joined on the platform by both 
Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke. 
  It also emerged yesterday that the cabinet agreed this week 
that all future ministerial pronouncements on Europe must in 
future be cleared through 10 Downing Street in order to minimise 
the appearance of divisions. 
  Mr Hurd told his colleagues on Thursday of the need to 
maintain a positive and consistent line if the Conservatives are 
not to suffer heavy losses in the June Euro-elections. 
  The foreign secretary offered a detailed assessment of the 
economic and security realities which meant that Britain could 
not detach itself from Europe. He concluded: "Unless we can 
lift our sights we shall put at risk Britain's position." 
  Mr Hurd stressed that this did not mean that Britain could 
not argue its case strongly in Europe.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Partnership and Cooperation </F>
Agreement With Ukraine Initialled"; as released by Brussels 
Textline database] 
  [Excerpt] Sir Leon Brittan and Hans van den Broek (for the 
European Commission), Ukraine Foreign Minister Mr. Zlenko and a 
representative of the Greek Council Presidency initialled the 
EC/Ukraine partnership and cooperation agreement on Wednesday 
[23 March] in Brussels. 
  Negotiations for the agreement were concluded last Friday. 
No date has been set yet for the signature, after which 
ratification procedures may begin in the twelve EU Member States 
and the Ukraine. External political relations Commissioner van 
den Broek told the press of the "extreme importance" the EU 
attaches to this agreement, not only because it enables the two 
parties to "institutionalize" and "intensify cooperation in many 
areas," but also because it is the first accord of this type 
concluded with one of the republics of the former USSR. Sir 
Leon Brittan, Commissioner for external economic relations, 
called it a "historic" event opening a new era in relations 
between the Union and Ukraine, notably because the partnership 
agreement establishes as an objective the creation "at some 
future date" of a free-trade area. "We will see if this is 
possible in 1998," said Sir Leon Brittan, adding that the 
"success of the agreement" will also depend on the progress and 
results of economic reforms underway in Ukraine. Despite myriad 
problems, this country "has not hesitated to pursue its reforms" 
and, of all the republics of the ex-Soviet Union, is today one 
of the most sound economically and politically. The agreement 
establishes facilities in a multitude of sectors: trade (Sir 
Leon mentioned steel, textiles and coal), investment, capital 
movements, copyright and so on, in the interest of both parties. 
The Commissioner also recalled that the accord contains a 
most-favoured-nation clause, under which the Union will treat 
Ukraine on an equal footing with its other GATT partners. Now 
that the accord exists, it will have to be implemented and given 
tangible effect, concluded the Commissioner. Ukraine Foreign 
Minister Mr. Zlenko (who spoke not only in his own language, but 
also in English and French) welcomed "this important step," 
saying it marks progress towards his country's future accession 
to the European Union, one of Ukraine's top priorities. "For 
the future, our dream and our goal is to join the European 
Union," insisted Mr. Zlenko (though Sir Leon noted that there is 
no reference to such a goal in the agreement). As to his 
country's reaction to the fact that, in the accord, Ukraine is 
not considered to be an economy in transition to a market 
economy (while the EU considers Russia to be a transition 
economy), the Minister commented that independently of the EU's 
assessment, "Ukraine is in a transitional period and it is 
unimportant whether this is stated or not. Reforms are underway 
for building a market economy and we will bring them to a 
successful conclusion," he said. Asked about the matter of the 
so-called referendum in Crimea (planned for next Sunday, but 
cancelled by the Ukraine government), Mr. Zlenko insisted on the 
"purely internal" nature of this matter and recalled that his 
government considers such a referendum unconstitutional. Hans 
van den Broek recalled, for his part, that respect for Ukraine's 
territorial integrity is an important principle for the European 
Union and has been incorporated into the agreement. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Gillian Tett in Brussels, Michael Lindemann in </F>
Bonn, and Andrew Baxter in London: "EU Steel Deal a Camouflage, 
Say Officials"] 
  [Text] They are too polite to use the fudge word. But as 
officials in Brussels yesterday digested this week's surprise 
agreement forged between steelmakers and Mr Martin Bangemann, EU 
[European Union] industry commissioner, the mood in some 
quarters was bitter. 
  Although Mr Bangemann's entourage insists it is delighted 
that the industry has apparently met the European Commission's 
demands for further steel reductions, in private officials admit 
the deal may have been little more than a face-saving camouflage. 
  "All that has happened is that the problem has been put off 
for another year or two nothing has really been agreed at all," 
commented one Commission official. 
  From the perspective of some member states, at least, such 
an 
analysis may seem too harsh. 
  Mr Bangemann's aides point out that his meeting on Wednesday 
[23 March] with chiefs of the big steel producers marked a 
significant shift in the negotiating climate. In place of the 
political posturing which has dogged recent negotiations, both 
sides are proclaiming a new climate of "understanding." This 
involves agreement to aim for cuts totalling some l9 million 
tonnes in capacity, in exchange for extending the deadline for a 
restructuring plan until November. 
  Furthermore, the steel industry's offer of a moratorium on 
state aid until November has been welcomed by the Commission and 
member states, particularly in the UK which has recently stepped 
up its demands that the Commission take a tougher line on state 
aid. But with the details of the plan remaining to be decided 
some Commission officials fear that the extension of the 
deadline will give the industry more scope to evade the cuts. 
  The steel market is expected to pick up in the summer, 
partly 
on the back of a recovery in the motor industry, so further cuts 
are likely to be even less palatable to the steel sector. These 
fears have been fuelled by continuing ambiguities in the new 
"understanding," including the source of the extra reductions. 
  Although the Commission says the final figure has been 
boosted by 6 million tonnes-worth of cuts in the Italian private 
sector and 2 million tonnes-worth through private sector 
mergers, most probably in Germany, in practice these figures 
appear to involve little more than a juggling of earlier offers. 
  There is also a question over the degree of industry support 
for the deal. 
  British Steel, one of the most hawkish of the private sector 
producers, reacted cautiously to the deal as it did not attend 
Wednesday's meeting. But it said anything which led to 
subsidies being ended permanently would be welcomed. 
  The German steel federation was pleased that talks about 
capacity cuts had been extended and that an ECU240 million 
(181.4 million pounds) aid package to help pay for redundancies 
had not been cancelled. "The industry needs this. It is not 
over the worst yet," it said. But German producers were not 
likely to make any extra capacity cuts.

<F P=106> [Report on article based on book by Sir Leon Brittan, EU </F>
Trade Commissioner, entitled "The Europe We Need"] 
  [Text] A strange paradox lies at the heart of the European 
Union [EU], a paradox that mirrors the ambivalence so many 
Europeans currently feel towards the rest of the continent. In 
times of crisis the Union is seen to have let its peoples down, 
notably by failing to act to stop the killing in Bosnia; at 
other times it is cast as a secretive, self-inflating 
bureaucracy bent on over-regulating the lives of its citizens 
just to keep its staff in business. It is at once too powerful 
and yet not powerful enough, a beast showing the strength of a 
bear and the timidity of a door-mouse, and both on the wrong 
occasions. 
  For many, Europe has temporarily lost its bearings. Recent 
history helps explain why: the painful reunification of Europe 
has collided with the deepest recession since the 1930s, leaving 
the shining emblems of a bold and prosperous Europe in the 1980s 
looking tarnished alongside the unemployment of the l990s. As 
the Danes rejected Maastricht and the money-changers gambled on 
France doing the same, it seemed the dominoes of Europe's 
delicate consensus in favour of integration were falling one by 
one. 
  Europe must rebuild the confidence shaken from it by recent 
history to face the tough decisions that history has now thrust 
upon it. The countries of Central and East Europe, fearful of 
backsliding in Russia, are knocking ever louder at the Union's 
door; the vexed question of monetary union is now resurfacing; 
Bosnia has exposed the need for a shared foreign and security 
policy but also the immense obstacles to achieving it; the 
interdependence of the world economy is calling on Europe to 
restore its industrial competitiveness, and seemingly 
unstoppable growth in Asia is telling it to do so fast. 
  If the Union is to confront these issues with unity and 
resolve, it needs to carry the people with it. This, above all, 
means putting the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in law for 
the first time in the Maastricht treaty -- to work. 
  Subsidiarity, properly practised, should defy the pro- and 
anti-federalists alike, for it means striking a balance between 
intervention and abstention, allowing decision-making to settle 
at the most appropriate level. It is not a static principle but 
one which should allow for the ebb and flow of responsibility 
between regional, national and European authorities, according 
to the need for Europeans to act alone or together at any moment. 
  If it is to stall excessive centralisation, the burden of 
proof must fall on those arguing for decisions to be taken by 
the Union itself, and the least restrictive instrument should be 
used. All legislation should be screened accordingly, and no 
powers should be set in stone -- indeed, there may be cases 
where national governments have acquired the expertise to 
perform the task hitherto allotted to the Union just as 
adequately, and the reins could then be handed back to them. 
Knowing when to stop will, therefore, be instrumental in 
restoring the Union's credibility. 
  But equally, the true application of the principle of 
subsidiarity means that, where acting together at European Union 
level enables something more desirable to be achieved more 
effectively, the Union should not hesitate to take the necessary 
action. Europe's collective achievements -- the creation of a 
unified market and effective single policies on competition and 
trade, for example -- should have proved to its detractors by 
now that team work at European level can enable each country to 
score more highly for itself than it could have done alone, 
however tiresome its team-mates may seem at times. Yet 
widespread distrust persists. The Union's duty, therefore, is 
not simply to accrue power when times are good and wash its 
hands of those responsibilities when times are bad: it is to 
assist governments in the search for the best level at which to 
take each decision, and draw ordinary people into that process. 
  To do that, the democratic element in the European Union 
must 
be reinforced. With 12 national parliaments and one European 
Parliament all empowered to scrutinise European laws, Europe has 
considerable means of democratic expression, but much of that 
potential is wasted. National parliaments seldom analyse 
European laws with the degree of scrutiny those laws deserve. 
They appear to exert little influence over their ministers when 
the latter meet at Union level to adopt new laws. Often 
national and European MPs are locked in opposition, one 
suspecting the other of tugging policy too far towards, or away 
from, the centre of Europe. 
  This need not be. For, if harnessed jointly to the 
decision-making wheel, they would complement each other. 
Through a Committee of Parliaments, national MPs could be 
assigned specific powers alongside their counterparts in the 
Strasbourg assembly, so reassuring voters that power over their 
lives is not ebbing abroad to bodies they did not elect. 
  The Committee of Parliaments could ensure power was 
exercised 
at the right level and on the right legal grounds: it could 
watch over subsidiarity, with the power to ask the European 
Court of Justice to adjudicate if necessary; ensure laws have 
the correct legal base (a common battleground among governments 
fearing the Union may be growing by stealth); and check when 
governments consider extending the Union,s authority. 
  Only if it realises its democratic potential can the Union 
face the greatest challenge: the drive to maintain efficiency as 
it takes in more countries. The Union,s decision-making 
machinery, which has hardly changed since the Community began, 
is already creaking under the weight of 12 countries. It will 
creak more loudly with 16, and grind to a halt if Europe 
enlarges thereafter. But to lock out Central and East European 
countries on these grounds is inexcusable. 
  Instead the inter-governmental conference that is to be 
held in 1996 should centre on the simple, but intractable 
question: how should we change the way the European Union is run 
to enable us to admit a substantial number of new countries 
without the Union grinding to a halt? This involves looking at 
how the Union's institutions work: the Commission and the 
Parliament, as well as the Council of Ministers and a fresh look 
at the voting questions which have caused such agonised debate. 
But we would also have to widen our analysis if the countries 
of East and Central Europe were to be absorbed into the Union in 
due course. 
  The collapse of communism is forcing a more sharply focused 
consideration of Union policy towards its Eastern neighbours. 
The question is no longer one merely of foreign policy -- it is 
central to the future of the Union itself. The loss of Soviet 
markets made East Europeans look west for business but the 
threat of Russian nationalism is sharpening their demand for 
membership of the European fold, in economic, political and 
security terms. 
  War in Europe, too, is forcing Nato to confront the need for 
its European members to develop a more autonomous security 
policy within the alliance, as Soviet might gives way to 
smaller, less easily identifiable security threats closer home. 
The old dichotomy between reinforcing the European pillar of 
Nato and maintaining the transatlantic link is withering away as 
the U.S. encourages Europe's autonomy within the Western 
European Union [WEU] and France begins to shed its staunchly 
independent view of defence. Developing a true European pole 
within Nato, but one also capable of acting outside it under the 
WEU, is now realistic and should be encouraged. 
  The European Union should also gradually lift its remaining 
barriers to trade from the East, while urging East Europe to 
adopt competition and other market rules similar to its own. 
Yesterday those countries needed aid and advice on how to build 
a market economy; today they also need investment and the 
infrastructure and economic stability to attract it as painful 
reforms take root. The West's role must also be made more 
visible, to help prevent people turning their back on those 
reforms. Ultimately it is economic prosperity that will weld the 
continent together, leading to a joint political future in one 
Union, each country in its own time. 
  Prosperity is also the most effective agent of integration 
in 
West Europe -- a lesson apparent from the lack of support for 
European integration as the recession and unemployment bite. 
The Union will sink or swim on its ability to restore the 
competitiveness of its economy. Through its role as "steward" 
of Europe, the Union must establish order among a series of 
often competing priorities -- for example, the protection of 
Europe's rural communities while encouraging agriculture to 
compete without excessive subsidies; or the creation of a social 
safety net which does not stifle industry; or the need to close 
the wealth gap by bringing poor countries up to richer ones, and 
not vice versa. Any attempt to muddle through -- merely to 
"manage" these issues rather than to introduce real reform where 
necessary will not work. The reason is that one priority 
thwarts all others: the need to compete on world markets. 
  Only a detailed and dispassionate analysis of Europe's 
economic woes can find a common cure. This process has begun 
with the Commission's white paper on Growth, Competitiveness and 
Employment. It is clear the Union must pursue existing policies 
with renewed vigour, for example by completing the single 
market; loosening the grip that monopolies still hold over 
Europe's transport, energy and communications networks, while 
channelling private capital more smoothly into those networks; 
and ensuring that we and our competitors abide by the stringent 
new trade rules agreed in the Uruguay Round. We also need 
improved research to turn good ideas into market-beating 
exports; to encourage the growth of small companies and 
entrepreneurship; to reduce state subsidies to ailing 
enterprises; and to ensure more efficient spending of the Union 
budget, not just by quashing fraud but also by shifting staff 
more quickly to confront new challenges. 
  Of the cures, two of the most potent are also among the most 
controversial. First Europe has to improve the versatility of 
its workforce. This does not mean neglecting health and safety, 
or hiring and firing for short-term gain; rather, it means 
removing rigidities which discourage employers from creating 
jobs, and correcting the mismatch between the skills people 
learn and those they require for the posts available. The Union 
itself can remove barriers to workers seeking jobs abroad; 
provide "marriage guidance" for industries looking for the most 
suitable training schemes in Europe; and help distill 
conflicting national views on social policy into common 
principles upon which European industry can rely, not through 
coercion but through debate. This will help governments shift 
their focus away from merely protecting old industries towards 
propagating new ones. 
  Secondly, the European currency crisis has not destroyed the 
Continental consensus in favour of a single currency, although 
it has shifted the debate over how to achieve it and by when. 
Far from exploiting their monetary freedom after the crisis, 
most EU countries have followed fiscal and monetary policies 
consistent with the approach laid down in Maastricht. In fact 
they have not used the greater freedom given to them by the 
wider band in the revised ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism]. It 
might be however, that the best way of achieving EMU [European 
Monetary Union] would be to seek agreement on a trans-Union 
non-inflationary monetary target, and for each country to be 
able to lower interest rates provided this would not risk 
breaching that target. This might mean more rapid emergence 
from recession and a pattern of exchange rates based on economic 
fundamentals which could, in due course, provide the basis for a 
single currency. That goal seems to me to be as valid and as 
attainable as ever, even if by slightly different means. 
  It is ironic that people are most tempted to spurn the 
European Union when their countries, need for it is greatest. 
Grafting a split continent back together is no mean feat, 
particularly when it forces radical change to the structure of 
the European house and brings fresh competition to an economy 
grappling with recession. The overarching aim must be to 
achieve that unity while assuring Europe's place in an ever more 
competitive world. It can only be done by a Union that is 
democratic, transparent and restrained enough in its actions to 
be confident and deserving of the public support it needs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU/Russia: No Progress on </F>
Cooperation Pact; Talks Set To Go on Until April"; as released 
by Brussels MULTINATIONAL SERVICE in English] 
  [Text] Talks between the European Union and Russia look 
likely to drag on even further into this year despite hopes that 
the proposed Partnership and Cooperation and Agreement between 
the European Union [EU] and Russia would be concluded in the 
first weeks of 1994. Stuck on the two controversial issues of 
trade in nuclear materials and foreign banking access in Russia, 
negotiations have scarcely progressed since December. 
  Although both sides had been confident that the Agreement 
could be successfully concluded before the visit of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to Brussels on December 9, it emerged 
that significant problems remained with trade in nuclear fuel 
and the Russian banking sector. Since then, experts from both 
sides have attempted to tackle the core of these issues but to 
no avail. One Russian diplomatic source was very pessimistic 
for the future of the talks, arguing that it was unlikely that 
agreement would be reached before the end of March, threatening 
a further extension of negotiations into April. 
<H5>  Trade in Nuclear Fuel </H5>
  The problems surrounding trade in nuclear materials between 
Russia and the EU countries focus on a draft separate agreement 
negotiated at an earlier date with the Russians in the framework 
of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). This draft 
agreement has been rejected by the Russians who want trade in 
nuclear products integrated into the Partnership and Cooperation 
Agreement. The Europeans argue that it is crucial to maintain 
specific regimes on price levels and traded volumes, etc., in 
the nuclear domain and, as such, the issue must be resolved 
within a EURATOM accord. In response, the Russians produced new 
proposals at the end of January outlining their plans for 
integrating nuclear trade into the Partnership Agreement. The 
Commission rejected several of the ideas as unclear and 
contradictory, but is still examining them. Nevertheless, 
according to one Commission source, it is "highly unlikely" to 
give a positive response. 
<H5>  Banking Block </H5>
  The other stumbling block concerns the controversy over 
foreign banking facilities. In recent weeks, the Russians have 
limited the possibilities for foreign banks to operate in their 
territory, while a tentative agreement on the level of activity 
of European banks in Russia had already been reached. 
Nevertheless, the new law considerably limits the activities of 
foreign banks operating in Russia by restricting their 
activities to transactions with nonresidents only. Even this 
means of operating will only be allowed to continue until 
January 1996. Moreover, only those banks with existing links 
with Russian residents before November 15, 1993 will be allowed 
to stay in business. 
  The European Union, for its part, is prepared to limit 
foreign banking activity in Russia, but on the basis of other, 
less demanding, conditions. It is prepared to prevent the 
establishment of any new branches of foreign banks on Russian 
territory and to limit deposits to those over ECU100,000 which 
would concentrate foreign bank activity on large-scale 
enterprises. Furthermore, the EU would outlaw transactions on 
privatisation shares and Russian bonds while granting a licence 
to those foreign banks already established in Russia to allow 
them to continue operating.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Sir Leon Brittan, EU Trade </F>
Commissioner, by John Palmer in Brussels; date not given] 
  [Text] These are not the happiest of times for a former 
British Conservative minister to stand for the most prestigious 
job in the European Union [EU] -- the presidency of the European 
Commission. 
  Due in large measure to the bitter and protracted row over 
voting rights, British stock in the EU is probably as low now as 
ever it was during the darkest and most bruising period of 
Margaret Thatcher's Euro-confrontations. 
  Sir Leon Brittan, former home secretary and industry 
minister, and for the past six years a senior member of the 
commission is, nevertheless, the only candidate thus far to have 
revealed himself in the race to succeed Jacques Delors. 
Admirers and critics alike agree that Mr Delors, who retires in 
December after a remarkable decade at the helm of the EU, is a 
very hard act to follow. 
  A naturally reserved man, Sir Leon has developed a taste for 
the media spotlight since commg to Brussels. As commissioner 
responsible first for competition policy (including such highly 
charged issues as the British government "sweeteners" paid to 
Rover), and now for external trade, Sir Leon has not lacked 
publicity. 
  He is the co-architect of the Uraguay round of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreement, with the American 
negotiator Mickey Kantor, and Peter Sutherland, GATT's director 
general. 
  Sir Leon's colleagues sometimes find him aloof, but he is 
widely admired as the most formidable intellectual foil in the 
commission to Mr Delors, a Christian Socialist. 
  They have had their clashes, but Mr Delors has learnt to 
respect him. 
  To date, Sir Leon appears to have the public endorsement 
only 
of Britain. The most important power brokers who will decide on 
the next president (notably Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President 
Francois Mitterrand) appear to favour other candidates -- 
including the prime minister of Belgium Jean-Luc Dehaene and the 
Dutch prime minister, Ruud Lubbers. 
  So have the bitter exchanges between London and the other EU 
capitals over the delay on enlargement and new voting rights in 
the council of ministers fatally damaged his chances? 
  He is quick to put some daylight between himself and former 
cabinet colleagues. "I really do not know. It depends how long 
it goes on for. I am a British Conservative but I do not agree 
with the Conservative government on all questions." 
  Aware that anything he says on the arcane voting issue might 
add to the Tory civil war over Europe, Sir Leon will not be 
drawn on the negotiations. But he insists that the admission of 
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden should be Britain's 
priority, which can be loosely translated as: "For Gods sake, 
put this blocking minority stuff in context or take the blame if 
enlargement is derailed." 
  It would be unfair if Sir Leon were seen in other capitals 
as 
no more than a stalking horse for Perfidious Albion's strategy 
to reverse European integration. 
  His thinking has evolved since he came to Brussels and his 
manifesto for the the EU set out in his book, Europe -- The 
Europe We Need, published this week, points to a rather 
different European future than current Tory orthodoxy. 
  The book shows that Sir Leon is now a convinced 
integrationist. His final chapter on the future of EU 
institutions puts him on the side of those who want the union to 
"deepen" as well as "widen". 
  In a much larger EU (progressively opening to the east) he 
wants to make it easier for at least some decisions in areas 
such as the internal market, health and safety at work, farm 
fisheries and trade policy to be taken by a majority vote. 
  Hardly surprising in a Tory, he wants it slightly less easy 
to take majority decisions in subjects "touching the individual 
citizen", such as social and environmental policy. 
  Sir Leon is an unapologetic advocate of monetary union and a 
single currency, and is increasingly optimistic these will be 
achieved in the time scale agreed in the Maastricht Treaty. 
  What have been the biggest surprises during his time in 
Brussels? 
  "I think what has surprised me most is the sheer resilience 
of the European process," he said. "When we run into problems 
we pick ourselves up and continue with remarkable speed." 
  He gives the impression of a man who feels the powerful 
forces still pushing the integration bandwagon forward. 
  Surely the contrast between a British cabinet and a 
multi-national, multi-lingual commission must be enormous? 
  "The differences are not anything like as great as you might 
think. Commissioners do have somewhat greater personal 
political autonomy than a cabinet minister -- you do not have to 
clear things with the top as you might in a cabinet." 
  Sir Leon concedes there are limits. "If you were to make a 
series of speeches attacking commission policy on the 
environment, for example, that might not go down well with your 
colleagues. And one does also gets involved in some trade-offs 
with ones fellow commissioners sometimes to get policies 
through." 
  So he acknowledges he has changed -- perhaps even "gone 
native" in Brussels? 
  Sir Leon will have none of it. "That is a ridiculous 
expression. Of course the world has changed in the last few 
years and that means that I have developed my views -- rather 
than changed my mind on fundamentals. The enormous changes in 
Central and East Europe are a case in point." 
  He wants to close the gulf between the EU institutions and 
public opinion, and to see national parliaments more involved -- 
alongside the European parliament -- in the governance of the EU. 
  He would also like a smaller, but politically more 
effective commission -- a message which might not appeal to some 
smaller EU countries. The commission's "reputation for 
over-weening bureaucracy is greatly exaggerated but it may not 
be wholy unjustified". 
  But with Europe still to be made, his main message is to 
fellow Tories. "There is no shortage of opportunities. Let us 
seize them with both hands."

<F P=106> [Daniel Green report: "Germany Forecast To Hamper EU </F>
Recovery"] 
  [Text] German economic "stagnation" will hold back 
recovery across Europe, according to a report published today by 
Barclays Bank of the UK. 
  Bonn's problems in the financing of eastern Germany, and a 
continuing fall in industrial competitiveness, mean that real 
gross national product growth in the European Union [EU] this 
year will reach only 1.6 per cent, compared with an estimated 
fall of 0.3 per cent in 1993, the bank believes. 
  German recovery will be "late, partly because the Bundesbank 
has adopted a cautious approach to reducing interest rates," 
says its report. 
  By 1995, GNP growth in the EU will be 2.5 per cent "but this 
is no more than a return to trend." 
  The importance of Germany to the health of Europe's economy 
is, if anything, increasing. "In the past it has been difficult 
for Europe to stage a robust upswing without Germany," writes 
the report's author, Mr Nigel Newman, Barclays' senior European 
economist. 
  "During the past 10 years Germany and the rest of Europe 
have 
become more closely integrated. Faced with a (slow recovery) in 
Germany, the prospects for the rest of Europe do not look 
particularly promising." 
  The result will be a "modest and probably erratic period of 
recovery" this year. 
  The state of the German economy is compounded by high 
interest rates, low confidence, falling employment and 
"restrictive" tax policies which will continue to hurt demand 
from European consumers. 
  Rises in long-term interest rates seen this month could also 
hinder recovery unless reversed. 
  The prospects for France, where a "sluggish recovery" is 
under way, are seen as slightly better than for Germany. But 
the French trade balance could deteriorate as a result of 
falling industrial competitiveness as the franc remains tied to 
the D-Mark [German mark] in the European monetary system. 
  Italy's improving competitiveness and exports should mean a 
significant recovery this year. "Export growth is leading the 
upswing, although an end to destocking will also provide 
support," says the report. 
  Rising exports should also assist Spain, with higher 
consumer 
spending helping. 
  The forecasts for the UK are optimistic, saying that 
consumer 
spending will continue to grow in spite of higher taxes next 
month. Across the EU, the outlook for interest and inflation 
rates is viewed by the bank as more promising than for growth. 
  Inflation will stay just below 1993's 3.4 per cent for the 
next three years, says the report, while interest rates are 
forecast to slip from 7.9 per cent in 1993 to 5.2 per cent in 
1994 and 4.5 per cent for the subsequent two years. 
  The scheduled widening of EU membership next January 1 -- 
with the possible arrival as full members of Sweden, Austria, 
Norway and Finland -- will increase the size of the EU by 7 per 
cent in terms of gross domestic product. 
  This "should give intra-EU trade a one-off boost in 1994 and 
1995," says the report.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/P/94/22: "Commission To Create a </F>
European Science and Technology Assembly"] 
  [Text] On Commissioner Antonio Ruberti's initiative, the 
Commission has decided to create a "European Science and 
Technology Assembly." Following the example of the U.S. 
"National Research Council" or the Japanese "Japan Research 
Council," this consultative and advisory body is to assist the 
Commission in designing and implementing the Community's 
research and development policy in the field of technology. 
  Professor Ruberti underlined that "the Community can only be 
successful in the science and technology sector if it fully 
takes the versatility of European research into account for 
designing and assessing its actions. This new tool will make it 
possible." 
  The "European Science and Technology Assembly" will include 
approximately 100 high-level officials appointed on the basis of 
proposals from the various organizations involved in science and 
technology on the European level. 
  The creation of the Assembly had been announced by the 
Commission in the "White Book on Growth, Competitiveness, and 
Employment." Indeed, by establishing a direct, close, and 
permanent contact between the Commission on the one hand and the 
European scientific community and industrial world on the other 
hand, the Assembly will ensure that the Community's research and 
development activities have the expected positive impact on the 
European economy and society. 
  Technological research and development call for a growing 
part of the Community's financial resources. The activities 
carried out in the sector have considerable effects on the 
economic activity and the life of citizens. With the very high 
level of expertise of its members, the Assembly will be able to 
guarantee: 

  -  the relevance of the choices made in the field 
of science and technology; 
  -  the quality of research; 
  -  that the 
most recent developments in the field of technology as well as 
the needs of the economy and the society are taken into account. 
  The Commission will systematically request the opinion of 
the 
Assembly on a certain number of issues: the scientific and 
technological contents of the Community's research programs, the 
criteria and the methods for assessing proposals, etc. On its 
own initiative, the assembly can also prepare reports and give 
opinions on the various aspects of the Community's research 
policy or the development of science and technology in Europe 
and elsewhere.

<F P=106> [Article by Alfredo Venturi: "Shaky Axis Between Paris and </F>
Bonn"] 
  [Text] Bonn--Is it, or is it not true that during the 
unnerving negotiations for the inclusion of Norway in the EU 
[European Union], German Minister Klaus Kinkel verbally abused 
his Spanish colleague, Javier Solana? Is it, or is it not true 
that Bonn's chief diplomat went so far as to use such 
undiplomatic expressions as "We will break your back?" Whether 
it's true or not, the fact is that Kinkel's strong intervention 
to force Madrid to remove its paralyzing reservations to 
Norway's inclusion, thus creating the image of Germany as the 
leading power of the European Union, provoked French 
resentments, and as a consequence a small crisis in 
French-German relations. Yesterday, Francois Scheer, French 
ambassador to Germany, was called to the Foreign Ministry: an 
absolutely unusual step among allied countries and especially 
among friendly countries. 
  This was a step which was preceded on Wednesday [17 March] 
by 
a front-page article in the influential FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. 
The article talked about the "diffidence" which is taking hold 
in Paris against the "enlarged German neighbor." The article 
quoted a French source who the day before had given voice to 
this diffidence in Bonn. According to that source, the noted 
incident of the lack of an invitation to Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
to attend the 50-year anniversary celebration of the Allied 
landing in Omaha Beach, is to be connected to a much more 
general problem: the problem of the foreign policy of the 
unified Germany. The French maintain that the German position 
on the EU's enlargement, first towards the North and then 
towards the East, its intense relations with Russia, and even 
the relocation of the government's headquarters to Berlin, are 
choices that require clarification. It is necessary that Bonn 
confirm its Western orientation. For this reason, which is of 
great importance, bilateral consultations must be intensified. 
  The French source was none other than Ambassador Scheer, and 
the occasion for his outburst was an informal chat with a group 
of German journalists. The chat was so informal as to allow the 
diplomat to express criticism of Kinkel's "personal style," and 
even to underscore the good image Rudolf Scharping, leader of 
the opposition and Kohl's adversary in the race to the 
Chancellery, enjoys in Paris and especially with President 
Mitterrand. In short, there was enough to infuriate Kinkel, who 
reacted by calling in Scheer. 
  Now there is an effort to recast the issue. Nevertheless, 
there remains the sensation of a deep malaise in relations 
between Paris and Bonn which is tied to a changed reality. It 
is evident that reunification, which altered the balance of 
power between the two countries in favor of the German giant, 
has compromised the equilibrium of the Franco-German axis. In 
this situation it would be desirable for the Bonn 
representatives to pay more attention to their style, resisting 
the temptation to pound their fists on the table. On the other 
hand, one must be realistic. As a diplomat who was present at 
the negotiating marathon said in Kinkel's defense, it was 
necessary to pressure the Spaniards so that they would unblock 
the accord with Norway, and who better to do that if not the 
Germans?

<F P=106> [Article by Ko Colijn and Paul Rusman: "Netherlands Army Is </F>
Going To Provide Egypt With Hundreds of Armored Vehicles"] 
  [Text] Pakistan is a problem, but Egypt is all right these 
days. In the past, that is to say about 10 years ago, the export 
of military goods to countries in the Middle East would have met 
with insurmountable problems. This changed somewhat following 
the Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement (Camp David). 
Minesweepers were allowed to demonstrate their abilities in 
Alexandria, top military personnel and secretaries of state (Van 
Houwelingen in 1985) cautiously tested the market during sneaky 
trips to the Nile. No real weapons were involved: after all, 
electronics, patrol ships and fishing for mines in the Red Sea 
did serve the general interest. In 1988, the Royal Navy also 
made a call in Egypt to once again demonstrate the quality of 
the Netherlands bottoms. But Egypt did not have any money. In 
thanks for services rendered during the Gulf war, it received 
generous military assistance from the United States so that it 
did not have to put its scarce resources into Netherlands goods. 
But now a small breakthrough is in the offing. It concerns real 
weapons, and the supplier is once again the Netherlands 
Government itself. The disarmament race in Europe has led to 
an enormous surplus of weapons. Minister Ter Beek has 727 
armored infantry vehicles, model YPR-765, for sale. The oldest 
are only 20 years old, the youngest were made in 1987. Now Egypt 
would like to acquire as many as 500 to 600 of them. According 
to the ministry's sales brochure, they should yield between 
400,000 and 700,000 guilders each, hence a total of something 
like 250 million guilders. According to reports, Pakistan had 
also expressed interest, but the idea of Daf armored vehicles on 
the front line against India was going a bit too far. Even 
though a war between Egypt and Israel is really no longer a 
matter of consideration, the planned sale to Egypt is not 
uncontroversial. First of all, the possibility of an "Iranian" 
development in Egypt, where fundamentalists and the government 
are fighting hard, is not excluded. To deliver to Egypt means 
more or less lengthy military relations with that country 
(maintenance, reserve parts), unless the United States is 
willing to provide the follow up care (even during crises). The 
willingness to enter into military ties with Egypt shows that 
the arms export policy of the Netherlands is in the process of 
changing. Evenhandedness requires that Israel no longer be an 
undesirable destination either. Before you know it, we will have 
moved from a quasiembargo of the Middle East as a "sensitive 
region" into a policy that comes down to calling yourself 
neutral as long as you supply all countries with equal amounts. 
Countries such as Iran and Iraq excluded, of course. The 
pressure to export becomes even greater because the defense 
budget takes income from future exports into account. Now that a 
large part of the discontinued equipment is bad, produces little 
return, and meanwhile is rusting away, the Ministry of Defense 
cannot afford to miss another major hit in the Middle East.

<F P=106> [Article by Ko Colijn and Paul Rusman: "Germany Refuses </F>
Turkey Artillery Shells--Netherlands Supplies Turkey With an 
Artillery Shell Factory"] 
  [Text] The Netherlands has the reputation of being 
relatively well-behaved as an arms exporting country. At least 
until now. Because of the affair surrounding Eurometal, this 
reputation has been somewhat damaged. Because the artillery 
shells supplied to Turkey by this company are suitable "against 
soft and hard targets." And the latter means human flesh. 
  More striking power for less money. That is the idea behind 
the plan to produce weapons jointly within NATO. One of these 
plans involved a joint Netherlands-British-Turkish artillery 
shell factory. This is advantageous, thanks to the reduced 
wage costs in Ankara, but sensitive, because of the ever greater 
grimness of the war violence perpetrated by the Turkish Army 
against the Kurds in the southeast. 
  In spite of that, in the late 1980's the Netherlands 
Government did make a choice in favor of this cooperation. NATO 
even considered the transfer of the ammunition production to 
their southern allies as a kind of development assistance 
because it involved industrializing countries. 
  The Netherlands partners included, among others, 
Philips, which helped the Turkish Aselsan plant 
develop its own production line for military communication. And 
Daf was involved in the production of Turkish armored 
vehicles. 
  In exchange, when the Netherlands purchased rocket launchers 
in America in 1987, the then-Secretary of State Van Houwelingen 
tried to bargain for participation by Netherlands arms 
manufacturers in Turkish-American projects. 
  Since 1980, the United States has given Eurometal 
an exclusive license to manufacture artillery shells for M-483 
model Howitzers, and to this effect a cooperation agreement was 
concluded with British and Turkish companies. This project was 
fully supported by the authorities involved. 
  Since 1987, the Netherlands Government has even held 
negotiations with Eurometal in the name of the British and the 
Turkish Governments about the production of the artillery shells. 
  Yet, until now this had really been only a 
British-Netherlands business with a slight German coloring; the 
shell casings came from the Netherlands, other parts from 
England, and the assembly took place at the German branch of 
Eurometal in Liebenau. But it was agreed that as of 1993 this 
assembly would take place in Turkey. 
  There were only two problems: until that time, the Turks had 
to continue purchasing their artillery shells from Eurometal (in 
Germany). And the assembly line of the Turkish company in 
Kirikkale had to be set up with the help of Netherlands 
personnel. No export license is required for the latter, at 
least as long as it remains limited to verbal support. It is 
hard to believe that not a single piece of paper or photocopy 
was involved, but a year and a half ago, in response to 
questions raised in parliament, Minister Van den Broek stated 
diplomatically that "no permit had been granted, however," for 
the concrete transfer of technology. But the German Government 
did not dare to grant an export license for the artillery shells 
coming off the assembly line in Liebenau, even though the main 
contractor, Eurometal, had committed itself through contract to 
supply a first 18,000-unit shipment to Turkey. 
  The Bundessicherheitsrat, which includes the 
chancellor and the Ministers of Internal, Foreign, and Economic 
Affairs and of Defense, prohibited the export. Meanwhile, it 
appeared from a German television broadcast (on 23 November 
1992) that the majority of the 18,000 artillery shells were 
already completed in Liebenau. The shipment was to take place 
before Christmas. 
  During the week before Christmas, while Germany continued to 
say "no," Van den Broek did grant Eurometal ("after careful 
checking of the applicable criteria") an export license for the 
shell casings related to the Turkish shipment. Apparently the 
equipment standardization within NATO had progressed further 
than the policy standardization between the Netherlands and 
Germany. 
  For a while, the matter ended up in an impasse. 
  A year ago, Van den Broek's successor, Kooijmans, claimed in 
the Second Chamber that the assembly of the 18,000 artillery 
shells in Liebenau had not taken place and that hence there had 
been no export to Turkey. 
  The German Government continued to refuse the delivery and 
that was painful for the Netherlands, because it apparently did 
not have matters in its own hands in terms of its cooperation 
projects within the context of NATO. It was also annoying for 
Eurometal because it could not meet its commitment to the Turks. 
  The only thing Eurometal could do was to ask the Turks for 
understanding, to close the assembly line in Liebenau as soon as 
possible and to ship it (via the Netherlands) to Istanbul. 
Then the problems could be solved as soon as possible in 
Turkey itself. 
  The Germans also asked the Turks for understanding and 
admitted that it might be possible to find a way out, if only to 
save less eye-catching German-Turkish contracts. 
  According to a spokesperson for Eurometal, the 18,000 
artillery shells completed in Germany will return to the 
Netherlands. In order not to make the matter too sensitive, 
Minister of Defense Rulus ter Beek will probably purchase the 
shipment. Because as soon as the Netherlands engineers in Turkey 
are ready, the Turks will be able to manufacture their artillery 
shells (a total of 206,000) themselves. Although with parts from 
the Netherlands and England. 
  The closing of the production line in Liebenau did not do 
Eurometal in Germany any good . The Landesregierung 
of Lower-Saxony (a coalition of Greens and the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany]) and the opposition (CDU-FDP 
[Christian Democratic Union-Free Democratic Party]) are both 
furious, albeit for different reasons. The Left feels that it is 
incredible that the German Government's refusal to allow the 
export of the artillery shells is being circumvented by and via 
the Netherlands. The statement was made in the 
Bundesrat (the German First Chamber) that by granting 
a permit to export the factory to "the Netherlands," Minister of 
Economic Affairs Guenter Rexrodt is waging war against the 
Kurdish people. Rexrodt's ministry initially defended itself 
by stating that nothing was known about the actual final 
destination: the Netherlands was the culprit. But the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs in the Hague does not accept this charge. 
It has a copy of the permit application made by Eurometal, 
which shows that the Germans knew that the Netherlands was only 
an intermediary stopping point. And it is making this known. 
Furthermore, the transaction "came up" at the ministerial level, 
although it was agreed not to make this matter public. The level 
of pain had to be kept low, but given the veiled accusations 
this did not quite succeed. "We are curious to see how the 
German Government will react to our response," was the reserved 
comment made by one diplomat. 
  An insider in the Hague blames the German behavior primarily 
on domestic pressure rather than ethical purity. Reference was 
made to a German-Turkish cooperation project whereby Germany is 
helping Turkey with the modernization of old 155mm Howitzers. 
Following modernization, the guns are particularly well suited 
for the M-483 artillery shells. Incidentally, two years ago the 
Germans offered this kind of artillery shell to the Turks. 
  The words unfair competition are even mentioned: 
it was not due to moral correctness that the Germans were not 
cooperating with the artillery shell exports, but because they 
would have preferred to see their own Rheinmetal 
rather than the Netherlands Eurometal export the artillery 
shells. The much less famous German-Turkish Howitzer project is 
still on track, but the artillery shells have been politicized 
to such an extent that not a single individual wants to continue 
burning his fingers on them. The CDU-FDP opposition also sees it 
this way and they are furious because the hypocrisy of the 
German Government is providing money to the Netherlands and 
costing jobs in Liebenau. 
  Based on the responses given by Minister Kooijmans in the 
Second Chamber there also appears to be something strange. Up to 
now he, as well as his predecessor Van den Broek, had always 
talked about setting up a final assembly line in Turkey. What 
was meant was a line like the one which up to now existed in 
Liebenau. But Turkey will receive two assembly lines. The 
Liebenau line is intended for the assembly of components, and 
now, according to the Netherlands Government, the final assembly 
line is to come from the Netherlands. On this subject, Eurometal 
refuses to "make any comment." 
  But it is enough to know that Minister Van den Broek did not 
provide correct information to parliament on 12 October 1992. 
  It is a fact that the reputation of the Netherlands as a 
relatively well behaved arms exporting country has been somewhat 
damaged by the affair. When even the 
Bundessicherheitsrat feels that the artillery shells 
and heavy artillery could be used in the struggle against the 
Kurds, it is a little strange that the Netherlands considers 
this "less probable, given the condition of the relevant 
terrain." After Sarajevo, they really ought to know better here. 
  Eurometal itself has not operated skillfully either. Even 
the respectable DIE ZEIT has noted that the company, of which 
the Netherlands is still a major shareholder, has placed 
advertisements in the Turkish defense press for these artillery 
shells, which are so suitable "against hard and soft tar 
gets." The latter words do not refer to tanks but to human 
flesh. 
  "You obviously mean the Kurds," company spokesperson Weenink 
responded helpfully when asked about this. "Those artillery 
shells are far too good for that."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams by </F>
Nicholas Watt in Belfast; date not given] 
  [Text] Gerry Adams gave a warning yesterday that 
Republicans will reject the Downing Street declaration and will 
develop their own peace initiative if the Government refuses to 
clarify last December's agreement. 
  In an interview with THE TIMES in west Belfast, the Sinn 
Fein 
president said Sinn Fein could not wait indefinitely for the 
Government to meet its demands. But he described December's 
Anglo-Irish declaration as a significant development which he 
hoped to incorporate into a wider peace process. 
  Mr Adams, who was interviewed at Sinn Fein's office on the 
Falls Road in west Belfast, called on the Government to clarify 
the document in the way that it has for other parties. But he 
warned: "At some point of course we may exhaust that possibility 
and we may have to conclude reluctantly that because of Mr 
Major's leadership difficulties that he won't be able to engage 
with us. Then I think we will perhaps have to try to find other 
ways of moving forward." This would mean turning back to the 
agreement Mr Adams reached last year with John Hume, the leader 
of the SDLP. 
  "We cannot allow the peace process to founder," Mr Adams 
said. "The lesson is that this peace process arose from the 
Irish initiatives. One would move back to that." 
  Mr Adams, who was wearing the kind of smart suit which 
helped 
him to woo the American media during his trip to New York last 
month, said that he was perplexed by the Government's attitude 
to the peace process during the past few months. He said: "They 
seem to have stopped petrified in mid-leap. We are keen to 
explore whether the Downing Street declaration is a tremendous 
leap or whether it is a barricade the British Government has 
erected almost as a counter-offensive to the pressure coming 
from Ireland." 
  Since John Major and Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime 
minister, issued the Downing Street declaration last December, 
Mr Adams and other leading Republicans have been careful neither 
to accept nor reject the document. Mr Adams said yesterday that 
while Sinn Fein was encouraged by the peace process it was 
unhappy with the Unionist veto in the declaration and its 
assertion that Irish self-determination should be exercised 
separately on both sides of the border. 
  "It is perfectly reasonable to say that we want London and 
Dublin to come to an agreement which involves all of us, and 
then as part of that to seek Unionist consent. But I think what 
is turning that on its head is to say that we cannot move unless 
we have Unionist consent." 
  That would be akin, he said, to President de Klerk of South 
Africa refusing to agree to reforms without the consent of the 
far right. 
  "Why should John Major stall on the basis of right-wing 
reaction in Ireland?" Mr Adams said. Unionists should be 
persuaded that their future lay in a united Ireland. "Why 
doesn't he try to move these people forward. I actually have 
confidence in the Unionists that in the new scenario they will 
be pragmatic and that they will seek to work out the best 
arrangement for themselves." 
  Mr Adams said that Britain had no right to interfere in 
Irish 
self-determination, and Sinn Fein would continue to boycott any 
border polls to decide the future of Northern Ireland. But he 
added: "It's remarkable that the British Government has taken 
all these hundreds of years to admit that the people of Ireland 
are a nation."

  [Text] Tirana, March 28 (ATA) -- The president of the 
Republic of Albania, Sali Berisha, who is on an official visit 
to London since March 27, met today with Mr. Douglas Hogg, 
minister of state for foreign and Commonwealth affairs, an 
Albanian TV journalist reports from London. The topic of the 
talks was the intensification of bilateral relations between 
Albania and Great Britain and cooperation in the economic field. 
They also discussed the aid that Great Britain may provide to 
Albania in various fields and its support and integration in the 
European structures. 
  Regarding the regional question, President Berisha said that 
"the Albanian question is still a sharp regional problem, whose 
resolution is directly linked with the stability in the Balkans. 
This issue calls for general solutions and it should be on the 
agenda along other international problems." Mr. Berisha 
reiterated that the lifting of the embargo against Serbia must 
be conditioned with the resolution of the Kosova question, the 
establishing of Kosova under the UN forces' control and the 
completion of an agreement on the status of Kosova. 
  Appreciating the so far achievements in Albania, Douglas 
Hogg 
expressed the conviction that there are possibilities for 
cooperation in fields of common interest such as in trade, 
tourism, and other fields. As regards the Kosova question, Mr. 
Hogg said that this issue needs an urgent solution. "We are for 
a policy which aims at granting autonomy to Kosova," Mr. Hogg 
said. 
  In the meeting with Baroness Chalker, minister of 
development 
with overseas countries, the talk focused on the realisation of 
the projects which are under way and the possibilities for the 
expansion of these projects and commissioning of new ones in the 
future. After appreciating the aid of the British Government and 
non-government humanitarian organizations, Mr. Berisha pointed 
out the support that Britain may render to Albania in the 
reorganization of the banking system, in infrastructure, glass 
industry and culture. 
  Mr. Berisha met with a group of representatives of the 
"Premje" Oil company, which is now having negotiations with 
Albpetrol. The group appreciated the cooperation and expressed 
their commitment to start their activity in Albania as soon as 
possible. In the meeting that President Berisha had with a BBC 
group, they discussed possibilities for cooperation in various 
fields of common interest. 
  In the afternoon of March 28, President Berisha met with the 
British premier, John Major. Mr. Major said he will encourage 
British investments in Albania and expressed his readiness to 
support Albania's integration into European institutions, in the 
European Union, the Western European Union, adding that he will 
make his contribution to include Albania in the associate 
agreement. Mr. Major also offered his support for the 
membership of the Albanian Democratic Party in the European 
Democratic Union. 
  The meeting also focused on the situation in the region. 
President Berisha presented the Albanian question. "This 
issue," he said, "in which the Kosova question is of priority, 
is rather delicate and complex in the Balkan peninsula. Putting 
it into the agenda of the international questions has become an 
indispensability. In this context, non-removal of the embargo 
against Serbia, dispatch of observers in Kosova and the efforts 
to guarantee Kosova an acceptable status for all parties serve 
the stability in the region. Albania and the Albanian political 
forces wherever they are," Mr. Berisha said, "will try to 
prevent the conflict, whose spillover will bring about a Balkan 
war. Reestablishing of Albanian institutions, the free movement 
of the Albanians, the implementation of the UN resolutions in 
relation with Kosova are the first steps for a dialogue. But 
the Albanians ask that this dialogue be conducted in the 
presence of a third party, because so far Belgrade has left no 
room to act in this direction," Albanian president said. 
  British Premier Major said: "We are worried about the 
situation in the Balkans and appreciate the role of Albania as a 
factor for stability. We are already committed that the embargo 
should continue and we shall work for the dispatch of monitors 
in Kosova." Mr. Major agreed on the questions discussed in the 
meeting and accepted with pleasure the invitation extended to 
him to visit Albania.

  [Text] London, March 29 (BTA) -- President Zhelyu Zhelev 
today delivered a lecture on Bulgaria's European policy at the 
Royal Institute of International Affairs today. That was the 
centerpiece of Dr. Zhelev's visit to London which began 
yesterday. 
  Recalling that in the years of the communist regime, 
Bulgaria's foreign policy was entirely subordinated to the 
former Soviet Union, the Bulgarian head of state stressed 
Bulgaria's foreign policy orientation in the last four years. 
"For the first time in quite some years, Bulgaria has had a 
chance to implement an independent foreign policy on the basis 
of its national interests and the European values, consistent 
with the principles and standards of international law," Dr. 
Zhelev said. 
  He listed the achievements which Bulgaria owes to this new 
policy: membership of the Council of Europe, the Europe 
agreement with the EU [European Union], the free-trade pact with 
EFTA, joining the Partnership for Peace initiative and the 
almost completed negotiations on accession to GATT. Dr. Zhelev 
also noted another area of Bulgaria's European policy: The 
vigorous promotion of bilateral contacts with the key European 
states. He cited the bilateral treaties signed with Germany, 
France, Italy and Spain and the joint declaration on the 
principles of cooperation with the United Kingdom. 
  Bulgaria's Balkan policy also has European dimensions, 
President Zhelev stressed. He recalled that in the last three 
years Bulgaria has signed bilateral treaties with all Balkan 
countries with the exception of ex-Yugoslavia's successor 
states. The president singled out Bulgaria's position on the 
Yugocrisis as a most eloquent proof of Bulgaria's modern foreign 
policy: Restraint and military noninvolvement in the open or 
dormant conflicts within the former Yugoslavia. Dr. Zhelev 
stressed that Bulgaria is applying the Yugosanctions in good 
faith despite the enormous losses it sustains. 
  "Bulgaria's policy towards Russia and the other former 
Soviet 
Republics is just as European in its spirit," the Bulgarian head 
of state observed. He recalled that in the last few years 
Bulgaria has signed bilateral treaties with Russia, Ukraine, 
Kazakhstan, Belarus and Moldova based on equality and mutual 
benefit. 
  Earlier in the day Dr. Zhelev addressed the Confederation of 
British Industry. Discussing the difficulties which Bulgaria is 
experiencing in its transition from command to market economy, 
he emphasized that Bulgaria now needs foreign investment, modern 
infrastructure and access to Western markets. Citing Bulgaria's 
liberal investment regulations and the efficient system of 
guarantees of the rights and interests of foreign investors, Dr. 
Zhelev said that for all that Bulgaria is still seen as a high 
risk country by foreign businessmen. Despite this, however, 55 
British companies already operate in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian 
president said, expressing confidence that the inflow of capital 
will increase substantially this year and in the coming years. 
  Dr. Zhelev thanked Britain for its assistance in the 
negotiations on Bulgaria's association to the European Union. 
Most of the negotiations were held at the time when Britain 
held the EC presidency, he recalled. 
  Later in the day today, the Bulgarian president opened an 
exhibition of Bulgarian artist Atanas Kunchev in London and 
visited the Liberal Club. Tomorrow [30 March] Dr. Zhelev is 
scheduled to confer with British Prime Minister John Major and 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.

Finland, and Norway on 1 January 1995 from the point of view of 
the 12 member states," it is stated in a statement released by

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(Free Democratic Party of Germany) wants the Chinese Government 
to use its influence on Pyongyang in the controversy over North 
Korea's nuclear program. In a talk with Chinese Justice 
Minister Xiao Yang on Tuesday [29 March], Kinkel also pointed to 
China's responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council. Pyongyang refuses to have its nuclear facilities 
inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  At the meeting, Kinkel insisted on the observation of human 
rights in China, a spokesman announced after the meeting. The 
minister emphatically referred to a special human rights case in 
connection with the students' unrest of 1989, in which there has 
still not been any reaction despite repeated requests by Kinkel. 
  The FRG Foreign Minister also advocated a "fair autonomy and 
the protection of the cultural, ethnic, and religious rights" of 
the Tibetans.

  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main/Bonn (DPA) -- German Government 
authorities are currently examining a Mannheim company that the 
UN Sanctions Committee suspects of wanting to help Iraq 
circumvent the economic sanctions imposed after the Gulf War, 
according to FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG (FAZ). The Foreign 
Ministry had passed all information on the enterprise "United 
Oil Company" to the responsible authorities, it was reported in 
Bonn on Tuesday [29 March]. According to Tuesday's FAZ, a firm 
with only a post office box address is hidden behind the 
enterprise. 
  According to the FAZ report, in February the Mannheim firm 
applied for a permit for the delivery of almost 2 million tonnes 
of foodstuffs and other goods valued at a total of $1.343 
billion (2.3 billion German marks -- DM) to Iraq. The Foreign 
Ministry passed this application on to the Sanctions Committee 
for Iraq, "apparently, without having previously been briefed on 
the business background of the enterprise mentioned," it was 
further stated. 
  According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts, his 
ministry passed the export application on to the UN Sanctions 
Committee in February, with the remark that the inner-German 
authorization still has to be obtained. So far, however, 
neither German authorities nor the UN committee has authorized 
the delivery. The examination in the UN Sanctions Committee is 
often lengthy. It serves the interests of the economy if 
applications of this kind are initiated before the internal 
control process -- among others, the Federal Export Office in 
Eschborn near Frankfurt is responsible for it -- is concluded, 
Gerdts said. 
  According to the FAZ, the enterprise allegedly wants to 
export foodstuffs, soap, and other goods. The goods correspond 
to the unusual amount of more than 50 shiploads. Moreover, it 
is unusual that the post-office box number in Amman (Jordan) 
given for the alleged interim addressee in the applications 
turned out to be the address of a hotel chain. "Only hotel 
guests who want to `cover up' that the receiver is a hotel guest 
use this post-office box," the FAZ wrote. 
  The delivery list presented to the United Nations also 
contained strange things. Several goods were to be procured at 
unusual prices. For example, the enterprise wanted to export 
100,000 tonnes of "cleansing soap" from German production at a 
price of $4 (DM6.8) per tonne to Iraq. Since not even the 
cheapest soap can be obtained at that price, one is now asking 
whether the Mannheim enterprise really wants to procure the 
specified goods, the FAZ writes. 
  Meanwhile, the United Nations has enough experience with 
Iraq's ingenuity in order to achieve the release of the frozen 
Iraqi foreign exchange. However, the Sanctions Committee for 
Iraq will have to authorize the deal involving billions, "not 
least because German authorities have refused to help so far," 
the FAZ wrote. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Udo Steinbach, head of the German 
Orient Institute in Hamburg, has warned that further acts of 
violence may committed by Kurds in Germany. In an interview 
with the Berlin daily B.Z. [BERLINER ZEITUNG] (Tuesday edition), 
the expert on Turkey said: "I would not rule out that, if the 
overall situation escalates, we will also have to fear an 
escalation of terrorism in our country, even up to 
hostage-taking." 
  To the extent to which the military situation in 
southeastern 
Turkey becomes more dramatic and the Germans continue to supply 
weapons, one is increasingly facing the Kurds' dissatisfaction, 
the scientist said. This is expressed more and more in militant 
actions. "Therefore, we must also expect retaliatory attacks 
against German institutions," Steinbach said. Actually, highway 
blockades are already a step toward this end.

increased their protective measures for "Israeli objects" in 
Bonn. Among other things, the police closed the main 
thoroughfare where the Israeli Embassy is located. In the next 
few days, residents will have to identify themselves if they 
want to get to their houses. Normal traffic is being diverted 
on a large scale. According to the police, the German security 
authorities have been given tip-offs that Israeli "objects" 
might become targets of terrorist attacks.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The Central Council of Jews 
in Germany has demanded the "legal, political, and social 
ostracism" of right-wing extremists. The attack on the 
synagogue in Luebeck was an attack on "the substance of 
democracy," Presidium member Michel Friedman said in an 
interview with DPA in Frankfurt. The approximately 50,000 Jews 
in Germany are citizens of this country and "Jewish identity is 
part of the overall society." 
  "The intellectual originators and arsonists of 
anti-Semitism" 
are the right-wing extremist Republikaner with their chairman 
Franz Schoenhuber, who called Central Council Chairman Ignatz 
Bubis an "instigator of people." They want to turn the victims 
into perpetrators to divert attention from their own guilt, 
Friedman said, who is also a member of the committee of the 
Jewish Community in the city on the Main. 
  "There must not be any tolerance toward intolerance." The 
first victims are always the minorities, but in the end every 
citizen is in danger if the society does not defend itself 
against violence: "Violence is eating from the fringe toward the 
inside." Friedman criticized the silence and passiveness of 
many citizens: "Most people are not hostile toward people, but 
many are too indifferent."

  [Text] Wiesbaden (DPA) -- Cracks in a steel pipe caused 
the latest incident in the controversial Biblis nuclear power 
plant in Hesse. This was reported by the Environment Ministry 
of the land in Wiesbaden on Monday [28 March]. The pipe in 
question in Block A, where contaminated water had leaked out 
from a pipe for the taking of samples, was checked. First 
results of a metallographical expert report of the 
Krafwerksunion (KWU) Company showed that the major number of 
cracks had probably been caused by chlorine, it was stated. 
  The nuclear supervisory board in Hesse took out a one-meter 
long section of the defective pipe of the pressure-keeping 
system. Part of it will be further checked in a Finnish 
material-testing laboratory. According to its own information, 
the Environment Ministry will only agree to repairs when the 
cause of the damage has been clarified without any doubt.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- After almost two years of 
negotiations, the German-Czech asylum agreement is obviously on 
the point of being concluded. Just a few "details of protocol" 
still have to be settled, FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) said in an interview with 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG. 
  More than a week ago the two countries agreed on the basic 
text. According to this agreement, people who cross the border 
illegally can be deported during a period of up to a year after 
the crossing of the border. During the first three days it will 
be possible to send them back without starting asylum procedures. 
  In 1993 about 30,000 people entered Germany illegally from 
the Czech Republic, Kanther said. The focus is the Czech-Saxony 
border, because there the country is "extremely difficult." 
Prague has developed into the "center of criminal smuggling of 
people." 
  The weekly FOCUS reports that the amount of money that 
Germany has to pay in return for the agreement has not yet been 
negotiated. Prague reportedly declared the sum of 120 million 
marks to be a "yardstick," which had been promised to Poland 
after the conclusion of a similar agreement with the FRG about a 
year ago.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- In the view of Bundesbank 
President Hans Tietmeyer, inflation will continue to slow down 
during the course of the year. Nevertheless, the annual rate of 
3.4 percent worked out in February is still too high. "The 
basic trend suggests that price increases, which are influenced 
by domestic policy, will continue to slow down in the next few 
months" Tietmeyer said in Frankfurt on Friday [25 March]. 
Nevertheless, he was rather cautious as far as the Bundesbank's 
room for further interest cuts is concerned. At a time of 
nervous markets, new expectations of inflation might flare up 
quickly. "This is why we will stick to our policy of a quiet 
hand in the future, too." 
  According to preliminary figures from three laender, price 
increases are expected to slow down again in March. On Friday, 
the Statistical Land Office in Wiesbaden noted that in Hesse, 
consumer prices were 3.2 percent (previous month: 3.4) higher 
than one year ago. Yesterday, North Rhine-Westphalia reported 
an annual rate of 3.1 percent (3.2), and thus the lowest 
increase in almost three years. The figure for 
Baden-Wuerttemberg was also 3.1 (3.4) percent. 
  Tietmeyer said that the wage policy of the trade unions and 
the employers has been favorable for price stability this year. 
"Decisions in connection with wage policy have so far done 
justice to both the requirements in terms of stability and 
growth and employment to a greater degree than last year." Even 
the public sector has displayed growing awareness of the 
problems regarding the revision of financial policy. Yet, 
according to Tietmeyer, the strong expansion in the money supply 
advises to be very careful. The projected annual rate of 17.6 
percent, which was announced the previous day, must "not simply 
be taken as the yardstick for the development in the further 
course of the year," the Bundesbank head said. "On the other 
hand we cannot and must not simply ignore these results." 
Continual high growth rates might mean the development of a new 
potential for inflation.

  [Excerpts] Kassel (DPA) -- Nine months after its founding 
in Hamburg the Instead Party set its course for the super 
election year 1994 over the weekend [26-27 March]. At the first 
federal congress in Kassel delegates from six laender elected a 
Federal Executive Committee and decided to participate in the 
European elections on 12 June. However, the precondition for 
the definite participation in the European elections is the 
founding of associations in most laender by 12 May. The party 
congress elected Bernd Schoenemann, a 49-year-old criminal-law 
professor from Munich, as new federal chairman. Last June the 
Instead Party was founded by ex-Christian Democratic Union rebel 
Markus Wegner in Hamburg and is represented in the land 
government there. 
  During a discussion on Sunday, which lasted for four hours, 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, and Thuringia called for 
participating in the European elections, while representatives 
from Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, and Hesse came out against it. 
[passage omitted] 
  The federal congress has not yet agreed on new guidelines 
for 
federal policy but has taken over the principles of the Hamburg 
mother party for the time being. These principles proclaim the 
introduction of plebiscitary elements, the slimming down of 
parliaments, the abolition of mandatory party vote, and more 
business-like instead of ideology-oriented policy. Mike 
Bashford, Juergen Pilligrath, Sabine Winter, Bernhard 
Engelbrecht, and six assessors from the land associations were 
elected to the Executive Committee in addition to Schoenemann. 
The next founding of associations of the Instead Party, which 
has about 2,500 members all over Germany, is supposed to take 
place in Berlin on 23 April and in North Rhine-Westphalia at the 
beginning of May.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by Laurence </F>
Masurel and Valerie Massonneau; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [PARIS MATCH] What is your diagnosis of the state 
of France one year after the Balladur government took office? 
  [Pasqua] The recovery has been started. When we came to 
power, one year ago, the situation which we found was much worse 
than we had imagined: 350 billion francs [Fr] of budget 
deficit; Fr100 billion of social security deficit; a pension 
system on the verge of explosion; and 30,000 jobs being lost 
each month. We found a France in collapse, threatened by social 
division. From our government experience in 1986, we had 
already learned that it takes 18 months for any measure to 
produce an effect. The economic recovery which we are already 
detecting today in several sectors will be really noticeable by 
the end of the year. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Does the revolt which is brewing against the 
CIP [Job Training Contracts] not condemn the government to 
refrain from introducing any more reforms? 
  [Pasqua] It is well known that it is when the economy starts 
to recover that tensions are most acute. The demonstrations by 
young people could be predicted. They were part of my diagnosis 
when I toured France's 22 regions to present my regional 
development plan. I really saw this danger when I saw all those 
young people unemployed who are entitled to nothing until they 
are 25. But, above all, we must not stop introducing reforms; 
instead we should go further and faster. This does not mean 
that we should not listen to the French people. Consultation is 
more necessary than ever. It is vital to listen to the people, 
to meet with them, to ask them their opinion on every questions. 
In Japan, that is called "wasting your time usefully." 
  [PARIS MATCH] Precisely on the subject of the CIP, has the 
government made the mistake of communicating badly? 
  [Pasqua] Perhaps there was not enough explanation. But what 
strikes me most is the trade unions' attitude. I sometimes 
dream of very strong and powerful trade unions in France, as 
there are in Germany, with which we could really negotiate 
without ulterior motives and without archaic attitudes. 
Although some trade unions have made considerable efforts to 
change, others are locked in suicidal obstinacy. To give an 
example: Look at what happened in some big French ports like 
Marseilles. 
  [PARIS MATCH] What assessment would Pasqua, the teacher, 
write on the government's school report? "Could do better" or 
"satisfactory results?" 
  [Pasqua] The government has done as well as it could. 
Moreover, the French people are under no illusion because, in 
the canton elections, they have just expressed their confidence 
in it, which is a way of saying to the others: "Let it do its 
work." But the government's handicap is that it cannot move 
more quickly than the country's complex and archaic structures 
permit. To carry out a reform, it often takes a year. My bill 
on regional development, which will be presented to Parliament 
in July during an extraordinary session, will reduce the 
cumbersome procedures which the state imposes on any reform. 
Today, you really have to have fierce determination to succeed! 
  [PARIS MATCH] You just have one year left before the 
presidential election in which to make progress. Is that not 
too little? 
  [Pasqua] We have even less time left because we must carry 
out the reforms before the start of the presidential election 
campaign, which will start on 1 January 1995 at the latest. 
  [PARIS MATCH] In this connection, surely the statements by 
Francois Leotard and Simone Veil at the end of December, and 
then those by Patrick Balkany, deputy mayor of Levallois -- one 
of those close to you -- in favor of Balladur declaring his 
candidacy early, have already launched major maneuvers? 
  [Pasqua] All these statements, which I deplore, make me fear 
that we may already have launched into a kind of incredible 
race! I personally do not want the campaign to start now. 
Everybody should decide on his candidate at the end of the 
year. Edouard Balladur does not want this debate to be launched 
before the end of the year any more than I do. It is not in 
anybody's interest, not that of Chirac, nor that of Balladur. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Some people claim that you have already 
chosen the Balladur camp.... 
  [Pasqua] That is impossible! I will tell you why. Quite 
simply because, for the time being, Balladur is not a candidate. 
But it is natural that I should be loyal to the head of the 
government in which, I remind you, I am one of the ministers of 
state. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Let us put the question differently. What is 
your judgment of Edouard Balladur and his first year in the 
Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office]? 
  [Pasqua] Edouard Balladur has an essential quality: He is 
pragmatic. He does not prejudge anything. He is the reverse of 
an ideologue, but that does not prevent him from having ideas. 
That suits me. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Do you not think that the majority has had 
enough and is criticizing him a great deal? 
  [Pasqua] It is natural that the deputies should play their 
role in the Assembly, even when they complain a little. What is 
dubious is the criticism made outside Parliament by some of the 
majority's leaders. 
  [PARIS MATCH] Let us return to the presidential election. 
Are you still convinced that only primaries will prevent the 
Right from division? 
  [Pasqua] My approach has not changed. I will do all I can 
to ensure that my plan for primaries leads to there being a 
single majority candidate in the first round of the presidential 
election. In the spirit of the Fifth Republic Constitution, it 
is not the parties which choose the candidates; it is a man who 
decides alone and who makes a personal choice in presenting 
himself to the country. Only then is it the parties who decide 
to support him. This is the principle which the majority parties 
have accepted in accepting the system of primaries. 
  [PARIS MATCH] How do you see these primaries? 
  [Pasqua] It is a good thing for there to be several 
prospective candidates. Within the RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
and UDF [Union for French Democracy], this would be indicative 
of the majority's vitality and richness! It should not become 
its handicap. The advantage of these primaries is that these 
candidates will not stand against each other but on the same 
line, agreeing to support the one who emerges. 
  [PARIS MATCH] How will you submit this bill, if there is 
one? 
  [Pasqua] There are various ways of going about it. The 
simplest would consist of just reforming the law on the funding 
of election campaigns, adding to it the funding of primaries to 
ensure that their funding is not included in the funding of the 
presidential campaign. 
  [PARIS MATCH] How will you convince all the potential 
candidates -- Chirac, Barre, Balladur, Giscard, Monory, and 
others -- to bow to this unaccustomed ritual of primaries? 
  [Pasqua] They will all be so pressured by public opinion, 
which will not tolerate the idea of a conflict or a division, 
that they will have no choice. When we were in opposition, all 
the majority leaders signed an agreement in favor of primaries. 
I think that their signature is a commitment by each of them. 
We have succeeded in having a single union candidate in all the 
elections. That has worked for the parliamentary elections, for 
the canton elections, and for the European elections. Who would 
understand it if the majority was divided in the first round of 
the presidential election? 
  [PARIS MATCH] Will you be a candidate? 
  [Pasqua] There are enough candidates in the majority, I am 
not doing this for myself! 
  [PARIS MATCH] And yet, your faultless performance in the 
Interior and Regional Development Ministry would justify your 
candidacy. Some are thinking about it on your behalf. 
  [Pasqua] When I am in one camp, I am always loyal. I 
learned this lesson from General de Gaulle and I apply it every 
day: "The general interest prevails over all private 
interests." Those who have forgotten this lesson ought to 
belong to a different political family from mine.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mideast/Italy: Go Italy Would </F>
Review Policies, Rivolta Says"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Tel Aviv, March 29 -- A right-wing Italian 
government led by Go Italy [Forza Italia] would take a more 
"balanced" attitude towards Israel than past governments have, 
according to Dario Rivolta, a close aide of Go Italy leader 
Silvio Berlusconi. 
  In an interview with Israeli military radio on Tuesday [29 
March], Rivolta asserted that past Italian governments had a 
"pro-Arab and pro-Palestinian" foreign policy, adding: "That was 
the attitude of left-wing parties, which always tend to support 
the Arab political line." What Italy should do, Rivolta went on, 
is "to understand the true difficulties of the present situation 
and the seriousness of the obstacles blocking dialogue between 
Israelis and Palestinians." 
  Berlusconi last week told the Tel Aviv daily, YEDI'OT 
AHARONOT, that he was a true friend of Israel and praised the 
policies of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  Interviewed by Israel's military radio, Israeli ambassador 
in 
Rome Avi Pazner denied Rivolta's claim that Italian foreign 
policy could be described as "pro-Arab." "For 2-3 years, in 
other words, since the start of the peace process, you can no 
longer talk about a pro-Arab Italian foreign policy," he said. 
"If anything, there is a policy in favour of peace, which 
includes expressions of friendship for Israel." 
  According to Pazner, after a conversation with the media 
mogul a couple of weeks ago, he believes that, if Berlusconi 
forms a government, he would expect it to be friendly towards 
Israel. "He's not about to form a clearly right-wing 
government," the diplomat said. "Even if he counts on 
right-wing support, Berlusconi is a man of the centre whose 
concerns include relations with Europe, the United States, 
Israel and also the Italian Jewish community."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi on Leaving; Disarray on the </F>
Victorious Right"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, March 30 -- Premier Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi told his cabinet today he looked forward to turning his 
office over to the new head of government as winner Silvio 
Berlusconi spoke of intentions to form a "political" executive 
and his key ally reiterated his total opposition to seeing 
Berlusconi in the premier's office. 
  Against the backdrop of the split between Berlusconi, the 
media mogul who led his three-month old Forza Italia to victory 
in the just-concluded general election, and Northern League 
leader Umberto Bossi, Ciampi said, "The government hopes to be 
able, as soon as possible, to hand matters on to the new 
government which will be named by the president of the republic 
on the basis of the electoral results." 
  The premier who took over in April last year, as the first 
non-politician and non-member of Parliament to hold this office, 
also spoke of hopes for "a climate of stability and correct 
civil co-existence, necessary conditions for facing the complex 
problems before the nation." He went on to voice "the 
satisfaction of the government with the orderly conduct of the 
campaign and voting operations which brought in the Parliament 
of the twelfth legislature. 
  ``The government,'' he added, ``is beginning to conclude its 
duties of management and as institutional guarantor in a 
sensitive phase of transition with results which testify to the 
country's basic steadiness and capacity for renewal in the 
political, economic and social fields and in democratic 
security.'' 
  In the wings, Berlusconi said all the alignments in his 
Forza 
Italia-led Freedom Front should be involved in the formation of 
a government, "just as indicated by the voters," and that the 
new executive should be "political" rather than a cabinet of 
"technocrats." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Winners and Losers and Those in </F>
Between"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 29 -- Forza Italia leader Silvio 
Berlusconi said today he was certain his victorious right-wing 
Freedom Front alliance would not "betray" the will of Italian 
voters who demanded a force which will give "a majority to the 
country" and "a strong and authoritative government" while a 
Democratic Party of the Left senator acknowledged what he said 
was the "clear-cut defeat of the the Progressives." 
  Berlusconi, the Milan media and publishing magnate who 
joined 
forces with the noisy Northern League and the neo-Fascist based 
National Alliance in January, declared, "I have no uncertainty 
in relations with the League" against the backdrop of rumblings 
from League leader Umberto Bossi against the Forza Italia 
driving force and the neo-Fascists under the Freedom Front 
umbrella. 
  Bossi was quoted in today's newspapers as saying he opposed 
seeing Berlusconi in the premier's office, as appeared more than 
likely according to a reading of the tallies and projections as 
he spoke, and would never go into government with the 
neo-Fascist "lynch mob" in the winning coalition. 
  In his first interview in the flush of victory, Berlusconi 
said, "I think relations are totally positive. The League 
candidates will now look behind the votes they have won and 
they'll be aware that the votes for the pole were in the 
majority. 
  ``So I don't think there will be any betrayal of the voters 
who indicated exactly what they want: the formation of a unified 
pole which gives a majority to the country and expresses a 
strong and authoritative government,'' added the 
businessman-turned-politician. 
  Asked whether he had his gaze set on Palazzo Chigi, the 
premier's office, he said the answer will come from Head of 
State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro who will "read the vote and act in 
consequence." 
  On the incomplete tallies, which show Forza Italia, the 
Northern League and National Alliance with a comfortable 
majority in Lower House voting in capturing 355 seats, with 316 
needed for a majority, and close to majority in the Senate, 
Berlusconi said the was pleased but, he added, "as for Forza 
Italia, we thought it would get even a better result." 
  Later in the day, Berlusconi conferred for three house with 
ally Gianfranco Fini, who took his neo-Fascist MSI [Italian 
Social Movement] through a name-change to become the National 
Alliance which flanked Forza Italia in the south. The likely 
premier-designate also talked over the telephone to other 
representatives in his Freedom Front, League theoretician 
Gianfranco Miglio, and Centrist Union leaders Raffaele Costa, 
the outgoing transport minister, and Alfredo Biondi, both 
erst-while Liberals. 
  In the vicinity was Cesare Previti, a successful Forza 
Italia 
candidate, who told reporters that he thought differences with 
Bossi could be patched up. "There are no problems of principle 
because it seems to me that Bossi was critical of the `lynch 
mob' right and Fini certainly does not belong to this category." 
  On the League leader's "veto" levied against Berlusconi in 
the premier's office, Previti remarked, "Never say never," and 
said a meeting between the two men would be set up for the near 
future but had not yet been scheduled. 
  As the Forza Italia leader conferred, the movement's 
spokesman, Antonio Tajani, said a press conference Berlusconi 
had announced had been cancelled but that he will take to the 
airwaves in the evening in an interview to be broadcast by the 
public radio and television corporation's channel one news 
program. 
  On the left, the Democratic Party of the Left whip in the 
Senate, Giuseppe Chiarante, said that arising from the ballot 
boxes is a "split between three Italies, the north, the center 
and the south" and spoke of the "dangerous logic" of the 
first-past-the-post system used for the first time in the 
watershed general election. According to the senator, the result 
of changes in the voting rules dictated by a national referendum 
vote in April last year, intended to give voters clear choices 
"to guarantee a stable and lasting government," will be 
difficulty in forming a government because of disarray on the 
right, "though they came out as clear-cut winners." 
  After arguing that the ballot has "led Italian democracy 
into 
a dangerous blind alley," Chiarante said, "As far as the 
Progressives are concerned, it cannot be hidden that the defeat 
was clear-cut and, in certain parts of the country, like the 
North, especially heavy." He concluded his comment on the 
outcome of the vote by pledging that the "electoral 
understanding among the Progressives" will be further forged 
into "more consolidated democratic unity to make of this line-up 
a base and a point of departure for more dynamic and innovative 
political proposals which will not allow the right -- as has 
happened in part, paradoxically -- to present itself as a new 
and more modern force." 
  The speaker of the Senate, Giovanni Spadolini, said today, 
in 
substance, the people voted and, in the coming months, 
corrections can be applied to the electoral laws as required. 
"But this electoral law corresponded to the indications of the 
people as clearly sanctioned in the referendum, no to party rule 
and corruption," he said with reference to the intentions of the 
referendum proposal architects to loosen the political party 
hold on public life and allow voters to vote the candidate. 
Talk now of an early end to the Parliament just voted into 
office, the twelfth post-war legislature of the republic, is 
"out of place," said Spadolini. "This Parliament, thanks to the 
seal of legitimacy received from the people, must find the 
energy to face and solve its major duties: first among them the 
start-up of institutional renewal in the country and the 
modernization of the state machinery to the level of new 
challenges," he added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Scalfaro and Politicians Look </F>
Ahead"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 29 -- Head of State Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro called on the new Parliament to "guarantee stability" 
and praised the Italians for the "great democratic testimony" 
given in the watershed general election as the leader of the 
Democratic Party of the Left acknowledged defeat and urged the 
president to name Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate swept to 
victory at the helm of his Freedom Front alliance, 
premier-designate. 
  Scalfaro, looking ahead to the opening of the twelfth 
legislature of the republic, declared, "I think this Parliament 
has the right to work with tranquillity, to do well and do 
much." The people of Italy "expect much" of the new houses he 
said and went on to name the weighty issues of institutional 
reform, the battle against unemployment and monetary policy. 
The head of state said he felt it his duty to now break the 
silence he had kept during the campaign to speak out with "a 
truly great word of admiration for the Italian people who have", 
he said, given "great democratic testimony to themselves, to 
Europe, to the world." 
  After referring to the new electoral law and the string of 
business and political corruption scandals which decimated the 
ruling political parties over the past two years, since the 
general election of April 1992, Scalfaro noted that the crucial 
Sunday [27 March] and Monday vote also marked "the exit from the 
scene of a series of figures even of the foremost rank, the 
birth of new and recent movements." All this, he added, 
"certainly represented a stage of great significance after that 
of the referendum, another stage of great importance," with 
reference to the national vote of April last year which forced 
the change in the electoral law. 
  Driving home his main point, the head of state reiterated, 
"There is need for stability, for great solidarity" and said he 
himself, above the fray, could hope for the commitment of the 
new Parliament "to one thing: the interest of this, our Italy." 
  On the institutional steps ahead of the inaugural session of 
the new Parliament, set for April 15, Cabinet Undersecretary 
Antonio Maccanico told newsmen that, the government led by 
Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, in office since the end of April 
last year, will remain in office until a new administration is 
formed. "Before the new houses are convened, the cabinet will 
meet to consider law decrees requiring government mandates 
connected to the budget. These decrees will, obviously, be 
examined by the new Parliament," he added. 
  On what is in the wings, Democratic Party of the Left leader 
Achille Occhetto declared, "The vote was clear, it gave the 
majority to the right. According to me, the president must give 
the mandate to the one mainly responsible for the right-wing 
front, that is, Berlusconi." Interviewed on the news program on 
the public radio and television corporation's third channel, the 
head of the party around which the Progressive Coalition battled 
against the Berlusconi's Freedom Front added, "Then we'll see 
whether Berlusconi is able to form a government on the platform 
and the plan of relations with his allies. If he's not able, 
we'll see later on." 
  Occhetto went on to speak of the need now for unity and 
said, 
"The Democratic Party of the Left had a splendid result and is 
at the service of all in this direction, for the expansion of 
all the others." 
  Moving over to another RAI interview, the party leader said 
the right is self-sufficient and should be able to stand on its 
own and promised "a severe, clear and precise opposition" from 
the left benches and work for "the creation of conditions for an 
alternative government." 
  On the failure of the Progressives to top the right at the 
polls, Occhetto said, "I'm not blaming myself too much. We 
faced the general election in the same way we faced the 
administrative vote. There was an element of surprise. The 
speedy organization achieved with all the company instruments of 
the new political component acted as a glue for two different 
right-wings. This effect went beyond our expectations," he 
added. 
  A key factor in the staying in power of Berlusconi's Freedom 
Front, the outspoken Northern League leader Umberto Bossi, 
applied a farming metaphor in saying issues were now on 
"shifting soil" whereas his League is the only force which is 
"compact enough within" to work for change. 
  The man who sounded a sour note in the midst of victory 
hurrahs on the right last night, in saying he did not want to 
see Berlusconi in the premier's office and would never align the 
League in government with the neo-Fascist "lynch mob," said 
today that his alignment is the only one capable of "giving the 
country a government." Speaking in his stronghold in Milan, 
Bossi declared, "An enormous political responsibility has been 
laid on the shoulders of the League. We have to form a 
government and the only political force which is the elite in 
government at this time is the League. Now we are going to deal. 
We will take the first steps already in the upcoming 24 hours," 
added Berlusconi's ally in the north. He also warned, "If the 
press pushes for government formation, we have the duty to go 
forward with feet of lead because we are on shifting soil" and, 
he added, "if someone goes on a shopping trip in the League, I 
remind him we are compact and monolithic." 
  On the right, Giancarlo Fini, who steered his neo-Fascist 
MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] out of a political cul-de-sac to 
become the National Alliance in league with Berlusconi, spoke of 
the need for detente with Bossi in telling a press conference of 
his two conditions for reaching a government-forming 
understanding "based on documents and not on ideological 
slogans." 
  First, said Fini, is "the impossibility" of a League member 
to become premier "because the League is an expression of a 
geographic area and not the entire nation." Second is that the 
mandate go to Berlusconi, "at least in the initial phase." 
Questioned on his "intellectual differences" with the League 
leader, Fini quipped, "Never use the adjective 'intellectual' 
with reference to Bossi."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Senate Hanging in the Balance"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 29 -- Though the right-wing 
alliance can count on a safe majority in the Lower House, with 
366 seats in the 630-seat chamber or 50 over the quorum, matters 
in the Senate were still unclear and are likely to remain so 
until the first test is put to this house. 
  There are 326 seats in the Upper House, 315 elected plus 11 
life senators, with 164 seats required for a majority as 
compared to the 155 newly-elected or incumbent senators under 
the loose-knit Freedom Front banner. The variables in the 
search for the other nine votes are now thought to be infinite. 
  Under focus could be the three senators sent to Rome from 
the 
northern Trentino Alto Adige region for the German-speaking 
Suedtiroler Volkspartei [SVP]. This party, however, issued a 
communique today saying, "From the present, the SVP excludes any 
form of cooperation with a government which, beside Forza Italia 
and the Northern League, sees the presence of the neo-Fascists," 
or the National Alliance southern leg of the Freedom Pole tripod. 
  The SVP also said, "the exclusion" of the National Alliance 
would "leave open the hope that Forza Italia and the Northern 
League could commit themselves to a federalist system in the 
framework of which there would be necessary attention given to 
the minorities." 
  Others who could receive Freedom Pole overtures in the new 
Senate are the successful candidate of the Valdostana Union, the 
Alpine League senator and the one brought in on the Pannella 
slate. 
  Aside from possible swing votes in the strongly-flattened 
center, with 31 seats as compared to 122 sewn up for the 
Progressive Coalition, the life senators could be crucial. 
These are former Heads of State Francesco Cossiga and Giovanni 
Leone and Giulio Andreotti, Paolo Emilio Taviani, Giovanni 
Agnelli, Carlo Bo, Norberto Bobbio, Leo Valiani, Giovanni 
Spadolini, Francesco De Martino and Amintore Fanfani.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Unions Say Incomes Policy Must Be </F>
Maintained"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 29 -- The agreement on labour 
costs signed last July as the cornerstone of the incomes policy 
that many see as a major factor in Italy's recent economic 
improvements must be kept as it is by whatever government comes 
to power after the two-day general election, union leaders 
warned here today. 
  "There's no alternative," said Pietro Larizza, 
secretary-general of the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade 
Unions] labour federation. "If the new executive decides to 
interrupt the present model of economic and welfare state 
management, room would emerge for concern and hostility since 
our productive system would be headed for economic adventures." 
"In other words," he explained, "the ball is now in the court 
of whoever offers himself to lead the country. Italy's hopes of 
emerging from the crisis depend on what government programme he 
offers." 
  Concern over governability after the elections also emerged 
from the observations of Guglielmo Epifani, assistant 
secretary-general at the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of 
Labor] labour federation, by far the country's largest, ahead of 
the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and the UIL, in 
that order. "The platforms presented by the Right are very 
distant from the unions are proposing," he said. "Certainly, if 
I were to go by the platforms circulating during the election 
campaign, I would have reason for alarm," added Raffaele Morese, 
assistant secretary- general at the CISL, who added that people 
now had to get used to alternation between opposition and 
government. 
  "It remains to be seen how the electoral alliance will be 
transformed in a government alliance," he added as top union 
officials said a meeting of the Big Three labour federations 
already scheduled tomorrow for consultations on trade-union 
unity would now devote some time to the political situation. 
"One can imagine Italy with the most laissez-faire government 
in its history," added Morese, "but you certainly can't imagine 
it with higher inflation or high unemployment." 
  Morese also noted in a warning footnote that the new 
government could "theoretically" decide its majority is all it 
needs to govern: "But the case of the Balladur government in 
France is a lesson; when you decide without the consent of the 
other partners to the social pact, you may be forced into 
reverse by what happens in the streets." 
  Morese's superior at the CISL, Secretary-General Sergio 
D'Antoni, agreed that judgement should be suspended until the 
government platform is clear, but the Berlusconi cartel has 
"distinguished itself only for its contradictory proposals, with 
a touch of laissez-faire, corporativism, a vocation to state 
interventionism and secessionist temptations." 
  In an article to be published by a trade-union periodical 
tomorrow, D'Antoni said the premises for the unions' position 
remains a debate in a "constructive spirit" on "work, employment 
and social equity." 
  On the extreme right, the CISNAL [Italian Confederation of 
National Trade Unions] labour federation, the neo-Fascist labour 
organisation whose political equivalent is now the National 
Alliance, also pledged firm support for keeping social 
insurance, health and education in government hands, against 
plans from other members of the Berlusconi cartel for radical 
privatisation. "If anything," said the CISNAL, "the systems for 
managing social welfare programmes must be re-designed and their 
objectives renewed so as to re-establish efficiency and 
administrative transparency."

  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 29 -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta, in his role as duty chairman of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, has expressed 
his pleasure over the recent inking of a friendship and 
cooperation agreement between Lithuania and Poland, according to 
a Farnesina [Foreign Ministry] communique today. 
  Such an agreement is an example of how misunderstandings of 
the past can be overcome in a framework of cooperation and in a 
European spirit so as to give a new positive dimension to 
bilateral relations among neighboring countries, according to 
Andreatta. 
  The accord can be seen as fully ensconced within the 
framework of fundamental CSCE principles and constitutes an 
important contribution to security and stability in the entire 
region, the communique added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fintecna Announces Privatisation </F>
Plans"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 23 -- Fintecna, the IRI 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] company which groups 
the state-owned holding's plant and construction interests, will 
sell off its whole stake in controlled firms in a privatisation 
programme to be completed within 2-3 years, managing director 
Renato Cassaro said Wednesday [23 March]. 
  In a press conference to announce the sell-off plan, Cassaro 
said that Autostrade would become a public company, Aeroporti di 
Roma would seek a partner and form a controlling core 
shareholding while selling off remaining stocks, and 
construction and engineering concerns would be sold off in 
various different ways. 
  For Italimpianti, with orders on its books worth around one 
trillion lire (600 million dollars), Cassaro foresaw 
privatisation moves in six months to a year, with a partner 
being sought for a joint venture, and Fintecna retaining a 
shareholding for the next three years. 
  In the building area, some mergers will be needed in a 
reorganisation plan which is being financed by IRI to the tune 
of 1.349 trillion lire (803 million dollars), with permission to 
gather a further 150 billion lire (89 million dollars) on the 
market. 
  In a related development, the anti-trust committee Wednesday 
gave the go-ahead for the transfer of holdings from IRI's 
Iritecna, now in liquidation, to Fintecna. 
  Fintecna receives 43 percent of Aeroporti di Roma stock, 
66.2 
percent of Autostrade, 90 percent of Autostrade International, 
91.16 percent of Condotte, 52.4 percent of Pavimental, 98 
percent of Spea-Ingegneria Europea, 100 percent of Servizi 
Tecnici, 56.99 percent of Sovis, 100 percent of Italimpianti, 
and 99.99 percent of Italstat International.

<F P=106> [Anabel Diez and Luis R. Aizpeolea report: "Gonzalez Calls </F>
For Ideas To be Clarified and Wounds Stanched"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- They met, talked, and lunched together. 
What is not yet known is whether they reached agreement and how 
the possible agreement would take shape. Felipe Gonzalez opened 
the 33d PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] Congress 
yesterday with a conciliatory image. He made his entrance into 
the Madrid Conference Center auditorium -- packed with 4,000 
people, including delegates, guests, observers, and journalists 
-- chatting with Deputy Secretary General Alfonso Guerra, and 
his speech was intended to calm the turbulent party waters. The 
PSOE number one called for unity, clarity of ideas, and the will 
"to stanch wounds," in order to enter a new and difficult stage. 
His speech was followed by 300 news media, represented by 1,000 
professionals. 
  Gonzalez devoted an hour to his declaration of intentions, 
an 
aperitif to the marathon of debates which tomorrow will be 
transformed into ideological and program resolutions and 
political and party organization plans. A relaxed but rather 
cold atmosphere was the keynote of the congress' first few 
hours, as if there had not been long months of discord and 
confrontation. 
  The Socialist leader made clear what he wants: To defend the 
left's own values, but with feasible proposals, geared to 
society and, above all, economically sustainable. "Any hope 
that is not founded on reality is in danger of fading," said 
Gonzalez, who appealed for loyalty and the stanching of wounds. 
He himself set to work by lunching with the deputy secretary 
general -- their first private meeting for eight months. 
  Many delegates were asking in a critical tone why their 
secretary general and the number two did not sit down and talk a 
few days earlier, and when it was learned that the meeting had 
taken place yesterday, relief spread like wildfire through the 
Exhibition Center. There was no agreement but some important 
guidelines for rapprochement, according to prominent Guerraists. 
Guerra's formal response and the ensuing exchange of views took 
place in the early hours of the morning. 
  This meeting and Gonzalez' invitation to the delegates to 
speak freely helped to enliven the rest of the first day. 
Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra proposed that the "irregular 
or corrupt" conduct "which has cast shadows over politics in 
general and the Socialists in particular" be "firmly" clamped 
down on in the "new stage" now beginning. Serra, who spoke on 
behalf of the Catalan delegation, urged the party to strive to 
approach society and called for courage to explain unpopular 
measures. 
  Guerraist Jaime Blanco, secretary general in Cantabria, 
deplored the lack of solidarity in the party at difficult 
moments, and cited the Filesa affair in order to state that many 
comrades had dissociated themselves from the Executive 
Committee. In another tone, Madrid chairman Joaquin Leguina 
enumerated the scandals which have tainted the PSOE, and 
concluded: "Let those who do such things pay for it." 
  Before these speeches, Gonzalez addressed the hall as prime 
minister and the Spanish Socialists' leader. His speech 
recalled much of the election program defended by the PSOE nine 
months ago, with the leitmotiv of the framework report prepared 
for this congress and with measures reminiscent of the white 
paper against unemployment of European Commission President 
Jacques Delors. 
  The Socialist leader was scarcely interrupted during his 
speech, which was read, and was free from demagogic tones. He 
sought not applause but consensus and agreement among grassroots 
who have shown with almost 8,000 amendments that "between yellow 
and red they stand at a strong pink," in the words of Madrid 
chairman Joaquin Leguina. Freedom, equality, and solidarity are 
the three elements which Felipe Gonzalez will defend at all 
costs, but reconciling, he said, the left's values with economic 
pragmatism. He also devoted an important section to championing 
the public sector as the driving force of some policies, 
especially in infrastructure projects and the services demanded 
by society. In this section he especially mentioned the aged, 
the underprivileged, and the environment. 
<H5>  Guerra's Applause </H5>
  Alfonso Guerra and the other Executive Committee members 
watched him closely. The deputy secretary general was the one 
who kept up his applause longest at the end of his old friend's 
speech. Moreover, once Gonzalez had taken his seat again and 
since the applause was continuing, Guerra, intent on all the 
details, as in the old days, urged him to stand up again in 
order to acknowledge it. 
  "At this congress we must prove to society that we are an 
open and lively party in constant touch with the public." "We 
must stanch the wounds because, if we reach agreement on how to 
set our house in order, the task which we have of offering 
society a blueprint of optimism and hope will be easier," 
Gonzalez said in his sole reference to party affairs. 
  Earlier, he defended the current policy of cooperation with 
"moderate nationalism," an allusion to CiU [Convergence and 
Union], and in his eagerness to integrate all viewpoints he 
asserted that the Socialists "are not giving up the idea of 
reaching agreements with United Left." Nevertheless, he omitted 
to mention the trade unions. 
<H5>  "Self-Criticism Is Not a Sign of Weakness" </H5>
  Felipe Gonzalez made an ardent parallel call for Socialist 
Party members' unity and for cohesion in Spanish society. And 
he told them both: "Self-criticism is not a sign of weakness." 
These are some of the most significant remarks in his speech: 
  Pragmatism -- "Any hope that is not founded on reality is in 
danger of being thwarted." 
  Renewal -- "There is nothing special about our coming to 
this 
congress talking about renewal, differing, and proclaiming that 
we are and wish to remain a party which makes the left's values 
a reality." 
  House in Order -- "If we reach agreement on how to set our 
house in order, the rest will be attainable. Let society 
perceive the renewal and openness." "We have three days to 
clarify ideas and stanch wounds, uniting wills...in order to 
cleanse and galvanize our morale, and in order to prepare 
ourselves and continue to work seriously for freedom, social 
welfare, and peace." 
  Criticism of People's Party -- "There is an opposition which 
says only `no,' `no,' and `no.'" 
  Praise of CiU -- "There has been no pressure or giving way. 
If this occurred some day, we would not give way in our 
convictions of cohesion and solidarity. The conduct is serious 
and responsible; more so than that of those who cry out against 
it in order to obstruct the government's work."

<F P=106> [Article signed AH/SN/HA: "Swiss Delegation Back From </F>
Kurdistan -- Export of Weapons Should Be Prohibited"; as 
released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Excerpt] Zurich, 29 Mar (ATS) -- The recent elections in 
Turkey were not free. This is the observation made by a Swiss 
delegation which came back after a 12-day monitoring mission. 
Given the "exceptional situation" prevailing in the country, 
the human rights were almost abolished, said the members of the 
team that was set up by the Switzerland-Kurdistan association. 
They gave a press conference on Tuesday [29 March] at the 
Zurich airport. 
  Twenty-three Swiss nationals were part of an international 
delegation to Kurdistan. Their objective was to ensure the 
safety of the civilian population during the Kurdish New Year 
celebrations on 21 March. They also intended to monitor the 
local Turkish elections during the week-end. 
  The members of the delegation were put under house arrest. 
The Turkish security services virtually prevented any contact 
with the population they said. 
<H5>  Banning the Export of Weapons </H5>
  The Swiss delegation has urged the Swiss authority to 
immediately ban the export of weapons to Turkey. It has also 
demanded that refugees from Kurdistan be no longer deported. 
Moreover, Switzerland must do everything possible to convince 
the parties involved in the conflict to negotiate. It was said 
that the eastern part of Anatolia is virtually under siege and 
one can easily imagine the consequences that this situation 
entails--mainly for the economy. 
  As far as the elections are concerned, many irregularities 
were noticeable, according to the Swiss delegation. They 
estimate that one fourth of the population was excluded from the 
poll in Kiziltepe. Many people were displaced. What is more, 
the presence of armed soldiers in the polling stations is said 
to have prevented the secrecy of the vote. In some places, 
ballot papers were missing. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Helsinki, March 25 (CTK) -- Finland's experience in 
trying to gain admission to the European Union [EU] illustrates 
membership is not a cure-all that brings only advantages, Czech 
Premier Vaclav Klaus declared today. 
  EU membership is a long-term investment which has its costs 
and at the beginning may be loss-making, he said. The Czech 
Republic must be aware it is a difficult process, be aware of 
possible pitfalls and prepare for entry with the help of 
specialists able to negotiate on EU admission, he told 
journalists during the first full day of his visit, which lasts 
until Sunday [27 March]. 
  Klaus pointed out that Finland's entry to the EU would, 
ironically, mean the end of its free trade agreement with the 
Czech Republic, which has lasted 20 years, and the limitation of 
mutual trade. 
  When asked to respond to Polish criticism that the Czech 
Republic is seeking EU entry ahead of the other members of the 
Visegrad Four -- Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- Klaus said, 
"Would Finland wait for, say, Norway if Helsinki could get into 
the EU before Oslo?... We ourselves could have reason to be 
disappointed that Warsaw did not consult us about submitting its 
official application for the EU," he said. 
  He said political developments in the Czech Republic would 
not follow the same course as in Poland, where reform communists 
have returned to power. He said in the Czech Republic the 
political situation was stable, the parties politically were 
clearly defined and the reforms had not provoked calls for a 
return to the past. 
  Klaus denied he was orientated to the West, saying he was 
"European." He said Europe should not demonize Russia, but 
expressed concern that the process of reform had all but stopped 
and that Russian foreign policy was now reflecting domestic 
problems.

  [Text] Helsinki, March 25 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic is 
the first post-communist country to enter the second phase of 
reform, the post-transformation stage, Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus said in a speech to the Paasikivi Society in Finland. 
  Klaus began his official visit on Thursday [24 March] and 
returns to the Czech Republic on Sunday. 
  The first phase, the transformation phase, includes all the 
basic reform measures. In the subsequent stage there are no 
visible new reforms but the reform process is deepened and 
improved. It is important to proceed with reform decisively and 
rapidly throughout, he said. 
  He recalled a paper he read at a UN conference in Finland on 
reforming centrally planned economies in June 1989 -- a few 
months before the anti-communist revolution in Czechoslovakia. 
His pre-revolutionary conclusions proved to be correct and were 
confirmed after the Velvet Revolution, he said. 
  The Paasikivi Society, named after the Finnish president of 
1946- 1956, was established in 1958 with the aim of developing 
the study of foreign policy and became a basis of the Finnish 
International Relations Institute. 
  Today Klaus also met Pertti Salolainen, the Finnish deputy 
premier and minister of foreign trade. Salolainen is the chief 
Finnish negotiator in talks with the European Union (EU), and 
consequently his talks today with Klaus focused chiefly on EU 
integration. 
  Salolainen said Finnish advice particularly on the EU's 
regional and agricultural policy could be very useful to the 
Czech Republic. In these areas Finland had had great 
difficulties adapting to the European system, he said. 
  Salolainen explained that his country's two main reasons for 
seeking EU membership were the possibility of developing closer 
links to West European security structures through economic 
integration, and secondly, psychologically, to assuage Finland's 
feeling of isolation after the other Scandinavian countries 
joined the EU. 
  The official part of Klaus's visit to Finland then ended 
with 
a ceremonial dinner held by Premier Esko Aho. 
  On Saturday morning Klaus and his wife will journey to 
Lapland to spend a private weekend deep in the arctic circle in 
Ivalo, where, well-informed sources say, he will drive snow 
scooters and ride an a reindeer sled.

  [Text] Helsinki, March 27 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus today ended his visit to Finland and left Helsinki aboard 
a plane for Prague. 
  His Friday [25 March] meeting with top Finnish 
representatives focused on Finnish experience concerning the 
process of entry of Finland to the European Union [European 
Union], something the Czech Republic would like to draw on when 
trying to join the EU. 
  At the meeting, Klaus repeated several times his belief that 
the Czech Republic would be the next new EU member. He received 
assurances from the Finns that Finland would back the Czech 
entry into the EU. 
  During the talks, both sides took position on the 
Partnership 
for Peace projects. Klaus said that the Czech Republic saw the 
project as a way to a full NATO membership, while Finnish 
Premier Esko Aho said his country was above all interested in 
peace-keeping operations under the project. 
  Both sides said there were no obstacles in the Czech-Finnish 
bilateral relations and expressed disappointment that the 
present bilateral free trade agreement would have to go as a 
result of Finland acquiring EU membership. They agreed, 
however, that mutually, all possible measures would be taken to 
offset possible repercussions of the changes. 
  On the weekend, Klaus visited Lapland in north Finland as 
the 
non-official part of his stay. Besides holding informal talks 
with Aho, Klaus availed himself of the opportunity to relax. 
  Finnish media gave Klaus's visit high profile, expressing 
admiration over the results of Czech economic transformation.

  [Text] Batman/Diyarbakir (DPA) -- Various German groups 
that are in Turkey to observe the Nevruz (spring) feast and the 
local elections, have made serious accusations against the 
Turkish security forces and the German Federal Government. 
  From Batman, five groups of the Humanistic Union reported 
that they had been detained in a hotel since Friday [25 March]; 
until Sunday they were not permitted to use the telephone. "In 
Batman, we were followed by special police units at every step. 
They wanted to prevent any contact with the population. Those 
who had contact with us (even bus and taxi drivers) were 
threatened with arrest, torture, and death." 
  The groups reported that, over the past year, more than 200 
persons were "killed by so-called unknown perpetrators (death 
squads controlled by the state)" in Batman. 
  From Diyarbakir, a group of unofficial observers, including 
Angelika Beer of the Federal Executive Committee of Alliance 
90/Greens, faxed a message saying that they noticed "that in 
southeastern Turkey/northern Kurdistan those who advocate 
democratic rights and rights of self-determination for the 
Kurdish population are threatened with mass arrest, torture, and 
even death." Therefore, the signatories called on the Federal 
Government to "immediately stop any kind of deportation and 
expulsion of Turkish Kurds." 
  Like the Humanistic Union, the Society for Endangered 
Peoples 
(GfvB) also accused the Federal Government of supporting the war 
against the Kurds by means of arms deliveries. From 1985-91 
alone, Bonn delivered armament goods worth 3.6 billion German 
marks to Turkey, GfbV Chairman Tilmann Zuelch said in Bonn on 
Monday. "Unfortunately, the relentless civil war is also a 
consequence of German policy."

Biggest Challenges Facing Late 20th Century"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Istanbul, 29 Mar (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes stressed on Tuesday [29 March] the importance of the 
challenge posed to the modern world by the rise of Muslim 
fundamentalism, believing increased economic cooperation to be 
the best response. 
  Commenting on the favorable results achieved by the Welfare 
Party [RP], especially in certain large cities such as Istanbul 
and Ankara, at Sunday's local elections in Turkey, Mr. Claes 
stressed that religious fundamentalism was "one of the greatest 
challenges facing the West in this late 20th century." 
  "I believe, however, that this rise of fundamentalist 
parties 
does not only reflect a surge in Muslim religious fervor, but 
also draws upon the despair of young generations afflicted by 
the economic and social crisis," the Belgian minister added. 
  He believes the best response to be an increase in economic 
cooperation with countries suffering from a difficult economic 
situation. 
  "Greater solidarity is needed, but I find unfortunately that 
charity is increasingly being used as an excuse for reducing 
this aid," he concluded.

Claes: `No Ban on Kurdish Organizations in Belgium'"; as 
released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Ankara, 28 Mar (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes dismissed the idea of banning organizations such as 
the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) in Belgium, as Turkey is 
implicitly demanding. 
  Mr. Claes, after meeting with Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel, stated: "As long as the Kurdish organizations respect 
the rules of democracy in Belgium, we will not ban them." 
  Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin had implicitly 
criticized Belgium for allowing groups close to the PKK to 
operate on its territory while they are banned in France and 
Germany. 
  Mr. Claes further explained: "We doubt considerably the 
effectiveness of a ban insofar as when you ban one organization 
this immediately leads to the creation of another sister 
organization going under a different name or even drives the 
organization underground." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Excerpts] A grim-faced John Major endured one of the 
darkest hours of his premiership today, facing a furious Commons 
after the Cabinet's acceptance of a compromise in the row over 
Britain's voting powers in an enlarged European Union [EU]. 
  His worst moment came when Tory maverick back-bencher Tony 
Marlow sent a shudder through the Chamber with a stark public 
demand that he should quit Downing Street and make way for 
someone who would provide leadership. [passage omitted] 
  The Commons storm -- one of the most savage for months -- 
was the climax of a dramatic day during which the Cabinet faced 
an ultimatum to respond by six o'clock tonight to a compromise 
plan drawn up by the Greeks who hold the EU presidency. 
  And in Brussels tonight, European Commission President 
Jacques Delors poured cold water on Mr Major's claims of new 
concessions by the EU as a "sweetener" in the battle over voting 
rights. He said he had simply clarified, at Britain's request, 
the Commission's interpretation of Euro-social policy. 
  And Irish Commissioner Padraig Flynn insisted that no 
concessions of any kind had been approved to soften the blow to 
Britain of conceding more voting rights to Brussels. 
  Now Tory Euro-critics are on the warpath again, egged on by 
Mr Marlow, as the Government -- after talking tough only a week 
ago -- appears to be bending the knee to the Brussels 
bureaucracy machine. [passage omitted] 
  Mr Major's already insecure position, almost certainly the 
biggest threat to his leadership since he swept to power, was 
made worse by denials in Brussels that Britain had been given 
guarantees overnight that no social legislation would be sneaked 
in "by the back door." 
  Mr Delors, asked if anything had changed as a result of 
talks 
with the British Government, replied: "No, no. I simply 
clarified the programme of the Commission for the present year 
and also the interpretation of the social protocol, that is all." 
  Mr Flynn said: "There was no such concession or change in 
policy." He went on: "Nothing of that nature could take place 
without my agreement and my agreement was neither sought nor 
given." 
  Commission officials were pointing out tonight that even if 
concessions had been given they would apply only to 1994 -- and 
the voting changes which would be affected by any concessions do 
not come in until 1995. 
  Mr Delors made it clear that he, presiding over a Commission 
which stands down at the end of this year, could not make any 
special arrangements with Britain which would bind a future 
Commission. 
  But Downing Street officials later repudiated the denial of 
any guarantees, producing documents to say that these 
undertakings had in fact been given. 
  The Prime Minister, who looked distinctly uncomfortable 
during the Commons exchanges, bluntly told Mr Smith: "What you 
appear to have overlooked is that we have achieved a series of 
concessions that would not have been available if we had adopted 
your position of accepting, without let or hindrance, 27 for all 
areas immediately. 
  ``We have not achieved the maintenance of the blocking 
majority of 23. I would have ideally preferred that. But 
neither have the other member states achieved what they would 
have wished -- for we have obtained concessions particularly 
that protect our most vulnerable flank on social affairs.'' 
  Michael Heseltine, who is fast becoming the favourite to 
succeed Mr Major, airily brushed aside any thoughts of a 
challenge from him in the autumn. "We've been over that ground 
and I'm bored to distraction by it," he told Channel 4 News. 
  He claimed there was widespread support for Mr Major, 
saying: 
"I saw it demonstrated extremely eloquently in Plymouth where 
there were hundreds of Conservatives gathered for a very 
successful conference on Saturday. I have not the slightest 
doubt that that is testimony to what the party and the country 
thinks, and I have not the slightest doubt that the party and 
the House of Commons is determined to back the Prime Minister 
and the Foreign Secetary on what has been a difficult, hard 
fought negotiation." 
  The President of the Board of Trade denied the Government 
had 
given in over its battle with the EU. 
  He said: "It is a detailed negotiation in which Douglas Hurd 
has won a commendable negotiating success in British interests, 
and the only party that fought that battle was the Conservative 
Party." 
  But many Tories feel that John Major has himself created a 
personal crisis by building up expectations of a bitter battle 
with Brussels over voting rights -- and then not fulfilling them. 
  And in Westminster tonight, some furious Tory backbenchers 
believe the Prime Minister has bound a future British government 
to a European Union with ever-increasing legal authority over a 
sovereign power.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hip Holster on the Right Side"] </F>
  [Text] The diplomat from Damascus did not attach any 
importance to protocol and a reception befitting his rank. The 
office manager for the Syrian vice president overmodestly 
pretended to be first secretary of the embassy in Prague when he 
filled in the immigration card at Budapest Airport. He provided 
the following as the purpose of his trip: "tourism." 
  However, Nabil Sharitah, 44, was aware that he would not 
have 
any time for the view of the Danube in room 214 of the Forum 
Hotel. An envoy of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) 
expected him there for a conspiratorial meeting. 
  The West German agent forced his partner in the discussion 
to 
come to Budapest by threatening to disclose various things in 
the Syrian's eventful life. There the BND man, who had also 
brought an official of the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigation (BKA) with him, sharply interrogated the Arab. 
  After a nervous breakdown, Sharitah signed a paper: "I 
declare that I will fly to Germany of my own free will." 
  The interest of German authorities in the Syrian diplomat is 
understandable. Sharitah, who was arrested in Berlin in January 
after he had entered the country, is the key figure in 
spectacular proceedings concerning international terrorism in 
Berlin. And he is better aware than most people of his 
government's cordial relations with a man who is hunted all over 
the world: Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, called "Carlos." 
  Top terrorist Carlos, 44, whose bloody trail leads from the 
attack on the Vienna OPEC conference in 1975 (three deaths) to 
the bomb attack on the Marseilles central station in 1983 (four 
deaths), also pulled the strings for an attack on the French 
cultural center Maison de France in Berlin on 25 August 1983. 
German Johannes Weinrich, 46, Carlos' right-hand man, had 
delivered the material for the bomb, nitropenta plastic 
explosive, to East Berlin. 
  And the gray gentlemen from the Stasi also participated. 
First, they took the explosive consignment away from Weinrich, 
but they returned it to him after some hesitation. Stasi 
Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, who is today 51 years old and 
is charged with aiding and abetting murder by a grand criminal 
division of the Berlin Land Court, was responsible for it. Last 
week, the public prosecutor demanded four and a half years' 
imprisonment; the sentence is expected before Easter. 
  Shahritah, who was the third secretary of the Syrian Embassy 
in East Berlin at that time, also provided assistance for the 
terrorist attack. Weinrich first stored his bomb materiel in 
Sharitah's workroom. A cache from Carlos' group -- with Italian 
submachine guns, electrical fuzes, and 6,100 rounds of 
ammunition for 9 mm self-loading weapons -- had been there for 
years. 
  The diplomat had been instructed by a very high official 
that 
he should be at the service of Carlos' gang. The intelligence 
service of the Syrian Air Force had ordered through official 
channels via the Foreign Ministry in Damascus that the 
desperados "be helped in any way possible." 
  Embassy Councillor Sharitah's support for Carlos has gotten 
him charged with having aided and abetted murder and caused a 
bomb explosion. However, more than 10 years after the deed, the 
legal assessment of the bloody attack is in danger of being lost 
in a tangle of agents' games and diplomatic tactics. 
  Syria, which has been notorious as a godfather of 
international terrorism for years, is playing a key role in the 
peaceful solution being pursued in the Middle East. Last week, 
during a visit to Bonn, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' 
stated ambiguously that German-Syrian relations must not be 
clouded by the Berlin lawsuit. 
  However, FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic 
Party of Germany) gave the Syrians the brush-off: Lawsuits are 
"exclusively the courts' business in the rule-of-law state of 
Germany." 
  It has not yet been finally clarified how and why Sharitah, 
for whom a German arrest warrant was issued only in the autumn 
of 1993, gave himself up to the Berlin judiciary at all. There 
are many indications of dilletantism and questionable forgery 
practices by German services during the operation. 
  According to the most plausible version, an Arab BND member 
got in touch with Sharitah by telephone from southern Europe. 
It was the BND's priority interest to investigate Carlos and 
Weinrich's habitat. The two terrorists were granted asylum in 
Damascus. Since October 1992, Bonn has been demanding their 
extradition from Syria through verbal note 549. 
  Now, pressure that is more common in this line of business 
was supposed to help. The German security authorities evaluated 
comprehensive documents that had been accumulated on Sharitah; 
among them were details on possible compromising contacts. 
  Apparently the material was enough to force Sharitah to 
participate in the meeting in Budapest. However, he claims that 
he came voluntarily, "for private reasons," to the Hungarian 
capital. 
  As an investigator reported, the Syrian's interrogation, 
which took hours, ended in dissent between the police and the 
agent. The BKA official wanted to transfer the accused to 
Germany, while the BND agent advocated a "professional" 
solution: Sharitah should spy for the Germans from Damascus. 
  According to the investigator, another idea only took shape 
when Sharitah had been "completely broken down" in the 
interrogation: The Syrian should travel to Germany and give 
himself up there. 
  First of all, however, the papers necessary to do this were 
lacking. Sharitah only had a diplomatic visa (15305005) for a 
visit to the FRG, which was not yet stamped "invalid," but had 
expired on 17 May 1993. In the hotel room the last figure was 
removed "with a razor blade" and replaced with a 4, an 
investigator reported. 
  However, the controllers at Budapest Airport became 
suspicious. Therefore, the conspiratorial trio did not fly, as 
planned, to Berlin right away. Only then, this time with the 
help of the local BKA resident responsible for drug searches, 
and the embassy, did they procure a regular visa. It was issued 
on 7 January 1994. 
  The BKA refuses to provide any information on that. 
However, last Friday [25 March] the Foreign Ministry in Bonn 
confirmed to DER SPIEGEL, which has a copy of the relevant visa, 
that the visa had actually become invalid in 1993. The Berlin 
judiciary is currently holding onto the doctored diplomatic 
passport. 
  Berlin Senior Public Prosecutor Detlev Mehlis ("Nobody 
dragged him here in a box") feared that the lives of Sharitah 
and his family were in "serious danger." Therefore, seven weeks 
ago, the principal witness in the lawsuit dealing with the 
attack on the Maison de France was only permitted to give 
evidence hidden behind a screen and the courtroom in Moabit 
resembled a fortress. 
  While Sharitah initially feared for his life, a surprising 
change -- mysterious Orient -- has now occurred. After a visit 
to his cell by the Syrian ambassador, principal witness Sharitah 
pretends to know nothing about the Syrians' terrorist 
connection. Now he is expressing his latest insight to judges 
and public prosecutors: "Syria is combating terrorism." At any 
rate, he never saw Carlos and Weinrich again in Damascus, he 
said. 
  This fits in with the official version that the Syrian 
foreign minister presented to his Bonn counterpart Kinkel the 
week before last. Accordingly, the two terrorists left the 
country long ago -- for Aden in Yemen or Tripoli in Libya. 
  However, according to the BKA files of the investigations, 
Carlos and his German companion are still very well-known in 
Damascus -- even in the German Embassy. 
  According to these documents, Weinrich, who has a fleet of 
eight Mercedes limousines in the Syrian capital, always tries to 
be near his compatriots. In 1991 he still made merry at the 
Lufthansa Oktoberfest in the Sheraton and he appeared almost 
daily in the hotel's pub. 
  A Mercedes major account manager also invited Weinrich, who 
called himself "Peter Schmidt" at that time, to his home -- 
diplomats made merry together with them. A witness said: "I 
have to proceed on the assumption that Schmidt is also very 
well-known to German Embassy personnel." 
  Reportedly, bon vivant Weinrich, who, according to the 
witness, always carries a gun in a "hip holster on his right 
side," even presented comrade-in-arms Carlos a Mercedes and 
introduced him with the following words: "This is my boss." 
German businessmen also spotted the two top terrorists again 
and again at the Sheraton bar. 
  In the summer of 1991, two BKA officers traveled to Damascus 
to finally find out for certain. A Mercedes employee was to 
procure Weinrich's fingerprints. 
  The attempt was successful. "In order to comply with my duty 
as a citizen," the businessmen recovered an empty pack of Lucky 
Strike cigarettes that the terrorist had thrown into the 
wastepaper basket. "Peter Schmidt's" fingerprints removed the 
last doubts: They were those of Johannes Weinrich. 
  The evidence on Mr. Schmidt's life is also piling up with 
the 
Berlin police. Last July, Weinrich was still seen in Damascus. 
There he went about his daily business undisturbed, although 
Kinkel's Foreign Ministry had briefed the Syrians on the 
contents of the BKA reports long ago. 
  Public Prosecutor Mehlis passed the findings on to the land 
court. In his accompanying letter, he announced resignedly 
that, in addition, he would make them accessible to the Foreign 
Ministry, "in order to gain support for the local request for 
Weinrich's deportation" -- "although it seems to me that the 
result is a foregone conclusion."

<F P=106> ["deu" report: "Put Kurds on Trial Here"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- A controversy over the treatment of the 
Kurds who committed crimes during demonstrations last week is 
emerging in the Federal Government. In contrast to Interior 
Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union), Justice 
Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (Free Democratic 
Party of Germany) rejects a speedy deportation of the people 
concerned to Turkey. The minister also expressed doubts about 
the sense of a German-Turkish agreement, which Kanther demands. 
By this agreement Ankara is supposed to commit itself once 
again to not torturing deported Kurdish criminals or sentencing 
them to death. 
  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said on Monday [28 March] that 
Turkey has long joined several agreements "that say torture is 
not permitted. This shows that Turkey has obligations arising 
from these agreements." Therefore, a Justice Ministry spokesman 
expressed skepticism about a talk, which is to be held by the 
Justice Ministry, the Interior Ministry, as well as the Foreign 
Ministry on the agreement today, Tuesday. 
  In an interview, the justice minister called for putting 
Kurdish criminals on trial in Germany. No one must be deported 
to a country where he is "really threatened" with torture and 
the death penalty. The Justice Ministry spokesman explained that 
this is "the ultimate limit" for Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger. 
Hans Gottfried Bernrath, Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD], chairman of the Bundestag Internal Affairs Committee, 
also called for trying the Kurdish criminals in Germany. Only 
afterwards should a deportation be decided on. 
  The Interior Ministry played down reports that, on the 
weekend, it considered flying Federal Border Police units to the 
Kurdish demonstrations in Bundeswehr helicopters. Such 
considerations are only made in general and apply to really 
exceptional situations within the framework of administrative 
assistance. In no case does this mean the use of soldiers, but 
only the provision of Air Force transport planes, the Interior 
Ministry said. 
  Several SPD politicians once again came out in favor of the 
immediate cessation of German arms exports to Turkey. There are 
indications that Ankara does use the weapons against Kurds, in 
contrast to its reassurances. A Foreign Ministry spokesman 
stressed that German diplomats have not learned about the use of 
weapons from Germany against Kurds so far. However, it was said 
in the Defense Ministry that Bonn does "not have any possibility 
of checking this in Turkey itself."

<F P=106> [Eugen Georg Schwarz report: "Kohl Is Catching Up"] </F>
  [Text] In the past, when there was only one television 
channel, the television directors bridged half-time breaks in 
soccer matches by showing a lion in the goal, at first sleeping 
peacefully, then slowly awakening, stretching, readying itself 
to leap as soon as the whistle sounded for the second half. 
Helmut Kohl reminds us of this television lion of the past. 
  The chancellor seems to be at the stage of awakening. In 
March, 31 percent of the Germans would have elected him 
chancellor in direct elections, which is 7 percent more than in 
February. Challenger Rudolf Scharping, who has looked like the 
sure winner of the next Bundestag elections for many months, 
lost a sensational 8 percentage points (52:44). 
  Also, regarding questions by Basis Research for FOCUS about 
the assessment of the desired qualities of a chancellor, Kohl 
caught up and Scharping lost. The only big problem is still the 
"pleasant personality" of the man from Palatinate. "The advice 
of Peter Boenisch alone, that the old man should not wear 
glasses anymore, is probably not sufficient," an assistant image 
polisher in Bonn's Konrad-Adenauer House said. 
  Even though the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] will have 
to 
beware of breaking into cheers, one cannot speak of a change in 
the trend away from the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
and toward the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU], either. 
However, the general political climate has improved slightly 
for Kohl and his team -- but mainly in the west. 
  Whether this is due to the chancellor's appearance at the 
Hamburg party congress; to his policy statement, which was 
generally received positively there; or to Rudolf Scharping's 
not very straight course of the past weeks (tax policy, 
nursing-care insurance) remains to be seen. 
  Asked about the better government team and the competence in 
solving the most important questions, the CDU/CSU is, quite 
certainly, catching up to a considerable extent. 
  While in February only 26 percent of those polled decided in 
favor of the coalition as the better team (SPD: 41 percent), the 
Scharping team's lead has shrunk to 36:33 four weeks later. In 
the west, the ratio was even equal. Here, the CDU/CSU and the 
SPD received 36 percent each as the better government team 
(CDU/CSU plus 9 percentage points, SPD minus 5 percentage 
points). 
  However, if the point is who is more competent to solve the 
most important political problems, the SPD is still clearly 
ahead of the Christian-Liberal coalition. In March, 28 percent 
counted on the current Federal Government (in January and 
February 24 percent each); 38 percent (in January 39 percent, in 
February 46 percent) thought the SPD would be more competent as 
a government party. Even though Kohl and his team regained the 
lead in competence, the quarrel regarding economic policy, 
internal security, and price stability, Scharping's team 
continues to dominate in all other political fields. 
  Seven months before the Bundestag elections in October, the 
decision has not been made by far. A considerable part of the 
voters -- in the east and the west -- are unsure which 
government they actually want and whom they are supposed to vote 
for. 
  This becomes clear from the answers to question: "Which 
Federal Government do you expect after the elections?" A total 
of 21 percent (in January 20 percent, in February 18 percent) 
believe in a coalition with a CDU/CSU leadership or a CDU/CSU 
solo government. A total of 40 percent favor an SPD-led 
coalition or an SPD absolute majority (in January 37 percent, in 
February 49 percent). 
  However, despite this seemingly big lead, the SPD's victory 
is not at all certain. An employee of Basis Research says: 
"Only when such a poll yields more than 60 percent for a 
certain party or a certain coalition, one can say for sure: The 
decision has been made." Uncertainty over voting behavior still 
reigns in particular in the new laender. Even though, just as 
in the west, here, too, only one out of four says: "I do not 
know whom to vote for." However, asked "How certain is your 
current decision for the elections?" only 53 percent say: "I 
would certainly vote for the party I mentioned." 
  In the old laender, 74 percent are certain, which 
corresponds 
to a federal average of 69 percent. Public opinion researchers 
register firm links with the parties only as of 80 percent of 
decisionmaking certainty. 
  The silver lining on the dark CDU/CSU horizon also gives 
rise 
to hope in the chancellor's office when the question is asked of 
how voters would decide if the elections were held next Sunday. 
In March the CDU/CSU gained 12 percentage points and now has 36 
percent. The SPD goes down from 39 to 38 percent, the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] from 8.5 to 7 percent, 
Alliance 90/Greens from 9.5 to 9 percent. Honecker's heirs, the 
Party of Democratic Socialism, is still elected by 4 percent. 
The Republikaner go up from 3.5 to 4 percent, the others from 
1.5 to 2 percent. The Instead Party and similar parties do not 
have any chance of entering the next Bundestag. 
  After the disaster in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, 
things are obviously getting problematic for the FDP, also at 
the federal level. The raw figures of the March poll, which 
primarily reflect the general mood, see the FDP at only 6 
percent. Even though this result rises to 7 percent after 
additional calculations, already now the FOCUS Political Compass 
indicates that the FDP will not get over the 5-percent threshold 
with its regular voters alone. It must commit itself to a 
coalition statement, because it will need coalition votes. 
  The CDU/CSU cannot be indifferent toward the fate of the 
FDP. 
If the coalition partner fails, the CDU/CSU's prospects to 
remain in power go down to zero. Then even an absolute SPD 
majority would be possible, just as in Lower Saxony.

<F P=106> ["evo" report: "SPD Is on the Wrong Track"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], has called the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] government program "dubious." 
It does not permit one to see any basic position on economic 
policy, he said after a meeting of the FDP Presidium. The SPD 
lacks at least 8 billion German marks to implement its plans, 
because investment subsidies or raising children's allowances 
have an effect on the costs. In addition, it is not made clear 
how the SPD wants to reduce expenditures for personnel and 
defense. 
  FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel criticized the "demonization" of 
high-wage earners; the SPD is "on the wrong track concerning tax 
and financial policy." "In the foreseeable future," Kinkel 
said, the liberals want to make a decision on the coalition 
statement. During the weekend Rexrodt suggested that a 
coalition statement should be made at the federal congress in 
Rostock in June; originally it had been planned for the election 
congress in September. 
  The Presidium supported the Brandenburg FDP leaders, who, 
after the failure of the coalition between SPD, FDP, and Greens, 
are the only party that rejects a self-dissolution of the 
Potsdam Landtag and early new elections. The FDP in Brandenburg 
will not "let itself be bent," Kinkel said. Referring to the 
intervention of the federal Christian Democratic Union [CDU], 
which has urged the Brandenburg CDU to hold new elections, the 
FDP federal chairman said that he does not think anything of 
"remote control."

<F P=106> [Article by Franz Sommerfeld: "Not So Much a Gambler as an </F>
Upright Swabian"] 
  [Text] The Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is 
stumbling into the most severe crisis of its history this super 
election year. The party is headed by Klaus Kinkel, a 
politician whom party colleagues and opponents alike consider to 
be overstrained. 
  Things are not easy for Klaus Kinkel. Each week brings a new 
disaster. The FDP chairman still had not recovered from his 
party's election defeats in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein 
when he was confronted with new problems: Next weekend, the 
expansion of the European Union [EU] might fail for the time 
being. While flying from Moscow to Paris last week, domestic 
horror reports reached the foreign minister. If elections are 
held in Potsdam in June, then his party will face the next fall 
below the magic 5 percent. 
<H5>  Rumbustious Ventriloquist </H5>
  In the view of leading FDP politicians, Kinkel is 
responsible 
for many crises. Under Genscher, the disaster in Lower Saxony 
would have been avoided. "Genscher," one of the politicians 
says, "would have guided the Lower Saxons toward a 
social-liberal coalition right from the beginning. With the 
slogan of preventing a red-green coalition or Schroeder's solo 
government, they would have entered the Landtag. However, 
turning half-heartedly toward the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] eight days before the elections just looks like 
opportunism." Genscher led the party, even when Lambsdorff was 
already chairman. But Kinkel, the accusation says, does not 
lead, but just lets business run along. When he reacts, he is 
rambunctious. 
  "A rambunctious ventriloquist," a Foreign Ministry official 
says mockingly, referring to the appearances of his supreme 
boss. Some top officials have already asked for transfers to 
German embassies abroad. They dislike the German foreign 
minister's inclination to pursue policy more with his guts than 
with his mind. Kinkel likes pounding the table. Last Wednesday 
[23 March], he elevated the return of the cultural assets 
captured during World War II "to a test" of German-Russian 
relations and energetically threatened with "unfavorable" 
strains on "overall relations." 
<H5>  Quickly Offended </H5>
  The German foreign minister often threatens: He wanted to 
force the Serbs to their knees; he wanted to break the neck of 
the Spanish if they delay the accession of the new members of 
the EU. Later denials are ineffective. What emanated the 
modest charm of youthful recklessness at the beginning of his 
term of office is just embarrassing now. 
  The man is quickly offended, especially about the press' 
scolding of politicians, but also by other countries. He had 
the French ambassador summoned to the Foreign Ministry because 
of some critical remarks and thus inflated a comment by a 
diplomat into a German-French affair. Christian Social Union 
[CSU] and Christian Democratic Union [CDU] politicians are 
ridiculing the "foreign minister's old fashioned Swabian ways." 
SPD Bundestag Group Chairman Klose politely recommended 
speaking German and not Swabian at international negotiations 
because the dialect is a bit coarse. On top of everything else, 
Kinkel yesterday had to apologize in the French newspaper LE 
MONDE. 
  Two years after assuming office, the foreign minister has 
largely gambled away his party's most important asset -- namely 
the FDP's foreign policy reputation linked with the name of 
Genscher. Certainly, Genscher left a lot of unsolved problems to 
his successor. However, in contrast to Kinkel, Genscher had 
ideas and visions that went beyond the specific day. They were 
often indefinite. Genscher loved to keep as many paths as 
possible open, to let developments mature and then give them the 
final kick. Kinkel, who is a doctor of jurisprudence, on the 
other hand, looks for legal positions in the political business. 
Where Genscher knew how to implement German interests with as 
little noise as possible, Kinkel is loudly calling for a German 
seat on the UN Security Council. 
<H5>  Quarrel About Rau </H5>
  At Whitsun, when the German president will be elected in the 
Reichstag building, Kinkel will be facing the next crisis. The 
FDP chairman wants to vote for CDU candidate Roman Herzog on the 
third ballot. In contrast, the strong North Rhine-Westphalian 
FDP wants to vote for Rau. Leading FDP members also expect FDP 
candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher to give a restrained 
recommendation for Rau. For instance, she could recommend her 
electors after the second ballot to make their decision 
independent of the yoke of coalition discipline. Thus, she 
would speak for Rau. 
  By voting for Herzog, Kinkel wants to give a signal for the 
FDP's reliability as a partner for the CDU/CSU. His opponents 
in the party clearly want to stress the party's independence. 
The election will give a signal in any case -- that of Kinkel's 
weakness as a leader. 
  The old liberal Gerhart Baum criticizes the FDP for often 
lacking inner independence: "In the FDP, there are so-called 
coalition liberals, who can only imagine a coalition with the 
CDU/CSU." In the inner circle around Kinkel and Bundestag Group 
Chairman Solms, the decision has long been on a coalition 
statement in favor of the CDU/CSU. 
  At least, upon Genscher's urging, Kinkel seems to have 
decided not to have the coalition statement for the CDU/CSU 
adopted at the next party congress in Rostock in June. Genscher 
has always been proud of keeping his changing chancellors at 
least a bit uncertain. The old fox wants to keep the FDP open as 
a partner for both big parties as long as possible. The 
honorary FDP chairman was the first one in the party to say that 
the CDU/CSU and the chancellor cannot be expected to achieve 
much anymore. 
  However, all that need not bother the party chairman. No 
one will replace Kinkel -- not in the election campaign and not 
afterwards either, because the fear of a red-green coalition, 
which will increase until autumn, will once again drive the FDP 
over the 5-percent threshold in the Bundestag. Scharping will 
save it. He prefers a coalition with the government-experienced 
FDP over a red-green coalition with all its uncertainties. 
Business circles are already supporting the FDP in order to 
place it at Scharping's side if the SPD wins. Thus, the FDP has 
every chance of remaining a government party. 
<H5>  Sacrifice </H5>
  There is something else, however, that indicates favorable 
prospects for the liberals on the political scene. Liberal 
values, such as individual responsibility, a turning away from 
"Father State," and market economy are gaining weight and are as 
undisputed as hardly ever in Germany's past. However, Kinkel is 
not the man to seize this opportunity. 
  Kinkel's problem is that he has not really accepted his new 
office. How else could one explain that he still speaks of 
having almost concluded a contract with an industrial company in 
1990? Why is he not embarrassed when he embellishes his dream 
of being a manager with the remark that he would have earned 
more money in industry? And, of course, he also has to mention 
that his family advised him against politics at that time. So 
much talk in this form shows that Klaus Kinkel sees his rise to 
the top offices of the republic as a sacrifice. Genscher 
enjoyed being a politician. 
<H5>  A Bit of Adventurous Spirit </H5>
  Kinkel's monomania of leading his party only out of 
responsibility -- and not because he enjoys power -- is a 
hindrance for him. In this super election year, Kinkel would at 
least have to open his party's door a little bit for changing 
partners -- as Scheel and Genscher did before him. However, a 
change in partners requires courage, imagination, and a bit of 
adventurous spirit, as well as a bit of a gambling nature. The 
upright Swabian is lacking all that. 
  "He has gotten used to the jogging pace of government work," 
an FDP insider says. "This provides a special artificial 
security removed from the real development. The slogan is: 
Everything continues in Bonn's government business. Why should 
it not do so after the elections?"

<F P=106> [Article by Klaus-Peter Schoeppner, managing director of the </F>
Emnid Opinion Research Institute in Bielefeld: "The Mistakes 
Made by the Union Parties and the Form Of the Day of the SPD"] 
  [Text] Exclusively on behalf of the BERLINER ZEITUNG, 
the Emnid Opinion Research Institute, at monthly intervals, 
prepares compilations of significant trends and relevant opinion 
research data. 
  Enough of all the talk, election promises, and verbal 
attacks. It's time to vote. But when super election year 1994 
kicks off on 13 March with the Lower Saxon Landtag election, the 
parties will leave their starting blocks on a very unequal basis. 
  What is certain is that only the SPD [Social Democratic 
Party 
of Germany] has been able to maneuver itself into a favorable 
starting position. But only because the Republikaner, following 
a good start, have gone into a tailspin, and the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Democratic Union/ Christian Social Union], as well as 
the Alliance 90/Greens, are almost still in their starting 
blocks. 
  At a time when the importance of fundamental party concepts 
for deciding the outcome of elections is declining, when 
confidence in authority has been lost, when CDU and SPD become 
interchangeable, and the percentage of hard-core voters who will 
remain loyal to a particular party is dropping, likableness and 
the political climate take on additional significance. The party 
on top, prestigewise, suddenly seems to be in much better shape 
than would follow from its share of the voters. 
<H5>  Personal Liking Will Be Decisive </H5>
  Particularly the easily influenced, politically 
disinterested, and indecisive voters base their decision on the 
form of the day. As many as 5 percentage points of votes gained 
or lost can easily be the result of the political mood. 
  And this mood is, if anything, favorable for the SPD at the 
moment, while being unfavorable for the governing coalition in 
Bonn. Forty-nine percent of those polled see Scharping's party 
[the SPD] in front in February 1994, only 18 percent the 
CDU/CSU. The approval rate of the Republikaner has clearly gone 
down. Prior to the onset of the election marathon, Schoenhuber's 
amorphous scare slogans become ever less entrancing. The FDP 
[Free Democratic Party], but also the Alliance 90/Greens, have 
been fighting a headwind for some time already. 
  The state of low esteem of the Union parties has now lasted 
almost three years. Scharping, on the other hand, following the 
loss of esteem caused by the Engholm resignation, has gradually 
brought his party back to smoother waters. But the SPD's 
passable form of the day still seems to be based more on the 
contrast that it presents to the mistakes of the Union than on 
the high esteem in which the opposition party in Bonn is held. 
Only a little less than half the people entitled to vote (46 
percent) consider it capable of taking over the government. A 
majority (55 percent) is still dissatisfied with the 
challengers. All signs seem to point to a basic position of the 
electorate, viz. that he who does nothing also runs no risk of 
doing anything wrong. 
  That could be risky, however. It took only three months 
following the 1990 election for the standing of the Union 
parties to drop into the cellar. The SPD had a similar 
experience after the Engholm affair, but it recovered just as 
quickly. Although 63 percent, more than at any time since 
mid-1991, expect to see a red-green election victory, the SPD, 
by the time of the election, can still run into difficulties to 
the extent that the Union parties succeed in demanding that the 
SPD take a clear position with respect to personalities and its 
program. 
<H5>  Voters Frightened Off </H5>
  It is the coalition question which will most likely become 
the acid test for the SPD. The majority of voters currently 
prefer above all the grand coalition which is so highly 
unpopular in SPD circles. SPD supporters, on the other hand, 
want a red-green coalition, a model for governing which not even 
20 percent of those entitled to vote support. The SPD will 
preserve its competence for having a decent plan to deal with 
unemployment, currently the most important political task, only 
as long as it does not have to give consideration to the 
probable coalition partner Alliance 90/Greens. Regardless of the 
SPD's decision in the coalition question, a large number of 
voters and sympathizers will be frightened off in any case. 
<H5>  Change Remains Permanent </H5>
  The more the election takes on the characteristics of a 
protest election, the greater will be the prospects for success 
of the little parties. There have been increased indications 
since February, however, that repudiations of the established 
parties have decreased in number. More and more people are 
realizing that many splinter parties have little more to offer 
than nice-sounding words. Accordingly, the number of nonvoters 
has been going down continuously since the beginning of the year. 
  At this point, only every tenth German still feels that the 
Republikaner pursue "democratic" goals. Without a solid voter 
base in the west, the chances of the PDS [Party of Democratic 
Socialism] remain doubtful. Only a party along the lines of the 
"Instead" [Statt] Party could spring a surprise. But here too 
the percentage of Germans belonging to the broader circle of 
sympathizers of this party has declined from 60 to 30 percent. 
  As of the beginning of 1994, only 16 percent of Germans are 
still dedicated supporters of their party, and, seven months 
before the Bundestag election, not even 50 percent know yet how 
they will vote. 
  Against this background, there is still room for migrations 
of the electorate. For that reason, in election year 1994, the 
slogan of the political parties at this low point in the 
political atmosphere is, as never before: Nothing is more 
permanent than change.

<F P=106> [Article by Udo Bergdoll: "The Superiority of the Gentle </F>
Smile; An Astounding Self-Confidence Helps Economics Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt Avoid Being Distracted by Criticism of His 
Performance"] 
  [Text] Whatever they are saying about him--that he is 
looking for, but unable to find, a distinctive personal image 
for himself; that even after 13 months in office, he has 
remained an outsider in Bonn's political machine; that, for the 
public, he has remained an unknown--Guenter Rexrodt accepts all 
of it with the gentle smile of superiority. He does not mind if 
people, who want to make a name for themselves at his expense, 
claim that he has also remained in the shadow of his 
pre(pre-pre-pre)cursor Otto Count Lambsdorff. He is in 
fact--unlike the sequence of Bangemann, Haussmann, Moellemann--a 
true expert in his job as federal economics minister. Never mind 
that they accuse him of talking a lot of hot air, while showing 
little action; that the industrial leaders are more interested 
in Rudolf Scharping's understanding of the industrial world than 
in his. Guenter Rexroadt can apparently live with that. "I am 
very satisfied with my degree of fame," he says, getting rid of 
any doubt. "In their first years, neither Kohl nor Genscher were 
any better known." 
  Those who have failed to notice it, pay attention: This man, 
who at one point used to be Berlin's finance senator, who then 
worked as a banker and served in the Trust Agency as manager, is 
pursuing certain goals in his political life. The successor of 
Ludwig Erhard and Karl Schiller believes that he is the right 
man for the right time; somebody who has an easy understanding 
of the "revolutionary changes" Germany has undergone and who 
knows exactly what way things are going; who will know how to 
make himself heard without saying what people want to hear, 
"without any demagogy." He "only wants to tell the truth," 
regardless of how painful it is. "Even in Bonn, where I am more 
and more accepted," the minister, who in no way wants to fit in 
with the other members of Helmut Kohl's cabinet, states without 
false modesty. 
  But who is Guenter Rexrodt? Even his critics have no doubt 
that he knows what keeps the show going, that he has enough 
ideas on how to rescue the German economy from bankruptcy. 
However, is this economics minister a politician as well? Is he 
patient enough for the often cumbersome ways, that is, the only 
ways to reach specific goals? Does he have any inkling of the 
pitfalls of political maneuvering? On its campaign posters for 
the Bundestag elections, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] will 
list Rexrodt behind Klaus Kinkel. Next to the foreign minister 
and party chairman, he is the key man the Liberals can offer to 
the public. He is saddled with the thankless job of being the 
symbol of economic ability in--of all places--the trough of the 
hitherto most severe recession. He can defy managers and 
bankers. He is self-confident in his demeanor. But how will the 
public receive him? It is also a matter of winning the minority 
who wants to see the country overcome the paralysis? This is 
exactly what causes some Liberals to ask the worrisome question: 
Will he be able to deliver the people he is addressing? 
  Hannover, pedestrian zone, FDP booth with a jazz band. In 
five days, Lower Saxony is going to the polls. The pollsters 
give the Liberals plus or minus 5 percent. Voters have the 
opportunity to talk with the actual Federal Minister of 
Economics. The very fact that he is 1.90m tall makes the man in 
the elegant black cashmere overcoat tower over the group of 
passersby. "Working less for the same money, that time is gone," 
he explains to a young man in a trenchcoat. In the future, it 
must be possible, if necessary, to work less for less money. And 
those--primarily the middle class--who want to work harder must 
also get more money. The minister wants to abolish all "rigid 
regulations." The country, with its intelligent and industrious 
people, already finds itself in the center of the revolution, he 
notes. And it looks like this: No governmental labor offices, 
but small private businesses around the corner will create new 
jobs. Mature citizens will shop when and where they want. Of 
course, this cannot be accomplished without the FDP because the 
large popular parties--look at store closings and Kohl's 
caving-in to the lobby--have no longer the strength to change 
everything. But the economics minister with his modest 
abilities, whose operative influence hardly ever goes beyond a 
couple of pots of subsidies, cannot do it either. His only 
influence is if his warnings hit a nerve. 
<H5>  Everybody Has To Look Up to Him </H5>
  Most people who stop in the pedestrian zone do so because 
they want to rub shoulders with the important political bigshot. 
But with him, that is impossible. "Party of the entrepreneurs," 
a recipient receiving social security benefits is shouting. 
"When you scream, you are wrong," Rexrost replies, "You must 
talk in a low voice, very low voice." Another refers to his 
"disillusionment with politics." In a tone that seems to 
indicate that he is grateful to that person for giving him the 
cue, the minister shoots back: "This is empty talk. Get 
involved. Throw us out, but vote for Democratic 
politicians"--earlier, some of the bystanders had mentioned that 
they were Republicans. Now the minister is accused of "social 
dismantling." "Out of 1,000 billion" [as published]--Rexrodt 
repeats that figure three times--15 have been laid off, "a mere 
1.5 percent." Whoever is talking of dismantlement, is "blind." 
And when the minister, untouched, does not react to the 
accusation that his party boycotts long-term care insurance, a 
passerby blurts out: "You are quite a clever man. But not for 
the people who are standing here." This accuser as well gets a 
smile from the minister. Everybody has to look up to him. He is 
beaming down on them. Although closely crammed together, almost 
touching one another, because otherwise, the jazz band makes it 
impossible to hear each other, the minister keeps an imaginary 
distance that could be measured in kilometers. 
  Later, Guenter Rexrodt contradicts--with a smile--the 
observation that, although he might impress an audience, he 
would be unable to warm it up. He wants to know whether they had 
noticed what a good listener he really was, "This is one of my 
strengths." However, in a pedestrian zone, he notes, it is 
impossible to persuade people. That is the function of party 
conventions, Bundestag debates, congresses. There he tends to 
fire away quite differently. How can such self-confidence be 
shattered? Perhaps, by citing Lambsdorff and trying the thesis 
that, as the last Bundestag debate of the German position had 
demonstrated, the count was the better speaker. Wrong! Whenever 
he is writing his own speeches, they have a "sensational" 
effect, such as at the FDP's Three Kings convention. Rexrodt on 
the offensive. If he does not use texts prepared by his 
advisors--and that cannot be avoided in some instances because 
he lacks the time to draft them himself--but speaks 
extemporaneously, "then I am really a knockout." With such 
confessions, the reporter's note pad is getting full. 
  This economics minister does not hide his light under the 
bushel. Incidentally, a few days earlier, the East Asian Society 
in Hamburg--all of them businessmen and bankers--awarded Rexrodt 
for his speech with a "standing ovation." On the other hand, his 
relations with association presidents are not particularly warm. 
"They keep moaning and groaning into my ears, while they 
themselves have nothing to say," he told his colleagues. He 
rarely sees President Hans Peter Stihl of the Federation of 
Chambers of German Industry and Commerce. His contact with BDI 
[Federation of German Industries] President Tyll Necker is 
somewhat closer, but such in nature that the Economics Ministry 
is familiar with the sigh, "He has been sniggering behind my 
back again." 
  No, although as a politician, Guenter Rexrodt is a loner, he 
is not a man without idiosyncracies. It just has not yet gotten 
around how he feels about the "eavesdropping attack" or NATO 
expansion. In the Cabinet, he only talks about subjects related 
to his own area. And what about the FDP Presidium, to which he, 
as a minister, has access? "I intentionally am keeping a low 
profile," is how Rexrodt explains his political abstinence from 
anything that has nothing to do with economics. "I do not want 
to get into everything like Zampano." Rather he would like to 
convey the feeling, "The man knows what he is talking about." 
Not until 18 March, when he will be elected head of the Berlin 
FDP--which is known as a pool of sharks--and only after he has a 
Bundestag mandate, will he show what he is made of. 
  With whom could this Rexrodt be compared? Not with 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. "He is essentially a populist, and that 
I am not," he defines himself. "I am different, straightforward, 
calling a spade a spade. I am always telling the truth. The time 
for populist politics is gone." His relationship with Genscher 
is not bad, Rexrodt notes in an effort to avoid 
misunderstandings. After all, his father in the GDR used to be 
Genscher's local chairman of the Liberals there. But once in a 
while, there have been some fireworks between Genscher and 
Rexrodt in the FDP Presidium. For instance, when Rexrodt 
described social security benefits as being unstable (he did so 
because, as a politician, he wants to tell the truth), calling 
those who screamed "outmoded" populist types, such as Norbert 
Bluem. Genscher sarcastically inquired in the Presidium about 
the FDP's official view on what one person had said over the 
weekend. This did not just provoke a mere crackling; sparks were 
flying. Rexrodt prefers to be compared with Lambsdorff. He noted 
that he is "just like him," an "economic liberal." And they are 
"no heartless fools," but people who know that the economy is a 
means to an end, that is, it should benefit the largest possible 
number of people. With Klaus Kinkel, Rexrodt maintains a 
nonrelationship. And foreign policy? To put it plainly: In the 
Bonn Cabinet, Rexrodt already is a minister of the Berlin 
Republic. "I am not a West European," he admits. "In terms of 
mentality, Poland and Hungary are closer to our people." 
  Rexrodt was born in Berlin. His mother died during a 
night-time bomb attack. After the war, his father--in the Weimar 
Republic, Reichs executive secretary of the Democratic 
Party--became one of the cofounders of the LDPD [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Germany], which later on turned into a 
fringe party. The son lived with relatives in Thuringia because 
his father fled to West Berlin. Shortly before the Wall was 
built, Guenter Rexrodt got out as well, enrolled as a part-time 
student of business administration at the Free University and 
made a career for himself at the Chamber of Commerce. He widened 
his horizon in New York, where he worked as a banker at Citibank 
headquarters office until he joined the board of its Frankfurt 
branch. Still, the Western orientation of the Bonn Republic 
remained alien to him. "Emotionally, my orientation is toward 
the East." He studied Russian until he graduated from high 
school and then acquired his knowledge of the Wall 
Street-American language in New York. At the Trust Agency, he 
was in charge of privatizing the construction industry, the 
textile industry, agriculture, and responsible for Special 
Assets. 
  Above his desk in Bonn, the economics minister has, in a 
frame, a black-red-gold flag, an heirloom of the Pauls-Church 
period. It explains, without saying so, that Rexrodt sees 
himself following the tradition of German liberalism, that 
"revolution" has a positive sound to him, too. The upper-class 
tradition he continues on today's barricades against 
overregulation gives this man, who is often treated with 
hostility, his astounding self-confidence. If necessary, one can 
imagine him as part of a rainbow coalition. About the Greens' 
Joschka Fischer, whom he appreciates as a discussion partner, 
Guenter Rexrodt says: "He is much more conservative than I."

<F P=106> [Speech by Bundeswehr Inspector General Klaus Naumann at the </F>
"Bundeswehr and Society" forum held by WELT AM SONNTAG in Berlin 
on 22 March: "The Bundeswehr Is Undergoing a Change Equal to a 
New Beginning"] 
  [Text] Germany is no longer a frontline country and no 
longer lies within the scope of plans by an enemy capable of 
staging an invasion. Therefore our country is no longer a 
battle zone. It is now a communications zone, insofar as 
conflicts can be prevented or offset. 
  This is an opportunity that we have never before had in our 
history. Taking advantage of this opportunity is a challenge 
for German politics. German politics requires armed forces as a 
means of implementing a policy that prevents conflicts. The 
shape of the armed forces must correspond to this changed 
situation. 
  To this end, one must consider what constants and what 
variables determine the development of the armed forces, so that 
we may reach planning decisions accordingly. 
  The following factors have medium-term and long-term 
validity: 
  -- The need to be able to defend German territory remains 
valid. This is the primary task for all sectors of the armed 
forces. In the future, however, this task can only be 
accomplished following mobilization, and only together with the 
alliance partners. 
  When one considers the armed forces of Europe in relation to 
the defense capability of each of them, one concludes that the 
only serious land-based threat to Germany is Russia. 
Theoretically, any country not allied to us could pose an 
aerial threat if it possesses nuclear, biological, or chemical 
weapons of sufficient range. A serious maritime threat to 
Germany could only occur if all maritime links were broken off. 
But this is pure theory, because such a measure would also 
affect our NATO partners, and as far as one can judge there is 
no force on earth that could defeat, now or in the future, a 
NATO sea-based military operation. 
  To defend itself, Germany requires the following: 
  -- The ability to reconnoiter in good time any developments 
that could develop into a crisis; 
  -- Land forces that, following a period of mobilization and 
military preparations, are fully capable, in cooperation with 
our alliance partners, of defending Germany against a potential 
danger from the East; 
  -- Air forces capable of surveilling German air space in 
peacetime, and defending this air space in a time of war or 
crisis, following mobilization, and in cooperation with the 
alliance partners. 
  -- Naval forces that, acting in cooperation with the 
alliance 
partners, can keep sea lanes open and prevent landings on the 
German coast. 
  These are our defense measures against a situation that our 
politics must be aimed at preventing. This defense capability 
has a preventive effect. But conflicts can really only be 
offset when one conducts negotiations at an early stage and thus 
prevents the conflicts from developing further. Therefore, 
participation in alliance activity, especially in the 
containment of crises and prevention of conflicts, remains a 
constant for us. For this purpose, Germany needs army, air 
force, and naval units that can be rapidly mobilized and 
deployed, and can maintain their positions. These units are to 
be deployed in such a way that our country can meet its 
obligations vis-a-vis NATO and the WEU [Western European Union] 
and exercise its full responsibility as a UN member. 
  Finally, the supply of modern, high-quality equipment to our 
troops is also a constant, for technological developments in the 
sphere of armaments are continuing, albeit at a somewhat slower 
pace. However, hopes that reduced quantities of high-quality 
military equipment would be sufficient for today's times have 
turned out to be somewhat naive. 
  Here are some of the variable factors. The development of 
the situation in and around Europe can no longer be accurately 
predicted, unlike during the era of confrontation. But for the 
foreseeable future, it must be assumed that: 
  -- An offensive by the strongest military power in Europe, 
the 1.5-2 million-strong Russian Army, would be possible only if 
there were a complete change in Russian politics, and there is 
no sign of such a change. But even in such a case, an offensive 
could not take place without extensive prior preparations, 
including at least a partial mobilization. Therefore, for the 
time being, one can expect advance warning of such a danger of 
at least 12 months. But we would only have a fraction of this 
time to prepare ourselves militarily. 
  -- Europe must be prepared for the new risks and dangers. On 
the one hand, these risks can be explained by the fact that a 
new order has arisen following the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
But on the other hand, they can be attributed to the 
innumerable unsolved national and ethnic disputes in Europe; 
  -- Our principle of security policy, defense measures, and 
armed forces activity will no longer be geared to just alliance 
commitments. Henceforth they will be determined by a mixture of 
our national security interest in offsetting conflicts together 
with our partners and our international commitments. 
  Guaranteeing security in Europe is no longer sufficient. It 
is necessary to achieve security for Europe. Therefore, when 
assessing the situation, we must consider the problems that are 
spreading to Europe from the highly unstable peripheral areas of 
Africa and Asia. It is necessary to eliminate the causes of 
conflicts in security policy. 
  For this purpose one requires armed forces that can be set 
in 
motion without a long period of preparation, and that can be 
used in various ways, from humanitarian missions to fighting 
operations. 
  Our alliance commitments are as variable as the development 
of risks and the effects thereof on the shape of the armed 
forces. The basic commitment of contributing to collective 
defense remains unaltered, but the German contribution no longer 
consists of merely defending Central Europe. 
  The Bundeswehr's "new" set of tasks is as follows: This 
fundamentally revised political framework shows the extent of 
Germany's increased international responsibility. It also 
indicates the need for a conceptual orientation of the 
Bundeswehr that acknowledges the fact that support for and 
participation in international moves to contain and prevent 
conflicts and crises is a task equal to the primary function of 
collective defense. 
  This means having to maintain three categories of tasks for 
the armed forces, while adhering strictly to the principle that 
only the three categories together make up the Bundeswehr, and 
no category can exist without the other. 
  The first category of tasks serves a protective purpose. It 
involves being at the disposal of NATO allies beyond German 
territory, and includes crisis management within the NATO 
framework. This is how we interpret the defense of Germany 
within the NATO alliance, whereby the defense of NATO territory 
is placed on a par with that of Germany. 
  As part of the second category of tasks, the German armed 
forces must be in a position to contribute to the international 
prevention of conflicts and crises. 
  The third category of tasks involves Bundeswehr 
participation 
in humanitarian and special missions, as well as preliminary 
training, and logistical and medical work. 
  With this broad spectrum of tasks, the point is no longer to 
marshal the armed forces in the face of a broad-scale 
aggression, as was the case during the period of East-West 
confrontation. We will continue to be an army of unity, but we 
shall dispense with the idea of being a unified army, for we all 
know that the Bundeswehr was never unified in the past, and was 
unable to perform all its tasks independently. What is 
manifesting itself today is a "Bundeswehr of variety" not 
because of resources, but because of the altered political 
situation. 
  Concerning the restructuring of our armed forces: Generally, 
the point is to gear the Bundeswehr more strongly than before to 
the two large but different tasks; a defense of the alliance on 
the one hand, and the containment of crises of the other. This 
will not lead to a separation, for military personnel must be 
interchangeable between each set of tasks. 
  In the defense of the alliance, the hitherto broad-scale and 
rather static principle of frontal defense must make way for the 
principle of a flexible counter-concentration of forces. This 
requires even greater cooperation between the air, sea, and land 
forces, as well as mobility and flexible military structures. 
But the troops must be geared to a single form of operations, 
and they must achieve full operational ability only after an 
extensive period of training. 
  In crises and conflict prevention, however, NATO-wide means 
of action will be implemented in the form of army, navy, and air 
force contingents that can be mobilized quickly and deployed 
rapidly and at great distances. In the sphere of planning, the 
fulcrum of our activity lies in the following fields: 
leadership, electronic command systems, wide-scale 
reconnaissance, helicopters, long-range artillery, air defense, 
air transport, first aid, and logistics. 
  Our experiences from earlier operations are to be taken onto 
consideration. The following can be said: 
  In the army, it is expedient to adhere to a balanced 
combination of mechanized, light, airborne, and air-mechanized 
forces, in other words, forces that are capable of providing 
fighting power for the air, coupled with ground support, 
logistics, and first aid. However, one must consider how to 
reconcile the considerable differences between NATO defense and 
crisis prevention in terms of structure, equipment, training, 
and logistics. This reconciliation cannot take place without 
changes to the infrastructure. 
  The air force is faced mainly with the duties of air 
defense, 
precision weapons, and air transport, whereby it also has to 
face adaptation and modernization. 
  The navy's main task will be to contribute to anticrisis 
operations without any geographic or time limitations. It will 
deliver supplies to personnel serving in destroyers and frigates 
distant from our shores. In addition, one must examine whether 
the navy can supply platforms serving as command, supply, and 
first aid bases for combat units. 
  For the air industry, this involves even greater 
international cooperation, and at the same time a greater 
concentration on national production capacity of the following, 
which we need on account of defense capability: armored 
fighting vehicles, conventional submarines, sensor and 
transponder technology, aviation, and information technology. 
  Concerning training in the Bundeswehr: Not only is training 
and equipment undergoing changes on account of the broader 
spectrum of tasks and operations for our Bundeswehr, but 
training also requires changes, something I have been 
emphasizing ever since I took office. 
  Until now, the entire Bundeswehr has been geared to the 
task of deploying troops for defense purposes after a relatively 
brief period of preparation and, at the same time, commencing 
general mobilization. We must abandon this uniformity as well, 
as a result of the altered situation, in order to save money for 
investments. 
  Training for national defense requires the adoption of a 
priority method of operation, in other words defense in a 
predetermined geographical area, under operational conditions 
that have largely been determined beforehand. This requires a 
period of intensive training of at least one month in advance of 
deployment, following partial mobilization. 
  The training of units to counteract crises must be shaped in 
such a way that efficient units can quickly be formed out of 
larger closed units and quickly be sent to their area of 
operations. The training must involve all types of combat and 
all operational scenarios, cannot take just one area of 
operations into consideration, and must take into account the 
fact that there must be a fluid transition between all types of 
operations, whether humanitarian missions or peacekeeping 
operations according to Chapter VII of the Basic Law, and that 
any operation can develop into a combat one. 
  There is good progress in facing up to the new spectrum of 
tasks. Motivation and dedication have risen in an impressive 
manner, and there is a broad-scale readiness to go into action 
even at great risk and at the expense of personal comfort, 
something one does not encounter too often in our country. 
  But, on the other hand, military service has a bad 
reputation, and our society views soldiers as compelled to play 
a special part in the alliance. There is a lack of consensus in 
our country about the deployment and future role of the 
Bundeswehr. 
  I am no longer capable of explaining to one of our marines 
in 
the Adriatic why a German ship or aircraft cannot enter Albanian 
waters or air space, even though Albania has permitted NATO to 
use its territorial areas to enforce the embargo against 
Yugoslavia. As a German, I also feel embarrassed when I imagine 
a situation where an aircraft flying over the Adriatic receives 
a radioed order to identify a ship in Albanian waters, followed 
by the sentence: You are a German aircraft, are you not? 
  These are the expectations vis-a-vis society: A readiness to 
accept duties. Military service means a readiness to accept 
duties and risk one's life in discharging them. 
  If we succeed in achieving a broad social consensus on this 
matter, then it will be easy to hold a debate about the 
Bundeswehr, its tasks, and its operations. 
  Soldiers require support. We require a broad social 
consensus about the role of the Bundeswehr. The population must 
stand by the side of its soldiers and their families whenever 
they have to enter combat operations as a result of a political 
decision. 
  The implementation of German unity must be the unequivocal 
priority of our country. It is also unequivocal among our 
soldiers. 
  Nevertheless, reliable long-term financial planning for the 
Bundeswehr contributes to the credibility of our security and 
NATO policy. 
  Just like the rest of society, our Bundeswehr is in the 
throes of a profound transformation. The armed forces are 
undergoing a change that is equal to a new beginning.

<F P=106> ["mon" report: "No National Minority"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The Central Council of German Sinti and 
Romanyi gypsies has demanded full recognition of this ethnic 
group as a "national minority" from the Federal Government. The 
government is pursuing a "policy of refusal and isolation" by 
refusing this status, Romanyi Rose, the chairman of the Central 
Council, said in Bonn yesterday. Just as the German Danish and 
Sorbs, who are better off in terms of legal rights, the 70,000 
Sinti and Romanyi gypsies with German citizenship and hundreds 
of years of links to their homes are a national and ethnic 
minority, Rose said. 
  According to Rose, the FRG has committed itself to 
recognizing and protecting minorities in several international 
treaties. However, it does not derive the necessary steps from 
that. The Sinti and Romanyi gypsies do not expect any 
improvement from the forthcoming reform of the Basic Law, 
either: No majority has been achieved for a provision that 
commits the state to the active protection of minorities. 
  Rose accused the Federal Government of "unfair methods" and 
of deceiving parliament. According to him, in its human rights 
report in December 1993 Germany had made a condition before it 
signed a relevant UN resolution. According to this, in Germany's 
view, state recognition as a minority "presupposes an ancestral, 
traditional settlement area." However, the protocol does not 
prove such a reservation. 
  Rose assessed a poll by the Emnid Institute, which says that 
68 percent of the Germans reject Sinti and Romanyi gypsies on 
principle and do not want them as neighbors either as alarming. 
In Rose's view, the reason for the Federal Government's refusal 
to recognize the Sinti and Romanyi gypsies is basically due to a 
"deeply rooted" aversion against his ethnic group.

<F P=106> [Article by Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt: "Gearing </F>
Up for More Employment"] 
  [Text] Improving employment prospects is the main 
challenge that German economic policy faces over the next few 
years. To achieve that goal, we must bolster positive trends in 
the old laender, promote growth in the new laender, and secure 
the international competitiveness of the German economy. 
Increasing investment by companies and state investment in the 
infrastructure is a priority. This is the only way in which new 
and secure jobs can be created. A new boost in investment 
assumes that the high level of costs will be reduced and that 
more room for maneuver will be created for entrepreneurial 
activity. 
  In the fall of 1993, the government presented an extensive 
range of measures with its report on securing Germany's future 
as a center for business. These measures are being rapidly 
implemented. I need only mention the Law on Facilitating 
Investment and Land for Housing Construction, the Old Debt Law, 
the removal of fixed rates in the transportation of goods, the 
Law on Securing Germany's Future as a Center for Business, and 
the guaranteeing of training posts in eastern Germany. The 
action program for more growth and employment has allowed us to 
make a significant amount of progress. 
  To improve the employment situation, structural problems in 
the labor market also have to be eliminated. Over a period of 
many years, especially in times of strong growth and high 
employment, structures and patterns of conduct developed that 
are only an obstacle to overcoming the crisis rapidly. The key 
elements of an employment policy geared toward growth, 
employment, and competitiveness are a new orientation with 
respect to policy on collective agreements, higher flexibility 
in the labor market, as well as the development of effective 
labor market policy measures. 
<H5>  Collective Agreements Are Often Too Rigid </H5>
  The partners to collective wage agreements must find their 
way back to wages that are justified in market terms and are 
linked to shortages on the labor market. More consideration 
must be given to the requirements of the unemployed and weak 
companies than has been the case so far. The labor market 
situation requires more sharply differentiated wage settlements 
based on regions, branches, and qualifications, as well as room 
for maneuver for individual company solutions and elements based 
on company earnings. Many collective agreements have come to 
form too rigid a framework, making it impossible to respond to 
new demands and market developments in a flexible enough manner. 
The justified interests of the unemployed should no longer be 
ignored in negotiations on collective wage agreements. For 
example, it should be possible for the long-term unemployed to 
be paid rates below those contained in collective agreements for 
a limited period of time to facilitate the return of those 
people to the labor market. There has been some movement in 
this respect, as the settlement in the chemical industry shows. 
  The policy on collective agreements must also address the 
fact that there are people seeking employment whose 
qualifications and ability do not correspond to the requirements 
of a high-wage economy oriented toward the world market and that 
they will not be employed for that reason. The high-wage policy 
in the Federal Republic has led to a high level of unemployment 
despite there being more than enough work, because there is a 
low demand for poorly qualified workers who are paid according 
to collective agreement rates. That is why we need an 
additional low wage sector. The state, as an employer and 
collective agreement partner, must also send out the right 
signals during this year's collective agreement negotiations. 
That is why the government decided to freeze civil servants' 
salaries this year. In the new laender, the issue is above all 
one of extending the period over which incomes will be adjusted 
to levels in western Germany. This is also an area in which the 
state must assume a vanguard role. 
  To overcome the employment crisis, it is still necessary to 
make use of opportunities for employment that have not been 
exploited to date. We have a great demand for services in 
private households, for example, in areas such as child care, 
looking after elderly people, and for part-time jobs. That is 
why the government intends to make the creation of employment 
opportunities in private households and of part-time jobs easier. 
  The demand for part-time jobs is much greater than the 
supply. This is an area in which companies must overcome their 
often unjustified reservations. In many areas, with some 
imagination and flexibility, part-time employment would be 
possible, and it would often benefit companies in the form of 
higher motivation and productivity as well as lower absenteeism. 
To assist the move to part-time employment, we will guarantee 
unemployment insurance benefits for a fixed period of time if 
employees transfer from full-time to part-time employment. In 
the public sector, too, the government will issue a clear 
signal. A readiness to consider new forms of work organization 
is something that I also hope will emerge from the joint actions 
of unions, employers, the Federal Office of Employment, and the 
government, aimed at creating more part-time employment. 
<H5>  Private Employment Agencies </H5>
  Additional jobs can also be created if there is more scope 
for organizational creativity. This applies to policy on 
collective agreements, on working hours, as well as labor market 
organizational structures. The government will permit private 
employment agencies so that competition between private and 
public employment agencies will balance out the situation in the 
labor market more quickly and efficiently. This step has been 
long overdue, because the monopoly enjoyed by the Federal Office 
of Employment, which might have been justified when it was 
formed, has not met the demands of a highly technical and highly 
industrialized economy for a long time now. Employment will be 
further stimulated by extending the duration of limited 
employment contracts. 
  Working hours is a very important area in which the German 
economy and labor market must become more flexible. This is an 
area in which too many rigid structures, along with constant 
reductions in working hours, have developed. This applies to 
daily, weekly, and annual working hours as well the length of 
working lives. The parties to collective agreements must be 
serious about flexible working hours, and they must be ready to 
respond to a much greater extent to individual wishes regarding 
longer or shorter working hours. There is no general recipe for 
making working hours more flexible and work organization more 
productive; various forms of work organization are possible. 
The government will create a better framework with a new labor 
law. The law will create more scope for additional work when 
necessary and work on Saturdays and Sundays. With regard to 
working lives, we want to and must reverse the trend to 
retirement at an increasingly earlier age, if only because of 
Germany's demographic development. 
<H5>  A Bridge for Reintegration </H5>
  In times of high unemployment, labor market policy performs 
an important social function. Further training and retraining, 
job-creation measures, and wage-cost supplements should assist 
the return to normal employment. Since German unification, 
these instruments have been used extensively to cushion 
structural change. In the meantime, however, we have reached 
the limits of what is acceptable in terms of budgetary and 
economic policy. Labor market policy measures have to be 
financed at the expense of competitive jobs. Germany is already 
in the lead with regard to wage ancillary costs. In addition, 
it has emerged that the form that some of these instruments take 
obscures the way in which in regular jobs differentiate to too 
great an extent. The government has introduced adjustments that 
consider both economic and social aspects. 
  Job-creation measures can contribute to easing structural 
change in the new laender and to cushioning the effects of the 
recession on disadvantaged groups in the west German labor 
market. However, it must be clearly seen that this will not 
lead to the creation of permanent, competitive jobs, but is only 
a social bridge for reintegration into the first labor market. 
If such measures are applied extensively for increasingly 
longer periods of time, there is a growing danger that private 
companies will experience pressure and be disadvantaged. This 
is particularly problematic when a medium-sized business is 
still in the first stages of development. In addition, those 
employed under such measures begin to harbor illusions that they 
have normal and permanent jobs. This impression is reinforced 
when people employed under job-creation measures are largely 
paid according to collective wage agreement rates. 
  To avoid distorting competition and insufficient motivation 
to change to regular employment, the government has called on 
the partners to collective agreements to agree on special wage 
scales for subsidized jobs in particular. State wage-cost 
supplements for job-creation measures will be limited to certain 
wage levels in the future. Funds can then be used to assist 
more unemployed people. There will also be more incentives to 
transfer to normal employment. In those regions in the old 
laender that are particularly affected by structural crises, 
subsidies for a limited period of time will be introduced under 
Chapter 259 of the Law on Promoting Employment. This will allow 
wage benefits to be turned into wage-cost supplements for 
measures to improve the environment, social services, and the 
youth assistance programs. Further, an additional offer will go 
out to the unemployed throughout Germany in the form of 
community work projects. These will be state subsidized forms 
of employment for which pay will not be based on collective 
agreement wage scales. It will more often be the case that 
unemployed people who voluntarily participate in such schemes 
will receive a flat rate of compensation. 
<H5>  Framework Conditions Have Been Improved </H5>
  Government labor market and employment policy is geared 
toward facilitating the creation of additional competitive jobs 
through more flexibility and more room for maneuver as well as 
reducing regulations and the tax burden. That is because in a 
world of rapidly changing technology and increasing 
international competitiveness, only he who responds quickly and 
flexibly to change will be able to stand his ground. Thus, the 
government has improved framework conditions through a series of 
important measures. It is now up to the partners to collective 
wage agreements, companies, and employees to use this to create 
more employment.

German Industry: "The Breakuo of Industries of the New Laender"] 
  [Text] The objective of a dynamic economic growth has not 
yet been attained in the new laender, but east German industry 
has, by and large, consolidated itself, albeit at a low level. 
With a 6.3-percent growth in the GNP in 1993, the new laender 
have earned a reputation in Germany and Europe as "Growth Region 
Number One." A 6- to 8-percent increase in the GNP can be 
expected this year. However, these growth figures should not 
cloud the fact that eastern Germany continues to be dependent on 
the "western bread-basket," for, last year, almost half the 
east's expenditures were financed by the West. 
<H5>  A Divided Industrial Development </H5>
  A gradual rise in eastern Germany's productivity is to be 
expected over the next few years. However, the increased 
productivity will not be equal in all industrial spheres. 
Differentiation is to be expected just as before. In those 
industrial spheres that produce for local markets or profit 
directly from west German transfer payments, the progress is 
obvious. That applies to handicrafts and the retail trade, 
services and the construction industry, and to industrial 
branches such as food and mineral resources. On the other hand, 
those industrial branches involved in competition with the west, 
such as the textile, machine, and chemical industries, are still 
faced with considerable difficulties. 
  Many industrial branches should expand their production 
during 1994, so that the economic growth in the east will reach 
a new dimension. At the same time, personnel reductions should 
be halted. 
  In view of the veritable "cold shower" suffered particularly 
by industry in the new laender, it is not only necessary to halt 
personnel reductions there, but also create new jobs. This 
requirement is made all the clearer when one compares the 
situation in the east with that in the west. In the east, the 
number of people employed in industry per 1 million of the total 
population is only 50 percent of the western figure, and 
industrial turnover is only 20 percent of the western figure. 
<H5>  Reasons for the Breakup of Industry </H5>
  There is no doubt that the breakup of industry on a massive 
scale in the east is the result of a combination of several 
factors: 
  -- The introduction of the German mark on 1 July 1990 
represented a massive change for the enterprises in the former 
GDR [German democratic Republic]. The east German enterprises 
were exposed to international competition virtually overnight. 
They had no time to create the competitiveness that was missing 
in terms of the quality and price of their products. 
  -- As a result of East European trade's conversion from 
transfer rubles to hard currency on 1 January 1991 and the 
subsequent drastic restructuring in the countries of Central and 
East Europe, east German enterprises lost their traditional 
markets. After all, 70 percent of east German trade was 
earmarked for East Europe. 
  -- As a result of the "Rapid Adaptation of the Standard of 
Living" slogan of 1990, firms found themselves under enormous 
financial pressure. Industrial plants were compelled to come to 
terms with wage increases of 25 percent and more, and this at a 
level of productivity comparable to Greece. This was nothing 
less than a death sentence to those plants that had found 
themselves exposed to foreign competition. 
  -- Potential investors encountered numerous obstacles in the 
new laender. There were major deficiencies in the 
infrastructure, and major problems with the acquisition of 
property. Added to this was the inefficiency of the 
administration and unresolved ecological issues, such as the 
question of who should take over the responsibility for old 
waste deposits. 
  -- A comparison with the economic situation of private and 
due-to-be-privatized enterprises brought home the fact that 
enterprises managed by the Trust Agency are in a comparatively 
worse situation with their orders, and have a lower turnover and 
lower level of investments. 
  -- All the above factors were joined by another one -- the 
effect of the worldwide recession on Germany. The year 1993 
brought Germany the biggest drop in production since the war. 
  In view of all these changes and developments and the 
combination thereof, industrial development in the new laender 
comes as a surprise to no one. Needless to say, the dramatic 
impact of these developments, especially the impact on the labor 
market, could have been softened by means of different conduct 
and different concepts. The necessary revision of thinking 
should have occurred at an early stage. 
<H5>  Developing a Feeling for Reality and Confidence </H5>
  In the meantime, it should have become clear to everyone 
that 
a centrally managed economy cannot be converted into a 
free-market economy over the space of just a few years and 
without major upheavals. Prosperity can neither be decreed nor 
enforced. Therefore expectations and behavior must be adapted to 
the reality. 
  This requires that the people of eastern Germany restrain 
their demands that the people of western Germany cease thinking 
in materialistic terms. Old habits must be reconsidered and new 
priorities established. A high degree of restraint and maturity 
is required in the east and in the west. This must be reflected 
in wage policy. In order to alleviate the costs crisis in 
industry and the already precarious situation of the labor 
market, the social partners in the East can no longer use 
western wage levels as a pattern, for the only assets 
enterprises have are those which they themselves create through 
market competition. To stop the competitiveness of enterprises 
exposed to competition from deteriorating even further, a 
clearer orientation of productivity is necessary just as much as 
a stronger flexibility and differentiation of wages. 
<H5>  Reorientation to Western Markets </H5>
  But east German entrepreneurs are also required to alter 
their way of thinking. Because the traditional Central and East 
European consumer markets have almost completely disappeared and 
the development of the situation particularly in the countries 
of the former Soviet Union is not quite clear, there must be a 
reorientation to Western markets. There is no alternative to 
this reorientation, even if external factors still make it 
difficult to win new customers and markets. 
  In order to increase the market for east German products and 
thus improve the orders situation for east German enterprises, 
the Confederation of German Industry and Trust Agency together 
launched the so-called New Bundeslaender Trade Offensive at the 
beginning of last year. The purpose of this initiative, 
sponsored by the "Industrial Initiative for Germany," is to 
double the trade capacity of the west German economy between 
1992 and 1995. At first, 33 west German enterprises belonged to 
this trade initiative. Now, 100 industrial and trade 
enterprises belong to it. 
  Even if the New Bundeslaender Trade Offensive has got off to 
a good start, it cannot solve all the trade problems of east 
German enterprises on its own. In addition to this, a 
continuation of the Trust Agency's privatization activity is 
just as necessary as an increased competitiveness of the 
products manufactured in the new laender. The introduction of 
time-limited and regressively structured value-added tax 
concessions would have been very helpful for industrial 
enterprises in the new laender, and would have made it easier 
for them to enter the harsh markets of the Western world. They 
woid have received a bonus for every mark they earned. The 
advantage of this idea is that the bonuses would have depended 
on productivity, and not on the principle whereby "he who incurs 
the greatest losses receives the largest subsidies." Market 
forces would not have been paralyzed, and because of the 
time-limitation and regressive-structure factor, the possible 
financial burden for households would have been limited. 
  But unfortunately, this proposal, already a subject of 
debate 
by the Confederation of German Industry for quite some time, has 
not been implemented to this very day, even though it would be a 
useful addition to the economy-promotion programs for the new 
laender, especially the program to encourage investments. 
  In view of the need to renew the out-dated capital assets in 
the new laender, the government's proposal to promote capital is 
most welcome. But because investments need time before they 
have an impact on the labor market, parallel measures are 
desirable in at least a few selected branches, measures such as 
wage restraint and the value-added tax concessions I mentioned 
earlier. Just as before, the main economic-political challenge 
is to consolidate investment activity and create permanently 
profitable jobs in eastern Germany. 
  This challenge can only be met if the locational conditions 
in the whole of the Federal Republic are improved, for the 
continually necessary financial help for eastern Germany cannot 
be permanently provided at the expense of general prosperity, 
but has to be earned by enterprises in harsh international 
competition. 
<H5>  Solving Structural Problems </H5>
  Therefore the problem is not just to overcome development 
difficulties, but above all to solve the structural problems. 
This applies to the high labor costs and costs of environmental 
protection, the unusually high tax burden, the social security 
network that can hardly be financed any more, and the runaway 
national debt. 
  In order to overcome the cost crisis in the economy and the 
confidence crisis in politics, a priority task is to restrain 
the ever increasing activity of the state, for economic growth 
is not an automatic process. It can only occur when market 
forces are free to develop. 
  For this purpose,the social security system must be made 
more 
dependent on one's own contribution. Without appropriate 
incentives, an abuse of this system at the expense of the 
socially insured is guaranteed. 
  Last but not least, job guarantees must be accorded greater 
importance in wages policy. Only when we face the facts and 
concentrate first of all not on material distribution, but on 
economic growth, can the competitiveness of German industry be 
improved and east German industry be provided with fresh 
prospects.

<F P=106> [Article by "df": "The Classic Wage Agreement Is a Thing of </F>
the Past"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 8 Mar--Hans Peter Stihl, president of 
the German Industrial and Trade Association--the first to call 
for "zero-change negotiations" for 1994 wages--"is now pleased 
that the earlier assessment by the employers that `zero-change 
negotiations are naive and confrontational,' was contradicted by 
the metal industry's Hannover wage agreement." 
  In retrospect, Stihl also favors the employers' spectacular 
cancellation of the metal industry's vacation compact. "It was 
necessary for the employers to give this unequivocal signal to 
emphasize the seriousness of the situation. Such a sledgehammer 
approach is sometimes needed when dealing with trade unions to 
help them understand economic realities." 
  Stihl said that this time the metal industry had been able 
to 
avoid disproportional increases for low-wage groups, which in 
the past had contributed to a steadily rising unemployment base. 
In the course of such mistaken wage policy, wage groups I and II 
had been abolished. Thus, an important potential source of 
employment was voluntarily eliminated. It would help facilitate 
reincoporation of the unemployed if these two wage groups were 
resurrected. 
  It is unfortunate that the Industrial Trade Union of Metal 
Workers resisted an increase in the 13/18 percent ratio of 
employers with a 40-hour workweek. An increase in this ratio is 
necessary to strengthen research and development in the German 
metal industry. "It is still true that in Japan research and 
development engineers and other highly qualified employees work 
up to 600 more hours a year than in Germany. In the long run, we 
cannot afford such a disparity." 
  The current differentiation in the workweek in the metal and 
electrical industry could be regarded as adequate, especially 
since many companies have not taken full advantage of all the 
options offered by the wage agreements. "And for that I would 
criticize the corporations; they demand greater flexibility 
without taking full advantage of existing rules." 
<H5>  Opening Wage Negotiations to Corporations Is Not Rescindable </H5>
  The Hannover secure employment agreement, which opens the 
way 
for plants to negotiate wages, is limited to two years. There 
will now be many deviations from collective bargaining 
agreements. Stihl thinks that it will be impossible to rescind 
such variations after two years to return to an industry-wide 
wage agreement. "The opening for the plants must and will 
continue to exist; the traditional industry-wide wage agreement 
cannot be maintained since it no longer meets the needs of a 
widely varied industrial structure." 
  However, Stihl opposes wage agreements differentiated by 
metal branches. After all, industrial branches can develop wage 
policies tailored to their needs since the plants now have that 
opportunity. In the course of time, the in-plant agreements will 
show certain patterns for each industrial branch since there 
will be an internal exchange of information within each branch. 
That should be enough. The overall metal-industry association 
should not become the manager of the varied collective wage 
arrangements of the different branches of the metal industry. 
"Because then, it would become necessary for the overall 
metal-industry association to subdivide into numerous branch 
associations. It is an advantage that we only have a few 
associations in Germany which negotiate with the trade unions 
independently. Thus, the authority to negotiate is consolidated 
in the metal industry's overall association. But to allow as 
many associations as possible to consolidate, the collective 
wage agreements should only contain minimum provisions." 
  If the economic climate improves again, the works councils 
will try to rescind the wage sacrifices to which they have now 
agreed. This will create many conflicts within plants, and the 
Works Council Statute has not provided the machinery to resolve 
such conflicts. 
  The president of the German Industrial and Trade Association 
is convinced that the metal industry's Hannover wage agreement 
will create a precedent for the public service sector. "The 
signals emanating from the collective bargaining agreements of 
the Industrial Trade Union of Metalworkers--the largest 
industrial trade union in Europe and even the world--have always 
determined subsequent agreements with other trade unions. 
Actually, the agreement with the Public Services, 
Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union should fall 
significantly short of that of the metal industry." 
  Stihl called on German industry to pay more attention to 
college and university graduates. His firm is currently 
conducting an 18-month training program for such graduates with 
reduced pay in which they can gain work experience and augment 
their expertise. 
  Stihl commented on the dispute about nursing-care insurance, 
which industry considers to be badly conceived. If it fails, 
there is a chance that it could be reinstituted under private 
law, which is the only approach industry approves. "The 
political contortions that an amazed public has been exposed to 
hurts the reputation of all parties." That a team of experts is 
now supposed to find a mode of compensation, "is simply another 
harebrained idea in a long series of strange ideas that have 
been advanced on this subject." 
  Commenting on the economic programs that the political 
parties have now evolved, Stihl said they all seemed acceptable 
at first glance. For instance, if the German Social Democratic 
Party [SPD] calls for greater fiscal economy or for relief for 
industry, one can support the idea. However, when it comes to 
financing, it becomes apparent that the SPD wants to resurrect 
preoccupation with envy. It talks about "unwarranted income," 
and wants higher taxes on the income of top management. 
<H5>  Politics Cannot Produce Jobs </H5>
  This is not the way to finance the government, just as 
politicians cannot solve the unemployment problem with work 
programs. "There is only one primary labor market and all 
political attempts to stimulate employment by artificial means 
are bound to fail." 
  Instead of becoming entangled in employment policies, the 
government should cut expenses. "There is no reason why Germany 
needs to pay for 16 land governments, 16 landtags, 16 land 
administrations and more than 600 Bundestag representatives. 
Consolidation is just as urgently needed here as in industry. 
However, contrary to political institutions, industry attacks 
its problem with great zest." 
  Stihl criticized the "remarkable lack of scruples," the 
United States demonstrated to create the tools to apply pressure 
on Japan's trade policies. It is, of course, correct as always 
maintained that the type of surplus Japan achieves in trading 
with North America can only be explained by the fact that 
Japanese markets are not so open as is always claimed. 
Distribution channels in Japan are firmly in the hands of large 
conglomerates which can control the success or--more often--the 
failure of an importer. Thus, one does have a right to demand 
that Japan become more open. But according to Stihl such demands 
for openness should apply to the whole Western world and not 
just bilaterally to the United States. 
  German industry welcomes the expansion of the European Union 
with the addition of the nordic states and of Austria. These 
states are aware of the need for stability and favor free trade. 
However, this expansion creates a need for reform within the 
European Community. Sixteen countries can no longer be subjected 
to Brussels' penchant for regulations but must be treated in 
accordance with the principle that only those acts are 
legitimate that member states cannot perform for themselves.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Riedmiller: "End of the Honeymoon"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S.-Russian honeymoon lasted for four years; 
now it has come to an end. The collapse of the Berlin Wall in 
November 1989, with all its consequences, seemed to offer 
Washington and Moscow the opportunity to put "human interests" 
before the traditional kind of contemptible superpower policy, 
according to Gorbachev's definition. The fiction of a permanent 
U.S.-Russian harmony appeared, which was to last in spite of all 
the natural differences between these major states, thus 
allowing a bilateral, global peace management. But the success 
of the nationalist-communist forces at the Russian parliamentary 
elections swept this idea away and made it obvious that Russia 
is continuing its traditional efforts to expand its power. 
  During his visit to Moscow in January, President Clinton 
still allocated to his hosts a peacemaking role in their region 
-- as defined by the Russian military doctrine; but now a 
countermovement is beginning to form in Washington that does not 
want to grant Moscow the right to use disciplinary measures 
against its neighbors. This was triggered by the shrill 
nationalist rhetoric that is even being used by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, 
trying to outdo the "patriots" of all shades on the right-wing 
side. Other things worth thinking about are the removal from 
government of many reformers, Moscow's pressure on the Baltic 
states, its increasingly dominating position over Belarus, its 
ambiguous policy toward the Ukraine, its attempts to make the 
CIS a de facto USSR, and, last but not least, a new tone that 
can easily be recognized as the old Soviet one. 
  In the spring, Moscow returned to its old playgrounds in the 
Balkans and the Middle East -- with intentions that are still 
unclear. Thus, Kozyrev told his U.S. colleague Christopher in 
Russia's Far Eastern fortress of Vladivostok that they now have 
a "mature relationship," which can only mean: Moscow feels 
equal to Washington and there is no trace of subordination. 
  Russia cannot be expected to stay in a submissive position 
in 
the long run, following Washington's orders and not conducting a 
policy of its own interests. It cannot be blamed for wanting to 
maintain its interest; this is legitimate, as long as it is not 
done at the expense of others. This is the crucial point where 
more and more U.S. politicians stop because they think they can 
discern a new imperialistic tone in Moscow's behavior and 
demands. Now the question arises whether today's and tomorrow's 
Russia is still the one with which the United States can conduct 
politics based on partnership. 
  Are the premises on which the concept of a partnership of 
superpowers is based still correct, even if Russia is to join 
the Partnership for Peace program under NATO's umbrella? It 
demands a special status for itself, which worries Washington 
just as much as East and Central Europe. After his visit to 
Moscow, U.S. Secretary for Defense Perry spoke of a "pragmatic 
partnership"; the new formula admits that relations between the 
two superpowers have become more difficult, and it contains 
Washington's announcement of wanting to adapt itself to this. 
  The security adviser of former President Carter and 
spokesman 
of an opposition group within the ruling Democrats, Zbigniev 
Brzezinski, has now demanded an investigation into President 
Clinton's Russia policy, with the aim of reassessing Russia's 
future role in the light of possible new developments. Among 
these he counts the failure of democracy in Russia, or 
continuing political instability, together with internal 
radicalization. In this case, Washington's concept would be 
outdated anyhow. Also, there are considerations about how and 
for how long Boris Yeltsin can remain in power, and who his 
successor will be. 
  Brzezinski is not the only critic of an U.S. foreign policy 
that was for a long time uncritical toward Russia, and he is not 
warning in vain either. President Clinton himself has set a 
corrective sign by receiving in short order the presidents of 
Ukraine, Georgia, and Kazakhstan, all reform states under 
Moscow's pressure. He spoke out for the "territorial integrity" 
of Ukraine at a time when it was jeopardized from the periphery 
and the Crimea. Today, Washington holds the view that an 
independent Ukraine is more important for the West's security 
than a nuclear-free one. Another view is that Russia must not 
be allowed to patch its old empire back together. Next year, the 
small CIS states and the Baltic republics together are to 
receive as much in financial aid as Russia. The United States 
still needs Russia for disarmament and peacekeeping measures, 
but it has stopped overlooking its intentions and its neighbors.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jochen Thies: "America and Europe"] </F>
  [Text] In the United States, Europe is not a topical issue 
at the moment. There are other problems to be dealt with. The 
Clinton Administration's alleged weakness in foreign policy 
matters; its demonstrative lack of interest in many events in 
Europe, already became obvious when "foreign policy expert" 
George Bush was voted out. This indicated that American 
decision centers were shifting away from the traditional East 
Coast establishment to the depths of the continent and the West 
Coast. 
  Bill Clinton, the man from Arkansas, stands for a new 
development in American society that is associated with terms 
such as regionalism, group interests, discovery of ethnicity. 
All this has led to a certain domestic view of politics that is 
quite similar to trends that are becoming noticeable in Europe. 
  For many people this may come as a surprise, since they had 
read that Clinton went to college in Europe and acquired 
qualifications at Washington's Georgetown University that 
predestined him for foreign policy. After his first year, there 
is not much to be seen of this, apart from the fact that Russia 
comes first in the White House as it is still considered a 
superpower -- particularly because of its nuclear weapons. 
Clinton urges that the problem of proliferation be solved. If 
this attempt fails, the world faces new risks; but the United 
States' geopolitical security, being a continent separated from 
the crisis spots of the world by two oceans, will also be lost. 
  Clinton's foreign policy itinerary during his first 15 
months 
demonstrates the new American self-restraint in foreign policy 
very clearly. As was common for American presidents before 
1945, and also for American secretaries of state, he stayed in 
his own country; he only went to Seattle to welcome the Pacific 
states' heads of government, after having gone north to 
neighboring Vancouver a few months earlier to meet with Boris 
Yeltsin for the first time. 
  Then, early this year came his first trip to Europe, with 
the 
NATO summit in Brussels, visits to Prague, Moscow, and a few 
successor states to the Soviet Union that possess nuclear 
weapons. There was no time to meet the most important West 
European heads of government in their capitals. He will make up 
for this in the summer. When things got critical in Moscow 
shortly after the NATO summit, Helmut Kohl jetted to Washington. 
A few weeks earlier, Vice President Al Gore, coming from 
Moscow, had visited the chancellor in Oggersheim. 
  This is not enough for the American-European consultation 
process, whereas the European Union [EU] heads of government, 
and particularly their foreign ministers, definitely meet too 
often. In this most critical year in terms of foreign policy, 
the Clinton Administration does not spend enough time on foreign 
and security policy issues. At Clinton's insistence, the 
defense secretary had to go after just under a year in office. 
This had never happened since the Vietnam War. Clinton has not 
been very lucky with the rest of his staff, either. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher is a Methusalah. But his bad luck 
is partly due to the fact that the departments are understaffed. 
There is a constant coming and going in the State Department's 
Yugoslavia section. Meanwhile, the Clintons are stumbling 
through the shallow morasses of the Whitewater affair. 
  But it is not the Americans alone who are to blame for the 
poor foreign policy performance. Europeans are not exactly 
representative of states that are capable of acting at crucial 
times, either. But the Gulf War did not result in a new world 
order. The failed pacification of Somalia was a setback for the 
world's boldest expectations. China threatens to block the 
Security Council because of North Korea; Russia might do the 
same because of Serbia. Haiti was a tragedy for the United 
States; and the same goes for the Europeans, who have nightmares 
about the future of the Balkans. 
  Meanwhile, war, which seemed to be banned forever in 1945, 
has returned to Europe. America and Europe are afraid to suffer 
losses in conflicts that are not rated as vital interests by the 
television societies that are today's democracies. American 
fear of going it alone is forming an unholy alliance with 
European restraint for real and hypocritical reasons. The 
Germans, especially, take too much time clarifying their role. 
  Everyone still tends to have a transfigured view of things, 
although world politics after 1989 has clouded over in an 
unexpected way. The Western democracies prefer to celebrate in 
Normandy and avert their eyes when parallels to the 1930's 
become apparent. If the world had not accepted Hitler's 
occupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Omaha Beach would not have 
been necessary in 1944. But this statement is mainly directed 
at our own address.

<F P=106> [Winfrid Muenster commentary: "Symbolic Bridge for the </F>
British"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 28 March -- Great Britain has lost its 
struggle for a stronger veto right in the Council of Ministers 
of the European Union [EU]. During the weekend [26-27 March] 
the foreign ministers presented a compromise proposal to their 
London colleague Douglas Hurd as a last offer in Ioannina, 
Greece, a proposal in which they do not yield one millimeter of 
substance. They only built a bridge for Hurd, across which he 
can retreat. What the British wanted to prevent at all costs has 
now been set down: In an enlarged union it will no longer be 23 
votes but 27 that are necessary to build a blocking minority. 
The smaller minority then can still delay decisions, according 
to the formal concession -- and that until the Council decides 
the end of the debate with a simple majority in line with its 
standing orders. Then the matter is decided with the usual 
qualified majority of 70 percent. 
  However, this has been the usual procedure at the European 
Council of Ministers' meetings anyway, because for them how one 
treats the other is more important than the arithmetic of votes. 
In Brussels the government representatives are not overly 
surprised when the votes are taken. Quite the opposite: The 
decisions of the Council are usually clarified in the "Committee 
of Permanent Representatives" of the 12 governments, which comes 
before the Council of Ministers' meetings. If the ambassador of 
a larger member country, such as the United Kingdom, objects, 
the other 11 discuss the matter with him and postpone the 
pending decision. 
  The ambassadors virtually buy from each other, with 
compromises, the majority that they think politically 
appropriate. Occasionally, the opposition exhibited by any one 
of them is nothing but a game with marked cards to deceive the 
opposing forces at home. This means: Quite a few ministers do 
not mind being outvoted in Brussels. However, if things get 
tough sometimes, the oppressed government has the last resort of 
stressing a "vital national interest" and blocking the decision. 
Just last autumn France got into the headlines when it 
threatened to veto the European-U.S. agricultural agreements 
within the framework of the GATT round. The Germans definitely 
could have put in their veto in the past to prevent Brussels' 
bad banana protectionism. However the Bonn agriculture minister 
himself "betrayed" consumers' interests because he had to follow 
the producers' interests. 
  Douglas Hurd knows what conditions in Brussels are like and 
he knows very well that London's struggle for 23 instead of 27 
votes is quixotic. He has probably joined the insight of a 
growing part of his faction, namely that the foreign policy 
damage that Great Britain is doing to itself far exceeds the 
benefit of a compromise about balancing the votes, in particular 
since this benefit can hardly be measured. From the British 
viewpoint, it would make sense to struggle generally against the 
instrument of majority vote in the Brussels Council of 
Ministers, with the goal of turning the EU back into a forum of 
cooperation among states. Just modifying the qualified majority 
seems to be pointless since even opponents of European 
integration, such as the British, are occasionally very 
interested in pushing something through in Brussels. 
  Great Britain, for instance, is the pioneer of a liberal 
economic constitution in the EU. Precisely at the time when, by 
being enlarged to 16, the traditionally protectionist majority 
of the current 12 member states might turn into a liberal 
majority, which would be acceptable to the British as they want 
to make votes by qualified majority more difficult. Today, 
Tuesday, Secretary Hurd will try to make it clear to his 
stubborn party colleagues that in Europe, Great Britain has 
meanwhile acquired the bad reputation of being erratic and is 
dramatically losing political weight. "Lightweights," however, 
are actually very much in need of the instrument of majority 
vote.

<F P=106> [Report by Marc Deger: "GATT: Employers Organization Wants </F>
To Extend Social Clause"] 
  [Text] On the eve of the launch of the World Trade 
Organization [WTO], French employers are discussing the urgent 
need for the introduction of a social clause into the principles 
governing international trade. 
  "The mere prospect of the PRC joining GATT and then the WTO 
in the near future makes the solution of this problem a matter 
of the utmost urgency," Francois de Laage de Meux, president of 
the CNPF [National Council of French Employers] International 
Commission, stresses. 
  Although the establishment of the future WTO, which should 
replace GATT by 1 July 1995 at the latest according to the final 
act of the Uruguay Round, has gained political acceptance, its 
sphere of competence still has to be defined. 
<H5>  Governing the "Fairness of Trade" </H5>
  Gerard Longuet [the foreign trade and industry minister] 
said 
at the last cabinet meeting that "during the Marrakesh 
conference, France will pay particular attention to including on 
the WTO's agenda all questions which may have an impact on the 
fairness of trade." 
  Indeed there are four such questions: environmental 
protection, social clause, monetary parity, and unfair 
competition. With regard to the environment, an agreement was 
reached in Geneva last week on the setting up of a multilateral 
negotiation group. 
  With regard to monetary parity, the IMF's preserve, a 
decision in Marrakesh is out of the question. Unfair 
competition (agreements, dominant monopolistic positions) could 
be discussed but without necessarily immediately starting 
negotiations. 
<H5>  Multilateral Social Code of Ethics Being Planned </H5>
  That leaves the social clause on which Paris and Washington 
seem to have similar views. Although the content of the 
provisions has not been specified, the developing countries see 
it as a new means of "imperialist" domination. 
  Francois de Laage de Meux, president of the CNPF's 
International Commission, states that the "CNPF's target is not 
the wage disparities due to differences in development." 
However, the future members of the WTO could agree on "a 
multilateral social code of ethics adopting the International 
Labor Organization's [ILO] main conventions." 
  For instance those relating to the prohibition of child 
labor 
and enforced labor, or the obligation for collective negotiation 
and trade union freedom. And the employers' leader added that, 
not only in the PRC, but also in some other countries (India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Peru), enforced prison labor 
and child labor affect relatively large sections of the 
population. 
  The CNPF adds that other ILO conventions should also be 
included in the WTO's agenda: minimum wages, paid leave, rest 
days, equal pay, maternity provisions. It is difficult to see 
how the developing countries could avoid feeling that they are 
the targets.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Job Training Contracts To Be </F>
Replaced Next Week"] 
  [Text] The students have won but the government has not 
lost face. Following the second round of the cantonal 
elections, which did not live up to all that the majority and 
especially the Matignon [prime minister's office] expected, 
Edouard Balladur yesterday called together the young leaders of 
the university and high school student movements which are 
organizing demonstrations against the CIP (Job Training 
Contracts). It was a two-hour working meeting which, although 
it did not defuse the student protest since Thursday's [24 
March] protest meeting will take place, opens the door to an 
honorable compromise to replace the CIP rejected by the young 
people with another more appropriate system. This is a 
compromise which enables the government to come out with its 
head high from this social stalemate, while giving the young 
people guarantees of "good will." This is a strategic maneuver 
preceding the final withdrawal of the plan, which the Hotel 
Matignon wishes to approach in two stages: suspension of the 
CIP for a week, long enough to start negotiations with the 
representative organizations; replacement of the CIP after this 
period by another plan which will have been negotiated and 
approved. 
  Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said at the end of this 
working meeting that "the government does not intend to make the 
CIP a taboo. There are 750,000 unemployed people in France 
below the age of 25, in other words four times as many as in 
Germany. Of this figure, there are 690,000 young unemployed 
people without qualifications. We cannot tell them that we are 
no longer bothering with them." Therefore, because the CIP 
presents problems, "it must be replaced by a new formula which 
addresses youngsters' concerns. The government wishes to 
succeed" through consultation. "The negotiations are open and 
young people are not without imagination. All formulas are on 
the table. When there is good will...." 
  The government is therefore proposing to reopen the issue on 
the basis of three points: 
  1. The CIP is suspended for one week. During this time, a 
mission headed by Michel Le Bon, director general of the ANPE 
[National Employment Agency], will work on drawing up a new 
formula in consultation with the employers' and employees' 
organizations and with representatives of the university and 
high school students. "Only detailed consultation and the 
support of the majority will make it possible to find a solution 
to the problem of youth unemployment," Edouard Balladur 
stresses. The prime minister is also putting forward the idea 
of setting up a job-seeking service for young people, which 
would be equivalent to a youth ANPE. 
  2. The prime minister wants a general meeting on youth held 
shortly because "its problems are not limited to employment." 
He therefore wishes to alert the public authorities, the local 
councils, the associations, and young people themselves to 
preparation for such a meeting. It will be organized in the 
coming weeks by an interministerial committee bringing together 
the government chief, National Education Minister Francois 
Bayrou, Higher Education Minister Francois Fillon, and Youth and 
Sports Minister Michele Alliot-Marie. 
  3. The government pledges to study new ways of establishing 
a dialogue with young people which "enables them to participate 
in a number of bodies, in which they are not currently 
represented." 
<H5>  No `Revealed Truth' </H5>
  Young people have sent us several messages by demanding the 
abrogation of the CIP, Nicolas Sarkozy added. They are 
expressing "a desire for dialogue" and a need for recognition. 
"They are saying to us: Trust us, we have ideas too. We will 
not hold back this confidence." Under pressure on the one hand 
from a section of his majority to take a firm stance against the 
youth demonstrations and to speed up his reform program, and 
worried on the other about the risks of escalation prompted by 
the growing number of demonstrations, Mr. Balladur is seeking a 
way out which enables him to calm things down without giving the 
impression of "backing down." Last week, speaking to several 
journalists, he expressed surprise at the tension surrounding 
the CIP when there was no malice in the government's approach. 
He remarked that it was not his plan which was being booed in 
the streets, but the bill amended and rewritten by the deputies. 
"I do not identify with the idea of revealed truth," he said. 
"When you realize that a law" does not correspond to the 
country's expectations, and is not understood "it must be 
changed." But how to back down without giving the impression of 
crumbling under the pressure of a minority and without exposing 
yourself to the criticism of your political friends? The second 
round of the cantonal elections, which resulted in a drop in 
votes for the majority, gave him the opportunity to back down 
without risking too much criticism from a section of the 
majority. On Sunday evening, Mr. Balladur announced a series of 
initiatives to help young people. On Monday morning, he 
telephoned student leaders to invite them to come and talk. 
  They arrived punctually. They put forward three 
preconditions for the opening of dialogue: withdrawal of the 
CIP; release of the imprisoned demonstrators; and return to 
France of the two Algerians expelled. "We have not come here to 
sidestep the issue," one of the 17 "guests" said as he entered 
the Matignon. And yet, aside from the FIDL [Independent 
Federation of High School Students] (organization close to the 
Socialist Party), which walked out after one hour of 
discussions, the other groups chose the path of negotiation. "I 
can only give you an answer on one point," Mr. Balladur told 
them in substance, "that of the CIP. The other two depend on the 
legal authorities and it is not for the government to exert any

universities, the students agreed to participate in the proposed 
consultation. "We obtained partial satisfaction," Philippe 
Campinchi, from the UNEF-ID [National Union of French 
Students-Independent and Democratic]. "We welcome the 
government's change of tone... We say yes to the mission to 
extricate young people from unemployment and despair. It is a 
first step. It must be continued."

  [Text] The French people's confidence in Prime Minister 
Balladur registered a 12-point drop in March, according to the 
CSA-"La Vie" opinion poll. Of those interviewed (between the 
two cantonal election rounds), 40 percent have confidence in 
Edouard Balladur's capacity "to cope efficiently with the main 
problems the country is facing," while 45 percent think 
otherwise. Meanwhile, Francois Mitterrand's rating indicates 
an opposite trend, with 45 percent of those responding with 
positive appraisals against 39 percent negative. This is the 
first time since March 1993 that the head of state leads his 
prime minister in a poll.

<F P=106> [Report by Roland-Pierre Paringaux: "The Republican Party's </F>
Secret Accounts"] 
  [Excerpt] Suitcases of banknotes, secret funds, forged 
accounts, secret contributions by large companies, and the 
ambiguous role of Republican Party (PR) leaders, including three 
serving ministers: Judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke, whose 
investigations led him to study the funding of the PR, has just 
informed the Rennes Public Prosecutor's Office in writing about 
information which could well provide the Right with its URBA 
[urban transportation project which was abandoned] scandal. 
  Indeed, aside from Jean-Pierre Thomas, deputy for les Vosges 
and PR treasurer, who has been at the forefront of this scandal 
for six months, the document handed to Rennes Public Prosecutor 
Jacques Brun on 24 March mentions the names of Gerard Longuet, 
president of the PR and industry minister; Francois Leotard, 
honorary president of the PR and defense minister; and Alain 
Madelin, vice president of the PR and minister of enterprises 
and economic development. Their names appear in connection with 
financial and property transactions that may result in criminal 
charges of forgery, misuse of public property, and influence 
peddling. The four-page report drawn up by Renaud Van Ruymbeke 
brings to the attention of the Rennes public prosecutor, and the 
justice minister, facts which the judge discovered during his 
investigations, although they do not come directly within his 
sphere of competence. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On 28 March, Ladislas Poniatowski, the spokesman of 
the Republican Party [PR], stated that the report on PR 
financing submitted by Judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke to the public 
prosecutor's office "does not contain any revelation," but is 
indicative of a "dysfunctioning of the judicial system." 
  According to Mr. Poniatowski, who spoke on RTL [Luxembourg 
Radio and Television], "the figures mentioned in the report were 
not discovered or revealed by the judge, but were officially 
transmitted by the PR treasurer," Jean-Pierre Thomas. "The 
report," the Eure deputy continued, "does not reveal anything 
new on the issue of political party financing. It is known that 
before 1990, all political parties were obliged to find 
operating funds in a way which was not always conventional. 
Since 1990, the advantage of the law is that all accounts are 
now clear." Mr. Poniatowski summarizes the behavior of the 
judge, which he qualifies as "very serious," as follows: "Let 
us smear, smear, and some of it will always stick, even if the 
smear is absolutely unfounded." 
  On 29 March Alain Madelin, companies and economic 
development 
minister and PR vice president, also stated to RTL: "Was the 
Republican Party's financing in line with the laws on party 
financing? The PR's response is yes. Let justice do its job. 
As far as I am concerned, I have absolutely nothing to do with 
PR financing. Because of this, I have confidence in the 
judicial system of my country. I bear the responsibility for the 
Republican Party, and I assume it totally."

  [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- The French National 
Assembly gave permission on Wednesday for the arrest of French 
MP Edouard Chammougon, who faces charges of corruption and 
embezzling public funds. 
  A committee of parliament chaired by Speaker Philippe Seguin 
lifted the parliamentary [immunity] of Chammougon, the 
independent MP for the French West Indies island of Guadeloupe, 
whose arrest was authorised. 
  Chammougon is accused in connection with commissions paid by 
the town of Baie-Mehault, of which he has been mayor since 1977. 
The town's budget is in the red to the tune of 208 million 
francs (about 35 million dollars). 
  The MP is also being asked to explain the origin of two 
million francs (330,00O dollars) that were paid into his bank 
accounts. 
  Two other French MPS face embezzlement charges, but have not 
been jailed. 
  Olympique Marseille President Bernard Tapie, a former 
minister in the socialist government, faces two embezzlement 
cases and has also been accused of bribery and interfering with 
witnesses in an attempt to throw a match. 
  On Tuesday conservative Michel Noir, the mayor of Lyon and 
also a former minister, was charged with embezzling public money 
and ordered to put up bail of 2.4 million francs (420,000 
dollars). 
  Three ministers in the government of Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur have meanwhile been named in a judicial report exposing 
illegal financing of the right-wing Republican Party, part of 
the ruling coalition. 
  The report by Rennes examining magistrate Renaud Van 
Ruymbeke, who has also probed illegal financing of the former 
ruling Socialist Party, said Gerard Longuet (Industry), 
president of the party, Francois Leotard (Defence), honorary 
president, and Trade Minister Alain Madelin were all aware of 
cash payments into Republican Party coffers of 28 million francs 
(4.9 million dollars) between 1987 and 1991.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Leotard Judges European NH-90 </F>
Helicopter Program `Essential' Despite Budget Constraints"] 
  [Text] In a letter to Olivier Darrason, UDF [French 
Democratic Union] deputy for Bouches-du-Rhone, assigned to study 
the NH-90 project, Defense Minister Leotard expressed his belief 
that the European NH-90 logistical helicopter program "is 
essential, both for the operational capability of our forces and 
for the future of the Eurocopter group. In addition," Leotard 
writes, "the government believes that aeronautics programs are a 
top priority. Despite current financial and budget 
difficulties, initial judgments by the prime minister on the 
military programming law will allow us to continue defense 
modernization." 
  Speaking to the National Assembly's Defense Committee, 
Jean-Francois Bigay, president of the Eurocopter group, pointed 
out that "the total cost of the NH-90 program would amount to 
ECU1.376 billion," more than 9 billion French francs [Fr]. 
French participation comes to 42.4 percent (Fr1.3 billion by 
Eurocopter and Fr3.9 billion by the state). "The unit cost of 
the NH-90 helicopter will be Fr85 million" for the Land Army 
version, "and Fr135 million" for the Navy version, Mr. Bigay 
specified. 
  The four countries participating in the program (France, 
Germany, The Netherlands, and Italy) have an overall requirement 
for 726 helicopters, while the non-European export market is 
estimated at approximately 500 "machines." The program is 
currently severely threatened by military budget cuts in the 
four participating countries.

  [Text] Paris, March 30 (AFP) -- The French Government 
sacked Jean-Yves Haberer, former president of the loss-ridden 
Credit Lyonnais Bank, from his new post as managing director of 
the Credit National Institution, on Wednesday [30 March]. 
  Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said after a cabinet 
meeting that he had asked that Haberer be removed from his post 
at the head of the state-controlled Credit National and that the 
cabinet had agreed. 
  On Tuesday Haberer had called for a commission of enquiry 
into the way the Credit Lyonnais, which has reported a loss of 
6.9 billion francs (1.23 billion dollars), had been managed. 
Alphandery, in response to a question about this, replied: "This 
enquiry will be held." 
  The conservative neo-Gaullist RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
political group tabled a proposal on Wednesday calling for a 
parliamentary investigation to "throw light on the real causes" 
of the losses. 
  The leader of the RPR group, Bernard Pons, said that 
"officially" the net consolidated loss for 1993 is 6.9 billion 
francs but that the real sum, on the basis of press reports of 
the latest study by the treasury, "might be more than 20 billion 
francs." 
  He said: "This exceptional situation, without precedent in 
French banking history, requires that the state intervene in 
line with the scale of the announced loss and once again it is 
the taxpayer who, in the end, will be asked to foot the deficit 
of a state company." 
  Pons said: "The real question is to know how the Credit 
Lyonnais came to make so many commitments to clients whose 
insolvency was notorious or whose reputation was at the least 
equivocal." 
  Questions should be asked about some investments made 
between 1988 and 1993 and on the role played by the government 
of the day, he said. 
  This was seen as a reference to the previous socialist 
administration which was voted out of office a year ago. 
  Government spokesman and Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy 
said 
that "errors of management were committed" at Credit Lyonnais 
during the period when Haberer was president. 
  Haberer, who ran the Credit Lyonnais until November, in a 
statement on Tuesday, attacked what he described as a "media 
lynching" of him over the losses. 
  Referring to the responsibility of the state, he said: 
"Account is not taken of the recommendations which I received at 
least until March 1993 from the majority shareholder" to 
"support influential sectors of the economy and thereby 
contribute to growth and employment, particularly during the 
years of crisis which our country is experiencing." 
  He said that he was being blamed for risks to which the bank 
had become committed before he was appointed on September 15 
1988. 
  Acknowledging that errors had been made, and that internal 
controls needed to be tightened, he said that an enquiry should 
establish who had been responsible for what. 
  Observers noted that of problem loans, commitments to the 
cinema through Credit Lyonnais Nederland Bank (CLNB) originated 
under the presidency of Jean Deflassieux and were continued by 
Haberer's predecessor Jean Maxime Leveque. 
  Another problem linked to controversial politician and 
business tycoon Bernard Tapie, through the Credit Lyonnais 
subsisiary SDBO, goes back many years, and problems connected 
with the late British press magnate Robert Maxwell began under 
Leveque. 
  The current president of the bank, Jean Peyrelevade, said on 
Tuesday that management mistakes had been made, mainly through 
subsidiaries "under several governments of different colours."

<F P=106> [Report signed "M.-L.C and D.S.": "Foreign Trade: France </F>
Improves Its Trade Balance With the Asian Dragons"] 
  [Text] France occupies a halfway position in Europe in 
terms of trade with Asia. But last year saw a significant 
improvement. According to the INSEE [National Statistics 
Office], France is taking better advantage than other European 
countries of trade opportunities with this region. 
  In Asia -- China, the newly industrialized countries (Korea, 
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan), and the ASEAN countries 
(Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Brunei) -- European 
countries all have a limited market share and trade deficit. 
This situation is radically different from that of Japan, for 
which Southeast Asia is a natural expansion zone and which earns 
substantial surpluses in this region; or that of the United 
States, which is very much present, though with heavy deficits. 
  Among European countries, France occupies a halfway position 
with regard to trade with Asia. More present in China than in 
other zones, it ranks behind Germany and the United Kingdom but 
ahead of its other neighbors. In any case, according to foreign 
trade statistics, its position improved in 1993. The 
export-import ratio in our trade with Asian and Pacific rim 
developing countries was 88 percent, compared with 80 percent in 
1992 and 68 percent in 1980. By comparison France's 
export-import ratio for the world as a whole has risen from 97 
percent in 1992 to 102 percent in 1993. In numerical terms, the 
deficit amounted to 8.6 billion francs [Fr], compared with Fr17 
billion two years earlier, on a growing trade volume. 
  With the "rapidly developing" Asian countries (excluding 
China) the upward swing has been even more visible, with a 
export-import ratio of 108 percent (95 percent in 1992). 
Exports have risen by 14.6 percent (to Fr47.8 billion), while 
imports have slowed down (Fr44.3 billion). With China, however, 
the French trade deficit has increased: minus Fr12.2 billion 
last year, compared with minus Fr11.2 billion in 1992 and minus 
Fr9.3 billion in 1991. In total, our trade with Asia is growing 
regularly from year to year, in terms of both imports and 
exports (excluding military equipment), the Industry Ministry 
pointed out. Imports from Asia accounted for 11.1 percent of 
total French imports (10 percent in 1991) and 8.2 percent of 
exports (7.1 percent in 1991). 
<H5>  China: Mainly Semiprocessed Products </H5>
  According to the INSEE (footnote 1) ("INSEE Premiere" No. 
303, March 1994) French exports, which are relatively 
unspecialized, present a certain number of specific features. 
Toward newly industrialized countries, France exports more 
consumer goods and mixed products (intermediate or final use) 
and less equipment and semiprocessed goods than its competitors. 
In consumer goods, France remains in a deficit position despite 
large exports of toiletries, clothes, and cars, which give it 
higher export-import ratios than its partners, with the 
exception of Japan (in surplus) and Italy. 
  In the case of China, France stands out with exports of 
semiprocessed products, whereas other industrialized countries 
tend to sell more equipment. With the ASEAN countries, French 
exports consist primarily of equipment (46 percent compared with 
an average of 41 percent for France's main trading partners). 
France's export-import ratio is poor in terms of consumer 
goods, but more favorable in terms of equipment thanks to 
Airbus. Which, for INSEE, proves that France "appears to be 
making good use of its comparative advantages in its trading 
relationships with ASEAN countries."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Alain Peyrefitte: "Votes Versus Street </F>
Demonstrations"] 
  [Text] No one expected the second round of cantonal 
elections to contradict the results of the first round, the 
lessons of which hold true but for a few nuances. 
  Point one: The controversy generated by the youth 
professional training contract (CIP) turned these 
run-of-the-mill elections into a political test. The prime 
minister had been careful not to participate in the campaign, 
not wishing to tie his career to an interrim election that could 
be the medium for an exaggerated expression of malcontent. The 
results were so unexpected that he was unable to resist 
interpreting them as the test that, beforehand, he had played 
down. That is fair enough. 
  In fact, the second round confirmed that the people refuse 
to 
censure the Balladur government, unlike in the previous local 
elections of 1982, 1985, and 1992, which were used in that way 
against the Socialist government. The dissatisfaction of 
various categories of society did not prevent the rejection of 
Socialist policy nor did it prevent a vote of confidence for the 
government. 
  Point two: The Left can pride itself on its renewal. The 
Communist Party has halted its decline and [Socialist Party 
Secretary General] Michel Rocard is right when he says that his 
party has made up half of the ground it had lost. 
  The second round evened things up even more. 
  The Right is reassured. It has not been bowed by this first 
year in power. The rumor of a dissolution of parliament, 
supposedly to again bring the "real world" into line with the 
"legal world," is fading. This election gave the government the 
room for maneuver that even its own majority had balked at 
granting it. 
  However, the Left is even more reassured. The PS is again 
becoming France's largest political party. It is fully capable 
of playing its role of opposition. It is no longer absurd to 
think that it could win a presidential or legislative election. 
Tactical withdrawals [at the elections in favor of a 
better-placed candidate on the same side] and the "republican 
discipline" went like clockwork, generating a fair degree of 
surprise. 
  We have returned to the bipolar logic of the regime. The 
Right has returned to its role of managing and the Left has 
returned to its role of contesting -- doing what they both do 
best. 
  The electoral page has been turned. France is faced with its 
destiny. The real difficulties are just beginning. 
  The streets are ready to explode although the voters have 
spoken. The government now knows that, while it is opposed by 
the French who are demonstrating and making trouble, it enjoys 
the support of the French who voted. The latter would not 
forgive it if it favored the former. The voters expect the 
government to energetically continue its policy of reform, for 
which they voted a year ago and whose legitimacy they have just 
reconfirmed on its first birthday. 
  You do not govern by bending to the whims of manipulated 
crowds. However, at the end of the day, nor do you govern a 
country by opposing youth. The prime minister will need a lot 
of skill and a lot of tenacity if he is to calm the aberrant 
expression of justified adolescent anguish. Let us hope that 
the initiatives he announces will give him the opportunity to do 
just that.

  [Text] Rome, March 29 (AFP) -- President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro said Tuesday [29 March] that he hoped Italy's next 
parliament would "guarantee stablility for policies and 
stability for the Italian people." 
  Scalfaro, who will designate the next head of government 
following the landslide victory by a right-wing bloc headed by 
media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, said in a statement to the 
press that the new administration "was entitled to work in 
peace." 
  He hailed the climate of "tranquility and normality" in 
which 
the election had been conducted despite a complex new electoral 
law. 
  Scalfaro is to convene a meeting on April 15 of the new 
chambers of Italy's 12th legislature since World War II.

will be formed quickly. He has not put himself forward for the 
office of prime minister but is backing Silvio Berlusconi, and 
has ruled out Northern League politicians. He has pointed out 
that the League is only present in some areas of Italy. 
  After stressing that he has not spoken to Umberto Bossi on 
the telephone, either yesterday or today, Fini asked the 
Northern League leader to be completely frank about the value of 
national unity and solidarity between the north and the south, 
which is fundamental to the National Alliance. He also pointed 
out that Berlusconi's bid to be prime minister is in keeping 
with the results of the election.

  [Text] Gianfranco Fini is once again confronting the 
eternal triangle of himself, Silvio Berlusconi, and the other 
man, Umberto Bossi, who is continually raising the stakes for a 
possible pact. Fini is maintaining his usual calm, even if he 
has said that Bossi is not fit to be prime minister. He has 
pointed out that although the National Alliance has accepted 
decentralization, it will continue to defend Italian unity. He 
is awaiting the outcome of the patient tactics of Silvio 
Berlusconi, the spinner of webs. 
  [Begin Fini recording] I believe that at this stage it is up 
to Berlusconi, who has obtained the most votes, to set up a 
series of meetings. We met this afternoon and discussed the 
tremendous election results. We discussed the fact that 
Italians have chosen who they want to govern them. I believe 
that in the next few days Berlusconi will also meet Bossi, after 
which we will meet again. There will certainly be two of us 
present -- I do not know if there will be three people at the 
meeting. As far as we are concerned, the problems connected 
with the Northern League remain the same: We want an absolute 
guarantee that Italy remains united and a policy of solidarity 
between north and south. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Fini warned, however, that without Bossi they 
would not have sufficient numbers to form a government.

  [Text] Milan, March 30 (AFP) -- Media magnate Silvio 
Berlusconi, the main victor in Italy's legislative elections, 
has offered to sell one of his television networks to ease 
opposition to his forming a new government. 
  Berlusconi has said he wants to become prime minister 
following the landslide election victory Monday [28 March] of 
the rightwing alliance led by his Forza Italia party. 
  But a key coalition partner, Umberto Bossi of the Northern 
League, has objected that Berlusconi's vast financial and media 
holdings made him unsuited to lead a government. 
  Questioned during a television interview late Tuesday about 
Bossi's remarks, Berlusconi replied, "If I could find someone 
ready to buy, I could give up one of my television stations." 
  Burlusconi's huge conglomerate, Fininvest, owns three 
national television networks as well as other media, 
telecommunications, property and distribution holdings. 
  He also said he was willing to sell other unidentified 
"companies" in the Fininvest group. 
  When he entered the political campaign last January, 
Berlusconi handed the presidency of Fininvest over to an 
associate. 
  The right-wing coalition that won a majority in Italy's 
latest election comprises Berlusconi's Forza Italy party, the 
federalist Northern League and the neo-facist party National 
Alliance.

  [Editorial report] Rome RAI Uno Television Network in 
Italian at 2105 GMT on 29 March carries a 45-minute special 
edition of the election program "Beyond Words" featuring 
interviews with Achille Occhetto, leader of the Democratic Party 
of the Left; Mino Marinazzoli, leader of the Italian Popular 
Party; Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National Alliance; and 
Silvio Berlusconi, leader of Forza Italia. 
  The interviews start with Democratic Party of the Left 
leader 
Achille Occhetto. Occhetto is asked by journalist Bruno Vespa 
whether he feels Berlusconi could give Italy a stable 
government. Occhetto says that as leader of the largest 
grouping, Berlusconi should be called on by the president to 
form a government. Occhetto says it will be difficult for three 
very different parties in the alliance to gel into an effective 
coalition, and that he will lead a strong oppostion, which will 
make life difficult for the new government should Berlusconi 
fail to maintain any of his promises. Occhetto says he most 
fears "the social conflict caused by the Right all over Europe." 
"I am afraid of French-style or Thatcherite policies," he says. 
  Forza Italia leader Berlusconi is interviewed next. 
Berlusconi hopes he will be able to form a government quickly, 
because the electorate has made its wish very clear. Berlusconi 
tells journalist Bruno Vespa that he has resigned as chairman of 
Fininvest and saw no conflict of interests. But, Berlusconi 
says, "I have heard that some people say that if I want to be 
prime minister, I must sell my companies. Let them come 
forward. If there is someone willing to buy them from me, I 
have nothing against it." He says that if someone offered to 
buy a television channel from him he will hand one over and will 
be happy if "the price is right, if it reflected the true value 
of something that had been built with blood, sweat, and tears." 
  Vespa asks Berlusconi if he would step aside if he realized 
that his bid to be prime minister would be a hindrance to 
forming a government. Berlusconi says: "I would step aside 
immediately if the proposed alternative solution was the better 
solution." 
  Bruno Vespa finishes the interviews by asking National 
Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini if he would accept Northern 
League leader Umberto Bossi's candidate for the post of prime 
minister, Roberto Maroni. Fini says he does not think a party 
with a purely regional power base has the right to lead the 
country as a whole. 
  Fini says he does not understand what the League means by 
federalism and that this will have to be thrashed out since his 
own party is committed to the unity of Italy, although it does 
believe in more decentralization. 
  He says the economy should be the new government's priority 
and that measures should be taken not only to provide tax relief 
for small- and medium-sized companies so that they could 
reinvest profits, but also to make it easier to employ people by 
abolishing certain regulations.

  [Excerpt] The Northern League's position remains crucial. 
Yesterday evening [Northern League leader] Umberto Bossi set out 
his conditions [for joining a government coalition] on the spur 
of the moment. Mariano Squillante reports from Northern League 
headquarters where a news conference is underway. Mariano, what 
has Bossi said? 
  [Squillante] The news conference ended a few minutes ago. 
Bossi said that over the next 24 hours he would contact people 
and start negotiations with the two other components of the 
Freedom Alliance, which won the elections. Let us hear what he 
says in this short excerpt: 
  [Begin Bossi recording] The alliance must now say and 
forcefully spell out that it is more than just the sole 
political force which can govern this country. This is valid not 
only for Forza Italia but also for other political forces. I 
mean, the MSI [Italian Social Movement] has lost no time in 
becoming the National Alliance, and we would like to know -- we 
will try to understand -- if the party itself has actually 
changed. [end recording] 
  [Squillante] [passage omitted] He said that only the League 
has the moral right and the political unity needed to conduct 
negotiations to form a government, while Forza Italia and the 
National Alliance cannot be trusted in that they are unknown 
quantities. He has once again given the thumbs down to Silvio 
Berlusconi as prime minister, saying that he would prefer the 
Northern League's Roberto Maroni. 
  Meanwhile, Francesco Speroni has put himself forward as a 
candidate for the post of speaker in the Senate. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "It Will Be Tough for Whoever </F>
Governs"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome -- "What can I say? If the opinion polls 
are right, Chancey Gardiner [fictional character] would say that 
the Right has won and the progressive forces have lost. And if 
they are wrong, that the progressive forces have won and the 
Right has lost. Well, I go along with that. And I would add 
that, whatever happens, it will be very tough for Silvio 
Berlusconi and his men to govern...." [passage omitted] 
  It was immediately clear that, as far as the Democratic 
Alliance [AD] leaders were concerned, the exit polls must be 
taken with a pinch of salt: "The discrepancy between the 
maximum and minimum for the two sides," Giorgio Bogi pointed out 
sarcastically, "is the same as exists between life and 
death...." "I am almost certain," Ferdinando Adornato added, 
that this evening's newspaper headlines will announce a major 
victory for the Right and that by tomorrow it will have 
disappeared. Having said that, it is obvious that there has 
been a success on their part. But this shows that the AD was 
right about everything -- and from the outset. We were right to 
oppose the cartel including Communist Renewal, we were right to 
fight for a single symbol instead of our dividing behind so many 
little banners. And above all, we were right to argue that the 
progressive forces could not win without the center, that the 
agreement with Mario Segni, [Pact for Italy leader], was 
essential. We were not heeded, and this is what has happened; 
the center has disappeared and the Right has won. But we must go 
back to this -- with Mino Martinazzoli, [secretary of the 
Italian Popular Party, PPI] in Segni's place, perhaps. Be that 
as it may, to an understanding between the progressive forces 
and the center...." 
  The same stance was adopted by Willer Bordon, who seemed 
astonished by the observation that he did not seem to be 
mourning the AD's failure in the proportional quota: "We never 
had in mind some minor party commanding 4 percent: We were 
formed with a greater ambition, and it is no coincidence that 
everyone now is talking in terms of a democratic party, a single 
parliamentary group for all the progressive forces. In this 
respect, we certainly have not been defeated. Of course, it 
would certainly have been better if we had succeeded in the 
proportional quotas, too; but if we really did gain 3 percent, 
it means that we have half as many votes as Bossi. And that is 
not bad for a party that was formed only a year ago." 
  The fact remains that the Right is now preparing to govern, 
dispelling the illusion that the "ordinary society" on which 
Adornato pinned his hopes was progressive. But Adornato is not 
surrendering: "True, ordinary society did vote prevalently for 
the Right. But this confirms that ordinary society needed to be 
offered a less old, a less `political' image than that provided 
by the Left. Like it or not, the contest was more between `old 
and new' than between `Right and Left.' And Berlusconi seemed 
newer than Achille Occhetto [secretary of the aDemocratic Party 
of the Left, PDS]." Is anyone to blame for the Right's victory? 
"Many people," Adornato replied, "but two in particular -- 
Occhetto and Segni. They did not trust each other, each was 
afraid of being subordinate to the other. Then one of them 
thought that he could be prime minister or, at most, yield his 
position to Carlo Ciampi, while the other was reduced to playing 
the Mario Scelba. It is they that have brought us to this...."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Indro Montanelli: "Chaos, as Expected"] </F>
  [Text] Of course, the few words that have been written (at 
11 o'clock in the evening) are based on elements that are more 
of a horoscope than news. The horoscope refers to a widespread 
victory of the Right, or rather the three formations that form 
the Right only because they are set against the Left. In this 
case, the great defeated one is not Achille Occhetto [secretary 
of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] but the center, which 
Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI] 
had hoped to turn into a force capable of influencing the other 
two by being essential to the formation of a majority. Instead 
the tri-part "front," as it seems, can make it alone. And 
perhaps this is better. Therefore, we will finally see what 
this facsimile of the Right is and what its men are worth. 
  This will immediately give us an appraisal of them if, even 
without the absolute majority of the proportional representation 
votes but at least the majority of the seats, they can create a 
parliamentary majority finally capable of providing a stable 
government. Only on this premise can we speak of a Second 
Republic. If this premise is lacking, as [Northern League 
Secretary] Umberto Bossi's broadsides against [National Alliance 
Secretary] Gianfranco Fini appear to foreshadow, this will mean 
that we are still in the First Republic: the republic of 
transformism and under-the-table maneuvers, and therefore the 
republic of frail majorities and paralytic governments that are 
based on the market of indulgence toward friends and the 
"exchanging of votes" with enemies. 
  But let us not make any forecasts on the final results that 
could still hold some surprises. For the time being let us 
limit ourselves to making two simple observations: The first is 
the decrease in the percentage of voters despite the extension 
of the voting period. We think that this can be attributed to 
an election campaign that was based almost exclusively on 
reciprocal accusations and defamations; that instead of throwing 
light, threw dark upon the minds of the voters, and dissuaded 
many who were at a loss and did not know where to turn. The 
second is the increase in invalid voting slips. This is the 
unavoidable outcome of the confusion created by an electoral 
system that was prepared precisely with the intention of 
creating confusion. When we foresaw this, they contradicted us. 
But LA VOCE was right.

<F P=106> [Article by Enzo Roggi: "We Run the Risk of </F>
Ungovernability"] 
  [Text] The Second Republic has been born under the sign of 
ungovernability. As we write, a right-wing majority is emerging 
that has immediately shown deep divisions toward forming a 
prospective government. The transition to the new configuration 
of the Italian system thus appears incomplete, riddled with 
difficulties, marked, it is true, by the success scored by the 
various forces that rallied around Berlusconi, but also by a 
strong presence of the Left. In addition to electoral 
consensus, this is the result of a unity that represents an 
unprecedented and valuable heritage that should be put 
immediately to the test. The outcome expresses the climate of 
confused hostility that marked the last stage in particular of 
the election campaign: the total disregard for the rules, the 
body blows, the prevarication in the propaganda, the cunning 
rumors spread to further behind-the-scenes speculations. 
  In the midst of so many difficulties, it is by no means 
rhetorical to mention the performance by the progressive 
alliance, which, while failing to attract all the votes that it 
required, has nevertheless introduced an element of rationality, 
reason, national responsibility, and good sense. Within this 
alliance, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] emerges once 
again as the largest and best structured force, capable of 
mobilizing valuable grass-roots energy that has enabled it to 
honor its role as the major force uniting, leading, and 
gallantly supporting its allies. It remains to be seen how all 
this will translate into seats, but meanwhile, this acquired 
capital must be preserved and invested in the harsh reality that 
the poll opens up. 
  The undeniable success of the so-called Freedom Pole is the 
fruit of a combination of factors that cannot be reduced to 
sticking together. The single factor that all the components of 
the cartel clearly had in common was fear of success by the 
progressive alliance: a negative feeling, a sort of psychosis 
brought to the point of paroxysm by the unprecedented force of 
its propaganda, which succeeded, to a certain extent, in 
resurrecting old fears, ghosts that wormed their way into the 
psychological and political void left by the old regime. As to 
the rest, in other words its platform, political consistency, 
and ideological identity, the right-wing camp presented no 
credentials as a cohesive, credible governing alliance. The 
conflict, the reciprocal, irremovable repulsion between the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] and the League, is the most obvious 
aspect of this lack of internal cohesion, which seems likely to 
have enormous political and parliamentary repercussions and to 
create a situation detrimental to the Right's ambitions. 
Although the mediating role performed by Berlusconi (who has 
promised a semi-alliance with the League in the north and a 
semi-alliance with the MSI in the south) has made it possible to 
pull in the whole moderate and conservative vote, it has not 
solved the political issue of the unity of a right-wing 
government. The statements in which Bossi has ruled out a full 
governing deal with the "reactionary right" of National Alliance 
in the name of a democratic undertaking on which the League does 
not intend to renege, may well mean that the Right's success 
will by no means translate automatically into the formation of a 
governing majority. The Berlusconi front's strong point, so to 
speak, lay in bringing together the votes of the opposing 
tendencies, the old seeking continuation by other means and the 
new protest movement that reduces everything to driving out the 
previous political personnel. The outcome is that this Right 
emerges as something very similar to what dominated the last 
decade of the first republic, with the addition of explicit 
regressive intentions in the social welfare field. All in all, 
it is a large but divided Right lacking unity in its goals and 
in its methods for pursuing them. 
  The centrist PPI [Italian People's Party] and Mario 
Segni-led 
forces may be assessed as follows: They refused to believe in 
the logic of bipolar democracy. Indeed they rejected it with 
incomprehensible determination, and now they have to come to 
terms with the de facto bipolarism imposed by the electorate, 
albeit via a messy voting system. They rejected the path of a 
joint commitment to rebuild and reform Italian democracy, 
keeping the Right out, and they made the mistake of thinking 
that the country's vast moderate sector would rally to the 
forces proclaiming substantial continuity with the party that 
had dominated the first republic. But the issue that the poll 
now raises, and in no uncertain terms, is that of the quality of 
the transition and of the forces that can succeed in coalescing 
to lead it, including the forces of democratic Catholicism. 
  This election, the most difficult in our history, has buried 
the old Italy but has not given us a predefined future. This 
creates enormous problems on the domestic political front and 
raises major uncertainties for our international partners. 
Although it will be difficult, reconstruction cannot be 
avoided. From today onward, we all bear greater responsibility 
for our destiny.

  [Text] Portugal is, finally, going to integrate military

decision has been made; it remains to be seen what means will be 
used. Marines, the BMI [Mixed Independent Brigade], and a

  The Portuguese Armed Forces could soon integrate with some 
existing European forces within the Western European Union 
(WEU). At least this is the political intent of the Ministry of 
Defense and should be communicated shortly to our partners in 
that alliance. The indication of the specific units which 
Portugal intends to make available will be reserved for a later 
phase. 
  For now, three types of means are being considered: the 
marines, a warship (essentially a frigate), and the Mixed 
Independent Brigade (BMI). The marines would join the 
Anglo-Dutch amphibious brigade; the ship would be assigned to 
the nonpermanent air-sea force in the Mediterranean; and the BMI 
would join the land unit which Italy made available for the 
above-mentioned air-sea force. According to the same studies, 
the Air Force is the only branch that is not included in the 
Defense Ministry's international plans. 
<H5>  We Are Present </H5>
  Although our Armed Forces have not yet acquired the 
financial 
and operational capacity to join with these three European 
forces, the Portuguese Government wants to immediately establish 
a political position within the WEU. At this time, Portugal is 
one of the few countries, such as Luxembourg, which are not 
participating or have not yet manifested a political will to 
participate in these new international forces. Given this 
situation, Portugal has practically no influence on the 
destinies of the WEU. 
  Hence the strategy of the Defense Ministry is to state that 
it wishes to be present. The means by which it will do so will 
be discussed later. Incidentally, many other countries have 
followed the same strategy: First state a position and then 
negotiate calmly. According to a source in the Defense Ministry, 
"when one compares the political statements of the various 
European governments with what happens in practice, one is 
always surprised." There is the case, for example, of Spain, 
which announced some months ago, with pomp and circumstance, 
that it would send a brigade to the Eurocorps, but in practice 
has only made a battalion available. 
<H5>  Explanation </H5>
  Meanwhile, it might be asked if Portugal is interested in 
the 
establishment of a real European defense identity, since this is 
what is being created with the appearance of the aforementioned 
multinational forces. To better understand this question, let us 
see how this said European defense identity was actually born. 
  With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the consequent 
reunification of Germany, the weight of the new country in 
Europe became a source of concern for numerous commentators and 
also, privately, for many politicians. Would Germany now go its 
own way? This was the question everyone was asking. 
  Naturally, for historical reasons, the country most troubled 
by the new strategic situation was France. In a strategy of 
"flight to the front," Francois Mitterrand sought to find a way 
to bind Germany to its former allies. Within this strategy, the 
idea emerged to turn the Franco-German brigade into a real army 
corps of 35,000 to 40,000 men, "a large unit with a European 
vocation, which would aid in giving the European Union its own 
military capacity" and which would be open to other West 
European countries. And this came to pass at the La Rochelle 
summit, on 21 and 22 May 1992, which brought together Francois 
Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl. 
  The creation of this embryo of the future European army did 
not sit at all well with some partners in the Atlantic Alliance: 
the United States, England, and the Netherlands, all Atlantic 
countries. To these countries, said army corps constituted a 
threat to the preservation of trans-Atlantic ties, considering 
that France, the godfather of the idea, had always argued that, 
in matters of defense, Europe should be truly independent of the 
United States. 
<H5>  Between Nato and the WEU </H5>
  Under pressure from their partners, which included 
discussions between Washington and Bonn, France and Germany felt 
an obligation to offer an explanation. In their understanding, 
the Eurocorps was simply a way for Europe to publicly manifest 
its willingness to make a greater contribution to the security 
and defense of the Old Continent -- which the United States had 
long advocated. 
  However, the political explanation was not sufficient to put 
the Atlantic countries at ease. In December of the same year, 
during a NATO summit, the countries of the Eurocorps announced 
that the joint army would be under the operational tutelage of 
the Saceur [Supreme Allied Commander Europe] (NATO's European 
ground command) in the event of a crisis. This was sufficient to 
clear the air. 
  But the danger of the growing hegemony of the continental 
countries in matters of European defense was not yet completely 
allayed. Hence England and the Netherlands decided to place 
their amphibious brigade in the military structure of the WEU, 
in an attempt to downgrade the importance of the Eurocorps, 
which until then was the only adequately organized force. 
  From that moment on, other multinational forces began to be 
integrated within the WEU. This is the case of the multinational 
division formed by Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and 
France, and the air-sea force, comprising naval and air 
components from France, Italy, and Spain. 
<H5>  Portugal on Sidelines </H5>
  In all this, Portugal remained on the sidelines. In the 
first 
phase of the process, the position of Cavaco Silva's government 
was understandable. As an Atlantic country, Portugal should make 
every effort to see that, in matters of European defense, the 
transatlantic ties would not be broken. And, obviously, the 
isolated existence of the Eurocorps in the military structure of 
the WEU was contributing to bring that about. 
  But when other military entities with a strong Atlantic 
component began to appear within the WEU, it became necessary 
for Portugal to take a position, particularly considering that, 
at the last NATO summit meeting, the United States itself had 
encouraged the Europeans to create those forces. 
  Accordingly, Portugal has made a political decision: Our 
Armed Forces will join some of the already existing European 
forces. By what means, it remains to be seen. 
  And this is where the problems start to arise. Let us begin 
with the marines. 
  As O INDEPENDENTE learned, the Portuguese military have 
already had contacts with their British counterparts regarding 
the possible integration of our marines in the Anglo-Dutch 
amphibious brigade. Although there had been preliminary 
discussions, it soon appeared that the British were not too 
enthusiastic about the Portuguese offer. The reason is simple. 
Portugal has only men to offer. Our marines do not have landing 
craft, much less launching platforms, which means that the 
"fuzos" [marines] would have to hitch a ride with the British. 
  There is also a problem with regard to the naval craft for 
the Mediterranean air-sea force. According to our sources, the 
Navy does not have the financial capacity to maintain two 
frigates in operation in international fleets. It is noted that 
Portugal already makes a frigate available to the Stanavforlant 
[Standing Naval Force Atlantic] fleet. 
  The same can be said with regard to the BMI. Considering the 
Army budget in recent years, it is almost unbelievable that this 
branch has the financial capacity to permit its brigade to take 
part in exercises in Italy. 
  In other words, there are "small details" which could make 
it 
difficult to carry out the Defense Ministry politics -- for 
example, to seek to turn the Armed Forces into an instrument of 
the foreign policy of the state -- with the means which the 
government makes available to the military. Not to say that the 
emperor has no clothes.

<F P=106> [Article by Nuno Ribeiro in Madrid: "Assault on the </F>
Portuguese Border"] 
  [Text] It was with amazement that the Spanish 
Interior Ministry found its records out of date because of the 
presence of more illegal than legalized residents. With the 
alarm sounded, and owing to the surveillance, the first signs of 
an alternate itinerary, passing through Portugal, have been 
added to the traditional routes. According to international 
reports, this phenomenon will not stop, and it has forced the 
police to devote particular attention to the activity of the 
"triads." 
  In 1993, the Spanish authorities detected an increase in the 
illegal immigration of Chinese citizens, some having crossed the 
Portuguese border. From an almost insignificant phenomenon at 
the beginning of the decade, this flow has become a genuine 
"headache" for the Spanish police during recent years. 
  PUBLICO learned from the Madrid administration that over a 
fifth of the 336 Chinese whose entry into Spain was refused as 
of 30 September of last year had attempted the "leap." They came 
from Portugal, crossing the borders at Vilar Formoso/Fuentes de 
Onoro, in Salamanca, and the Caceres area, in Spanish 
Extremadura. The data for the first nine months of 1993 attest 
to the increase in this clandestine movement, which rose 208 
percent over the figure for the same period of 1992. 
  Although the Iberian Peninsula's borders are in the 
spotlight, with attempts at entry through Portugal tripling last 
year, the Spanish authorities appear more concerned over the 
movement from Eastern Europe, with obligatory passage through 
Barajas airport, in Madrid. In this instance, the number of 
native Chinese citizens denied entry rose fivefold; hence, the 
border issue is not considered too troublesome. One official 
assured PUBLICO: "The phenomenon concerns us, but the situation 
on the Portuguese border is not dramatic." 
  Moreover, the matter was not discussed at the 
Portuguese-Spanish summit during December, in Palma de Mallorca, 
at which the attention of the Internal Administration's 
ministers was focused on the battle against the drug traffic and 
the creation of mobile checkpoints. 
<H5>  "Stop-Offs" on New Route </H5>
  On the other hand, the Spanish administration stresses the 
good cooperation existing between the two nations' border 
services. It cited the speed with which clandestine Peruvian 
immigration rings were curbed in the past, as well as the 
increased control over natives of Brazil and of the former 
Portuguese colonies. 
  However, the possible presence of a network of Chinese on 
both sides of the border has evoked some dismay in Madrid. One 
official revealed: "We really don't know where the Chinese 
attempting to enter through Portugal are coming from; however, 
much of their documentation is false." 
  According to the known data, there have been two main routes 
thus far. The clandestine persons, most of whom are natives of 
Fujian and Zheijang Provinces (the poorest in China), traveled 
through the East, gathering in Germany. They departed, bound for 
various European destinations and for the other side of the 
Atlantic, in the United States and Canada. As an alternate 
itinerary, also detected now, the escape route is to Thailand 
and, later, to Western Europe, as the main destination. In many 
cases, upon their arrival in European territory they present a 
Japanese passport, since no visa is required to enter the 
European Union, and because of the similarity of the the 
Oriental physical features. 
  In view of the police harassment and surveillance on the 
borders, there is every indication that the routes have been 
diversified: something also admitted by the United States 
immigration services. The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in 
Madrid told PUBLICO that the Iberian Peninsula has been used as 
a launching pad for Chinese, whose path is later interrupted by 
the border services at John. F. Kennedy Airport in New York. 
Hence, according to that official, Porto and Madrid are the 
"stop-offs" on this new route. 
<H5>  The Power of the "Triads" </H5>
  This route, like others, could be abandoned as a result of 
the surveillance, although it is considered certain that the 
clandestine Chinese immigration will not decline. A report from 
the European Parliament published on 23 April 1992 even revealed 
that Hong Kong's integration with China in 1997 will foster a 
massive exodus. The Spanish administration does not conceal the 
lack of cooperation on the part of the Beijing authorities. 
  The Strasbourg report also notes that "triads" associated 
with this immigration movement have developed, and are 
exploiting labor that is attempting to find better living 
conditions. The report from the European Parliament members 
claims that Hong Kong and Taiwan are the present bases of the 
"Chinese mafia" which, faced with the imminent administrative 
change in the British colony, is seeking alternatives for its 
criminal businesses and activities. 
  In 1992, during the process of rectifying the status of 
foreigners in Spain, the Interior Ministry officials came across 
7,000 Chinese citizens who were not entered in their records. 
The first investigations led to the conclusion that the death of 
a member of the Chinese community was "compensated" by turning 
over the deceased person's documentation to another. This was 
the secret of a record longevity because, during the past five 
years, the deaths of only eight out of 5,000 legalized residents 
were reported. 
  The investigators also detected rings engaged in clandestine 
immigration, extortion (the payment of the so-called protection 
tax), illegal gambling, and, to a lesser extent, drug 
trafficking. According to the Spanish police general director, 
the "triads" (the existence of about 10 in Spain is admitted) 
have made a qualitative leap in their organization and 
entrenchment. Their offices are located in certain Chinese 
restaurants, the proliferation of which is shocking: In Spain, 
they changed from being a rarity to a supply exceeding 2,000. 
This has prompted the investigators to admit that, in some 
instances, they are expedients for money laundering. It is in 
these establishments that the illegals attempt, by working 14 
hours a day, to pay the 1,400 contos of the debt owed for the 
"leap." In addition to waiting on table, they work in small 
textile shops in the cellars, which also serve as their homes. 
  Engaged basically in immigration and the collection of the 
"protection tax" (which can amount to nearly 5,000 contos), the 
"triads" are connected with murders of Chinese merchants. Their 
first blow was the kidnapping of the son of an owner of a 
restaurant chain in Madrid, during August 1992. The most recent 
was the stabbing of a shop owner in the locality of Baix 
Llobregat, in Catalonia, on 31 December. A day earlier, in 
Gandia, Valencia, five Chinese working at the Ciudad del Mar 
restaurant were tortured and killed, with their bodies horribly 
mutilated.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "New Stimulus to Relations After Silence"] </F>
  [Text] The recent state of relations between Finland and 
Russia may be described as an expectant silence. Russia has 
curled up into itself with its own enormous problems. Like the 
rest of the world, in Finland we have stopped to look at how 
Russia's economic reforms are progressing and in which direction 
the power relations between the different factions are 
developing in that country. The talk about a special 
relationship between Finland and Russia has died down. 
  The world has changed so much that talk about a new period 
of 
transition in relations between Finland and Russia sounds like a 
hackneyed phrase. However, with the end of Mauno Koivisto's term 
in office, the time when the special relationship between 
Finland and Russia was founded on the maintenance of high-level 
personal contacts is apparently finally at an end. 
  It is unlikely that Martti Ahtisaari can continue to operate 
on the same basis. The world has changed, Russia has changed, 
and the relationship between Russia and Finland has changed too. 
There is no reason to yearn for the old days. We have to quickly 
learn to live in keeping with the new circumstances without 
losing any opportunities to make use of those advantages and 
assets that we may have had for a long time in the past. 
  Getting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to visit Finland 
had been put off for a regrettably long time. The damage has now 
been repaired. Today, Chernomyrdin is more and more clearly 
Russia's day-to-day strong man. We must, however, take care not 
to lapse into the old pattern of thinking that Chernomyrdin 
could become the key man in economic relations between Finland 
and Russia. We must in the future be able to develop relations, 
above all, directly with business firms. 
  The slowdown in Russia's market economy reforms does not 
change this basic fact in any way, let alone Chernomyrdin's 
promise to revive the former Economic Commission. The Economic 
Commission may be of help in dealing with various financial 
arrangements, guarantees, and countersecurities. But under the 
new circumstances the commission will no longer be the 
cooperation engine and problem resolver of the good old days. 
  The agreement between Neste [state oil company] and Gazprom 
[gas industry], the world's biggest producer of natural gas, on 
setting up a joint company is one model indicative of the 
direction in which development should be oriented. The Russian 
company is paying for its share in hard currency, markkas. At 
the present time natural gas is probably one of the riskiest 
fields for joint ventures. Hopefully, through it we will gain 
momentum for Finland, too, in the important plans for a West 
European natural gas network and for linking up both networks. 
The Imatra Power Company's general agreement on overhauling 
Russia's power plants is also a valuable new field. 
  Chernomyrdin's official visit as prime minister was devoted 
solely to economic issues. President Martti Ahtisaari still 
played a secondary role. Political relations and talk of a 
special relationship between Finland and Russia may acquire new 
significance if Finland becomes a member of the European Union. 
In that case Russia will gain through Finland both a political 
and an economic EU neighbor on its border.

  [Text] According to Foreign Minister Heikko Haavisto, 
increased European cooperation requires that Russia too, should 
be ready to become engaged in partnerships based on equality. 
He described isolationist trends, which in his view are 
apparent in Russia, as the greatest danger to the relationship 
between a reformist Russia and West Europe. 
  The Finnish foreign minister noted that the West has been 
concerned with Russian statements echoing the old philosophy of 
spheres of influence and said that Russia must comply with 
international norms and codes of behavior in defending its 
interests. 
  Minister Haavisto spoke at a defense policy seminar in 
Helsinki.

  [Excerpt] The Finnish Foreign Ministry has revised its 
calculations of the cost to Finland of joining the European 
Union [EU]. In contrast to earlier estimates, the Foreign 
Ministry now says that Finland will become a net contributor to 
the EU budget in the first year as a member. The revised 
calculations are 1 billion markkas [FMk] less favorable to 
Finland than those put forward a month ago. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified correspondent] Finland's top 
EU negotiators on 29 March presented new figures on the cost of 
membership in the European Union. According to the latest 
calculations, Finland's dues to the EU will be FMk6.8 billion or 
over 1 billion dollars. If this is accurate, then Finland 
stands to become a net contributor of some FMk350 million to the 
European budget in 1995. Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki 
Haavisto suggests that Finland's net membership cost could rise 
to FMk2 to 3 billion in the future. 
  The latest figures come just a month after the completion of 
the accession talks. Earlier calculations portrayed Finland as 
a net beneficiary of some FMk700 million next year. The 
discrepancy between this and the new calculations is in the 
range of FMk1 billion. The gap has been explained by the fact 
that Finland, and evidently other applicant countries as well, 
have counted certain EU support moneys twice in calculating the 
cost of membership. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Markku Hurmeranta report: "Growing Support for the EU"] </F>
  [Text] There are is some disparity between the survey 
results on Finnish support for the EU currently in circulation. 
An unpublished poll carried out by Taloustutkimus Oy indicates 
that support for the EU has now risen to 48 percent, while 
another poll carried out by Suomen Gallup for HELSINGIN SANOMAT 
puts support at 42 percent. The survey carried out by 
Taloustutkimus was ready 16 March, while the survey carried out 
on behalf of HELSINGIN SANOMAT was published Tuesday, 22 March. 
  The Taloustutkimus poll, primarily intended for use by 
organizations, puts opposition to the EU at 26 percent. An 
equal proportion of respondents was undecided about their 
attitude. The Suomen Gallup survey showed 27 percent against 
and 30 percent undecided. The results indicating 48 percent in 
favor of the EU are part of a weekly follow-up study monitored 
by various organizations and the Foreign Ministry. Known as the 
Tele-Bus survey, it interviews 500 people between ages 15 and 
74. Suomen Gallup uses a sample of 1,000 people. Both polling 
institutes now use the same questionnaire format, which is 
intended for use in the forthcoming referendum. 
  The results of Taloustutkimus' published and unpublished 
polls have throughout shown a slightly higher number in favor of 
the EU than have Suomen Gallup's. "This is very hard to 
explain, especially after the harmonization of the 
questionnaires," Hanju Ilkas, research chief with the 
Taloustutkimus Institute, said. According to Ilkas, the only 
possible explanation is that people are simply influenced by the 
institute asking the questions.

in September"] 
  [Excerpt] The National Coalition Party is expecting that 
the date of the Finnish referendum on EU [European Union] 
membership will be decided without delay. The decision should 
be an independent one, entirely independent of how Sweden and 
Norway act. 
  The official resolution from the joint meeting of the party 
executive committee, the party board, and the party's Eduskunta 
group did not specify a date, but judging from party chairman 
Pertti Salolainen's remarks, sights have been set on September. 
  "If the present European Parliament succeeds in scrutinizing 
the agreement this spring, September would be a very suitable 
date for the referendum," he said, adding that the National 
Coalition Party cannot accept any "clever party political 
tactical maneuvering" on this issue. Nor should there be any 
unnecessary delays or anything else that could jeopardize the 
decision on EU membership at home. 
  The possibility of simultaneous referendums on EU membership 
in the three Nordic applicant countries -- something to which 
Prime Minister Esko Aho seems to have given thought -- was not 
mentioned during the discussion, either by Salolainen or anyone 
else. 
  The pressure for a rapid and emphatic yes to the EU is very 
strong in the National Coalition Party. The whole matter was 
even described as "the National Coalition Party's project."

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Romantschuck: "Left Alliance and Communist </F>
Unity Party Separate: `An Important Day for Finnish Left'"] 
  [Excerpt] The Left Alliance [VL] and Unity Communists 
[SKP-Y] have jointly decided that activity for these two will 
continue as two separate parties. 
  "We are not going to involve ourselves in each others' 
internal affairs," said VL general secretary Matti Viialainen 
after the decision was reached yesterday. "This is an important 
day for the Finnish left." 
  SKP-Y Chairman Yrjo Hakanen thought that the two parties 
actually "didn't apply for a divorce," but rather are 
strengthening their cooperation in the fight against mass 
unemployment and for maintaining the welfare society. 
  Yesterday's decision means that leadership of the SKP-Y quit 
the VL. The 14 district organizations of the SKP-Y are to later 
also leave the VF. 
  The 19-person parliament delegation will continue its 
activity as before, despite the fact that within it there are 
some who are regarded as close to the SKP-Y. These four are 
Marjatta Stenius-Kaukonen, Ensio Laine, Esko-Juhani Tennila, and 
Jaakko Laakso. SKP-Y Chairman Hakanen said he does not consider 
any MP as "his own." 
  How the two parties will continue cooperation -- which now 
is 
to be normalized -- is still not clear. No decision on campaign 
cooperation in the parliamentary elections has yet been reached. 
SKP-Y, which in continuing the activity of the [former] SKP, 
does not intend to enter the election with its own lists. VL 
again expects to have also nonmembers on its candidate lists. 
<H5>  Double Membership Restricted </H5>
  Viialainen has worked to get SKP-Y members and district 
organizations excluded from the VL ever since the foundation of 
VL four years ago. To achieve the goal, the Alliance's party 
rules are to be amended to allow prohibiting double membership. 
Now this amending will not be needed, since the agreement 
satisfactorily resolves this issue. Paragraph 7 [of the 
agreement] was written so that a member participating in acts 
harming the party can be expelled. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Rolf L. Larsen report: "Iran's Response -- Expels </F>
Norwegian Consul"] 
  [Text] Two days after Norway expelled Iranian Consul 
Mohammad Movahed, Iran has retaliated by expelling Arne Lundby, 
Norway's consul in Tehran. 
  "Norwegian Ambassador Birger Bye was yesterday summoned to 
the Foreign Ministry in Tehran and was told that Consul Arne 
Lundby, the second in command at the Norwegian Embassy, must 
leave the country before 4 April," acting Foreign Ministry press 
spokesman Arthur Baste Knudsen said. 
  The Foreign Ministry is as yet undecided whether and how to 
respond to the expulsion from Iran. After the expulsion, the 
Iranian Embassy in Oslo has five employees with diplomatic 
accreditation, while Norway has two employees with the same 
status after the expulsion of Lundby. 
  Lundby has been on vacation in Norway and was expected back 
in Tehran in the early hours of Monday morning [28 March]. 
Birger Bye, Norway's ambassador in Tehran, was not available by 
telephone on Sunday. 
  "We gave a clear reason for our expulsion and do not think 
that this reaction from Iran is fitting," Baste Knudsen said. 
The Foreign Ministry's official reason for the expulsion was 
that the Iranian consul engaged in activities that were 
incompatible with his diplomatic status. A high-ranking source 
in the Foreign Ministry told DAGBLADET on Saturday that Movahed 
had been spying on his fellow countrymen in Norway. Baste 
Knudsen was unwilling to confirm this. Four Iranian diplomats 
have been expelled from Sweden for the same reason. 
  According to the NRK/Dagsrevyen program, Iranian radio 
announced on Sunday that the Norwegian consul had been expelled 
because he had engaged in activities incompatible with his 
diplomatic status. According to the Foreign Ministry, no 
official explanation has been given for the expulsion of Consul 
Lundby. The Foreign Ministry therefore considers that the 
expulsion is a retaliation. 
  Consul Lundby has worked in Iran since last fall. He has 
also served as embassy secretary in Canada.

<F P=106> [Ole Magnus Rapp report: "Russian-Norwegian Railway Being </F>
Considered"] 
  [Text] Tromso -- A railroad between Murmansk and Kirkenes 
will be discussed when Russia's and Norway's foreign ministers 
meet today. 
  A railroad is now high on the list of wants of Norwegian and 
Russian industry and commerce. From the terminus in Nikel it is 
only a few kilometers to Kirkenes. Industry and commerce also 
want there to be more that is concrete to emerge from all the 
fine-sounding solemn speeches. There has been a good increase 
in trading cooperation since the establishment of the Barents 
Sea region. 
  "We fully agree that the time for talking is now over. Now 
the concrete results are starting to come," said Knut Eirik 
Olsen, head of information at the Barents Sea Region Secretariat. 
  The cooperation between the various regions involved takes 
place on several levels, from ministerial to shopkeeper level. 
In 1993, 134 million kroner of the Foreign Ministry's East 
European package totaling 416 million kroner was used to 
stimulate cooperation between Norway and northwestern Russia. 
The largest part of this money went to industrial cooperation, 
infrastructure projects, and environmental protection. The 
Foreign Ministry is intent on continuing major economic 
investment in regional cooperation. 
  Kvaerner Kimek A/S, a ship repair company in Kirkenes, was 
an 
early player in the field and is among those companies that have 
made the most progress. Russian ships want Western maintenance 
and at present the company is investing 300 million kroner in a 
new covered shipyard installation. The company now has plans 
for a shipyard in Murmansk for breaking up ships and military 
installations. 
  The Telecommunications Authority has also paved the way for 
3,500 Norwegian telephone lines to both Murmansk and Arkhangelsk 
provinces. Russian companies, which want closer contacts with 
the West are now acquiring such links. 
  The Russian banking system is unable to keep up with 
developments. A money transfer between East and West can take 
months, and this creates major problems for industrial 
cooperation. Den norske Bank and Sparebanken Nord-Norge are 
helping their Russian colleagues with the introduction of 
Western banking systems. 
  Norwegian entrepreneurs see a possible market on the Kola 
Peninsula and have received project support from the Foreign 
Ministry. Possibilities are also seen by Agricultural 
Cooperation in Northern Norway, the National Association of 
Norwegian Reindeer-Farming Lapps, the Sea Research Institute, 
the State Data Processing Center, Tromso University, and many 
others. 
  So far, cooperation in the field of fisheries has had the 
greatest volume. Half the fish landed in Finnmark in 1993 was 
delivered by Russian vessels. A number of fish industry 
companies in Tromso and Finnmark are currently becoming 
dependent on Russian raw materials, at the same time as Russian 
fishing boat operators are dependent on access to Western 
currency. 
  "Everything is changing very quickly, and industrial leaders 
in Russia have had to adapt themselves in a relatively short 
period of time from communist rule to market forces," consultant 
Roald Johansen of Business Competence in Hammerfest said. The 
organization helps Norwegian industry to find cooperation 
partners in the East, and to avoid the worst traps: "The 
Russians think that the Norwegians are not concrete enough. 
They want quick decisions and as few solemn speeches as 
possible."

<F P=106> [Heidi Borud report: "`No to the EU' Front Coordinates </F>
Activities"] 
  [Text] The no to the EU front is coordinating its 
activities. This means closer cooperation between Social 
Democrats Against the EU (SME) and No to the EU. 
  Both SME leader Hallvard Bakke and No to the EU leader 
Kristen Nygaard have told AFTENPOSTEN that cooperation on the no 
side is now to be strengthened. 
  "All the groups on the no side now feel that much closer 
cooperation is necessary. No to the EU will be the coordinating 
body, but this will not lead to any central control," Nygaard 
told AFTENPOSTEN. 
  He said that the time is not yet ripe for weekly meetings, 
but that those active on the no side will meet as and when 
necessary. 
  "This means closer cooperation and ongoing consultations." 
  Labor Party faction Social Democrats Against the EU, the 
Center Party, the Christian People's Party, the Liberal Party, 
Red Electoral Alliance, and the Workers' Communist Party are all 
involved in this cooperation, as are the Norwegian Farmers 
Association, the Association of Farmers and Smallholders, and 
several youth and environmental organizations. There are also 
good contacts with the Norwegian Fishermen's Association that 
has its secretariat in Trondheim. 
  In what ways will you be active in the run-up to the Labor 
Party national congress? 
  "I expect that it will be SME that will tackle this area 
first and foremost. The national congress will probably do what 
the head of government wants -- which is, to increase the 
chances of Norway joining the EU," Kristen Nygaard said. 
  SME will hold its first national conference in the 
Folketeater building in Oslo on 9 and 10 April. This will be 
the formal founding of the no organization within the Labor 
Party. Hallvard Bakke expects that all the country's provinces 
will send representatives, and he is standing formally as the 
organization's leader. 
  Bakke too stresses that it is important to have broad 
cooperation on the no side. 
  "We are working to become as united as possible," he said. 
  Bakke rejected the suggestion that the SME is working to 
recruit the no people for the Labor Party's national congress. 
  "We are not a faction within the Labor Party. We are working 
in relation to the referendum. I expect that there will be a 
clear yes majority at the national congress, but the national 
congress will not decide anything at all. That is what the 
referendum will do," Bakke said. 
  Asked how many members SME now has, Bakke replied that he 
does not know. Nor does he know how many of the Labor Party's 
Storting deputies are members of SME. 
  The battle for Norwegian minds on the subject of the EU is 
largely an internal battle within the Labor Party. Storting 
deputy Olav Akselsen was one of the 15 Labor Party deputies who 
voted against submitting an EU membership application in the 
last Storting. 
  Now he is increasingly doubtful, and membership of SME has 
never been a consideration for him: 
  "It is a militant organization for those who are unshakable 
in their faith," Akselsen said. 
  He views the EU issue as a "question of faith." 
  "It is a question of what you believe is best for 
Norway," he said. 
  Labor Party Youth Association [AUF] leader Trond Giske is a 
member of the interim executive of the SME. He will play an 
active role on the no side in the run-up to the referendum. Of 
the internal conflict in the AUF he said: "There was a clear 
majority at the national conference that opposed the EU." 
  Giske also made it clear that the AUF will cooperate with 
other no organizations and fight its campaign in part through 
the SME. 
  Storting deputy Anneliese Dorum from Akershus is also a 
member of the interim board of the SME. She is concerned that 
"in the name of democracy" there must be a reasonable split 
between yes and no delegates to the Labor Party national 
congress. 
  "It will be up to us as individuals and party members to see 
to it that both supporters and opponents are represented at the 
national congress," Dorum said. 
  Akershus will elect its national congress delegates at its 
annual general meeting on 23 April.

<F P=106> [Mikael Holmstrom report: "NATO Cooperation Urgent"] </F>
  [Text] The government expects Sweden to join NATO's new 
form of cooperation, Partnership for Peace (PFP), within a 
month. Yesterday the government submitted a document to the 
Riksdag that will make it possible for Sweden to join soon. The 
first exercises could be held this fall. 
  "It is important to initiate Swedish involvement in PFP as 
soon as possible," the government writes. 
  Swedish involvement in PFP will take place "on the 
foundation 
of military nonalignment. This cooperation represents no 
defense commitments." It is part of the attempts to construct a 
new pan-European defense order. 
  On 10 January the NATO nations invited the rest of Europe to 
join Partnership and as early as 13 January the Foreign Affairs 
Council was already agreed that Sweden should join. Initially 
the government wanted to say yes to the invitation immediately. 
  But the Social Democrats in particular wanted to give time 
for the Riksdag Foreign Affairs Committee to deal with motions 
shelved on the subject of PFP. The committee has reached an 
agreement in principle, but last week the Social Democrats, the 
Left Party, and New Democracy surprisingly called for a separate 
document that the government delivered yesterday after a 
lightning action. It means that new motions can be submitted up 
to 12 April. 
  All countries around the Baltic Sea are participating in PFP 
or have said that they will do so. 
  The first step is to sign the framework document that the 
NATO summit set out. Today 13 countries have done so. The 
government will sign as soon as the Riksdag has completed its 
consideration of the matter in a month, government sources have 
told SVENSKA DAGBLADET. The document is primarily intended for 
the countries of East Europe and does not represent any 
complications for Sweden. 
  It is true that the participating countries are promised the 
right to consultations with NATO if their security is 
threatened. But an unofficial Swedish interpretation is that 
this is chiefly a "reassuring teddy bear for the countries of 
the East" (that want to but as yet are not allowed to become 
NATO members). Officially the government is saying: "No state 
can be included unless it wants to be involved. Sweden's 
freedom of action is not therefore restricted by this offer." 
  In saying this the government ignores the fact that Sweden 
is 
acquiring yet another diplomatic card to play in a serious 
crisis in our immediate environs if the United Nations and the 
CSCE fail in their missions. 
  In only a month Sweden could therefore take the step of 
entering this cooperation. There is a so-called document of 
introduction, with a list of Swedish offers to NATO. This 
document is effectively already complete, SVENSKA DAGBLADET's 
source has said. 
  Sweden is offering courses for other states on how to carry 
out peacekeeping actions and humanitarian operations. 
  In addition Sweden is prepared to support the peacekeeping 
force that the three Baltic states want to set up for operations 
in other countries. Finally Sweden is offering to promote 
democratic control and openness in military structures in East 
and Central Europe. 
  The third step along the road to PFP is consultations 
between 
NATO and the states involved about what in concrete terms should 
be done. Here increased Swedish military contacts with the NATO 
headquarters in Brussels and NATO military headquarters in Mons, 
also in Belgium, will be needed. The government stresses how 
important it is for Sweden to be involved at an early stage in 
order to be able to influence the discussions that have already 
begun at diplomatic and military level. 
  A fourth stage is that a fixed-term agreement between NATO 
and each PFP country is concluded about what is to be done. 
  Sweden is already prepared to take part this fall with at 
most a company (this will require a change in the law that the 
government will propose later this year) in the first exercise 
abroad involving peacekeeping forces. 
  The cost through to the spring of 1995 is estimated at 26 
million kronor and will be met from the Foreign Ministry's 
budget.

<F P=106> [Hans O. Alfredsson report: "Center Leaning Toward Yes to </F>
EU"] 
  [Text] The Center Party will probably say yes to Swedish 
membership in the EU [European Union]. This is now the view of 
[party leader] Olof Johansson. Johansson himself will wait a 
month before finally making up his mind. 
  There was a lot of talk about "the democratic process," 
"dialogue," "not laying down the law," and "not lecturing 
people" when the Center Party leadership gave a news conference 
in Stockholm yesterday. The news conference took place in 
connection with a whole day's meeting of representatives of all 
the party's districts meeting as the party's board of 
representatives. 
  Andreas Carlgren, the party's second deputy chairman, a warm 
EU supporter, summarized his impressions of discussions by 
saying that there is every indication that the party executive 
will recommend the extraordinary congress on the EU to decide in 
favor of membership. Olof Johansson backed him up by saying 
that that was his impression too. 
  "Things are leaning in that direction, yes," he said in 
reply 
to a question. 
  In the same breath he reiterated that the party's internal 
processes must be allowed to take their course. Most 
immediately this involves holding 24 regional conferences. 
After that the party executive will review the situation and 
put forward a recommendation for the EU congress. It is likely 
that at that time too Olof Johansson will confess to his faith 
in the EU in public. 
  The questions about why he cannot do so now became so 
numerous that Andreas Carlgren felt the need to intervene a 
couple of times and explain and defend his party leader's 
position. 
  "Olof's approach is necessary so that the Center Party can 
complete the democratic process," he said. 
  The party's foreign affairs spokesman, Par Granstedt -- 
another warm advocate of the EU -- was irritated that 
journalists are so interested in the absence of any decision 
hitherto on the EU question on the part of the Center Party 
leader. This is "something of a democratic problem," he 
claimed, since it is merely a matter of a few weeks one way or 
another. 
  "This sabotages a serious debate and I think that this is 
mildly serious." 
  Granstedt himself put a 28-page report, "Green Future for 
Europe," before the board of representatives. This can, if 
largely by implication, be read as a long plea for membership. 
  Par Granstedt claims that the Center Party's conditions for 
a 
yes have been met in the agreement that has been negotiated. 
  This means, he said, that Sweden cannot be forced to abandon 
its nonalignment, forced into cooperation in the defense field, 
or be forced to have the same currency as other EU states. 
These conditions have been strongly emphasized by the three 
most recent Center Party congresses.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by leading opponents of EU membership: </F>
"Why the European Union (EU) Agreement Is a Failure"] 
  [Text] Nothing has been achieved in the European 
Union (EU) negotiations that can make an EU skeptic more 
positive about membership. From the beginning Sweden has 
accepted all the EU's fundamental rules. Therefore Sweden 
neither requested guarantees for our freedom from alliances nor 
asked for an exemption from the EU's plans for a common 
currency. In addition the Swedish public access principle has 
been dropped and our restrictive alcohol policy has been 
abandoned. That is what 13 opinion formers and debaters from the 
chairman of the Left Party to moderate economics Professor Johan 
Lybeck write in a joint article. 
  The whole point of departure for the Swedish membership 
negotiations has been Sweden's acceptance of all the EU's 
fundamental rules. Almost all the "exemptions" that are now 
being presented are simply transition rules of various kinds. 
The most important parts of EU law, such as the Maastricht 
treaty, have not been seriously mentioned in the negotiations; 
Sweden has not requested any special rules there. 
  The Swedish negotiators have not requested or received any 
guarantees concerning our freedom from alliances. On the 
contrary, our negotiators have clearly emphasized that our 
freedom from alliances is not permanent and that we view the 
EU's development toward a joint defense policy positively. And 
things have gone farther than that. There are plans to merge the 
military alliance, the Western European Union (WEU), with the EU 
in 1996. Then we will have an EU defense system in practice. At 
that time our formal freedom from alliances will be eliminated. 
  Neutrality policy is already precluded if a country joins 
under the current rules. Ulf Dinkelspiel made this clear in his 
opening address when the negotiations began: "At the same time 
we realize that the long-term formulation of a joint defense 
policy that could lead in time to a joint defense system is a 
goal for the common foreign and security policy that will be 
discussed further within the framework of the 1996 review 
conference. We do not intend to hinder the European Union's 
progress toward this goal." It could hardly be expressed more 
clearly; Sweden has in practice already waived the formal veto 
right we should have had at the summit meeting in 1996 when a 
joint defense will be established. 
  If we join the union, Sweden is already totally committed to 
pursuing the EU's foreign and security policy and refraining 
from any action that is contrary to the interests of the union. 
Sweden has also approved the special declaration found in the 
treaty under which member countries waive their formal veto 
rights on foreign policy matters. 
  Sweden has not asked for any exemptions from the EU's 
much-discussed and criticized plans for a joint economic policy 
and a common currency, the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). 
This means that Sweden is legally committed to all the steps in 
the creation of the monetary union. This also means that Sweden 
has no possibility of rejecting the last step of the EMU in 
which our national monetary unit, the krona, will be eliminated 
in favor of a common currency and a common central bank. Broadly 
speaking the monetary union will preclude a national economic 
policy and put us entirely at the mercy of the policies the 
union dictates in the economic area. 
  By means of borrowing requirements the union will control 
the 
size of our national budget, our interest rates and our exchange 
rate. This policy, which is secured by treaty and gives low 
inflation a higher priority than fighting unemployment, is 
currently driving up unemployment to dangerous levels in the 
entire EU. The direction of the policy will be guided by the 
treaty and later also by the politically independent central 
bank and thus cannot be changed via democratic decisions. 
  Sweden has committed itself to a strict austerity policy and 
a return to a fixed exchange rate in relation to the European 
Currency Unit (ECU) as a step toward a common currency. At a 
time of internalization and changes in the economy, we are 
giving up the possibility of adapting our economy and our 
conditions to the national and international situation. This 
could be devastating for the Swedish economy and for employment. 
  The Swedish negotiators have not requested and thus have not 
obtained any legally binding safeguard for the Swedish principle 
of free access to public records. To the extent the issue has 
been mentioned in the negotiations it has had the nature of 
unilateral Swedish declarations that totally lack legal value in 
future conflicts with EU law. The principle of public access is 
threatened from several sides. A proposed new EU directive on 
access to computer files also involves a direct restriction of 
the public access principle. 
  The so-called breakthrough in the negotiations came on 21 
December of last year. But aside from the snuff provision, the 
agreement does not contain any permanent exemptions where Sweden 
is concerned. The media portrayed the whole thing as a big 
success, but if one looks more closely at the substance, the 
package from the EU was mainly empty. 
  Several important environmental issues were decided in the 
"package." The most important result is that Sweden has accepted 
a reform moratorium under which we cannot freely increase our 
environmental requirements on products. In addition Sweden has 
been forced to make changes that are actually for the worse in 
automobile emission requirements. Sweden has a four-year 
transition period in several important areas -- cadmium, tin 
organic compounds, arsenic, PCP, batteries, and the labeling and 
classification of chemicals. Sweden wanted a guarantee that 
would make it quite clear that the requirements will not have to 
be lowered in the future; no such guarantee was given. 
  In some areas it was noted that Swedish rules are not in 
conflict with the EU's present rules, this applies to mercury, 
asbestos and chlorine organic solutions. This means that we can 
keep the rules today but that they may very well end up in 
conflict with EU law in the future if the EU adopts new rules in 
these areas or as a result of the so-called Cassis de Dijon 
principle. 
  Sweden has not obtained solid guarantees for a restrictive 
alcohol policy. On the contrary, several of the foundation 
blocks have already been abandoned. Sweden has obtained a 
two-year transition rule for the quantity of alcohol that can be 
brought into the country. But it is clear that border checks 
within the EU will be phased out in a few more years, which will 
make a functioning supervision of imports impossible. This means 
that alcohol prices will have to be cut drastically in the long 
run. All alcohol monopolies except the sales monopoly have been 
abandoned. And there is no guarantee that the state company for 
the sale of wine and spirits can continue to have a monopoly on 
sales. 
  The removal of border checks will probably also lead to an 
increased influx of drugs into Sweden. 
  Another kind letter from an EU commissioner is said to be a 
safeguard for Swedish collective contracts. But the letter has 
no legal status that implies such a guarantee. It is impossible 
to rule out future conflicts in which, for example, foreign 
contractors can claim that they are not compelled to respect 
agreements in Swedish collective contracts. 
  Sweden has committed itself to full participation in the 
union's common trade policy. This mean increased tariffs and 
more quotas for Sweden's trade with the rest of the world. There 
is a risk that several product groups will be made more 
expensive for Swedish consumers, especially in the clothing area. 
  Nor can the issues that were "resolved" in the final phase 
of 
the negotiations be said to represent a Swedish success. That 
Sweden will take part in the EU's regional policy subsidies is a 
matter of course; all EU countries receive subsidies from the EU 
funds. What is more surprising is how little Sweden will get. 
The thousand kronor per person that goal-6 subsidies should 
involve for inland Norrland has turned out to be considerably 
less. 
  Even if all the subsidies from the EU's various regional 
funds are included, the inhabitants of sparely populated areas 
of Sweden will get back less than the approximately 2,000 kronor 
that every Swede will have to contribute to the EU budget. The 
Swedish negotiators had demanded subsidies from the most 
advantageous fund, goal 1, but this was denied. This could be 
important, especially with regard to how long goal 6 support 
will remain in existence, it will be renegotiated in 1999. 
  As expected, Sweden will immediately adopt the EU's 
agricultural policy. This means that Swedish agricultural policy 
will be bureaucratized and regulated in detail. 
  Sweden will be allowed to phase in the membership fee for 
several years. Over a somewhat longer time period this phasing 
in lacks any great importance. Actually the membership fee will 
become increasingly expensive in the future; it is estimated 
that it will amount to 25 billion kronor a year in 1999. 
  Now we know what terms will apply if Sweden joins the union. 
No decisive exemptions or guarantees have been given that could 
inspire a more positive response in anyone who was skeptical 
about union membership. For opponents the negotiating results 
mean that we will now step up the pressure in our efforts 
against Swedish membership in the union. 
  We are united in our defense of Swedish democracy, national 
autonomy, and worldwide international cooperation as the 
alternative to union membership.

<F P=106> [Monica Bjorklund report: "Left Party Climbs Above </F>
Threshold"] 
  [Text] New Democracy continues to lose voter support and 
has now fallen below the threshold for representation in the 
Riksdag. The Left Party on the other hand has taken a sizeable 
step up, the SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo [Swedish Institute for 
Opinion Research] opinion poll for March shows. 
  For the other Riksdag parties the changes are smaller. The 
Moderate Coalition Party and the Center Party have continued the 
gains of the past few months. The Liberal Party has also moved 
forward, while the Social Democrats and the Christian Democratic 
Party are losing voters. 
  New Democracy has lost 0.9 percentage points since last 
month. With 3.3 percent of votes the party is now quite a way 
below the 4-percent threshold for representation in the Riksdag. 
  "It is the tumult in the party and the uncertainty about 
where the party is heading that are having an effect," said Alf 
Sjostrom, head of Sifo opinion polls. 
  "From the very start it was clear that New Democracy was two 
parties really, an Ian party and a Bert party [reference to 
party's two founders], where Ian Wachtmeister attracted Moderate 
voters and Bert Karlsson hesitant Social Democrats. 
  ``It is now uncertain whether New Democracy will become a 
Bert party or a former Ian party or no party at all. Many 
voters are therefore returning to their old parties.'' 
  During the polling period New Democracy has lost as many 
votes to the Social Democrats as to the Moderates. 
  The second large and statistically reliable change in 
voters' 
intentions is the rise of 1.1 percent for the Left Party. The 
party more than regained its losses from last month and is now 
some way over the 4 percent threshold. 
  Many of the new sympathizers are former "stay-at-homes." The 
party has also attracted some Social Democrats, perhaps those 
dissatisfied with the party's position on the question of 
unemployment insurance. Some new Left Party votes also come 
from the nonsocialist bloc -- something that could indicate that 
the EU question has begun to play a role. Perhaps some 
nonsocialist opponents of the EU are singalling their 
dissatisfaction by supporting the Left Party. 
  The overall SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo poll for March is as 
follows, with changes from the previous months in parentheses: 
  Social Democrats 48.3 (minus 0.7) 
  Left Party 4.3 (plus 1.1) 
  Moderate Coalition Party 21.4 (plus 0.4) 
  Center Party 7.7 (plus 0.1) 
  Liberal Party 6.7 (plus 0.5) 
  Christian Democratic Party 4.3 (minus 0.3) 
  Green Ecology Party 3.0 (plus 0.1) 
  New Democracy 3.3 (minus 0.9) 
  Others 1.0 (minus 0.3) 
  Some 11.1 percent of those interviewed either abstained or 
were unwilling to name any party. 
  A total of 3,732 people were interviewed in the period 28 
February to 24 March. They were asked the question: "Which 
party would you vote for in a Riksdag election if there were an 
election today?" 
  Four parties are currently balancing around the 4-percent 
threshold. The Christian Democratic Party and the Left Party 
each with 4.3 percent, New Democracy with 3.3 percent, and the 
Green Ecology Party with 3.0 percent. 
  The Moderates and the Center Party have continued their 
gains 
of the past few months. Since December the Moderates have 
increased by 1.1 percent and the Center Party by 1.3 percent. 
  The Liberal Party makes gains in the March poll, but is 
still 
below the 7.5 percent the party had in December. 
  The Christian Democratic Party continues to move up and 
down, 
but is remaining around the 4 percent mark. 
  The Social Democrats lost ground for the second month in a 
row and this month lost 0.7 percentage points. 
  In the previous poll in February there was clear support for 
a new women's party. Of the 1.3 percent of voters who were 
willing to vote for a party other than the established parties, 
more than half made spontaneous mention of the women's 
party/women's list. 
  Now this support has decreased. Fewer people are ready to 
vote for another party and fewer people mentioned the women's 
party/women's list. 
  "There is therefore not the same tendency as when the Green 
Ecology Party or New Democracy came into being," Alf Sjostrom 
said. In these two cases support increased noticeably month by 
month. 
  The reduced support could in part be a result of the fact 
that recently there has not been as much attention paid to 
writer Maria-Pia Boethius and her possible plans to form a new 
women's party. 
  "If you are going to form a party, you really need to be 
outwardly active and work for the party's ideas," Alf Sjostrom 
said.

Government will not proceed with any action before the UN 
secretary general submits his report to the Security Council. 
Kliridhis added that he does not expect anything from his 
meeting tomorrow with Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department 
special coordinator on the Cyprus issue. 
  The president said there is nothing new to justify the 
convening of a National Council meeting. He added: When there 
is, I will convene it. Asked whether he will stop over in 
Athens upon his return from Strasbourg where he will address the 
Council of Europe parliamentary assembly, Kliridhis said this 
will depend on his schedule.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis told Robert Lamb, the 
U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus, that he is 
seriously concerned about the prospects for a Cyprus solution 
because of the Turkish Cypriot side's continuing intransigence. 
  Following the Kliridhis-Lamb meeting in the Presidential 
Palace this morning, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis 
said that the U.S. coordinator submitted no proposals or ideas 
regarding the proximity talks on the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's]. Kasoulidhis added that Lamb asked to hear the 
Greek Cypriot side's evaluation regarding the impasse resulting 
from the talks. 
  Lamb described his meeting with President Kliridhis as very 
constructive. He said enough progress was made but refrained 
from identifying the topics on which there are differences. The 
U.S. coordinator will meet [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas 
in the occupied areas at noon. At 1700, Lamb will have another 
meeting with President Kliridhis.

  [Text] Atay Ahmet Rasid, minister of foreign affairs and 
defense, has said that the Greek Cypriot side must quickly 
abandon its inflexible approach and refrain from making 
statements and accusations against the Turkish Cypriot side that 
are aimed at misleading the public, so that a balanced and just 
result can be achieved from the talks that are being held on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  In a written statement yesterday, Rasid recalled Greek 
Cypriot Foreign Minister Alexandros Mikhailidhis' effort to 
blame the Turkish Cypriot side for the deadlock in the talks on 
the confidence-building measures and said that Mikhailidhis' 
effort was aimed at distorting well-known facts. 
  Rasid stressed that the introduction of new elements in the 
talks -- elements aimed at satisfying the Greek Cypriot side -- 
will create a deadlock in the negotiating process. He said: 
"As the experts who follow the talks on the confidence-building 
measures on Maras [Varosha] and the Nicosia International 
Airport have seen, the main reasons for the present deadlock are 
the Greek Cypriot side's pressure and the attempt to deviate 
from the original package of confidence-building measures and 
add new elements to it in order to satisfy Glavkos Kliridhis and 
the Greek Cypriot side."

  [Text] Nationalist Action Party [NAP] leader Alparslan 
Turkes has said that the NAP emerged from the local elections 
with great success because of its consistent and stable policies 
focused on unity and the integrity of the country. 
  At a news conference he held in parliament, Turkes said that 
even though certain circles expected the NAP to weaken because 
some deputies had left it, the party increased its votes in 
municipal councils by 250 percent and the number of its mayors 
by 300 percent, to 155. 
  Turkes said that the citizens in eastern and southeastern 
Turkey showed in the elections that they do not want to secede. 
He added: The election results are a good lesson to those who 
try to interfere in Turkey's domestic affairs. 
  Turkes pointed out that the NAP received good results in 
eastern and southeastern Anatolia. He said: The elections were 
held in a mature way, with a high rate of participation. They 
resulted in a victory for democracy. 
  The NAP leader stated that the citizens voted in favor of 
maintaining the coalition, adding: The election results show 
that the people do not want chaos, or the state business to be 
delayed through frequent elections. They show that the people 
want the present coalition to remain power. That is my 
conclusion.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 29 (A.A.) -- The Pro-Islamic 
Prosperity Party (RP) won the Ankara mayoral election, according 
to the latest unofficial results on Tuesday [30 March]. 
  Melih Gokcek, the RP candidate won by a narrow margin over 
Social Democrat Populist Party (SHP) candidate Korel Goymen. 
  The RP made sweeping gains across the country to take third 
place overall behind Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's center-right 
True Path Party (DYP) and the main opposition Motherland Party 
(ANAP). 
  The RP doubled its share of the vote since the last 
nationwide municipal elections in 1989. 
  Campaigning for a "just order" and adherence to conservative 
Islamic values, the RP has found support among the rural 
migrants who flocked to the major cities in search of jobs. 
  The party has never made a serious impact in Ankara, a city 
of 3 million and cradle of the secular Turkish Republic founded 
by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923.

  [Text] Istanbul, Mar. 30 (A.A.) -- Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
said on Tuesday [29 March] that his fundamentalist Prosperity 
Party (RP) won local elections in six mayoral races and 22 
borough representative races. 
  "The wall put between the RP and the people will be removed 
much more easier from now on," Erdogan said. 
  After his victory in the Istanbul mayoral race, the biggest 
metropolitan center in Turkey with a population of 10 million, 
Erdogan held a press conference. 
  He said that the 14,627 ballot boxes that have been counted 
showed that his RP received 913,580 votes or 25.84 percent of 
the total vote in Sunday's elections. 
  "The people will witness the practices of the RP and will 
run 
to a bright future with us," he said. 
  He also claimed that the "mentality of RP which has been a 
minority so far, will be a majority in Turkey." 
  The RP's sweeping local elections victory and its new mayor 
for Istanbul worried many over what the future would bring. 
  A statue of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern 
secular Turkey, stands in historic Taksim Square. 
  But Erdogan declared Tuesday: "I will build a mosque in 
Taksim." 
  During his election campaign, Erdogan promised to invite 
Pierre Cardin to arrange a women's fashion show for 
Islamic-style dressing. He also said he would close Istanbul's 
brothels. 
  The anti-Western and anti-Israeli RP, which also won many 
borough representative races in Istanbul, has caused concern 
among Western-educated Turks. It also has women worrying 
whether they would be forced to wear the chador (head-to-toe 
black Islamic garb). 
  Beyoglu, Istanbul's picturesque and cosmopolitan district, 
is 
threatened with the closure of its bars, amusement places and 
brothels. 
  And there may be no more new year's celebrations at Beyoglu. 
"That's a Christian tradition," says Beyoglu borough 
representative-elect Nusret Bayraktar, "we cannot allow a 
prophet's birthday to be celebrated with drinking, gambling and 
prostitution." 
  Intellectual Turks, upper middle class people, minorities 
and 
foreigners who form the mosaic of this city and meet in the 
melting pot of Beyoglu say a new, unwelcome era has dawned on 
Istanbul. 
  Although the new fundamentalist mayor as well as his 
district 
colleagues promised a better Istanbul in their post-election 
statements, the intelligentsia is not convinced. 
  The resurgence of women in Islamic dress with heads covered 
and religious bearded men wearing turbans worries followers of 
Kemal Ataturk, who adopted the Western dress code and declared 
Turkey a secular republic.

  [Text] Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly [TGNA], has said that the great majority of 
the people want Turkey to join the European Union [EU] and the 
customs union. 
  He was speaking to Willy Claes, Belgian vice prime minister 
and minister of foreign affairs, who visited him today. 
Cindoruk pointed out that Turkey's policy toward Europe is 
developing positively and that this is partly due to 
intergovernmental relations. He explained that if Turkey 
overcomes its economic difficulties a little more, then there 
will be no obstacle before its membership in the customs union. 
The TGNA speaker stressed that the Assembly will support the 
efforts to adapt the existing legislation to the customs union. 
  Willy Claes pointed out that Turkey will join the customs 
union in 1995 and that this is a very important step toward full 
membership in the EU.

  [Text] Turkey has described as utterly unacceptable the 
Greek Government's arbitrary decisions to eliminate the most 
basic rights of the Turkish minority in Western Thrace granted 
to them by international agreements. 
  Replying to a question at this weekly news conference today, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman recalled that Article 
40 of the Lausanne Treaty grants the Turkish minority in Western 
Thrace the right to establish, run, and inspect its own 
educational institutions. Within this framework, Ataman said, 
Turkish teachers from Western Thrace are supposed to teach in 
the minority schools. However, he added, the Greek Education 
Ministry terminated these teachers' contracts and announced that 
it would appoint the teachers itself. 
  Ataman explained that following this decision, the Turkish 
teachers started a boycott of the schools from 28 March to 1 
April, with 100 percent participation. He stressed that in this 
way, the Western Thrace Turkish minority protected its rights 
and expressed its reaction to the decision by the Greek 
authorities. He added: The elimination by the Greek Government, 
through arbitrary decisions, of the most basic rights of the 
Turkish minority in Western Thrace -- rights granted to them 
through international agreements -- is utterly unacceptable. We 
are making the necessary representations to ensure that the 
decision is corrected. At every forum, Turkey will continue to 
raise and elaborate on the issue of the violation of human 
rights in the Western Thrace. We expect and demand the Greek 
Government to stop this unjust practice as soon as possible. 
  Asked to comment on Greek press reports that Turkish 
warplanes intensively violated Greek airspace on 25 March, 
Ataman said that Turkish planes carried out routine and 
individual training flights in the international airspace of the 
Aegean on 25 March, flights that do not call for issuing an 
alert to pilots. He said: Planes of the Turkish Air Force have 
been carrying out training and exercise flights in the 
international airspace of the Aegean for years, within the 
framework of rights granted to them by international law. 
During these flights, the pilots are always careful not to 
violate the 6-mile national Greek airspace.

<F P=106> [Report entitled: "According to Ciller, Deficit Totals 143 </F>
Trillion Turkish Lira"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that the 
deficit incurred by the public sector, which has come to be 
known as the "black hole" and that has caused a crisis in 
Turkey's economy, totals 143 trillion Turkish lira. 
  In an economic booklet entitled "Quite Frankly," Ciller has 
outlined her economic work and said that the Public Economic 
Enterprises deficit totaled 60 trillion Turkish lira in 1993. 
According to Ciller, the Social Insurance Organization incurred 
a deficit of 25 trillion and the Social Security Association for 
Tradesmen, Artisans, and Independent Workers a deficit of 6 
trillion in 1993. While the annual loss incurred by the 
Agricultural Unions totaled 30 trillion, the Zonguldak Coal 
Mines Establishment incurred a loss of 22 trillion. Some 8 
trillion was lost because of a reduction in operations and 14 
trillion due to the payment of wages. 
  Ciller's booklet said the credits that were given to the AU 
were used for employment, capital spending for operational 
purposes, and other expenses. But the unions failed to pay 
their debts. The booklet recalled that the local 
administrations can allocate only 30 percent of their budgets to 
personnel and said that several local administrations have been 
unable to meet their personnel's needs even by using all their 
budget funds. It said: "That negative condition will be 
removed through the reforms that will be effected in the local 
administrations." 
  Ciller recalled that the budget deficit was 33 trillion 
Turkish lira in 1990 and stressed that the deficit was expected 
to rise to 192 trillion in 1994. She asserted: "The budget 
deficit has increased because of the gradually increasing 
interest payments since 1986, payment of high wages and salaries 
since 1989, failure to solve the structural problems in the PEE 
and social insurance organizations, and inefficiency in 
privatization."

We welcome the U.S. efforts to find a solution or a way out of 
the deadlock. Our talks could be described as positive. This is 
our first meeting and I am sure there will be more. Nimetz will 
continue his talks with the prime minister. 
  I believe this is what I could tell you now as the initial 
result of a first meeting that is over traditional frameworks 
and frameworks of simple meetings. Thank you. 
  [Nimetz] I am greatly honored that President Clinton has 
asked me to take on this significant mission. This dispute 
threatens the security and stability in a region that is very 
important to the United States. We had discussions this morning 
in Skopje and we had discussions here. And we will continue the 
discussions. 
  Our goal is to assist in achieving a solution under the 
auspices of UN mediator Cyrus Vance. I do not think I will say 
anything more. We will persevere in this effort and I hope the 
outcome will be positive.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias by </F>
unidentified correspondents in Athens--recorded] 
  [Text] [Papoulias] The prime minister received Matthew 
Nimetz, the U.S. President's envoy to The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and held a discussion in a 
friendly atmosphere. The prime minister explained the Greek 
position. President Bill Clinton is greatly interested in a 
solution; Nimetz will divide his time between Skopje and Athens 
at this time. I believe I cannot say anything more because it 
would only be predictions. 
  The climate is positive. There is U.S. interest and the 
personal interest of President Clinton. I hope in the next few 
weeks we will have some positive results. 
  [Correspondent] Did Skopje make any conciliatory moves? 
  [Papoulias] I do not know if Skopje gave any indications of 
being conciliatory. Certainly, though, there are people in 
Skopje who believe that a solution is necessary. 
  [Correspondent] Did Nimetz bring any new proposals? 
  [Papoulias] Nimetz did not bring any new ideas. He listened 
to the views of the Greek Government. We exchanged views on how 
we can overcome some obstacles. I believe the next few days 
will be more productive and effective because Nimetz intends to 
visit Skopje very soon and then return to Athens. 
  [Correspondent] When will he return? 
  [Papoulias] I do not know about this, but I have told you 
that Nimetz will visit Skopje and Athens in the next few days. 
  [Correspondent] Did Mr. Nimetz ask that the measures be 
unilaterally lifted? 
  [Papoulias] No, Nimetz certainly discussed the sanctions but 
both the prime minister and I explained to him the reasons why 
Greece adopted these measures. 
  [Correspondent] Does the United States view the measures as 
political or economic? 
  [Papoulias] Look, there has been no evaluation on how they 
view the measures. The measures are certainly included in the 
negotiations package. 
  [Correspondent] Did he ask for a unilateral lifting of the 
measures? 
  [Papoulias] No. 
  [Correspondent] Did Mr. Nimetz set the prime minister's 
visit 
as a deadline for progress? 
  [Papoulias] He considers that the prime minister's visit is 
a 
framework within which some progress should be made. 
  [Correspondent] Are there any ideas on lifting the measures 
temporarily? 
  [Papoulias] No, I have told you that.

<F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham] </F>
  [Excerpt] The United States is in a hurry for a solution to 
the issue of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] 
and agreed to separate the name issue from the initial phase of 
dialogue. Therefore, during his meeting with EU Commissioner 
Hans van den Broek yesterday, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
found it easier to reject the European Union's [EU] unilateral 
mediation effort. 
  Reliable information and the recent talks between Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou and his U.S. counterpart in 
the United States indicate that the U.S. Government is in a 
hurry to resolve the issue of FYROM, claiming that [FYROM 
President Kiro] Gligorov's state may collapse. 
<H5>  Name Separation </H5>
  According to the same information, the Americans made it 
clear to the Greek side that they want very much to see the 
issue of FYROM resolved as soon as possible so that they can 
jointly (Greece and the United States) "discuss regional 
cooperation in the Balkans." 
  The United States also seemed to have accepted the Greek 
position to separate FYROM's name from the initial phase of the 
dialogue, because maintaining stability in the region is more 
important. 
  The same sources said that Washington did not put pressure 
on 
Athens to lift the Greek measures, but expressed the "wish" that 
"something would be done" in this direction. 
  Diplomatic sources mentioned that Ambassador Matthew Nimetz, 
President Clinton's special envoy to Skopje, (who will meet the 
prime minister and the foreign minister today and will later go 
to FYROM), will undertake a very important mediation role and 
will have an "open line" to UN mediator Cyrus Vance. 
  According to the same information, Vance--as he had 
said--intends to deal with the "substance of the issue," that 
is, bring the two sides back to the negotiating table. Nimetz 
will undertake the "details" (conditions, requirements, etc.). 
  On the eve of the United States' active involvement in the 
issue of FYROM, the government essentially "stopped" the EU 
unilateral mediation effort. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will reshuffle the 
government after the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] 
congress and before the European Parliament elections, to wage 
the election battle with the "confidence" of a renewed 
government. According to reliable sources, he believes some 
correctional changes are necessary to give new impetus to the 
sectors that are not functioning well and to deal with the 
problem of lack of coordination within the government. 
  According to the same sources, the prime minister intends to 
give a portfolio to Dhimitrios Tsovolas and replace Education 
Minister Dhimitrios Fatouros. 
  He is also considering whether he should remove Alternate 
Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos during the shuffle or after 
the expiration of the Greek European Union presidency in July. 
  The situation at the top of the National Economy Ministry 
will remain unchanged unless Finance Minister Yeoryios 
Yennimatas decides to move up to the government's vice 
presidency or resign. In this case, his replacement will be 
either Bhouttos, Vaitsos, or Pottakis.

  [Text] New York (DPA) -- On Friday [25 March] UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali expressed the hope that Germany will make a 
greater contribution to the work of the United Nations. In a 
talk with Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union group in the German 
Bundestag, he was, however, very restrained regarding any 
specific demands: Germany itself must decide what the greater 
German involvement in the United Nations should be like. 
  The United Nations has many and great needs, Butrus-Ghali 
said. Schaeuble pointed out that Germany has gone through 
considerable learning processes regarding its new international 
role since 1989 and has made considerable progress in this 
respect. 
  Butrus-Ghali stressed that in the United Nations the issue 
is 
not at all just blue helmet soldiers and peacekeeping -- this 
amounts to only 20 to 30 percent. More than half of the UN 
activities and also of his own work refer to social problems in 
the world, from environmental protection to development aid to 
population issues, the secretary general stressed. 
  The critical financial situation of the United Nations 
played 
a considerable role. Schaeuble stressed his readiness to 
advocate more intensively the interests of the international 
organization. However, as a parliamentarian and as the leader of 
the parliamentary majority, he can do this only if it is 
possible to define clearly the work of the United Nations and to 
make its success visible. 
  The financial means that were available for the Cold War, 
Butrus-Ghali complained, are in no proportion to those that are 
used to eliminate the relics of this period. Schaeuble assured 
the secretary general that Germany will certainly not leave him 
alone with his important task. 
  Before the talk with Butrus-Ghali Schaeuble had met with 
Russian UN Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsev. Both expressed the hope 
that the worst military conflicts in the former Yugoslavia are 
now over. However, Vorontsev expressed the fear that the 
negotiations about a peace settlement might take years. It has 
been shown that the United Nations cannot force anyone to accept 
a peaceful solution, Vorontsev said.

  FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has already phoned 
Koschnick. The former Bremen mayor has accepted the offer. 
Details must still be clarified, Kinkel said. The ministers'

<F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F>
reporter] 
  [Excerpt] The Prime Minister insisted today that Britain 
had wrung sufficient "concessions" from its European partners to 
accept the so-called Greek compromise on voting powers. 
  To Opposition jeers in the Commons, Mr Major said in a 
statement after this morning's Cabinet meeting on the issue, 
that "progress on qualified majority voting was sufficient to be 
acceptable until 1996." But a grim signal of trouble ahead from 
Conservative Euro-rebels came in furious exchanges between Tory 
Tony Marlow and the Prime Minister who was clearly enraged as Mr 
Marlow told him: "As of now, My Right Honourable Friend has no 
authority, credibility or identifiable policy in this vital 
area!" 
  MPs gasped as Mr Marlow added: "Why don't you stand aside 
and 
make way for somebody else who provides authority...and 
direction of leadership?" 
  Mr Major told a packed chamber there would then be a "root 
and branch" review of the voting system -- which has been at the 
centre of the row between Britain and her EU [European Union] 
partners -- at the next inter-governmental conference. 
  The Prime Minister acknowledged that the weekend talks 
between EU foreign ministers in Greece had met many but not all 
of the Government's concerns. He said assurances had now been 
received from the European Commission over the bringing forward 
of proposals under the guise of Health and Safety articles, 
which were not strictly relevant to the subject. 
  Labour leader John Smith branded the compromise agreement a 
"humiliating climbdown" for Mr Major and added: "You seek to 
camouflage your retreat from your vainglorious assertions of no 
surrender." He said fear of warring factions in Tory Party had 
propelled the Prime Minister "into an unwise conflict which you 
could not -- and did not win." 
  In his statement, Mr Major said the Government had opposed 
an 
unqualified extension in the blocking minority in votes to 27 
because ministers were concerned that successive extensions had 
"weakened the democratic legitimacy of the Community." 
Assurances had now been received from the Commission that "it 
will not bring forwrd any further proposals under the Health and 
Safety articles under its term of office except for measures 
directly and demonstrably relevant to health and safety at work." 
  The Commission had also now agreed that proposals under the 
Social Chapter "will not embrace people or organisations in the 
UK. For the purposes of the Social Chapter, the UK will be 
entirely excluded from legislation." 
  He said: "The proposal on qualified majority voting (QMV) 
negotiated by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd at the weekend 
meets many -- though not all -- of the Government's concerns." 
Agreement had been secured that the review of QMV in 1996 would 
include voting thresholds as well as the number of votes 
attributed to each member state. "At the request of the UK and 
Spain, the transitional arrangements from accession until 1996 
will no longer provide for unqualified extension of the blocking 
minority to 27. The Council is under a legal and binding 
obligation to seek agreement on the basis of a minority of at 
least 23 votes." The Government expected this obligation to be 
upheld scrupulously, he insisted. 
  Mr Major said: "On this basis, the Cabinet has concluded 
that 
since we wish to see the enlargement proceed, progress on QMV 
was sufficient to be acceptable until 1996. We are informing 
the Presidency that, provided the concessions made to the UK and 
Spain are accepted without qualification by other member states, 
the UK can accept this interim proposal. 
  ``Enlargement will bring into the Union countries which 
share 
Britain's open trading instincts.... It will be another large 
step towards the wider, less centralised, open trading Europe 
for which we are working.'' 
  Mr Smith said: "However you seek to camouflage your retreat 
from your vainglorious assertions of no surrender last week, you 
have accepted a blocking minority of 27. Isn't your supposed 
triumph of obtaining a minor period of delay hopelessly 
undermined by the text of the declaration itself?" 
  He asked if the so-called assurances from the Commission 
would extend beyond the end of the year and added: "You have had 
to make a humiliating climbdown. Isn't the explanation for the 
timing and whole sorry fiasco that you, fearful of the warring 
factions in your own party, propelled yourself into an unwise 
conflict, which you could not and did not win." It had resulted 
in "unnecessary and severe damage to friendly countries and no 
advantage to Britain." 
  Mr Major said a number of the Labour leader's points were 
"factually inaccurate." He said: "What you appear to have 
overlooked is that we have achieved a series of concessions that 
would not have been available if we had adopted your position of 
accepting, without let or hindrance, 27 for all areas 
immediately. 
  ``We have not achieved the maintenance of the blocking 
majority of 23. I would have ideally preferred that. But 
neither have the other member states achieved what they would 
have wished -- for we have obtained concessions particularly 
that protect our most vulnerable flank on social affairs.'' 
  To Labour jeers, he admitted that the agreement with the 
Commission lasted only until the end of the year but added: "We 
will certainly be seeking an extension under the new Commission 
next year and I see no reason to suppose we won't achieve it."

<F P=106> ["ulf"-signed report: "Billion-Dollar Deal With Iraq in the </F>
Offing"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 28 Mar -- Without knowing it, 
Baden-Wuerttemberg is second -- after Jordan -- on the list of 
Iraq's new trading partners. Of the applications for trading 
permits totalling over $8.6 billion that are being considered by 
the UN Iraq Sanctions Commission in New York, Jordan accounts 
for $5.4 billion and Baden-Wuerrtemberg for a further $1.3 
billion. The land authorities evidently have no knowledge of 
this. An application for this unusual billion-dollar deal was 
quietly lodged through the Foreign Ministry by a Mannheim-based 
jewelry designer in the middle of February without the knowledge 
of the Federal Export Agency in Eschborn. The Mannheim citizen 
is now suspected by the Iraq Sanctions Commission of wanting to 
help Iraq circumvent sanctions. 
  According to UN information, a Mannheim-based company 
applied 
for the delivery of goods worth a total of $1.343 billion (2.3 
billion German marks [DM]) to Iraq. On 14 February, the Foreign 
Ministry passed on the application from the "United Oil Company" 
-- according to the Mannheim Registration Court, it does not 
appear in the register of companies there and does not have a 
phone of its own -- under filename "SA 1402 U 6" to the Iraq 
Sanctions Commission in New York through the German 
representation there without, it seems, informing itself on the 
background of the company. According to its letterhead, the 
company is based at Friedrichsplatz in Mannheim. The address and 
the name of the applicant are identical with the small firm "Ary 
Design Jewelry" located on the first floor of an apartment 
block. There is no sign at the entrance to the building or on 
the door of the apartment that would indicate anything about the 
"United Oil Company." 
  A. Schweininger, who is listed in the register of companies 
as the owner of "Ary Design Jewelry," applied to the Foreign 
Ministry on behalf of the "United Oil Company." According to 
the Mannheim Registration Court, the jewelry business is 
involved in the "the design, buying and selling, import and 
export of jewelry, especially under the name Ary Design." Now, 
Schweininger is seeking a permit in New York for a 
billion-dollar deal with Iraq. 
  Apparently Schweininger wants to export food, soap, and 
other 
goods to Iraq. All in all, the deal involves the delivery of 
1,927 million tonnes of goods (palm oil, soap, sugar, chickens, 
corned beef, beans, and other items) to Iraq through the 
Jordanian port of Aqaba. According to UN information, the port 
can only be used by ships with a maximum tonnage of 36,000 
tonnes, which means that more than 50 freighters would be needed 
for the delivery of all the goods. The exceptional size of the 
order caused -- in contrast to the reaction of the German 
authorities -- raised eyebrows at the United Nations. 
  That is why the United Nations in New York, which was still 
of the opinion that the "United Oil Company" must be a large 
German company in the middle of February, checked the identity 
of the recipient in Jordan. The Amman post box number that 
appeared in the applications (post box 35284) turned out to be 
the address of a hotel belonging to a well-known international 
chain. Only hotel guests who want to "disguise" the fact that 
the recipient is a hotel guest use the post box number, was the 
answer from Amman. Both the recipient in Jordan and the final 
customer are Iraqi 'Usama 'Abed (post box 55026, Baghdad). 
  After the German UN representation was told that the 
billion-dollar order it supported had an unusual foundation, to 
say the least, it did not withdraw the application, but asked 
only that Schweininger lodge an application with the Federal 
Export Agency in Eschborn. On Monday [28 March], a spokesman 
for the agency did not want to say whether the application had 
already been lodged. However, on 18 March, a request for a 
permit was lodged with the Federal Foodstuffs Agency for part of 
the export consignment. Bonn is still supporting the efforts of 
the Baden-Wuerttemberg jewelry designer to conclude a 
billion-dollar deal. 
  In New York, UN employees took a closer look at 
Schweininger's delivery list and were astonished. Quite a 
number of goods on the list are to be obtained for unusual 
prices. Thus, Schweininger wants to export 100,000 tonnes of 
German made "soap" to Iraq at a price of four dollars (DM6.8) a 
tonne. As even the cheapest soap in Germany cannot be bought 
for that price, questions are being asked about whether 
Schweininger really wants to obtain the goods. On the other 
hand, other prices on the delivery applications -- such as palm 
oil --seem to be far too high. 
  The United Nations has in the meantime acquired enough 
experience about Iraqi inventiveness to expose at least a few 
cases where the only aim of trade applications was evidently to 
release Iraqi foreign currency reserves, not to supply aid. In 
December, for example, an application from a Finnish company to 
export 3 million tonnes of sugar to Iraq was withdrawn. As 
annual sugar consumption in Iraq amounts to no more than 500,000 
tonnes and sugar cannot be stored for years, it was quickly 
realized that the Iraqis sole aim was to release foreign 
currency reserves. The United Nations is astonished to say the 
least that the unusual billion-dollar application from the 
"United Oil Company," which is not registered, at any rate not 
in Germany, had not been withdrawn by Monday lunchtime. 
  Anyone who wants to reach Schweininger under the telephone 
number -- it is identical to that of "Ary Design Jewelry" -- 
given in the "United Oil Company" letterhead, is connected with 
a answering machine with the following message: "Good day, you 
are connected with our Mannheim bureau. There is no one in our 
bureau at the moment. Please leave a message after the signal." 
Despite the unusual features of the billion-dollar deal, the 
Iraq Sanctions Commission will have to approve it in the next 
few days, not least because the German authorities have declined 
assistance so far. In addition, the deliveries of foodstuffs 
that Schweininger has applied for at the United Nations are only 
covered by a "notification requirement." Whether the goods will 
actually be later delivered will not be checked. That is why a 
first partial permit is "ready for signing" on UN desks.

  [Excerpts] A Franco-Italian riddle: which one is imitating 
the other? Is Berlusconi trying to be a right-wing Tapie, or is 
Tapie trying to be a left-wing Berlusconi? On this side of the 
Alps, Bernard Tapie, the chairman of OM [Marseille soccer club], 
has just been elected in the cantonal elections and is making a 
bid for the Marseille mayoralty. On the other side of the Alps, 
Silvio Berlusconi, the chairman of AC Milan [Milan soccer club] 
has just won the legislative elections and is making a bid for 
the post of prime minister. [passage omitted] 
  National Front Chairman Jean-Marie Le Pen has hailed the 
victory of the Right in Italy. UDF [French Democratic Union] 
Minister Alain Madelin hopes that France, too, will wake up in 
the Italian way. On the contrary, Socialist Julien Dray, the 
guest of France Inter this morning, sees an open door to every 
potential danger in Berlusconi's victory. Of course, the 
reaction of French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is more 
diplomatic than all the others. He spoke to Quentin Dickinson 
in Luxembourg: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] [Juppe] I do not want to pass 
judgement on the democratic choices of other peoples. They are 
responsible and sovereign. The Italian people have made their 
choice. I have no particular comment to make. I only hope the 
new Italian Government that ensues from these elections will be 
able to maintain its support for Europe, which Italy has always 
steadfastly done, and of course that it will maintain active 
cooperation with France. We have a lot of things to do with 
Italy in particular in the Mediterranean area where the 
situation is so unstable. France is a Mediterranean power and 
so is Italy. This is why we will pay particular attention to 
the political decisions that will be taken. 
  [Dickinson] Does this mean you do not have any particular 
concern? 
  [Juppe] I repeat I have no reason to pass judgement on what 
the Italians have done. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Felipe Gonzalez today asked the PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] to make an effort toward unity and 
integration during the series of regional conferences that start 
in April and continue onwards. This is how the PSOE secretary 
general summarized part of the debate that took place at the 
first meeting of the executive committee of the Socialist Party 
elected at the recent Socialist federal congress. The decision 
of who is to be spokesperson was postponed until next Tuesday [5 
April], although Felipe Gonzalez hinted that the new secretary 
of the organization, Cipria Ciscar, might take up the job. 
[passage omitted] 
  Ciscar, Benegas, Marugan, Obiols, and Almunia belong to a 
commission that is to suggest names and ideas for the European 
elections -- elections after which Gonzalez is sure he will not 
dissolve parliament. Moreover, he is optimistic about the 
results. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] There will not be any 
dissolution. 
There will not be a causal effect between one process and the 
other whatever the result may be. And may I add, I think the 
result is that we will win. [end recording] 
  Gonzalez also says he is not too worried by the approval 
[ratings] of his leadership shown by some polls, nor is he 
worried by what the polls have to say about PSOE election 
results. He thinks this data is linked to the crisis and that 
the results will improve as soon as the citizens become aware of 
the economic upturn. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] I think that the citizens are 
holding us responsible for the excess of internal divisions. So 
if we are able to demonstrate two things -- more internal unity 
and more success on the economic front, thanks to the 
considerable efforts being made -- I think that the tendency 
will change. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Erik Bjorn Moller report: "Center Democrats Fall Below </F>
Threshold"] 
  [Text] The governing party, the Center Democrats [CD], 
again has fallen below the threshold for representation in the 
Folketing. However, the Social Democratic Party [SDP] is unable 
to understand the party's major losses in this months Gallup 
opinion poll. 
  It is understandable that the Center Democrats should be 
losing voters after the infamous affair involving Bente Juncker, 
the former social affairs minister who accused the head of an 
institution of the sexual abuse of the mentally subnormal. 
  Such are the comments from several Social Democrats after 
BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's new Gallup poll today. On the other hand 
they are unable to understand why the Social Democrats have lost 
more than 4.2 percent of voter support since the February poll. 
  However, Interior Minister Birte Weiss (Social Democratic 
Party) is well able to understand why the Liberal Party is 
"slowly but surely" continuing its downturn -- this time from 
26.9 percent to 25.8 percent of votes. "The closer we come to 
the elections, the greater will be the nervousness of those 
drifting voters who have sought refuge with the Liberal Party," 
Interior Minister Birte Weiss said. She also said that Liberal 
Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's "unsavory manner" is 
gradually causing voters to beg off. 
  Conservative People's Party leader Hans Engell is extremely 
satisfied with his party's continued success. He stressed that 
"people must now count on a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party 
majority as a real possibility." And he believes that Prime 
Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is facing a reverse "prime 
minister effect" [the effect of increased support in opinion 
polls for the party providing the prime minister in a coalition 
government]: 
  "There is much to indicate that Nyrup Rasmussen is pulling 
everything down for the Social Democrats," Engell said.

  [Text] The information that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the 
Russian Liberal Democrat leader, is to visit Finland has been 
received without any upsurge of emotion. Zhirinovskiy will 
arrive in Finland next week with a Russian parliamentary 
delegation. Many European countries have closed their doors to 
Zhirinovskiy, who expresses ultranationalistic views. President 
Martti Ahtisaari does not see any problems in the visit of the 
controversial politician. 
  [Begin Ahtisaari recording] Well, that was expected because 
the invitation was sent, and in that sense there is no surprise 
there, at least not in my case. It was open as to who would be 
included in the delegation. 
  Everybody who can get a visa to Finland is welcome. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto also takes a 
relaxed view about Zhirinovskiy's visit to Finland. Haavisto 
said that he heard about the visit at the Eduskunta. 
  [Begin Haavisto recording] He will mainly be a guest of the 
Eduskunta and I have received the information from the Eduskunta 
that he is coming. I do not think there will be any very 
disorderly conduct because he is a representative of an official 
delegation and of course, one should take things as they come. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] Zhirinovskiy will take part in a seminar on 
Tuesday and Wednesday [5-6 April] at the Eduskunta. The seminar 
will discuss Russia joining the Council of Europe.

  [Text] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has 
stated that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller should first openly 
declare to the public that the coalition is dissolved before 
making a call to the rightist parties to unite. 
  Answering reporters' questions at the Istanbul Airport, 
Yilmaz stated that the True Path Party [TPP] was the real loser 
of the 27 March elections. Pointing out that the TPP, as the 
party in power, should have obtained at least an additional two 
to three points, Yilmaz added that the differences between ANAP 
and the TPP is reduced to 1 percent. 
  In answer to a question on Ciller's call at her assembly 
group meeting for the right to unite, Yilmaz said: 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] Ciller should first openly declare 
to the public that the coalition has dissolved before she makes 
a statement like this. As far as I know, they [TPP] are arguing 
that they are working in harmony with their coalition partners. 
Saying they are partners in a coalition, and calling for the 
right to unite, seems contradictory to me. Furthermore, we do 
not share their views regarding the messages that emerged from 
these elections. We do not think the election results call for 
the unification of the right. [end recording] 
  Assessing the election results in Istanbul, Yilmaz said that 
the persistent guidance of the press and the public opinion 
polls contributed to the results and added: What emerged in 
these elections is that all that guidance and efforts actually 
counter reacted. 
  Yilmaz said that it is too early to assess the 27 March 
local 
election results, and added that they will assess the situation 
following the final results.

  [Excerpt] Ankara, Mar. 30 (A.A.) -- Social Democratic 
Populist Party [SDPP] Secretary General Metin Culhaoglu said on 
Tuesday [29 March] that Turkey has never witnessed such a moral 
flaw in the election system. 
  "These elections have been tainted," Culhaoglu said. 
  In a statement from his party's headquarters, Culhaoglu said 
that they have received claims that the results of local polls 
have been distorted. 
  He said that they have received great numbers of ballots 
casted for his party that were found in trash cans and that they 
found a printing house in the central Anatolian city of Kayseri 
which was printing ballots. 
  Culhaoglu said that the SDPP applied to the Prosecutor's 
Office, claiming fraud and petitioned the High Election Board. 
  "Fraud claims are pouring in from all over the country," he 
said. "These claims show that an organized action has been 
carried out throughout the country." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Lucy Walker article: "Pressure on Workers' Rights </F>
Threatens Fragile GATT Deal"] 
  [Text] A Disagreement over plans to incorporate workers 
rights into international free trade rules threatens to shatter 
a fragile coalition of support for the Uruguay Round of GATT, 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, little more than a 
fortnight before the world trade agreement is due to be signed. 
  Plans to put workers' rights on the agenda of the proposed 
World Trade Organisation are being pushed vigorously by the 
United States and France, but have angered almost 100 developing 
countries. 
  India's ambassador to GATT, Balkrishnon Zutshi, has warned 
that divisions over the need for a "social clause" could wreck 
the Uruguay Round agreement due to be signed by ministers from 
119 countries in Marrakesch next month after eight years of 
negotiation. 
  The GATT's 45-year-old improvised structure is to be 
subsumed 
into a new, more powerful, world trade watchdog, the World Trade 
Organisation, at the meeting in Morocco between 12 and 15 April. 
  Peter Sutherland, the Director General of GATT, who is 
expected to become the first head of the WTO, has given cautious 
endorsement to the introduction of a social clause in world 
trade legislation -- once the WTO is operational. However, 
aggressive lobbying by Washington has forced the European Union 
[EU] to bring forward the discussion. The EU wants to prevent 
the Clinton Administration stealing a march on it to set the 
agenda, unopposed, before Marrakesch. 
  The United States argues that the trade liberalising 
benefits 
of the Uruguay Round should not boost countries which produce 
cheap goods by exploiting workers. It wants to see child and 
forced labour banned and trade union rights guaranteed. 
Countries that do not meet international social standards 
should be penalised by losing trade privileges. 
  Developing countries, which now comprise more than 
two-thirds 
of GATT members, protest that export revenue is a vital 
ingredient in new social reform programmes. 
  Some countries stand to lose more than others. Wouldbe GATT 
member China has been criticised for its sweatshop work regime 
and a host of other Asian countries are likely to fall foul of 
Western standards which legislate against child labour. 
Introducing a social clause into the GATT has the backing of a 
worldwide coalition of trade union organisations. The 
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, World 
Confederation of Labour, and European Trade Union Confederation, 
argue that in order to "improve social conditions, the most 
appropriate way to prevent social dumping is to include social 
clauses in trade agreements." 
  They say that: "Only in the last resort would trade 
sanctions 
be used as a penalty for non co-operation." 
  The unions also have an unlikely ally in Sir Leon Brittan, 
the European Trade Commissioner, who believes a social clause 
should be put firmly on the WTO agenda. "It will be a more 
political organisation, with a wider remit and more frequent 
direct ministerial involvement, than has been the case for 
GATT," he told members of the European Parliament. 
  Brittan, however, warns against heavy-handed bullying by the 
West. He said: "I think that if these principles are more 
widely understood, developing country governments will come to 
accept that the WTO [World Trade Organisation] should have a 
social dimension." 
  This view is not yet universally accepted, however. The 
European Employers, Federation (UNICE) is wary of carving social 
standards into stone, urging the need to avoid simplistic 
solutions. 
  "The issues of social clauses are important; they uphold the 
aims of protecting children, and other areas of civil liberty. 
But we wouldn't go along with putting this into GATT yet," said 
a spokeswoman for the business lobby. UNICE argues instead for 
faster growth and higher living standards as the route to 
improved conditions. 
  Euro-MP Bartho Pronk, a Dutch Christian Democrat, says that 
in order to be fair and effective the social clause should be 
limited to fundamental and minimum standards. 
  Pronk argues that compliance with the social clause should 
only be applied to countries seeking preferential trading status 
under the GATT or another -- bilateral or regional -- trading 
arrangements. The idea is not new, notes Pronk. Levi Strauss, 
perhaps the best known brand of denim clothing, and the Swiss 
retailer Migros already insist that suppliers and 
sub-contractors respect minimum standards, including a ban on 
child labour. But he says the EU must decide first whether a 
social clause in GATT, or other trade agreements, such as the 
Union's generalised system of preferences, is an instrument of 
trade or social policy. 
  Low wages alone are insufficient reason for the introduction 
of a social clause. Pronk says: "While huge disparities in 
labour costs do exist within the international economy I am of 
the view that this should not be the basis of a social clause. 
To do so would be to penalise the less developed countries for 
their level of development and would open the social clause to 
criticism that it is Western protectionism in another form."

<F P=106> [Interview with IAEA Director General Hans Blix by Gerhard </F>
Bitzan; place and date not given: "North Korea Must Allow 
Nuclear Inspections"] 
  [Text] [Bitzan] How strong is the nuclear threat today 
after the end of the Cold War? 
  [Blix] If I take a look at the international media, I 
actually have the feeling that the spread of nuclear weapons is 
the biggest danger in the world, and that there are numerous 
states in the world that are only waiting to buy or build their 
own nuclear weapons -- without any control. However, one must 
also see the progress: A number of former risk states, 
including Brazil and Argentina, but also South Africa, have 
voluntarily given up their nuclear ambitions. There will be 
nuclear-free zones in Africa and Latin America, and even in the 
Middle East, talks on such a zone are under way. 
  [Bitzan] Has the collapse of the Soviet Union not made the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons uncontrollable? 
  [Blix] It has certainly increased the danger. Ukraine, for 
example, has not joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
Then there is also the risk of the "leakage" of know-how and of 
nuclear material from the former USSR. Yet, so far we have not 
seen a single case of the illegal export of enriched uranium, 
which is required for atomic bombs. As far as plutonium is 
concerned, the quantities were very, very small -- grams or 
milligrams. 
  An increasing number of developing countries are able to 
develop nuclear weapons if they use all their funds on this 
project. Yet the danger that has often been conjured up -- that 
this could happen overnight -- does not exist at all. 
  [Bitzan] Do you believe that Saddam Husayn might again build 
a bomb? 
  [Blix] After many years of work, we reassessed Iraq's 
nuclear program. We know how the supply worked, where the 
materials and the know-how came from. We are certain that 
something like that will not happen again as long as the control 
continues. 
  [Bitzan] What were the reasons for the differences between 
the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] and North Korea? 
  [Blix] During inspections and analyses, we discovered, as 
early as in 1992, that more plutonium existed than was declared. 
Only a few additional grams, but also kilograms might be 
involved. We do not know. This is an unpleasant development and 
it strengthens our doubts regarding their statements. Our 
long-term problem is: How much plutonium do they possess beyond 
the quantities already declared, and where is it? 
  The current conflict has a different background. Our 
inspections were stopped at the most important site -- in the 
laboratory where used fuel rods are being separated and 
reprocessed. We were not allowed to carry out the required 
tests. 
  North Korea cited the fact that the inspectors demanded more 
than was stipulated in the agreement as one reason for its 
behavior. This is a completely unfounded accusation. At the 
moment there are no positive signs coming from Pyongyang. 
  [Bitzan] Will there be any sanctions? 
  [Blix] The initiative now lies with the UN Security Council. 
There is the firm wish among the Security Council to urge North 
Korea to allow the inspections. However, I do not think that 
there is currently a tendency toward sanctions. Nor do I 
believe that the United States is interested in a military 
escalation. It is making great efforts to explain that the 
"Patriots" are only of a defensive nature, and that they are 
only the response to the harsh language of the North. 
  [Bitzan] North Korea has repeatedly threatened to leave the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Has this danger now increased? 
  [Blix] North Korea has threatened to do so, but so far it 
has refrained from taking such a provocative step. However, 
this would not change the reality: The world wants to ensure 
that it cannot produce any nuclear weapons. The pressure on 
Pyongyang would be the same.

<F P=106> [IAEA "Press Release for the information media, not an </F>
official record": "The IAEA Reviews the Safety of the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant"] 
  [Text] An international expert safety assessment team 
organized by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] has 
concluded a visit to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to 
examine the current safety situation. This team carried out its 
mission during the period 7-17 March 1994. 
  The review team was composed of eight safety specialists 
from 
Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States 
along with two safety experts from the IAEA and one from the 
Group of 24 Nuclear Safety Coordination Secretariat in Brussels. 
The review was agreed to by the Ukrainian authorities after the 
Ukraine Government's October 1993 decision to postpone closure 
of the Chernobyl station which had been scheduled for the end of 
1993. Unit 1 which was placed into operation last week after a 
three week maintenance outage is currently operating at 80 
percent of its design power level of 1000 MW and Unit 3 at its 
design level of 1000 MW. 
  The team examined the plant safety design and a number of 
specific operational aspects. The review found numerous safety 
deficiencies in the two units of the plant which remain 
operational. Of particular concern are specific problems in the 
design of the first generation Unit 1, which have not been dealt 
with sufficiently. 
  In addition the experts identified a number of factors which 
together affect overall safe plant operation. Difficult working 
conditions and a serious continuing loss of highly skilled 
personnel are major problems. Limited procurement of up-to-date 
equipment also has a negative effect on safety. 
  A major problem is the technically confirmed accelerated 
deterioration of the shelter enclosing the destroyed unit 4 
reactor which, if it collapses, would have serious consequences. 
These findings were discussed at the end of the review in Kiev 
by the IAEA's Assistant Director General for nuclear safety, M. 
Rosen, with the President of the nuclear power operating 
organization (GCA), M.P. Umanetz. 
  The IAEA Director General, Dr. Hans Blix, has communicated 
on 
21 March to the President of Ukraine the conclusion that 
international levels of safety are not being met at Chernobyl at 
present. Considering the seriousness of the situation he has 
suggested that the Ukraine convene a meeting of interested 
countries parties to consider what actions could be taken to 
alleviate the situation; the IAEA would be ready to assist the 
Ukraine in arranging such a meeting in Vienna if so requested. 
  The President of Ukraine, Mr. Leonid Kravchuk, responded 
favourably to these suggestions in a reply dated 30 March 1994. 
Expressing thanks to the expert group for their work, he 
emphasized that the results of this work were considered by the 
Ukrainian Government to be a significant input to the objective 
evaluation of the safety level of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. 
It is anticipated that a meeting will accordingly be convened 
in Vienna in the second half of April.

  [Text] Geneva, March 30 (AFP) -- International mediators 
Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, briefing colleagues 
Wednesday [30 March] on developments in peace talks for former 
Yugoslavia, said they were pleased with progress but serious 
problems still lay ahead. 
  The main issues remain the scope of reconstruction needed to 
put the devastated region back on its feet and the maps that 
must still be drawn for peace accords reached this month under 
combined U.S.- Russian diplomatic pressure. 
  "The pattern is encouraging, but now the crucial thing is 
the 
map," European Union negotiator Owen told journalists after a 
meeting of the steering committee of the Geneva Peace Conference 
on former Yugoslavia, which groups around 30 countries and 
organisations. 
  Owen, just back from weekend talks in Belgrade, said Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic was showing flexibility. 
  Serbia wanted to reach agreement on an effective ceasefire, 
restoration of economic relations with neighbouring countries 
and the lifting of the international blockade against its rump 
state of Yugoslavia, he said. 
  The consultations came as the peace process received a boost 
after Bosnian Croats and Moslems signed a federation agreement 
in Washington on March 18 and Croatia and Serb separatists from 
the breakaway Krajina enclave signed a ceasefire accord early 
Wednesday. 
  "One of the most fundamental things is not to get much 
delay. 
This momentum is very, very important," Owen said at a press 
conference, praising the involvement of the two superpowers in 
the peace process. 
  The Bosnian Serbs are now considering whether they should 
join the Croat-Moslem entente, which they feared "could be an 
anti-Serb alliance," explained Owen. 
  U.S. special Envoy Charles Redman, who helped conclude that 
agreement, should visit the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale 
Wednesday or Thursday, said Owen, who thought the problem should 
be resolved jointly by the United Nations, the European Union, 
the United States and Russia. 
  Members of the Geneva steering committee, speaking about the 
mammoth task of rebuilding the war-ravaged region, said it was 
important that international aid efforts did not substitute for 
the efforts of the countries concerned, leaving them free to arm 
themselves once more. 
  The United States has made some aid promises but there is 
little doubt that the European Union will have to shoulder the 
main burden, members said.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The peacekeeping operation in Bosnia will continue 
despite a move by the United States to block additional forces, 
senior Government sources said today. 
  Washington -- which pays about 30 percent of all 
peacekeeping 
costs -- has been condemned for refusing to authorise the extra 
8,500 soldiers because of uncertainty of financial support from 
Congress. 
  Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said: 
"The Americans have no troops on the ground in Bosnia. It is a 
great pity that they are not willing to pay other countries to 
do what they are unwilling to do themselves." 
  The United States already owes more than 50 million pounds 
sterling for the Yugoslav operation, estimated at more than 600 
million pounds sterling a year. 
  It is being urged to approve a compromise text to renew the 
force for six months and authorise another 3,500 troops needed 
immediately. 
  U.S. envoys startled Security Council members last night by 
announcing that Washington needed another 30 days before it 
could consider a resolution it had helped negotiate. 
  More than half of the extra troops are already in Bosnia, 
including a 900-strong battalion group based on the Duke of 
Wellington's Regiment and 2,700 troops from Turkey. 
  And diplomats reminded U.S. officials that the new troops 
were to enforce ceasefires around Sarajevo and in central Bosnia 
that the United States had helped negotiate. "There is a 
momentum which has to be kept," Council President Jean-Bernard 
Merimee said. "If it is impossible to deploy new troops, there 
would be a risk of ceasefires being broken and agreements being 
jeopardised." 
  A British Government source said: "There is no question that 
the operation will not go ahead. The success of the 
peacekeeping operation has gone too far. There is no way it 
will be allowed to falter now." 
  Meanwhile, reports that Britain had offered to place 4,000 
troops on permanent standby for peacekeeping operations around 
the world were dismissed as "nonsense" by ministers. 
  British officials met UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali earlier this week to explain the kind of military 
expertise the UK could make available in future operations. 
"This was merely to give a flavour of what might be available," 
said a Whitehall source. "We are not going to see blue berets 
on Salisbury Plain and there will be no troops on permanent 
standby." 
  Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, supported by service 
chiefs, insists that troops will be selected to match the 
specific type of operation on a case-by-case basis rather than 
having earmarked peacekeeping forces.

  [Text] Vienna, March 30 (AFP) -- The Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe denounced Wednesday [30 March] human 
rights violations in the mainly Moslem region of Sandzak 
sandwiched between Serbia and its ally Montenegro. 
  A CSCE statement published here urged Belgrade to permit it 
to carry out "long-term" missions, banned by rump Yugoslavia 
last year. 
  The CSCE mentioned arbitrary arrests and detentions, police 
brutality and attempts to create ethnically cleansed zones in 
the rump federation of Serbia and Montenegro. 
  In July, Belgrade banned long-term CSCE missions to Sandzak, 
the majority Albanian province Kosovo and the province of 
Vojvodina, where there is a substantial population of ethnic 
Hungarians. 
  The missions' aim was to check minority rights were being 
respected and help prevent an extension of the war in 
ex-Yugoslavia.

further infantry company for Bosnia. This new company will be 
stationed in Tuzla, where the Nordic UN contingent is located. 
The Swedish UN soldiers in The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia will be moved to Bosnia, if they want to, but it might 
also be a case of renewed recruiting in Sweden. With today's 
decision, the number of Swedish soldiers in Bosnia will soon be 
just over 1,000.

<F P=106> [Mikael Holmstrom report: "Secret Group Shapes Baltic </F>
Policy"] 
  [Text] With the greatest secrecy Sweden regularly brings 
together an informal working group of diplomats from 10 Western 
countries to coordinate action vis-a-vis the Baltic states. 
  These activities go under the name of "The Ad Hoc Stockholm 
Group." In addition to Sweden, the United States, Canada, 
Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and 
the EU [European Union] Commission take part in the group's 
regular meetings. 
  The group was formed in the summer of 1992 after the CSCE 
meeting in Helsinki. 
  At the meeting the Russian troop retreat had been an 
internal 
Baltic bone of contention and had been resolved through the 
mediation of Prime Minister Carl Bildt. 
  How the Russian withdrawal is to be facilitated through 
support for retraining and homes for Russian officers has been 
just one of the topics on the group's agenda. 
  All questions with a Baltic connection are discussed -- for 
example, the position of the Russian-speaking population in the 
three Baltic states, economic and social development, and 
environmental problems. 
  When Prime Minister Carl Bildt declared on 17 November 1993 
that Sweden could not remain neutral in a crisis in which Russia 
threatened the Balts' freedom, his statement must been seen 
against the background of the informal responsibility which 
Sweden has assumed. 
  The message was that the Baltic region is not only Russia's 
"nearby foreign countries," it is also West Europe's "nearby 
foreign countries." From the Swedish viewpoint, Sweden has a 
very strong interest of its own in involving other Western 
countries in the Baltic region. 
  "The important thing is that through this group we can make 
sure that Sweden and Finland are not left alone with the Baltic 
states in a crisis. We have now built up a working network of 
those dealing with the Baltic region in various countries; they 
simply have to lift the telephone receiver to consult each 
other," a Swedish government source said. 
  The "interim" Stockholm group's meetings are held at least 
quarterly. Diplomats of head of department rank from the 
countries' foreign ministries take part in the meetings. Sweden 
is represented by the Foreign Ministry's political department 
and Carl Bildt's Cabinet Office. 
  The existence of the group has never been acknowledged in 
public. Representatives of the Swedish Government confirmed its 
existence only after SVENSKA DAGBLADET learned about the group 
through foreign sources. 
  The existence of the group has not even been common 
knowledge 
at the Foreign Ministry; from the beginning, the information was 
kept to a very limited circle. This high level of secrecy is in 
strong contrast to the government's policy of constantly 
stressing its active involvement on behalf of the Baltic region. 
  The government is unwilling to comment on the group: 
  "We do not want too much fuss about this," said one of 
SVENSKA DAGBLADET's sources. Another source explained why: 
  "This is work that is being done on a very informal basis. 
It is supposed to be consultative and to leave a free hand for 
initiatives, and not be anything more official. 
  ``Through the exchange of information, the group is a 
source of productive cooperation for the actions of the various 
countries: What talks people want to try to hold, how to 
proceed on certain issues, and how to act in various 
international forums.'' 
  While one person in the Cabinet Office has stated that the 
group is a purely consultative body and does not coordinate 
policy, another centrally placed source says that in practice 
the group has drawn up the tactics for Western action. 
  On the Swedish side, the view is that Moscow too takes a 
positive view of the Stockholm group, in part because of the 
interest in the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic states. 
  "On the Russian side too the Swedish involvement is viewed 
as 
natural. We are not interested in pursuing a provocative 
policy. Our interest is to make a contribution to stability in 
our immediate environs," is the summary of one Swede with a 
knowledge of the group's work. 
  The Stockholm group also functions as a complement to the 
talks Carl Bildt has with the heads of state and government of 
other countries. 
  One example of this is his contacts with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton over the Russian troop retreat from Latvia. 
  In February, the leaders of all eight parties in the Latvian 
parliament visited Washington and were received at the very 
highest level. This was done to persuade the Latvians to accept 
a U.S. compromise on the Russian troop retreat and on the 
Russian radar station in Skrunda (as they subsequently did). 
  The Latvians traveled home through Stockholm. At the Swedish 
Government's information briefing for the mass media on 3 
February, no mention was made of the fact that Assistant Under 
Secretary Lars Freden, the prime minister's expert on the Baltic 
region, had accompanied the Latvians to Washington at the 
invitation of the United States. 
  Neither was there mention on that occasion of the fact that 
the Latvians used their stopover in Sweden to discuss their 
situation with 10 Western diplomats from the Stockholm group.
