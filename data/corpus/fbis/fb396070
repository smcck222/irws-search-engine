(6717 0013 0948): "Numerous Alcoholic Beverage Production and 
Sales Problems"] 
  [Text] Heilongjiang is a major alcoholic beverage producing 
and selling province. There presently are 88 national 
distilleries and 90 breweries in the province and annual 
production of spirits and beer is nearly 1 million tons. Taxes 
and profits realized from spirits and beer in addition to wine 
and state commercial alcoholic beverage sales in recent years 
have exceeded 700 million yuan, making up an important part of 
provincial revenue. 
  But these reporters understand from the people concerned 
that 
in recent years, Heilongjiang's alcoholic beverage production 
and sales both have been in a rather chaotic state, not only 
causing serious erosion of revenue, but more directly 
endangering consumers' physical health. 
  Alcoholic beverage production is out of overall control. 
Based on calculations of current production capability, 
throughout the province state enterprise production of spirits 
is 100,000 tons greater than sales and production of beer in 
200,000 tons greater than sales. In some state enterprises, 
production capacity is idle and with results still not fully 
brought into play, small individual distilleries have grown 
incrementally. According to incomplete statistics, in 1991 there 
were 879 small distilleries throughout the province, and this 
year it has already reached 2,500. According to a survey, the 
vast majority of small distilleries do not meet standard 
production conditions. They do not have specialized technicians 
and they do not have testing equipment. Some even sell diluted 
industrial alcohol. What causes extremely serious consequences 
is that fatal poisonings continue to occur. In March 1993, a 
farmer, Bu Sulong [0592 4790 7893], in Songjiang village, 
Songjiang township on the outskirts of Jiamusi without any 
license operated a small private distillery, used adulterated 
industrial alcohol diluted with unboiled water to make spirits 
in bulk, and peddled 1,500 kilograms to thirteen sales points in 
that locality, poisoning five people to death, paralyzing three 
people, and blinding three people in both eyes. An inordinate 
amount of poisonings also occurred in Bin county last year 
causing injury and death. Because of their limited technology, 
small distilleries' grain consumption is generally twice that of 
state distilleries. According to statistics, in this province 
alone, 150 million kilograms of grain is wasted. 
  According to surveys, the existence of small distilleries 
depends mainly on tax loopholes. Experts reveal that if they 
paid 10 percent taxes, all small distilleries would lose money. 
The current state distillery tax is levied at 35 percent. Based 
on this calculation, every year throughout the province taxes 
evaded by small distilleries reach 50 million yuan or more. 
  The alcoholic beverage sales market is out of control. Since 
the circulation system has been reformed and the state 
commercial monopoly has been broken, channels for circulating 
alcoholic beverages have increased and a brisk market has 
flourished. But at the same time it has brought some problems. 
The first is that falsely labeled alcoholic beverages have run 
rampant. In 1992 alone, throughout the province special 
alcoholic beverage sales control organizations confiscated more 
than 260,000 bottles of fake Maotai and fake Wuliang. 
  The second is that low-grade spirits diluted with ethyl 
alcohol are flooding the market. In 1992 throughout the 
province, special alcoholic beverage sales control organizations 
confiscated more than 200,000 kilograms of low-grade alcoholic 
beverages made by individuals using ethyl alcohol diluted with 
unboiled water, and in 1993 they confiscated more than 300,000 
kilograms. 
  Experts believe that the key to turning around the chaotic 
situation in the production and sale of alcoholic beverages is 
in learning from other provinces and augmenting special 
alcoholic beverage sales controls and speeding up special sales 
legislation for alcoholic beverages.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Liu Shuang (0491 3642): "Writings Are </F>
Meant To Be Eternal, But Merchants Are Playing Critic Today: 
1993--An Unpoetic Year for Writers?"] 
  [Text] 1993 was an exciting year for Chinese 
scholars. Looking back at the literary world of 1993, amid the 
mishmash of discussions, one voice kept saying, the year of 1993 
was flooded by waves of commercialism; the literary world was 
"unpoetic." Some critics said that behind the writers' frantic 
rush to get into the market were merchants deliberately playing 
up and at the same time obstructing the literary world. Thus the 
legacy of 1993 is a less-than-well-developed literary market in 
1994. Others believe that "unpoetic" is a necessary loss. No 
matter what everybody is saying, no scholar can forget the 
emotions of 1993, even less can he or she stop mulling and 
pondering over and recalling and reviewing that year. 
<H5>  I. Literature and Publication: A Romantic Dream Revisited </H5>
  Our research trailed behind; nobody predicted its arrival: 
Literature seems to be on the rise again. In taking big strides 
toward the market, scholars and writers have broken free from 
their self-love, self-pity, and their penchant to blame god and 
man--blame everyone but themselves, and they are actively and 
wholeheartedly joining hands with the publishers, who in turn 
have come to realize that perhaps literature is the cardiotonic 
that can save them. 
  The popularity of Sao Tu is a very typical 
example. The author, Lao Cun [5071 2625], whose real name is Cai 
Tongkai [5591 6639 2818], is a middle-aged man living in Beijing 
without proper household registration. He was very poor. Many 
publishing houses' editors may have forgotten, but several years 
ago, a young writer from a village in Shaanxi Province was 
clutching his novel and knocking on doors, seeking help, but 
everybody ignored him, because there were many other young and 
middle-aged writers who were afflicted with the same "writer's 
syndrome." 
  Cai Tongkai's lucky year was 1993. He was discovered--just 
like a movie star--by a book distributor. Sao Tu 
became the first Chinese novel to be published by the CHINESE 
LITERATURE PUBLISHING HOUSE. Prior to that, the publisher was a 
part of the FOREIGN LANGUAGE PUBLISHING HOUSE. They took a 
chance with the book but owed its success to the management of a 
very capable distributor. Overnight, Sao Tu filled 
the main streets and the back alleys. Those in the business 
estimate that 60-70,000 copies have been printed. Sometimes the 
book is put alongside serious biographies in the book stalls, 
showing a new publication order for 1993. Lao Cun's life as a 
laborer is over. He said he wanted to be a full-time writer from 
now on. 
  A fine example has boundless power. One set of books or even 
a single book can save a publishing house. At the end of 1993, 
book stalls were filled with literary smoke from big guns like 
Floating City [Fu Cheng] (by Liang Xiaosheng [2733 
2556 5116]); Blue City [Lan Cheng] (SPRING BREEZE 
LITERARY PUBLISHING HOUSE); Rainless City [Wuyu 
Zhicheng] (by Tie Ning [6993 0413]); Bitter World [Ku 
Jie] (by Hung Feng [3163 1496]); Naked Snow [Luo Xue] 
(by Cong Weixi [0654 4850 3556].) These books are everywhere; 
circulars are being handed out. Many works are by once-famous 
writers whom we have not heard from in a while. 
  Here we cannot overlook the effects of the "invasion of the 
east by the Shaanxi army" on literature and publication in 1993. 
The "invasion" began early in the year and reached its peak in 
midsummer. 
  People are beginning to refine their market choices. The 
development of the book market follows its own laws. Upon 
reaching saturation, all reading materials tend to show some 
inertia, and at that time anything that is new and vigorous will 
show vitality. That was how things took a turn for the better 
for literature in 1993. People with some education were fed up 
with seedy, pirated books and were losing their "appetite," 
because most reading materials had lost much of their spiritual 
content and there was nothing there to quench the readers' 
thirst. An ordinary worker-type young man bought a half-decent 
novel and said to his friends, "This stuff is pretty 
meaningless." 
  In refining their tastes, people have also discovered that 
the market can be made and led. Works that are currently popular 
have made use of "packaging" to help them become a market 
success. If the successful "packaging" of the "invasion of the 
east by the Shaanxi army" had been unintentional, the massive 
advertisement and publicity of those that came later were 
deliberate. 
  On 28 September of last year, writer Zhou Hong [0719 3163] 
signed a contract and "sold" himself to CHINESE YOUTH PUBLISHING 
HOUSE. That was the first time in decades a publisher "bought 
up" a writer and "packaged" him. It made quite a stir in media 
circles. It has been four months since he "sold" himself on a 
3-year contract. What is the result of the market test? Both 
Zhou Hong and his publisher say that "it is very sweet," because 
the first set of books he sold after "selling himself," 
Sincere Advice on Life [Rensheng Zhonggao] was bought 
up by the Xinhua Bookstore for exclusive sales. Zhou Hong's top 
writer, Zhou Chengyi [0719 2429 5030], recently told this 
reporter that 110,000 copies of one book and 55,000 copies of 
two other books in the set had been printed. That made a total 
of 220,000 copies. In other words, CHINESE YOUTH PUBLISHING 
HOUSE never had to take any risk in this venture which was a 
first of its kind in China's publishing circles. It was a 
filling and comfortable meal. 
  Didn't we say we wanted to get rid of the old publication 
system? Didn't we say we wanted to encourage the publishers to 
change from the production mode to the production-management 
mode? We cannot draw any conclusion yet. From the efficiency 
point of view, of course everything is perfect. Despite the ban 
on the buying and selling of book titles, and in the face of a 
general recession, the "purchase" of Zhou Hong has made money 
for the publisher and has made the writer rich too. Everybody is 
happy. But from the point of even higher expectations, what we 
have today is still the same old system, unless CHINESE YOUTH 
PUBLISHING HOUSE can come up with another new move or new 
gimmick this year. 
  At the signing ceremony, a reporter asked how much Zhou Hong 
was getting. He never gave a straight answer, which led some 
people to wonder whether the publisher was paying him by the 
number of prints per book. That in essence would mean that Zhou 
was only "selling books" and that "selling himself" was but a 
publicity stunt to shock people. No matter what people say, the 
CHINESE YOUTH PUBLISHING HOUSE's buying and packaging of writers 
does have a positive effect on people out to explore China's 
best-seller mechanisms. 
  Can literature be "sold" and writers be "bought"? Debates 
raged throughout 1993. What is gratifying is that while 
everybody "sat down to talk" it has not kept them from "taking 
action." From the literature point of view, Zhou Hong is not a 
pure literary writer and therefore cannot represent the pure 
literary writers in accepting the market's tests. Zhou Hong's 
work is but "cultural fast food," with young men taking part in 
division of labor. There is no need for strong artistic 
character, but their works meet a best-seller's need for general 
appeal. In exploring the beginning stage, doing the easy things 
first before tackling the tough problems is a wise move. 
  What place does pure literature have in the market? The 
lesson was not dealt with in 1993. In Guangzhou, young critic 
Wang Gan [3769 1631] brought up the concept of "literature is 
not for sale." He said literary works are very susceptible to 
corruption by "commercialization" and therefore some people must 
escape from this humiliating "marriage" system. In the south 
where this concept was invented, price competition for 
manuscripts is raging like wildfire. Several large, so-called 
prima donna pure literary journals, such as SHIYUE, DANGDAI, 
SHOUHUO, HUACHENG, and ZHONGSHAN, are still tenaciously 
defending literature's spiritual fortress despite "repeated 
defeats," but not all of them are doing well. Some are selling 
as many as 100,000 copies while others are selling only a few 
thousand copies. At one time, there was news that SHOUHUO was in 
financial trouble and would not stay in business for long. 
Shanghai's writers were very much saddened. But SHIYUE's deputy 
editor-in-chief, Tian Zhenying [3944 3791 4481], said the 
magazine's subscription rate has actually gone up 3 percent. How 
do the readers choose what kind of pure literature they want? 
That indeed is a question for the experts to explore. 
<H5>  II. "Suicide" or "Murder": A Writer's Choice </H5>
  Some critics have compared Zhou Hong's signing the contract 
to "sell" himself to a writer committing "suicide," killing his 
own artistry and ideal. They also compare writers who are being 
told what to do by middlemen to murder victims. There were many 
examples of this kind in 1993. "Suicide" and "murder" differ 
only in the way sales are being made. When it comes to choosing 
a marketing format, writers are showing more courage than ever 
before. 
  The person most aggressive in trying new methods is Chen 
Jiangong [7115 1696 0501]. On 6 December last year, people 
noticed an eye-catching, front-page advertisement in BEIJING 
WANBAO: Buyer of TV or movie adaptation rights to Chen 
Jiangong's novelette Qian Ke sought. The company that 
planned this whole thing for Chen Jiangong and acted as his 
agent was Beijing's (?Aideer) Information and Consultation 
Company. Reportedly, this company handles public relations and 
provides investment and consultation services; it once sponsored 
the capital writers and reporters' "pen-exchanging" conference. 
Because the key managers of the company are former writers, it 
has kept close ties with those in literary circles. They want to 
take advantage of their speciality to launch a new business to 
act as middleman and agent for writers, scholars, and artists. 
Soliciting buyers for the adaptation right to Chen Jiangong's 
Qian Ke was a way to test the waters. 
  This reporter recently visited the company and learned that 
a 
month has gone by and three buyers have entered the negotiation 
stage. Aideer [name as transliterated] Company will follow 
international practices and will get a percentage as commission 
in the deal. Following in Jiangong's footsteps is folk singer Hu 
Songhua [7579 2646 5478] who also has plans to work with Aideer. 
The company may become the agent for his made-for-TV art film, 
Changge Wanlihang. When the time comes, much will be 
done to package that product too. 
  An Aideer [name as transliterated] Company manager told this 
reporter that writer's agents would have surfaced in China 
sooner or later. With the service of intermediaries or personal 
agents, the writers can rise above the interference of business 
matters, escape from their own impulses, and immerse themselves 
in their creative work. 
  In fact, at the end of 1992, CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY had 
reported 
"the opening of the first press agency in the mainland." Xian's 
Chinese Book Agency Service Department hung up its shingle at 
the end of 1992. Its main business should have started in 1993, 
but unfortunately, the Shaanxi army had moved east: all the 
popular works had gone to Beijing. Reportedly the service 
department is a paid service organization set up by the Shaanxi 
Book Critic's Association. Its business scope includes 
recommending topics and print-worthy manuscripts to domestic and 
overseas publishers; soliciting contributions on behalf of 
publishing units; acting as agent for a specific work or on a 
retainer basis for writers at home and abroad; handling 
publication and distribution matters as requested by the 
writers. They make money mainly by charging the writers a 
10-yuan handling fee plus 10-20 percent commission on the 
writer's remuneration for each book published. 
  Shanghai has a writer's publishing agency too. Its business 
also includes finding enterprises to sponsor writers who have no 
money to get their books published. Everybody has also noticed 
the potential market for intermediaries who handle manuscripts. 
Their existence is premised upon the maturity of the cultural 
market. 
  It has entered the minds of some literary writers of actual 
events to hire personal agents too. A certain top writer of a 
major newspaper is often besieged by manuscript seekers. He is 
totally confused about the names of newspapers and magazines, 
the different topics, and the deadlines for various manuscripts; 
he cannot remember who is who. In particular, a southern 
magazine once sent two woman editors on separate occasions. He 
cannot remember the name of the better-looking one. 
  Meanwhile, another top writer has been working happily with 
a 
retired editor who is very conscientious and responsible and 
sends the writer's manuscripts in all directions so that every 
manuscript seeker gets what he wants. In effect the retired 
editor has become an agent. 
  In addition to the need for agents, writers and scholars 
have 
discovered the importance of getting organized in order to keep 
up with the rhythm and the order of large industrial production. 
There are two approaches to getting organized: First, people who 
share the same goal use their names to create acronyms such as 
"Xue Mei Li" and "Zhou Hong"; in Wuhan, there is even a "Gong Bo 
Hou." At one time, Wuhan was considered the second channel in 
the wholesale gathering and distribution of books and magazines 
and often found itself unwilling to lag behind the bustling 
Beijing publishing circles. "Gong Bo Hou's" full-length book set 
The Devil [Mogui] ("Mogui Liansanjue," "Mogui 
Xiesantuan," "Mogui Nuerguo," and "Mogui 
Yehuchan") hit the market in October of last year. This 
reporter has learned that "Gong Bo Hou" had claimed that all of 
their work would be published exclusively by CHANGJIANG LITERARY 
PUBLISHING HOUSE before October 1996. From the book titles, one 
can tell that they are targeting a different group of readers 
than those targeted by Zhou Hong and others. 
  Another form of organization is the writer's bureau and 
creative center. In addition to the well-known "Haima," the 
Changan Movie and Television Script Writing Center in the 
northwest is another major movie and TV script-writing center 
today. Its building-block format is well-known to the public. 
The "Three Sisters" writer's bureau, known for its mastery in 
all areas from music, chess, literature, to painting has also 
added elegance and style to the 1993 literary world. Wang Fei 
[3769 5481] and his sisters are up-and-coming members of the 
capital's media circles. Reportedly, civilian-run bureaus 
comprising of famous writers have established themselves in 
Beijing and somewhere in Fujian. Their members include reporters 
and writers who can be commissioned to write books and 
manuscripts, biographies for enterprises and famous personages, 
and any other kind of writing. They remind us of the early kind 
of men-of-letter who wrote marriage contracts, land leases, and 
petitions and legal papers. But there has been no media report 
on how well these bureaus are faring. 
  We had a huge contingent of writers and scholars last year. 
While some writers laid low, others were wildly popular. Cao 
Guilin [2580 2710 2651] was indeed a household name in 1993, but 
the media have disclosed the dark side of the writer's morals, 
and the public was bewildered. 
  This article has no intention of getting entangled in what 
is 
true or false and has no intention of making moral judgments 
here. We are only interested in a trend in the 1993 literary 
world, and that is, how the successful ones were crowned kings 
while the defeated became bandits. People no longer care if 
there is a split between the writer's work and his character; 
they no longer care about the tempering and sublimation of the 
scholar's character. Is this corruption of the contingent of 
creative writers, or is this progress? As for the critics who 
lament that "we hear no ancient sage's cry in the wilderness," 
it is even more a case of the idealists putting unrealistic 
demands on the writers. 
  The writers' loss of esteem is far less poetic than their 
"suicide" or "murder." People no longer cherish the title, 
"writer"; even the scholars are ashamed of themselves. 
<H5>  III. A Virus in Publishing Circles: Piracy and Anti-Piracy </H5>
  Woman writer Tie Ning called her chief editor long-distance 
from Shejiazhuang telling him that just a month after her 
full-length novel, "Rainless City" hit the market, pirated 
copies were found in Shejiazhuang, Baoding, and other 
localities. Tie Ning angrily described the crude quality of the 
pirated copies which were full of mistakes. Her picture on the 
cover was ghastly. 
  SPRING BREEZE LITERARY PULISHING HOUSE editor, An Boshun 
[1344 3134 5293], told this reporter, "This is totally 
unexpected." "Rainless City" was the second book marketed under 
the series Cloth Tiger [Bu Laohu]. It appeared that 
the pirated copies had gained a substantial market share. 
Pirated copies of the first book in the Cloth Tiger 
series, Bitter World (by Hung Feng), have also been 
spotted. On hearing the news of piracy everywhere, An Bochun is 
like someone whose home has just been burglarized. He is 
struggling in a "bitter world." 
  "Publishers want their books to sell well. But hot-selling 
books are doomed to be victimized by piracy," said the chief 
editor. "A good book is not easy to come by. Our bureau worked 
very hard to come up with the Cloth Tiger series. We 
first tried to reach a consensus with 10 writers, and from 
selecting the topics to packaging and advertising the products 
and so on, we have put in a lot of work. We have even registered 
the name and logo, Cloth Tiger, as our trademark. Our 
intention was to create a famous name in publishing circles and 
use it to combat the seedy publications market. This was 
something nobody had ever done before in publishing circles. But 
pirates of books do not pay taxes; they do not pay for the 
manuscripts. All they put in is some money for the paper and 
ink. What they are after is huge profit." 
  According to the editor, when Bitter World and 
Rainless City were still in the press, someone went 
to the printing shop to bribe a worker and went to the bureau to 
bribe the editor to try to get hold of a duplicate copy or 
sample. Someone even had the nerve to go straight to the 
editor's home and bargain with him: "Work with us and we will 
give you a cut of the profit. Other people pirate your books and 
you don't even get a penny; you won't even know who did it." 
  It is learned that to track down the pirates, the news 
publishing department, the department of industry and commerce, 
and the public security department often must work together, and 
investigating cases across provincial, city, and regional 
boundaries is very difficult. Individual book dealers are a 
mysterious bunch; pirates are even harder to track down. They 
often use some small printing shops to reprint books illegally; 
they make a hit and clear out of the area immediately. The 
printing of pirated books often help revive the small, 
hard-pressed printers, and once the workers are paid their 
bonuses, local protectionism becomes an obstacle blocking any 
investigative effort. Even if the violators are apprehended, 
they are often fined and released. To them, the fine is nothing 
compared to the exorbitant profits they can make, but to the 
publishers, the human and material resources spent far exceed 
any compensation. This is one of the reasons the publishers feel 
helpless against piracy. 
  Most book pirates are individual dealers; some are former 
editors who have left the publishing circles; a handful are 
members of publishing houses stealing from their own company. Of 
course if these people gang up, they can be a force to be 
reckoned with. The contingent of pirates is becoming 
increasingly specialized. They respond very quickly, assess the 
market accurately, and can anticipate the publishers' every 
move. It normally takes only a few days to pirate a book. They 
use deep discounts and high profit to squeeze the publishers out 
of the retail network. Those in the business estimate that for a 
relatively large law case of speculation and profiteering that 
generates 200,000 yuan in profit, one only needs to make 20,000 
copies to earn back the money. Some book dealers say that they 
will not even bother with volumes of less than 100,000 copies. 
According to the editor of BEIJING PUBLISHING HOUSE, 11 
different counterfeit versions of a best-seller they had 
published have been discovered; each version had at least 20,000 
copies. Some books have been discontinued by the publishers, but 
they are still available in the market. Some pirates use 
camera-technique to make copies, and they look almost real. 
However, most copies are of very poor quality. A reader sent an 
angry letter to BEIJING PUBLISHING HOUSE because the book he 
bought was full of misprints and mistakes. He even sought 
100,000 yuan in proofreading fee and threatened to go to the 
Consumer Protection Agency. The publisher was at a loss for 
words; they sent him an authentic copy to avoid the consequences. 
  Recently this reporter obtained the latest news from the 
PARTY LITERATURE PUBLISHING HOUSE that lawyers have been 
retained to take legal action against those who pirated Mao 
Mao's [3029 3029] My Father Deng Xiaoping. This 
probably is the most straight-forward legal case in publishing 
circles. The book's chief editor, Zhou Zhixing [0719 1807 5281], 
told this reporter that after My Father, Deng 
Xiaoping hit the market, pirated copies soon appeared in 
Chengdu, Wuhan, Changsha, Jinan and other cities. The 
Serious Warning put out by the PARTY LITERATURE 
PUBLISHING HOUSE on the front page of XINWEN CHUBAN BAO on 8 
November of last year pointed out that book pirating has ruined 
the reputation of the publisher and has hurt its profit and that 
the publisher has reserved the right to prosecute those engaging 
in piracy and seek compensation for economic losses. Awards were 
offered for leads, and anyone who could provide specific 
information on the case would be awarded 10,000 yuan by the 
publisher. Zhou Zhixing said the quality of the pirated copies 
was very poor, and erroneous wording has produced adverse 
political fallout. Currently, the piracy activities in Wuhan are 
being investigated by local relevant departments; most of the 
10,000 copies uncovered so far have been turned into pulp. 
Pirating in Shandong is being investigated by the pertinent 
department there. 
  Lawyers Zhang Yongyi [1728 3057 1355] and Cao Zhixin [2580 
1807 2450] of Beijing's Dadi Law Firm have been retained by the 
PARTY LITERATURE PUBLISHING HOUSE. Despite the increasingly 
rampant acts of piracy, the lawyers believe that the relevant 
laws and regulations governing the printing industry as 
promulgated by the state are detailed and specific, and if the 
industry would follow the state's laws and regulations strictly, 
they can cut off the crime of piracy at the first link. For 
example, when the pirates commission the printing job and when 
they pick up the books, they always pay cash; all necessary 
documents can be forged, and when one tries to find the person 
who commissioned the work, it is like looking for a needle in a 
haystack. If the printing shop would closely check the identity 
of the person commissioning the work, it would facilitate later 
investigations and in turn block the pirate's way out. 
  When the editor of SPRING BREEZE LITERARY PUBLISHING HOUSE 
heard the above news, he smiled sadly and said, "If they dare 
pirate that book, what wouldn't they steal?" 
  As swords clash in the battle between piracy and 
anti-piracy, 
people can distinctly hear the jingling of pennies. The sound 
can be heard ringing loud and clear on many days throughout 1993. 
  The loss of the sense of poetry is the loss of morality and 
the loss of order. 
  The sense of poetry cannot be restored by artificial means 
or 
by sheer will. Society nevertheless is evolving toward 
civilization and wealth. The people's overall spiritual fatigue 
is but a transition; literature will eventually occupy a good 
place. We must remain calm and collected. 
  Senior editor Tian Zhenying has enthusiastic praise for a 
group of young people. She told the reporter that 20-some young 
writers, including Liu Zhenyun [0491 7201 7189], Mo Yan [5459 
6056], Chen Jiangong, Mu Guozheng [3018 0948 2398], Hua Shumin 
[5478 3219 2404], and Xu Mouqing [6079 6180 3237] are working 
with a publisher of pure literature on a trial basis to create a 
kind of "new experimental novels." Regardless of success or 
failure, their spirit is commendable. Despite the predicament 
pure literary publications are facing, these people are not 
laying blame nor complaining nor standing by doing nothing; 
instead they are stepping out to lend support to the 
publications and are trying diligently and seriously to 
accomplish something as they explore pure literary and artistic 
creations. It is most gratifying to find young people who are 
without sectarian biases and who are open-minded. 
  Do the senior editor's words mean that after the shakeup in 
1993, the literary world will become more mature? 
  The beginning of the year is a time when people try to catch 
their breath. To find out what 1994 will be like, one must wait 
till spring.

<F P=106> [Article by Chen Chao, affiliated with the History Institute </F>
of the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences: "The Early Spread of 
Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism in Xinjiang and Yang Zengxin's 
Responses"--edited by Qi Qingshun] 
  [Text] Early this 
century Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism were very active 
internationally, and Xinjiang was also affected directly or 
indirectly. At the time the infiltration of Pan-Islamism and 
Pan-Turkism into Xinjiang had already aroused vigilance on the 
part of Yang Zengxin, then governor and military commander of 
Xinjiang Province. He regarded the infiltration as a potential 
threat to stability in Xinjiang, and adopted preventive, 
restrictive, and crackdown measures, which played some role in 
maintaining social stability in Xinjiang. 
<H6>  I </H6>
  Pan-Islamism is also translated as Greater Islamism, and was 
founded by Jamal al-Din al-Afghani. During the middle of last 
century, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani began to have Pan-Islamic 
ideas. He advocated uniting believers of Islam, reinvigorating 
Islam, and resisting Western colonialism's influence on the 
politics, economics, and culture of the Islamic countries. At 
the time such ideas had some progressive role to play in 
opposing the colonialist aggression carried out by Western 
powers. However, such supranational, suprastate, and supraclass 
narrow religious views were later used by feudal autocratic and 
imperialist forces as their ideological tools for carrying out 
aggression in the relevant regions. 
  The most devoted promoter of Pan-Islamism was Abdul Hamid II 
of the Ottoman Empire (the predecessor of the Republic of Turkey 
and commonly called Ottoman Turkey). He came to power through a 
coup in 1876. As the head of government he proclaimed himself 
"sultan," and as a religious leader he proclaimed himself 
"caliph," practicing theocratic feudal rule. But the size of his 
realm was no longer comparable to that in the past. The purpose 
of his effort to promote Pan-Islamism was to try to bring 
believers of Islam all over the world under the rule of the 
sultan and caliph of the Ottoman Empire, so as to relive the 
historical experience of the Ottoman Empire of the past which 
had stretched across the three continents of Europe, Asia, and 
Africa. 
  Pan-Turkism has often been mistranslated as the doctrine of 
Greater Turkey. The ancestor of Turkey was a Turkic tribe which 
moved westward during the Middle Ages; the chief of that tribe 
was Osman. The Osmani Turks moved from Central Asia to Western 
Asia, and gradually became the Turkish nation through 
assimilating local peoples. Pan-Turkism advocated that Turkey 
unite all turkic-speaking peoples, that is, to establish a great 
Turkic empire headed by Turkey, stretching from the Bosporus to 
the Altay mountains, or even from the Mediterranean to the 
Pacific Ocean; obviously a large part of China's territory, 
including Xinjiang, would be included. Pan-Turkism was the same 
as Pan-Islamism, and there was no difference in essence between 
the two. The aim of Pan-Turkism was also to relive the 
experience of the Ottoman Empire of the past. 
  Ideas of Pan-Turkism originated among the Turkic-speaking 
Tatars in tsarist Russia. Ismail Gasprinski was an early 
representative figure of the effort to propagate Pan-Turkism. He 
founded JOURNAL OF TURKMENISTAN in the Crimea in 1878 and 
founded the journal TERCUMAN in 1883, calling on Turkic-speaking 
peoples to get united. Each edition of that journal had 
5,000-6,000 copies, some of which were brought from Central Asia 
to the Xinjiang region. 
  By early this century propagating Pan-Islamism and 
Pan-Turkism had become an important component of the means used 
in imperialist aggression. There were then as many as over 200 
publications propagating those ideas. In 1909 the Committee of 
Union and Progress of Turkey (called the Young Turks by the 
Europeans) overthrew Hamid II and organized a new government. 
Politically that government advocated constitutional monarchy, 
and ideologically it made energetic efforts to promote 
Pan-Turkism, allowing Pan-Turkic organizations to operate 
openly. After the October Revolution many Pan-Turkic activists 
infiltrated the Central Asian region of the Soviet Union. They 
distributed tens of thousands of propaganda pamphlets, smuggled 
firearms into the region, and tried to incite the 
Turkic-speaking peoples to create disturbances; they were also 
already having a impact on China's northwestern border 
region--Xinjiang. 
<H6>  II </H6>
  Because of geographical, ethnic, and religious factors, 
Xinjiang was all along coveted by Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic 
forces around the world. 
  Shakhmatov and Kireyev, scholars of the Soviet Union, would 
argue: Yakub Beg who invaded Xinjiang in 1865 pursued an 
"adventurous, naked policy of Greater Islamism," and established 
a "feudal khanate."[.sup]1[/] This view warrants debate. In 
1865 Pan-Islamism was in its infant stage. It was in the 1890s 
that Pan-Islamism came to be given attention and exploited by 
Hamid II, sultan of Ottoman Turkey. However by that time Yakub 
Beg and his aggressor regime had already been buried by the 
Chinese people. It should be said that Yakub Beg exploited Islam 
in invading Xinjiang but did not start the effort to promote 
Pan-Islamism (i.e., Greater Islamism). 
  Based on the historical data now available, generally it can 
be argued: During the period from the late 19th century to the 
early 20th century, ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism began 
to be propagated in Xinjiang. The main manifestation was that 
Gasprinski's Pan-Turkic journal TERCUMAN had reached Xinjiang. 
In 1908 Maolamusha Sailami [3029 2139 2607 3097 6357 2139 4717] 
of Baicheng, Xinjiang, changed the title of his book A HISTORY 
OF ANNING into A HISTORY OF HAMID (the Chinese translation was 
YIMIDE SHI (A HISTORY OF YIMIDE) or HAIMIDE SHI (A HISTORY OF 
HAIMIDE). He wrote in the preface: Hamid II is the leader and 
great protector of all Muslims. As shown here, Pan-Islamism had 
already had some influence on people of the religious community 
in Xinjiang, but cannot be said to have already produced harmful 
effects on society. It was during the early years of the 
republic after the 1911 Revolution that harmful effects on 
social safety in Xinjiang began to be produced. 
  When Yang Zengxin ruled Xinjiang in the early years of the 
republic, ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism infiltrated 
Xinjiang in a substantial manner. The infiltration was 
manifested in the following several ways: 
  1. Running schools. Under the flag of having a new kind of 
school, efforts were made to instill ideas of Pan-islamism and 
Pan-Turkism into the minds of adolescents. Ahmad Kamal, a 
Turkish subject, run a school in southern Xinjiang, and Masud 
Sabri, who had returned home after studying in Turkey, run a 
school in Ili. These were two obvious examples. 
  In March 1914 Ahmad Kamal, 25 years old at the time, came to 
Xinjiang on a tourist visa. When teaching at the Ottoman Unity 
Force School in Istanbul, Turkey, two years earlier, he had got 
acquainted with members of the Committee of Union and Progress, 
Fuat Koprulu, Ziya Gokalp, Mehmed Talat, and others, who were 
all active promoters of Pan-Turkism. For instance, Ziya Gokalp 
later published the book Turkculugun Esaslam (The 
Principles of Turkism). Mehmed Talat was a leader of the 
Committee of Union and Progress. He led a secret organization, 
the task of which was to propagate Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism 
outside Turkey. 
  Toward the end of 1913, during their pilgrimage journey to 
Mecca some hajjis from Xinjiang came to Istanbul, Turkey, 
travelling in a roundabout fashion, and were received by Mehmed 
Talat. At that time a member of the wealthy Husayn Bay family of 
Artush, Xinjiang, proposed to hire Turkish teachers to teach in 
Xinjiang, so as to improve the cultural and scientific knowledge 
of Uighur adolescents. Mehmed Talat immediately realized that 
this was a wonderful opportunity to have ideas of Pan-Islamism 
and Pan-Turkism infiltrate Xinjiang of China; so he agreed to 
the proposal right away and sent Ahmad Kamal to Xinjiang. When 
Ahmad Kamal arrived in Artush around mid-February after leaving 
Istanbul, he was received by Husayn Bay and Baha al-Din. 
According to Buguozhai Wendu [The Correspondence of Yang 
Zengxin] by Yang Zengxin, Bawuding [1572 0063 0002] and 
Yiming'aili [5902 2494 5337 6849] of the local gentry hired 
Ahmad as a teacher at Small Artush Village. The school was 
divided into two or three parts which were situated in Beijie 
and Genggongci. The scripture was the main subject being taught, 
while such subjects as medicine and arithmetics were also 
taught. In addition, according to Burhan: Baodingbayi [0545 0002 
1572 0181], a wealthy businessman in Kashi hired Ahmad Kamal 
from Turkey as a teacher, and built a school in Artush, which 
was to exclusively engage in propagating Pan-Islamism and 
Pan-Turkism.[.sup]2[/] 
  On 19 April 1914 Ahmad Kamal opened a normal school in 
Artush 
with three classes, mainly admitting local elementary school 
leavers at the age of 15 or older, including some children from 
wealthy families. There was also a special class which admitted 
exclusively those students who had learned some Arabic and 
Persian from imams. In addition to religion courses there were 
also history, geography, art, and gymnastics courses. Teaching 
materials consisted entirely of translations of Turkish 
textbooks, and printing machines transported here from Istanbul 
were used to print them. The journal ULU DIN was also printed. 
  Ahmad Kamal forced the school to accept the sultan of 
Ottoman 
Turkey as the leader and to regard the caliph of Ottoman Turkey 
as the spiritual father, and only allowed students to sing 
Turkish songs.[.sup]3[/] He used the school as a position in 
the battle of propagating ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, 
and spread ideological poisons harmful to China and the Chinese 
nation with regard to state and national identity, thereby 
poisoning the adolescents. 
  Masud Sabri was from Ili, Xinjiang, and was born to a 
wealthy 
family in 1887. In 1904 he went to Ottoman Turkey to study 
medicine. He came to espouse ideas of Pan-Islamism and 
Pan-Turkism in Istanbul. After returning home in 1915, he, 
together with a few Turkish subjects, operated hospitals and 
schools in Ili. When speaking to students, they openly advocated 
the idea that "our ancestors were Turks" and that "our 
motherland is Turkey,"[.sup]4[/] and other ideas, completely 
deviating from the fundamental interests of the country and the 
nation and thus becoming spokesmen of foreign aggressors. 
  According to Masud himself: he operated the Turan, 
Deernaike, 
and Dongmaihailai schools in Ili.[.sup]5[/] The usual 
translation of Turan is now "Tulan." The Turkish Pan-Turkic 
theorist Ziya Gokalp argued that Turan was the "great 
motherland" of all Turks. The intention of using this term as 
the name of a school in Xinjiang was very obvious. At that time 
Yang Zengxin sent Prefecture Administrator Xu Guozhen to inspect 
the counties in Ili. It was found out that schools there were 
purely religious in nature, having no teachers of the Chinese 
language. It was thus suggested that the situation "be rectified 
immediately." According to later statistics: in the 1920s 
teaching was carried out completely in Turkish in the eight 
schools in Ili, with 28 classes, 68 teachers, and over 2,000 
students. Only three of those schools offered Chinese language 
courses. Those schools became important places used by Masud and 
others for propagating Pan-Turkism. 
  The instances of foreigners' openly operating schools in 
Xinjiang, especially in southern Xinjiang, were not isolated. 
For instance, in 1915 Luxierwaner [7120 1585 1422 1354 1422], a 
Tatar (customarily called tataer in Xinjiang), 
secretly opened a school in Kuche; in 1916 Yakefu [3660 0668 
3940] (also translated as Akububoke [7093 1655 1580 0130 0344]) 
opened a vocational school in Shache. In 1920 Imam Musuer [4476 
4790 1422] of Turpan and others hired a Tatar Hasanmihaiyideer 
[0761 2718 4717 3189 0044 1779 1422] and others to secretly open 
a school; also a Turkish national named Ismail Haqqi was sent by 
Ahmad Kamal to open a school in Hetian, etc. In those schools 
some domestic and foreign forces propagated ideas of 
Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, and selected and trained their 
agents. 
  2. Using religious activities to propagate ideas of 
Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism. There were imams teaching the 
scripture in all the cities, towns, and villages in Islamic 
areas of Xinjiang. Early this century this front was also 
exploited by some Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic forces. 
  In 1917 Yang Zengxin reported to the Internal Affairs 
Ministry that Turkish subjects were conducting rampant fomenting 
activities in the name of propagating the scripture, posing an 
unimaginable potential threat. The Internal Affairs Ministry 
returned a telegram the next year, claiming that it had been 
determined that the phenomenon of hiring Turkish subjects to 
teach the scripture was widespread across all the counties. It 
was also emphasized that "as Turkey and Germany are in an 
alliance and as China has declared war on Germany, Turkish 
subjects in Xinjiang will unavoidably carry out rampant cryptic 
fomenting activities in the name of propagating the 
scripture."[.sup]6[/] As shown here, the cryptic fomenting 
activities carried out by some forces in the name of religious 
activities had already produced some impact, arousing attention 
from the central and local authorities. 
  Without authorization, some mosques and scripture schools 
hired foreigners as Islam-propagating imams and teachers. Among 
those hired, some abused their forums and cryptically advocated 
evil ideas in the name of propagating the scripture and the 
Prophet's messages. Many of those who attended the 
scripture-propagating activities were seriously poisoned. In 
launching a rebellion in Kuche in 1918, Maimaitielihan [6314 
6314 6993 0500 3063] and others spread a rumor about the 
reincarnation of Mohammed so as to incite the local Muslim 
masses to a rebellion. In addition they used the slogan of "get 
rid of the Hans,"[.sup]7[/] adopting an open anti-Han stand 
and openly trying to evict the Hans. They were intentionally 
trying to foment ethnic hatred and to destroy the historical 
tradition of hundreds or thousands of years of the Uighur and 
Han nationalities's coexistence, coprosperity, and joint efforts 
to develop the border areas of the motherland as well as the 
profound friendship between the two nationalities. 
  3. Conducting propagating activities targeted at ordinary 
Muslims who went aborad on pilgrimage and who were worshiping at 
mosques. 
  Each year around 10,000 people from Xinjiang went to the 
holy 
place of Mecca on pilgrimage, travelling there through India or 
Central Asia. Some of those people would consciously or 
unconsciously come to espouse ideas of Pan-Islamism and 
Pan-Turkism, and bring back various books and journals; 
especially, those written in Turkish (the old script used before 
the reform) were mostly easily propagated and spread in 
Xinjiang. Some people also founded journals and wrote articles 
in Xinjiang. The aforementioned Ahmad Kamal first operated 
schools and published publications in southern Xinjiang, and 
then came to Urumqi where he on the one hand propagated 
Gasprinski's TERCUMAN, Jarullah's work Uzun Kunlarda Ruza 
(A Young Man in the Long Days) and others, and on the other 
hand devoted more energy to publishing the journal YENGI HAYAT, 
of which 30 issues were published. Ahmad Kamal himself said that 
the journal "has more directly, fervently, and candidly pointed 
out the way for Muslims."[.sup]8[/] As reported, at that time 
some people also founded the journal TURAN. In Xinjiang where 
there was a severe shortage of reading materials in the 
languages of the nationalities, the two journals produced 
unusual effects on Muslim youths. Also Chief Imam 
Abuduojiayidamaola [7093 0008 1122 0502 5902 1129 3029 2139] of 
Kashi requested several times for the permission to publish 
journals but the requests were rejected. Thus he put up 
handwritten propaganda posters in mosques, and read those 
posters to the masses, creating a large impact. Efforts were 
also made to print and circulate the book A Concise 
Biography of the Prophet Mohammed written in 1928 by Sabit 
Damullah (who became the prime minister of the illegitimate 
"Islamic Republic of Eastern Turkestan" in 1933). 
  In addition some foreign institutions and individuals and 
consulates of foreign countries in Xinjiang also mailed and sent 
propaganda material to some government officials. In 1917 
Prefecture Administrator Zhu Ruixi of Kashi received letters and 
documents from foreign Islamic leaders, which urged Chinese 
Muslims to ally with Germany in the First World War. Surely such 
letters and documents were not just sent to Zhu Ruixi alone. In 
1918 the British Consulate in Kashi sent to the county 
governments copies of the declaration by the governor of Mecca 
which called on the Arabs to shake off alien rule and achieve 
independence. All this constituted indirect and cryptic 
fomenting efforts targeted at the Muslim masses, and the 
intention involved was to create division and turmoil so as to 
harm the country. 
<H6>  III </H6>
  The infiltration of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism into 
Xinjiang aroused attention from Yang Zengxin from the very 
beginning. In order to maintain social stability in Xinjiang and 
safeguard his position as the ruler as well as national 
security, he adopted some preventive, restrictive, and punitive 
measures, producing some effects. 
  First, during the First World War, Turkey sided with Germany 
and exploited Pan-Turkism in carrying out aggression against 
other countries. After China severed her diplomatic relations 
with Germany, Yang Zengxin gave even greater attention to the 
activities of German and Turkish subjects in Xinjiang. He 
ordered a check on German and Turkish subjects in Xinjiang, and 
took different actions on the different cases after facts were 
ascertained. 
  In 1915 Magistrate Xiao Jianzhang of Shufu County reported 
that Ahmad Kamal was serving as a teacher at Small Artush 
Village. Yang Zengxin immediately checked the person's 
background, and at the same time reported to the Foreign 
Ministry of the Northern Warlord Government. He argued that as 
the European war was now going on, Turkish subjects were enemy 
aliens, and that if strict preventive and restrictive measures 
were not taken, they would unavoidably try to confuse and poison 
the minds of local people. "This will not only have harmful 
effects on diplomacy but also unavoidably pose a potential 
threat to China."[.sup]9[/] Consequently he ordered the 
closing of the elementary school run by Ahmad Kamal, and 
imprisoned the people involved. Although the school was later 
permitted to operate, it was explicitly stipulated that there be 
no manifestations of loyalty to Turkey and that Chinese language 
courses be offered. After being imprisoned for two years in 
Urumqi, Ahmad Kamal was repatriated to Turkey vie Shanghai in 
1919. Those moves undoubtedly dealt a severe blow to the 
Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic forces which had infiltrated Xinjiang. 
  In August 1916 Magistrate Liu Rentan reported that a Turkish 
subject Yakefu established a so-called vocational school, again 
arousing vigilance on the part of Yang Zengxin. He issued to his 
subordinates an order that Turkish subjects be prohibited from 
being hired as teachers and that Turkish subjects be prohibited 
from opening schools. As a result the authorities banned all the 
schools in such places as Kuche and Turpan which had been found 
to be using foreigners to do the teaching. 
  In February 1917, after learning that the Chinese Government 
had severed her diplomatic relations with Germany, Yang Zengxin 
immediately ordered a check on Turkish subjects in Xinjiang. 
Those who were engaged in legitimate business activities were 
given effective protection after the number of people, the 
businesses in which they were engaged, and the amount of 
property were ascertained; those propagating and teaching the 
scripture were prohibited from serving as imams, but were to be 
given effective protection, and were barred from leaving the 
country for the time being; as it was difficult to make sure 
that illegal businessmen and those who had, in an unauthorized 
manner, come to Xinjiang without tourist visas were not spies, 
strict precautionary measures were to be taken, and when 
necessary, it was permitted to detain those people, who would 
then be prohibited from leaving the country before their 
identities were ascertained. Yang Zengxin reported to the 
Internal Affairs Ministry, stating that If not being subjected 
to special restrictions, the Turkish subjects hired as imams in 
Xinjiang could pose a threat in various ways, and requesting 
that the Internal Affairs Ministry approve the continuation of 
the ban on Turkish subjects' propagating and teaching the 
scripture. The Internal Affairs Ministry returned a telegram to 
give its approval, while pointing out: "The matter involves 
local public order and is therefore not a light matter. It is 
necessary to conduct a check and impose a ban."[.sup]10[/] 
  In March Yang Zengxin gave his subordinates an order that if 
German or Turkish subjects were found in any place in Xinjiang, 
facts about them be ascertained, and they be detained on the 
spot and prohibited from having contacts with local people. At 
the time intelligence reports showed that seven Turkish 
subjects, carrying a huge amount of money, were going to travel 
from Gansu to Xinjiang in order to establish contact with 
Muslims. Yang Zengxin immediately sent telegrams to magistrates 
of the counties of Yanqi, Weili, Qiemo, and Ruoqiang, asking 
them to check the situation and take precautionary measures; at 
the same time he ordered a calvary force led by Company 
Commander Zou Weixin to move from Korla to Ruoqiang, so as to 
prevent Turkish subjects from secretly travelling to Xinjiang 
from Dunhuang. 
  In April the provincial government instructed each of the 
relevant county magistrates in southern Xinjiang to submit a 
report on the number of Turkish subjects living in the county. 
It was emphasized that Turkish subjects should keep themselves 
engaged in their own businesses and be prohibited from 
travelling to all the places to get involved in fomenting 
activities. Those who had lived in China for many years and who 
had not violated the law should be regarded as local residents, 
and those who had not gone through the procedure for acquiring 
Chinese citizenship should go through such citizenship procedure 
now, thereby becoming permanent Chinese citizens. 
  Yang Zengxin's check on the Turkish subjects who lived 
permanently or temporarily in Xinjiang and the Turkish subjects 
whose identities were unclear and whose behavior was suspicious 
lasted two or three years, resulting in some crackdown and 
restrictive effects on the activities of some lawless elements. 
  Second, Yang Zengxin realized that Xinjiang was in a unique 
geographical position, and thus paid great attention to the 
influence on Xinjiang exerted by some Central Asian countries 
bordering on Xinjiang. 
  In 1916 Yang Zengxin said in his report to the Northern 
Warlord Government: "Xinjiang is alone, situated outside the 
Great Wall. It is bordered by Russian territories to the 
northeast and British India to the southwest. Without exception, 
there are foreign businessmen and residents in each of the 40 
counties of Xinjiang. As many foreigners have come, any error in 
dealing with them would immediately lead foreign countries to 
intervene diplomatically."[.sup]11[/] An increasing number of 
foreigners, especially Turkish subjects and people of British 
India, entered the country from Afghanistan. In order to 
strengthen defense forces, Yang Zengxin decided to send forces 
stationed at the provincial capital to provide support. Thus as 
ordered, an army calvary force led by Ma Fengzhang and Dou Juxu 
moved to Puli County (Tashkurghan), becoming a garrison force 
there. With regard to the aforementioned letters and documents 
that foreign Islamic leaders had specially asked people to 
deliver to the prefecture administrator of Kashi, he ordered 
that the delivery people, together with the letters and 
documents, be made to leave the country under escort. He also 
issued a document to the localities, asking them to try their 
best to collect and burn copies of the declaration by the 
governor of Mecca that the British had distributed in Xinjiang. 
  In 1918 Yang Zengxin issued an order, banning unauthorized 
establishment of places of worship and prohibiting foreigners 
from using religious activities in places of worship for 
carrying out sinister plots. At the beginning of the next year 
he also issued an order to prohibit foreigners from serving as 
imams, describing those Islam-propagating imams as a source of 
disturbances. Their activities both had a religious element and 
affected local public order. If the activities were not banned, 
the potential threats posed by them could not be eliminated. 
  Third, while precautionary measures were taken against 
foreign-originated ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, 
coercive measures were taken against local people who had 
induced fomenting and deceptive propaganda from abroad. 
  In September 1925 Yang Zengxin instructed the prefecture 
administrator of Kashi to impose punishments on Bawuding and 
Yiming'aili of the local gentry, who had hired the Turkish 
subject Ahmad Kamal as a teacher; the next year Masud Sabri was 
arrested for operating a school in Ili to propagate splittist 
ideas and was sent to the provincial capital Dihua (Urumqi) 
under escort. He personally interrogated Masud Sabri three 
times; Masud Sabri was released after being detained for one 
year. Yang Zengxin used force to put down the rebellion which 
Maimaitielihan and others instigated in Kuche through using 
religious and ethnic slogans. 
  By openly resisting domestic and foreign hostile forces' 
efforts to carry out, through exploiting Pan-Islamism and 
Pan-Turkism, aggression against Xinjiang and activities of 
instigating the division of Xinjiang, Yang Zengxin both 
maintained his own position as the ruler and contributed to the 
unity of the country and unity among the nationalities. 
Nevertheless he was just a feudal bureaucratic warlord, and it 
was impossible for the measures he adopted to fundamentally 
suppress the infiltration of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism into 
Xinjiang. After his assassination in 1928, ideas of Pan-Islamism 
and Pan-Turkism got propagated in Xinjiang even more extensively 
because of the changes in the international situation, quickly 
getting Xinjiang caught in even greater turmoil.

<F P=106> [Article by Wen Wei (7186 3555): "Speak Up for the Peasants"] </F>
  [Text] Easing the peasants' burden has been an important 
part of rural work since last year. 
  Subsequent to the introduction of the State Council's 
"Provision on Managing the Peasants' Share of Expenses and 
Services," the abolition of 37 fund gathering, foundation, and 
fee collection programs was announced on 20 June. It was an 
important new measure, but in its actual implementation, are the 
localities doing what they please? 
<H3>  Deceiving Those Above and Below -- Jacking Up the Per Capita 
Net Income </H3>
  When a county in the western part of the central Shaanxi 
plains reported its per capita net income last year, the county 
statistics bureau compiled the figures submitted by the towns 
and townships and let the leader in charge of the bureau review 
the numbers before submitting them to the city. When the manager 
saw that the per capita net income was only 570 yuan, he thought 
it was far too low and immediately met with several deputy 
county heads to reach a consensus: "We have worked hard for the 
last year, and we have so little to show for. It won't do." In 
fact these people only had their own promotions in mind. The 
county chief who was in charge of agriculture summoned the head 
of the statistics bureau to the county government office and 
eventually changed the per capita net income to 590 yuan, and 
the number was then sent to the city. The city statistics bureau 
noticed that the per capita income of the people in a village in 
the mountains in a certain town was only 176 yuan. They worried 
that it might drag down the whole city's per capita income, and 
so the manager immediately called up the county statistics 
bureau which got in touch with the town statistician who said 
that the number had been reported by the town. The county 
statistics bureau later took it upon itself to change the per 
capita income to 340 yuan. The whole county's per capita net 
income was raised by 20 yuan, and based on the rule that the 
peasant's burden may not exceed 5 percent of the per capita 
income of the previous year, the county was taking away 1 yuan 
from every peasant. The county claimed that the peasant's share 
was only a little more than 4 percent, but in fact it was 9 
percent. 
  Relevant data show that counties tempering with the per 
capita net income figures is a nationwide practice; it is only a 
matter of how far each would go. 
<H5>  Rural Electricity Prices Turn Somersaults </H5>
  Walk around any village and mention electricity price and 
you 
will see how angry the peasant can get. They are very unhappy 
with the "electric tiger." Study shows that electricity prices 
differ among the 21 towns and townships and 250 villages in one 
county, and none is complying the current state-set price. Some 
charge more than three times the state-set rate; their receipts 
come in all shapes, colors, and forms. 
  From data provided by the electricity department, one learns 
that electricity rate for lighting is a three-tier system: low, 
normal, and peak rates which translate to 0.129 yuan per degree, 
0.257 yuan per degree, and 0.386 yuan per degree respectively. 
Motive electricity generally cost 0.207 yuan per degree. When I 
checked the receipts of the 312 electricity customers I visited 
in the county, I found most were standard invoices used in the 
cities and a few were town- and village-level invoices; some 
were blank slips. 
  The Chen family in Group 3 of Miganqiao Village in a certain 
township owns an electric oven (with two-phase motor.) When the 
electrician collects the bill, he adds the amount of electricity 
consumed by the oven to the bill. That household's monthly 
electric bill comes to an average of 50 yuan. The Sunjiabao 
Village in a certain township makes its own electric bills and 
charges as much as 0.70 yuan per degree, which shocks most 
people. Two villages in another town issues blank slips and 
charges 0.30 all the way up to 0.60 yuan per degree. Some 
peasant families have to make do with oil lamps. 
  Some village group cadres pay little or nothing for 
electricity. This has become a common practice. This is because 
village-level cadres can hire and fire electricians at will. 
Those who obey the village cadres, who do special favors for the 
cadres' families, and who do not charge the cadres will get the 
jobs, and so the electricians collaborate and add the cadres' 
household electric bills onto the other villagers' bills and 
even raise the charges as they please to let the cadres reap a 
profit. 
<H5>  Improper Apportionment Still Runs Rampant </H5>
  Today, when the leading cadres go out, they want to show 
off. 
They want fancy cars, the best-selling cars. They get money by 
hook or by crook so that they can buy cars. They use bank loans 
to buy cars; they spend official administrative funds on cars. 
Despite specific regulations handed down by the State Council 
regarding the grades of cars they can buy, everybody, regardless 
of rank, is buying a Santana. 
  A certain township has a new "Beijing" jeep. In June of this 
year [as published], it appropriated 20,000 from each 
township-affiliated enterprise, and without getting permission 
from the purchase-control office, bought a Santana. A few days 
later, the county financial bureau sent someone down to 
investigate. The township leader wined and dined him and paid a 
fine. An illegal car was thus legalized. The year's jeep is to 
be used by the county leaders when they go to the villages, and 
the new Santana is for use when they go to town. 
  Today, the township party committee secretary reportedly is 
rewarded for the clever apportionment and is put to work in high 
places by the county leadership. 
  Appropriating money from township enterprises in fact is 
adding to the peasants' burdens. 
<H5>  Some Thoughts on Easing the Burden </H5>
  Since the 1980's, the Party Central Committee and the State 
Council have paid special attention to the issue of the 
peasants' burden. They have always made protecting the peasants' 
interests the most important starting point of their rural work. 
They have promulgated a series of policies and measures which 
have played a definite role in easing the peasants' burden. But 
why is the cancer of heavy burden still here? The problem lies 
in the fact that some localities and departments are 
half-hearted in carrying out the policies; they move and then 
stop, and they distort the policies, or they just go through the 
motion of carrying out the policies. 
  One of the keys to reducing the peasants' burden lies in the 
hands of the leading departments at all levels, because many 
projects that add to the peasants' burden originate from these 
departments. If they do not have a sound and clear understanding 
of the problem of the peasants' heavy burden, if they do not 
begin to take effective measures, it will be difficult to solve 
the problem. To reduce the peasants' burden, there must be a set 
of laws and regulations which would severely punish those who 
impose heavy burdens on the peasants, so that the party's rural 
policy can be implemented smoothly and without obstacle. To ease 
the peasants' burden, all sides must work together and lend 
their support. Speeding up rural economic development and 
increasing the peasants' income are also necessary conditions 
for easing the peasants' burden.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhi Yan (4160 6056): "What Do the Village Branch </F>
Secretaries Dislike Most During New Year?" The author is from 
Wuxian County's Changshu Town in Jiangsu Province's Suzhou City] 
  [Text] Chinese New Year will soon be here. When I asked the 
village branch secretaries how they were doing, they all said, 
"Things are tough." 
  Those who said New Year was a tough time fall into two 
categories. The first are those from villages with a 
fast-growing economy. The higher-level managing department 
leaders have become frequent visitors to these economically 
advance villages. If these were normal relationships established 
in the course of work, one would see nothing wrong with them. 
The problem is, there are always some department leaders who 
want to bring home some native products or some handicrafts. 
That is taken to be the usual practice. To forge better 
relations, enhance friendship, and make things work smoothly, 
the villages naturally are eager to oblige and ready to give 
gifts on every visit. The village cadres have no choice but to 
put on a happy face all day and be ready to socialize. It is 
very hard indeed. 
  In villages where the economy has been developing rapidly, 
the cadres are busy receiving and sending off guests at 
year-end; they can hardly handle the amount of socializing. But 
what about the poor villages? The village branch secretaries 
have just as difficult a time. Few high-level visitors bother to 
come, but many from below show up. Year after year, village 
cadres are owed wages. Those who understand are less of a 
problem, but those who don't understand simply walk away. The 
villagers come to get medical expense reimbursement for an only 
child; old people come in with the aid of walking sticks to 
collect their 40 yuan pension; there are electric bills, 
telephone bills, special allowances, and joint defense expenses; 
there are taxes and fees which they cannot afford to pay. Those 
who run the villages say that getting through New Years is 
harder than finding refuge from disasters. 
  Alas, cadres at all levels, please understand the village 
branch secretaries' problems. Go deep into the grass-roots level 
to solve practical problems. One should add flowers to the 
brocades -- make perfection still more perfect, but it is even 
more important to provide charcoal in snowy weather --provide 
timely help.

<F P=106> [Letter to the editor entitled "Whom Should I Tell My </F>
Troubles To?"] 
  [Text] Comrade Editor, 
  My name is Zheng Meiling [6774 5019 3781]. I am a member of 
the Number 2 Brick Factory of Regiment 123, 7th Agricultural 
Division in Xinjiang's Kuytun. I have had little education. 
Since my divorce in 1988, I have been raising three children on 
my own. Last year, I planted more than 70 mu of cotton down in 
the farm. After handing over the farm's share, I took home the 
remaining cotton and was going to sell it to Regiment 123's 
processing plant. On 17 November of last year, I rounded up 
several fellow villagers to load the cotton onto a cart. We 
packed more than 4,000 kilos of cotton and covered the cart with 
canvas. Night fell before the selling procedure was completed, 
so I left the cart in front of my house. I was afraid someone 
would steal the cotton, so I stayed up all night. That night 
someone came and dragged the cotton cart away. Someone told me 
that those people were from the local police station, because 
they suspected that my cotton had belonged to someone else. I 
went after them to get my cart back. They said, "You must pay us 
a hundred yuan, hand over the cotton that does not belong to 
you, and pay us back the wages we had paid to the men who got 
the cotton, and then you can have the cotton back. We paid 100 
yuan to hire that cart." I spent two days and went there four 
times. They said, "We have weighed your cart already and 
unloaded the cotton at the processing plant." I toiled for more 
than a month, running back and forth more than 20 times. My feet 
were badly frostbitten; I could hardly walk. During that period, 
I have gone to the leaders of the 14th Company to prove that I 
was a member of the brick factory, I had planted the cotton in 
the farm, and that I was living in the 14th Company's family 
compound. I have also gone to the farm's cadres. They said, "She 
has delivered her share. We told her to take the remaining 
cotton and sell it." But they still decided to fine me 500 
yuan. At that time, they had not given me the ticket. On 16 
December, I went to the police station to get the cotton ticket, 
the deputy chief told me to hand over 500 yuan. In my present 
condition, I could not come up with 20 yuan, let alone 500. I 
did not give him the money, and they would not give me the 
ticket, and without that ticket, I could not settle the account 
and get my money, and without money, my children and I would 
soon die. To borrow the 500 yuan, I ran around for two days. It 
was no easy task, but I got the 500 yuan and got the ticket, but 
it said I had delivered only 3,510 kilos. My big piece of canvas 
was gone too. Now my family owes people more than 10,000 yuan. 
We have no electrical appliances at home. There is only the four 
of us and three beds. I singlehandedly raise three students. The 
oldest is enrolled in the Bayi Agricultural College this year; 
number two is enrolled in Dongyin Petroleum College. Both are 
four-year, full-time college students. The youngest is in his 
third year of junior high. I depend on the cotton I plant to 
send them to school. The cotton was hard-earned! In the seven 
months from 17 April when I sowed the seeds until the time I 
picked the cotton, rain or shine, and no matter how hot, I 
brought a steamed bun and a bottle of water, and at noon, I 
worked and ate at the same time. In July, one after another, my 
three children came home for vacation. Every morning, they came 
down to the farm at 8 o'clock and returned home at 3 o'clock and 
came down again at 5 o'clock and would not go home until 11 
o'clock. They worked till school started again. They only took 
one day off. I am 42 years old. Just watering the land would 
take me several days and nights. All by myself, I picked the 
cotton, had them weighed, paid for them, and delivered the 
cotton. We worked hard for a whole year and bought everything 
with our own sweat and blood, and in just one sentence, they 
fined me 500 yuan. The leader even said, "You got off easy with 
a 500-yuan fine. According to the regiment's regulations, your 
cotton should have been confiscated." 
  Comrade editor, tell me, whom should I tell my troubles to?

<F P=106> [Letter to the editor by Xiang Gan (3276 1626): "What Do the </F>
Village Cadres Want?"] 
  [Text] Comrade Editor: 
  We village cadres come into contact with the tail-end of the 
party's and the state's policies, principles, and lines, and we 
are the ones who faithfully carry out the party's rural 
policies. It is our obligation to serve the people. But these 
days, many of the rural tasks really bewilder and puzzle us. 
  First, there is family planning. Family planning is the 
nation's fundamental policy, but to us, it is the most difficult 
task on earth. 
  Second, we have to collect grain payment and taxes. In the 
past, it was the crown grain and state taxes which no one could 
refuse. Last year, grain prices were decontrolled and the 
villages' unified apportionment and procurement responsibilities 
with regard to grains were rescinded. But this year, our 
superiors have forced us to get money and grain from the 
peasants based on their past apportionment and procurement 
responsibilities; otherwise they would refuse to pay wages. In 
the past, agricultural tax could be offset by grain payment, but 
today, grain prices are higher than the agricultural 
tax--generally the difference is 5 yuan per dan. If the peasants 
pay all of their agricultural tax but do not deliver some grain 
for the remaining apportionment and procurement 
responsibilities, they must pay 5 yuan per dan to cover the 
price difference. Most of their money is handed over to the 
grain stations, and the peasants do not even get a piece of 
paper as receipt. We feel that we are the "bandits" and are in 
turn "robbed." Even though we do not want to be "bandits," the 
peasants have no choice but to look at us coldly with frowning 
brows. 
  Third, we have to make the peasants buy insurance. Our wages 
were docked last December and we still have not been paid. This 
is because we have not completed the insurance tasks that were 
assigned to us. According to our assignment, each peasant must 
pay the insurance companies 10 yuan for insurance. In the remote 
and poor countryside, this is indeed a task we cannot accomplish. 
  Fourth, our superiors come to check on us: When the leaders 
come, they eat, drink, and have a good time. Afterwards, they 
sometimes even want us to pay them wages. 
  Fifth, the public security bureaus and local police stations 
send people to the homes of criminal elements to collect fines. 
Thousands and thousands have been collected, but there is not a 
single receipt. 
  Faced with poverty and corruption, what should we do? What 
are the responsibilities of the county, district, and village 
cadres? How do we do our jobs? We would appreciate the public's 
comments.

<F P=106> [Editorial note in column entitled: "Forget Not the Village </F>
Elders and Town Folks"] 
  [Text] Editorial Note: The Party Central 
Committee and the State Council have issued orders again and 
again to reduce the peasants' burdens. Today, the focus of rural 
work is on accelerating rural economic development and 
increasing the peasants' income. Now that the masses of peasants 
are warmly clothed and well-fed, income has become the issue of 
greatest concern to them. To prompt society to pay more 
attention to the rural areas, we have compiled some letters and 
essays from the rural areas. On the one hand, they reflect some 
of the poor conditions in the rural areas, and on the other 
hand, we urge comrades who have contact with the peasants and 
the villages not to further add to the peasants' burden by 
artificial means.

<F P=106> [Article by Ai Min (5337 3046): "State-Owned Coal Mines </F>
Distressed By Artificially Lowered Prices; Government Adjustment 
and Control Brings Hope of Alleviating Problem"] 
  [Text] Early in the morning of 14 January, I received a 
letter from Guo Zhimin [6753 3112 3045] of the Urumqi Bureau of 
Mining Affairs, No. 1 Coal Mining Area, Jiangou Coal Mine. In 
this letter, he related the living difficulties of coal miners. 
I reproduce some passages below: 
  "In this era of opening and reform, the domestic economy is 
increasing rapidly. Through 31 December (1993), our mine has had 
1,373 continuous days of safe production, our No. 1 Coal Mining 
Area has had as much as 7,019 continuous days of safe 
production, and in addition, we have accomplished the entire 
year's assigned output 20 days ahead of schedule." 
  "However, in our coal mine it is hard to even pay wages, let 
alone give out bonuses. In 1993, there was no one in the entire 
mine who received full wages. The mine leaders decided to pay 90 
percent (of their wages) to the first line workers who work 
underground, 80 percent to the second line workers, while they 
themselves received only 35 percent. In the mine's electronic 
section, supply section, and labor service company, not only 
were just 80 percent of the wages given out, they also only gave 
100 people the wages of 90 people, leaving them to work out the 
shortages. How are they supposed to cope with this?" 
  "The problem is coal's lack of value. It now costs more than 
71 yuan to produce one ton of coal, while it can only be sold at 
a fixed price of 67 yuan, so that producing one ton of coal 
causes the mine to suffer a loss of over 4 yuan. The more coal 
we produce, the greater the loss. We have heard that the prices 
of steel, wood, and cement--essential goods for mining 
coal--will rise in 1994, and that tax revenue will rise from 
(1993's) 2.17 yuan per ton to 13.6 yuan per ton. So the cost of 
producing each ton of coal will be up to 100 yuan. At that time, 
we fear that we coal miners will not have enough to eat." 
  "Everyone knows that a coal miner's work is very hard. While 
making more contributions to society, we hope that our lives 
will improve year by year along with the whole nation." 
  That same afternoon, I took the letter to the Urumqi Bureau 
of Mining Affairs, located in the city's suburbs. The leaders of 
the Bureau were not there, but the person in charge of the 
Planning Department was, and after reading the letter, said 
frankly that, "This matter of inability to pay wages is not just 
confined to the Jiangou coal mine. To some degree it exists in 
every one of the Bureau's coal mines. The major cause is the 
lower coal price for the State-owned coal mines. In 1993, the 
average coal price for the whole bureau was only 68 yuan, while 
the prices for the "three types of materials" needed for coal 
mining have been going up, the cost of maintaining and replacing 
coal mining facilities has risen, the level of charges by 
relevant industries and departments for producing and selling 
things linked to mining are also rising. These increases have 
pushed the per ton cost of to more than 90 yuan. When there is a 
major increase in the cost of production, while the price of 
coal is fixed and cannot be raised, it is inevitable that 
enterprises will suffer losses." 
  "It is not just our bureau: the entire coal enterprise 
industry is suffering losses. In the past, there was a State 
subsidy given to our State-owned key coal mines, more than 10 
yuan for every ton of coal produced. With the key State-owned 
coal mines from throughout Xinjiang having an output of over 4.4 
million tons of coal, the amount of the subsidy got up to more 
than 60 million yuan. Since 1993, the State has gradually 
relaxed the price of coal and reduced the subsidy, to push 
State-owned key coal mines to the market. Although these are 
good measures, much depends on how they are implemented. Look, 
the subsidy to our Bureau was cut by more than half, but the 
price of coal hasn't be relaxed completely. In addition, default 
payments are hard to get, many mine directors are very worried 
at payday, and even the cleverest housewife can't cook a meal 
without rice--one can't make bricks without straw." At the 
Bureau's Publicity Section, I saw the "Information Extracts 
Report" edited by the Bureau and issued on 7 January. The report 
listed the Bureau's debit account: there was a debit of 9.32 
million yuan for safe production facilities and equipment, a 
debit of 19.41 million yuan for developing production, a debit 
of 16.37 million yuan for construction projects, and a debit of 
23.56 millon yuan for staff and workers' welfare. The 
construction company attached to the Bureau was listed as in 
"extreme difficulties", with 80 percent of its workers paid only 
75 yuan for living expenses in 1993. 
  On the afternoon of the 15th, I called at the office Li 
Yifan 
[2621 0111 0416], Vice General Manager of the Xinjiang Coal 
Shipping and Marketing Company, seeking his opinions concerning 
relaxing the price of coal. He said that it is imperative to 
relax the coal price in Xinjiang's State-owned key mines; this 
would be an important step towards putting enterprises onto the 
track of the market economy and to compete on an equal footing 
with local and privately owned coal mines. The mining affairs 
bureaus in Ningxia, Shanxi, Henan, and Xinjiang Hami have raised 
their coal prices from 20 to 30 yuan, but nothing has been done 
in the Urumqi Bureau of Mining Affairs. 
  "The Autonomous Region's government leaders care about 
reform 
in coal enterprises and the lives of coal miners." Vice General 
Manager Li told me that after repeated estimates, Vice Chairmen 
Wang Lequan [3769 2867 3123] and Wang Yousan [3769 2589 0005] 
have approved a 30 yuan per ton rise in the price of coal, which 
has brought it up to 98 yuan per ton since 1 January 1994. This 
will undoubtedly be good news for the Bureau's 12,000 coal 
miners." 
  Will the rise in coal prices affect the lives of the 
Xinjiang 
Autonomous Region's masses? Vice general Li's answer is, "The 
whole of Xinjiang produces over 22 million tons of coal every 
year. About one-tenth of this, about 2 million tons, is from the 
Urumqi Bureau. It won't have too much affect on the lives of the 
masses."

<F P=106> [Article by Staff Reporter Liu Feng (0491 2800) and </F>
Correspondent Dong Feng (5516 1496): "Xinjiang's Cotton 
Industry--Where Is the Hope? Analysis and Summary of Xinjiang's 
Current Cotton Industry"] 
  [Text] Xinjiang's cotton industry, which had been 
brilliant, now faces the straits of a "cold winter." People look 
forward to the coming of spring. 
  The cotton industry in Xinjiang enjoyed a good time for 
production and sales in the eighties, making it one of the 
"three types of high" industries of high output value, high 
profit, and high income, and jumped to the status of one of the 
region's pillar industries. 
  The implementation of reform has pushed cotton industry 
enterprises into the market. Now the cotton industry is finding 
it hard to survive, lying where the mountains and the rivers 
end--at the end of its resources, anxiously anticipating the 
coming of new hope. Looking at the regional cotton industry's 
output for January to September, the forecast for 1993 was for a 
3.89 percent decrease from 1992. Among the major cotton 
products, estimates were that only 700,000 units of yarn would 
be produced, an 11.81 percent reduction from 1992; only an 
estimated 210 million meters of cotton cloth accomplished, down 
6.51 percent from 1992, and at the level of a decade ago; only 
an estimated 39 million meters of printing and dying cloth, a 
reduction of 28.55 percent from 1992, and only slightly higher 
than the output of 30 years ago. Up to the end of September last 
year, the gross industrial output value achieved was 960 million 
yuan, a reduction of 19.13 percent for the same period in 1992. 
The cumulative loss for the cotton industry was 120 million yuan. 
  The cotton industry's fall from its previous brilliance to 
its current difficult situation is due to the following factors: 
  --The scale of the national cotton industry is too big, with 
gross supplies exceeding demand, so products accumulate badly. 
In 1980, China had 17.80 million spindles of cotton yarn; in 
1990, this had increased rapidly to 42 million spindles of 
cotton yarn, while the practical demand was for just 27 million 
spindles. In the past decade, the spindles in storage occupied 
over 40 percent of the year's requirement. 
  --A heavy burden of "triple debt" and declining efficiency 
led to enterprises' shortages of operating funds. Based on 
Cotton Bureau statistics, cotton enterprises currently owe more 
than 300 million yuan to cotton and gunny companies for raw 
material, and owe over 500 million yuan to cotton plants outside 
the region. Combined with enterprise losses, it has led to 
shortages of capital, forcing some enterprises to stop or cut 
back on production. 
  --A lower level of equipment and production quality and 
standard. At present, the regional production scale is up to 100 
thousand spindles, with only 4.6 percent having world advanced 
equipment, while 17.4 percent of them being equipments which 
should have been eliminated before the founding of new China or 
in the fifties. Enterprises lack staying power, and their 
products noncompetitive. 
  --There is a big shortage of transportation. Two-thirds of 
Xinjiang's cotton products are sold outside the region, which is 
about 120,000 tons of cotton products going out of Xinjiang 
every year. The market is focused chiefly along the Guangdong, 
Jiangsu, and Zhejiang areas; a shortage of railway cars makes 
transportation difficult, which seriously affects enterprises' 
production and sales. 
  --Unstable teams of enterprise staff and workers. Low 
economic efficiency causes low income among staff and workers, 
so there is a serious outflow of technical mainstays. 
  --A lot of work is urgently needed to bring a "brilliant 
spring" in the cotton industry. 
  One way of accomplishing this is through earning foreign 
currency by export. It is only by stressing the production of 
high standard, high quality, and high level products can 
enterprises create international markets. In 1993, as a new 
force suddenly coming to the fore, the Kuerle Cotton Plant did 
extraordinarily well in its pursuit of exports. From January to 
September, they exported 6,399 tons of cotton yarn, with an 
export value of 20.62 million yuan, which constituted 40 percent 
of Xinjiang's total. This greatly increased efficiency, and the 
1993 forecast is for losses to be down 55 percent from last year. 
  Enterprises change patterns and styles in order to survive. 
The Shihezhi Bayi Wool Spinning Plant took the lead in 
establishing a new enterprise management guidance principle of 
"taking the market as the leading direction, taking sales as the 
head, taking efficiency as the focal point." They carried out 
self-decision operations, self-responsibility for profits and 
losses, and self-planned development, put over 40 million yuan 
into technology replacement, introduced advanced equipment, 
finally spinning 65-80 high-tech yarn, and a high-woof, light, 
thin, product of about 300g for the south China market. By 
developing new products, they created an output value of 139 
million yuan from January to September last year, leading the 
enterprise onto a good circulation track. 
  Pay attention to the enterprise, dig out its internal 
potential, increase income while cost-cutting, reduce 
expenditures on raw materials, and realize efficiencies from 
basic enterprise management. 
  Favorable policies are sorely needed. For the cotton 
industry, Xinjiang has the obvious shortcoming of poor location, 
so it can compete with inland enterprises only through good 
quality and low price. Last year's cotton price rise no doubt 
was a case of "snow added to frost" for the cotton industry. The 
government should: extend favorable policies on technology 
replacement, loans, and investment; reform the cotton supply 
system, reducing middlemen by guaranteeing the supply of raw 
materials; and, in addition, absolutely prohibit price rises in 
cotton circulation links to help enterprises get through these 
difficult times and get on a good circulation track. If these 
things are done, for Xinjiang's cotton industry the snow will 
melt, the rains stop, the winds cease, and the spring breezes 
blow again.

"Concern for Decline of Fine Wool Production in Xinjiang"] 
  [Text] On 10 December 1993, I attended a forum held by the 
Xinjiang Bureau of Husbandry and which included some experts on 
sheep raising. The experts who presented the forum expressed 
deep concerns about the current status of Xinjiang's production 
of fine wool, which has been in continuous decline in recent 
years. 
  In their introduction, relevant people explained that fine 
wool is chiefly used for supplying the raw materials in wool 
spinning. In the last two years, lower wool prices plus part of 
the wool being kept in storage has dampened the enthusiasm of 
local cadres and masses of herdsmen for producing fine wool. But 
on the other hand, mutton prices rose repeatedly in 1993. 
Because the cost of raising fine wool sheep is a bit higher than 
for local wool sheep, there appeared a trend of ignoring fine 
wool sheep production, even to the point of not buying male 
sheep for stud and rejecting artificial insemination. This 
caused a backward trend in varietal improvement while resulting 
in a great number of stud male sheep being in stock. 
  All of the sheep-raising experts making presentations were 
deeply upset about fine wool sheep suffering such cold 
treatment. Xinjiang has 40 years of history of improving fine 
wool sheep varieties, starting in the fifties, and it has 
reached today's level only after several generations' of hard 
work. Raising fine wool sheep is an industry of excellence in 
Xinjiang, and it holds first place nationally, regardless of 
whether one speaks of quantity or quality; if we lose this 
dominant position, the dominant position of Xinjiang's husbandry 
will be lost with it, and the region's wool spinning industry, 
with over 100,000 spindles will be in the bad situation of 
lacking raw materials. 
  Research Fellow Yang Erji [2799 1422 3444], formerly 
Assistant Director of the Autonomous Region's Institute of 
Animal Husbandry, 1422 3444) believes that mutton production and 
fine wool sheep production should be given equal attention, with 
no partiality to either side. We must not lose confidence 
because of the current temporary slump in the wool market, but 
must take the long view. The wool spinning industry has 
developed very rapidly in China, with the nation having to spend 
$600 million importing 150,000 tons of wool. This demonstrates 
that it there is not too much, but far from enough. We should 
take development of fine wool sheep and protection of our 
national wool production as long term and difficult assignments 
for China and Xinjiang. Also, when we speak of increasing the 
quantity of mutton, doing a good job of raising fine wool sheep 
can be an important way of easing the demand for mutton in 
Xinjiang. 
  Of course, future development should pursue the goal of 
improving the quality of fine wool, or else a great deal of 
foreign wool will come in after we have joined GATT, and 
Xinjiang's fine wool will probably be defeated. We especially 
should popularize Chinese Meilinu sheep, setting out a goal 
higher than the more than one million Meilinu sheep which this 
established breeding system attained some time ago. Meanwhile, 
we should take full advantage of our natural grasslands for 
feed; strengthen feed supplements in winter and spring, taking 
crude feed as the major feed, cutting down on the use of fine 
feed to reduce feed costs for fine wool sheep. At the same time, 
we should grant such favoritism as a husbandry industry 
insurance system, a variety of tax rates, etc. Adopting these 
protective measures will reverse the declining situation of fine 
wool sheep production in Xinjiang in the fastest possible time, 
and create a wonderful future for fine wook sheep production.

<F P=106> ["Two Kinds of Time" column by Jonathan Mirsky: "White </F>
Paper Is Plain Propaganda"] 
  [Text] Imagine your average Legco member -- like most of 
us averagely decent, averagely cowardly -- with a corner of his 
or her heart in which he or she wants to do the right thing. 
  China, meanwhile, is huffing and puffing that it will blow 
Legco down in 1997. 
  Last Thursday, our modest hero heard Sir Percy Cradock say 
on 
TV that "Legco had signed its own death warrant" when it 
approved the first tranche of Chris Patten's bill. 
  Was this person, not to mention the umbrella mender and the 
cobbler in Sai Kung, really convinced by last week's White Paper 
on the 17 Anglo-British negotiations sessions? The British must 
hope so: they printed 140,000 copies in Chinese and 60,000 in 
English. But the White Paper is only convincing if, as a British 
official suggested last week, you take it on faith. 
  Suppose you are not a devout believer in Britain, often 
referred to here as "the two-headed snake"? Suppose you want to 
believe that Britain negotiated sincerely and that Beijing's men 
stonewalled, but suppose also that you need proof before you 
would be willing to enrage Beijing by voting for the rest of the 
Patten plan on July 6? There is no evidence in the White Paper; 
it is, frankly, a piece of propaganda. This does not mean it is 
a lie; it is like the statement of a lawyer who, though he must 
not commit perjury, is not required to make the best case for 
the other side. 
  British and Hong Kong officials seem insulted by the 
suggestion that the White Paper as it stands is no more to be 
relied on than the 10,000-word article that appeared in the 
PEOPLE'S DAILY on January 7, which gave China's side of the 
collapse of negotiations. 
  "You mean you think we're the same as the Chinese?" an 
incredulous official asked last week when I observed that I 
could not "believe" the White Paper. I meant of course "believe 
in". 
  When asked to supply documentation (there exists, afterall, 
a 
nearly 1,000-page stenographic record of the 17 sessions), the 
official said: "But these are confidential diplomatic 
documents," -- as if publishing the White Paper has not already 
blown the roof off diplomatic niceties. 
  We don't need the full 1,000 pages. But where the White 
Paper makes its most telling charges of Chinese shiftiness or 
reneging, our confidence would be boosted by verbatim quotes 
showing which Chinese diplomat said what, when he said it, and 
when he said the opposite. 
  Of course, some would say such quotes had been invented. But 
most people would not doubt such evidence, unless the Chinese 
produced their own and different stenographic record. 
  If that happened, it would only confirm what the White Paper 
and the PEOPLE'S DAILY accounts already indicate -- that (as 
some British officials here now concede "in retrospect") there 
never was any common ground between the two sides, just a chasm 
between different goals and beliefs, which could be spanned only 
by flimsy bridges like agreement on lowering the voting age. 
  Showing extracts from the actual record would expose this 
chasm, which is far more important than proving bad faith. The 
bad faith, if it exists, is primarily a result of the chasm. 
What also hinders understanding is the way the government 
managed "to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory" (as one 
official put it) after the Legco vote last week. 
  By Thursday, many Hong Kong journalists -- including those 
from the non-Communist Chinese press -- were expressing 
scepticism about the White Paper. Those who asked for more 
documentation were treated as troublemakers or eccentrics. 
  The official Hong Kong government press conference on Friday 
reminded some of us who have attended similar events in Beijing 
that 1997 is only three years away. 
  Chinese officials commonly preface their reply to a 
difficult 
follow-up question by saying "It is well known to all that..." 
and then repeating their earlier statements. 
  Last week in Hong Kong, senior officials -- some wearing the 
same scornful looks on their faces one recalls from Beijing -- 
also deflected questions by dismissing them as "speculation" or 
with curt instructions to "Read the Letters Patent". 
  This last came when the officials were asked under what 
circumstances Patten and Parliament could refuse to ratify 
Legco's vote in July, as Patten hinted last week he might, in 
some circumstances, regretfully have to do. What we were told 
was that it was "up to the people of Hong Kong", or, again, 
"Read the Letters Patent". Is this how the government plans to 
respond to Legco members who need to know what might happen if 
the council, for example, attempted to pass any of Beijing's 
proposals. 
  What came out last Friday should indeed worry the average 
Legco member. 
  He is pincered between Beijing's promise of revenge and the 
threat that Patten and Parliament may reject any bill that does 
not meet their purposes. 
  Appealed to for clarification, a Government House source 
sighed. "Oh God, the answer is so simple -- the Governor is the 
Queen of Hong Kong."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Future Is All That Matters"] </F>
  [Text] Now we know all about it. All the nitty-gritty of 
17 rounds of Sino-British talks over eight months ending with 
barriers lowered on 30 June, 1997. No more through train, no 
smooth transition, perhaps no replacement airport until after 
the transfer of sovereignty, no new container port, no new 
highways into southern China, no recognition by the future 
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] 
of any contracts or international loans going beyond 1997. 
  All the details contained in 36 pages entitled 
Representative 
Government in Hong Kong, otherwise known as the White Paper on 
how the talks went. 
  A few points need to be stressed at the outset. Firstly, 
this is a British version of the talks. As such it is intended 
to serve British interests. Beijing has given notice that it 
will respond by publishing its own version. No doubt it will 
serve Chinese interests. 
  Secondly, by going public the British side has cast away the 
key to a reopening of the negotiations. Of course, the blame 
has been put on China: the People's Daily went public with a 
detailed version of the 17 rounds last month. But, no doubt, 
Beijing had read an equally authoritative blow-by-blow version 
in London's Financial Times weeks earlier. So much for 
confidentiality--both sides have been leaking like mad while 
trying to keep Hong Kong people in the dark. 
  Thirdly, this document is not all that it is made out to be. 
On the matter of functional constituencies, for instance, we 
are told the British were prepared to compromise. But we are 
not told what those initiatives were. That is just one example 
of details the British regard as unimportant for Hong Kong 
people. 
  Finally, how credible is this paper? The answer appears to 
lie in omissions and in details which have been glossed over. 
  Before the negotiations began and at the outset of the talks 
China had insisted on one condition: that there be no 
unilateral action on political reforms if the talks broke down. 
The whole world now knows that the original proposals are being 
pushed through the Legislative Council and the contents of the 
talks, at least the British side of it, are on display in this 
dreary and repetitive document. 
  We know from the Chinese side that the British at one point 
proposed a functional constituency for civil servants. This has 
been omitted. What else is hidden from Hong Kong people? It 
would also appear that the issue of appointed members to the 
district boards and municipal councils was more crucial than was 
made out to be [as published] by the British while the 
negotiations were going on. It now appears to have been a major 
obstacle. 
  That Britain also wanted a say in the affairs of the future 
HKSAR government is irrefutable. What other construction is one 
to put on the admission that Britain wanted China to accept an 
agreed formula for the composition of the Election Committee as 
"the same model for the future selection and election committees 
for chief executives"? [sentence as published] China has long 
maintained that Britain has been manoeuvring to retain its 
influence, if not its power over Hong Kong after 1997. The 
document now confirms this. 
  It does not serve the interests of Hong Kong and its people 
to dwell on the past. The talks are over, there is no way to 
reopen them. 
  What matters now is the future. As we move towards 1997 the 
British will become more irrelevant with each passing day. 
  We must learn to take the long-term view and plan 
accordingly.

<F P=106> [Editorial:"Encouraging Signs"] </F>
  [Text] It may be too early, but so far the signs are 
encouraging. Incredible as it might seem, if the past few days 
are any indication, Beijing looks like it has drawn a line under 
political reform and decided to allow cooperation to continue in 
other areas. 
  Although the most hardline of mainland officials continue to 
utter dire threats that the gazettal of the electoral bill will 
harm Sino-British relations on all fronts, this has so far not 
proved to be the case. Instead there was the incredible sight 
of Chinese negotiators giving ground over the size of their 
future naval base on Stonecutters Island, during last week's 
defence lands talks, even as Governor Chris Patten was 
announcing his decision to go it alone on political reform. 
Then there was the heartening declaration from Guangdong Public 
Security Bureau Chief Chen Shaoji that cross-border co-operation 
would not be affected by the row. Yesterday, Chief Secretary 
Anson Chan Fang On-sang even predicted that a date for further 
airport talks may be agreed this week. 
  That will be the acid test of Beijing's intentions. The wind 
can change very fast in Zhongnanhai, and Chinese leaders may yet 
decide they need to use all the weapons at their disposal to try 
and drive down public support for Mr Patten to encourage 
legislators to vote down his proposals. But, for the moment at 
least, China seems to have recognised the harm that could result 
to its and the territory's interests, in following a strategy of 
severing co- operation on all fronts. That means there can be 
some hope that the years ahead may not be as rough as might 
otherwise have been expected.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Momentous Days"] </F>
  [Text] These are truly momentous days in Hong Kong. In 
spite of angry fist-shaking from that powerful neighbour across 
the border -- and future sovereign -- the Legislative Council 
[Legco] has approved the political reforms that pave the way for 
more democracy to come to the territory. The vote by all but a 
few voices in the early hours of yesterday morning will go down 
in history as a watershed. Councillors who made it possible in 
the full knowledge that they were doing what was best for the 
people, even though, if China carries out its threat, the worthy 
edifice they have now begun building will be destroyed in 1997, 
deserve great credit. Quite properly, there was some dissent 
but also, quite properly, the majority was vindicated. 
  Hong Kong's legislators are to be commended for a mature, 
responsible and fearless first step on the long and troublesome 
road of democratisation. There was a 100 per cent attendance 
for the debate that Beijing warned should not take place. Mr 
Patten, too, deserves a fair share of the praise. It is after 
all, his name which is attached to the reforms. He has defended 
them relentlessly and effectively both at home and abroad. 
Moreover, he possessed the courage and, it must be added, the 
sense to trust them in the hands of the legislature. That trust 
proved well-founded. 
  Now the twin pillars of Hong Kong's administration -- 
Executive and Legislature -- can face the uncertain future 
hand-in-hand. As Mr Patten noted yesterday, it was never the 
intention of the British to dump the reforms on Legco and then 
scarper [run away]. Rather, what was being formed was a new 
partnership. The legislators who voted the way they believe 
their constituencies wanted have embraced that concept. 
  There is, however, a rather serious gripe with Mr Patten. He 
consistently reassured the legislators moved to support his 
reforms that there was no secret deal being hatched in Beijing. 
And he solemnly promised that a "full account" of the failed 17 
rounds of talks with the Chinese would be published so they 
could see that was so. It is a shame that a week such as this 
should be so marred by the decision to publish only a 
"distilled" version of the negotiations. To be precise, the 
document summarises the content of the first 14 rounds of talks 
and then provides a detailed account of the last three. More 
disturbingly, only details of the final negotiating position of 
the British is included in the account of the last three rounds 
of talks. There is not even an intimation of the other options 
put forward but withdrawn or rejected. 
  Mr Patten, who on one hand saw fit to entrust Hong Kong's 
political future in the men and women of Legco, apparently 
decided, as one source suggested, that he did not want to 
"bombard Legco, the British Parliament and the people of Hong 
Kong with a barrage of papers". 
  The MPs in London may have found little to interest them in 
such a pile of documents, but Mr Patten should realise the 
people of Hong Kong would have no objection to being bombarded 
with paper if it is important to their future. And what can be 
more important than the content of secret talks carried out on 
their behalf with their future sovereign country? Surely they 
can decide for themselves whether they want to read the whole 
account or skip parts. An unpleasant suggestion could be 
leveled at the government that rather than "distilling" the 
contents of the rounds of talks, the result may have been to 
dilute or distort them. Furthermore, is not Mr Patten handing a 
propaganda coup to the Chinese? They have already provided a 
partial account of their version of the talks. Now they will 
have the opportunity to provide a fuller account no doubt 
differing from, and taking issue with, that of the British. 
  The unfortunate man in the street will be unable to decide 
which is the correct version. He will be aware, however, that 
the British baulked at giving him a "full accounting". He will 
undoubtedly wonder what has been left out. 
  It is to be hoped that in the days to come, the Chinese will 
accept that Legco carried out what it properly considered to be 
its duty and will react in a calm and thoughtful manner. Let us 
further trust that their response to the British publication of 
their account of the talks will be measured. Mr Patten 
delivered yesterday's document calmly. It was devoid of the 
vitriol or blame that may have been felt as talks ran 
frustratingly foul of success. Now is not the time for more 
bickering, recriminations or retaliation. Time has moved on. 
Hong Kong has moved on.

  [Editorial Report] The following are summaries of media 
reports on economic developments in Hong Kong monitored by Hong 
Kong Bureau between 19 February and 3 March 1994. Source 
information is given in parentheses at the end of each item or 
is provided in the body of the item. 
<H5>  HONG KONG INVESTMENT IN PRC: </H5>
<H5>  Hong Kong Developer in Hubei Real Estate Projects </H5>
  Coastal International Holdings, which has invested HK$4.5 
billion (Hong Kong dollars) in Chinese real estate, will join 
hands with Wuhan City's Urban Construction Commission to develop 
and redevelop 1,000 mu of land on both banks of the Han Shui. 
At present, Coastal International has three projects in Wuhan. 
Two are in real estate and the other is a 400-million-yuan 
project to build three bridges, which are expected to be 
completed before the end of 1995. Involvement in this project 
gave Coastal International the opportunity to participate in the 
redevelopment of urban areas in Hankou and Hanyang, which are 
also in Hubei Province. (Hong Kong HSIN PAO in Chinese 20 Feb 94 
p 2) 
<H5>  Banker Views Effects of Real Estate Tax </H5>
  A series of tax system reforms, including the introduction 
of 
a value-added land tax, which China launched early this year has 
caused varying degrees of confusion which is of concern to the 
banking sector in Hong Kong. Analysts hold that recent changes 
in tax policy will have a great impact on foreign investors and 
have expressed their preference for a relatively long 
consultation and adaptation period, which they believe is 
necessary. 
  Wu Lianfeng, assistant general manager of the Nanyang 
Commercial Bank, noted that China is only now preparing to 
reform its taxation system after more than 10 years of 
implementing the reform and opening up policy. However, he also 
pointed out that the value-added land tax, the consumption tax, 
and other laws and ordinances introduced early this year only 
provide a framework and that many specific procedures need to be 
worked out and improved. He noted that different 
interpretations of the new laws and regulations by the central 
and local governments have already caused a certain degree of 
confusion and disorder in their implementation and have 
disrupted investment projects by foreign businessmen. 
  Chim Pui-chung, a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council 
who represents the banking and finance functional constituency, 
also urged China to give consideration to foreign investors' 
legitimate interests while continuing to exercise macroeconomic 
regulation and control. He warned that as other Asian countries 
were making efforts to improve their investment environment to 
attract foreign investors, China should follow suit; otherwise 
foreign funds could move elsewhere. (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN 
SHE in Chinese 0908 GMT 21 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Jialing To List Subsidiaries in Hong Kong </H5>
  Jialing, a Hong Kong-based company controlled by Sichuan 
Province, is restructuring its subsidiaries in an effort to list 
them on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Recently, Jialing has 
operated as a holding company and has filed an application with 
the mainland authorities to gain commensurate status there. 
Jialing's businesses cover import-export, equity investments in 
industrial and commercial enterprises, real estate investments, 
information services, securities, transportation, hotels, and 
the importation of capital and technology. Last year, 70 
percent of its income came from real estate investments, mostly 
in Hong Kong. According to Jialing's chairman, Liu Guangbing, 
the company will increase investment in the mainland this year. 
(Hong Kong WEN WEI PO in Chinese 23 Feb 94 p C3) 
<H5>  Denway Invests in Auto Component Plants in Guangzhou </H5>
  After investing 60 million yuan in the Guangzhou Battery 
Factory, Hong Kong-listed Denway Investment has announced that 
it will become a major shareholder in the Guangzhou Hua De 
Automobile Spring Company and the Guangzhou Juli Automobile 
Electrical Parts Company, holding 51 percent and 60 percent 
respectively. The joint ventures will produce suspension 
springs and ignition systems. The total value of the deals was 
41.75 million yuan. According to Denway's general manager, Xie 
Gancheng, a feasibility report is being completed on increasing 
the firm's auto output by 100,000 units. At the moment, Denway 
produces 50,000 cars a year. Xie said the reason Denway had 
bought into the components factories was to increase the 
proportion of domestically made components used in its products 
and to supply components to other auto companies in China or to 
overseas buyers. (Hong Kong WEN WEI PO in Chinese 23 Feb 94 p C1) 
<H5>  Hong Kong Firm Invests in Maoming Power Plant </H5>
  Hong Kong-based Chia Ho Ltd. has invested in a power plant 
in 
Guangdong under Maoming City's Electric Development Corporation 
and now holds two thirds of the shares at a cost of HK$23 
million. The term of the partnership is 35 years. This 
four-year-old power plant has eight generating units imported 
from Germany, with an installed capacity of over 50,000 kw. 
(Hong Kong TA KUNG PAO in Chinese 24 Feb 94 p 5) 
<H5>  Cheung Kong Negotiates Shanghai Real Estate Deal </H5>
  Despite his stated concerns over China's new value-added 
land 
tax, Li Ka-shing's main property investment vehicle, Cheung Kong 
Holdings, is planning to enter the Shanghai residential real 
estate market with two projects worth an estimated 2 billion 
yuan. According to Feng Xie Kun, general manager of Shanghai 
Changning Urban Construction and Comprehensive Development 
General, Li is currently negotiating the details of the proposed 
development with the authorities in Shanghai. (Hong Kong EASTERN 
EXPRESS in English 28 Feb 94 p 32) 
<H5>  Stanley Ho Threatens To Halt Mainland Investments </H5>
  Property developer and Macao casino operator Stanley Ho has 
threatened to stop investing in the Chinese real estate market 
if the capital gains tax on property is implemented. Ho issued 
the warning at a foundation-laying ceremony in Shanghai on 26 
February for his Shanghai Plaza development, an office, 
residential, and hotel complex. Shun Tak Holdings, which is 
controlled by Ho, has a 15-percent stake, and one of his private 
companies has 20 percent of the 8-billion-yuan project, which 
comprises five 31-story blocks, a shopping and entertainment 
center, and a five-star hotel. "If the tax is implemented, I 
will not be interested in further investment," Ho said in 
reference to Beijing's new value-added land tax, but he added 
that his existing projects on the mainland would proceed as 
scheduled. (Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 28 Feb 94 p 31) 
<H5>  China Overseas To Invest in Guangdong Power Plant </H5>
  The Hong Kong-listed China Overseas Development Company Ltd, 
a wholly owned subsidiary of China State Construction 
Engineering Corporation, is planning to invest $117 million in a 
thermal power plant project in Shaoguan City, Guangdong 
Province. The plant, Shaoguan City Pingshi Power Plant (B 
Factory), is a joint venture with the Shaoguan City government 
and the Shui Heng Development Company Ltd, who hold 25 percent 
and 22.5 percent respectively. The joint venture has a 20-year 
operating franchise for the plant. (Hong Kong HSIN PAO in 
Chinese 1 Mar 94 p 5) 
<H3>  Mainland Firms Sell Stake in Container Terminal to Swire, 
P&amp;O </H3>
  The China Merchants and Steam Navigation Company and the 
China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) have sold 50 percent of 
their shares in Shekou Container Terminal (SCT) to P&amp;O and 
Hong 
Kong's Swire Group for HK$615 million. From 28 February, SCT 
will be directly managed by the British-owned P&amp;O. A 
spokesman 
for SCT said that the transaction was aimed at introducing 
advanced foreign management and technology to position SCT for 
the development of a market economy. P&amp;O and Swire each hold 
25 
percent and China Merchants and COSCO have 32.5 percent and 17.5 
percent respectively. SCT maintains regular international 
routes connected with mainland ports and can handle 67,000 
containers. (Hong Kong WEN WEI PO in Chinese 2 Mar 94 p A7) 
<H5>  China-Owned Firm Taps Syndicated Loan Market </H5>
  Top Glory Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of the China 
National Cereals, Oils, and Foodstuffs Import and Export 
Corporation (CEROIL), has tapped the Hong Kong syndicated loan 
market for the first time to raise $46 million. Top Glory's 
managing director, Zhou Biquan, said the company had learned to 
use external sources of funds for working capital. Incorporated 
in Hong Kong in 1981, Top Glory's activities span trade and 
shipping, finance, property development, and hotels. Its parent 
company, CEROIL, comes under the jurisdiction of the PRC's 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. Mr. Zhou 
said the funds raised would be used to develop its food business 
in China. The 28-month loan facility, at 1.25 percentage points 
over LIBOR, was arranged by Standard Chartered Asia, and 
co-arranged by Credit Suisse, KEB (Asia) Finance, and Sanwa 
Bank. (Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (BUSINESS POST) in 
English 3 Mar 94 P 1) 
  Swire To Raise Stake in China Coke Venture 
  Swire Pacific has announced plans to reorganize its 
Coca-Cola 
bottling operations in China. Swire and the Coca-Cola company 
have restructured their respective shareholdings in the their 
joint ventures and are developing new bottling operations in 
China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Swire Beverages will hold 100 
percent of Swire Bottlers in Hong Kong and 85 percent of BC 
Development Comapny, the holding company for Coca-Cola bottling 
operations in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Xian. The deal includes an 
agreement in principle for Swire Pacific to be appointed as the 
Coca-Cola bottler in the cities of Zhengzhou and Hefei, which 
would cover Henan and Anhui provinces. Two months ago, Swire 
announced its intention to acquire 25 percent of BC Development 
from China International Trust and Investment Corporation. (Hong 
Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 3 Mar 94 p 26) 
<H5>  PRC INVESTMENT IN HONG KONG: </H5>
  China Overseas Development Company Ltd is expanding its 
property interests in Hong Kong. By late 1993, it had 
participated in 19 projects, investing HK$4.6 billion and 
controlling 4 million square feet of floor space. The president 
of China Overseas said that while Hong Kong remained the focus 
of its real estate development business, the company was 
diversifying, as indicated by its investment in the Shaoguan 
Power Plant project. (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in Chinese 
0734 GMT 1 Mar 94) 
<H5>  OTHER ISSUES: </H5>
<H5>  Taiwanese Investment in Hong Kong Triples in 1993 </H5>
  Statistics released in Taiwan indicate that the gross volume 
of mutual investment between Taiwan and Hong Kong from January 
to November last year amounted to $311 million, with Taiwan's 
investments in Hong Kong totaling $162 million, an increase of 
$103 million over the same period of 1992 or nearly triple that 
of 1992 figure. The Mainland Affairs Committee pointed out that 
the increase was mainly because Taiwan's banking, financial, and 
securities sectors has increased investment in Hong Kong last 
year. In 1993, Hua Nan Commercial Bank and the Bank of Taiwan 
received permission to upgrade their offices in Hong Kong to 
full-branch status, China Trust Bank and the Medium Business 
Bank of Taiwan established offices in Hong Kong, and securities 
broker such as Taiwan Securities, Jih Sheng, and Ching Hua 
started operations in Hong Kong last year. 
  A survey by the Mainland Affairs Committee disclosed that 
some Taiwan-based enterprises plan to list their shares on the 
Hong Kong Stock Exchange, raise capital, or establish holding 
companies in Hong Kong. The committee predicted that Taiwanese 
businessmen will continue to expand their operations in Hong 
Kong. (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese 1142 GMT 28 Feb

  By 5 March, Beijing had approved 7,521 foreign funded 
enterprises of all types with contracted foreign investment of 
$18.5 billion and realized foreign investment of $10.24 billion. 
Hong Kong interests were represented in 3461 enterprises, with

involving 15,000 square meters of land worth approximately $76 
million. The group also plans to invest $230 million to develop 
the Jingan area of Nanli. The total area under construction is 
approximately 106,000 square meters, on which a 800-room 
five-star hotel and a 29-story apartment building will be built, 
with a 36,000-square-meter shopping mall underneath. In 
November 1993, the Kerry Group signed a contract to construct a 
27-story grade-A office building and a 15-story residential 
building in Beili. Nanli and Beili are located at the juncture 
of Nanjing Xilu and Tongren Lu, opposite the Shanghai Commercial 
Plaza and the Portman Shangri-la Hotel. The Nanli project is 
slated for completion in 1998. (Hong Kong TA KUNG PAO in Chinese

  Yao Group To Invest 600 Million Yuan in Sichuan Development 
  The Yao Group is planning to develop 100 hectares of land on 
Fengzhou Island, Leshan City, Sichuan Province. The first phase 
of the project will create a Buddhist cultural zone with 
residences for worshipers, villas, hotels, and apartments. In 
contrast, the second phase will be a modern entertainment zone 
where a recreation center, fun fair, and casino will be built. 
The third phase will be a complex incorporating sports

million yuan. (Hong Kong HSIN PAO in Chinese 11 Mar 94 p 23) 
  Hong Kong-Based Funds Invest in China 
  More investment funds are being established in Hong Kong to 
facilitate investment on the mainland. Taiwan's Jun Tai Group 
and the Shanghai International Trust and Investment Company are 
organizing a "Shanghai Development Fund" with $150 million to 
invest in enterprises in Shanghai; the U.S.-based Boston Pacific 
Technology and Investment Fund is cooperating with financial 
organizations on the mainland to set up funds to invest in 
projects in Shanghai; and the U.S.-based multinational GE 
Financial Services has joined other companies to promote a 
$50-million China Industrial Investment Fund. In addition, a 
China fund aimed at investing in high-tech projects is likely to 
be established this year, while 34 state enterprises and 
financial organizations on the mainland are discussing the idea 
of establishing a "Chinese Enterprises Development Fund" in 
Beijing with a Hong Kong company. (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN 
SHE in Chinese 1020 GMT 15 Mar 94) 
  Li Ka-shing To Invest in Beijing Hotels 
  According to a source in Beijing, Li Ka-shing is negotiating 
to establish joint ventures involving two of Beijing's oldest 
hotels, the Minzu and Yanjing hotels. The Minzu has 600 rooms 
and the Yanjing has 557, and Mr. Li is planning to take a 
substantial equity stake in both hotels, which would be 
refurbished and upgraded. The likely vehicle for the hotel 
projects is the recently established Hutchison International 
Hotels, which comes under the ambit of Mr. Li's Hutchison 
Whampoa conglomerate. (Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA SUNDAY MORNING POST 
(SUNDAY MONEY) in English 13 Mar 94 p 1) 
  Hutchison To Build 12-Billion-Yuan Power Plant in Shenzhen 
  Hutchison Whampoa will build, operate, and transfer a 
thermal 
power plant outside Shenzhen, according to an agreement signed 
with the Shenzhen Electricity Bureau. Total output from the 
first phase of the proposed plant will be 2540 megawatts. 
According to Shenzhen Vice Mayor Li Guangzhen, the Eastern 
Power Plant will be developed in several phases and will involve 
a total investment of 12 billion yuan. Li Guangzhen's 
assistant, Li Jangguo, said an agreement had been signed with 
Hutchison earlier this year and site preparation work had 
already begun. (Hong Kong HONG KONG STANDARD (FINANCIAL REVIEW)

<H5>  PRC IMVESTMENT IN HONG KONG: </H5>
  FEATURE: PRC-Funded Firms Boost Booming Real 
Estate Market 
  As Hong Kong office and residential real estate prices reach 
further heights, with the territory projected to overtake Tokyo 
as the most expensive business center in the world, two Chinese 
officials have voiced concerns over the activities of PRC-funded 
enterprises in the Hong Kong real estate market. 
  On 17 March, EASTERN EXPRESS reports on page 26 that a new 
study by realtor Jones Lang Wootton (JLW) points to further rent 
rises and rising capital values in all areas of the Hong Kong 
real estate market. The report states that with chronic 
shortages of Grade-A office space, especially in Central 
district, and an equally serious supply crunch in terms of 
high-end accommodation to house incoming executives, office and 
residential rents are set to surpass Tokyo. The JLW study says 
commercial and office rents rose 40 percent in 1993 and rose 
another 10 percent in the first two months of 1994. Residential 
rents also surged, with rents rising by between 30 and 70 
percent depending on the quality and location of the 
accommodation. JLW credits mainland-backed investors with a 
23.2-percent share of the HK$57.5 billion of identifiable real 
estate transactions in 1993. 
  The role of PRC-funded firms in stoking the Hong Kong real 
estate market has attracted the scrutiny of Chen Yuan, vice 
president of the People's Bank of China and son of elder leader 
Chen Yun. A report by the Beijing-based press agency ZHONGGUO 
XINWEN SHE at 1442 GMT on 17 March cites Chen Yuan declaring his 
opposition to speculative activities in the market by PRC-funded 
organizations. Highlighting concerns that badly needed capital 
is being diverted from China to earn quick profits in Hong Kong, 
Chen Yuan stated that China faced a shortage of foreign exchange 
and construction capital, and he had a "disapproving attitude" 
towards PRC-funded entities speculating in the Hong Kong real 
estate market. However, Chen Yuan said that it was normal for 
PRC-funded enterprises in Hong Kong to buy office buildings and 
residences for their staff, adding that the Bank of China ran 
its banking business in Hong Kong independently, determining its 
scale of mortgage lending according to the market situation. 
Chen Yuan also noted that the People's Bank of China was not 
paying any special attention to the issue. 
  Meanwhile, Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong 
Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office, has also commented on the role of 
PRC-funded companies in the real estate market. Speaking to a 
group of Hong Kong delegates to the National People's Congress, 
ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in Chinese at 1400 GMT on 17 March reported 
Lu Ping saying that China-funded enterprises should refrain from 
actions detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 
Expanding on this, Lu said that these firms should not engage 
in real estate trading activities and that, as they were using 
state funds, they had an unfair advantage over other market 
players. 
<H5>  OTHER ISSUES: </H5>
  Golden Resources Sets Up Rice Processing Venture in Vietnam 
  Golden Resources Development has taken a 55 percent stake in 
a $10 million joint venture in Vietnam to process and trade 
rice. Hong Kong's biggest rice distributor has signed a 50-year 
joint venture agreement with the four major rice producing 
provinces in Vietnam: Long An, Dong Thap, Tien Giang, and An 
Giang, which together account for 40 percent of the country's 
production. Vietnam's trade representative in Hong Kong, Huynh 
Minh Hue, said the venture was the largest of its kind so far. 
Golden Resources' share of the investment would be used to 
build a processing plant and to provide working capital. The 
managing director of Golden Resources, David Lam, said the 
company hoped to raise the quality of Vietnamese rice, so 
achieving higher prices on the world market. (Hong Kong SOUTH

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  On the basis of the hydropower development trend around the 
world, the Three Gorges Power Plant should be expanded to the 
largest installed capacity allowable after taking the 
compensation effect of the hydropower stations in the upper 
reaches 30 years later. It should generate more power for peak 
shaving and reduce its hours of operation to approximately 
4,000. Individual generator capacity should exceed 800,000 kW. A 
total of 24 units should be installed with a total capacity of 
19.20 MkW; 1.52 MkW higher than that in the validation plan. 
  On 3 April 1992, the Fifth Meeting of the Seventh Plenum of 
the People's Congress passed a historic resolution that included 
the Three Gorges Project in the 10-Year Plan for economic and 
social development. The State Council was authorized to select 
the proper time for its implementation. It approved a validated 
plan with a normal water level of 175 meters that involves 
one-time construction, staged water storage, and continuous 
relocation of people. Nevertheless, the installed capacity of 
the station requires further investigation and discussion. 
<H3>  (1) Discussion on Installed Capacity of the Three Gorges 
Hydropower Project </H3>
  The "Resolution Regarding the Construction of the Three 
Gorges Project" specified that a total of 26 generators with an 
individual capacity of 680,000 kW will be installed. The total 
installed capacity is 17.68 MkW and 84 billion kWh of 
electricity will be generated annually. Total installed capacity 
is determined by the individual unit capacity and number of 
units chosen. The selection of total installed capacity, 
however, has a direct impact on the water energy utilization 
efficiency, economic benefit and overall layout of the pivot. 
The annual and monthly flow and the head height of the water at 
the pivot, reservoir capacity and its regulating behavior 
determines the overall energy specification. Installed capacity 
is determined on the basis of the need of the power grid and 
economic feasibility by using a water utilization rate. 
Installed capacity is also a direct function of operating hours 
per year. It should match the total flow passing through all 
generators up and down the river. 
  Based on the superior central geographic location of the 
Three Gorges Plant and its role in the future national power 
system, as well as on the peak shaving need of the power grid 
10-15 years down the road, the Three Gorges hydropower station 
is designed to operate 4,571 hours per year. This is slightly on 
the high side in reference to the number of yearly operating 
hours of stations already completed or under construction with 
capacity greater than 1 MkW as shown in Table 1.

  From the table, 9 out of 12 power stations have more 
equipment utilization hours than that of the Three Gorges 
hydropower station. About half of them are at approximately 
3,500 hours. The Gezhouba station is apparently operating at a 
high rate. For a power station that does not have much 
regulating capacity, if the number of hours in operation is 
reduced to 4,000 per year, then an additional 1.20 MkW of 
capacity can be installed and the amount of water discharge can 
be substantially decreased. For this reason, all hydropower 
plants around the world are expanding their capacity based on 
the peak shaving requirements of the grid. This can not only 
enhance the peak shaving effect, but can also make full use of 
available water resources to meet seasonal demands without 
discharging or minimizing discharging flood water. In China, in 
order to improve its peak shaving capability, the northeast 
power grid is planning to expand the Fengman station to 1 MkW 
(approximately doubling it in size). Along this line of 
thinking, we are spending billions to construct pumped-storage 
power stations (such as Shisan Ling, Guangxu and Tianhuanging) 
just to solve the peak shaving problem. 
  Premier Li Peng [2621 7720] clearly pointed out in the Three 
Gorges Project Construction Workshop on 19 November that the 
Three Gorges Project must be constructed using means compatible 
with our socialist market economy and managed with modern 
techniques. To expand the installed capacity of the Three Gorges 
Project is to offer its tremendous peak shaving capacity to the 
national power grid. This is in accordance with our socialist 
market economy that will produce great economic benefits. If the 
tiered price structure is expanded nationwide, it will provide 
the force needed to enlarge installed capacity in hydropower 
stations. It also provides a very promising solution to 
resolving our peak demand. We should totally discard the idea 
that a better hydropower plant is one with long operating hours 
and high equipment utilization efficiency. 
  According to an analysis on balanced electric power and 
energy done by the Chang Jiang Committee during the planning 
stage of the project, using the year 2015 as the design target, 
the installed capacity of the Three Gorges is 20.40 million kW. 
The corresponding water utilization coefficient is 94 percent 
and the hours of operation is 4,268. In reference to the overall 
layout of the Three Gorges pivot, it is better to operate the 
power plant at approximately 4,000 hours per year. The 
corresponding installed capacity is 20-21 million kW. If it is 
lowered to 3,500-3,000 hours, then the corresponding installed 
capacity is 24-28 million kW. Without changing the layout, there 
are two major approaches to increase installed capacity. One is 
to increase the individual capacity and the other is to increase 
the number of units. We should consider the double-row layout 
used in Nanchang that adopted the original Russian Tokto-gul 
hydropower station design and the Lijiaxia hydropower station 
under construction on the Huang He. This compact layout is a 
better approach to increase the number of installed units.

  Under the premise that the power plant produces the same 
amount of electric energy, increasing installed capacity and 
lowering yearly hours of operation is the most effective way to 
generate peak power to meet the ever-rising peak-to-valley 
difference in a modern power grid. The Three Gorges is located 
at the center of the national power grid. We should bury steel 
pipes on the south side of the dam to make provision for the 
construction of a third power station in the future. 
<H3>  (2) Discussion on the Selection of Individual Unit Capacity 
for the Three Gorges Hydropower Station </H3>
  The current plan selects a 680,000 kW generator. The major 
advantage is that it can be manufactured domestically. The 
disadvantage is that its capacity is too low and the total 
installed capacity is also too low. The author believes that a 
generator should be selected based on a layout that suits the 
optimal installed capacity. We should also choose a plan that 
employs the most technologically advanced, economically feasible 
unit that would maximize the total installed capacity. We are 
building the largest hydropower plant in the world and we are 
planning to install units at the level of the 1970s. Moreover, 
it is even lower than the individual capacity at the Grand 
Coulee and Itaipu. This is way out of the ordinary. We are 
stressing the fact that we want to be self-sufficient. 
  We need to liberate our thinking and change our concept. The 
selection of individual unit capacity needs to be revalidated 
based on a socialist market economy. Generators that are going 
to be installed over a dozen years down the road ought to be a 
product of the 21st century. We should be ambitious enough not 
only to build the largest hydropower plant in the world but also 
to have world-class individual unit capacity. 
  Several individual unit capacity plans are described in the 
following. Using a turbine diameter of D[.sup]1[/] = 9.5 m, a 
design head of H = 85 m, and a turbine force of N = 6.9 million 
kW, the unit flow of the turbine is calculated to be 
Q'[.sup]1[/] = 1.081 m[.sup]3[/]/s. 
  Given the same H and Q'[.sup]1[/], the values of 
D[.sup]1[/], N and steel pipe diameter D are shown in Table 3.

  To maintain the current layout, the author recommends two 
different plans for the individual unit capacity. 
  The first one is Plan 2 where the turbine diameter is a 
non-standard value of 9.85 m. The output of the turbine is 729 
MW and the generator unit produces 700 MW. This plan ensures 
that the individual unit capacity at the Three Gorges is equal 
to that at two existing famous power plants, i.e., the Itaipu at 
the Brazil-Paraguay border and the Grand Coulee Dam in the 
United States. The number of units remains unchanged and the 
layout does not need to be altered. The total installed capacity 
is 700MW x 26 = 18,200MW, which is 520,000 kW higher than that 
in the validated plan. 
  Second is Plan 5. The turbine diameter is D1 = 10.40 m, the 
turbine output is 824,700 kW and the generator unit output is 
800,000 kW. Because the plan requires the use of a 13.5 m 
diameter pressure steel pipe, the center distance between units 
is increased by 3 m. In order to keep the flood gates and ship 
locks in their original positions, the north and south plants 
need to reduce the number of units by one each, i.e., 13 units 
in the north and 11 in the south. The total number is 24 and the 
overall installed capacity is 800MW x 24 = 19,200MW. It is 
1.52MW larger than that in the validated plan. A station of the 
same length can accommodate 22 0.9MW units with a total 
installed capacity of 19.8 million kW, or 20 1MW units with a 
total installed capacity of 20 million kW. It is obvious that 
installing 0.8MW units is the most effective way to raise the 
overall installed capacity. By the end of this century, China 
should have the capability to manufacture 800MW generator units. 
It is also possible to jointly design and manufacture with 
foreign firms as in the case of the Geheyan hydropower station. 
It also may be possible to solicit international bids for some 
of the units. 
<H5>  (3) Conclusion </H5>
  The Three Gorges hydropower station must take the 
compensating and regulating effect of the hydropower stations 
upstream 30 years from now into account. It must take full 
advantage of its location at the center of national power grid 
and generate as much power for peak shaving as possible. It 
should have the maximum installed capacity possible to enhance 
its peak shaving capability. It is recommended that 24 generator 
units with an individual unit capacity of 800MW be placed. Since 
there is essentially no change in plant length and location, 
there will be minimal change to the water flow downstream. The 
diameter of the steel pipe is increased by 10 percent to 13.5 m. 
The increase in difficulty to manufacture should be easy to 
handle. Our hydropower experts, scholars and colleagues should 
revalidate the individual unit capacity and unit number based on 
the new socialist market economy. There is still time to change 
the design. 
  Despite the fact that two 170,000 kW units were successfully 
tested at the Erjiang station of Gezhouba, the Dajiang station 
refused to use it. Instead, it is still using the smaller 
125,000 kW unit. The consequences are that it is wasting water 
100 days a year. Hopefully, this will not happen at the Three 
Gorges. 
  The plan to install 24 800MW units at the Three Gorges is of 
vital importance.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  Water flow in the Jinsha Jiang is abundant and steady. The 
drop is huge and concentrated. A total of 75.12 million kW of 
installed capacity is possible, capable of producing 355.5 
billion kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds 
respectively to 20 and 19 percent of the capacity and power 
production to be developed nationally. It is the most 
concentrated water resource in the world. In the past, this 
"lode" was not developed due to its geographic location and 
regional economy. As our economy grows, speeding up the 
development of the Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Base will have a 
major effect on alleviating the severe power shortage in the 
southeast, improving our energy structure, industrial structure, 
and ecology in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang, and 
promoting economic growth in southwest and southeast China. 
  In response to a recommendation made by the Southern 
Electric 
Utility Corporation, the China Electric Power Association and 
the China Society of Hydropower Engineering organized a visit to 
the middle and lower reaches of the Jinsha Jiang. Experts and 
top officials of different departments from the central, 
regional and provincial government and in the area of survey and 
design, participated in this effort. The primary purpose of the 
visit was to invite our comrades from the southeast, where a 
severe energy shortage exists, to take a first-hand look at the 
energy resources available on the Jinsha Jiang and to explore 
the possibility to jointly develop this resource to supply 
electric power from west to east. 
<H5>  (I) Jinsha Jiang Resources Are Abundant and Easy To Develop </H5>
  The Jinsha Jiang is a branch of the upper reaches of the 
Chang Jiang and flows from Yushu, Qinghai, to Yibin, Sichuan. It 
flows through Qinghai, Xizang, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and is 2,290 
kilometers long. It covers a basin of more than 490,000 
km[.sup]2[/]. The flow is abundant and steady and the head is 
huge and concentrated. The average flow is 4,920 
m[.sup]3[/]/s and the mean annual discharge is 155 billion 
m[.sup]3[/]. There is not much fluctuation in the annual 
discharge. The ratio of the wettest to the driest year is merely 
1.38. The main stream has a drop of 3,280 m and the mean drop is 
1.43 percent. It can accommodate a total installed capacity of 
75.12 million kW and produce 355.5 billion kWh of electricity 
per year, corresponding to 20 percent of the capacity to be 
developed nationwide and 19 percent of the electricity to be 
generated. The amount of electric power generated per year is 
equivalent to 128 million tons of standard coal. It will play a 
pivotal role in balancing our primary energy resources. It ranks 
first in the world in terms of abundance and concentration of 
hydropower resource. 
  The middle and lower section of the Jinsha Jiang, from Shigu 
to Yibin, is the focus of research and development. After 
repeated surveys, proofs of concept, and planning in the past 30 
years, according to the "Briefing on Comprehensive Utilization 
of the Chang Jiang Basin Plan" and the development plans 
prepared by the Kunming Institute and the Chengdu Institute, the 
middle and lower reaches of the Jinsha Jiang can be developed in 
10 stages. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the cascade 
development. Figure 2 shows the cross-section view of the 
cascade development. Major specifications of the power stations 
are shown in the table. After additional surveys and studies 
done in 1992, the Kunming Institute proposed to build at 
Jinanqiao instead of Zhili and at Yanke instead of Hongmenkou. 
The accompanying table illustrates that this development project 
will result in tremendous benefits.

<H5>  1. Tremendous Power Generating Capability </H5>
  On the basis of the plan that the water level at the 
Hutiaoxia Reservoir is 1,950 m, 51.98-58.58 million kW of 
generators can be installed to produce 263.7-275.4 billion kWh 
of electricity annually. If the 2,012 m scheme proposed by the 
Kunming Institute is adopted, an extra 1.5 million kW of 
generator capacity can be installed at the Upper and Lower 
Hutiaoxia hydropower stations and an additional 11 million kW of 
capacity can be built downriver to produce an extra 21 billion 
kWh of electricity a year. 
<H5>  2. Excellent Regulating Effect </H5>
  The "spigot" reservoir at Upper Hutiaoxia and two additional 
huge reservoirs at Baijidu and Xiluodu will regulate the river 
flow to ensure good power-generating quality. 
<H5>  3. Good Overall Benefits </H5>

  The development will also result in other benefits such as 
flood control, silting, irrigation, navigation and soil 
preservation. 
<H5>  4. Better Geologic Condition </H5>
  Although the region is frequently struck by earthquakes, 
dams 
can be built in relatively stable sites with better geologic 
conditions. Each cascade has the geologic condition to build a 
tall dam. 
<H5>  5. Superior Technoeconomic Indicators </H5>
  The hydropower station at each cascade has superior 
technoeconomic indicators such as the amount of engineering 
work, construction cost, flooding loss, and population 
relocation. 
<H3>  6. Major Improvements in Transportation at Most Hydropower 
Station Sites </H3>
  National or provincial highways pass through sites such as 
the Upper Hutiaoxia, Jinanqiao, Guanyinyan, Xiluodu, and 
Xiangjiaba. Lower Hutiaoxia and Baihetan are accessible by local 
roads. In addition, most hydropower station sites are located 
near towns and villages. 
<H3>  (II) Development of the Jinsha Jiang Has Major Strategic 
Significance </H3>
<H3>  1. Deliver Electricity From West to East To Alleviate Energy 
Shortage in the Southeast </H3>
  Energy resources are in short supply in the eastern, central 
and southern regions. The shipping of coal produced in the north 
to the south puts a tremendous strain on transportation. With 
sustained economic growth, there is a rising demand for energy 
and electricity. If we continue to rely upon coal alone, it will 
be difficult for our production and transportation system to 
meet our demand. Pollution is a major problem and it is 
impossible to build a large number of costly nuclear power 
plants to solve our energy shortage problem. The abundant water 
energy resource in the southwest, especially the delivery of 
electric power generated from the Jinsha Jiang eastward, is an 
important energy resource for the southeast. On the basis of our 
analysis, if the cascades of the Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Project 
are completed in 2040, 50 million kW of power can be supplied to 
the east. This will have a major impact on alleviating the 
energy shortage and improving the primary energy structure in 
the southeast. 
<H3>  2. Developing Hydropower To Lead Economic Growth in the 
Southwest </H3>
  Since the reform, although there has been some economic 
growth along the Jinsha Jiang, with the exception of a few 
cities such as Panzhihua and Yibin, the growth is still very 
slow, particularly in minority areas. Nevertheless, there is an 
abundance of hydropower, mineral and biomass resources. Speeding 
up the work to develop the Jinsha Jiang can drive up the 
development of other natural resources in the region and improve 
the local economy and cultural standard. It will convert its 
resource advantage to economic advantage and can improve the 
layout of our industrial structure. Developing the Jinsha Jiang 
can also improve the ecology in the upper reaches of the Chang 
Jiang. In addition, it will bring a fortune to our minorities. 
This helps solidify us as a nation to secure our southwestern 
border. It carries a great deal of political and economic 
significance. 
<H3>  3. Development of the Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Base Will Make 
the Three Gorges More Economically Beneficial </H3>
  The completion of the Jinsha Jiang cascades will produce a 
total water storage capacity of 77 billion m[.sup]3[/], a 
regulating capacity of 36 billion m[.sup]3[/], and some flood 
control capacity. By regulating the reservoirs, the flow 
downstream will increase in the dry season and decrease during a 
flood. Furthermore, it will also block sand from washing down 
the river. 
  (1) After the Xiluodu reservoir is constructed, by way of 
regulating the flow, the city of Yibin will have the capability 
to deal with a 100-year flood, instead of the current 20-year 
flood. In addition, it can also reduce the flow of floodwater 
into the Three Gorges to improve its flood control capability. 
  (2) After the Xiluodu reservoir is completed, the dam will 
block the movement of suspended material from upstream. In 30 
years, it can intercept 67 percent of the suspending materials, 
the equivalent to reducing the suspension at Yichang by 30 
percent. As a result, it will slow down the rise of flood levels 
at the end of the Three Gorges caused by silting. 
  (3) According to an analysis done by the Chengdu Institute, 
regulation provided by the Xiluodu reservoir can produce an 
additional 880,000 kW of capacity to the hydropower stations at 
Xiangjiaba, Three Gorges, and Gejiaba and generate 1.6 billion 
kWh of electricity per year. 
  (4) By the regulating power of the Xiluodu reservoir, the 
minimum flow during drought season can be increased from 1,060 
m[.sup]3[/]/s to 2,000 m[.sup]3[/]/s to improve the 
navigation conditions down the Jinsha Jiang and along the upper 
reaches of the Chang Jiang. 
<H3>  (III) Progress in Early Stage Work on Jinsha Jiang 
Hydropower Base </H3>
  1. Hutiaoxia Cascade. The Hutiaoxia gorge is approximately 
22 
km in length and has a 200 m drop. It has numerous shoals and 
rapids and steep cliffs on both banks. Most exposed rocks are 
marble and quartzite. Some geologic survey and planning work was 
done by the Chang Jiang Water Conservancy Commission in the 
1960s. The South China Institute has established a hydrology 
station at the Longpanba site in Hutiaoxia to conduct planning 
stage survey work. As for the development of Hutiaoxia, the 
schemes studied in the past include a two-stage approach, 
building two tall dams at upper and lower Hutiaoxia, and a 
hybrid approach, building a tall dam at upper Hutiaoxia and 
leading water from the right shore to a power plant in lower 
Hutiaoxia. Specifically, with reference to the fact that the 
original upper Hutiaoxia dam site is too narrow, designers also 
proposed to move the dam upstream to Longpan where the river is 
wide. These approaches are being studied as a part of the 
planning work. 
  Normal water level should be selected primarily based on 
Yunnan's ability to absorb flooding of farmland and relocation 
of people. Presently, Yunnan is leaning toward a high water 
level plan. This not only can generate more electricity along 
different stages but also can bring water to irrigate 
approximately 1.2 million mu of farmland in central Yunnan. 
These are issues to be investigated in the planning stage. The 
next step is to study and demonstrate the scale and method of 
development at Hutiaoxia and to determine the normal water level 
in the Upper Hutiaoxia reservoir. This front end work needs to 
be accelerated to ensure that it plays a "lead" role after 
hydropower stations at Xiangjiaba and Xiluodu are put on line. 
  2. Jinanqiao Cascade. With the support of Yunnan, on the 
basis of a comparison of terrain, geology, transportation, and 
construction conditions, the Kunming Institute proposed to 
replace Zhili with Jinanqiao. It has also completed a planning 
survey. The dam site is primarily covered with dense basalt and 
a small amount of tuff. It is a better site. The station is to 
be built behind the dam. Initially, a 2.5 million kW station 
with a guaranteed production of 1.273 million kW is planned. The 
scale appears to be appropriate. If possible, this early stage 
development proposal by Yunnan should be supported. 
  3. Guanyinyan Cascade. This dam site, primarily covered by 
quartzite and silt, will be developed with a power plant behind 
the dam. The Kunming Institute has completed the planning survey 
work. The plant is of an appropriate size and has the necessary 
conditions for development. The city of Panshihua hopes that 
construction can begin as soon as possible. Regardless which one 
of the three proposed sites is chosen, Huaping County in Yunnan 
will be flooded by the reservoir. A comprehensive technoeconomic 
analysis should be done in the early stage to choose the most 
appropriate site. 
  4. Baihetan Cascade. As early as the 1950s, under extremely 
difficult circumstances, the Kunming Institute conducted survey 
and design work with experts from Czechoslovakia on this site. 
The East China Institute has built roads and erected cable 
bridges to conduct surveys for the planning stage. This site is 
primarily covered with hard basalt. It stands on solid bedrock 
that offers an excellent geologic condition. Other conditions 
for development are also outstanding. It is a key project to 
deliver electric power from the Jinsha Jiang eastward. Moreover, 
it regulates the flow downstream at Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba. 
  5. Xiluodu Cascade. Here, the river channel is straight in a 
V-shaped valley. Bedrock, mostly basalt, is exposed on either 
bank. It is hard and solid. Geologically, it is perfect for the 
construction of a tall dam and underground buildings. Developing 
conditions such as construction and transportation are good. 
Xiluodu is the largest hydropower station on the Jinsha Jiang. 
Its reservoir has the ability to regulate the river flow year 
round. The Chengdu Institute has conducted a great deal of 
survey and design work for several years. If the front-end cost 
is assured, a dam site selection report can be prepared by the 
end of 1993. A feasibility report can be finished in 1995. 
Development of Xiluodu is an ideal first phase project for the 
delivery of electricity from the Jinsha Jiang eastbound. Local 
global governments want an early development. 
  6. Xiangjiaba Cascade. The Chengdu Institute began site 
surveys in 1975. These were followed by geological surveys done 
by the Wujing Hydropower Survey Team. In 1985, the design survey 
responsibility was switched to the South China Institute. In 
1990, the Institute of Water Conservancy held a site selection 
meeting for the dam. Site VII is preferred and site III is the 
alternate. The dam site base is sandstone. The South China 
Institute is working on the hub layout at the selected site, 
performing hydraulic model experiments, conducting geologic 
survey work, and mapping navigation channels. This station has 
the best conditions for construction and transportation. In 
addition, cities such as Yinbin and Shuifu are close by. The 
overall benefit of the power station is substantial. 
Furthermore, it works as a reverse regulating reservoir for the 
Xiluodu hydropower station. It will benefit both the power grid 
and navigation. If the preliminary phase funding can be secured, 
a feasibility report may be completed in 1984. 
  Xiangjiaba and Xiluodu are sister power stations. They 
should 
be included in the first phase of construction on the lower 
reaches of the Jinsha Jiang. 
<H3>  (IV) Preliminary Understanding of the Development of the 
Jinsha Jiang </H3>
  Since the 1950s, organizations such as the Chang Jiang Water 
Conservancy Commission, Kunming Institute, Chengdu Institute, 
South China Institute, East China Institute, and the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences have conducted a great many surveys and 
planning and design work on the Jinsha Jiang and acquired a 
tremendous amount of data. In 1981, the Chengdu Institute 
prepared a plan to develop the lower reaches. Since feasibility 
studies of Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba are in progress, as time goes 
by, many new findings will surface. As for the middle reaches, 
the Kunming Institute is conducting full-scale planning work. 
The survey and design work in the planning stage for the 
Hutiaoxia cascade is being conducted by the South China 
Institute. In recent years, the China Electric Power Association 
and the China Society of Hydropower Engineering have also done a 
great deal of work on the development of the Jinsha Jiang. The 
following is a discussion on strengthening the early-stage 
effort. 
<H5>  1. Sticking to a Basic Construction Process </H5>
  We must stick to a basic construction process despite the 
fact that our economy is growing at a fast pace and the depth of 
reform is getting deeper. Preparation of a hydropower planning 
report is an important stage. It determines the scope, phases 
and sequence (selection of first stage work) of the development 
effort. It is the foundation required for a feasibility study of 
every hydropower station. We must do a good job to prepare a 
hydropower planning report for the middle and lower reaches of 
the Jinsha Jiang. 
<H5>  2. Study Major Technoeconomic Issues in Depth </H5>
  The Jinsha Jiang is China's largest hydropower base. We must 
rigorously perform the front-end preparation work and study 
related major technoeconomic issues in great detail. 
  (1) On the basis of the overall development plan of the 
Chang 
Jiang Basin, the Jinsha Jiang is supposed to be developed for 
hydropower, navigation, irrigation, water supply, and flood 
control for areas downriver. There are different requirements 
for the different cascades. Various industries also have 
different requirements for the development of the Jinsha Jiang. 
Some of them are extremely demanding. It makes the planning and 
early stage work very difficult. 
  (2) Although there is an abundance of resources along the 
Jinsha Jiang, there is only a limited amount of land available 
for development. This makes the relocation of people more 
difficult. Furthermore, the region belongs to minorities. We 
must clearly understand the degree of difficulty in relocating 
the population. 
  (3) The Jinsha Jiang valley is narrow and the river is 
swift. 
It also contains a great deal of mud and sand. The riverbed has 
a thick overburden layer. It is located in a high earthquake 
frequency zone. In addition, there are problems such as high 
slopes and reservoir bank stability. Individual reservoirs may 
leak. These natural conditions make the engineering design and 
construction more difficult. 
  (4) From the standpoint of the scale of the project, all 
hydropower stations are more than 2 million kW. Technical 
requirements for tall dams are very stringent. Many issues such 
as tall dam construction, high capacity water turbine 
generators, ultrahigh voltage power transmission technology and 
diversion in high-flow situations must be investigated. Some 
issues may require considerable development. 
<H3>  (V) Suggestions on Accelerating Jinsha Jiang Hydropower 
Development </H3>
  The rapid growth of our economy, particularly in the 
southeast, presents an urgent need to resolve the power shortage 
problem. Developing the Jinsha Jiang is a way to actually 
deliver electricity to the east. Moreover, development of the 
Jinsha Jiang is an important component in the control and 
development of the Chang Jiang and the economic strip along the 
Chang Jiang. To this end, the author has the following 
suggestions. 
  1. Stronger Government Leadership. Development of the Jinsha 
Jiang is a strategic project that will have a significant impact 
on the economy. It should be treated as serious as the project 
to divert water to the north from the south. Under the guidance 
of the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Electric 
Power Industry, a Jinsha Jiang development office should be 
established to study major policy issues such as hydropower 
development schemes, capital-raising approaches, electricity 
pricing policy, rights and benefits related to provinces that 
own the resources and those that consume power (plus power 
station ownership and distribution of benefits of hydropower 
stations bordering two or more provinces), and shouldering 
investments for overall utilization, and provide its finding to 
the government in the decision-making process. 
  2. Expanded Publicity. In order to accelerate the Jinsha 
Jiang, the project should be more aggressively promoted through 
a variety of channels by different means to make more people in 
more departments and industries aware of the significance of 
building a hydropower energy base in the southwest to allow the 
appropriate authorities and departments to adopt the necessary 
economic, legal and administrative measures to help implement 
and support this project. This will bring more organizations and 
more people to support the development of hydropower along the 
Jinsha Jiang. 
  3. Securing Early Stage Funding. The scale of the project to 
build the Jinsha Jiang hydropower stations is enormous. There 
will be a great deal of work at the front end for a considerable 
period of time. If construction is to begin in the year 2000, 
early stage work should start now, otherwise it will be too 
late. It will seriously impact the development effort. To 
accelerate the development of the Jinsha Jiang, the focus now is 
to begin early stage planning work of key hydropower stations 
and sites along the river. To speed up this early stage work, we 
need to increase the level of funding. The Planning and Design 
Academy is very much concerned about the early stage work for 
the Jinsha Jiang project and has scheduled several design units 
to get involved in the early stage work on the river sections 
and hydropower stations at Xiangjiaba and Xiluodu. Nevertheless, 
progress is hampered due to a severe shortage of funds. To solve 
this problem, a special request was submitted to the State 
Planning Commission, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and 
the National Energy Resources Investment Corporation. In 
addition, based on the principle of a market economy, the 
authority should negotiate with the electric utilities in 
central, eastern and southern China to invest in the project for 
future consumption in order to raise money to cover the front 
end work and the construction cost. 
  Furthermore, the suggestion that the Three Gorges 
Development 
Corporation invests in the Jinsha Jiang project should also be 
followed up and nailed down. Upon completion of the Three Gorges 
project, it is a natural for the cooperation to immediately 
develop the Jinsha Jiang. If this suggestion is accepted, early 
stage funding will be secured and ownership of the project will 
be clear. It will further facilitate the progress of early stage 
work. 
  Under the premise of increased funding, through strengthened 
leadership and coordination, requirements on quality and 
progress can be further defined. Different tasks can then be 
assigned and various units can relatively quickly produce 
quality planning design reports. If funding cannot be increased, 
then all our efforts on proof of concept and schemes will be in 
vain. 
  4. Speeding Up the Planning Report. This report should 
include details such as voltages of eastbound electricity, stage 
development plan, and development sequence. It should be 
officially reviewed by the government to serve as the basis for 
the design of various stages of hydropower stations. It should 
be pointed out that an approved river hydropower planning report 
is a necessity to attract capital from other provinces and 
countries. 
  Development of the Jinsha Jiang is a monumental task that is 
going to take place between this and the next century. As long 
as the government provides stronger leadership, increases the 
level of funding for early stage work, relies on science and 
technology, takes control over planning and design, formulates 
appropriate policies, and obeys the principle of a socialist 
market economy in raising construction capital, there is a 
possibility that the Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Base project may 
start in 2000. By 2010, electricity will be transmitted 
eastward. The Jinsha Jiang Hydropower Base will be completed by 
2040.

Xiang Rong [7639 2837]: "River Successfully Blocked at Ertan 
Hydroelectric Station Site] 
  [Excerpts] Panzhihua, 10 Dec -- Today the river was 
successfully blocked at the site of the Ertan hydroelectric 
power plant paving the way for next year's pouring of concrete 
for the main dam. 
  Located 46 km from Panzhihua city, the Ertan hydroelectric 
station is a key construction project of the Eighth 5-Year Plan. 
It is China's first superlarge hydroelectric power station, 
whose installed capacity will reach 3.3 million kW. The dam will 
be 240 meters high and the annual output of electricity will be 
17 billion kWh. Six hydraulic turbine generating units, each 
with a capacity of 550,000 kW, will be installed in an 
underground powerhouse on the left bank of the river. The Ertan 
hydroelectric station is being built as a joint investment by 
the central and local authorities with loans from the World 
Bank. Bids were solicited internationally for the entire main 
project, and item management was conducted in accordance with 
international practices, so that the project marks a milestone 
in China's power construction. The static investment authorized 
by the state was 10.5 billion yuan, and the dynamic investment 
will reach 21.0 billion yuan. After the station is completed and 
put into operation, in addition to the standard loan repayment 
procedure, an average of 700 million yuan in profit taxes will 
be paid annually, and about 500 million yuan in funds will be 
accumulated for use in Sichuan's hydroelectric power development.

  [Text] Haikou, 18 Jan -- The Hainan Provincial Electric 
Power Bureau and Daguangba Power Plant Construction Directorate 
jointly announced that the No. 1 unit of the Daguangba water 
conservancy and hydropower hub project -- a key "Eighth 5-Year 
Plan" project -- passed examination and acceptance, and formally 
joined the grid on 29 December 1993. The unit has been 
functioning normally. 
  The Daguangba water conservancy and hydropower hub project, 
located on the mainstream of the Changhua Jiang in Dongfang 
County in western Hainan Province, will be used for power, 
irrigation, flood control and tourism, and will generate 520 
million kWh per year, irrigate 995,000 mu of land, and will have 
a 1.7 billion cubic meter reservoir. 
  When completed, this project will alleviate the electric 
power bottleneck on Hainan, and will have great significance for 
the economic development of western Hainan. 
  Although the installed capacity and output of this project 
will be in the lower range of large-size plants, its 
construction will provide valuable experience in terms of new 
technology in design and construction.

  [Text] In 1993, China's newly installed hydroelectric 
capacity set a record (for any single year), breaking the 3 
million kilowatt barrier. 
  Up to 25 December 1993, 12 generators larger than 200MW (and 
with a total installed capacity of 3.0225 million kilowatts) had 
gone into service. This exceeded the State Plan, which called 
for 11 units with a combined capacity of 2.77 million kilowatts. 
Added to this are local small and medium hydroelectric 
generators, which put China in second place in the world (behind 
Brazil) for newly installed hydro capacity, exceeding that of 
the United States, the former Soviet Union, and Canada.

  [Text] In mid-January, a meeting to solicit bids on the 
main body of the Three Gorges project was held in Yichang, Hubei 
Province. This round of bidding involved the left bank phase 
one, section one C2-1 bid (the permanent ship locks), the C3-1 
bid (temporary locks and ship-raising machinery), and the C4-1 
bid (the initial excavation work for the dam and power station). 
  It has been reported that bidding was hot and heavy among 
the 
first-round competitors, who included the Gezhouba Engineering 
Bureau and other elite hydropower construction units. The 
quoted low for the permanent ship lock was 280 million yuan and 
the high was 490 million yuan. The quoted low for the temporary 
ship lock was more than 340 million yuan and the high was more 
than 760 million yuan. For the left bank dam and six 
powerhouses, the low bid was more than 49 million yuan and the 
high bid was more than 100 million yuan. 
  It was further reported that a decision on the first-round 
bidding would be made before 10 February and that work would 
begin in March.

  [Excerpt] Nanning (Xinhua)--Construction is due to start on 
the Longtan hydroelectric power station, on the Hongshui River 
in Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  Cheng Kejie, chairman of the region, told reporters that the 
hydropower station is believed to be second only to the 
projected Three Gorges hydropower station in scale, and when it 
is completed it will be the second biggest in Asia. 
  During the first-phase construction, a water control dam 
with 
a height of 375 metres will be built, and seven generating units 
with a total generating capacity of 4.2 million kilowatts will 
be installed. 
  When the first phase is completed the hydropower station 
will 
be able to generate 15.67 billion killowatt-hours of electricity 
a year, Cheng said. 
  During the second-phase construction, two more generating 
units, to boost the station's aggregate generating capacity to a 
total of 5.4 million kilowatts, will be installed. 
  The entire project will require a total investment of 30 
billion yuan ($3.4 billion), of which $970 million will be 
provided in the form of World Bank loans, the chairman said.

<F P=106> [Article by Xie Songxin] </F>
  [Text] Five foreign companies yesterday signed the first 
contracts to supply construction equipment to the giant Three 
Gorges hydro-electric power project on the Yangtze River. 
  The companies--Caterpillar and Ingersoll Rand of the United 
States, Atlas Copco of Sweden, and Fried Krupp and Mannesman 
Demag of Germany--will provide $10 million worth of earth-moving 
equipment, said officials with the China National Machinery 
Import and Export Corporation (CMC). 
  The five suppliers were selected through public bidding held 
a month ago by CMC and China National Technical Import and 
Export Corporation. 
  The drills, bulldozers, cranes and excavators are to be 
delivered before June. 
  Xiao Chongqian, a senior manager with the Yichang-based 
China 
Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, said negotiations 
for another batch of contracts covering the supply of similar 
equipment worth $20 million were now going on. 
  The Three Gorges project will build the largest 
hydroelectric 
power station and dam in the world at a cost of nearly 100 
billion yuan ($11.5 billion). It will affect about 12 million 
residents on the middle reaches of the Yangtze and take 17 years 
to finish. 
  Construction started last year, and Xiao expects 20 million 
cubic metres of earth will be shifted this year. 
  As the project grows so does the demand for equipment, said 
Xiao. 
  The project has already sparked fierce competition for 
contracts among foreign manufacturers and suppliers. 
  Xiao said billions of dollars worth of equipment will be 
bought abroad for the project. And the purchases will be made by 
different means as the project moves along. 
  After the earthmovers, China will start to buy concrete and 
sand processing equipment and large plant, Xiao said. 
  His company is now looking for foreign partners willing to 
help Chinese companies make dump trucks in the country. 
  "We want the Three Gorges Project to bring on the 
development 
of Chinese industries by using foreign technology instead of 
merely buying equipment from foreign manufacturers," Xiao said. 
  In addition, his company is seeking foreign funds, including 
export credits and other foreign government loans, to pay for 
the equipment. 
  China is also looking for international help to design and 
produce the huge generators for the Three Gorges Project. 
  The plans include 26 water turbines with an installed 
capacity of 700,000 kilowatts each. They will be among the 
biggest in the world. 
  To encourage international cooperation, a month-long 
symposium was held late last year, with more than 90 Chinese and 
foreign experts taking part. 
  Many leading foreign companies with experience of building 
generators with a capacity of 600,000 kilowatts and more were 
represented. 
  They included the Volth and Siemens companies of Germany, GE 
of Canada, Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsui of Japan, and LMZ and 
Electrical of Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Chang Weimin: "Energy Group Eyes More Funds"] </F>
  [Text] The China Huaneng Group, a prototype for Chinese 
State-run enterprises, has launched an ambitious overseas 
expansion. 
  Wang Chuanjian, president of the $5.2-billion enterprise 
group, yesterday said his firm will try every means to attract 
funds from overseas. 
  The group needs investment equal to 100 billion yuan ($11.5 
billion) in the next eight years, Wang said. 
  Wang made the remarks in a speech at the opening session of 
a 
five-day board meeting to plan this year's work. The meeting 
started yesterday in Beijing. 
  The group, established in 1988 with support from the central 
government, has used 33 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) for projects 
in power generating, coal mining and transportation, raw 
material production and other businesses. 
  More than 30 percent of the investment came from overseas, 
mainly in terms of foreign government loans and export credits. 
  Earlier, he said the group planned to install power 
generators with a 15-million-kilowatt capacity by 2000. 
  The group also expects to produce 30 million tons of quality 
coal annually by then. 
  Wang boasted of the group's ties with many foreign firms and 
governments as well as international financial organizations, 
saying it will diversify its fundraising channels. 
  "Foreign government loans and export credits are not enough. 
The group must have more ways to get overseas funds," he said. 
  The president hoped to see more joint ventures, cooperative 
projects and leasing business with foreign partners. 
  Wang urged senior officials in the group's subsidiaries to 
kick off preparations for an investment guide as soon as 
possible. 
  Huaneng now runs more than 30 ventures with foreign firms. 
  The group produced 69 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 
or 8.4 percent of the country's total, and several million tons 
of quality coal, in 1993. 
  This year the group plans to produce 76 billion 
kilowatt-hours of electricity. That represents a growth of 10 
percent--higher than the country's other power generating 
enterprises. 
  An ambitious development programme for the next eight years 
has been approved by the central government, Wang said. 
  However, the president added the group's main challenge is 
raising the funds required for its goals. 
  By 1993, the group had installed 14.12 million kilowatts of 
generators, or 7.8 percent of China's total. 
  In addition, it has built facilities to produce and 
transport 
10 million tons of quality coal annually. 
  In 1993, 5 billion yuan ($575 million) was used to install 
generators to produce 1.63 million kilowatts and construct a 
large coal production base in Shaanxi Province and Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  Huaneng, as a result of all these achievements, is 
recognized 
in the country as a most efficient enterprise group. 
  Its operation system, flexible and adaptable to the market 
economy, is regarded as the key factor in its success over the 
past five years. 
  The group made profits of 4.9 billion yuan ($563 million) in 
1993. Of that, 3.5 billion ($402 million) were used to pay loans.

  [Text] Recently the Dongfang Turbine Plant in Sichuan 
formally began experimental manufacture of the first 
Sino-Japanese designed 600MW turbogenerator, the largest piece 
of thermal power equipment in China. The production of this 
equipment marks China's entry into products for the coming 
century. 
  In order to stand tall in a fiercely competitive market, 
this 
plant set its sights on the world's best and relentlessly went 
after high-capacity, low-consumption, and high-level 
turbogenerator products, and set a new pattern for product 
development. During the "Seventh 5-Year Plan" alone the factory 
manufactured over 20 new products, including 50MW, 200MW, and 
300MW turbogenerators which have been a boon to industry and are 
well regarded both at home and abroad. Thereafter, the plant 
leadership realized that to keep up with the rapidly growing 
economy the country would need even bigger and better thermal 
power equipment, and looking ahead to the next century, they 
joined with the Hitachi Corporation in 1991 to design and 
produce a 600MW turbogenerator. 
  Undaunted by the size and the cost of the task, the plant 
rounded up a large task force, materials and money, and got into 
the development and research manufacture of the "600MW unit." 
Early last year, a "600MW office" composed of the best people, 
was set up, and they completed the conceptual design and made 
changes to the large and sophisticated Hitachi blueprints, 
grappled with the design, process and raw materials, made four 
adjustments to the new contract grid plan, and improved the 
technical training of plant personnel. The plant is now fully 
prepared for the trial production of the 600MW turbogenerator, 
which will be the factory's ticket for entry into the coming 
century.

[5643 6906 2494]] 
  [Text] The so-called "spigot" project for the national key 
industry and mining development zone in Shanxi, the Liulin power 
plant, has been approved for construction by the State Council. 
The Provincial Electric Power Bureau Chief, Bian Xuehai, went to 
the worksite to present the approval report, and to work with 
the Luliang Prefecture Committee and Administrative Office, and 
the Liulin County Committee and County Government to implement 
the Provincial Committee and Government directive on "Key 
Projects and Breakthroughs." The Province, Prefecture, and 
County have joined in a campaign to assemble the manpower, 
materials, and money to start generating power in 1995. 
  The Liliu coal field, a "national treasure" renowned for the 
volume, accessibility, and quality of its coal, couldn't be 
developed on a large scale because of shipping and mobilization 
limitations. The Ministry of Energy Resources and central and 
provincial experts have done numerous studies and have lobbied 
for the construction of a large-scale power plant within the 
mining zone. After the Provincial Committee and Government 
proposed the strategic policy of "putting power transmission and 
coal transportation on equal footing," the central government 
decided to list it, and it also caught the attention and the 
support of the Asian Bank. The project, which is designed for a 
scale of 1200MW at a total investment of 4.1 billion yuan, is to 
be completed by the end of the century. The scale of the first 
stage will be 200MW, which will be completed and operating in 
1995, generating 1.4 billion kWh per year. It will use 3.6 
million tons of secondary raw coal, will generate 46.4 million 
yuan in profit taxes, and the total investment is estimated to 
be 650 million yuan. Bank loans will amount to US$65 million, 
and the State Energy Investment Corporation will loan 60 million 
yuan. It will be one of China's 26 large-size power plants, and 
one of the four large power plants in the province, after 
Shentou and Yangcheng. Once built, the Liliu mining district's 
output of raw coal can increase from the current 9.14 million 
tons per year to 14 million by 1995, with an annual increase in 
social benefits of over 200 million yuan. 
  To guarantee meeting the construction schedule, officials of 
the State Planning Commission, Ministry of Energy Resources, and 
the Provincial Committee and Government have made repeated 
visits to the work site, and the Luliang Prefecture Committee 
and executive offices as well as the Liulin County Committee and 
Government together have solved the funding, technical, 
material, labor, and land acquisition problems. By 10 December, 
the provincial and local electric power foundations came up with 
the needed 240 million yuan, acquired the 825 mu of land, a full 
line of facilities, and the engineering bids. The infrastructure 
requirements and grading of the site are basically completed.

  [Text] On 21 November, the 200-kilowatt No. 1 generator of 
Sichuan's Huangjuezhuang power plant--a major construction 
project of the Eighth Five-Year Plan--joined the grid for the 
first time. 
  The Huangjuezhuang power plant will have a total installed 
capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts. In the first stage of 
construction, two 200MW coal-fired units will be installed; the 
project is a joint investment construction effort on the part of 
the State and Sichuan Province. Construction officially began in 
November 1991. The No. 1 unit was among the units that would 
give the nation an increase of 12,000MW in 1993. The No. 1 unit 
will help to ease Sichuan's energy shortage and promote the 
province's economic growth. 
  The plant's No. 2 unit could be finished and could begin 
generating power by June 1994.

  [Text] On 7 December, tens of thousands of mine 
construction workers and local people gathered in Honggu 
District of Lanzhou Municipality to attend the ceremony for the 
startup of construction of the Haishiwan mineshaft by the Yaojie 
Mining Bureau. At 2:30 p.m., Zhong Zhaolong, Standing Committee 
member of the Gansu Provincial Committee, Vice Governor Cui 
Zhenghua and others ignited tumultuous applause at the formal 
announcement of commencement of the project. 
  Authorities of the Ministry of Coal, State Energy Investment 
Corporation, and provincial and municipal departments attended 
the ceremony. 
  The Haishiwan mineshaft, now approved by the State Council, 
is Gansu's largest mineshaft construction project. Its 
geological coal reserves are 243 million tons; it is designed 
for an annual output capability of 1.5 million tons, and it can 
remain in service for 81 years. The operating investment will be 
324 million yuan and it will be built in 78 months. It will be 
equipped with advanced technology and facilities and built to 
high-output and high-efficiency standards. The formal startup of 
construction is targeted to solve the mineshaft replacement 
predicament in the Yaojie mining district as quickly as 
possible, and it will help to ease the serious coal shortage 
situation that exists in the two provinces of Gansu and Qinghai. 
  Since the Haishiwan mineshaft project was listed as a 
national preparatory project in 1990, the national ministries 
and commissions involved, and the provincial and municipal 
departments concerned gave it their full support, and the 
ahead-of-schedule preparations handled by the Yaojie Mining 
Bureau proceeded smoothly. So far, over 93 million yuan have 
been raised, and the civil engineering work has been done on the 
48,000 square meter work site, getting it ready for construction 
to begin on the main shaft, ventilator shaft and adits, and 
bringing it to the highest standard of readiness for any capital 
construction project in Gansu's coal mining history.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Qin Jingwu [4440 0079 0582]] </F>
  [Text] China's coal industry made new gains in reform and 
development last year as its annual raw coal output reached 1.14 
billion tons, 25.50 million tons more than the previous year; 16 
new mines went into operation during the year, increasing the 
annual production capability by 11.16 million tons. Coal exports 
were 18.05 million tons. 
  Coal makes up over 75 percent of China's primary energy 
resources, and 82 percent of the electric power generated last 
year was produced from coal. Last year China freed up coal 
prices in the east and eliminated the 2 billion yuan subsidies, 
and when the key coal mines got into the market they 
concentrated on raising their economic performance, shipped and 
sold specific volumes, closed inefficient mines at 42 locations, 
and transferred 150,000 workers to diversified industries, while 
coal production for the year reached 470 million tons, which was 
12.50 million tons less than the previous year. The per capita 
raw coal production rate for key national coal enterprises was 
1.4 tons, reducing the annual losses to less than 4 billion 
yuan, a reduction of more than 30 percent in losses over the 
previous year. The collective output of local coal mines and 
village coal mines was greatly increased over the previous year. 
  Diversification of national coal mines increased 
phenomenally 
last year, many products from domestic enterprises moved into 
the socialist market. A line of Sino-foreign joint ventures, and 
cooperative enterprises were formed. Last year's output value 
reached 18 billion yuan, a 20 percent increase over the previous 
year. There are now over 20 kinds of business activities in 
electric power, chemical industry, building materials, 
machinery, commercial trade, agricultural, forestry, animal 
husbandry, and fishing, at nearly 20,000 factory locations, 
producing more than 4,000 kinds of products, and there are more 
than 20 diversified mining operations with output values in 
excess of 100 million yuan. 
  According to Minister Wang Senhao of the Ministry of Coal, 
all coal prices will be freed up this year, and it is estimated 
that raw coal output will reach 1.16 billion tons, and mine 
shafts will be under construction at seven locations, which will 
increase the annual production capability by 11.55 million tons; 
new mine shafts will go into operation at 18 locations, 
increasing production capability by 31.99 million tons, and the 
output value of diversified operations will increase 15 percent. 
More local coal enterprises will be converted to coal-processing 
to develop more comprehensive operations. Mining districts with 
suitable circumstances will implement a more unified scale of 
construction and management combining coal, electricity, roads, 
and harbor operations, and at the same time electric power, 
metallurgy, chemical industry, and railroad enterprises will be 
encouraged to invest in coal operations. Areas lacking coal will 
be urged to go to rich coal districts to invest in coal mining 
operations and to engage in Sino-foreign commercial joint 
ventures and cooperative forms of coal operations.

  [Text] The coal industry is seeking foreign investment, 
technology, and know-how as it maps out new development plans 
for the next seven years. 
  The plea for overseas help came as Coal Industry Minister 
Wang Senhao outlined the major new plans in Beijing yesterday. 
  The plans include an 800-kilometre pipeline for liquefied 
coal [slurry], which will be built with funds and technology 
from the United States, Wang said. 
  A feasibility study for the pipeline--linking Mengxian in 
the 
coal-rich province of Shanxi to Weifang in Shandong Province--is 
being done jointly by Chinese and Americans. 
  The project is expected to help reduce pollution and improve 
coal combustion efficiency, Wang said. 
  To date, the industry has spent more than $4 billion from 
countries such as Japan, the United States, France and Sweden. 
  And Wang said more Sino-foreign coal-mining joint ventures 
will be established. 
  The industry dug 1.14 billion tons of coal in 1993, 25.5 
million tons more than in the previous year. 
  Production this year is expected to be 1.16 billion tons, 
but 
Wang predicted the national economy in the year 2000 will need 
1.4 billion tons a year. 
  So the industry will build more efficient mines in the next 
seven years, he said. 
  In 1993, 14.3 billion yuan ($1.64 billion) was used to dig 
16 
mines, capable of producing 11.2 million tons of coal. 
  This year, 18 mines able to produce 32 million tons a year 
will go into operation. 
  Wang said the coal industry will welcome investments from 
other sectors like railways, power generators, metallurgy and 
chemicals. 
  Chinese coal mines, which used to fulfill limited State 
quotas, will now be allowed to launch power plants and build 
railways, the minister said. 
  More than 75 percent of China's energy comes from coal and 
hundreds of millions of tons are carried across the provinces 
by train, adding to the rail bottleneck.

  [Text] China's coal industry is growing at the fastest rate 
in the 14 years of the nation's economic reform, according to an 
article in the January 3 issue of PEOPLE's daily by Wang Senhao, 
Minister of the Coal Industry. 
  In his article, Wang offered his ideas on how to remodel the 
industry for the market economy. 
  The output of raw coal increased from 618 million tons in 
1978 to 1.11 billion tons in 1992, an average annual rise of 
about 35.5 million tons. The hefty increase has ensured a 
relatively good supply of coal for the nation. 
  Advanced coal-mining technologies have also been introduced. 
The mechanization of mining rose from 33 percent in 1978 to 72 
percent in 1992. 
  The coal industry, a pillar of the economy, was hamstrung 
under the central planning system, Wang said. Laden with the 
problems created by a planned economy, the industry is finding 
it difficult to gear itself up for a free market. 
  An excess of workers in State coal mines has resulted in 
inefficiency and deficits. The major mines, which together 
produce 480 million tons, employ 3.6 million people, far above 
the world average staffing level. 
  Furthermore, the railroads cannot meet the demands of rising 
coal production. 
  Wang recommends a comprehensive development strategy for the 
industry that would invite investment from abroad and other 
sectors of the country's economy. 
  The central government has set a target of producing 1.5 
billion tons of coal by the year 2000. 
  That means China must raise production by about 400 million 
tons in the next six years. 
  "It will be a very tough task to achieve the goal," Wang 
said. 
  Wang called for investment through various channels such as 
the power, chemical, railway and metallurgical industries. 
Meanwhile, the central government should continue increasing its 
investment in developing major coal mines. Collectively-owned 
mines in townships should also be encouraged, Wang said. 
  China should also try to attract foreign investors to help 
develop coal mines in China. 
  Wang suggested that coal producers be encouraged to set up 
their own processing firms or power stations to alleviate the 
pressure on railroads. This could help coal producing firms 
integrate themselves into the market economy. 
  Unbalanced distribution combined with central planning 
helped 
turn coal-rich Northwest China into a major producer and 
exporter. The number of employees continued to increase even as 
mines were exhausted, and the result was inefficiency. 
  The coal industry must be updated. Employees of mining 
enterprises must be put to better use and surplus workers 
allowed to enter the service industry, Wang said. Sideline 
businesses may help lift coal mines out of their quandary. 
  A responsibility system or a shareholding system should be 
introduced in some profitable coal enterprises. This may help 
extricate them from the rigid control of government, Wang said. 
Those producers not included should also try to improve their 
management. 
  Wang held that China should increase its exports of coal. 
The 
nation exported 20 million tons of coal in 1992, only 1.8 
percent of its output. He attributed the meagre exports to the 
monopoly of the China National Coal Import and Export 
Corporation. 
  As a remedy, Wang said coal producers, especially the major 
ones, should gradually be allowed to export their products 
directly. Wang recommended establishing a China Chamber of 
Commerce of Coal Import and Export to take charge of export 
policy-making and other tasks such as setting the minimum prices 
and price fluctuation ranges. 
  In addition, the chamber of commerce could collect data from 
the international market and study the management of domestic 
producers to help improve efficiency.

  [Text] Chengdao is a little known area near the area where 
the Huang He enters the sea. However, it has caught world 
attention with the discovery of China's largest shallow sea oil 
field--the Chengdao oil field, which has recently been put into 
development. The development of this oil field not only presents 
a bright future for China's eastern oil industry, it also opens 
a new era in the development of China's shallow sea oil fields. 
  About 100 kilometers north of the famous oil city of 
Dongying 
in eastern China and out into the sea where the Huang He enters 
the sea, one sees four offshore oil rigs. According to the 
Shengli Shallow Sea Company, this oil field has a daily output 
of 1,500 tons. It has produced, up until late August this year, 
42,000 tons of crude oil. This is very encouraging news as the 
oil field has just been put into production. 
  The change from long-term exploration alone to exploration 
and development at the same time in the Chengdao oil field was 
necessitated by the development of the Shengli oil field and 
also the development of Eastern China's oil industry. The 
Shengli oil field is China's second largest oil field, with an 
output last year of 33.50 million tons, about one-fourth of the 
nation's total oil output. The Chinese government, in its Eighth 
Five-Year Plan, states the strategy of "stabilizing the east and 
developing the west" in oil development. However, it is no easy 
task to stabilize and maintain the current level of output in 
the east. The development of the Chengdao oil field has 
significance as a backup oil field to Shengli and also as a 
reserve area. This is an integral part of China's oil industry 
development strategy. 
  The Tarim Basin and Bo Hai Wan are China's two brightest 
stars in the oil industry. Bo Hai Wan, adjacent to Shengli, is a 
shallow sea area with an average depth of less than 20 meters. 
The layer of sedimentary rocks lies flat on top of each other on 
the sea bed. Bo Hai Wan has rich oil reserves. It is also a 
strategically important area in China's oceanic development. 
China views the continental shelf oil development and Tarim 
Basin oil development in the west as the keystone in its oil 
industry. 
  Bo Hai Wan is about 80,000 square kilometers in area and it 
is an integral part of the North China oil and gas area. The 
Chinese government started specific gravity measurement and 
exploration in Bo Hai Wan as early as 1965 and this work has 
never stopped. For the Shengli oil field, ever since the latter 
half of the 1980's, exploration has focused on the Bin Hai area, 
with the discovery of Gudong and other oil fields. In 1988, in 
the Bo Hai Wan area where the Huang He enters the sea, the 
Chengdao oil field was discovered. This field controls an 
oil-bearing area of 36 square kilometers. It was discovered and 
verified that the oil field has oil and gas reserves exceeding 
100 million tons, and by the year 1995 its capacity could be 
developed to an annual total of 1 million tons of oil. The 
annual increase of oil geological reserve is about 30 percent of 
Shengli's annual increase of reserve. Its long-term reserve is 
expected to reach several hundreds of million tons. The 
discovery was ranked as one of China's top 10 technological 
achievements in 1988 and is highly regarded by China's oil and 
technological circles. Shouldering the task of exploring and 
developing China's largest shallow sea oil field at present is 
the Shengli Oil Field Shallow Sea Exploration and Development 
Company. This is the only company in China capable of shallow 
sea and ultra-shallow sea oil exploration and development. The 
company not only undertakes the exploration and development of 
Chengdao oil field, it also dispatches oil rigs and ships to 
Liaodong Wan and North Bay to work in the shallow waters there. 
The company is a significant force in the exploration and 
development of continental shelf and shallow sea oil development 
in the eastern part of China. 
  The company has about 2,600 employees, three docks, five 
offshore oil rigs, a floating platform and 34 auxiliary vessels 
including two triple-purpose vessels equipped with 
satellite-guided navigational aids. The special-purpose wharf 
was completed and put into operation at the end of July. The 
dock can accommodate all ship and platforms. 
  With the decision in 1984 by the Chinese government to set 
up 
the Shengli Oil field Shallow Sea Oil Drilling Company, Shengli 
Oil Field Shallow Sea Development Company also underwent 
corresponding changes to keep up with the development. Its scale 
of operation expanded continuously. The technology of oceanic 
oil development went to new highs. This is particularly so since 
last year when good news came in oil drilling. Eight oil wells 
each with a daily output of 100 tons were drilled one after the 
other, greatly increasing the oil-bearing area of Chengdao oil 
field and also the geological reserves of the oil field. 
  Wei Xueyi, deputy general manager of Shengli oil field, is 
also general manager of the Shallow Sea Company and the person 
responsible for the development of the Chengdao oil field. He 
remarked that the change from exploration alone to exploration 
and development together is an historical change. Chengdao will 
be responsible for 30 percent of the increase in production in 
the Shengli oil field and this is very significant in the 
nation's oil development strategy of stabilizing and maintaining 
the east. However, he said, because of various limitations such 
as capital, the pace of development cannot be pushed too fast. 
The task this year for Chengdao oil field is to have eight 
exploration wells and three production wells and to have an 
additional geological reserve of 20-30 million tons. The company 
takes "the easy one first, the high output ones first, early 
development and early harvest" approach. The company is taking a 
pragmatic approach of building smaller and easier drilling 
platforms and trying to put into production as soon as possible 
the wells that have been drilled. 
  In order to expedite the development of shallow sea oil, 
Shengli Shallow Sea Oil Exploration and Development Company 
relentlessly explored new technology and has successfully raised 
the technological level of oceanic oil exploration. Over 100 
technological achievements were made. One of the technological 
achievements is the self-designed and built "Shengli No. 2" 
shallow sea "Walking" oil rig, which can walk in ultra-shallow 
waters at a speed of 60 meters per hour--the world's first 
ultra-shallow sea walking oil rig--and is ranked as one of the 
top 10 technological achievements for 1992. 
  In order to develop the rich reserves of this shallow water 
oil field, Wei Xueyi and his management team are traveling 
throughout the nation and also overseas for the purchase of 
offshore oil drilling platforms, oil rigs and various transport 
vessels and equipment so as to expedite the development of this 
oil field. This is also the golden opportunity for foreign 
companies to sell equipment and technology to China. 
  Obviously, the development of Chengdao oil field opens up a 
new road for the development of Bo Hai Wan and China's Shallow 
Sea oil development. A new horizon and new hopes are now 
visible. A lot of human resources and material and capital will 
be put into the Bo Hai Wan and the continental shelf development 
between now and the advent of the next century.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 Sep, New China News Agency--(Reported by 
reporter Liu Puquan)--Mr. Zhang Bofa, deputy mayor of Beijing, 
disclosed today that China Petroleum and Natural Gas Company and 
Beijing Metropolitan City will jointly build the 
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-to-Beijing Pipeline, now that the project 
has been approved by the State Planning Commission. The pipeline 
will supply natural gas to Beijing by the year 1997. This is an 
important step China has taken to support Beijing's effort to 
win the right to host the International Olympic Games in the 
year 2000. 
  The pipeline from Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia natural gas fields 
to 
Beijing will measure 800 kilometers in length and more than 600 
centimeters in diameter. The pipeline runs through Shaanxi, 
Shanxi, and Hobei provinces and passes through five river 
crossings across the Huang He and 140 river crossings across 
numerous smaller rivers. It crosses railroads in 20 places, 
highways in 48 places and runs through complicated relief and 
geological structures such as hilly areas, valleys, and gorges 
and the loess plateau. The project will take three years to 
complete. Work on the project is planned to commence during the 
first half of 1994 and by the end of 1997 the conditions will be 
there for the supply of natural gas to Beijing. Total 
engineering investment is about 2.5 billion yuan. When Phase I 
of the project is completed, the pipeline will be able to supply 
about 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Beijing per year. 
  At the same time, Beijing will also start work on its 
natural 
gas supply, storage and usage facilities to synchronize with the 
pipeline project. Total investment is about 1.5 billion yuan. 
  When Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia natural gas is made available to 
Beijing by the pipeline, the natural gas will replace the 
charcoal. It will reduce the number of residential fireplaces by 
600,000 and the number of furnaces in public utilities and 
industrial users by 40,000. This will improve greatly the 
environmental conditions of Beijing and raise it to the level 
and standards required by the World Health Organization.

  [Text] Tarim oil field has received a loan of US$500 
million from the Xinjiang Branch Bank of the Bank of China, 
opening the way for further exploration and development of the 
oil field. 
  The Deputy Director, Xie Zhiqiang, of the Tarim Petroleum 
Prospecting and Development Directorate, announced that during 
four years of prospecting in northern and central Tarim, 
covering an area of over 30,000 square kilometers, over 95,000 
kilometers of two-dimensional digital seismic prospecting, and 
2,200 kilometers of three-dimensional prospecting have been 
completed, 169 exploratory wells have been drilled, totalling 
970,000 meters of drilling footage, and industrial-grade oil and 
gas flows have been found at 81 wells. Six oil fields that have 
been confirmed or basically confirmed and ready for exploitation 
are the Lunnan, Sangtamu, Donghetang, Jilake, Jiefang Qudong, 
and Tazhong-4 oil fields. Three hundred million tons of oil 
reserves and about 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas 
reserves are basically confirmed and under control. What is 
especially satisfying is that the Tazhong-4 oil field, which has 
130 million tons of reserves, has the resources to assure the 
construction of a 5-million ton crude oil production capability. 
This year, the Tazhong-10 and Tazhong-6 wells have each produced 
high-output flows of oil and gas, demonstrating that central 
Tarim is an area of large-sized oil fields. 
  Important gains have also been made in development and 
construction. Construction of crude oil production capabilities 
of 1.4 million tons was begun at Lunnan, Sangtamu, and Jiefang 
Qudong oil fields last year. The production capacity of 
Donghetang oil field was expanded from 750,000 tons to 2.15 
million tons last year. One hundred and sixty five kilometers of 
the 230-kilometer Taklimakan desert highway have been completed, 
and it is expected to be open to the Tazhong-4 oil field by the 
end of June next year; 140 kilometers of the oil-field pipeline 
have also been completed this year. 
  Petroleum exploration will be further accelerated during the 
next three years. It is estimated that by 1995 confirmed and 
controlled petroleum geology reserves will be 800 million tons, 
and in 1996 the annual output of crude oil will be 5 million 
tons. 
  The US$500 million loaned by the Xinjiang Branch of the Bank 
of China for petroleum exploration and development in Tarim will 
be used over the next two years to buy facilities, precision 
instruments, and desert transportation vehicles needed for the 
oil field.

  [Text] The "1,000-ton prototype industrial production of 
coal-based synthetic gasoline" key national S&amp;T project 
undertaken by the No. 2 Chemical Fertilizer Plant in Pucheng, 
Shanxi, is now producing oil. 
  Testing of this project still has 1,500 hours to go and the 
completion of these tests will have importance for making 
practical use of national energy resources by industrializing 
the coal liquification process. 
  In the early 1980s, the CAS Shanxi Coal Chemistry Research 
Institute began to study two new industrial processes for 
coal-based synthetic gasoline, and an intermediate test was 
conducted at the Daixian Fertilizer Plant in Shanxi with good 
results. In 1990, the State Planning Commission gave the 
go-ahead for an industrialization test for coal-based synthetic 
gasoline. The test was undertaken jointly by the Pucheng No. 2 
Chemical Fertilizer Plant and the CAS Shanxi Coal Chemistry 
Institute. The test project was designed for an annual 
production of 2,000 tons of oil and 7.5 million cubic meters of 
coal gas. Altogether the central government, Shanxi Province, 
and Pucheng Municipality invested over 22.33 million yuan. 
  On 16 December, after nearly three years of effort, the 
researchers and technicians successfully completed the 
chemical-starter test-vehicle mission, and when they reached the 
oil production stage, they immediately launched into the 
1,500-hour test and assessment stage. 
  Shanxi Province will build a pilot plant with a 50,000- to 
100,000-ton output capability based on the outcome of this 
industrial test.

  [Text] On 20 December at the Diaoyutai Hotel in Beijing, 
the China National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation signed 
a contract with the U.S. corporation, Sumitomo (Shangshi Zhushi 
Huishe), and Japan-Indonesia Petroleum for cooperative 
development of petroleum in area three of southeastern Tarim 
Basin. This is the first contract for foreign cooperation in 
petroleum exploration and development in the Tarim Basin, and 
the first contract reached through open bidding for petroleum 
cooperation on the China mainland. 
  Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum and 
Natural Gas Corporation, said the signing of the Tarim petroleum 
contract by China, the U.S. and Japan not only represents the 
new era for the input of foreign funds and technology into the 
exploration and development of petroleum in Tarim, but it also 
signals the arrival of a new era for the Chinese petroleum 
industry and of fully opening up to the outside world. 
  State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, and Tomur Dawamat, 
Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing 
Committee, attended the signing ceremony. Before the ceremony, 
Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and Vice Chairman Tomur Dawamat met with 
the three representatives who signed the contract. 
  The area of the southwestern Tarim Basin scheduled for 
foreign cooperative development is located within the boundary 
of Qiemo County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and 
covers an area of 14,475.4 square kilometers. This February, 
with the approval of the State Council, the southwestern part of 
the Tarim Basin was designated a new area for expanding foreign 
cooperation in petroleum development on the China mainland. 
Public bidding began on 1 March, and 68 corporations from 17 
countries responded with bids, some of whom made on-site 
inspections of the subject area. By the end of October, the 
various bidding organizations had delivered their bids and 
planning documents to the China National Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Corporation. After careful consideration the U.S. 
corporation was the first organization invited for contract 
negotiations, and an agreement was reached after numerous 
discussions. 
  It is understood that the form of the contract signed on 20 
December is consistent with the terms used in all Chinese 
offshore and mainland cooperative endeavors. During the 
eight-year prospecting period, the foreign parties will bear all 
prospecting expenses and risks, and when oil and gas fields are 
found, both parties will jointly fund development and 
production, and will divide the crude oil produced in accordance 
with the stipulations of the contract. China will observe the 
international market price structure, and use U.S. dollars to 
buy the oil apportioned to the foreign participants that is 
taken from the Tarim area. This will dispel any misgivings the 
foreign interests may have about shipping crude oil out of that 
area.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Xie Ranhao [6200 3544 3185]] </F>
  [Text] At a meeting recently held in Beijing, the President 
of the China National Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation, 
Wang Tao, proclaimed that the string of natural gas discoveries 
that have been made since the end of the "Seventh 5-Year Plan" 
prove that China has reached a new stage in growth of reserves. 
  In the last three years, under the policy of giving equal 
importance to oil and gas, the level of effort in gas-geology 
research and exploration has been raised, and the growth of 
reserve volumes has equaled that of the previous 40 years. 
Because of a series of findings, China is now taking the initial 
steps to create three new large gas regions. 
  One is the largest contiguous gas field ever found on the 
China mainland, which is located in northern Shaanxi and covers 
an area of over 2,340 square kilometers, where most recently, at 
Ih Ju Meng in Inner Mongolia a number of industrial-grade wells 
were drilled that foretell even greater expansion of the 
gas-bearing area. 
  Two is a group of gas fields found in eastern Sichuan, and 
high-output gas wells found in central and southern Sichuan that 
forecast the existence of more major gas fields. 
  Three is the finding of geological indicators for natural 
gas 
reserves of considerable volume in the Turpan-Hami, Junggar, and 
Tarim basins, including some in Tarim that are hoped will 
continue to expand in scale. 
  Additionally, in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, a gas-bearing 
region rich in natural gas has been confirmed. 
  Wang Tao said that it is expected that confirmed volumes of 
natural gas will more than double over the next seven years. He 
firmly believes that based on finds already confirmed and the 
expected growth of reserves over the next several years that the 
ground has been laid for a rapid development of China's natural 
gas bases.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Chaowen [1728 6389 2429]: "Annual </F>
Petroleum Output of 143.8 Million Tons Sets Record"] 
  [Text] NCNA, Beijing, 30 Dec -- Both China's continental 
and offshore petroleum industries reached new plateaus, and 
national oil output set a new record of 143.8 million tons. 
  By 27 December, the China Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Corporation had fully met its state plan for the output of oil 
and natural gas, and the total annual output of crude oil was 
139.2 million tons, 1.037 million tons above last year's figure, 
and the natural gas output was 15.4 billion cubic meters, up 290 
million cubic meters from last year. The China Offshore 
Petroleum Corporation produced 4.60 million tons of crude oil, 
up 0.73 million tons from last year. This outstanding 
accomplishment enabled China to maintain its rising position 
among the world's main petroleum producers. 
  Beginning this year, the continental oil fields brought 
about 
a favorable situation in which east and west are keeping pace 
with each other. The eastern region, as represented by the 
Daqing oil field, vigorously implemented the "stable oil output 
and control of water consumption" system engineering project and 
posted an annual output of 55.90 million tons of crude oil, up 
0.244 million tons from last year. In the west, all oil fields 
strove to create favorable conditions, increasing their crude 
oil output by 1.739 million tons compared with last year. 
Offshore oil and gas exploration and production also set records.

  [Text] Erlian oil field, recipient of a "Seventh 5)Year 
Plan" national quality engineering project award, went into 
operation in late 1989, one year ahead of schedule, and by the 
end of 1993 its cumulative oil output was 4.36 million tons, 
which earned tax benefits of 601 million yuan, and moreover, it 
has produced a steady supply of 1 million tons of crude oil for 
three years making it another star performer in the Chinese 
petroleum industry. Erlian oil field is located on the Xilin 
Gol prairie at the northern border of Inner Mongolia, a frigid 
and forbidding place where production and living conditions are 
most difficult. Over 3,000 workers braved these obstacles, and 
overcame the severe natural environment and the many production 
and technical challenges, and achieved a stable annual output 
from a geologically complex oil field. Last year, these oil 
field workers and staff conducted explorations over a wide area 
at Saihan Toroi, Eren Nur, Jargalang, and Uliastai, further 
expanded the range of oil finds, produced 1.01 million tons of 
crude oil, completing their nationally assigned production 
mission over quota. By the end of 1993, 4 combined 
oil)production stations, 4 transfer stations, and 58 jipei 
[computerized distribution?] stations and departments were 
operating with 820 water)oil wells, while overall production and 
livelihood installations were being improved daily, a 361 
kilometer oil pipeline steadily pumped crude oil to Saihan 
Toloi, Inner Mongolia.

  [Text] China's largest oil field, Daqing oil field, 
produced 55.9019 million tons of crude oil last year, an over 
production of 501,900 tons, setting its highest level of 
production in history. The oil field went into operation in 
1960, and its output of crude oil has risen every year since. In 
1976, annual crude oil output broke the 50-million-ton mark, and 
it has now been operating steadily for 18 years, having produced 
a cumulative total of over 1.22 billion tons of oil for China, 
setting a new world record of longevity for oil fields of its 
type throughout the world. 
  Experts claim that Daqing is the world's largest terrigenous 
oil deposit, and has geological features very different from the 
world's major marine deposits which make it a difficult oil 
field to develop. Daqing oil field had, therefore, to make 
creative advancements in applying the water flood recovery 
method widely used around the world. Daqing employed a range of 
advanced technological measures to deal with its low-, medium-, 
and high-water stages and was able to effectively sustain a high 
and stable level of productivity. 
  It is estimated that an annual crude output of 55 million 
tons can be maintained up to 1995, and a 50-million ton output 
level can be maintained until the year 2000.

  [Text] Sichuan Province, China's largest natural gas 
production base, produced 6.796 billion cubic meters of natural 
gas in 1993, an increase of 4.5 percent over the previous year, 
setting the highest record in history. 
  Sichuan produces over 40 percent of all the natural gas 
produced in the country. The Sichuan Petroleum Administrative 
Bureau collected scarce funds to speed up the exploration of the 
Datianchi, Wubaiti, and other new gas fields of the Chuandong 
Drilling and Prospecting Corporation. Many natural gas reserves 
were found, and not only did last year's natural gas output at 
the Chuandong gas field reach 3.9 billion cubic meters, it made 
Sichuan the leading contributor to the nation's natural gas 
reserves.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jan -- President of the China National 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation, Wang Tao, has announced 
that foreign cooperation in onshore oil will be expanded and the 
second round of bidding is about to begin. 
  There will be two kinds of bidding in the second round. One 
will be for prospecting ventures at 26 locations covering a 
total of 216,000 square kilometers where there are estimated 
reserves of 6.2 billion tons of oil and 800 billion cubic meters 
of natural gas distributed in parts of the provinces, regions 
and cities of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan, 
Shandong, Hubei, Gansu, Qinghai and Tianjin. The other will be 
to raise the extraction rates from old oil fields, including 11 
developed areas with a total oil-bearing area of 190.2 square 
kilometers with geological reserves of 380 billion tons at 8 
locations: Shengli, Dagang, Huabei, Jianghan, Henan, Jiangsu, 
Zhongyuan and Jilin. 
  This year, in oil and gas poor areas there will be 
construction for comprehensive use and for long-distance oil and 
gas pipelines, using many forms of expanded cooperation with 
foreign commercial interests, and a search will be made for 
foreign partnerships and international management for 
exploration and development of oil and gas resources. 
  Wang Tao extended a warm welcome to petroleum, construction, 
and financial interests around the world to cooperate with China 
in developing onshore petroleum, and he also welcomed domestic 
industrial, local, business, and Taiwan friends and overseas 
Chinese to make investments, and buy shares in prospecting and 
developing oil.

  [Text] Last year, China's offshore crude oil production was 
4.63 million tons, an increase of 760,000 tons over the previous 
year, earning a total of US$600 million, a 20 percent increase 
over the previous year. According to data from the China 
National Offshore Oil Corporation, impressive gains have been 
made in offshore oil and gas prospecting as 40,000 kilometers of 
linear seismic survey were completed in the year, 17 exploratory 
wells were drilled, 16 new prospecting structures were found, 
and 7 oil and gas discoveries were made for a success rate of 44 
percent, including 11 new structures independently discovered, 
yielding 6 oil and gas finds for a success rate of 54.5 percent. 
Between August and October last year, 3 offshore oil fields went 
into production, and that raised the daily offshore oil output 
level up to 17,000 tons. 
  Calls for petroleum bids for nearby offshore areas in the 
East China Sea were very successful as China joined 15 
corporations from 7 countries in forming 9 groups and signing 18 
petroleum contracts and agreements. Bids were concluded for an 
area of 64,246 square kilometers at 18 locations, covering 90 
percent of the total area for which bids were sought. The 
foreign corporations working at their own risk, drilled over 50 
exploratory wells in the contracted areas, at investments of 
over US$300 million. The successful bidders were such major oil 
corporations as Texaco, Chevron, Esso, (AGIP), Shell, and Japan 
Oil. The main reason for the successful bidding for East China 
Sea oil is said to be the progress of reforms in China, the 
stable and rapid economic development, and the cooperative image 
and reputation of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, 
as well as the attractiveness of East China Sea oil resources 
for foreign corporations.

  [Text] On 15 December, a ceremony was held in Beijing for 
the signing of an agreement between the Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region Branch Bank of the Bank of China and the Tarim 
Petroleum Prospecting and Development Directorate for a loan of 
US$500 million. 
  This is the second major loan to be concluded following the 
loan of US$700 million granted on 17 December 1991. The purpose 
of the loan is mainly to provide foreign exchange needed for the 
purchase of special facilities, precision instruments, desert 
transport vehicles, and other materials needed in 1994 and 1995 
to speed up prospecting and development at the Tarim oil field. 
  Xie Zhiqiang, Deputy Director of the Tarim Petroleum 
Prospecting and Development Directorate, attending the ceremony 
in Beijing, explained that impressive gains have been made in 
petroleum prospecting and development activity at Tarim, and its 
cumulative production of crude oil is 3.22 million tons, and 
furthermore, it is estimated that the goal of reaching an output 
capability of 5 million tons will be fully attainable by 1995. 
There are a number of important technical and economic 
indicators that have reached national and international levels. 
The oil field has already begun to repay part of its foreign 
exchange loan from the Bank of China three years ahead of 
schedule.

  [Text] United States oil firm Atlantic Richfield Company 
(Arco) plans to move into the development of onshore fields. 
  And Arco's Yacheng 13-1 operation, the largest offshore 
gasfield in China, is scheduled to go onstream in January 1996, 
the company announced. 
  Arco experts have spent the last few months surveying 
Chinese 
onshore oil and gas fields in Daqing, Liaohe, Dagang, Sichuan 
and Shengli. 
  "We are looking at many opportunities for onshore oil 
operations," said John Knepler, vice-president of the 
Shekon-based Arco China Incorporate. 
  "But we have to decide which ones we believe are economic to 
pursue," he said. 
  The Yacheng field will supply natural gas through pipelines 
to Hong Kong and Hainan Island. The gas will feed electric power 
plants and a fertilizer factory. 
  "By the year 2002 the Yacheng Gasfield will be producing 9.3 
million cubic metres each day, and we will have recovered our 
investment," the 48-year-old vice-president said. 
  The gasfield, with reserves of 100 billion cubic metres, was 
discovered by Arco, with the China National Offshore Oil 
Corporation and the Santa Fe Energy Corporation in 1983. 
  At present, Arco is focusing its efforts on getting partners 
for oil and gas exploration and development in China. 
  The average worldwide exploration success rate for 1987 to 
1992 was only 6 percent. 
  "We know that exploration work is very risky and that is why 
the successes must pay for the failures or we would go out of 
business," said Knepler. 
  Arco is bullish on the prospects of finding large quantities 
of oil and gas both onshore and offshore, he said. 
  Arco, which came to China in 1979, is regarded as one of the 
lucky foreign oil firms which have so far operated successfully 
in China. 
  Arco is the eighth largest non-governmental oil operator in 
the world.

Design Institute: "Technical Features of First Run-Up Test of 
Turbine-Generator Unit at the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  On 29 March 1991, the first run-up test of the Qinshan 
nuclear power plant's turbine-generator unit succeeded with 
non-nuclear steam and reached the rated speed of 3,000 
revolutions per minute. The steam was generated from the heat 
converted from the mechanical rotation energy of the main pump 
in the primary loop. The features of this successful run-up test 
are: 1) the cost of a de-bugging boiler is avoided; and 2) the 
coordination test of the primary and secondary loops is 
conducted. This paper presents a concise report on the technical 
preparation, testing process, and results of the 
turbine-generator unit run-up with non-nuclear steam. 
<H3>  1. Power Installation and De-Bugging at Qinshan Nuclear 
Power Plant </H3>
<H5>  1.1 Outline of Power Installation </H5>
  The power installation at Qinshan nuclear power plant 
consists of the following three groups: the pressurized-water 
reactor, the primary loop system, and the secondary loop system. 
The parameters of the reactor and the reactor coolant system 
are: working pressure, 15.2 MPa; average temperature, 302C; 
rated flow, 24,000 tons per hour (t/h); rated reactor thermal 
power, 966 MW; and is projected to reach 1035 MW. For the 
secondary loop system the parameters are: rated steam flow, 1870 
to 2020 t/h; pressure, 5.2 to 5.54 MPa. The steam is capable of 
generating electricity of 310 to 330 MW. 
  The reactor coolant system is composed of two loop circuits 
connected in parallel. Each loop circuit has one steam generator 
and one main coolant pump. All the components in each circuit 
are connected to the reactor with 316 stainless steel tubes 
forming a sealed circuit. In addition, the system contains one 
pressure regulator and one pressure relief box as well as 
instruments and valves for operation control and safety 
protection. 
  In addition to the main system, the primary loop has 16 
auxiliary systems whose functions are divided into three 
categories as follows: 
  (1) The starting and shut-off system for the operation of 
the 
reactor and the primary loop, including: chemical volume control 
system, boron recovery system, main pump water sealing system, 
water draining system, equipment cooling water system, reactor 
shut-off cooling system, and sample collection system. 
  (2) The safety and emergency system, including the safety 
injection system, the safety shell sprinkling system, and the 
de-hydrogen system. 
  (3) Environmental protection system, such as waste gas and 
liquid waste processing system, as well as liquid waste 
solidification and solid waste processing system. 
  The main installation in the secondary loop is the 
turbine-generator unit. At the Qinshan nuclear power plant, the 
saturated steam turbine is of the condensing steam type having 
single shaft, three cylinders, and four exhausts. The generator 
with inner water-cooled stator and rotor is brushless, magnetic 
exciting, three-phase alternating current generator. Its 
terminal voltage is 18 kV, with a rotating speed of 3,000 
revolutions per minute (RPM). Between the high-pressure cylinder 
and low-pressure cylinder of the turbine, two steam-water 
separation heaters are installed to eliminate moisture and to 
heat up the steam. During turbine load shedding, 70 percent of 
the steam can quickly enter the condenser through the bypass 
after its temperature and pressure are reduced to prevent shock 
to the reactor due to excessive load change. If leakage in the 
main steam pipe occurs, the steam flow rate will be limited by 
the flow restrictor installed at the outlet of the steam 
generator so that the tendency of reactor overcooling due to the 
excess loss of steam is reduced. The condenser is cooled with 
sea water. The condensed water is de-salted 100 percent to 
assure water quality. 
<H5>  1.2 De-Bugging Process at Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant </H5>
  The pressure test of the coolant system is completed on 5 
November 1990, which indicates that the Qinshan nuclear power 
project has progressed to the overall de-bugging phase. 
  The Qinshan nuclear power plant de-bugging is conducted in 
A, 
B, and C stages. Stage A, the preliminary test, includes the 
cold state test (A[.sup]1[/]) and the hot state test 
(A[.sup]2[/]). The characteristics are as follows: more test 
items, longer cycles, and more crisscross complexities. Because 
the Stage A test is before the nuclear fuel loading, we hope 
that all possible problems will show up and be discovered at 
this early stage, so that adjustment of the system and equipment 
can be made under non-radiative conditions. At the same time, we 
hope that the equipment defects that take long cycles of 
corrective measures will also be exposed. Stage B consists of 
nuclear fuel, loading as well as the cold state and hot state 
tests after the loading (B[.sup]1[/]); the first reactor 
critical test (B[.sup]2[/]); and the low power test 
(B[.sup]3[/]). Between Stages A and B, there is a period of 
three to four months for installation, system adjustment, and 
repair, as well as for the safety shell's strength and sealing 
tests. Stage C is the rated power test of the generator, in 
which the power is gradually to its full rated output. Then the 
complete project is to be checked and accepted by the State. 
<H3>  2. Run-Up of Nuclear Power Turbine-Generator Unit and Its 
Timing Selection </H3>
<H5>  2.1 Nuclear Power Turbine-Generator Unit </H5>
  Based on the American Westinghouse building block model 
(BB051, BB074) with some modifications, the steam turbine of the 
Qinshan nuclear power plant's 300MW turbine-generator unit is of 
the condensing steam type with a single shaft, three cylinders, 
and four exhausts, designed and manufactured by the Shanghai 
Steam Turbine Factory. The generator, with a rated power of 
310MW, is manufactured by the Shanghai Electric Machinery 
Factory. 
<H5>  3.3 Timing Selection for First Run-Up of Turbine-Generator </H5>
  The turbine-generator unit is 40 meters (m) long and 7.5 m 
wide. Any major mechanical trouble during run-up would cause 
serious economic loss, therefore the timing of the 
turbine-generator run-up is crucial. 
  According to the aforementioned de-bugging stages, during 
Tests A[.sup]2[/] and B[.sub]1[/] the primary loops can 
generate non-nuclear steam for turbine run-up. However, during 
the run-up period the primary loop goes through a large 
temperature and pressure change, hence, in Test B[.sup]1[/] 
with the fuel already loaded, the abnormal temperature and 
pressure change will unfavorably affect the nuclear fuel 
components and other parts. Therefore, the first run-up of the 
turbine-generator unit should not be conducted during Test 
B[.sup]1[/]. 
  The turbine unit run-up test is also a large-scale combined 
de-bugging test of the primary and the secondary loops, 
therefore, it is appropriate to conduct the first run-up in the 
later phase of Test A[.sup]2[/]. Besides, there is a period 
of three to four months for equipment adjustments and 
corrections after the completion of Test A[.sup]2[/]. Hence, 
any run-up malfunction can be identified and corrected during 
that period. 
  To sum up, the first run-up of the turbine-generator unit is 
scheduled for the later phase of the hot-state test 
(A[.sup]2[/]) in the preliminary test stage. 
<H5>  3. Test Goals </H5>
  (1) To measure the vibration amplitudes and phases of all 
the 
bearings during unit speed increase, the critical rotating 
speed, and to verify the balance standard of the turbine 
generator's shaft system. 
  (2) To verify the bearing temperature, and the operation of 
the control set-up, as well as to investigate whether the 
various oil pressure indications meet the requirement. 
  (3) To inspect whether all the moving parts operate 
normally. 
<H5>  4. Selection of Steam Source for First Run-Up </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Selection of Steam Source </H5>
  Overseas experiences in nuclear power plant installations 
reveal that steam sources for the first run-up test of 
turbine-generator unit are as follows: 
  (1) Installation of a de-bugging boiler with sufficient 
steam 
capacity. 
  (2) Utilization of existing steam available at the old 
plant. 
  (3) Utilization of the rotating energy of the reactor 
coolant 
pump to heat up the main system; as well as using the heat 
capacities of the system and the equipment to generate 
non-nuclear steam from the steam generator to perform the run-up 
of turbine-generator unit. 
  The Qinshan nuclear power plant is located at Qinshan, 
Haiyan 
County, Zhejiang Province. Since the new location has no nearby 
power plant or steam supply, the steam source for the first 
run-up is a choice of either installing a de-bugging boiler or 
taking advantage of the main pump energy. 
<H5>  4.2 Selection of Steam Source for Qinshan Turbine Run-Up </H5>
<H5>  4.2.1 Comparison of Plans </H5>
  There have been successful experiences abroad in the 
turbine-generator unit run-up with non-nuclear steam produced 
from either de-bugging boilers or main pump energies, especially 
that there is no significant problem with de-bugging boilers 
present practically no serious problems. However, most of the 
nuclear power stations utilizing non-nuclear steam to run-up 
turbines are those having well-developed turbine-generator units. 
  The de-bugging boiler can fully provide flexibility during 
the de-bugging of the second loop and the turbine-generate unit; 
however, it will amplify the construction cost, time and land 
required. A standard medium-pressure boiler will produce steam 
at 110-130 t/h with steam pressure of 3.8 MPa. The boiler proper 
costs 3 million yuan. It will be over 4 million yuan with the 
additional investments of matching auxiliary components and 
boiler modifications. 
  Overseas experiences show that the steam energy required to 
start a mega-kilowatt class turbine-generator unit, and to run 
at the rated rotating speed is 2-3 percent of the rated steam 
consumption. As estimated by the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, 
the turbine-generator unit of the Qinshan nuclear power plant 
probably requires 5-7 percent rated steam consumption, i,e. 
100-140 t/h of steam with pressure greater than 1.96 MPa. 
  Although there is no extra investment and construction space 
involved, the utilization of non-nuclear steam from the rotating 
energy of the main pump in the reactor coolant system has 
certain degrees of difficulty and risk, identified mainly in the 
following areas: 
  (1) At present, none has the experience to run-up a 
turbine-generator unit with non-nuclear steam at the full-rated 
speed of 3,000 rpm. 
  (2) Since this is the first nuclear power turbine-generator 
unit in China, we lack accurate data on the function of the 
turbine-generator unit, the power demand for run-up, and other 
parameters. 
  (3) The reactor coolant system of the Qinshan nuclear power 
plant is composed of two loop circuits. Yet, the run-up 
experiences in foreign countries are in great part based on 
systems with four loop circuits. The two-circuit system and the 
four-circuit system are quite different in energy generation and 
storage. 
  To sum up, the difficulty lies in whether the Qinshan 
nuclear 
power plant's main system can generate and store enough energy 
to run-up the turbine-generator unit to the rated operating 
speed and to maintain a steady operation. 
<H5>  4.2.2 Energy Calculation of the Non-Nuclear Steam Source </H5>
  The main system of the primary loop utilizes the heat from 
two reactor coolant pumps and the electric heating elements of 
the pressurizer to raise the system temperature and pressure 
from room condition to 280C and 15.2 MPa as well as to 
maintain normal operation under these parameters. At this time, 
the steam pressure in the steam generator is 6.32 MPa. Due to 
the fact that the input energy of the main pump is far smaller 
than the energy required to run-up the turbine, after the 
turbine is started, the pressure of the steam generator 
gradually drops; subsequently, the temperature and the pressure 
of the main system drop accordingly. Therefore the final 
turbine-generator run-up state is determined by the operation 
safety limit of the main system. 
<H5>  4.2.2.1 Basis of Heat Engineering Calculation </H5>
  The highest liquid level of the steam generator is 11.4m; 
the 
lowest, 9.675m. 
  The initial steam pressure of the steam generator is 6.32 
MPa; the lowest, 2.94 MPa. 
  The lowest liquid level of the pressurizer is 2.5m. 
  The initial pressure of the pressurizer is 15.2 MPa; the 
lowest, 11.27 MPa. 
  The initial temperature of the system is 280C; the 
lowest, 235C. 
<H5>  4.2.2.2 Calculation of Main System Energy Output </H5>
  Heat released by the two main pumps running continuously 
(Q[.sup]p[/]): 


  Secondary side heat released from the steam generator 
(Q[.sup]g[/]) 
  Q[.sup]g[/] = q[.sub]i[/] - q[.sub]f[/] (kcal), 
  where, q[.sup]i[/]: heat capacity of the steam generator 
at the initial state; 
  q[.sup]f[/]: heat capacity of the steam 
generator at the final state. 
  Then, the total steam energy generating capacity from the 
main system (including the steam generator secondary side heat) 
during the run-up of the turbine-generator unit (Q[.sup]T[/]): 
  Q[.sup]T[/] = Q[.sub]p[/] x T + Q[.sub]m[/] + 
Q[.sup]s[/] + Q[.sub]g[/] + Q[.sub]e[/] - 
q[.sup]d[/] - q[.sub]c[/] 
  where, Q[.sup]e[/]: heat from the electric heating 
elements of pressurizer; 
  q[.sup]d[/]: heat dissipated from the main 
system; 
  q[.sup]c[/]: heat carried away by the chemical 
volume control system; 
  T: duration of the turbine run-up, hours (h). 
<H3>  4.2.2.3 Calculation of Steam Supplied By the Steam Generator 
During the Run-Up Period (G </H3>
[.sup]g[/]). 
  G[.sup]g[/] = G' + G" (t) 
  where, G': steam generated from the steam generator without 
feeding water; 
  G": steam generated from the steam generator during 
water feeding; and 


  Based on the above calculation, during the turbine run-up 
period, in 30 minutes the primary loop can supply the turbine 
unit 43.6t of saturated steam with 6.32-2.94 MPa. 
<H3>  4.2.3 Calculation of Liquid Level Change in the Pressurizer 
During Run-Up </H3>
  During run-up of the turbine-generator unit, the main system 
energy output causes reactor coolant temperature drop, which in 
turn causes coolant contraction. Although the deficit can be 
replenished with water in the pressurizer, yet the liquid level 
in the pressurizer must not drop so low as to expose the 
electric heating elements. To prevent this, during run-up the 
feeding water flow has to be increased to replenish water to the 
main system, and consequently heat consumption of the main 
system increases. 
  This calculation aims at determining the initial liquid 
level 
in the pressurizer before the run-up, and whether it is 
necessary to replenish water to the main system during the 
run-up. 
  Based on the heat engineering calculation, the temperature 
of 
the reactor coolant drops from 280C to 235C; and the 
pressure, from 15.2 MPa to 11.27 MPa. The changing of the 
coolant density causes the change of total water volume in the 
main system, namely, the liquid level in the pressurizer drops. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CEN-002C-39A>           Formula </FIG>



  According to the calculation, at the end of the 
turbine-generator run-up, the contraction of the main system 
coolant causes a drop of the pressurizer liquid level to 2.57m, 
which is more than marginally above the electric heating 
elements. 
<H5>  4.2.4 Assurance Measures </H5>
  During the turbine-generator run-up, the estimated required 
steam is 50 to 70 tons. Certain effective measures must be 
adopted to assure the successful run-up at the first trial. 
<H5>  4.2.4.1 Realigning Steam Pipeline Layout of Starting Steam </H5>

Extractor. 
  By normal starting procedure at a nuclear power plant, the 
working steam for the condenser steam extractor is the freshly 
generated steam from the steam generator. Each starting steam 
extractor requires 7000 kg/h working steam with 0.88 to 55.4 MPa 
pressure. Two starting steam extractors are installed at the 
Qinshan nuclear power plant. The system layout is shown in 
Figure 1. 



  The Qinshan nuclear power plant is equipped with two plant 
boilers to supply heat to the plant and steam to the auxiliary 
system of the primary loop whenever the reactor is not in 
operation. Each boiler supplies steam at the rate of 10t/h with 
1.27 MPa pressure. For the run-up, the steam pipeline is 
realigned in such a way that the boiler steam can flow directly 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CEN-002C-39B>           Figure 1. Steam System Flow Diagram of Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant </FIG>

to the starting air extractors. At the same time, the boiler 
steam is also used as heating steam for the de-oxygen device in 
the second loop. With this arrangement the non-nuclear steam 
from the primary loop can be solely used as turbine-generator 
run-up. 
<H3>  4.2.4.2 Raising the Temperature of Feeding Water to Steam 
Generator. </H3>
  The temperature of the de-oxygen water in the de-oxygen 
device and de-oxygen feeding water tank is raised to the highest 
possible degree with plant steam. Thus, the enthalpy in the 
water fed to the steam generator is increased, resulting in the 
slight increase of steam output. 
<H5>  4.2.4.3 Re-Analysis of Limits for Main System Operation </H5>
  Through the instantaneous analysis of the main system, 
calculation shows that the operation limits can be lowered. 
  In addition, the quality of the turbine-generator unit is 
warranted. We believe that the original estimation for run-up 
steam consumption, 5-7 percent of the rated steam consumption, 
is more than required. 
  The above analysis indicates that the non-nuclear steam 
run-up of the turbine-generator is feasible, therefore, the plan 
of using non-nuclear steam to run-up the turbine generator unit 
is decided to carry on. 
<H5>  5. Implementation of Turbine Run-Up </H5>
<H5>  5.1 Preliminary Test </H5>
  On 27 and 28 March 1991, five run-ups of the 
turbine-generator unit with non-nuclear steam were conducted, 
among which three run-ups were preliminary tests. The rotating 
speed of the first preliminary test started at 50 rpm and 
gradually increased to 600 rpm. Friction inspection of the unit 
was conducted after the operation became steady. The second test 
used the same rotating speed pattern. Overall inspection was 
conducted on the unit and system after steady operation. The 
speed of the third preliminary test started from 100 rpm, 
increased to 600 rpm, and was maintained at that speed for five 
minutes. Subsequently, the unit was operated at the starting 
speed of 150 rpm and then raised to 1200 rpm. The unit and 
system was completely inspected during the steady operation 
period (test results will be reported in another paper). After 
the three preliminary tests, the condition of the unit was 
satisfactory. With some other adjustments, the unit was on 
standby for the run-up. 
  Incorporating experiences learned from the preliminary 
tests, 
the following measures are to be taken to assure the successful 
first run-up of the turbine-generator unit to the rated speed of 
3000 rpm. 
  Take timely measures to operate the electromagnetic valve of 
the main steam isolation valve to reduce steam leak. 
  Carefully control the water-drainage before the main steam 
isolation valve to assure operation safety as well as to reduce 
direct steam consumption. 
  In the gathering and recording of test data, unify the 
command with increased proficiency and the use of microprocessor 
to minimize interruption while the run-up test is in progress. 
  Adjust the main system operation limits within the design 
tolerance during the run-up test. 
<H5>  5.2 Run-Up Test </H5>
  On 29 March 1991 
  1900 [Time]: With a long period of preparation, and 
adjustments after the three preliminary tests, the primary and 
secondary loops and the turbine-generator unit of the Qinshan 
nuclear power plant reached satisfactory starting state and the 
major parameters of the main system were attained: outlet steam 
pressure and liquid level of the steam generator, 5.25 MPa and 
11.81m, respectively; average temperature of the main system, 
283C; as well as pressure and liquid level of the 
pressurizer, 15.2 MPa and 8.5m, respectively. 
  1914: The bypass valve of the steam isolation valve was 
opened first. When the steam pressure was equalized, the main 
steam isolation valve was opened. 
  1919: The turbine-generator unit started running, and its 
rotating speed was increased by 100 rpm. When the speed reached 
600 rpm, the unit was allowed to run steadily for a few minutes 
for inspection. Then its speed was increased by 150 rpm. When 
the speed reached 1200 rpm, the unit was maintained steadily at 
that speed for 10 minutes for complete inspection and 
measurement of bearing vibration. When the inspection results 
were considered satisfactory, the speed of the unit was 
increased by 150 rpm, targeting at the rated rotating speed. 
When the speed was being increased, supervision and inspection 
of the unit were enhanced, and bearing vibration was 
continuously measured to pinpoint the critical rotating speed of 
the unit's shaft system. 
  1951: For the first time, the turbine-generator unit of the 
Qinshan nuclear power plant reached the rated speed of 3000 rpm 
and operated steadily at that speed. A series of test data were 
measured and recorded in the following areas: unit vibration, 
metal temperature of cylinders, cylinder expansion, lubricating 
oil temperature and pressure for bearings, as well as the main 
steam pressure, the condenser vacuum and others. During data 
collection, complete inspection of the unit was conducted, and 
no abnormal symptom was observed. Following the standard 
procedure, the unit operation was stopped, and the unit idling 
test was conducted. Inspections were conducted on the automatic 
main steam valve, regulator valve, re-heating main valve and 
re-heating regulator valve, and it was assured that they could 
be readily closed. 
  As the speed was slowing down, the following functions were 
inspected during the idling test: 
  When the rotating speed drops to below 600 rpm, the spray 
cooling device in the low-pressure cylinder must close 
automatically. 
  The rotor vibration indicator is switched to an eccentric 
recorder. 
  The oil temperature controller is re-set from 45C to 
30C. 
  When the speed drops to 200 rpm, the upper shaft oil pump 
must start automatically. 
  When the speed reaches 0 rpm, the rolling gear starts 
normally. 
<H5>  6. Test Results </H5>
  After the tests of increasing speed for 22 minutes, steady 
speed for 12 minutes and idling for 48 minutes, the first run-up 
test of the turbine-generator unit was successfully completed at 
2041. 
  Figure 2 shows the variation of speed increase and idling 
with time. Figure 3 shows the variation of main system coolant 
temperature with time. Figure 4 shows the variations of pressure 
and liquid level in the pressurizer with time. Figure 5 shows 
the variations of outlet steam pressure and liquid level of the 
steam generator with time. Figure 6 shows the curves for the 
measured critical rotor rotation speed of the turbine-generator 
unit. 















<H5>  7. Conclusion </H5>
  The first run-up success of the Qinshan nuclear power plant 
was primarily the result of the cooperative efforts of all the 
participating departments. This successful first attempt shows 
that the design, manufacture, installation, and de-bugging of 
the turbine-generator unit were successful. 
  The turbine generator run-up with non-nuclear steam also 
marks the first consolidated de-bugging test of the primary and 
secondary loops at the Qinshan nuclear power plant. Its success 
also validates that the interface between the nuclear island and 
conventional island in the field of technology, heat 
engineering, control device, electrical engineering is becoming 
a normal event. 
  The success of the non-nuclear steam run-up of turbine 
generator not only saves capital investment cost, but also 
brings new experience to nuclear power construction in China.

Guoli [2621 0948 0448]] 
  [Text] Qinshan, 16 Dec (XINHUA) -- China will develop 
nuclear power on many fronts, and within 20 to 30 years will 
create a line of nuclear power plants that will ease the energy 
crunch. 
  A high-level official of the Chinese nuclear industry said 
today that the nuclear power industry hopes to build multi-unit 
nuclear power bases along the coast. The economic prosperity of 
the coastal areas makes the poverty of energy resources in those 
areas all the more striking. 
  Experts estimate that by 2020, installed nuclear power 
capacity on the mainland could reach 20,000MW, raising its 
proportion of the total annual electric power output of the 
country from the presently weak 1 percent up to about 5 percent. 
  China's energy resources are unevenly distributed, and the 
shortage of energy resources in the eastern and southern areas 
is particularly evident. Economic, safe, and clean nuclear power 
is one way to end the energy crisis, and reduce the 
transportation pressures and the harmful environmental effects 
caused by thermal power. China will pursue an electric power 
development strategy of "lead with thermal and hydropower, 
supplement with nuclear power," and will give consideration to 
building more nuclear power plants in the coastal areas. 
  In their individual development of nuclear power plants, 
Zhejiang and Guangdong have been very constructive. Other 
coastal provinces that are now expressing their interest in 
building nuclear power plants are: Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hainan, 
and Shandong, some already making early-stage preparations, and 
others proceeding with commercial discussions. The development 
of China's nuclear power industry will be done cautiously. The 
official added that financing is China's biggest problem because 
of the high costs and long construction periods required. 
Investment resources for future nuclear power construction must 
come from many sources, through national and local investments, 
raising money locally, bank loans, and foreign loans and export 
credits. 
  China welcomes foreign investments as a means to speed up 
electric power construction through joint ventures with foreign 
investors, or independent investments in thermal and hydropower 
projects, but whether foreign investments can be accepted in the 
nuclear power arena hasn't been decided yet.

  [Text] Qinshan, 15 Dec (XINHUA) -- Since joining the grid 
in 1991, the Qinshan nuclear power plant, China's first 
domestically designed, built, and managed nuclear power plant, 
has earned praise for its safety and reliability of operations 
as it rapidly and smoothly regulates its operating loads, all 
neat and clean, and free of environmental pollution and 
transportation pressures. So far this year, the plant has 
generated 1.62 billion kWh of electric power, already beating 
the annual plan by 200 percent, and operating as it is, at a 
load factor of 64 percent, it is two years ahead of its planned 
annual performance capability. 
  The first load of concrete for the Qinshan nuclear power 
plant was poured on 20 March 1985, and 81 months later, on 15 
December 1991, it was successfully tested on the grid. Last 
July, after reaching full-power operations, its facilities were 
completely realigned, and the plant was brought up to its 
maximum operating capability. On 12 March this year, the plant 
was again successfully operated on the grid, and on 25 June its 
100-hour "examination and acceptance test" was completed without 
a hitch. The plant is now well into its high-operational stage, 
generating up to 7.2 million kWh per day. 
  An official of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Corporation told 
reporters that since the plant joined the grid two years ago it 
has generated 2.145 billion KWh of electric power, exceeding the 
original plan. There have been no harmful effects to the 
facilities, personnel, or the environment. The Environmental 
Surveillance Department reports that the amount of radiation 
from waste water discharged into the environment is less than 
the limit of one part per thousand set by the State, and the 
volume of discharged inert gases is about at allowable limit of 
one part per 100,000, which proves that the operation of the 
Qinshan nuclear power plant is clean, safe, and economical.

Youxin [1728 0645 2450]] 
  [Text] Haiyan, 15 Dec -- The Qinshan nuclear power plant, 
China's first domestically designed and built nuclear power 
plant, which is located in Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, has 
generated a total of 2.145 billion kWh of electricity since it 
joined the grid on 15 December 1991 up until 15 December 1993, 
and especially in the last year, it has produced 1.62 billion 
kWh, 207.7 percent over its planned annual output, and operating 
at a load factor of 64.46 percent, it is two years ahead of its 
planned operating capability. 
  Two years of safe and stable operations of this plant 
demonstrates that China is fully capable of self-development in 
nuclear power. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Corporation which runs 
the plant, has adhered a strict policy of "quality and safety 
first," and has been persistent in scientific management, and in 
multi-level training of its personnel. It fully completed every 
aspect of its debugging mission in two years, getting an 
excellent high rate of operational efficiency out of its 300MW 
units. The daily output of its units is now 7.2 million kWh, and 
the plant has entered full operational test stage. 
  The latest statistics from the environmental monitoring 
department shows that the radiation level from particles in 
waste water discharge is 0.015 Curies, less than the nationally 
specified limit (20 Curies) of one to one-thousand parts; 
chimney discharge of inert gases totalled 0.70 Curies, or just 
at the state-set limit (70,000 Curies) of one to 100,000 parts.

  [Summary] The Nuclear Power Institute of China (NPIC) has 
made encouraging progress on the AC-600 pressurized-water 
reactor (PWR), a key science and technology issue of the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan. 
  The development of China's industry and agriculture requires 
energy and while the development of nuclear power is attracting 
more and more attention from the Party and the State, growth in 
this area is restricted by the industrial base and by the 
State's financial resources. As a result, the State hopes to 
develop a next-generation PWR that will be safer, simpler, and 
more economical. 
  Since 1986, experts and S&amp;T personnel from NPIC have 
learned 
from China's successful nuclear power research and design and 
have intensely followed the leading edge technologies of 
improved foreign reactors; they have now completed the research 
and design process for an improved 600MWe PWR, the AC-600. This 
reactor has a core with a higher safety margin, less complicated 
systems, and non-dynamic systems safety measures which have 
earned the approval of international atomic energy organizations. 
  It is now known that the conceptual design was completed in 
1987, and the independent feasibility study for the AC-600 was 
completed in 1990, pushing forward the 1991-1995 development 
plan; the China Nuclear Industry Corporation and the State 
Science and Technology Commission have both signed off on this 
plan. 
  According to this plan, in 1995 the NPIC will have completed 
the testing and analysis of the overall design of the AC-600 
reactor, the low flow velocity, critical heat flow density, and 
other crucial items. To date, the key item in the overall 
design, the critical heat flow density, has been completed and 
the three non-dynamic safety systems are being assembled with a 
projected date of completion of 1995; work on other items is on 
schedule. Based on preliminary analysis and the current 
developmental work, the AC-600 could be China's next-generation 
PWR power plant in the year 2000.

  [Text] China is speeding nuclear power plant construction 
to fuel its dynamic economic growth. 
  By the year 2000, the country's nuclear power plants will 
have a capacity of 6 million kilowatts while new plants with 
another 6 million kilowatts in capacity will be under 
construction. You Deliang, a spokesman of the China National 
Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), said yesterday. 
  China's first nuclear power station, at Qinshan in Zhejiang 
Province, is now safely and efficiently operating, You added. 
  And, by the end of this year, experts predict it will have 
generated 1.73 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since it 
was linked to the national grid in December 1991. 
  Work on Qinshan's second phase, two generators with a 
capacity of 600,000 kilowatts each, has also begun. 
  Meanwhile, Generator No 1 at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Station is expected to go into commercial operation soon, while 
Generator No 2 will go into commercial operation before next 
June. 
  Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, near Shenzhen in Guangdong, 
is the country's first joint-venture nuclear power plant. 
  Its two generators are designed to generate 10 to 12.6 
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, he said. 
  The power will be sold to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong 
to 
support their economic development. 
  CNNC President Jiang Xinxiong said the establishment of the 
two power stations was a milestone for China's nuclear power 
industry. 
  The Chinese began late in this field and must strive to make 
advances to fuel the country's economic growth, he said. 
  China's booming economy has also provided a huge market for 
nuclear energy, Jiang said. 
  Provinces, especially in Southeast China's coastal areas, 
consider nuclear power an important means to meet their 
increasing energy demands. 
  Jiang said the corporation had also made big strides in 
developing nuclear fuel. 
  A production line, introduced from France to produce pressed 
water reactor (PWR) nuclear fuel has been built and is due to go 
into production next year. 
  Jiang said CNNC's industrial output in 1993 rose 37.7 
percent 
compared to last year. In addition, CNNC is trying to grab a 
share of the international market by exporting its nuclear power 
generators. 
  Pakistan is negotiating with China to import a second 
300,000-kilowatt generator now that the first one is being built.

  [Text] Guangzhou--Guangdong officials have revealed plans 
to build two more nuclear power plants. 
  Zhu Senlin, the provincial governor, said yesterday that 
construction will soon begin on a nuclear power plant in 
Yangjiang and on the second phase of the newly-build Daya Bay 
reactor. 
  He made the remarks at the ongoing Provincial People's 
Congress. 
  The second phase of the Daya Bay plant is set to begin late 
this year. It includes installation of two units each with a 
capacity of 900,000 kilowatts. 
  Situated five kilometers away from the main plant, the 
generators are expected to be in operation within five years. 
  The plant in the coastal city of Yangjiang is expected to 
cost over 6 billion yuan ($689.6 million) and have four units 
with a combined capacity of 4 million kilowatts. Construction on 
the project is expected to begin in the next two years and it is 
expected to begin operation before 2000. 
  When the three plants come on line, Guangdong will have a 
nuclear power installation capacity of 10 million kilowatts. 
  The Guangdong provincial government has begun to raise funds 
for the two nuclear projects, which will cost several billions 
of dollars. 
  Advanced equipment and technology imported from abroad will 
be used, Zhu said. 
  "We also intend to build a fourth and the fifth nuclear 
power 
plant to sustain the province's economic boom, but we have to 
wait for the approval of the central government," the governor 
added. 
  The electricity supply in Guangzhou is 30 percent short of 
demand. 
  Guangdong's first nuclear power plant, the Daya Bay plant in 
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, opened on February 6, when its 
first nuclear power generator started operation. 
  The $4 billion plant has two nuclear power generating units 
with a capacity of 900,000 kilowatts each. Its second set of 
units will come on stream in the next four months. 
  Developed by Guangdong and Hong Kong, the plant will 
generate 
10 billion kilowatt hours every year. However, only 30 percent 
of the electricity will be supplied to the provincial power 
grid. The rest will be sold to Hong Kong to repay overseas loans 
totalling $3.6 billion. 
  The Daya plant was designed by the French and uses reactors 
and other equipment imported from France and Britain. 
  China's first nuclear station, Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant 
in 
East China's Zhejiang Province, began operation in 1991. 
  The station, with a capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, was 
designed by China.

  [Text] The Ministry of Electric Power made a point the 
other day that since the advent of reforms, the Chinese electric 
power industry has had great success in making use of foreign 
loans. By the end of 1992, up to US$11.9 billion in loans and 
gifts from foreign governments, including export credit and 
mixed loans, have been used in foreign cooperative endeavors. 
  Zhao Xizheng, vice minister of the Ministry of Electric 
Power, said that the above-mentioned loans, aid, export credit, 
and mixed loans came from the World Bank, Japan Overseas 
Foundation, Asian Development Bank, Kuwait-Arab Development 
Foundation, Canada, France, Norway, Germany, Australia, the UK, 
Sweden, Russia, Austria, the U.S., Spain, Belgium, Denmark, and 
Finland. Through the use of this US$11.9 million, 55 projects 
have been completed or are now under construction, including 23 
thermal power plant projects, 16 hydropower station projects, 1 
nuclear power plant, and 5 power transmission projects. The 
total installed electric power capacity of new plant 
construction is up to 33,720MW, 8,000MW of which is now in 
operation. 
  Foreign loans have not only accelerated electric power 
construction in China, but they have raised the level of 
construction and operational management and the economic 
performance of the electric power industry. The World Bank, 
which partly funded the construction of the Yunnan Lubuge 
hydropower station, was the first project partner brought into 
China, and the Chinese power construction units, having survived 
that very painful resurrection, promptly went on to build the 
pumped-storage hydropower station in Guangzhou at a pace of 
construction that is without rival. The power plants being built 
with foreign loans and imported facilities have been ushering in 
a parade of safe, economic, and sophisticated units that have 
enabled the Chinese electric power industry to realize an annual 
average reduction in consumption of 3 grams of standard coal per 
kWh for several years running. 
  In addressing the future development of China's electric 
power industry, Zhao Xizheng said that the only way out of the 
money shortage that is inhibiting the large-scale development of 
the power industry is to find more ways to raise funds. To do 
this, the Ministry of Electric Power will continue to encourage 
foreign investments in China through independent ventures, 
joint-ventures, cooperative endeavors, or any other means to get 
electric power, and it will support local governments and 
electric power enterprises in securing more foreign investment. 
New forms of finance, such as alliance funding, and common 
international forms like BOT and BOOT will also be encouraged, 
and other new ways to secure loans must be found. In a word, 
there will have to be some breakthroughs in the use of foreign 
loans.

  [Text] In order to turn Guizhou Province into an important 
southern energy base, and hasten the economic development of the 
people in its mountainous areas, national government 
organizations have turned their thoughts and plans toward giving 
every assist and support for speeding up construction of 
Guizhou's energy, transportation, and telecommunications bases, 
and toward getting on with a number of accelerated development 
projects that need to be finished. 
  Guizhou is the coal bin for all of the nine southern 
provinces, and rapid development of its coal reserves will go a 
long way to solving the coal shortages in the other provinces. 
The new projects selected for construction are the 2.4 million 
ton Panbei coal-dressing plant, the 900,000 ton Dawan shaft 
mine, the 1.8 million ton Jinwa mine, and the 4 million ton 
Feitian mine at Zhijin. The decision has also been made to 
expand the Dahebian coal mine from 600,000 tons to 1.2 million 
tons, and the Tucheng mine from 1.2 million to 2.4 million tons. 
  Guizhou has complementary advantages in coal and hydropower, 
which makes it a major source of energy for the south. 
Construction of the 1,200MW Anshun power plant will get underway 
next year, and ground breaking for the Hongjiadu power plant 
with 540MW of installed capacity is in sight. Early-stage 
preparations are also being made for the 680MW Sanbanxi power 
plant, 600MW Duyun power plant, 2,000MW Goubitan power plant, 
and the 840MW Silin power plant. 
  On the transportation scene, accelerated construction of the 
Nan Kun rail line, work on the Xiaoyunshang to Shuicheng, and 
Huangtong to Zhijin lines, and early preparations for the Duyun 
to Maolan line are all going on at the same time. In addition to 
that, construction will soon be underway on the first-class 
highways from Shanghai to Wanding (passing through Yuping, 
Guiyang, Anshun, Xingyi in Guizhou and into Yunnan), and from 
Chongqing to Nanning (passing through Zunyi, Guiyang, Duyun, and 
Mawei in Guizhou, and on into Guangxi). National authorities are 
also interested in construction of airports, such as the 
Longdongbao international airport now being built, and which, it 
is hoped, will be open to traffic in 1996, and small airports in 
other places for which early preparatory work is underway. 
  Progress has been slow on construction of telecommunications 
in Guizhou. It was decided that in the "Eighth 5-Year Plan," two 
major cable lines would be built through Guizhou, one from 
Nanning to Kunming (passing through Xingyi, Anlong and Ceheng in 
Guizhou), and from Fuzhou to Chongqing (passing through Tongren, 
Kaili, Duyun, Guiyang, and Zunyi in Guizhou). These two lines, 
and the line from Guiyang to Xingyi that Guizhou will build 
itself, will greatly improve telecommunications to most places 
in Guizhou, and efforts are being made to get an 800,000-user 
stored program controlled telephone system with telephone 
connections to all counties and towns in the province in place 
by the end of the century.

  [Text] Xi'an, 8 Oct (XINHUA) -- Last year 1,750MW of 
installed electric power generating capacity was built and put 
into operation in the northwest, and this year more investments 
were made to step up construction of 10 or more key national 
thermal and hydropower projects, signalling a major new stage of 
development for the northwest electric power industry. 
  Tens of thousands of electric power construction workers in 
Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang are winning the 
battle to tame the wilds of the upper Huang He with a barrage of 
construction sites. Having smoothly diverted the river and 
completed the excavation for the foundation for the 
multi-purpose Lijiaxia hydropower station where four 400MW 
units, the country's largest, will be installed, they began 
pouring the concrete for the 165-meter high dam in April and for 
the main machinery room in July of this year. The units for the 
3,110MW power project are now being installed and will be coming 
on line by year's end. 
  There is a wealth of coal, hydropower and wind power 
resources in the vast territory of the five northwest provinces. 
Since 1986, the northwest has built 11 large and middle-sized 
hydropower stations and thermal power plants, such as the 
Longyangxia and the Jingyuan. By the end of last year, the 
installed capacity of the northwest reached 14,417MW, and annual 
power output reached 60.093 billion kWh, nearly half of which 
was produced by hydropower stations. 
  Hydropower resources development is the main feature of 
electric power construction in the northwest. Hydropower 
stations are being developed at Ankang and Shiquan on the Han 
Jiang in Shaanxi, and at Bikou on the Bailong Jiang in Gansu, 
while Qinghai and Ningxia are joined in an effort to build two 
large-scale cascade hydropower stations on the upper Huang He at 
Longyangxia and Liujiaxia, and three more at Yanluoxia, 
Bapanxia, and Qingtongxia for a total installed capacity of up 
to 3,268MW. The five large-scale reservoirs accompanying these 
stations will irrigate over 16 million mu of agricultural land 
on both sides of the river. The excellent regulating ability of 
these reservoirs has basically solved the flood and ice damage 
problems along the middle and upper reaches of the Huang He, and 
they have clearly improved the ecological environment of the 
northwestern plateau. 
  The latest developmental program worked out by the Northwest 
Power Industry Administrative Bureau and the Northwest 
Hydropower Survey and Design Academy calls for the construction 
of six stations in addition to those already built, and seven 
more large-size stations at Gongbaixia and Laxiwa etc., and 12 
more middle-size cascade stations at Daxia etc., which will 
increase the total installed capacity up to 15,740MW and the 
annual power output up to 57 billion kWh. The schedule has been 
set for construction of 19 new cascade stations on the upper 
Huang He, and it is expected that the development will be 
wrapped up sometime early in the next century. 
  Authorities of the Northwest Power Industry Administrative 
Bureau expect that during the course of these electric power 
construction projects, power generation in the northwest will be 
increased up to 69 billion kWh by 1995.

  [Text] With the national economy in rapid growth, and the 
need to meet the electric power requirements for the second 
round of strategic economic and social targets, the Ministry of 
Electric Power, after readjustments, has set extraordinary 
development targets for 2000: From 1995 to 1997, the average 
annual increase in large and middle-sized power generators will 
be above 15,000MW; from 1998 to 2000, the annual average 
increase will be over 20,000MW, and by the end of this century 
the total national installed capacity, building on the 166,000MW 
foundation at the end of 1992, will reach about 310,000MW, which 
will be about one-fourth more than the original target of 
240,000MW. 
  Experts say that at this rate of growth, if the gross value 
of national economic output can increase at a rate of 8 to 9 
percent per year over the next several years, and social power 
consumption reduces by 8 to 9 percent, China will basically meet 
its target of relieving the power shortage, and electrify all 
counties by the end of the century. 
  To reach these targets, the Ministry of Electric Power will 
observe the policy of "incorporate, commercialize operations, 
and legalize management," and as fast as possible introduce 
enterprise management reforms, and establish modernized 
enterprise system. At the same time it will establish statutes 
(electric power laws), and by the end of the century, establish 
laws and regulations for the electric power industry management 
system that will be appropriate to China's special circumstances 
and the socialist market economy. 
  In 1988, the Chinese electric power industry's newly 
installed capacity reached 12,000MW for the first time, and it 
has continued to reach that target every year for six years. 
This year it could go as high as 15,000MW, with new large and 
middle-sized units increasing by 12,000MW. This way, by year's 
end, the national installed capacity total could reach 
181,000MW, and be the fourth largest in the world.

"Three of the Large Power Groups Set Their Objectives for the 
Year 2000"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Northeast China Electric Power Corporation </H5>
  By the years 2000 and 2010, the Northeast China power system 
will have an installed capacity of respectively 47 million and 
88 million kW, and its output of electricity will reach 
respectively 213 and 400 billion kWh. The new objectives for 
these two steps were recently stated by the Northeast Electric 
Power Group's director general Huang Jinkai [7806 6855 0418] 
during a meeting with reporters. 
  The Northeast China Electric Power Group will build 10 power 
plants distributed through the Heilongjiang coal-fired power 
base, the Eastern Nei Monggol coal-fired power base, and the 
railroad center and port power bases in Liaoning and Jilin, 
giving these three areas newly installed capacities of 12 
million, 36 million, and 17 million kW, respectively. In 
addition, it will use the water resources of the region to build 
large and medium-size hydroelectric stations, including the 
Songjiang River cascade and the Lianhua power plant, and will 
carry on vigorous, safe development of the hydropower resources 
of the main channel of the Heilongjiang River, which forms the 
Sino-Russian border. This extraordinary scale of electric power 
construction will also include nuclear power plants with 
capacities of 10 and 8 million kW and a pumped-storage power 
plant. In addition, extensive refitting of existing 
high-coal-consumption older generator sets will be carried out, 
and as an adjunct to electric power construction, a 500-kV power 
grid covering the entire region will be built. 
  Huang Jinkai stated that in order to carry out the above 
conceptions, the Northeast China Electric Power Group will 
follow the general principles of "a world orientation, extensive 
cooperation, mutual benefit, and joint development," and will 
engage in various types of economic and technical cooperation 
and exchange with domestic and foreign friends in an extensive 
range of activities in order to expand the influx of funds, 
technology, equipment, and management experience into China and 
to strengthen its electric power capabilities. 
  The Northeast China Electric Power Group, an electric power 
consortium, has a fixed capital of 26.7 billion yuan; its 
subordinate organizations include the Jilin Province Electric 
Power Corporation, the Heilongjiang Province Electric Power 
Corporation, 48 generating plants and 33 power delivery 
companies. At the end of 1992, the total installed power 
generating capacity in the Northeast China power grid, which the 
group operates, was 25 million kW. 
<H5>  North China Electric Power Corporation </H5>
  By the year 2000, it is expected that the North China region 
will need an output of between 251 and 278 billion kWh of 
electricity each year, which presupposes an installed generating 
capacity of between 45 and 50 million kW. To meet this need, the 
North China Electric Power Group has decided to add to its 
existing 25 million kW of capacity an additional 17 fossil-fired 
plants with a combined capacity of 35.5 million kW, several 
hydroelectric plants with a combined capacity of up to 1.08 
million kW, and a pumped-storage power plant with a generating 
capacity of 1.4 million kW. 
  This grand program was revealed at a recent meeting by the 
North China Electric Power Group's director general Jiao Yian 
[3542 2011 1344]. In the near term the North China Electric 
Power Group plans to carry out construction projects 
representing a total of more than 600,000 kW of capacity, 
including: stage 2 of the Shalingzi power plant, stage 2 of the 
Ji Xian power plant, the Dou He No 2 power plant, and the Handan 
power plant in Hebei; stage 2 of the Datong No 2 power plant in 
Shanxi; and the Daqi and Daihai power plants in Nei Monggol. 
  Jiao Yian stated that North China's electric power industry 
still falls somewhat short of the world state of the art in its 
technical and management standards and that in order to 
implement its grand development objectives, it will have to 
engage in extensive mutually beneficial economic and technical 
cooperation with many organizations in China and abroad. As a 
consequence, the North China Electric Power Group will 
enthusiastically welcome domestic and foreign friends who wish 
to build power plants in the North China region on a 
single-proprietorship basis or to initiate power industry 
development with sharing of benefits on a joint-capital or 
cooperative basis or by providing loans; the group will also 
engage in cooperation and exchange in the technical sphere and 
in various types of technological and labor cooperation on 
various projects abroad. 
  The North China Electric Power Group is one of the five 
large 
electric power groups that were created in China at the 
beginning of 1993. It is a large enterprise consortium that 
unites electric power production, design, construction, 
adjustment and testing, equipment manufacture and repair, 
research, and education and training organizations, along with 
diversified organizations. It has 250,000 employees, 63 power 
plants, 4 site surveying and design institutes, 19 electric 
power construction companies, 5 electric power research 
organizations, 11 electric power equipment manufacturing or 
repair enterprises, and 12 schools of various types. The North 
China Power Grid, which it operates, supplies electric power to 
Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Nei Monggol, covering a 
total area of 1.47 million square kilometers and serving 120 
million persons. 
<H5>  Central China Power Corporation </H5>
  In the wake of the world-renowned Three Gorges project, 
during the next seven years the Central China power system will 
also build close to 10 hydroelectric power stations and more 
than 30 other generating plants in Hubei, Henan, Hunan and 
Jiangxi, so that by the end of the century the system's 
installed capacity will have doubled to about 50 million kW. 
  This prospect was revealed by Liu Jinlong [0491 6855 7893], 
director general of the Central China Electric Power Group, 
during a recent interview in Beijing. 
  The Central China Electric Power Group, a large consortium 
composed of more than 180 power generation, power delivery, 
construction, equipment manufacture and repair, design, 
research, and educational organizations in Hubei, Henan, Hunan 
and Jiangxi, operates the Central China electric power grid, 
which supplies electric power to these four provinces; its 
coverage is 730,000 square kilometers. By the end of 1992, the 
system's total installed capacity was 24 million kW, and the 
annual output of electricity reached 113.5 million kWh. 
  In order to achieve these goals by the year 2000, Liu 
Jinlong 
stated that the Central China Electric Power Group will warmly 
welcome friends in all fields, both from China and from abroad, 
who wish to invest in the Central China region or to engage in 
technical and economic cooperation. 
  In addition, a nuclear power plant program for the region 
covering the period through 2020 was announced at a recent 
Central China power system long-range planning meeting. 
  According to the development program for the entire Central 
China power system, nuclear power development will begin in 
Jiangxi before the year 2000 and a 1.2-million-kW nuclear power 
plant will be built by 2010. Subsequently, two 3-million-kW 
nuclear power plants will be built in Jiangxi and Hunan by 2020. 
The installed nuclear power generating capacity in the Central 
China system will then be 7.2 million kW; but this figure will 
still represent less than 5 percent of the total generating 
capacity in the grid. 
  The Central China power system, one of China's major power 
systems, covers the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and 
Jiangxi, with a total area of 730 million square kilometers. Its 
current generating capacity is 25.45 million kW and its annual 
output of electricity is 116.1 billion kWh.

Electric Power Industry: "Electric Power Industry Must Take 
Extraordinary Path in Development"] 
  [Text] RENMIN RIBAO has published a series of reports 
revealing the fact that our electric power development cannot 
meet demands of economic growth. How can we get out of the power 
shortage bottleneck that lasted over the past 23 years? 
  We believe that a much more in-depth reform is required in 
order for us to take an extraordinary path. 
  To take a so-called "extraordinary" path is to depart from 
conventional wisdom in order to achieve goals and objectives of 
a socialist market economy. We will have to be determined to 
deal with fundamental issues affecting the growth of our 
electric power industry. Major breakthroughs are needed in 
teaching new concepts, straightening out the production system, 
pushing for a standardized shareholder system, separating 
government from business and converting to a business enterprise 
structure, and establishing a modern electric power industry. 
Particularly, we have to intensify our macroscopic control to 
raise large sums of domestic or foreign capital to invest in 
power plants, accelerate the cost structure, improve our ability 
to repay debt, promote for conservation and efficient 
utilization, significantly improve the profitability of the 
industry, and further unleash the production capacity of the 
industry in order to create the condition for the electric power 
industry to grow in a healthy environment. Therefore, an 
"extraordinary" path not only implies a jump in quantity but 
also in quality, not only in terms of speed but also in 
revamping of mechanism. 
  1. Electric power industry will never get out of the 
bottleneck by conventional approach 
  While the electric power industry can grow following our 
conventional approach in a developing nation such as China, it 
will never be able to catch up with economic needs and personal 
demand. In 1949, mainland China had a total installed capacity 
of 1,860MW and produced 4.3 billion kW of electricity annually. 
Since the founding of the present government and after 40 years 
of hard work, China ranked fourth worldwide in terms of 
installed capacity and annual power production in 1987. By the 
end of 1993, it is estimated that China will have a total 
installed capacity of 180,000MW that produces 800 billion kW of 
electricity annually. The amount of power generated in days now 
is equivalent to that produced in the entire year of 1949. 
  Nevertheless, as the electric power supply increases, the 
power shortage is worsening in most regions in China. The 
constraint imposed by the power shortage is hampering our 
modernization effort. Areas that are prospering usually have the 
fastest development in power supply. However, those are often 
places of severe shortage. 
  It is untrue that government has ignored the electric power 
industry in the past 40 years. Nor can it be attributed to lack 
of substantial investment. We should not underestimate the 
effectiveness of the management system overhaul in the past 
decade. However, in all fairness, these steps did not break away 
from the routine pattern of growth. Most of the reform policies 
and measures are based on the old planned economy system. 
Unavoidably, we are affected by the old framework and cannot 
possibly eliminate all the shortcomings in the old system. These 
shortcomings are preventing the electric power industry from 
taking a leading role. 
  The deficiencies of the old system show up in the structure. 
Primarily, there is no separation of government and industry. 
The electric power industry is affiliated with the government. 
In a planned economy, macroscopic control is always subjective. 
This led to an insufficient level of investment in the electric 
power industry. The development was inadequate in scale. World 
Bank experts believed that a developing nation should invest 
more than 2 percent of its GNP in electric power. However, 
between 1980-1992, we only invested 1.24 percent per year. Past 
experience showed that the normal electric equipment to power 
generator capacity ration is 2:1. However, it has been far 
greater than 2 in China for years. Not only is the actual ratio 
greater than 2 but also the increment is more than 2. Second, 
energy conservation is never a priority issue. There are no 
policies and measures adopted and no energy conservation 
mechanisms and structures established. Society, as a whole, does 
not have a sense of necessity for energy conservation. This 
makes it difficult to promote energy conservation. A serious 
power shortage and a huge waste of electric power exist at the 
same time. Third, ownership is unclear and responsibility and 
authority are not consistently defined. Industry is a part of 
government and employees take industry for granted. For a long 
time, the government has been responsible for collecting and 
paying utility bills. Collection and payment are made by 
different branches of the government. Even after adopting a 
contract system, this has not changed. More than 90 percent of 
the profit of an electric utility goes into the treasury in the 
form of taxes and fees. On the one hand, the electric utility is 
situated between local and central government treasuries. On the 
other hand, industry does not have the ability to invest or 
borrow money. In other countries, some utility companies raise 
more than 50 percent of the funds for basic construction. In 
some cases, it is as high as 90 percent. In China, it is less 
than 5 percent. Because the electric utility is not a truly 
independent producer and operator, and there is no competition, 
the fact that the industry has an excessively large number of 
employees has become a major problem. 
  The old system produced an extremely distorted price 
structure for electric power. It neither reflects its cost nor 
its supply and demand. This irrational cost structure made us 
ignore the fact that electricity is a commodity. The electric 
utility industry competes unfairly with other industries. There 
is no way to establish a fully functional business management 
mechanism. This not only makes it hard to raise money to invest 
in construction, but also hampers efforts to conserve energy and 
suppress excessive demand. It also makes it more difficult to 
reorganize industry to raise foreign capital to build more power 
plants. 
  From the standpoint of the electric power industry, 
conceptually it has been bound by tradition for a long period of 
time. Its understanding of the market economy is lagging. 
Concepts such as market, competition, profitability, investment 
and output are weak and need to be reinforced. 
  2. Extraordinary development requires us to dedicate 
our efforts on deeper reform, mechanism conversion, structure 
optimization and improved profitability. 
  As early as 1975, when Deng Xiaoping [6772 1420 1627] was in 
charge at the State Council, he stressed the need to speed the 
buildup of the electric power industry to meet the demand of a 
growing economy, and to leave some room for the unexpected. To 
implement Deng's instruction is the objective of the electric 
utility industry today. We plan to install more than 15 million 
kW of large and medium generator units annually between 
1995-1997 and to add 20 million kW annually between 1998-2000. 
In addition to expanding our installed capacity, other issues 
related to power generation and power grid technology and 
education will be addressed at the same time. By the end of this 
century, our total installed capacity will reach 310 million 
kilowatts. Assuming a GNP growth rate of 8-9 percent and a 
reduction of power demand per unit product value of 8-10 
percent, power shortage can be alleviated nationally. Every 
county will have power and more than 95 percent of the rural 
areas will have electricity. To accomplish this goal, in-depth 
reform and the taking of "extraordinary" steps are required. 
  The "decision" adopted at the Third Central Committee 
Meeting 
of the 14th Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party signified that 
our economic reform had entered an overall, accelerated and 
coordinated phase. The recently held national economic workshop 
accelerated the pace of reform and introduced a large number of 
measures. It is an excellent opportunity for the electric 
utility industry to take "extraordinary" steps. To take 
advantage of this opportunity, the main strategy is that the 
industry must actively reorganize to a corporation structure and 
operate as a business. 
  A corporation structure is a beneficial tool to build a 
modern electric power industry. The core is to build a modern 
electric enterprise system that can adapt to the need of a 
market economy, has a clear ownership, responsibility and 
authority, and separates government from industry, and is 
managed scientifically. The eventual outcome in a market economy 
is that the electric power industry must operate as a business. 
The core is centered around the concept of electricity as a 
commodity. We have to create a competitive environment and allow 
the industry to operate independently in accordance with laws 
and regulations. It will become an economic entity that is 
responsible for its own profitability, growth and control. This 
is also a way to standardize a shareholder ownership system. 
  A shareholder ownership system is a better way to organize 
and operate a business that suits the needs of a 
product-oriented society and requires a great deal of 
investment. It is widely used around the world. It is an 
organization that also meets the basic requirement of public 
ownership in a socialist society and is an effective way for the 
electric utility industry to grow in an "extraordinary" manner. 
On the basis of the status and mission facing the electric power 
industry, it is far more urgent to try out the shareholder 
ownership system. The first objective is to convert the 
mechanism. The key to its success depends on how strictly 
standardization can be done. A standardized shareholder 
ownership system, in essence, must take our special situation 
into account. It has to follow the normal rules and regulations 
of a socialist market economy and our unique situation that 
production, supply and sales happen simultaneously. It must be 
consistent with the general requirements concerning shareholder 
ownership and obey the "20-Word" policy governing the reform and 
development of the electric power industry. It should 
fundamentally liberate the productivity of the entire power 
industry. 
  In 1987, the State Council issued the following guideline 
and 
principle for the reform and development of electric utilities; 
i.e., separation of business and government, using provincial 
grids as operating entities, connecting all grids, centralizing 
power dispatching, collectively raising capital for 
construction, and taking individual special situations into 
consideration. In practice, this turns out to be an excellent 
guideline, consistent with our unique situation and existing 
pattern in the electric power industry. It systematically 
unveiled the approach to solve our power shortage problem in 
steps. In a socialist market economy, separation of business and 
government is a direction we must insist on in order to reform 
and develop the industry. "Using the provincial power grid as an 
entity to connect all power grids" is a product of the objective 
pattern in industry growth and actual economic management in 
China today. Essentially, it stresses that an inter-provincial 
or provincial power grid must be an independent economic entity. 
At the same time, it is also a collective body of mutual 
interest for a number of parties. "Centralized dispatch" is 
determined by the internal power production pattern. The 
complete concept should be "centralized dispatch and layered 
management." Raising money to invest in power plants is a major 
accomplishment in the reform of our electric power industry. To 
build up the electric utilities ahead of the game requires us to 
take full advantage of capital available both domestically and 
internationally. Fundraising must also be perfected toward a 
higher level, such as joint ventures and standardized 
shareholder ownership, within a socialist market economy 
structure. A standardized shareholder ownership is a better way 
to raise money to build up the industry. It is more powerful 
than making an investment or arranging a loan because it can 
effectively attract domestic and foreign funds. It can clearly 
sort out the ownership of a complicated production entity 
through a standardized shareholder system. Legally, it ensures a 
true separation of ownership and operating authority to protect 
the legal rights of the investors and the legitimacy of the 
operator. This move will help standardize the way investment in 
power plant construction is made and the way foreign investment 
is treated. It will facilitate the government to authorize other 
parties to operate its business to improve efficiency and thus 
secures the appreciation of existing nationally owned 
enterprises. "Do what is suitable to the occasion and place" is 
a principle we must follow in implementing the reform and 
development plan for the electric power industry. As long as we 
insist on being practical, we ought to be able to find a way to 
standardize the ownership of the local power grid to place the 
industry on a healthy growth track. 
  Under the "20-Word" guideline, a standardized shareholder 
ownership may be in a variety of forms. However, regardless of 
the form, all participants must be voluntary. For example, in 
addition to a standardized shareholder ownership-based 
provincial power grid, with the approval of a higher authority, 
a number of power plants managed by investors themselves or by 
other industries may be allowed to operate in parallel on the 
grid as well. Nevertheless, they must sign an agreement with the 
power grid that protects their rights and specifies their 
responsibilities. Furthermore, on the basis of local economic 
growth conditions and with the approval of a higher authority in 
charge of electric utilities a more flexible shareholder 
arrangement may be experimented in a limited region, such as 
cities and counties along the eastern seaboard. This region may 
be called the electric utility "developing region." Hopefully, 
local governments will provide certain incentives to encourage 
power plant construction as well. Investors should take 
advantage of such incentives and invest more in power plant 
construction to produce a higher annual growth rate and create a 
mechanism for future projects. This is an important measure that 
will encourage an economically growing region to build up its 
own electric power and perfect its own power grid. 
  3. Strong leadership, daring experimentation and steady 
pace are required to march toward a standardized shareholder 
ownership system. 
  After a decade of reform and open market policy, there is a 
solid foundation for a standardized shareholder ownership 
system. However, as a whole, our reform is still very primitive 
and unbalanced. Shareholder ownership should be experimented in 
more competitive and higher quality industries first to produce 
the desired results. The experience gained can then be used to 
guide the rest of the nation. Other industries must be patient 
to create the necessary conditions. We must proceed steadily and 
prevent a stampede. 
  Industries that are earmarked as test points for shareholder 
ownership must rigorously follow the procedures and regulations 
issued by the government and proceed step by step according to 
plan. On the basis of the "20-Word" policy and the "suitability 
to occasion and location" principle, an industry must find a 
format that suits its specific situation. The focal point is to 
study the organization of the shareholder structure. 
  Every electric utility must have a solid organization as a 
modern business. The organization must function perfectly for 
the purpose of conducting business. We must make sure that the 
State Council set aside a certain amount of our national 
infrastructure investment fund for a national electric utility 
industry corporation as its capital in order to strengthen its 
ability to borrow money elsewhere. It will be part of the power 
grid construction fund that will be loaned to the electric 
utility corporation to build key grids. It will handle the 
borrowing, repayment of principal and interest, and the 
construction and management of key power grids. Key power grids 
must be 100-percent controlled by the electric utility 
corporation and loans will be directly obtained from the 
national development bank. Existing government-owned capital in 
electric utility needs to be liquidated. For example, after 
adopting a price structure that pays back principal and 
interest, the money collected should be reinvested in other 
projects managed by the industry. Existing and added capacity of 
the power grid must be managed by the electric power industry. 
Investment in large key power plants built for peak-saving and 
load leveling, including water pumping storage power plants and 
nuclear power plants, should be made by the electric utility 
corporation with government funds so that the utility company 
can effectively control and directly manage such plants on 
behalf of the government. On this basis, a national electric 
utility corporation should be established. 
  We must insist on the principle of having a single grid 
control system and many electric utility companies. Under the 
premise that safe operation of the grid is ensured, other 
internal standardized shareholder ownership systems may be 
explored. Domestic and foreign investors will be encouraged to 
build power plants either with controlling interest or as a 
shareholder. However, investment and loan must be separated. If 
it is an investment, then it is entitled to dividends. If it is 
a loan, then its principal and interest should be repaid. The 
investor has an option to choose. 
  In the next seven years, the electric power industry needs 
$25 billion. This corresponds to importing 45 million kW of 
equipment. To this end, in addition to loans obtained from 
foreign governments, international monetary agencies and 
commercial credits, it is also necessary to attract direct 
foreign investment, free up tied-up capital and encourage joint 
ventures and other collaborative effort to construct more power 
plants. We have to establish and perfect rules and regulations 
that govern the use of foreign investment on power plant 
construction and strengthen our control over this matter. Our 
own national interest should always come first. We must provide 
solid leadership and rigorous supervision to make sure that 
risks are shared. We should avoid paying an excessively high or 
a fixed rate of return to put us in a disadvantageous position. 
  Reform is the driving force behind liberation and 
development. In order to liberate and develop the output of the 
electric utility industry to put it in the lead, we must fully 
mobilize the resources in our central and local government. This 
is the key to a successful reform. 
  To realize such an "extraordinary" growth in the electric 
utility industry, and to better serve our economy, we must work 
together as a whole under the leadership of the Party Central 
and the State Council and be persistent until our objectives are 
met.

  [Text] China is hoping that co-operation with foreign 
engineering companies will help provide more large-capacity 
generators to meet the country's rising demand for power. 
  Foreign companies are welcome to invest in the production of 
thermal, hydroelectric and nuclear power-generating equipment, 
according to official sources. 
  Attracted by the country's huge market for power stations, 
foreign big names in the industry are eagerly searching China 
for co-operative partners. 
  Giants like ABB, Siemens, General Electric and Westinghouse 
Electric are negotiating with Chinese manufacturers to set up 
joint ventures in the country. 
  A joint venture between Siemens AG of Germany and Dongfang 
Electric Co., a major electrical machinery producer based in 
Southeast China's Sichuan Province, is awaiting approval from 
authorities. 
  The main problem in Sino-foreign co-operation is the 
question 
of who will hold the majority of shares in the joint ventures. 
Chinese and foreign sides both demand controlling stakes in 
their joint ventures. 
  The issue is crucial, since setting up joint ventures in 
China is one strategy for foreign companies to use in winning 
contracts for the Three Gorges project, the world's largest 
hydroelectric project. 
  The huge project revolves around 26 hydroelectric generating 
units, each with a capacity of 700,000 kilowatts. China hopes 
that these generators will be produced co-operatively by Chinese 
and foreign companies. 
  According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of 
Machinery Industry, China's power generator production reached 
12.78 million kilowatts last year, an increase of 7.7 percent 
over the previous year. 
  But production still lags behind domestic demand, said Xu 
Lianyi, director of the ministry's Department of Major 
Industrial Equipment. 
  The government plans to raise total installed capacity from 
last year's 180 million kilowatts to 280 million to 300 million 
kilowatts by the end of the century. 
  This means that in the next seven years China must install 
generators with the capacity of 100 million to 120 million 
kilowatts. 
  To do this, the ministry has to approve the production of 
more than 14 million kilowatts annually, Xu said. 
  He said that the biggest obstacle for domestic manufacturers 
is the shortage of money, which will hamper planned production 
this year. 
  Chinese-made generators cost only half the price of imported 
units, but since domestic manufacturers earn little in profits 
they cannot raise enough capital for future development. 
  Still, in recent years China has exported generators worth 
$230 million to developing countries, including Pakistan, 
Bangladesh and Indonesia.

<F P=106> [Article by Chang Weimin: "State Vows To Reduce Pollution"] </F>
  [Text] China's power industry is to concentrate on the 
development of resources that produce less pollution. 
  Efforts to tap hydro and wind resources will be encouraged, 
according to an official from the Ministry of Power Industry. 
  In 2000, hydropower generating capacity will account for 26 
percent of the country's total, compared with 24 percent at 
present. 
  That means hydropower generating capacity will climb to 75 
to 
80 million kilowatts that year. The capacity at the end of 1992 
stood at 40.7 million kilowatts. 
  The industry expects to increase its power generating 
capacity to 310 million kilowatts in 2000 from the present 170 
million kilowatts. 
  The majority of electricity in China is generated by 
coal-fired power plants, which emit minute sulphur particles 
that contaminate the environment. 
  But several hydropower stations, with capacity totalling 20 
million kilowatts, are under construction. 
  Of them, a group capable of producing 9 million kilowatts 
were kicked off this year. 
  Jiang Shaojun, the ministry's spokesman, predicted 148 
billion kilowatt-hours would be generated by hydropower stations 
this year, compared with 134.5 billion in 1992. 
  Development of other energy sources, such as wind power, is 
also to be pushed forward, Jiang said. 
  The industry will strive to gain a capacity of 1 million 
kilowatts by using wind power. 
  In windy North China, especially the country's northwestern 
provinces and autonomous regions, wind generators are common. 
  In the meantime, the industry will make major measures to 
reduce pollution from thermal power plants. 
  The measures are significant as coal-firing plants will 
remain the mainstay of the industry for the rest of the century. 
  Installing waste-recycling systems in old power stations is 
very expensive. 
  But new thermal plants will be designed to reduce or 
eliminate pollution. 
  However, the official admitted that as a developing nation, 
China needs time to reach anti-pollution standards set by the 
Western nations. 
  The industry has made special efforts to raise the 
standards. 
  The industry has begun co-operation with the Japanese 
Government to treat sulphur-rich coal and smoke from coal-fired 
thermal power plants. 
  The industry will use funds from the Japanese Government for 
several projects. 
  Two sulphur treatment projects are under way in Huangdao, 
Shandong Province, and Taiyuan, Shanxi Province. 
  As for the nuclear power sector, another official from the 
ministry said several new plants are under consideration. 
  "We attach strict anti-radiation standards to our nuclear 
plants," the official said. 
  China has two nuclear power stations, one in Zhejiang 
Province that is already in operation and the other in Guangdong 
Province that is to go into operation this year. 
  Capacity of the two stations totals 2.1 million kilowatts. 
  No other nuclear power plants are likely to go into 
operation 
until after 2000. 
  However, construction of at least three could be kicked off 
before the end of the century, the official said. 
  China, where nuclear power generation is in its beginning 
phase, is seeking moderate development in this sector.

  [Text] China has been short of electricity for 23 years. 
Now it must "break with convention" and reform its power 
industry, said Power Industry Minister Shi Dazhen, in PEOPLE'S 
DAILY (December 19). Excerpts follow: 
  When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the 
mainland had an installed electricity capacity of only 1.86 
million kilowatts, and it could generate just 4.3 billion 
kilowatt hours a year. 
  By the end of this year, China's installed capacity is 
expected to have passed 180 million kilowatts, with an annual 
supply of more than 800 billion kilowatt hours. The amount of 
electricity China generates in two days now is equal to the 
total for the whole of 1949. 
  But as industries expand and people use more electricity, 
the 
shortage of power in most parts of the country gets worse. The 
industry has developed most in areas with higher economic 
growth, but these places are also the hardest hit by the power 
shortage. 
  It is unfair to say that the State has overlooked the 
problem 
and achievements made in reforming the power industry's 
management should never be underestimated. 
  But most reform measures and policies in this sector were 
drawn up within the framework of the traditional planned economy 
and it is inevitable they bear the stamp of the old system. 
<H5>  Investment </H5>
  Conventionally, enterprises in the power industry are 
subsidiaries of administrative organs. They tend to be 
controlled by arbitrary orders, which can mean poor investment. 
  The World Bank suggests developing countries invest more 
than 
2 percent of the gross national product (GNP) in the power 
industry. But from 1980 to 1992, China put in an average of only 
1.24 percent of GNP. 
  Energy-saving policies and measures are also inadequate and 
the public lacks a strong sense of energy conservation. The huge 
shortage of electricity thus co-exists with massive waste. 
  For a long time, the State has demanded enterprises in the 
power industry hand in more than 90 percent of their revenue in 
taxes and profit turnover. This leaves them little cash to keep 
going and the enterprises can afford no more than 5 percent of 
their revenue to invest in development. 
  By contrast, their foreign counterparts raise about half the 
cash they invest themselves and in some countries the figure is 
up to 90 percent. 
  Because enterprises in China's power industry are not 
independent commodity producers and managers, they do not feel 
the pressure of competition. Most have long had more workers 
than they need. 
  In the old system, electricity prices were unreasonably low 
which has caused unequal competition between enterprises in the 
power industry and those in other sectors. 
  This leads to waste which affects fundraising and the 
introduction of foreign investment. 
  China's power industry is, however, trying to keep pace with 
and even overtake the growth of the national economy. 
  From 1995 to 1997, the government plans to increase the 
generating capacity of large and medium-sized power stations by 
more than 15 million kilowatts a year. The figure for 1998-2000 
is 20 million kilowatts. 
  If these goals are met, China's total installed electric 
capacity will hit around 310 million kilowatts by the turn of 
the century. This will ease the shortage nationwide and put 
electricity within the reach of every county and 95 percent of 
rural households. 
  To fulfill the goal, the power industry must break with 
conventional practices. 
  Modern power enterprises should be set up. They should be 
free from government interference, be given decision-making 
powers and assume sole responsibility for profits and losses. 
Their property rights, and rights and obligations should be 
clearly defined. 
  The package also includes efforts to drum into the public 
the 
need to save electricity. Enterprises in the power industry 
should also be allowed to compete on an equal footing with 
enterprises in other sectors. 
<H5>  Shareholding </H5>
  The power industry would further be helped by the 
introduction of the shareholding system. This sophisticated form 
of fundraising can separate managerial power from ownership and 
help protect the legal rights of both investors and managers. 
  In the next seven years, the power industry will need $25 
billion to import electricity generating units with a capacity 
of 45 million kilowatts. 
  Besides foreign loans, foreign investment is welcome and 
overseas investors are encouraged to build solely-funded or 
co-funded power plants. 
  As investors, they can draw dividends according to their 
investment. As loan lenders, they will recoup both the loan and 
interest.

University, Tianjin 300071: "Research on Nickel/Metal Hydride 
Battery," supported by grant from 863 Plan; MS received 11 Sep 
93, revised 12 Nov] 
  [Abstract] By applying the nation's abundant rare-earth 
resources, a new type of hydrogen storage electrode alloy--and 
from it, a high-performance AA-size sealed nickel/metal hydride 
(Ni-MH) battery--have been developed. This new high-tech 
product, the subject of competitive research and 
commercialization in the U.S., Japan, Germany, and other 
advanced nations, has several advantages over Ni/Cd batteries, 
including higher capacity, avoidance of Cd pollution, and 
larger-current charging and discharging. The 863AA Ni/MH 
battery developed by the authors has the following key 
performance indicators: nominal capacity exceeds 1000 mAh, 5-A 
discharge-to-0.8-V average capacity exceeds 950mAh (95 percent 
of rated capacity), low-temperature (-18C) 0.2-A 
discharge-to-1.0-V average capacity is 835 mAh (83 percent of 
rated capacity), seven-day self-discharge is 15 percent, 28-day 
self-discharge is 29 percent, and lifetime is over 500 cycles 
(based on 1.75-h 400-mA charge, 1.25-h 400-mA discharge test). 
These parameters meet international standards, and 
low-temperature performance is state of the art. The authors 
have completed batch trial-production, and have constructed an 
intermediate-testing base with a single-shift annual output of 
500,000 units [for details, see JPRS-CEN-93-006, 23 Jun 93, p 
23]. 
The one figure, not reproduced, is a graph of voltage drops over 
time for five different charge levels ranging from 200 mA to 
5000 mA. There are no tables.

  [Text] In 1993, Jiangsu Province added 2 million kilowatts 
in generating capacity, bringing its total on-line capacity 
above 10 million kilowatts. In the last several years, Jiangsu 
has experienced a growing gap in electric power supply and 
demand which has severely impacted industrial and agricultural 
output as well as the standard of living. As a result, the 
province has placed a priority on power development, beefing up 
the construction of the power infrastructure. In 1993, 2.38 
billion yuan were invested in the province's power sector. Of 
this amount, 749 million yuan came from the State, 1.19 billion 
came from the province, 376 million yuan came from Huaneng and 
other energy resources investment companies, and 65 million yuan 
from foreign investors.

Countermeasures--An Assessment of China's New Energy Resource 
Strategy and a Discussion of Countermeasures"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: We cannot just sit idly by 
looking at the variety of actions that all countries of the 
world have taken to develop new energy resources and the 
strategic trends they have revealed. They show us that a large 
energy-consuming nation that basically has a single energy 
resource structure composed of coal must take notice of the 
prospects and significance of the new energy resources of the 
21st century from the perspective of strategic transitions, and 
must start early in making the corresponding policy decisions 
and deployments. For this reason, we have asked some experts and 
scholars to conduct a discussion. We are now publishing the main 
points of representative speeches given at the symposium to 
attract the attention of readers in all areas. 
<H3>  I. The Status of Developing New Energy Resources in Our 
Overall National Economic Situation </H3>
  I bring up this issue because very few people have mentioned 
new energy resources in the process of accelerating the 
development of China's national economy. On the one hand, people 
not in the energy resource trenches do not understand new energy 
resources very well, while on the other hand people in these 
trenches feel that new energy resources do not require the 
solution of major problems. A failure to resolve this problem of 
understanding may cause China's new energy resource industry to 
miss the favorable opportunity of the present time, slow our 
progress in developing new energy resources, and thereby affect 
China's future energy resource strategy of the 21st century. 
Therefore, it is necessary that I summarize here the important 
status and role of new energy resources in the development of 
our national economy, concepts that the Chinese people do not 
understand clearly and that people have not yet accepted. 
  New energy resources is the general name used 
internationally 
for solar power, wind energy, marine energy, geothermal energy, 
biomass energy, and fuel cells. Because solar power, wind 
energy, marine energy, geothermal energy, and biomass energy are 
characterized by being renewable, they are called renewable 
energy resources. At present, new energy resources are energy 
resources that mankind utilizes in a transition to a new state 
and they have been receiving growing attention since the 
petroleum crisis of the 1970s. The technology for their 
application has been developing quickly and they are moving 
toward greater maturity and the achievement of commercialization 
so that new energy resources are forming forces of production in 
energy resource systems and occupying a first-class status in 
the energy resource structure. For the past several years, many 
authorities in energy resources and economics have explained in 
scientific, technical, economic, and political terms that while 
the 20th century was the petroleum and hydrocarbon era, major 
changes will occur during the 21st century. Because of the 
effects of scientific and technological developments and 
breakthroughs, restrictions by the global environment, the need 
for sustained social development, economic and political 
factors, and so on, mankind is now starting to enter the era of 
renewable energy resources. At present, the total amount of 
energy resources consumed each year globally is only equivalent 
to the amount of energy irradiated onto the earth's surface from 
the sun in 40 minutes, which means that solar energy is 13,000 
times the amount of energy consumed in the world. Solar power is 
energy that causes absolutely no pollution, and all renewable 
energy resources including solar energy, wind power, water 
energy, biomass energy, and so on come from solar energy. In the 
next century, as we face the dual crises of conventional fuels 
becoming exhausted and the environmental pollution they cause, 
new energy resources will develop further. Thus, energy and 
economic experts and authorities with long-term views are 
calling for the entire world to take action in a major effort to 
develop and utilize new energy resources. 
  China is a big producer and consumer of energy resources and 
coal dominates our energy resource utilization, accounting for 
about 75 percent of primary energy resources. Within the 
foreseeable future, coal will continue to be China's main energy 
resource. China's coal output may reach 1.4 billion tons in 
2000. As our economy quickly grows, China's energy resource 
structure in which coal is the primary factor will face two big 
problems. One is the extremely uneven geographic distribution of 
our coal resources and the ever-growing pressure on 
transportation. Some 79.8 percent of China's currently proven 
coal reserves are concentrated in north and northwest China and 
most other regions rely mainly on railway transportation for the 
coal they use. A substantial portion of China's railway 
transportation capacity is used to haul coal, which has resulted 
in long-term shortages of railway transportation capacity that 
have been hard to change. The second problem is the increasingly 
serious atmospheric pollution and ecological destruction that 
results from burning large amounts of coal, which has attracted 
attention in China and foreign countries. China now generates 
about 15 million tons of carbon dioxide annually and is one of 
the largest sources of CO[.sup]2[/] in the world. Moreover, 
because of the effects, geographic restrictions, decentralized 
and fluctuating loads, the economy, and other factors, China 
still has several regions that will face difficulties in 
ensuring supplies of conventional energy resources for a 
relatively long period. These problems will vex China's energy 
resource industry and even development of our national economy 
for a period into the future. How can we resolve them? In the 
long term, one feasible method is to formulate and implement a 
development strategy for the diversification of our energy 
resource structure in a major effort to develop new energy 
resources (renewable energy resources). 
  In reality, China's energy resources are characterized by a 
diverse resource structure. Besides having extremely abundant 
coal, petroleum, and natural gas mineral energy resources, we 
are also very well endowed with renewable energy resources. 
Moreover, our renewable energy resources and mineral energy 
resources are also generally characterized by being mutually 
supplementary in the geographic distribution of all types of 
energy resources. During the past 10-plus years, under guidance 
by the overall policy of "adapting to local conditions, 
supplementation by a variety of energy resources, comprehensive 
utilization, and a concern for real results," new energy 
resource applications technology has moved from the scientific 
research stage to the application stage and some new energy 
resource technologies are capable of competing locally with 
mineral fuel applications technology. This is especially true of 
the role they have played in spurring economic development and 
social stability in the basic energy resource requirements of 
peasants and pastoralists in frontier, pastoral, and island 
regions. Practice has proven that new energy resources are 
energy resources with "long-term prospects and short-term 
benefits." Actively and rationally developing new energy 
resources is not something that we can take or leave in the 
development of our national economy. Instead, it is directly 
related to the development of China's energy resources and 
environmental improvement, and thereby affects the development 
of our entire national economy. Development and utilization of 
new energy resources is an objective necessity to meet this type 
of need. Still, in the current period of energy resource 
departments competing to "take the plunge" [into business 
activities] and move toward the market, if they are only 
concerned with short-term benefits and only take into account 
present-day requirements by neglecting construction and 
development of new energy resources and demote new energy 
resources by only treating them as small-scale energy resources, 
they will certainly miss an historical opportunity for rapid 
development of new energy resources and endanger the new trend 
of a major transition, major transformation, and major 
competition of China's new energy resources competing against 
the world's energy resources, and their status in the new 
configuration, which will in turn endanger China's future 
comprehensive strengths and development potential and reserve 
strengths. 
<H5>  II. Issues and Ideas in the New Energy Resource Field </H5>
<H5>  A. The Maturity of New Energy Resource Technical Economics </H5>
  The development of new energy resource applications 
technology poses challenges for traditional electric power 
supply concepts. Because of scientific and technical progress, 
changes in the energy resource structure, and the need to 
protect the environment, conserve energy resources, and improve 
energy resource efficiency, the traditional centralized and 
unified power supply arrangement of large grids and large 
generators will be challenged by applications of new energy 
resource technologies and by decentralized and locally balanced 
small-scale power generation equipment and energy storage 
facilities. For over 100 years, the traditional arrangement of 
large grids, large generators, and centralized power supplies 
has always been considered to be the safest and most economical 
power supply arrangement. However, because construction and 
development of large grids and large generators are restricted 
by a variety of conditions and because of the great difficulty 
in guaranteeing the safety and reliability of power supplies, 
decentralized power supply arrangements (called distributed 
utility in the United States) are continuing to display their 
superiority and vitality. Under the guidance of this idea, new 
energy resource development and application technology has moved 
toward commercialization and now attained applied levels that 
enable them to operate in connection with large power grids 
while also being capable of independently supplying electricity 
in a decentralized manner. As for the development and 
application of new energy resources themselves, international 
and domestic practice has proven that the technical economic 
prospects of new energy resources are determined by their 
ability to compete with conventional energy resources. The focus 
of competition is on power generation technology for new energy 
resources to convert new energy resources into an economically 
competitive high-grade secondary energy resource--electricity. 
Internationally, new energy resource circles in the 1960s, at 
the time when power was generated from new energy resources, 
only proposed small-scale equipment measured in watts. In the 
1970s, the discussion was of equipment of several kilowatts. 
This rose in the 1980s to several tens of kilowatts. As the 
1990s began, however, people were operating applied systems of 
the MW grade. One can see that the speed of new energy resource 
development has far surpassed people's imaginations. The costs 
of most new energy resource applications projects have declined 
over the years, and the construction costs for solar thermal 
energy power stations, photovoltaic power stations, wind-powered 
generating fields, and geothermal power stations have now 
declined to $1,000 to $1,500 per kW and power generation costs 
to $0.07 to $0.08 per kWh. Projections are that the power 
generation costs using new energy resources will drop to about 
$0.04 per kWh by the year 2000. 
  Regarding power generation technology, new energy resource 
power generation technology has just gotten off the ground in 
China and the problems we must resolve include: the need to 
improve the quality of miniature wind-powered generators and the 
need to raise standardization and systemization levels and 
further reduce costs; the need to import and absorb technology 
from foreign countries for the design and manufacture of 
medium-sized and large generators that can be connected to grids 
to form a substantial batch production capacity on a domestic 
foundation and to establish several large and medium-sized wind 
energy power generation fields that display technical benefits 
functions; and improvements related to the substantial lag of 
China's present photovoltaic batteries behind foreign countries 
in quality and efficiency. In addition, we must diversify and 
apply the associated matching applied technology; we must 
centralize specialized staffs and regularize starting points for 
solar thermal energy power generation; geothermal power 
generator urgently requires the development of high-temperature 
mine survey technology and scientific research on refilling and 
heat storage technology; the manufacturing technology for the 
tidal energy full through-flow water turbine generators that we 
have already successfully developed requires improvement; the 
development of biomass energy resources must develop toward high 
grades and thereby toward power generation, solidification, 
carbonization, and gasification technology. China's new energy 
resource development technology faces many important issues and 
has many objectives. We must gradually increase investments to 
solve problems in scientific and engineering applications. 
  In economic terms, new energy resource power generation 
technology is a new force of production in the electric power 
industry and its application is still in the initial stages. The 
economic problems it faces are: in the state's present economic 
structure and price system, the benefits from new energy 
resources in the short term will still mainly be social benefits 
and environmental and ecological benefits, and their economic 
benefits will not be that significant; in China, the capital now 
used for development and utilization of new energy resources 
holds no status to speak of in the overall investments in energy 
resources and it is very difficult to undertake more intensive 
comprehensive and systematic research. Because of seriously 
inadequate expenditures and too-small project scales, it is very 
hard for demonstration and applications engineering projects to 
achieve their objective of displaying technical economic 
benefits and guiding market development prospects. 
<H3>  B. The Impact of Reforms of the Energy Resource System on 
New Energy Resource Development </H3>
  For a long time to come, energy resources will still be the 
key restricting factor for China's national economic and social 
development as well as the focus for reversing ecological and 
environmental degradation. However, in a worldwide comparison, 
our acknowledgement and understanding of the role and status of 
new energy resources is still very poor. Under the heavy 
pressures of serious stagnation in system reform in energy 
resource departments, accelerated economic development, and 
serious shortages of energy resources, it is even harder for 
them to receive the attention that they should. In the process 
of shifting tracks from the traditional planned economy, new 
energy resources are facing a two-sided pincer attack from the 
traditional planned economy and the market on development of the 
new energy resource industry. The traditional planned economy 
has occupied the primary status in energy resource departments 
for a long time and the production, allocation, and utilization 
of energy resources are managed too much and too closely, with 
low efficiency, a serious detachment of prices and the trade 
system from the actual market, departmental segmentation, 
friction from regulations, and regional closures that impede 
market development as well as macro coordination. In this type 
of situation, it is hard to make quick readjustments in 
programs, investments, prices, and taxation to extend new energy 
resource applications technology and provide preferential 
measures. Furthermore, under conditions of incomplete market 
operational mechanisms, the unfavorable circumstances for the 
newly-born new energy resources industry are obvious. 
<H3>  C. The Impact of Energy Resource Development Strategies on 
New Energy Resources </H3>
  China has a relative insufficiency of energy resources with 
per capita energy resource reserves that are just one-half the 
world average. Moreover, nearly all are in a unitary energy 
resource structure in which coal is the dominant factor. Because 
of long-term low-price plundering exploitation and extensive 
consumption, the overall efficiency of the energy resource 
system is extremely low, so we must use comprehensive reform of 
the economic system to truly change the extensive development 
model of relying on the squandering of precious energy resources 
to support low results economic growth. This means that we must 
place improvement of the ultimate efficiency of energy resources 
in the primary position and truly and comprehensively implement 
a major energy conservation principle. 
  While we are comprehensively implementing major energy 
conservation measures and increasing energy supplies, we must 
have a broad and long-term view, look toward the future, and 
make major efforts to readjust the energy resource structure, 
accelerate the pace of new energy resource development, reduce 
the extraction of fossil fuels, raise the strategic status of 
new energy resources, and strive to make new energy resources 
account for a significant proportion of China's energy resource 
structure by the year 2000. Moreover, we must lay a solid 
foundation for accelerated development of commercial 
applications of new energy resource S&amp;T in the next century 
and 
thereby resolve the limitations of fossil fuels and foster the 
renewability of new energy resources. Increase the production of 
new energy resources to reduce discharges and pollution from 
CO[.sup]2[/], SO[.sub]2[/], NO[.sub]x[/], and dust from 
conventional fossil fuels and lessen the threat of acid rain and 
its negative impact on nearby countries and the global 
environment. This will also greatly benefit China's reduction of 
investments in technical upgrading to prevent pollution from 
conventional energy resources and improve overall investment 
results. 
  We must adopt the energy resource strategies and principles 
outlined above to be able to formulate energy resource 
development plans that conform to our national conditions and 
that are capable of long-term strategic action and thereby 
achieve sustained and coordinated development of China's 
population, energy resources, environment, and economy. 
Otherwise, an energy resource structure that fundamentally 
relies on coal will ultimately pull us into a disastrous 
situation. 
<H5>  D. The Goal Model for Reform </H5>
  It is precisely due to all types of profound ideas that new 
energy resource circles worldwide have proposed the slogan of 
"think globally, act locally." The member nations of the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) are setting aside 7 percent of 
their financial budgets for use in new energy resource R&amp;D 
and 
authorities are calling for all nations to place the work of 
developing and utilizing new energy resources in the primary 
position to adapt to the needs of the energy resource system of 
the 21st century. As a developing nation, China is a country 
with a large demand for energy resources as well as a major 
energy resource polluter, so during the process of economic 
reform and development we must formulate clear strategies and 
countermeasures concerning the question of new energy resources, 
and we must formulate the corresponding goal models for 
readjustment, transformation, and transition in our energy 
resource structure to be able to catch up with the enormous 
changes that will occur worldwide. 
  1. During the period of moving from a planned economy toward 
a market economy system, development of new energy resources 
must adhere to the principle of linking planning with the market 
and the development of new energy resources must mainly involve 
their conversion into electricity so that new energy resources 
become direct forces of production factors to meet market 
demand. Initially commercialized new energy resource technology 
can only foster its advantages of integrating planning with the 
market and make use of a relaxed policy environment to be able 
to seize the opportunity for new energy resources, accelerate 
their development, and create the conditions for China's new 
energy resources to enter self-reliant and market-oriented 
benevolent development in the 21st century. 
  2. In the long term, the new energy resource industry is a 
new force of production in that industry, and the new energy 
resource industry must boldly enter the market to develop itself 
and take a new route for the development of China's energy 
resource industry, through actively utilizing the market economy 
system such as raising capital through a variety of channels, 
implementing a shareholding system and shareholding cooperation 
system, and adopting an arrangement of joint administration for 
mutual benefit in management. As for the government's 
macro-management, it should create a benevolent environment for 
the development of new energy resources, adopt internationally 
accepted methods, and provide all types of policy supports for 
new energy resource investments, such as tax reductions and 
exemptions, preferential prices, and so on to propel new energy 
resources into the market, rely on themselves to develop and 
exist and grow, and thereby spur the comprehensive movement of 
China's new energy resources onto the track of international 
levels in terms of science and technology, development and 
management, economic benefits, and other areas. 
<H3>  E. Raising Our National Consciousness Regarding New Energy 
Resources </H3>
  It is now extremely evident that the development and 
utilization of new energy resources is an historical milestone 
in mankind's social development and scientific progress and that 
a consciousness regarding improvement of our entire nation's 
development and utilization of new energy resources has now 
become an extremely important epochal task. We must with impetus 
and attraction conduct regular and broad-ranging propaganda. We 
must make people at all levels as well as the masses understand 
the significance and role of new energy resources in terms of 
the fundamental status of energy resources and their impact and 
role on the economy and environment so that we spur the 
formulation of a state new energy resource development law and 
use legislation to guarantee the sustained development of new 
energy resources, transform the current management state of 
bullishness and lack of procedures regarding new energy 
resources and, with an overall program and goal model, rely on a 
multi-directional and multiple level market while also relying 
on policies to support the development of new energy resources. 
This is essential if China in the 21st century is to be able to 
participate in global joint development on a foundation of 
comprehensive and healthy development of S&amp;T, society, and 
the 
economy.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from article by Wang Sicheng [3769 2448 2052], </F>
senior engineer in the Ministry of Machine-Building and 
Electronics Industry's Sixth Institute, Beijing: "The Current 
State of Photovoltaic Power Generation and China's Lag"] 
  [Excerpts] Photovoltaic [PV] power generation is an 
important branch of new energy resources. PV power generation 
systems are safe and reliable, noiseless, and non-polluting, do 
not require the consumption of fuels, do not require the 
construction of high-voltage power transmission lines, have 
short construction schedules, and can assume any scale. Because 
PV power generation system have no mechanical or moving parts, 
they have extremely low breakdown rates and are simple to 
maintain. Furthermore, PV power generation is subject to only 
minimal restrictions by regional resources and is far better 
than other renewable energy resources (such as hydropower, wind 
power, geothermal, marine energy, etc.) because light resources 
are evenly distributed across the globe. It is precisely because 
of this that PV power generation has attracted the universal 
attention of all countries and developed very quickly. World 
output of solar cells was just 2.5MW in 1980 but had grown to 
60MW by 1992. 
  [passage omitted] 
  Applications of PV power generation in China began in the 
1970s but they did not actually develop until after 1982. During 
a period of just a few years from 1983 to 1987 we imported seven 
solar cell production lines from the United States, Canada, and 
other countries, causing China's solar cell production capacity 
to leap from 200 kW before 1984 to 4.5MW in 1988. Because of 
financial restrictions, however, it was very hard to open a 
market and the rate of construction starts for solar cell 
production during the past several years has been extremely 
inadequate, only about one-tenth of our production capabilities 
(see Table 2).

and the total

  In terms of research levels, while laboratory levels for 
high-efficiency cells, chemical compound cells, and 
non-crystalline silicon cells do not lag very far behind foreign 
countries, we do lag very far behind them in the area of 
converting them into forces of production. In certain new types 
of solar cells such as spherical cells, MIS cells, 
polycrystalline membrane cells, and other areas, the domestic 
situation is almost a blank. 
  In the area of applications, solar cells in China at the 
present time are mainly used in communications systems and 
frontier regions. Many applications realms such as photovoltaic 
water pumps, civilian appliances, and so on have yet to be 
opened up. For the long-term market, however, such as PV power 
generation grid connection systems, battery-powered automobile 
charging systems, seawater desalination systems, and so on, 
development and demonstrations have still not been included on 
the agenda. 
  In summary, China's research, development, production, 
applications, and other areas concerning PV power generation lag 
substantially behind the developed countries and many problems 
also exist. 
  PV power generation involves systems engineering and touches 
upon a variety of industrial realms. Silicon, the raw material 
for solar cells, falls under the metallurgical industry. Sealing 
materials such as low iron and steel chemical glass, EVA, 
silver, aluminum slurry, and so on fall under the chemical 
industry. The matching storage batteries fall under the battery 
industry. The retransformers used in PV power stations and PV 
water pumps fall under the electric power and electronics 
industry. Power station control systems, special purpose 
instruments and equipment, and design software fall under the 
electronics and computer industries. High efficiency 
energy-saving loads, such as lamps, refrigerators, and 
televisions, fall under civilian appliances. Thus, truly 
high-quality inexpensive PV products are determined by overall 
national industrial foundations and levels. To develop China's 
PV power generation industry, we must emphasize the following 
points: 
  1. The emergence of China's PV power generation industry is 
not the result of market demand but was instead the result of 
imports. At present, all producing plants are in difficult 
straits and hope that the state will be able to provide 
substantial inputs to spur technical progress in this industry 
and encourage scientific research departments to vow to solve 
the production problems that now exist in plants such as a shift 
to domestic production of raw materials and auxiliary materials, 
raising finished production rates, improving the conversion 
efficiency of solar cells, and so on to ultimately attain the 
goals of reducing costs and improving quality to spur the course 
of industrialization of the PV power generation industry. 
  2. We must pay attention to the establishment of development 
and experimental base areas for PV power generation systems that 
combine technology development and production development, and 
that take responsibility for engineering and personnel training, 
engineering experiments, and production quality inspection and 
control to guarantee the quality of PV products and consolidate 
the existing market. 
  3. Make major efforts to open up markets and establish 
demonstration projects in potential applications realms in the 
market such as PV water pumps, seawater desalination stations, 
power grid terminus grid connection systems, and so on. Use the 
demonstrations to derive technological breakthroughs and design 
and operating experience and lay a foundation for future scale 
applications of PV power generation.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from article by Lu Weide [7120 4850 1795], </F>
researcher in the Solar Energy Institute, Beijing: "The Current 
Situation of Solar Energy Heat Utilization and China's 
Countermeasures"] 
  [Excerpts] Solar energy is an enormous energy resource that 
does not pollute the environment. The modes of solar energy 
conversion and utilization are: photo-electrical conversion, 
photo-thermal conversion, and photo-chemical conversion. Solar 
energy heat utilization technologies can be divided overall 
according to the temperature range of their ultimate use into 
low-temperature, moderate-temperature, and high-temperature. 
Low-temperature (under 100C): hot water for household uses, 
heating, drying, distillation, agricultural greenhouses, etc.; 
Moderate-temperature (100 to 300C): industrial heat, 
cooling and air conditioning, cooking, etc.; High-temperature 
(above 300C): thermal power generation, high-temperature 
materials processing, sterilization processing of toxic 
materials, etc. 
  Among solar energy heat utilization technologies, solar 
energy water heating and structural solar energy heating 
technologies are now mature and have attained the applications 
stage. The energy consumption in these two categories of 
ultimate utilization now account for a significant proportion of 
total energy consumption, about 37 percent in the United States. 
There have also been technical breakthroughs in solar energy 
thermal power generation which is consequently developing very 
quickly. This article focuses on the current situation and 
development strategies for solar energy hot water, heating, 
thermal power generation, and other primary heat utilization 
realms.

China's Solar Energy Heat Utilization Technology </H3>
<H5>  A. The Distribution of China's Solar Energy Resources </H5>
  China is located in the eastern part of the Eurasian 
continent in the northern hemisphere, and it has a vast 
territory and abundant solar energy resources. The total annual 
amount of solar irradiation in the various regions of China 
ranges from 3.3 x 10[.sup]6[/] to 8.4 x 10[.sup]6[/] 
kilocalories/square meter, with an average of 5.9 x 
10[.sup]6[/] kilocalories/square meter. See Table 1 for a 
detailed distribution of China's solar energy resources. In the 
table, categories I, II, and III regions are regions with 
relatively abundant solar energy resources and they cover an 
area equal to more than two-thirds of China's total area.

<H3>  B. China's Advances in Solar Energy Heat Utilization 
Technology </H3>
  China's research and demonstration of solar energy heat 
utilization in an organized and guided manner began in the 
mid-1970s. Starting in the 1980s, new energy resource and 
renewable energy resource technology was included in the state's 
attack on key S&amp;T problems in the Sixth 5-Year Plan, Seventh 
5-Year Plan, and Eighth 5-Year Plan, and solar energy heat 
utilization technology is a subtopic in new energy resource and 
renewable energy resource projects. 
  Starting from China's national strengths and real needs, the 
focus of attacks on key S&amp;T problems regarding solar energy 
heat 
utilization in the Sixth 5-Year Plan and Seventh 5-Year Plan was 
placed on preferential development of low-temperature heat 
utilization technology. The actual projects were: solar energy 
water heaters, passive solar energy-saving houses, solar energy 
dryers, and solar stoves. Through 10 years of efforts, solar 
energy heat utilization technology in these four realms 
basically moved forward, S&amp;T achievements have shifted into 
small batch production to varying degrees and a substantial 
number have an extension and application coverage area and have 
provided real benefits in alleviating local shortages of 
conventional energy resources, reducing ecological and 
environmental degradation, and other areas. According to 
incomplete statistics for 1991, we have extended 1.8 million 
square meters of solar energy water heaters, 300,000 square 
meters (structural area) of passive solar energy-saving houses, 
330,000 hectares of solar energy agricultural greenhouses, 
120,000 solar stoves, and 1,314 square meters of solar energy 
dryers, and we have consistently maintained a development 
momentum. Chinese-made solar energy water heaters can conserve 
an average of 100 to 150 kg of standard coal per square meter 
each year. Solar stoves can conserve 500 to 700 kg of firewood 
per unit each year. 
<H5>  C. The Main Problems and Impediments That Exist at Present </H5>
  China lags behind foreign countries in two areas in solar 
energy heat utilization. One is S&amp;T investments. The 
government 
in the United States invested $500 million annually in solar 
energy research and development from the late 1970s to early 
1980s. Subsequently, due to a drop in the price of petroleum and 
the energy policies of the Reagan government, there was a 
substantial reduction in expenditures on solar energy research 
and by the early 1990s they were consistently maintained at the 
level of $150 to $200 million annually. Japan's New Energy 
Resource Industrial Technology Comprehensive Development 
Organization (NEDO) and Global Environmental Industrial 
Technology Research Organization (RITE) organized scientific 
research units and large enterprises to establish an R&amp;D 
group 
to help accelerate the course of R&amp;D and commercialization. 
Thus, the development of solar energy heat utilization in the 
developed countries at the present time is characterized by 
high-S&amp;T injections, especially for breakthroughs in new 
materials R&amp;D such as light condensors and vacuum tube heat 
collectors used in solar energy thermal power generation 
stations or tower-type solar energy boilers, which are the 
result of the commercialization of major achievements in modern 
materials science and heat transfer science. The second area is 
policies to encourage the extension and development of solar 
energy. Since the 1990s, the developed countries have 
universally focused on global environmental issues and raised 
the development and utilization of new energy resources to 
reduce CO[.sup]2[/] discharges to an important strategic 
height, and they have concrete measures and policies to provide 
economic subsidies or tax reductions and exemptions to new 
energy resources. Thirty-one of the states in the United States 
have implemented energy conservation Energy Resource Ultimate 
Utilization Management (Demand-Side Management) plans (as part 
of comprehensive resource plans). Their method involves state 
governments encouraging public utility (electric power, natural 
gas, and coal gas) companies to make every possible effort to 
generate less electricity and supply less gas with a 
precondition of satisfying user load demand. In this manner, 
companies transfer their investments in power plant capacity 
expansion to energy conservation upgrading on the user end, 
which has the advantages of smaller investments, short capital 
turnover cycles, and little risk. Now, solar energy hot water 
supplies and solar energy heating are to be included in 
construction end management plans, which has solved problems 
with the impediments of large initial investments for solar 
energy equipment and excessively heavy user burdens. It is 
expected that, spurred by this new plan, solar energy water 
heaters and solar energy-saving houses will become more 
widespread and develop more quickly. 
<H5>  III. Development Strategies and Countermeasures </H5>
<H5>  A. Technology Development Objectives for Different Periods </H5>
  China is a developing country and 800 million of its 
population lives in vast rural regions. The energy consumed 
annually to sustain the minimum normal household energy needs of 
our peasants accounts for 30 percent of China's total energy 
consumption. Within a rather long period to come, China's 
commodity energy resource supplies will be unable to completely 
satisfy the basic energy requirements of production and life in 
rural areas. For this reason, in the near term (the next 20 
years), the development and utilization of solar energy heat 
utilization technology in China should still mainly involve 
low-temperature heat utilization and be oriented toward rural 
areas and medium-sized and small cities to alleviate the 
shortages of energy resources there for living and production 
energy needs (heating, hot water, solar energy greenhouses, 
etc.) and improve the situation of ecological and environmental 
degradation that has arisen there because of energy shortages. 
In the medium and long term (20 to 50 years from now), by 
serving as a program to replace part of the coal we burn, we 
could develop solar energy thermal power generation as 
appropriate and extend energy-saving type structures centered on 
solar energy heat utilization in cities. 
<H5>  B. Strategic Choices for Different Regions </H5>
  1. In regions with category I solar irradiation resources, 
we 
can give consideration in medium and long-term plans to the 
construction of solar energy thermal power stations, especially 
in Tibet, which is very poor in coal, oil, and other 
conventional energy resources and which has abundant direct 
radiation sunlight sources, making it uniquely superior 
economically for the development of solar energy thermal power 
generation. Prior to 2000, we should try to set up trial point 
demonstrations to enable further evaluations after comparison 
with photovoltaic power generation stations. 
  2. In regions with categories I, II, and III solar 
irradiation resources, we should further extend passive solar 
energy-saving houses and solar energy water heaters (as a part 
of structural facilities). 
  3. In certain poor regions (mainly in northwest China), 
there 
are still places where solar stoves can be used, but we must pay 
attention to quality improvements and implement industrialized 
production. 
<H5>  C. Suggested Countermeasures and Measures </H5>
  1. Based on the 10 countermeasures and measures that we 
should adopt in China's environmental and development programs 
proposed by the government, move further in formulating programs 
for the development of new energy resources and renewable energy 
resources, and provide policies focused on providing support in 
raising capital, preferential treatment in tax collection, and 
other areas. 
  2. For major solar energy thermal utilization projects such 
as solar energy power generation stations, which have already 
been commercialized internationally, China should base itself on 
importing advanced technology and equipment from foreign 
countries. In regions with abundant sunlight such as Tibet, use 
feasibility research as a basis for government investment to 
invest in their construction. Avoid the waste caused by small 
investments and repeated low-level scientific research. 
  3. The government should use industrial conferences and 
other 
means to organize and reinforce industrial management for solar 
energy water heater and solar stove products. They should mainly 
do good work on standardization and quality demonstration 
systems to guarantee product quality. 
  4. Solar energy energy-saving structures occupy an important 
status in structural energy conservation and the Ministry of 
Construction should provide unified deployments and programs. 
  5. Focus on absorbing foreign capital to develop the solar 
energy product market and raise the quality of China's solar 
energy water heaters to modern international levels and make 
them competitive in the international market.

China Energy Resource Research Society New Energy Resources 
Special Committee, Beijing: "China's Abundant Marine Energy 
Awaits Development"] 
  [Text] China's continental coastline is over 18,000 
kilometers long, and we have over 6,500 large and small islands 
with coastlines about 14,000 kilometers long and a marine area 
covering over 4.7 million square kilometers. China is a country 
rich in marine energy resources. Based on current technical 
levels, China has about 400,000 to 500,000MW of renewable marine 
energy including 100,000MW of tidal energy, 70,000MW of wave 
energy, 30,000MW of marine current energy, 150,000MW of seawater 
temperature differential energy, and 110,000MW of salinity 
differential energy. Currently, with the exception of a few 
small tidal power stations and miniature wave power generators, 
the utilization of China's marine energy is basically nil. 
  In the present situation of energy resource shortages and 
continual development of new technologies, many countries are 
extremely concerned with developing marine energy. In the long 
term, mankind will march toward the seas and will inevitably 
make full use of marine energy. For tidal power generation 
alone, France completed the 240MW La Rance Tidal Power Station 
in 1967; its operational condition so far has been excellent. 
Subsequently, the former Soviet Union completed the (Jisiluo) 
Tidal Power Station with an installed generating capacity of 2MW 
and Canada completed the Annapolis Preliminary Tidal Power 
Station with a single unit capacity of 20MW in 1983 to develop 
large-scale tidal power generation for the 4,000MW of power in 
the Bay of Fundy. England, India, Korea, and other countries 
also plan to build large-scale tidal power stations. The United 
States, Japan, France, and others are now speeding up research 
on marine temperature differential power generation and are now 
conducting MW-grade power station experiments. Norway and 
Denmark, as well as England and Japan, which are renowned for 
marine research, have also established several wave power 
generation devices of varying sizes. 
  China has built seven small tidal power stations along its 
southeastern coast with a total installed generating capacity of 
8.3MW. They include the Jiangxia Tidal Power Station in 
Zhejiang's Wenling County, the most representative, which now 
has five generators with a total capacity of 3.2MW having an 
operational arrangement utilizing bidirectional power generation 
for rising and falling tides using bulb-type generators. Their 
operating situation has been excellent since they were placed 
into operation in 1980. Besides generating electricity, this 
power station has also facilitated communication on both sides 
of the bay, enclosed over 5,000 mu of farmland and orchards for 
reclamation, and developed the reservoir breeding industry, so 
the overall economic benefits have been significant. For this 
reason, after a Korean delegation visited Jiangxi Tidal Power 
Station in 1991, they immediately decided to study China's 
experiences in developing tidal power stations, and in 1992, 
following several civilian technology exchanges between the two 
countries, the Koreans finally requested that their government 
approve the long-planned (Jialulin) Bay Tidal Power Station 
(400MW) program be turned over to a group of Chinese experts for 
a feasibility discussion, and they plan to utilize Chinese 
technology and equipment. This is the world's biggest tidal 
power station to date. 
  The situation outlined above shows that China has a rather 
good hydropower technology foundation and tidal power station 
practice and experience and that accelerated development of 
tidal power generation, especially in the economically developed 
coastal areas that have relative power shortages, is essential. 
Through integration with the state's improvement of our national 
territory and preferential development of coastal islands, 
resettlement to develop barren islands with no permanent 
resident population must first of all provide them with supplies 
of energy resources and fresh water. If we can rationally 
utilize all types of marine energy and renewable solar energy, 
wind energy, and biomass energy, adapt to local conditions, and 
persevere, this will benefit our nation and our people.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from article by Ren Xiang [0117 3276], chairman of </F>
the China Energy Resource Research Society Geothermal Special 
Committee and professor, Beijing: "Development and Utilization 
of Geothermal Energy Resources"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
  China began dealing with geothermal resources in systematic 
energy resource assessments and development and utilization in 
the early 1970s. Through more than 20 years of efforts, we now 
have a rather deep understanding of the characteristics and 
distributional laws of China's geothermal resources. Based on 
geodesic and magmatic movement characteristics, China can be 
divided into four geothermal zones: a moderate and 
low-temperature geothermal zone along the southeast coast that 
is primarily of a convection type; a high and 
moderate-temperature geothermal zone in southwest China that is 
a convection type; a moderate and low-temperature geothermal 
region in north, northeast, and northwest China that is a 
sedimentary basin conductive type; and the high-temperature 
geothermal region of Taiwan. Their distributions are closely 
related to active tectonism in the crust. 
  China's geothermal springs are found throughout the country 
and hot springs have now been discovered at over 3,000 sites. We 
have completed the drilling of over 2,000 geothermal wells and 
done surveys and evaluations of 300 geothermal points (through 
early 1993). Among the surveyed geothermal fields, there are two 
high-temperature (over 150C) ones at Yangbajing and Yangyi 
in Tibet and we have discovered hot fluids above 200C. 
There are nine moderate-temperature (90 to 150C) sites, 80 
low-temperature sites (60 to 90C), and 209 sites below 
60C. Prior to the Eighth 5-Year Plan, with the exception of 
a few high-temperature geothermal fields, the primary survey 
regions were in the densely populated and economically developed 
east and north China regions. The available thermal energy 
proven through the surveys is: 41.72MW of grade A, equal to 1.5 
percent, 982.55MW of grade B, equal to 35.4 percent, 648.93MW of 
grade C, equal to 23.4 percent, and 1,102.97MW of grade D, equal 
to 39.7 percent. Very few high-grade reserves have had a high 
degree of research. 
  According to incomplete statistics, the total amount of 
natural heat released annually by China's geothermal springs and 
wells (artesian wells) is 1.04 x 10[.sup]14[/] kilocalories 
annually, which is equivalent to 3,559,500 tons of standard 
coal. The total amount of proven geothermal resources is 925.72 
x 10[.sup]14[/] kilocalories per year, which is equivalent to 
3.158 billion tons of standard coal. The long-term prospective 
geothermal resources are 39,649.7 x 10[.sup]14[/] 
kilocalories, which is equivalent to 135.3 billion tons of 
standard coal. Moreover, the hundreds of fault-subsidence basins 
found throughout China contain abundant conductive-type moderate 
and low-temperature geothermal resources. In our 10 large 
basins, the exploitable resources at depths of less than 2,000 
meters would be 5.4853 x 10[.sup]18[/] kilocalories annually, 
which is equivalent to 187.16 billion tons of standard coal 
(Table 5). The total exploitable reserves are 49.18 x 
10[.sup]18[/] kilocalories annually, equivalent to 337.331 
billion tons of standard coal. This is based on the reserves 
that would be extractable under present technical economic 
conditions (Zheng Zhuohua [6774 3504 5478] et al., 1992). In 
addition, there are a calculated 27.13 x 10[.sup]18[/] 
kilocalories that are temporarily difficult to utilize, 
equivalent to 185.15 billion tons of standard coal. Furthermore, 
geothermal wells have been drilled in 148 cities including 
Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Fuzhou, Kunming, Jinan, and others 
which have provided the conditions for urban utilization. 
  Since being treated as energy resources in the 1970s, 
geothermal utilization has developed very quickly, increasing by 
7 to 12 percent annually. To date, we have completed several 
small-scale geothermal experimental power stations (Table 1). 
While we have moved forward in moderate and low-temperature 
power generation technology, most of them have shut down due to 
costs being too high, leaving only the two sites at Huitang in 
Hunan and Fengshun in Guangdong which use 92C water as an 
intermediate medium and are operating intermittently. The 
Yangbajing Geothermal Power Station, the only one with water 
temperatures from 150 to 172C and well mouth pressures of 3 
atmospheres, has grown since starting a 1MW experiment to 25.1MW 
(1992) and has now become Lhasa's primary power station, 
accounting for 40 percent of its power supplies (Table 2). 
Presently, China's total geothermal installed generating 
capacity is just 28.6MW. China has now proven over 170 sites 
with high-temperature geothermal systems (heat reserves 
&gt; 150C) distributed in southern Tibet, western Yunnan, 
western Sichuan, and Taiwan with a power generation potential of 
7,000MW. This shows that progress in China's geothermal power 
generation industry has been slow.

  Direct utilization of widely-distributed moderate and 
low-temperature geothermal resources has grown at an average 
rate of 12 percent and we have now leaped to second place in the 
world in its development. The utilization realm is extremely 
broad, ranging over 20 items including industrial processing, 
drying, icemaking, cropping, breeding, balneotherapy, tourism, 
earthquake prediction, extraction of useful components, and so 
on at 1,101 sites with a yearly heat output of 89,485.96 x 
10[.sup]12[/] kilocalories, equivalent to 3.02 million tons 
of standard coal. 
  China's geothermal power generation and direct utilization 
up 
to the end of 1990 had a total replacement capacity equivalent 
to 3.47 million tons of standard coal (equal to 0.34 percent of 
China's total primary energy resource consumption). 
  We have spent a total of 250 billion yuan over the past 20 
years on evaluating China's geothermal resources and an 
additional 10 million yuan in research expenditures, and over 10 
provincial, municipal, and autonomous region mining bureaus have 
specialized geothermal survey staffs. By the first half of 1991, 
they had drilled 1,767 geothermal wells (not including over 700 
wells drilled by petroleum and other departments) for a total 
drilling footage of 589,000 meters. We established the China 
Energy Resource Research Society Geothermal Specialized 
Committee Academic Group that includes 644 members from 28 
provinces and municipalities and over 40 specializations. China 
also has 14 geothermal research institutes (offices) and over 
100 development and utilization enterprises. In summary, China 
has the capability of assuming responsibility for resource 
surveys and evaluations, formulating regional demarcations, 
thermal field development feasibility discussions, underground 
and surface engineering and thermal reserve engineering 
development, resource survey and utilization software 
development, and other tasks. Geothermal development and 
utilization is now progressing toward industrialization, 
systemization, and standardization. 
  China has only developed an extremely small portion of 
shallow-strata water heat-type geothermal resources at present, 
and we have not done research on dry heated rock-type geological 
resources, which have great potential. Petroleum departments 
have already discovered abundant ground pressure geothermal 
resources in the northern part of the South China Sea. The 
ground temperature gradient in the Yingqiong Basin is as much as 
4.25C/100 meters. At a borehole at Ledong, for instance, 
abnormally high pressures have been discovered at 3,000 meters 
with a pressure gradient at 5,021 meters of 19.2 kPa/meter, and 
there were nine gas-bearing strata (natural gas contained in the 
water). The discovery of this enormous geothermal resource has 
expanded China's development prospects. 
  Based on China's geothermal resource potential and the 
current situation in development and utilization, the key 
technologies for China's geothermal power generation and 
non-power utilization are still in the experimental stage for 
attacks on key problems. Overall, however, they could achieve 
industrial utilization and move into the market. Geothermal 
resources are characterized by being capable of compensation 
(developing dynamic reserves), clean, stable (not subject to 
seasonal interference), occupying small amounts of land, no 
residues, and so on, and they have excellent economic, social, 
and environmental benefits. They must be protected and replace 
unusually expensive basic chemical industry raw materials, and 
make the appropriate contribution to the conventional energy 
resources that are being exhausted. For this reason, we must use 
a strategic perspective in paying attention to and supporting 
them. 
  From projected geothermal power generation and non-power 
utilization in China (see Tables 3, 4, and 5), the amount 
developed by the year 2000 will be equivalent to 8,761,400 tons 
of standard coal and is expected to surpass 15.309 million tons 
of standard coal by the year 2020 and reach 142,183,400 tons of 
standard coal by 2050, which means that the time when our 
conventional energy resources are depleted will be the time that 
development of geothermal energy resources will flourish.

  The main problems and countermeasures at present: 
  1. Geothermal resources will exist or disappear jointly with 
the earth. People have an inadequate understanding of their 
potential, "renewability," and development prospects, and they 
still harbor doubts concerning the stability and reliability of 
their scientific utilization, which has affected the development 
of the geothermal energy resource industry. Thus, the 
development and utilization of geothermal resources must be 
focused on from strategic heights. 
  2. China's basic research on geothermal resources is poor, 
our technical measures are backward, we have little advanced 
equipment, our high-temperature geothermal exploratory drilling 
and development technology does not match up, and the state 
invests very little funds. It is hard to meet the requirements 
of economic development. 
  3. The high-temperature geothermal distribution region in 
southern Tibet, western Yunnan, and western Sichuan is also an 
economically backward frontier region with concentrated 
populations of national minorities. Using geothermal and 
small-scale hydropower for mutual supplementation to develop the 
economy, culture, environment, and ecology should be our energy 
resource development principle for unified planning. 
  4. Our southeast coast and the interior have abundant 
moderate and low-temperature geothermal resources and we must 
have unified planning and rational utilization, protect these 
resources, improve utilization grades, and adopt new 
technologies to increase geothermal energy utilization rates. We 
should build balneotherapy sites into tourism regions with 
beautiful scenery, such as Wenquan at Dongshan in Guangdong, 
Lintong in Shaanxi, Xinglong, Sanya, and Lanyang on Hainan, 
Wenquan City at Baiyangdian in Hebei, and others. 
  5. North China has geothermal resource cities and townships 
that can be utilized in a planned manner for heating to reduce 
environmental pollution from the burning of coal and reduce 
unnecessary pressures on coal haulage and residue removal. 
  6. The initial investments for developing geothermal 
resources are relatively large, and geothermal resource 
development activities require the state to provide policy 
supports and substantial economic guarantees to create the 
conditions for basic research and long-term development and 
prepare good comprehensive plans based on a regional demarcation 
of our national geothermal resources.

the China Wind Energy Technology Development Center, Beijing: 
"Development of China's Wind Energy"] 
  [Text] Following the worldwide petroleum crisis in the 
1970s that spurred the rapid development of new energy resources 
and renewable energy resources in the developed countries, the 
subsequent resolution of that crisis and falling petroleum 
prices have once again slowed the development momentum of new 
energy resources and renewable energy resources. During the past 
several years mankind has come to understand that fossil energy 
resource reserves are limited and that pollution from fossil 
energy resources has obviously destroyed the equilibrium between 
global space and the overall ecology on which mankind depends 
for its existence and that non-polluting new energy resources 
and renewable energy resources are truly energy resources on 
which it can rely. 
  Wind energy is a clean and renewable inexhaustible energy 
resource. Through more than 10 years of research and 
development, the technology is maturing and the economic and 
social benefits are apparent (the price of wind-generated 
electricity in the United States is $0.06 to $0.07 per kWh and 
will drop to $0.04 by the year 2000). As a result, the developed 
countries are competing to develop it and are investing large 
amounts of capital, formulating several medium and long-term 
development programs, and establishing all types of 
organizations to conduct R&amp;D (such as Denmark's (Lisuo) Wind 
Powered Generator Experiment Station, the United States Wind 
Energy Association, the Japan Wind Energy Association, the 
European Wind Energy Assocation, etc.). At the same time, all 
countries are competing to formulate the associated policies 
such as providing tax exemptions for private capital investments 
in wind energy in the United States and requiring that electric 
power companies purchase wind-generated electricity from 
wind-powered generating fields, and the implementation of a 
one-third subsidy from the state in Denmark for private 
purchases of wind-powered generators and permitting the sale of 
electricity to electric power companies. 
  Wind energy development and utilization in China has always 
been a concern of the state and several key wind energy projects 
were included among projects to attack key S&amp;T problems 
during 
the Sixth 5-Year Plan, Seventh 5-Year Plan, and Eighth 5-Year 
Plan. 
  China has now established an S&amp;T and production staff 
of more 
than 3,000 people, and we have established several 10 production 
plants (producing small-scale and large and medium-sized 
wind-powered machinery) with an annual small-scale wind-powered 
generator production capacity of 30,000 units, and development 
and production of 55 kW, 120 kW, and 200 kW wind-powered 
generators is now in progress. China as a whole has now extended 
120,000 small wind-powered generators and we have nine 
medium-sized and small wind-powered generating fields under 
construction. China's wind-powered installed generating capacity 
is now more than 20MW. As part of it, Inner Mongolia and 
Xinjiang have made enormous contributions to small wind-powered 
generator and large wind-powered generator demonstration, 
extension, and application. 
  China's wind energy development and utilization can be 
divided overall into four phases: Phase 1 involved the 
development of small 10 kW and smaller wind-powered generators. 
Phase 2 involved the commercialization, batch production, and 
extension of small wind-powered generators. Phase 3 involved the 
development of medium-sized 10 kW to 100 kW wind-powered 
generators. The present Phase 4 involves batch production of 
medium-sized wind-powered generators and the development of 
large (100 kW and up) wind-powered generators. The commercial 
wind-powered generators that China is now capable of producing 
in batch amounts are: 100 W, 150 W, 200 W, 250 W, 300 W, 500 W, 
1 kW, 3 kW, 5 kW, 20 kW, 30 kW, 40 kW, 55 kW, and 120 kW 
generators. China will be capable of small-batch production of 
the 200 kW wind-powered generators it developed around the end 
of 1995 to improve the situation of using foreign-made 
generators in our nine wind-powered generating fields in Inner 
Mongolia, Xinjiang, Liaoning, Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, 
Zhejiang, and other locations. 
  Moreover, China has developed its own eight varieties of 
wind-powered water-raising machinery with a maximum flow rate of 
up to 120 to 200 tons per hour and a maximum lifting height of 
140 meters, and the performance of certain devices has now 
attained international levels. Applications of China's 
wind-powered water raising machinery have already produced 
rather good economic results. For example, using FDG-7 
wind-powered water lifters for two-stage water raising in salt 
fields can conserve over 10,000 kWh of electricity annually for 
a savings of about 6,000 yuan. Wind-powered water lifting 
machinery used in the Tianjin region has produced very good 
economic results in desalination of vegetable fields and they 
are now making major efforts to extend them. 
  China is a developing country with a large population, vast 
territory, and shortages of energy resources. The development of 
new energy resources is a strategic shift for energy resources 
and can produce real benefits. Given China's technical 
capabilities, developing wind energy is certainly not something 
that cannot be attained. China's famous scientist Qian Xueseng 
[6929 1331 2773] wrote to the China Wind Energy Technology 
Development Center in 1991 describing the world's major efforts 
at present to develop wind energy and China's broad prospects 
for wind energy development and saying that we must develop them 
in a major way instead of just piddling around. 
  In June 1991, at the Wind Energy Construction Planning 
Conference held by the Ministry of Energy Resources, Minister 
Huang Yicheng [7806 3015 6134] pointed out that "developing wind 
energy requires that we foster everyone's initiative and that we 
get organized, improve our understanding of using wind power to 
generate electricity, and focus on wind-powered electricity 
generation as one force in overall electric power construction." 
  According to preliminary plans by the Ministry of Energy 
Resources, we will strive for an increase of 120 to 200MW a 
year. To achieve this objective, given China's existing wind 
energy technical forces, we should take the route of 
self-development, which means organizing China's wind energy 
experts on our existing technical foundation in a planned 
manner, absorbing the essence of advanced generators from 
foreign countries, developing large generators that conform to 
China's national conditions, and engaging in cooperation as 
appropriate with foreign businesses that are willing to provide 
technology as well as expanding the proportion of 
domestically-manufactured components and attaining a complete 
shift to domestic production. In the long term, some of our 
products should satisfy domestic demand and some of them should 
be exported to developing countries to attain a foreign exchange 
balance in the entire process. We must watch out that all 
departments do not engage in blind importing without conducting 
economic analysis. The State Science and Technology Commission 
and other ministries and commissions should control imports and, 
except in cases that have state permission, we should focus on 
protecting our own nascent industry, and the State Science and 
Technology Commission should increase its investments in wind 
energy R&amp;D. The State Economics and Trade Commission should 
increase its investments in the wind-powered machinery industry 
and strive to attain a domestic production rate of 80 percent 
for the wind-powered generators in China's wind-powered 
generating fields by 2000 to change the present lopsided 
development situation. 
  Currently, the international price of large wind-powered 
generators is about $900 to $1,000 per kW whereas the price of 
small domestic hydropower generators is 3,000 yuan renminbi per 
kW, so when they are being produced in large batches the price 
of China's large wind-powered generators could be 4,000 to 5,000 
yuan renminbi and each kWh of electricity about 0.04 yuan 
(large-scale development of wind energy would be best among new 
energy resources), so it would be entirely capable of competing 
with thermal power in regions that have electric power 
shortages. Wind-powered electricity on Nan'ao, Guangdong, has 
been welcomed by the local electric power bureau and the Nan'ao 
Island Electric Power company can sustain its existence now by 
selling electricity generated by wind power. Thus, we can affirm 
that with the state's guidance the development of wind energy 
will produce real benefits.

<F P=106> [Article by Dragan Djuric: "The Scutari Oil Pipeline"] </F>
  [Text] "God grant the sanctions continue," is the phrase 
used most frequently by those with whom we talked about the 
smuggling of petroleum products across Lake Scutari. The story 
about the wealth which people have amassed overnight explains 
the background of this strange prayer. 
  "Every day about 200 boats cross the (imaginary) border 
between Montenegro and Albania illegally on Lake Scutari," says 
someone very familiar with the flows of smuggled goods between 
Zeta, the rich farming region on the Montenegrin shore of the 
lake, and Vraka, the Albanian part of the Scutari region, which 
is mainly settled by Serbs and Montenegrins. 
  So, the southern Yugoslav republic has been managing to 
avoid 
isolation a full year longer than Serbia and has been regularly 
supplying the public with fuel. Since adoption of Resolution 
820, foreign tankers, mainly Greek, have had a harder and harder 
time running the NATO blockade in front of the port of Bar. Just 
before New Year's, the government announced that reserves had 
fallen so low that it was forced to "discontinue gasoline 
coupons for individuals." 
  Numerous private and government-owned firms became involved 
in the smuggling of petroleum products immediately after the 
sanctions were introduced toward the FRY; not long afterward, 
they were joined by resourceful individuals on both sides of the 
Montenegrin border. 
<H5>  The Oil Well </H5>
  The merchants in Scutari were the quickest to react. They 
installed double gas tanks in their cars and used them to carry 
gasoline across the border checkpoint at Bozaj for sale in Tuzi 
or Podgorica, which is only some 20 km or so from the border. 
Thus, the ancient meaning of the name of Tuzi, a small town 
midway between Podgorica and the Albanian border, has been 
restored. (The town, mostly settled by Albanians and Muslims, 
takes its name from the time when caravans carrying salt passed 
through, and the town came to be called Tuzi--"salt station.") 
  Almost every house in the town has become a small gasoline 
station. Car owners from Podgorica who need more than the 
limited amounts of gasoline (30 liters a month at the beginning 
and then 15 liters) go to Tuzi as though it were the nearest gas 
station. The reason, of course, lays in the price. The price of 
fuel in Tuzi has steadily been 20 to 30 percent lower than at 
the open-air markets in Podgorica. 
  People living in Zeta have been involved since this past 
autumn. They have begun to run the blockade in boats. They do 
not even need visas, which, because of the restrictions of the 
Albanian Embassy in Belgrade, are the greatest obstacle to 
crossing at Bozaj, the only border crossing between Montenegro 
and Albania. It is simple: You cross Lake Scutari in a rowboat 
to the town of Kamenica on the Albanian shore, without any kind 
of border or customs inspection; you are met there by your 
"trading partners" from what until recently was the most 
isolated country in the world, and they have drums full of 
petroleum products. The boats are used in this way to smuggle 
everything--from cigarettes to satellite dishes--but petroleum 
products and gasoline are the most common. Here are figures on 
how lucrative this entire operation is. The Albanians are paid 
between 160 German marks [DM] and DM190 for a 210-liter drum of 
petroleum products, depending on the quality, while in Zeta that 
same drum "sells at wholesale from DM210 to DM240 or even DM300." 
<H5>  The Fleet </H5>
  The heady rate at which money is earned is attractive for a 
great many people. In recent months, new boats are being built 
in large numbers or old ones repaired. One reason is that the 
traditional rowboats that the people of Zeta have used to fish 
Lake Scutari can take only five drums of petroleum products, and 
that exceeds the allowed load and presents a risk of capsizing 
and sinking in any kind of sea. So now the Zeta rowboats have 
sides which are four or five or more planks high, instead of the 
previous three, so that they can take a much larger load. Demand 
has also increased suddenly for drums, and there is a frantic 
demand for the metal plugs used with the drums. They carry a 
price of DM10, and the Aluminum Combine in Podgorica is faring 
the worst, because its employees are stealing large numbers of 
them. 
  The wind and waves are the greatest danger to the people in 
the boats. The boat ride from the Montenegrin to the Albanian 
shore in small boats takes an hour to an hour and a half, but 
coming back, because they are loaded, it takes about two and a 
half hours. Moreover, part of this is away from the shore of the 
lake (only 15 minutes or so of the trip), but this is where the 
seas are highest and there is a constant danger of sudden winds. 
In Albania, the drums containing petroleum products are loaded 
by hand, so that often the associates simply exchange full boats 
for empty ones. 
  On the Montenegrin shore, the transshipment technology is on 
a higher level. Tractor attachments are used to lift the drums 
from the rowboats, much in the way of a crane, and they are 
loaded onto trailers or trucks, and from there they are stored 
in farmyards. 
  Tank trucks carry the petroleum products from Zeta to other 
regions of Montenegro, Serbia, and the Serbian krajinas. The 
petroleum products are drained from the drums very quickly with 
a compressor or ordinary water pump. This job, our informants 
explained, even involves the Montenegrin government, which 
issues special certificates to individuals, according them the 
right to purchase and carry the smuggled petroleum products. 
<H5>  Chain </H5>
  The sudden wealth and the spirit of adventure which go with 
smuggling petroleum products across the largest lake in the 
Balkans have been generating many "hunting" stories about the 
exploits of the newly created "businessmen." It is thus said 
that there is no house in Zeta which has not earned at least 
DM10,000 or so from petroleum products. The earnings of a 
journalist from Montenegrin Television, who was among the first 
to become involved as a buyer and carrier, is estimated at DM2 
million. Albanian soldiers, who are said to intercept the 
smugglers, occasionally even quite amicably, are collecting 
bribes of DM10 per person. In order to dispel our disbelief, one 
of our informants pointed with pride to a new Mercedes tank 
truck, which he had just bought for DM130,000. "That came from 
petroleum products," he said. 
  The associates in Albania, we were told, are quite 
straightforward in their dealings. The Montenegrin and Albanian 
smugglers help one another, and it is not uncommon at all for 
them to visit one another for even several days (illegally, of 
course). 
  In Albania, it is prohibited to pump petroleum products into 
drums at filling stations, so that it is actually sold by the 
truckers, whose job comes down to cruising constantly around the 
gasoline stations. The petroleum products are usually of very 
poor quality. A great deal of kerosene (30 to 50 percent) is 
dumped into it, because in Albania it is cheaper--10 pfennigs 
per liter. So that engines can operate on this mixture, any kind 
of motor oil (usually used) is added to it. 
  The petroleum products go through five hands before they 
reach the ultimate consumer. The job also runs the risk that the 
police patrols, who are said to be increasingly numerous, will 
seize the petroleum products as they are being carried from Zeta 
in canisters. It is a long chain, and the links in it include 
both big operators, who order tank trucks by phone, and also 
erstwhile high school students waiting for customers in the 
open-air markets with plastic containers. Many firms whose 
trucks and buses have long been paying visits to farmyards in 
Zeta instead of the official Jugopetrol stations also rely on 
the newly opened "oil pipeline." 
  There is the smell of petroleum products at every step in 
Zeta. As you enter Zeta, our informants joke, there should be a 
"NO SMOKING" sign, just as there is at filling stations.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Egon T. Lansky, a journalist and political </F>
analyst who formerly served as Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry 
spokesman and ambassador to the Council of Europe: "After the 
Tragedy: A Look at Year One in the Two Republics"] 
  [Text] Despite being one of the staunchest defenders of 
Czechoslovakia until the very last minutes of its existence, I 
must admit that the majority of people in both successor states 
seem to have adapted to the new situation amazingly quickly. 
  Maybe that is always so with majorities. Life simply goes 
on, 
and most people cannot afford to do anything but try to hang on 
the best they can or else face the real existential dangers that 
seem to be lurking everywhere. 
  Passivity in the face of political decisions handed down 
from 
above, such as the unpopular split of the Czechoslovak 
federation, is, after all, what people in post-Communist 
societies have been used to for half a century, or even more. 
  People might even be suffering from a sort of social amnesia 
in reaction to the political shock treatment imposed by 
political leaders in both republics, and especially in Slovakia, 
where the negative consequences of the partition are much more 
obvious. 
  One year may be too soon to draw any final conclusions. 
Still, it is a natural milestone for initial observations and 
assessments of the "state of the states." If there were a final 
tally sheet of the direct expenses for each republic incurred as 
a result of the split, it would be much easier. But since I 
suspect we may never see that--when it comes to reliable 
statistics, we are far from having become real Western 
democracies--empirical facts will have to do. 
  As might have been expected, Slovakia seems to be the 
outright loser. It could have been even worse, though. Both 
inflation and employment are in double digits in Slovakia, but 
not any higher than in Poland or Hungary. 
  The Czech government, of course, prides itself on having 
kept 
the economy fully under control, even though, for all the 
official optimism, there are several clouds on the horizon. Most 
remarkably, Mr. Klaus and his team of economic ministers, while 
preaching an extremely conservative message, have been carrying 
out quite socialist economic policies. 
  They have maintained strict control over incomes (except for 
salaries of the political establishment, which went up 24 
percent before Christmas); controlled the prices of energy, 
housing and, occasionally, food and transportation; and 
postponed bankruptcies that could threaten anywhere from 15 to 
30 percent of all industries. These practices have served to 
push some problems into the future. And as long as this remains 
possible, the Czech government will sit comfortably. 
  No such luck for Mr. Meciar, who, on the contrary, seems to 
be the lone giant in Slovak politics after alienating even a 
good deal of his own party, the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia. That Meciar still runs the government can be explained 
by the fact that there is still no agreement either among the 
opposition parties or between the growing number of rebels 
within the two coalition parties. In Slovakia, there seems to be 
no political power interested in governing after Meciar; while 
in the Czech Republic, where the opposition appears to be even 
weaker, there is a government that is definitely not lacking in 
self-confidence. 
  For small, new states in the middle of the old continent, 
one 
of the most important interests must necessarily be 
international politics. Even more so now that the shining 
example of Czechoslovakia, once the standard-bearer of countries 
making a stable transition from communism to democracy, is no 
more. The new states will have to persuade the world of their 
qualities, redefine their geopolitical orientations, and try to 
realize their national interests under new and as yet unproven 
circumstances. 
  In this sense, it seems to me, both republics are in a 
significantly more disadvantageous situation than they were 
under the umbrella of the federation--especially Slovakia, which 
more than any of the countries of the Visegrad group became part 
of the true Eastern Europe. Its only borders with a true Western 
democracy are those few miles along the Danube with Austria near 
Bratislava. 
  Slovakia's drift toward clearly unstable regions such as the 
Commonwealth of Independent States and the Balkans is 
strengthened by tensions bubbling in the sough of Slovakia, 
where the large Hungarian minority is becoming increasingly 
alienated by growing Slovak nationalism. Slovakia's search for 
allies in Russia and Romania--something not only Mr. Meciar has 
been taking seriously of late--indicates as well as anything 
else the negative change in geopolitical realities. 
  Even the Czech Republic has found itself in a world more 
complicated than ever before. True, ridding itself of Slovakia 
was some soft form of "ethnic cleaning"--for the first time in 
more than 350 years there is an independent Czech state as 
homogenous as the Czech nation. But relations with the Czechs' 
largest and mightiest neighbor, Germany, have as a result of the 
split deteriorated in direct proportion to increased dependence. 
  The lack of coordination among the many politicians speaking 
on behalf of Czech foreign policy interests is not serving the 
country's interests. As a smaller state without a unified 
program, the Czech voice, calling loudly for security within 
international institutions, is going largely unnoticed.

  [Text] Enormous sums for lifting Albania's shockingly 
deficient health care system out of its miserable condition have 
been given over the past three years, but one-half billion 
Danish kroner [DKr] from the EU [European Union] Commission is 
being blocked because of Albania's inability to contribute some 
matching funds and because of a bureaucratic conflict between 
the Commission and the Albanian Ministry of Health. 
  "We want funds to set up a food inspection system, but the 
EU 
Commission doesn't want to use funds for this purpose, and so 
all payments to our public health sector have been halted," says 
Dr. Tritan Shehu, Albania's health minister. The EU Commission 
has earmarked DKr48 million, which has simply not been touched. 
In addition, another DKr160 million for renovating hospitals is 
untouched, because the Commission is requiring Albanian economic 
participation. 
  Altogether over the past three years, Albania has been 
granted DKr1.2 billion for EU programs, and the two largest 
grants totaling DKr560 million were outright gifts for this poor 
country. 
  EU Parliament member Freddy Blak, who has investigated the 
catastrophic conditions in Albanian institutions, is meeting 
today with Commission officials to ask for help.

<F P=106> [Article by Menton Shehu: "Questions About Haxhi Lleshi and </F>
Sabit Brokaj's Visit to the City of Debar, in Macedonia"] 
  [Excerpts] At a time when some "blockmen" [high-ranking 
members of the former Albanian Workers Party] are being tried in 
court for appropriating and squandering the people's wealth, the 
newspaper DITA INFORMACION publishes an interview with the 
former puppet of the Enver Hoxha government, Haxhi Lleshi. It is 
a dirty piece of writing, full of lies and absurd accusations 
against democracy and President Sali Berisha. On the basis of 
the penal code and the law on the press, this newspaper is being 
sequestered while the author of the article, Haxhi Lleshi, 
profiting from the indifference of the executor of the law, 
leaves the country for Debar. [passage omitted] 
  After throwing mud, in such a base manner, at the Number-One 
figure in the Albanian democratic state, why did Haxhi Lleshi go 
to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM], specifically, to the city of Debar? From the reports of 
well-informed and reliable eyewitnesses, we learn that Haxhi 
Lleshi was accompanied on his trip to Debar by an active member 
of the extreme left, a member of the leadership of the Socialist 
Party, Sabit Brokaj. 
  During his stay in Debar, Sabit Brokaj kept out of sight, 
far 
away from the meetings and out of the view of the residents of 
Debar. At the wedding of a cousin of H. Lleshi's, where people 
were having a good time and Haxhi Lleshi tried to get them to 
sing partisan songs and songs in honor of Enver [Hoxha], Mr. 
Brokaj was off in a room by himself, far away from the wedding 
guests. 
  Also, during Haxhi Lleshi and Sabit Brokaj's visit to that 
city, there was movement of individuals supporting H. Lleshi, in 
the direction of Gostivar, Tetovo, Skopje, and Belgrade. Nevzat 
Halili, the Macedonian card in the anti-Albanian policy in 
Macedonia, was fired. During this time, the Albanian Socialist 
Party did not say a thing about the problems and activity of the 
PPD [Party for Democratic Prosperity], because, it appears, 
things were going just as they had planned in their strategy in 
support of the Macedonian social-communists. 
  The silence was broken and the strategy failed with the 
exposure of the Nevzat Halilis, the elements who were sabotaging 
the Albanian cause in Macedonia. 
  In this crisis, specific circles in Macedonia are working 
with intensity in two directions. This cannot be done without 
the help of others, especially traditional friends. First, with 
subversive elements, to extend the crisis of the splitting up of 
groupings, to obstruct the rapprochement as long as possible so 
as to make it difficult to hold the Congress prior to the 
general census which will be held in Macedonia. Therefore, 
divide and conquer. Second, to put in the elected forums of the 
PPD branches, upto the PPD leadership, Macedonophiles, 
supporters of the former UDB [Yugoslav State Security 
Administration] in the guise of Albanian nationalism (who, until 
now, have remained in the shadows) and who, tomorrow, will 
continue the anti-Albanian policy of the Nevzat Halilis. 
  The PSSh [Albanian Socialist Pary] leadership has a clear 
and 
concrete political strategy in regard to the ethnic issue in the 
Albanian regions in Macedonia, Kosovo, and elsewhere. based on 
the political strategy of Enver Hoxha, which it has never 
abandoned but which it claims is a taboo in its practice. Haxhi 
Lleshi, the son of Halil Lleshi, a sworn Serbophile and 
anti-Albanian, is facilitating the progress of the Macedonian 
anti-Albanian policy. 
  There is no shortage of collaborationists to work with the 
lynchers of the Albanians. They have been and still are people 
without personality, people with narrow interests who, for 
various nefarious reasons, have fallen into the swamp of 
treason. The people recognized them even though they were 
camouflaged and they gave them hatred and contempt as 
recompense. The attitude of the citizens of Debar, etc., toward 
Haxhi Lleshi, that compromised figure of Enver Hoxha's regime, 
is proof of this.

<F P=106> [Article by Drazena Peranic: "Northern Corridor of </F>
Salvation"] 
  [Text] While dramatic appeals by hungry citizens have been 
coming from Tuzla, the Bosnia-Herzegovina oasis of coexistence, 
in Zupanja, a small Croatian town across the Sava opposite 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, hundreds of trucks have been standing and 
waiting to go to Tuzla. The news that trucks with aid for the 
citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina are waiting at a military 
checkpoint is certainly nothing new, but the attempt to 
transport the aid to the Tuzla region through the northern 
corridor, more exactly from Zagreb via Zupanja, Orasje, and 
Srebrenica to Tuzla, could change not only the humanitarian but 
also the political situation in the Tuzla and Posavina region. 
The action for opening the northern corridor called "The Road of 
Salt and Wheat -- Humanitarian Convoy of Love for Tuzla and 
Posavina" is organized by nongovernment organizations, primarily 
International Workers' Aid and the Tuzla Logistics Center, under 
the general patronage of the European Parliament, with the 
support of numerous individuals and the Croatian political 
opposition (Mika Tripalo, Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, Silvije Degen, 
Milorad Pupovac). We discuss this action, the situation in 
Tuzla, and the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Edhem Asceric, 
president of the organizational committee of the action for 
opening the northern corridor. 
  [Peranic] How did the idea of trying to open the northern 
corridor come about? 
  [Asceric] International Workers' Aid from London and the 
Tuzla Logistics Center have been trying for five months to 
accomplish the most natural thing -- the opening of the northern 
corridor to Tuzla. Trade organizations from Scotland, Ireland, 
Spain, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, 
and Slovenia have been included in this action. They drafted a 
miniprogram of activities for opening a northern corridor at a 
recent meeting in Stuttgart. The northern corridor was mentioned 
for the first time when the English workers delivered their aid 
for Tuzla to Split and remained there unable to continue because 
of the Croatian-Muslim conflict. We explained to them that Tuzla 
has never been connected with other towns or states through the 
southern corridor and that a highway exists on the northern 
side, which is the most natural and fastest way of linking the 
region of Tuzla and Posavina with Croatia and, farther away, 
with European countries. One could reach Zagreb via this 
corridor, i.e. a regular road, in less than five hours. 
  [Peranic] Nevertheless, you used the southern corridor 
through Herzegovina to central Bosnia and onward to Tuzla up to 
the beginning of the Croat-Muslim conflicts. 
  [Asceric] The use of the southern corridor to deliver 
supplies during the first year of the war was intentionally 
imposed by blockading Tuzla from all the other sides. Up to the 
beginning of the war, these roads were not used at all, except 
for forestry work, because the distance from Tuzla to Zagreb via 
these roads is about 1,150 kilometers, and one had to travel as 
long as three to four days even when there were no conflicts or 
war activities. Today, when this southern corridor does not even 
function and when it is the site of a major flashpoint, it is 
illogical to make efforts to use it for transportation of 
humanitarian aid to Tuzla, and it is questionable whether the 
aid would get there at all. Not long ago, in May 1993, a large 
convoy for Tuzla was attacked in this southern corridor. Many of 
our people died, and of the 476 vehicles only about 200 
half-empty vehicles made it to Tuzla, while the others were 
destroyed. Our total loss, in addition to the irreplaceable 
human losses, amounted to about 35 million German marks. 
  [Peranic] Recently a letter was sent from the Tuzla 
municipal 
government claiming that the situation regarding food supplies 
for residents and the numerous refugees is exceptionally 
difficult and that the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees was unsuccessful in delivering any kind of aid during 
the last month. 
  [Asceric] Humanitarian aid supply for Tuzla is very bad 
indeed. There are 226,000 inhabitants, of whom 130,000 are 
residents of Tuzla and the rest refugees from northern and 
eastern Bosnia. The United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees specifies in its program only the provision of aid for 
refugees and not for residents, and even this aid satisfies, 
according to the estimates of our statistics office, only 17 
percent of total needs. Unfortunately, the warehouses in the 
Republic of Croatia and in other European countries are full of 
goods intended for Tuzla, but they cannot be transported. Every 
day we set aside money for storage charges for these goods, 
because every square meter of storage area has its price. The 
goods are melting away, benefactors are impatient because we are 
unable to give them confirmation of the receipt of goods, and on 
the other hand, the residents of Tuzla cannot believe that 
nobody wants to help them. As you know, even after all the 
stories that have been told for months, the Tuzla airport 
remains closed, and only shells land on it. 
  [Peranic] In almost all the blockaded Bosnia-Herzegovina 
towns, goods that should have been distributed as humanitarian 
aid have been appearing on the black market. Is this also 
happening in Tuzla? 
  [Asceric] Of course. Those who are blockading Tuzla are 
bringing into the town goods which have not been allowed to 
arrive legally. In this way, they extract from the citizens 
their very last dinar or foreign currency which, in one way or 
another, was sent to them by their closest relatives abroad. The 
black market is very profitable in a war, and thus some are not 
at all interested in lifting the blockade of the town. An 
average salary in Tuzla is about four German marks, and prices 
on the black market are going wild: a kilogram of sugar is 40 
German marks, oil is 30 German marks, and flour as much as 40 
German marks, depending on the quantity of goods that have been 
smuggled into the town. Such a black market does not know of 
ethnic borders, what is important is to earn well. It is 
precisely for this reason that the multiethnically oriented 
government of Tuzla is interested in opening the northern 
corridor, because smuggling of food products would be hindered 
and prices of basic products would be guaranteed to remain at 
some rational and acceptable level. 
  [Peranic] If the average salary is 4 German marks, that 
means 
that some institutions and firms continue to work, despite the 
blockade. 
  [Asceric] Of course. Schools, university faculties, and some 
services sectors are working. Almost all the production sectors 
that are working are operating at reduced capacity. All our 
workers are threatened because they are dependent on the 
thermoelectric system. The circle is closing here, and problems 
are occuring. The Tuzla thermoelectric power plant capacity is 
869 megawatts, half of which is sufficient for the region. We 
used to export the rest: some of it to Sarajevo, some as far as 
Dalmatia, when it was on the brink of darkness. But today, as a 
result of the blockade, we are unable to bring raw materials for 
the mines -- powder, detonators, explosives, and crude oil -- 
and the thermoelectric power plant is working at reduced 
capacity. We have offered our cooperation to almost everyone in 
order to obtain raw materials. We even offered to let Croatia 
have their people come and distribute raw materials, in order to 
convince them that they were not used for military purposes, but 
nothing came of it. We cannot produce electricity because we 
cannot extract the coal, and, without electricity, we had to 
reduce the production of all products and resources in the 
polyurethane industry and the Dita detergent factory. If we had 
a roadway to transport raw materials, we could feed the entire 
region without any humanitarian aid, since the products of Tuzla 
are highly competitive. 
  Thus, if we were able to open this northern corridor, which 
is the most favorable roadway to Tuzla and if the passage 
through this road were open continuously, this would virtually 
mean the end of the war for us. The citizens not only of Tuzla 
but of other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina would have clear proof 
that they can live together without a war and ethnic hatred. 
Tuzla was and will remain the proof of this. 
  [Peranic] It seems that Tuzla is, in fact, blocked by all 
three sides, i.e. that intolerance toward Tuzla exists in all 
three ethnic groups in Bosnia- Herzegovina. The Serbian media, 
for example, have published that Selim Beslagic, the mayor of 
Tuzla and the president of the Reformists, has either been 
killed or arrested, while the Sarajevo media constantly accuse 
you of secessionism and of being autonomous. 
  [Asceric] Others want us to have autonomy more than we wish 
it ourselves. In spite of the three ethnic options which are 
against us, we believe that only two sides exist in the Tuzla 
region -- those who are for Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who are 
against it. Nationalistic programs were unfortunate for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and they only pointed to which ethnic 
group.one belonged in this state. The trouble is that everyone 
calls himself or wants to be called something other than what 
the name of their state is. Had they been calling themselves 
citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnians and Herzegovinians, 
there would be by far fewer problems than there are today. 
  I believe that the Tuzla multiethnic option will subsist, 
and 
it will expand all over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mr. Selim Beslagic 
is politically wise, and I think that one should listen to him. 
The citizens of Tuzla are together, and that is the greatest 
force. It is less important whether one is Orthodox, Catholic, 
or of the Islamic faith. Incidentally, the slogan of the party 
headed by Beslagic is worded like this: "Bosnia defends itself 
best in the Tuzla fashion."

  [Text] Banja Luka, 10 February -- On the territory of the 
Srpska republic and the republic of Serbian Krajina a unified 
payment operations' system with Serbia, that is to say, of the 
two Krajinas with Yugoslavia, is supposed to come into effect on 
Monday, it was announced at today's meeting of prime ministers 
and departmental ministers of the Srpska republic and the 
republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], held in Banja Luka. Prime 
Minister of the Srpska republic Vladimir Lukic and RSK Prime 
Minister Djordje Bjegovic confirmed at a news conference that 
the new dinar should be officially introduced into payment 
operations, which will be unified among the Serbian lands in the 
shortest possible time. 
  According to the latest information, the text of a protocol 
has just been completed in Belgrade, to which, among others, the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia has also given its consent. It is 
thus expected that as of Monday the new dinar will also be the 
official means of payment between Krajinas and the FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia]. There will be no more postponements, as 
this would incur great losses to both Krajinas.

  [Text] Dr. Nikola Koljevic, member of the presidency of the 
republic of Srpska, stated yesterday in an interview with the 
Zagreb weekly GLOBUS that "I think the resolution of the events 
in the republic of Serbian Krajina is to follow soon as 
intensive efforts are being made to correct overall Serbian- 
Croatian relations. And there are several ways to achieve the 
resolution. If Serbian and Croatian peoples were to act with 
maturity, they could achieve a historical agreement." 
  According to Dr. Koljevic, based on this "historical 
agreement" it would be possible to begin peaceful changes of 
borders. 
  "Alternately, it might also be possible to reach the 
agreement to give some kind of a very high political autonomy to 
the Serbs in Krajina, guaranteed by the Republic of Croatia. In 
any event, it would take a long time for people to accept this. 
I believe that economic activities will revive with time to 
contribute to a more rational resolution of problems."

republic of Srpska, took an exclusive photograph [reproduced in

this occasion, a Turkish F-16 fighter-bomber, as part of the 
NATO patrol that continuously flies in the skies over the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, encountered a humanitarian aid MI-8 
helicopter of the army of the republic of Srpska with visible 
Red Cross markings. Nonetheless, the Turkish pilot fired two 
short-range air-to-air Sidewinder missiles at the humanitarian 
aid helicopter. The Serbian pilots, through skillful antimissile 
maneuvers, avoided both Sidewinder missiles, and the lighted 
trail of these projectiles is seen in the lower left corner of 
the photograph. The Turkish F-16 fighter did not want to risk a 
new attack and got away from the area of this unusual aerial 
settling of accounts.

  [Text] Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of the army of 
the republic of Srpska, stated yesterday that "the Serbian side 
does not approve of the attempt to open Dubrava airport near 
Tuzla by force." 
  "No plane that might land there would ever be able to take 
off" Manojlovic specified in a conversation with TANJUG 
correspondent Vladimir Elez. At the same time he noted that 
"nobody has made any official request to discuss the possibility 
of opening Dubrava airport near Tuzla; threats to do it by force 
were used instead." 
  General Milovanovic recalled that the Serbian side had 
earlier granted the use of Sarajevo airport to the United 
Nations for humanitarian needs. "However, in order to achieve 
their own military objectives, the Muslims now want their own 
airport, and they want it in Tuzla." According to Milovanovic, 
this is fully consistent with the Muslim plans to establish 
territorial links between Tuzla, Zenica, and Sarajevo, and it 
reflects other military needs as well. 
  As for Srebrenica, General Milovanovic stressed that "this 
is 
an imaginary problem. As far as the Serbian side is concerned, 
the replacement of the Canadian unit in Srebrenica was never a 
problem, nor is it now." He concluded that in essence the latest 
events involving Tuzla and Srebrenica represent "a new attempt 
to encourage the Muslim side to continue the war."

Association With Non-Economic Goals"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  General Principles </H6>
<H5>  Article 1 </H5>
  The Movement for Rights and Freedoms is an independent 
social-political organization, established to contribute to the 
unity of Bulgarian citizens, as well as to respect the rights 
and liberties of all ethnic, religious, and cultural communities 
in Bulgaria, in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the 
country, the International Charter on the Rights of Man, the 
European Convention for the Protection of the Rights of Man, and 
international treaties. 
<H5>  Article 2 </H5>
  The basic goals of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
are: 
  2.1. The attainment of understanding and unity among 
Bulgarian citizens through the shaping of a consistent and 
explicit policy on the national question, while defending the 
rights and liberties of all communities in the country. 
  2.2. The concordance of national legislation with 
international principles and norms for ensuring the rights and 
liberties of ethnic, religious, and cultural communities in 
Bulgaria. 
  2.3. The establishment of legal and social guarantees 
against 
the toleration of ethnic or religious hatred or discrimination 
and for equality with respect to the rights, liberties, and 
social security of all communities. 
  2.4. Economic prosperity and environmental protection in all 
oblasts [districts] and obshtinas [townships] in the country, as 
well as the overcoming of disproportionate development of 
different areas of settlement. 
  2.5. The striving to unconditionally help and support the 
foreign policy of the Republic of Bulgaria, which will promote 
and strengthen the authority of our country in the world, based 
on correct and mutually beneficial relations on an equal basis 
with all countries that want such relations. In particular, the 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms considers that one of the 
principles to be stressed in our country's foreign policy should 
be the strengthening of peace and understanding in the Balkans 
and the establishment of normal, good-neighborly relations with 
all the neighboring countries. 
<H5>  Article 3 </H5>
  The achievement of the goals of the Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms will be accomplished through the following legal 
means: 
  3.1. Preparation of a proposal to the organizations of state 
authority and administration for the improvement of the 
country's legislation in accordance with basic rights and 
liberties of citizens. 
  3.2. Joint activity with all the democratic forces in 
solving 
the problems connected with humanizing social relationships and 
the creation of conditions for economic prosperity and the 
confirmation of Bulgaria as a law-governed state. 
  3.3. Cooperation with international organizations, 
establishing contacts, and carrying out international activities 
to guarantee basic rights and liberties for all Bulgarian 
citizens, including those citizens belonging to differing 
economic and religious communities. 
  3.4. Investigating the warnings by citizens and informing 
the 
competent state organizations in the case of infringements of 
basic rights and liberties, [use of] language for communication, 
religious freedom, education, freedom and equality to 
participate in social-political life, equal payment for work, 
and social security of the individual. 
  3.5. Organization of various forms of discussion of current 
problems of national policy and for law-abiding public 
expression in the event of violations of the basic rights and 
liberties of citizens. 
  3.6. Dissemination of printed material according to the 
existing laws in Bulgaria with the intention of promoting a 
legal, civil, and religious culture. 
<H5>  Article 4 </H5>
  4.1. Any Bulgarian citizen of legal age, who is for the 
unity 
and indissolubility of Bulgaria, who fights for unification and 
tolerance, while recognizing the equal rights and liberties of 
all Bulgarian citizens, including those who belong to different 
ethnic and religious communities, and opposing all 
manifestations of national chauvinism, revanchism, fascism, and 
religious fanaticism, can be a member of the Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms. 
  4.2. The acceptance of a member in the Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms begins with a written request from the candidate, 
submitted to the local council, which passes judgment on the 
application within a seven-day period. 
  4.3. Each member of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms can 
establish his identity as a member by using his membership 
booklet, which is subject to authentication annually, when his 
membership dues, which must be paid regularly, are collected.

the right to elect or be elected to leadership bodies in the 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms. 
  4.5. Membership in the Movement for Rights and Freedoms is 
voluntary and can be relinquished at any time at the request of 
an individual member, when he presents his request to withdraw

  4.6. Any member of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms who 
does not carry out his responsibilities ensuing from this 
Statute or engages in an activity incompatible with the goals 
and mission of the Movement can be expelled from it by a 
decision of the local organization to which the member belongs 
or through a decision by a higher body. A recommendation to 
expel a member is made by the leadership of the local 
organization or a higher body, and the reasons for the decision 
are given. The decision is made through open voting by a 
qualified majority (two-thirds) of the members of the competent 
body. A decision to expel a member is submitted for appeal to 
the Ethics Commission within a 14-day period. A decision for 
expulsion that is made by the National Conference is not 
submitted for appeal.

a 
member of another political party or organization, or is not a 
Bulgarian citizen may not become a member of the Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms. Disfranchisement or repudiation of 
Bulgarian citizenship leads automatically to a curtailing of 
membership. Individuals who are Bulgarian citizens but live 
outside Bulgaria can become members of the Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms but do not have the right to assume responsibility 
for leadership in the organization. 
  4.8. Collective membership is not permitted in the Movement

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The Belgrade daily POLITIKA, in an 
article entitled "Bonn Continues To Protect Zagreb" published on 
page 7 of its 7 February issue, writes that while, on one hand, 
the Croatian leadership is being threatened with "empty words" 
for the policy it is conducting in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 
demonstration that all participants in the bloodshed in Bosnia 
are being treated equally, Germany, in fact, continues to 
protect Croatia. POLITIKA notes that this is confirmed in that 
day's Croatian newspapers which "conspicuously published the 
information that German defense officials have denied Croatian 
military involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for which Croatia 
has been threatened with international sanctions in a most 
serious way." 
  POLITIKA states that while it is clear to the citizens of 
Croatia that the country's army is participating in the fighting 
in neighboring Bosnia- Herzegovina because the citizens 
themselves are being "mobilized and taken across the border, 
many returning in coffins," the defense attache at the German 
Embassy in Zagreb, Colonel Per Shvan [name transliterated from 
Cyrillic] claims that he had just visited units of the 7th Guard 
Brigade of the Croatian Army which are stationed in the area of 
Sibenik and Zadar and that he has established that the brigade 
is "intact" and that it is not active outside of the territory 
of the Republic of Croatia. POLITIKA notes that this is the 
brigade reported to be fighting the Muslims in central Bosnia. 
  Colonel Shvan, who was accompanied on this "inspection" by 
representatives of the German Defense Ministry, stressed that he 
would inform appropriate officials in Germany of his findings, 
POLITIKA reports. 
  "Thus Croatia was provided with the argument -- precisely by 
the German side -- that it is not involved in the battles in 
neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. The German representatives did 
not visit the citizens who have been forcibly mobilized in the 
Kroacija Barracks in Zagreb, from where they are sent to the 
battlefield in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although even some Croatian 
newspapers have written about this and published the names of 
persons jammed into military prisons for refusing to go to the 
undeclared war in the neighboring state," POLITIKA concludes.

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe arrived in 
Zagreb late this evening. His meeting with Croatian 
representatives, headed by the Croatian president, began some 50 
minutes ago. We have just established phone contact with the 
minister of foreign affairs and deputy prime minister of 
Croatia. Good evening Mr. Granic. You ended the meeting with 
Mr. Juppe about 10 minutes ago. Could you tell us briefly why 
Mr. Juppe arrived Zagreb this evening. 
  [Granic] To explain NATO's decisions adopted in Brussels. 
This means that the warning issued to the Serb side is really 
serious but pressure is also exerted on all sides, including the 
Muslim side, to negotiate seriously. The negotiations should be 
based on the European Union plan, and what is most important is 
that the Americans are also supporting it now. This is an 
entirely new element. Croatia accepted the plan a long time 
ago. It was not difficult for us to attend the Geneva talks 
today because Croatia firmly supported the plan. 
  [Announcer] Did Mr. Juppe mention any new elements as far as 
American and French political initiatives are concerned? 
  [Granic] There are no new important elements in the plan but 
what is new and important is that for the first time America 
made it clear that it supported the plan and that it would make 
its diplomatic presence more visible and maybe on a higher 
level. As you know Mr. Tanner who is the assistant secretary of 
state has arrived in Paris and he will go to Geneva tomorrow 
along with Ambassador Redman. In any case they will help in 
urgent and serious resumption of the negotiations and on the 
other hand to implement the decisions and the NATO ultimatum. 
  [Announcer] Let us return to today's events in Geneva. 
Please tell us whether Russia's mild disagreement with this 
plan devised by NATO, the United States, and France could fuel 
the Serbs' intransigence. 
  [Granic] I spoke with Mr. Churkin today. The Russian 
Federation requested the urgent convocation of a UN Security 
Council session. This did not happen although a session will 
take place tomorrow with the possibility for all countries to 
take part in the debate. The Bosnia-Herzegovina issue will be 
discussed in global terms. This is a positive thing. We 
believe the Russians will not be allowed to frustrate NATO's 
decision, which is firm. 
  [Announcer] Let us review what happened in Geneva today. It 
seems to me that this decision signed by you and Silajdzic is 
nothing spectacular but that it nevertheless heralds a certain 
thaw between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia and between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 
  [Granic] I agree. It is certainly not spectacular but it is 
an important step forward. The situation in the field is well 
known and everyone knows what it was like in the past. The 
talks were held in an open and constructive atmosphere and 
certain very important things were agreed -- a meeting will be 
held between the commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and 
the Croatian Defense Council, Generals Roso and Delic, and they 
will discuss a definitive truce. 
  Second, we seriously discussed prisoners and refugees. We 
agreed that the Croatian and Muslim sides would send letters to 
the UN Security Council, demanding the supervision of borders. 
  [Announcer, interrupting] I'm sorry, has Croatia also 
proposed inspection of its units, although this was not 
contained in the declaration. 
  [Granic] Croatia will propose this tomorrow and will also 
demand the establishment of safe areas in central Bosnia. This 
will be demanded tomorrow in a letter I will be sending to the 
chairman of the UN Security Council. 
  [Announcer] We should clarify this concept of safe areas -- 
would these zones be similar to the ones in Srebrenica and 
Gorazde or would they be more like the one around Sarajevo? 
  [Granic] We will demand what is known as safe havens. This 
is similar to Gorazde and Srebrenica. This will be the fourth 
time we are demanding such a thing. But this time we have more 
of a chance, considering NATO's decision on the one hand, on the 
other, the climate has changed altogether. The possibility of 
sanctions [against Croatia] has almost completely disappeared 
after these talks. 
  [Announcer] I will take the liberty of making a conclusion 
here -- it seems that Croatian diplomats have made several 
exceptionally good moves lately, especially since the Livno 
assembly, and that the threat of sanctions has become a thing of 
the past. 
  [Granic] I believe that today's talks have really brought us 
closer to the time when there will be a lasting cessation of 
hostilities between the Croats and Muslims and a final agreement 
will be reached on setting up relations. This will not be an 
easy task, there are still many obstacles, but we are certainly 
far from any sanctions. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Granic, thank you for your understanding and 
willingness to grant this interview.

daily POLITIKA on page 7 carries an interview with Veljko 
Knezevic, new head of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] 
diplomatic office in Zagreb. Knezevic reveals to POLITIKA that 
he was born in the vicinity of Knin and that he had lived in 
Zagreb for 40 years, before leaving in 1990, when "first 
unpleasantnesses started," after resigning from the position of 
director of Radio-Television Zagreb. Knezevic states that the 
FRY office will be located in the center of Zagreb, "three 
tramway stops away from the place where he used to live." 
POLITIKA states that Knezevic personally knows many current 
Croatian leaders, including his successor at Croatian Television 
-- Antun Vrdoljak. Answering a question on the order in which 
the normalization of relations between the FRY and Croatia will 
be carried out, he responds that first postal, then railroad, 
and finally road links will be established.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prof. Dr. Zdravko Sancevic, Croatian </F>
ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Salih Zvizdic; place and 
date not given: "If I Did Not Have Faith in the Alliance with 
the Muslims, I Would Not Be Ambassador"] 
  [Text] The Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Prof. Dr. Zdravko Sancevic, says that he has an intimate 
knowledge of Bosnia. Not only does he easily bandy about 
historical data; more importantly, he is also completely 
familiar with the people and customs there. He was born 62 years 
ago in the town of Crkveni, near Teslic, in the Usore valley, to 
a large family in which the father was an industrialist in the 
lumber business and a Croat HSS [Croatian Peasants Party] 
politician. In 1945, he and his father had to flee to Austria by 
way of Bleiburg, then to Italy, and finally to the United States 
and Venezuela. He ended up studying geology in the United 
States, after which he was chosen to be a professor at a 
university in Caracas. 
  After 1945, he first traveled to Croatia in 1990 at the 
invitation of President Tudjman, and afterward he returned to 
Venezuela where he was elected chairman of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] Coordinating Committee for Venezuela and 
South America. His second trip to Croatia was in August 1992, 
when he reported as a volunteer for the National Guard Corps. 
Since September 1992, he has been the ambassador of the Republic 
of Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He is married and has eight 
children, and his family lives in Venezuela, where they all own 
property and have jobs. 
  He tells me that the wartime conditions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina thwarted his efforts to locate the embassy in 
Sarajevo back in September 1992, and in Mostar later on, so that 
the Croatian Embassy was opened in Medjugorje in August 1993. He 
would like to move with the embassy to Sarajevo as soon as 
possible. 
  He comments briefly on the visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina 
by the Turkish and Pakistani prime ministers, Tansu Ciller and 
Benazir Bhutto. 
  [Sancevic] It is clear that the Islamic countries are 
interested in everything that is going on in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and that they want to see things firsthand, to talk with the top 
people. These are normal contacts between countries, although in 
this case the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina does not exist in the 
form in which it is internationally recognized; rather, it 
exists under extremely complex conditions. 
  [Zvizdic] How was the declaration received in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Sancevic] It is hard to speak on behalf of all of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, because there are three sides. 
  [Zvizdic] I mean representatives of the Bosnjak-Muslim 
republic, which has been generally accepted as the territorial 
designation for one of the three sides ever since President 
Tudjman's peace initiative in Bonn. 
  [Sancevic] The Muslims, some of whom call themselves 
Bosnjaks, have not constituted their republic because they 
contend that they are the inheritors of the international rights 
of all of Bosnia-Herzegovina. You see, these Muslims, or 
Bosnjaks, had almost no public reaction to the Geneva 
Declaration, because they too are negotiating with the Serbs. If 
Izetbegovic signed an agreement with Krajisnik saying that the 
Serbs can secede after two years, then things are clear, 
although later there were various interpretations of that 
agreement coming from the Muslim side, and even rejection of the 
Serbs' right to secede. This comes as no surprise to people who 
know the situation, because there are several political factions 
in the Muslim ranks. 
  [Zvizdic] Can you identify the factions? 
  [Sancevic] It is no secret that the line represented by 
Ganic 
is absolutely opposed to anything that smells of an alliance 
with the Croats. That is the Sandzak hard line. 
  [Zvizdic] Does that mean that it is pro-Serb? 
  [Sancevic] I would rather not get into that, because that 
calls for lengthy elaboration, but I know that it is not 
pro-Croat. On the other hand, there is the Haris Silajdzic 
faction that previously demonstrated a partiality for the West, 
the Croats, and Croatia. However, in recent times that faction 
has become rather radicalized in a negative sense toward Croatia. 
  [Zvizdic] What caused that? 
  [Sancevic] I think that everyone in Sarajevo is surprised by 
the tenacity of the defense in central Bosnia, because they 
expected those Croat enclaves to fall. This was followed by 
those charges of involvement by the Croatian Armed Forces [HV], 
but I would rather not go into that because those are military 
affairs. There is also a third faction, the mojahedin one, which 
is the most radical one, although perhaps not numerically large, 
but it is aggressive, violent. 
  [Zvizdic] Who heads up that faction? 
  [Sancevic] Look, with these "secret" movements and 
organizations, it is hard to decidedly name the actual leader, 
especially in a situation where a significant share of the 
Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina do not support mojahedin 
radicalism. Moreover, the majority of Islamic countries, no 
matter how strange it may seem to some people, are rigorously 
opposed to extremists, energetically fighting the 
mojahedin-fundamentalist faction in their own states. But I 
maintain that this faction exists in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it 
will impose itself on others, with more or less success. 
  [Zvizdic] Is there also an Alija Izetbegovic faction, or is 
Izetbegovic's policy the end product of all these factions? 
  [Sancevic] It is clearly not an end product, but rather the 
political acrobatics of accommodation, because Izetbegovic is 
first with this faction, then with another, and then with a 
third. That is the source of the elements of inconsistency in 
his policy and of his positions in general on a number of issues 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and beyond. There have been so many times 
that he has refuted his own words as a result of the momentary 
power of individual factions. 
  [Zvizdic] What about the Muslim armed forces? Toward whom do 
they lean? 
  [Sancevic] Everything about the armed forces is extremely 
complicated for all three sides, because in some places the 
Croats and Muslims are allies in the war against the Serbs, in 
some places they are fighting each other, while in other places 
there is Croat collusion with the Serbs but also fighting 
between the Croat and Serbs. It is a rather complex situation, 
with "dog eat dog" being the prevailing rule, but I still think 
that Izetbegovic has strong influence over his armed forces, 
although it is clear that some local commanders do not listen to 
him. 

<H5>    People Never See Most of the Dollars </H5>
  [Zvizdic] Where are the Muslims getting arms and ammunition? 
  [Sancevic] Such matters belong in the military domain, but 
it 
is possible to say a little something. There are several sources 
of arms: First, there was plenty left behind in the depots of 
the former Territorial Defense; second, a significant number of 
arms and ammunition factories are located on territory held by 
the Muslims (Konjic, Bugojno, Travnik and Novi Travnik, Zenica, 
Tuzla); third, the Croats have given the Muslims a lot of 
weapons; fourth, the Muslims are buying weapons from various 
sources, inside the country and beyond, because when someone has 
money they can buy and acquire anything. It should not be 
forgotten that the Muslim side is getting very valuable aid in 
dollars from Islamic countries and other sources, and that the 
people never see most of this money; rather, it remains abroad 
where it is spent for war purposes. 
  [Zvizdic] What is your current assessment of the balance of 
power among the belligerents in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Sancevic] I would say that the Serbs, who have achieved the 
most militarily, have achieved everything that they set out to 
achieve, and now they would rather not be fighting, preferring a 
political resolution according to their criteria. The Croats are 
also for a political resolution because they have a realistic 
assessment of the situation. The most absurd thing is that the 
militarily weakest side, the Muslim one, wants a military 
resolution, which Izetbegovic declares publicly--they want war! 
That is why they need weapons, because they have the people. 
Most of the Muslims' military forces are concentrated in Zenica, 
15 km from Vitez, Busovaca, in other words central Bosnia. Their 
people are dying, but new people are continuously arriving. Not 
too much value is attached to human life there, especially among 
the mojahedin, who are fighting in the belief that if they die 
while fighting for a holy cause, they will live in paradise in 
the hereafter. 

<H5>    Croats Not Indifferent About Border </H5>
  [Zvizdic] It is being said in the foreign press and in the 
Sarajevo media that an alliance between the Serbs and Croats in 
the war against the Muslims was agreed to in the Geneva 
Declaration. 
  [Sancevic] Any affirmative response to that rumor would draw 
into question the consistency of President Tudjman's policy, 
would mean that that policy is hypocritical. And that is not 
true! No one has forced me to follow President Tudjman's policy; 
rather, I accept that policy as my own conviction, because I am 
convinced that that policy regarding Bosnia is fully justified. 
The Croats have agreed to all previous international options on 
resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the Cutileiro 
proposal to the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, but agreements have 
faltered primarily on the issue of territory. The military 
situation today is such that the Serbs have pushed the Muslims 
out of eastern Bosnia, the Muslims are pushing the Croats out of 
central Bosnia, so that the Croat resistance to a further loss 
of territory is understandable. They cannot be indifferent to 
whether their border with the Bosnjak-Muslim republic, if that 
is what we call it, is at Lasva or at the upper Vrbas or at the 
lower Neretva, i.e., at the sea. The Muslims are insistently 
demanding an outlet on the sea, and a lot of the process has 
gotten stuck on that point. 

<H5>    They Do Not Want the Sea for Swimming </H5>
  [Zvizdic] Do you want to say anything else about this 
demarcation? 
  [Sancevic] President Tudjman has said all this very clearly, 
and he consistently puts forward these views, from the demand 
that the primary goal is to save lives and the need for Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina to have their own territory, such as 
Herceg-Bosna, to appreciation for the need to find solutions in 
ethnically mixed areas--and the Croats are almost exclusively 
mixed with Muslims--that will fully respect all the rights of 
the three nations. According to the peace initiative that 
President Tudjman put forward in Bonn, there is also the variant 
of a federation or confederation with a possible Bosnjak-Muslim 
republic, in which case issues concerning an outlet on the sea 
would fall away, because everyone would have the same rights. 
  Izetbegovic does not accept that because he wants his own 
outlet on the sea, but not in order to go swimming there, but 
rather for strategic reasons. Fine, an outlet on the open seas 
could, if necessary, be closed in terms of the adjacent Croatian 
islands, but what will happen if some stronger force comes along 
and wants to use this Muslim outlet on the sea, which must be 
expected in a political-strategic sense! The situation with the 
Sava basin is also complex. 

<H5>    Corridor and Sava Basin </H5>
  [Zvizdic] The biggest problem there concerns the Serb 
corridor. 
  [Sancevic] There are people in the Sava basin and people 
from 
there who are now living elsewhere who think that everything 
should be as they have conceived of it in their own heads. 
Others have a realistic view of the situation there, while 
others still are considering some sort of compromise. 
Unfortunately, under certain other partition plans the Serbs 
gained a corridor across the Sava basin, which is a jugular vein 
for the so-called Serb republic and so-called Krajina, because 
that is how the people, food, and weapons that Belgrade is 
sending to Bosnia-Herzegovina and the occupied parts of Croatia 
are passing. That corridor is wide at the western end, extending 
from Doboj to Derventa and beyond to the Sava in the north; it 
is narrowest at Brcko, and then widens again toward Bijeljina. 
  Aside from the Serb towns surrounding Brcko--Pelagicevo, 
Zabare, and Obudovac--which the Serbs systematically settled 
with soldiers from the Salonika front back in the first 
Yugoslavia, and which they reinforced in the second Yugoslavia 
in order to break up the Croat-Muslim majority there, Serbs are 
in the minority in this region. The Muslims are in the majority 
in Brcko, and all around there are plenty of Croat and Muslim 
towns leading from Majevica toward Brcko. 
  It appears that they are holding open the prospect of the 
so-called southern route if the Sava corridor does not work out. 
However, that route passes over mountains, so that it is easier 
to cut off, while the Sava route is on flat land and is much 
more suitable to them. 
  [Zvizdic] After everything that has happened and is 
happening, do you believe in some future alliance between the 
Muslims and Croats? 
  [Sancevic] I firmly believe in it, because if I did not, I 
would not be here, I would not be the ambassador. I declare to 
you that all of President Tudjman's peace initiatives have 
included the desire for an alliance between the Croats and 
Muslims, because that alliance is in the interest of Croats from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. That is the policy of the 
Croatian leadership, and I am working on it as much as I can. I 
also enjoy strong support in this, among other things, from the 
Croats of Muslim faith and from the Muslims who through their 
political convictions and party affiliation with the Croatian 
Muslim Democratic Party and the Muslim Democratic Party for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina clearly show that the SDA [Party of 
Democratic Action] does not have a political monopoly among 
adherents of the Muslim faith. My conviction in this regard is 
very clear. 

<H5>    Stalling the Investigation Is Also a Crime </H5>
  [Zvizdic] What is your assessment of the threat of sanctions 
by the UN Security Council? 
  [Sancevic] Confusion has arisen here surrounding sources of 
information, because all the secret services are working to pick 
up something and rush to announce it to their own people without 
looking at the whole story. Croatia has asked and received 
permission from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government to keep its 
troops on Bosnia-Herzegovina soil in territory above Dubrovnik. 
As far as the allegation that HV units are in central Bosnia is 
concerned, that is a tall tale, because that conclusion cannot 
be drawn on the basis of the fact that HV identification cards 
were found on several captured HVO [Croat Defense Council] 
soldiers, while Croatia has said publicly that there are 
volunteers there who previously fought in HV units. 
  [Zvizdic] What is your interpretation of the tragedy at the 
Sarajevo market? 
  [Sancevic] Regardless of the results of the investigation, 
the crimes must be halted. Stalling the investigation, but also 
stalling an end to the killing, is nothing other than an excuse 
for the immorality of those who are conducting this 
investigation and everything surrounding it at a snail's pace. 
This is clearly not incidental, and that too is a crime.

<F P=106> [Article by Ssava Jankovic; "pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Knin, Feb 16 (TANJUG)--Veritas, a non-government 
organization of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RSK), has published 
sections of a document containing proof that regular Croatian 
Army troops had over the past two years killed and butchered at 
least 140 Serb civilians and 48 RSK police prisoners in three 
locations alone. 
  Veritas revealed only a part of the collected evidence on 
the 
massacre of the Serbs in the territory of the ex-Yugoslav 
Republic of Croatia. Some of the evidence was obtained by the 
U.N. Protection Force and has already been sent to the 
International War Crimes Tribunal. 
  In keeping with the Vance plan, RSK was in 1992 proclaimed a 
U.N. Protected Area (UNPA) until a political solution is reached 
in the dispute between Croatia the RSK. 
  RSK was proclaimed by the local Serbs within the 
administrative borders of the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in 
parts where they are in the majority and in response to 
Croatia's secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and the 
harassment of the Serbs by the Croatian authorities. 
  The documents testify about the mass crimes committed by the 
Croatian Army during its aggression on RSK on June 21, 1992 (on 
the Miljevac plateau), and on January 22 and September 9, 1993 
on the Ravne Kotari area (operation Maslenica), i.e. on the Serb 
villages of Citluk, Divoselo and Pocitelj in Lika (Medak pocket). 
  The Croat aggression on Citluk, Divoselo and Pocitelj left 
71 
Serb civilians dead. The bodies of 52 were later handed over to 
the Serbs, while the reminder was found by the U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) after the Croat forces were driven away from 
the razed and burnt villages. 
  "I did not find any sign of either human or animal life ... 
The destruction was complete and intentional," said UNPROFOR 
commander for Former Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot, after touring 
the ruins of the Serb villages. 
  Pathology reports show that the victims had been killed from 
close quarters. Some bodies had as many as 20-30 bullet wounds, 
while a number were butchered. 
  In operation "Maslenica," the Croatian Army also refused to 
spare the civilians, women, children and the elderly, killing 44 
Serb civilians, including 27 women. 
  On the day of the aggression, one half of the Benkovac 
region 
(RSK territory) - 16,000 people - fled their homes in 
kilometre-long columns. That day, 109 feeble old people died en 
route. 
  On the Miljevacki plateau, the Croatian Army brutally killed 
48 imprisoned Serb policemen from the Knin area by first 
severing their limbs and ears, and then pushing them into 20 m 
pits in the Drinovci village. 
  The bodies of the Serb police were butchered to such an 
extent that identification of 16 was virtually impossible. 
  Seventeen Serb fighters managed to survive the Miljevac 
massacre. Jovan Mirkovic (46) from Kovacici, near Knin, says 
that in the Sibenik prison the prisoners were tortured with 
electricity, and starved and beaten. 
  "They kicked and threatened us for three nights in a row. I 
was told my eyes are good for target practice," says Mirkovic 
who had three ribs broken and was bruised all over. 
  In Gospic, city in Croat territory, the Croat police on the 
night of October 16 arrested and took in an unknown direction 
some 150 prominent Serbs. The bodies of 24 were returned in 
January 1992, while the whereabouts of the others remains 
unknown. 
  The killing of the Gospic Serbs was conducted by Tomislav 
Mercep, a senior official in the Croatian Interior Ministry. 
  Savo Strbac, the director of Veritas and a lawyer, says that 
the truth about the atrocities against the Serbs committed after 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman came into power, is finding 
its way into the world with difficulty. 
  "No-one wanted to receive and broadcast to the world the 
clear proof about who is the aggressor and who the victim in 
this war," Strbac says.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Drazen Vukov-Colic: "A Silent Commemoration"] </F>
  [Text] Mate Boban has gone, but the Declaration of the 
Chamber of Representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna 
has not announced any significant changes in the Herzegovinian 
view of the uncertain future of all the Bosnian Croats. Both 
Zagreb and Livno have thus stopped for a step, in the attempt to 
give a political answer to the impossible question of "the 
chicken or the egg," and thus sacrificed only what a great part 
of the world and a significant number of Croats, both in Bosnia 
and in Croatia, have labeled a rotten egg that could stink up 
the entire basket. Mate Boban has gone, Karadzic is still 
firmly in the saddle, and Alija Izetbegovic has not yet been 
significantly threatened by Fikret Abdic's rebellion, so it was 
only the Croats (read: the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]) 
who roamed around and lost their way among the idealist Stjepan 
Kljujic, the trouble-making Ivo Perinovic, and the extreme Mate 
Boban, in which the curve kept jumping and trembling between 
impotence and stupidity. Thus Mate Granic, whose feet Mate 
Boban was constantly under, like a tongue-tied sidekick (because 
he does not know a word of English), has finally had to appear 
in Livno in the role of an elegant executor who, in the 
long-awaited scene, paraphrases the famous Shakespeare verses: 
"He was an honorable man, but...." 
  What can Mile Akmadzic, who for months had been prepared for 
the role of heir apparent, do now? The international media, 
which can sometimes expose things to the bone, claim that Mate 
Boban was very useful when the Croat defense had to be organized 
during the conflict with the Serbs, but very harmful when he 
became involved in the war with the Muslims, which has brought 
Croatia before the wall of international sanctions. Those who 
have met him privately claim that he even secretly admired the 
Serbs, while he never gave an inch to the Muslims, something 
literary connoisseurs had discovered as early as in Boban's 
attack on cardinal Franjo Kuharic, in which he used a literary 
example from which it follows that the killing of a Turk is not 
a thing for which an honorable man should go to confession. It 
was most probably the conflict with the friars, with Kaptol [the 
Zagreb see], and the Vatican, which can not agree with such 
views, that encouraged many Bosnian Croats from Bosanska 
Posavina, Sarajevo, and central Bosnia to conclude they should 
finally get organized and found associations, assemblies, and 
political bodies that would reject Mate Boban and dispute 
"Herceg-Bosna." 
  The grief-stricken session in Livno, at which even Vice 
Vukojevic [HDZ representative in Croatian Parliament, military 
official in Herceg-Bosna] and Ivan Aralica [Croatian writer, HDZ 
representative in Croatian parliament] had to hear Drazen Budisa 
out [president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party], moved 
between political self-defense and a silent commemoration, and 
one could guess what the matter was about only from between the 
lines. "When a Muslim in Livno or a Serb in Mostar have the same 
rights as the Croats, then Herceg-Bosna will be a truly 
democratic state," said Boban's former protector Gojko Susak 
[Croatian defense minister], while Boban's successor Mile 
Akmadzic gloomily concluded: "The Church is our mother, and a 
mother's hand is the same when it scolds as when it caresses." 
Playing the role of the innocent who does not even know why he 
is being charged, Mate Boban made public the tragic list of 
Croat victims, Croat losses, Croat defeats, and Croat 
misfortunes, and in doing so he never once asked if the policy 
that was befallen by this entire encyclopedia of suffering could 
at all be proclaimed successful and the only possible one. 
  Boban is leaving, but the "Declaration" stays, confirming 
that people are replaceable, but the spirit remains. It 
promises the continuation of the irreconcilable war over Mostar, 
which has been proclaimed "the capital city of a sovereign 
state-forming people" and "an indivisible entity," as if Mostar 
has not become Vukovar already, as if before the war there were 
not Croats, Muslims, and Serbs in the city, as if it had not 
been decided in principle that it should be placed under 
international management, as if the State Department has not 
announced that the "Croat cleansing" of Mostar was what caused 
the Croat-Muslim conflicts. The nontransience of cultural 
monuments was also suddenly discovered, while no one knows if 
the investigation against the "three members of a tank crew" 
that destroyed the Old Bridge has moved from a standstill. 
(Izetbegovic is even shooting his bandits.) The international 
court for war crimes and the protection of humanitarian convoys 
are supported, while no one accepts responsibility for what has 
happened so far. "Everything that happened were only 
consequences," says Boban, "and the consequence is always less 
punishable than the act in the cause." 
  This way of thinking is what has led to his final downfall.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zvonko Lerotic: "Sacrificing the First-Born </F>
in Livno"] 
  [Text] The Livno meeting last week was supposed to be the 
central event for the Croat people at the beginning of this 
year, at which misunderstandings were supposed to have been 
cleared up, pains mitigated, and the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
"ustashas and partisans" reconciled. One of the sides would 
make a sacrifice and renounce its "first-born son," while the 
other would renounce its political strategy of an integral and 
nonunitary Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, any conciliation between 
two fierce opponents can only last a very short time, and as 
soon as the common threats recede, they, by the nature of their 
missions, will start plotting against each other's lives. This 
is why at the Second Congress of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic 
Community] Dr. Tudjman simply had to put in completely different 
people that did not belong to either line. He recently pointed 
out that certain people belonging to the left and right of the 
HDZ hoped that the new inexperienced and plain center would 
fail. He added that it would not and could not fail. The same 
model for nominating the nine-member Presidential Council of the 
republic of Herceg-Bosna was used in resolving the conflict 
within the Croat corps in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Unfortunately, Boban's policies are not going with him. The 
well-informed say that he built his policies on admiring the 
Serbs, especially Karadzic, and belittling the Muslims and 
Izetbegovic. They say that he simply overestimated the Serb 
power, and completely underestimated the Muslim national 
element. He trusted Karadzic too much, almost worshipping him. 
He and Karadzic mutually encouraged their image of the 
state-forming and military incompetence of the Muslims. The 
consequences of this have been more than fatal to Croatia and 
the Croats. To what extent the war conflict between the Croats 
and Muslims arose from the policy of overestimating one side and 
underestimating the other will certainly be a subject of future 
research, but one thing is certain: If Boban had remained leader 
of Herceg-Bosna, NATO would have, after Sarajevo, started 
threatening the Croats because of Mostar. 
  Boban was, with his policies, the symbol of success of the 
Croat-Serb relations, but also a hostage of Karadzic's success. 
Since he could not keep up with him in the military and 
propaganda terms, he had to step aside. Karadzic imposed the 
sanctions on Serbia, and Boban realized that he was going to 
spare Croatia that punishment if he withdraws. The most fatal 
thing for him was overestimating the power of the Herzegovinian 
Croats, and underestimating the power of the Church among the 
Croats. 
  Since Boban has left, it is likely that the relations among 
the Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina will become more balanced, as 
will the relations of the Croats with the Muslims and Serbs. 
The NATO decisions of 9 February will certainly have an impact 
on that. The NATO ultimatum to the Serbs will present Croatia 
with a difficult question: If the West is declaring war on the 
Serbs, can Croatia be left out? The other difficult question 
concerns the new U.S.-French plan, according to which the Serbs 
and Croats should provide about 37 percent of the territory for 
the Muslims. 
  The result of the Bosnia-Herzegovina tragedy is the 
increasing insistence of the western world on the integral and 
internationally recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina. The entire West 
now opposes what VECERNJI LIST presented as the only possible 
Croatian policy. According to the editorial in the 10 February 
issue, this policy consists of the following: "Let us not 
philosophize too much. What is, in a simplified sense, the 
issue? (this concerns the political implication of Dr.Tudjman's 
sentence "Mate [Boban], be as much a person from Zagorje as I am 
a Herzegovinian") On the other hand, Tudjman is offered an 
agreement with Milosevic, who is prepared to renounce his 
proteges in the Croatian UNPA's [UN Protected Areas], but under 
the condition that the accounts be squared in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." It seems that this "squaring of accounts" 
will not be at the Muslim expense, and the issue of the UNPA's 
is raised as independent of the resolution for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Will the Croats continue to die by both 
Serb and Muslim hand? 
  Alain Juppe's visit to Sarajevo and Zagreb was intended to 
persuade the Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina to reach a 
political solution. As far as the Serbs are concerned, they are 
left with ultimatums; "it is a question of dignity and honor," 
said Juppe, threatening the Bosnian Serbs. After all the 
events, Karadzic defends himself with absurdities, showing that 
any rational dialogue with him is impossible. He is a man who 
sees dummies instead of dead people. Any attempt to make an 
arrangement with him is senseless, and at the expense of the one 
who gets involved in a dialogue with him. Those who do not live 
in the damnation of lies should not negotiate with this tyrant. 
In this light, the policy that states that it would negotiate 
with the Satan himself if it is in the interest of Croatia does 
not stand a chance. The issue of Mate Boban crops up here. 
Karadzic could have made, or even indicated, a concession, and 
he would have spared him the resignation. The question is why 
Karadzic wrote Mate Boban off, not having given him a chance of 
political survival.

<F P=106> [Article by Gojko Marinkovic: "Does Mesic Like Skiing?"] </F>
  [Text] No sooner had the fuss abated about GLOBUS releasing 
top secret information on war crimes committed by the so-called 
Mercep's unit than the [Croatian] weekly again came into 
conflict with the ruling Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ]. This 
time it was over the article "Are Stipe Mesic, Josip Manolic, 
and Gojko Susak Leaving Office?," which analyzes the dramatic 
crescendo in the second round of conflicts in the leadership of 
the HDZ. Supporting its story with a top-level source (in the 
previous case the regime's newspapers accused Josip Manolic of 
leaking state secrets), GLOBUS explicitly claims that 20 days 
ago President Tudjman proposed that Mesic, chairman of the 
parliament, resign, which Mesic refused. GLOBUS's source further 
claims that, with regard to Mesic's reluctance to resign, the 
change is not certain for the time being, because the power 
structure in parliament is such that Mesic has the full support 
of HDZ deputies, and most probably among the opposition. 
<H5>  Strategic Differences in Opinions </H5>
  As for Manolic, the chairman of the parliament's Chamber of 
Counties, Tudjman has not yet recommended that he resign, which 
does not mean that such a request might not be made soon. 
Manolic, at one time a very close Tudjman aide and the second 
most powerful man in Croatia, today disagrees with the president 
over the majority of strategic issues. Everything that they 
argued about before the 2d General Convention of the HDZ has 
recently escalated: in the first place on the policy on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the attitude toward that legal state. 
Furthermore, they disagree about the further political 
orientation of the HDZ, as well as about the choice of the 
party's leadership. The depth of that breach is clearly shown 
in an interview with Manolic, where he asks: "And why should 
the HDZ exist at all?" Manolic's view is that the HDZ's work 
is, actually, at an end, that is to say, it took power from the 
communists, but he obviously disagrees that the HDZ should 
remain in power at any price, particularly not by straying into 
a dangerous, right-wing direction, to put it mildly. Similar 
views are also held by Mesic, who at this moment has been pushed 
to the margins, just like the entire parliament after all. 
However, since he, according to the Constitution, potentially 
holds the second most important position in Croatia, because as 
the chairman of parliament he is also the president's deputy, it 
is quite logical for pressures to be put on him to resign, but 
he is also doing everything to avoid that. 
  As for the strongest representative of the right wing, 
Defense Minister Gojko Susak, who is very close to President 
Tudjman, but also has strong connections with Herceg-Bosna, 
actually his real base, he can also no longer boast of Tudjman's 
trust as much as he was able to until recently. There are two 
major charges against him: Susak is reproached for the 
catastrophic situation in Herceg-Bosna, and blamed for the 
tragedy of the Croats in central Bosnia, while he is also 
considered responsible for the underdevelopment of the Croatian 
military-industrial complex. Of course, Susak's name is 
inseparable from Mate Boban, who again failed to appear in 
Geneva, sending Mile Akmadzic as a replacement, who actually 
signed the agreement with [Bosnian Serb] Nikola Koljevic. 
Tudjman had already explained earlier that Boban had not been 
suspended, but the issue has to do with a concession to the 
Muslims, who directly accuse Boban of initiating the 
Croat-Muslim war. 
<H5>  The Time Factor </H5>
  Manolic, who again gave an interview to GLOBUS, says, 
commenting on Tudjman's explanation: "Perhaps that answer may 
satisfy some people, but not necessarily all people." However, 
he has also gone a step further in making accusations at the 
expense of Boban and Susak. He claims that "Boban called on the 
citizens of central Bosnia many times to leave their homes, 
offering them vast and fertile pieces of land on the Adriatic 
coast, in Istria, and on the islands. This was a strategic 
error of Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because the 
Croats were being called on to leave the land where their roots 
are. Such a policy would mean the Serbs crossing the Drina 
River and joining Knin to greater Serbia. The architects of 
Croatian policy in Bosnia, who are largely influenced by 
Herzegovinian reality, are unacceptably sensitive to any 
critical view, still considering their policy to be the best. 
However, the results have invalidated their view and led them 
into ever greater isolation." 
  Manolic disagrees with Susak that Croatia should intervene 
militarily in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because "anybody who makes 
such statements must know what they mean for the Croatian 
state." Manolic does not even try to hide the fact that he is 
in open conflict with the defense minister, but he is uncertain 
what the conclusion will be: Whether one of them will have to 
leave, or if the entire issue will be left to the drift of time. 
However, what he most frequently argues about with his 
opponents, who call him a former agent of UDBA [State Security 
Administration, the former Yugoslav secret police] and a 
communist, is his assessment in one word of the effectiveness of 
the lawful state: Catastrophic! "Murders, violence, evictions, 
frame-ups, smuggling -- all these have become everyday 
occurrences. Still, the worst thing is that a very small number 
of cases are investigated, and a very small number come to 
court. The war explains the increased violence, but 
independently of the war, the authorities must not tolerate 
murder, or let the murderers get away with it." 
  However, that something is going on has been confirmed by an 
article by a minor journalist (Ante Gugo) in SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, 
which should be read only because that newspaper customarily 
expresses the attitudes of the authorities. Which is to say, 
this journalistic apprentice, who became the chief of NEDJELJNA 
DALMACIJA correspondent's bureau overnight, claims that the 
story about Mesic's suspension has been carefully safeguarded, 
and that is only 45 days old. According to Gugo, the removal of 
Vice Vukojevic, "the man who most openly opposed the desired and 
badly needed reconciliation of the Croatian people within 
itself," demanded a sacrifice to be made by the other side as 
well. A scapegoat was found in Mesic, because his open 
confrontation with Tudjman's policy makes his departure even 
less curious, whereas the chances that Manolic will be 
suspended, as well as that Susak's position as defense minister 
will be taken over by Franjo Greguric, are less likely. 
According to this interpretation, Manolic is one of the most 
active cofounders of the party, a relentlessly cunning and lucid 
man, who can be counted upon in critical situations, while 
representing no danger, because he has only a honorary function. 
As for Susak, he is to be given the greatest credit "for the 
implementation of many things in the army and the system of 
defense," and thanks to him, Croatian soldiers "are eating the 
same food as NATO soldiers, and smoking Marlboro cigarettes in 
crush-proof packs." 
<H5>  Disagreements </H5>
  Although it is completely clear that the conflict within the 
HDZ is still not over, and that all the disagreements and 
differences of concepts have only now come to light (it was 
noticed that at the latest session of the Presidential Defense 
Council Manolic, Mesic, and Vrdoljak were all absent, while at 
the same time Ivan Bobetko stated that he would be extending his 
membership in the HDZ, because the stream of former UDBA agents 
had definitely lost the battle; he also said that if they had 
won power, it would have completely ruined Croatia, which it is 
still doing under the wing of Glavas in Osijek), the party's 
Council states that "the misinformation about the rifts in the 
leadership are not true and quite malicious. Furthermore, 
speculation about the suspensions of some top officials, 
particularly Mssrs. Mesic, Manolic, and Susak is also false. It 
is not true that the president of the republic has demanded 
Mesic's resignation, while the only truth is that Mesic is 
having his annual vacation, and he will be staying abroad for a 
while." 
  (By the way, to journalists who asked why Mesic took a 
month's vacation in the middle of winter and on the eve of the 
parliamentary session scheduled for 25 January, Manolic wittily 
answered: "Well, he probably likes skiing!") 
  However, the HDZ Council has not remained on the defensive, 
as it also says that "some moves and demands by some opposition 
parties aimed at causing a constitutional crisis and prompting 
early elections obviously do not contribute to the consolidation 
of internal stability and the international status of Croatia, 
but are quite probably aimed at the destabilization of the 
democratic process. Their goal is to stir up dissatisfaction 
among the people, even social disorder by encouraging strikes, 
and also, as they themselves say, cooperation with a sane part 
of the HDZ, in order to cause a constitutional crisis and a 
change of administration." 

<H5>    Where The Problem Lies </H5>
  And then there comes probably the most significant part of 
the statement, that sounds as if it had been rewritten from not 
so old [Communist] Party documents: "All of this is to be 
viewed in the context of speculations disseminated by the 
opposition and certain foreign circles about the need to find 
acceptable successors to the current leaders in Croatia, as well 
as in other states that came about with the collapse of former 
Yugoslavia." 
  In addition to the fact that it was the first time that the 
HDZ, although indirectly, had defended its greatest enemy, 
namely Milosevic, the further course of events has shown where 
the problem lies. The government has passed the Law on Internal 
Affairs, where one clause says that "the president of the 
Republic of Croatia is the supreme commander of all units of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs." If we connect this with the 
statement made by the Council of the HDZ, and thereafter with 
the statement of Jure Radic, HDZ secretary general and head of 
the Cabinet of the President of the Republic, that "papers have 
already been circulating throughout Croatia for many months, 
which actually come from abroad, containing instructions on how 
to destabilize the authorities," then it is clear that more and 
more arguments are being invented for the current 
semipresidential system, called superpresidential by many 
people, to strengthen itself even further. 
  Under the pretext of conspiracies at home and abroad, 
Tudjman 
is trying to strengthen and legalize his self-governing even 
more, which is made through the ever greater marginalization of 
the parliament, as well as of the HDZ, which has been reduced to 
a bureaucratic apparatus full of anonymous people. It seems 
that Tudjman, as well as Manolic, understand that the HDZ has 
played out its role -- it won the elections and came to power -- 
but since it is gradually turning into something like the former 
Socialist Association, that supports only one policy, it will be 
used merely as a voting machine for as long as possible. The 
question is how long things will work that way, and whether the 
steps like the Geneva agreement with the FRY will help the plan 
or frustrate it. When, and if, it comes to disorder, one knows 
what ought to be done. 
  Of course, there is no chance that early elections might be 
announced, because, according to the opinion polls, a third of 
the population supports early elections. The reason is that, 
although the HDZ still leads with 33.8 percent, with the 
Croatian Social Liberal Party led by Drazen Budisa are at its 
heels with 33.1 percent, in early elections the HDZ could hardly 
win such a large parliamentary majority as it has now. Which is 
to say, all this has to do with the most typical power struggle, 
and now one can see how truthful the statement by one of the 
more prominent HDZ officials was: "Now it is our turn to rule 
for the next 45 years!" Only then might it happen that the 
ruling party changes its name into HDZ -- the Party of 
Democratic Changes.

<F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "NATO and the Serb `Smart' </F>
Destructive Sub-Ammunition"] 
  [Text] The fuss about the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian 
Serbs to withdraw their artillery-missile equipment or place it 
under control did not occur just because of the recent (drastic) 
massacre in Sarajevo. Some time ago UNPROFOR and the NATO 
information services responsible for monitoring the development 
of military technology established that the Serbs had developed 
and started serial production of "shells of the range and 
destructiveness of missiles." 
  What the military magazines of the former JNA [Yugoslav 
People's Army] wrote about in 1990 has become reality. 
Belgrade, which continues to allocate 75 percent of the state 
budget to the army, has sent artillery ammunition of increased 
destructive power not to the testing ranges but directly to the 
real war. The M-65 155-mm caliber Serb howitzers produced under 
U.S. license fire shells that are made of new materials and 
filled with better powders. 
  The Serbs have constructed an artillery shell "with an 
extended range and increased destructive power." Its main 
characteristic is ribbed embossment in the center part (the 
Serbs call them "little ribs"). The "little ribs" prevent 
undesired activity with the extended-length shell. They can 
therefore be fired from common artillery pieces, and there is no 
need to construct special gun and howitzer barrels or to 
refashion existing ones. This means that the Serbs, at the time 
of a difficult economic crisis, have no intention of writing off 
their old artillery technology. Instead of replacing artillery 
pieces, they simply change the ammunition for more modern and 
effective ammunition. 
  For instance, the shells are filled with the so-called 
progressive powder, which can increase velocity by 8 to 12 
percent. During combustion, the progressive powder creates 
constant pressure, which equals the highest pressure allowed. 
Apart from the shells with the "little ribs," the Serbs have 
been doing intensive work on creating 155-mm caliber 
precision-guided missiles (they are also planning production of 
the 203-mm caliber) by adding great precision in hitting very 
small, moving, but significant targets to the existing 
destructive power of the missile. 
<H5>  Doctrine Tested in Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>
  The Serb military doctrine, which is also formed on the 
basis 
of experience at the fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, considers the 
proportion of surface-to-surface missiles of short (tactical) 
range, multiple rocket launchers, and long-range artillery 
simply irreplaceable in the fighting against the opponent 
echelons and in blocking city areas. The Serbs intend to change 
the non-nuclear (common) warhead of the Luna surface-to-surface 
missile into a cluster warhead with 830 bombs that are extremely 
effective against low-resistance targets, such as missile 
systems in position, radars, trucks, and all kinds of towed 
artillery. However, the warhead cannot be used effectively to 
destroy better protected armored vehicles, especially tanks with 
active and reactive armor. 
  The 262-mm caliber Serb Orkan multiple rocket launcher has 
similar effects; the Orkan's 12 truck-mounted barrels launch 
missiles whose warheads have various kinds of subammunition. 
The 12-missile salvo of the Orkan warhead covers the target 
with 7,728 pellets (bombs), which have a destructive effect on 
exposed infantry (as well as civilian population), 
low-resistance technology and other low-resistance targets 
(trucks, classical artillery, [samohotke] with thin armors). As 
a rule, tanks survive Orkan missile strikes. 
  The Serbs have thus developed two additional items that they 
have been testing in Bosnia-Herzegovina (Sarajevo): 
precision-guided warheads and sensor-initiated self-guided 
(antitank) ammunition. The first group consists of cluster-type 
missile warheads with subammunition where the warhead is guided 
to the target area, and after it "recognizes" the target, it 
lowers the subammunition that guides itself to tanks and hits 
them from above. That kind of filling has a cluster effect, 
which pierces the armor, but so does the explosive-formed bullet 
that is very close to the armor it pierces with its kinetic 
energy. These weapons belong to the intelligent or smart 
systems, and the important feature of them is that they consist 
of microelectronic devices containing memory that should enable 
them to distinguish between real and false targets. The cluster 
warhead, launched by the missile, transfers from the ballistic 
path to the planned one, and, under a very gentle angle, reaches 
the target. The memory device recognizes targets, at which it 
throws 16 to 24 self-guided bullets. 
<H5>  Destructive Smart Subammunition </H5>
  The microprocessor memory device distinguishes real from 
false targets on the basis of an infrared image of the target. 
The sensor-initiated artillery ammunition can also destroy 
tanks. This is where 155- and 203-mm caliber artillery shells 
are used. At a certain point in the trajectory, their bottom is 
kicked out and the subammunition comes out of the missile body 
(the 155-mm shell contains two, and the 203-mm three pieces of 
such subammunition), which descends to the zone of marked 
targets by parachute, where, with its sensor device, it locates 
a particular target, and then the explosion creates a 
drop-shaped missile that destroys the tank by hitting the roof 
part of the armor, its thinnest part. 
  This subammunition has multispectral sensors (infrared, 
radar, and radiometric), which are active while they descend to 
the target by parachute. After the opening of the brake 
parachute, a gentle rotation of sensor devices starts in the 
searching phase, with a vertical descent velocity of 10 meters 
per second. When it fixes on the target, the device uses the 
memory to analyze it, combining sensor signals and determining 
the optimal time for activating the explosive filling, which 
shapes the drop-shaped body for piercing the armor. Detonation 
occurs at a distance of 150 meters from the tank. 

<H5>    Three Applications </H5>
  With their new technology and enhanced accuracy, the Serbs 
want to destroy the rapidly increased power of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. This mainly applies to: guided 
missiles, command positions, and radio-electronic systems. They 
also want to neutralize Muslim guns, howitzers, mortars, and 
antiattack batteries. The new "smart" subammunition will serve 
to protect flanks, interspaces, and engineering obstacles; it 
will be used for preparation and counterpreparation, and for 
neutralizing and decimating the Muslim units in the gathering 
zones, during the time of approaching the front end of the 
opponent's defense or on the line of development for attack. 
There is also the destruction of tanks and infantry wedged into 
the Serb defense, as well as support for the counterattacks and 
counterstrikes of other echelons and reserves. 
  The ultimate scope of this undoubtedly important effort in 
employing the "remodeled" and reinforced missile-artillery 
potential of the Serb army in Bosnia-Herzegovina embraces the 
three applications of the armed forces: 
  -- Regrouping, which means that hostilities of medium and 
high intensity have broken out, and it is necessary to prevail 
by maneuvering and having great arms power (precisely aimed); 
  -- Anticipation, which means maneuvering to prevent an 
outbreak of hostilities, by developing all the available 
"precision-guided ammunition"; 
  -- Deterrence, which means making the enemy (without 
starting 
one's own forces from their stationary positions) refrain from 
any war activities or combat activities of great intensity, as 
they would be destroyed by the Serb artillery-missile equipment. 
  The ultimatum to the Serbs can therefore be viewed as having 
several levels. By claiming to protect the Muslims, NATO is 
actually thinking of its own skin -- and armor.

<F P=106> [Article by Filip Svarm: "The Return of the District Chief"] </F>
  [Text] Mile Martic has finally become president of Krajina 
on his second, makeup, attempt. Otherwise, they would have voted 
again and a third, fourth, or fifth time, as many times as it 
took. That is why there have been no objections to the conduct 
and regularity of the elections. There have, however, been 
congratulations: Dr. Radovan Karadzic and Nikola Sainovic, M.A., 
have congratulated Martic on his election victory. 
Representatives of the pan-Serb interests of Slobodan Milosevic 
who have been campaigning with so much fervor at village 
meetings and over Radio-TV Serbia in favor of the Krajina police 
minister can now go off for a well-deserved rest. That means 
that Mihajlo Markovic, member of the academy, no longer has to 
wander around Banija, Brana Crncevic and Minister Zoran Bingulac 
do not have to freeze in Baranja, and Radmila Milentijevic does 
not have to explain to Krsto Bijelic why Milan Babic must not 
win. It probably was also a relief both to Dr. Franjo Tudjman 
and to the doves in Krajina. 
<H5>  A Miracle in Krajina </H5>
  In the first round of the Krajina presidential elections, 
held 12 December 1993, Mile Martic received 60,000 votes less 
than Milan Babic. But all those--and there were many--who saw 
that as Slobodan Milosevic's defeat in any election proved to be 
very wrong. The Election Commission of the RSK [Serbian Republic 
Krajina], after an objection from Martic's headquarters, first 
nullified the elections in Knin and Benkovac Opcinas, and then 
in six other electoral units. Then, when they were repeated on 
26 December, it found about 4,000 invalid ballots, so that Babic 
received precisely 49.27 percent of the vote and did not become 
president. 
  Simultaneously with the official proclamation of the results 
of the first round of the elections, the Election Commission 
postponed the second round from 13 to 23 January 1994 without 
providing any coherent explanation. It was felt, that is, that 
it would take that long for the strategists in Belgrade to work 
out a new strategy. That is, it had turned out that pushing 
Martic beyond any limit of good taste and the failure to mention 
his opponent even in a single word over Radio-TV Serbia had not 
borne fruit. The interior minister had concerned himself with 
idle Serbianizing and commonplaces, which had departed greatly 
from everyday life in Krajina, and therefore did not interest 
very many people. The decision was made, then, to sling mud at 
Babic and to frighten the Krajina population into thinking that 
they would be left to their fate and to the Croats should he be 
victorious. 
  Martic himself began it. He accused his rival of intending 
to 
take power with a hullabaloo in the media and said that he was 
not interested in anything else. He said all that could cause a 
situation in Krajina similar to the one in Cazin Krajina, and 
that he, disappointed with the methods used by Babic and his 
people, would withdraw from the election race unless there were 
changes in the makeup of election commissions and voter 
committees. The message could not have been stated more 
clearly--unless Martic's ultimatums are accepted, the elections 
and the transfer of power become uncertain, and a coup d'etat 
was certain. If Babic wanted to preserve anything of what he had 
achieved in the first round, he had to accept that offer. The 
impression that Serbia would give up on Krajina unless its 
president was satisfied with the outcome of the elections there 
was also intensified by some of the correspondents representing 
the government media in Knin. They accused Babic's people of 
crimes, separatism aimed against the Srpska republic (joining 
Krajina and the Banjaluka region), of treason to the 
nationality, of being close to the opposition in Serbia, and so 
on. As to how much effect it had, there is a story going around 
that Lazar Macura, who, it was thought, would become Babic's 
prime minister, felt it on his own skin. On one occasion, he 
declared over TV Knin that Dr. Karadzic was traveling around 
Krajina and campaigning for Martic and that "as a foreign 
national, he ought not to be allowed to do that." After that, 
Macura allegedly got on a bus to go from Knin to Belgrade. The 
police of the Srpska republic, when they were checking the 
identity cards of the passengers, asked him for his passport. 
When he said he did not have one, he was taken off the bus as a 
"foreign national." He tried to hitchhike back to Knin, but Dr. 
Karadzic's zealous police forbid drivers to let him in. He was 
allowed to call for a car to come for him from Knin only after 
he had waited around the whole night near the checkpoint. 
  Nevertheless, Krajina felt what media pressure means when at 
the beginning of the year Martic's special police occupied all 
the TV transmitters and thus prevented operation of TV Knin, 
which was inclined toward Babic. At the same time, Serbian 
Radio-TV of Krajina, a government institution, was opened in 
Plitvice. Relying on tested personnel and equipment from TV Novi 
Sad, this television station mainly concerned itself with 
various Martic campaign rallies and press releases and passing 
on everything that Martic's sponsors had to say about Babic in 
Belgrade. The journalist Petko Koprivica (TV Novi Sad) won 
particular fame with his statement that "Babic wants unification 
of Serbian lands, but according to the lights of Vuk Draskovic, 
Vesna Pesic, and Ivan Djuric." There is no need to spell out 
that those who were attacked never had the occasion to respond 
to that propaganda. 
  Martic's key statement was that he would like best to be 
president of Krajina only five days and then turn over the 
office to "Milosevic, president of all the Serbs." A sizable 
portion of Krajina citizens interpreted it this way: Who knows 
what might happen if Babic returns. The belief that a conflict 
with Serbia must not be risked at any price seems to have 
prevailed, and thus a miracle occurred in Krajina--Martic's 
victory in the second round. 
<H5>  The Day After </H5>
  There are also explanations to the effect that Babic was 
simply told that Belgrade would never accept him as president of 
Krajina and that he must in the end reconcile himself to his 
loser's fate. Nevertheless, on the day after the elections 
Martic is not entirely in the saddle either. Babic's Serbian 
Democratic Party [SDS] of Krajina has a majority (30 deputies) 
in the RSK parliament. Together with the Radicals, who number 
16, possibly reinforced by some of the eight independent 
deputies, he is in a position to bring down any candidate for 
prime minister Matic proposes. Accordingly, it is possible that 
the post of RSK prime minister will be offered to the former 
president of Knin Opcina. There are, of course, two conditions: 
the first is that Babic "get on the right track," and second 
that the Radicals support him. The first is not very likely, and 
as matters stand the Krajina Radicals are threatened with a 
split. That is, a large number of them never supported Dr. 
Vojislav Seselj in his attacks on Slobodan Milosevic during the 
Serbian parliamentary election. 
  The names of Djordje Begovic and Boro Mikelic have been 
circulating as possible future prime ministers. The former has 
not stood out particularly as prime minister up to now, nor has 
anyone particularly reproached him in the showdowns between 
Krajina leaders. He is well-known as a neutral figure far 
readier to carry out orders than to shape policy. Boro Mikelic 
is much more interesting in this case. He emerged in Petrinja 
only when Abdic's Western Bosnia Autonomous Province, or rather 
its supply corridor through Banija, began to function. Babo from 
Velika Kladusa has worked out very elaborate trade with the 
Serbs, so that there are grounds for the assumption that 
Mikelic, who has been a businessman for many years, has found 
business interests. He was also one of Martic's propagandists, 
and the latter has often mentioned him as a patriot to be awed. 
If things are looked at through the declared intentions of 
Belgrade and Zagreb to normalize relations, one of the bridges 
to moderating tensions with Krajina might in any case be Mikelic 
after the pattern of Abdic. But Martic and Mikelic would be the 
last to make decisions about that. 
<H5>  The Future </H5>
  The joint statement of the Republic of Croatia and the FRY 
cast great doubt on Martic's election campaign promises of an 
imminent union. Dr. Karadzic's statement that a unified Serbia 
must first reach the Una and only afterward the Kupa was also a 
cold shower. Although the interpretations of Belgrade and Pale 
that this does not signify renunciation of the proclaimed 
concept of all Serbs in one state, Krajina political life is 
moving more and more toward apathy. It has become evident that 
people are tired out by the elections, all the politicking, and 
television. Martic's first statement as president after the 
elections fitted well into the mindset that Krajina is the last 
to make decisions about its destiny. He said over Radio-TV 
Serbia that he would gather around him a team of intelligent and 
able people from all the Serbian lands--that is, both from 
Serbia and from the Srpska republic. When we recall that his 
election promises included a strengthening of the police, it is 
certain that a paramount objective of his authority will be to 
guarantee that orders from Belgrade are carried out. This is 
especially important, because power at the opcina level has 
mainly been taken over by Babic's Serbian Democratic Party of 
Krajina. Likewise, various emissaries from the Srpska republic 
are traveling around Krajina and making offers to people who 
might want to move into abandoned Muslim and Croatian houses 
there on a turnkey basis. For example, Prijedor and Derventa 
have been envisaged for people from Plaski. 
  Finally, what else is one to conclude but that the process 
of 
a big trade of Krajina has gone pretty far. Martic's job is only 
to make that as painless as possible--regardless of whether he 
personally is aware of the role intended for him.

First Round of the Presidential Elections in the RSK 

Registered voters                      289,866 

Voters voting                          236,300 

Votes for Milan Babic                  116,014 

Votes for Milan Martic                 50,000[.sup]1[/] 

Other presidential candidates          70,000[.sup]1[/] 

Second Round of the Presidential Elections in the RSK 

Registered voters                      295,611 

Voters voting                          207,550 

Votes for Milan Babic                  97,377 

Votes for Milan Martic                 104,234 

[.sup]1[/]The figures from other sources fluctuate by approximately 1,000 
votes. 


  The size of the turnout in the second round of the Krajina 
presidential elections was 28,750 smaller than in the first 
round. Because it is usual for people to abstain in a runoff, we 
can assume that it did not affect the final score--especially 
because Martic was about 60,000 votes short of Babic in the 
first round. It is of interest, however, that the number of 
registered voters increased. Their number was 5,745 greater in 
the second round. The assumption that in the interval between 
the two rounds that number of citizens of Krajina came of age 
and that the mortality rate was minimal is not realistic. The 
matter is still more interesting when we find that in the second 
round Martic had 6,857 votes more than Babic. The inevitable 
conclusion is that the Krajina interior minister was given the 
necessary number of "dead souls" (inhabitants of Krajina who 
have moved away) necessary for victory. When we realize that the 
local election commissions and committees were changed to meet 
Martic's wishes after his defeat in the first round of the 
elections, this was no problem whatsoever.

  [Text] (HTV) -- Croatian Radio-Television Journal comments 
on the proposal to appoint Veljko Knezevic the head of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] Government Office in 
Zagreb: 
  ``Yesterday's news that Veljko Knezevic, former Zagreb 
Radio-Television director, well-known albeit not held in good 
repute, was proposed to be the head of the FRY Government Office 
in Zagreb has spurred much comment and naturally posed some 
questions. 
  ``The Belgrade Government has the right to propose its 
representative in Zagreb; however, Croatia has the right to 
accept or reject this appointment. If Knezevic's arrival means 
that Belgrade wants to speed up the normalization of relations 
and assure Knin's consent to its inclusion in the 
constitutional-legal system of the Republic of Croatia with the 
help of a man born in Knin, then it is expected that Zagreb will 
accept this proposal. If, however, this appointment is intended 
as a provocation, which cannot be excluded by any means, then 
Croatia should not accept such a choice because it would 
certainly not lead to a normalization of relations, which, we 
repeat, is not only in the interest of Croatia, but should be 
even more in the interest of Belgrade. 
  ``One may ask: What is the meaning of Knezevic's agreement 
to 
being appointed the Yugoslav representative in Zagreb. A logical 
answer is that he has recognized the Republic of Croatia and 
therefore would work towards the normalization of relations as 
soon as possible. 
  "Of course, all this is pure speculation about what is 
possible, but we will not need to wait long for the answers."

  [Text] The SSH [Socialist Party of Croatia] leadership 
distributed the following public statement at a news conference: 
  1) The Republic of Croatia must immediately and clearly, 
without any reservations, declare its support for a unified 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which should not be divided on an ethnic 
basis. 
  2) The Republic of Croatia must make a clear and unambiguous 
statement that it will strive to protect, with all means except 
military ones, those elements of the Croatian nation who live 
outside the republic's borders. 
  3) The Croatian people -- a substantial part of whom gave 
their votes of confidence to the HDZ [Croatian Democratic 
Community] at the last elections -- did not vote for a policy of 
war and military engagement in other countries. They must be 
informed of all the relevant factors that have led to the 
growing international isolation of Croatia and the threat of 
international sanctions. 
  4) The introduction of sanctions against Croatia would be 
counterproductive, as confirmed by the case of Serbia, and they 
must be avoided in the interest of the majority of the 
population which would be hardest hit.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Staying the Course"] </F>
  [Text] In typical FERAL TRIBUNE style, mixing seriousness 
with satire, reporter Marinko Culic examines Croatian foreign 
policy and the threat of possible international economic 
sanctions in the latest issue of this Split weekly. Despite the 
possibility that Croatia will soon "sail" into international 
sanctions, the "ship" of state does not show any visible signs 
that something serious is happening. The course remains the 
same. One hears an angry but inconsequential foreign policy 
debate carried on by the opposition. According to FERAL TRIBUNE, 
for a short while the opposition even succeeded in convincing a 
part of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] that 
Croatian foreign policy was misdirected. However, both soon grew 
silent as if they were afraid of their combined strength. 
  A possible introduction of sanctions against Croatia 
certainly would not be enough to shake the image of the 
president who takes credit for everything in the country. 
However, the sanctions could probably cause suspicion and 
mistrust and lead to uncertainty as to what to expect next. 
  Enumerating these factors, Marinko Culic concludes that the 
next moves by President Tudjman will be interesting, especially 
with regard to his relations with that wing of HDZ which wants 
the international sanctions -- as the best environment for 
creating the Croatia it wishes for.

<F P=106> [Article by Vesna Roller: "Right To Have a Conscience"] </F>
  [Text] Fewer than 1,000 military conscripts took advantage 
of the possibility of resorting to the right to be a 
conscientious objector, i.e., they asked to perform their 
military service without weapons. More that 200 but fewer than 
1,000 conscientious-objector applications have been received at 
the Commission for Civilian Service, which was founded less than 
two years ago at the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of 
Croatia, the commission's president Dr. Ladislav Krapac says. 
  What does the law say? The right to be a conscientious 
objector, which the Yugoslav legislation did not respect, is 
guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia. It 
was adopted at the end of 1990, and later worked out by the law 
on defense. Its regulations set the procedure for implementing 
the right to be a conscientious objector and for informing each 
recruit of his right to be a conscientious objector. In the 
original version of the law, only new recruits could use the 
right to be conscientious objectors, while other conscripts had 
a deadline of three months during which they could submit the 
conscientious objector application. In May 1993, thanks mostly 
to the antiwar activities in Croatia, an amendment to the law on 
defense was passed, whereby a one-year deadline--until the end 
of May 1994--was given to all the conscripts during which they 
could use the right to be conscientious objectors. 
  The Croatian peace activists believe that, although Croatia, 
in contrast to other states on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia, made a great step toward the Western-style of 
democracy by accepting the right to be a conscientious objector, 
its actual implementations has nevertheless significant 
shortcomings. "We still do not have an alternative service, but 
what is involved is military service which is performed without 
weapons," Srdjan Dvornik, an activist of the Antiwar Campaign of 
Croatia, claims. Such a formulation was specified in the 
law--one of its regulations states that civilian service is to 
be performed within the Croatian Army but without carrying 
weapons. Dvornik explains that this definition is contrary to 
the Constitution of Croatia, which acknowledges the right to be 
conscientious objector to military service, but not to carry 
weapons. Only military duties can be carried on in the army, 
Dvornik concludes, and so, according to international law, 
civilians who actively help the army are also considered as 
legitimate targets for attack in a war. 
  The peace activists believe that this discrepancy between 
the 
Constitution and the law should be resolved, and what is more 
important, those who resort to the right to be conscientious 
objectors should be enabled to perform their service outside of 
the army, in a real civilian service. Therefore, they propose 
that alternative military service be organized by another 
government body instead of the Ministry of Defense. The peace 
activists also demand that military service for persons who 
submitted the conscientious objector application be suspended 
during the procedure for its resolution, which is usually three 
months. 
  One of the basic objections to the decree regarding the 
right 
to be a conscientious objector, which the peace activists 
pointed out from the very moment when the law on defense was 
passed, concerns the regulation which stipulates that the 
applicant must explain, i.e., make a convincing case for, 
religious, moral, and other principles for which he refuses to 
perform military service. "The right to be a conscientious 
objector is a matter of a personal decision and no commission 
can decide on its validity," Srdjan Dvornik says, adding that, 
in most Western countries, conscientious objector status is 
automatically approved with the verification of the basic facts 
stated in the request. 
<H5>  Abuses </H5>
  The top leadership in the Ministry of Defense, on the other 
hand, believes that the civilian service is not a universal 
citizen's right: "We must protect ourselves from the abuse of 
the right of civilian military service. Every country has a 
protective filter. Military service is a duty and a right--one 
has to defend the country in which one lives," Stjepan Adanic, 
deputy defense minister for the civilian sector, says. Adanic 
believes that the only person who could be granted the right to 
perform civilian military service is someone who could prove 
that even before being drafted for military service or mobilized 
he had convictions against use of weapons. According to the 
same logic, Adanic explains, atheists, in his opinion, should 
not have the right to be conscientious objectors. 
  The supporters of the right to be a conscientious objector 
as 
a basic citizen's right and representatives of the Croatian 
government do not agree on another issue--whether the argument 
for abstaining from performing military service expounded by 
Croatian citizens of Serb nationality can be accepted as 
valid--the argument that they do not wish to shoot at their own 
people who are "on the other side." Dr. Ladislav Krapac, 
president of the Commission for Civilian Service, claims that 
such "political-ethnic" criteria are unacceptable anywhere in 
Europe. Miso Bozic, attorney and activist of the citizens' 
council for human rights from Karlovac states that a great 
number of Serbs from Karlovac turned to him with the request to 
use their right to be conscientious objectors because they did 
not want to shoot at their relatives, who live on the other side 
of the front line in the immediate vicinity of Karlovac. These 
arguments can be considered as moral reasons, Bozic says, adding 
that political convictions of peace activists can also be 
categorized as moral reasons for not aggreeing to peform 
military service. Ratko Dojcinovic, a member of the citizens' 
council of human rights in Karlovac, based on his personal 
experience, claims that persons who submit conscientious 
objector applications, undergo a special army procedure in which 
the officers try to convince them--by hook or by crook-- to 
change their decision. Thus, Dojcinovic spent 45 days in prison, 
was mistreated and insulted, just so that, as he says, he would 
change his mind and take a gun in his hand. "At the end they 
beat me up and sent me to do heavy physical work," Dojcinovic 
says, and claims that his was not an isolated case. A special 
work brigade--White Tigers--was also organized in Karlovac in 
which only Serbs who refused to carry weapons were mobilized. 
Its members wear white boots and thus, Dojcinovic says, 
everyone can immediately recognize them and "classify" them. 
"Tigers," he claims, "are sent to the front lines in order to 
dig the trenches, all the while being exposed to insults from 
`real' soldiers who consider them as traitors. Croats who 
refuse to carry weapons are also subject to pressures in the 
army." 
<H5>  Political Pressure </H5>
  Zoran Pusic, president of the Civilian Council of Human 
Rights claims that the Ministry of Defense also applies 
systematic methods toward the citizens of the Serbian 
nationality who resort to the right to be conscientious 
objectors. "These people feel that this is a type of ethnic 
cleansing," Pusic says, and claims that a significant number of 
such persons, although they submitted their request to be 
conscientious objectors, ended up in military court. Pusic 
believes that similar methods are also used for political 
pressure. In Karlovac, Pusic illustrates, out of 31 city 
councilmen, only those who are members of the Social-Democratic 
Union receive the call to mobilization. It is logical to expect 
that the right to be a conscientious objector would reduce the 
number of deserters. Their exact number from the begining of the 
war has never been revealed to the Croatian public. Mirsad 
Baksic, state military prosecutor, answering a journalist's 
question on the number of cases of desertion proceedings before 
the military court, says that "there are quite a few." He adds 
that only a few sentences have been pronounced, mostly because 
it is a very long process. It seems that the number of 
deserters in Croatia could increase following the recent mass 
mobilizations whose goal was to reinforce the brigades which 
were sent to the battlefield in Bosnia-Herzegovina. More than 
2,000 persons--mostly Croatian citizens from Bosnia-Herzegovina 
were mobilized at the end of last year and sent to the Bosnian 
front, as reported by the Croatian Helsinki Human Rights Council 
and unsuccesfully denied by the Croatian Defense Ministry. As 
the stories of two young men published in the foreign press 
attest, they were asked in the Zagreb barracks to sign a 
statement that they are voluntarily leaving for Bosnia. The two 
young men, who are students in Zagreb and who succeeded in 
fleeing from the buses on the way to the battlefield in the 
neighboring state, say that even those who refused to sign were 
taken in the end to Bosnia. They are hiding at the moment and 
are pondering whether to turn to the Croatian government to ask 
for the protection of their right not to fight on the territory 
of another state.

<F P=106> [Article by Sa. Paparella: "INA Is Building in Vladivostok"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb--At a ceremony held on Monday [31 January] in 
the offices of the INA enterprise, Franjo Greguric, general 
director of the company, signed a $130-million agreement with 
Nikolaj M. Shubenichev, general director of the Far Eastern 
Petroleum Company of Vladivostok, on the construction of berths 
for tankers at Kamchatka and facilities at the oil pipeline 
terminal for loading oil into the tankers. 
  The "turnkey" agreement calls for the construction of an 
ecologically acceptable terminal with a total annual loading 
capacity of 4.2 million metric tons of oil derivatives with an 
accompanying reservoir area of 300,000 cubic meters over a 
period of 30 months. INA is responsible for the organization and 
the oversight of the work, and Montmontaza of Zagreb, tasked 
with carrying out projects in which over 500 workers will 
participate, is the most important of numerous Croatian 
subcontractors. The signing of the contract was a great success 
because of strong international competition. INA won the 
contract on the basis of the good quality of the projects it has 
carried out in Russia to date.

<F P=106> [Article by Sophia Coudenhove: "Visegrad Countries Make </F>
Small NATO Gain"] 
  [Text] Central European leaders got both more than they 
expected and less than they wanted when Bill Clinton offered 
them the Partnership for Peace initiative. 
  Despite concerted efforts to present a unified front as 
international television networks battled for the best shots, it 
was clear that the region's countries are still reluctant to 
stand together. 
  The leaders of the Visegrad four--the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Hungary and Poland--were pleasantly surprised by the 
results of the Jan. 10-11 NATO summit in Brussels. At the 
summit, members redefined the Partnership for Peace, conceived 
last October by NATO defense ministers as a way to foster ties 
between Central and Eastern Europe and the alliance. NATO 
announced plans for joint training and holding military 
exercises on the territory of Central European states as a 
prelude to eventual NATO membership. 
  "President Clinton's visit undoubtedly dispelled fears that 
had arisen here and in some of our neighboring countries that 
[the Partnership for Peace] is like a pacifier or an excuse or 
something just intended to calm us down," said Czech Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec. 
  The presidents of the Visegrad countries all provisionally 
accepted the initiative, which is considered a first step 
towards--though not a promise of--NATO membership. 
  "Our countries have very similar views on the Partnership 
for 
Peace," said Czech president Vaclav Havel. "I would be happy if 
today the city of Prague could emerge as a symbol of Europe 
standing in alliance." 
  While the leaders agreed that they all wanted eventual NATO 
membership, they differed on how strongly they pressed for 
specifics. The partnership plan contains no security guarantees 
and no timetable for NATO membership. 
  While Hungarian president Arpad Goncz called Jan. 12 "a 
historic day," the Polish delegation was much less enthusiastic. 
  "We have plenty of promises and political statements but we 
lack specific perspectives," said Polish Foreign Minister 
Andrzej Olechowski. According to Polish representatives, the 
initiative is a step in the right direction, but a step that is 
too small. 
  Meanwhile, Polish President Lech Walesa, who had threatened 
to boycott the talks unless the Partnership for Peace was 
defined to his satisfaction in Brussels, refused to take part in 
any of the press conferences following the talks. 
  Prior to the meetings, he said he expected talks with 
Clinton 
to be difficult. 
  Less concerned with guarantees or speed than its neighbors, 
Slovak representatives were happy to be included in the talks at 
all. At the NATO summit, British Prime Minister John Major had 
omitted Slovakia altogether when naming countries most likely to 
join NATO in the near future. 
  The Slovak delegation in Prague stressed that even though 
Slovakia had not advanced economically as far as its neighbors, 
it was still just as interested in the plan. 
  "Different economic conditions among the different countries 
should not be a reason for being included in the Partnership for 
Peace or not," said President Michal Kovac. 
  As Clinton stressed that all four countries would be 
considered individually rather than collectively in the 
Partnership for Peace, Central European leaders settled their 
differences over whether talks with President Clinton should 
have been bilateral or multilateral. 
  President Havel underscored the need for regional 
cooperation, even though the Czech Republic had been the only 
Visegrad member to press for bilateral, rather than multilateral 
talks. 
  "Good relations with our neighbors are in the fundamental 
interest of each of our countries as well as in the fundamental 
interest of Europe as a whole," he said. 
  On that front, Havel confirmed that the presidents of the 
Visegrad countries plus Germany, Austria and Slovenia will meet 
in April at Litomysl, east Bohemia, the birthplace of Czech 
composer Bedrich Smetana. Havel said the event will be cultural 
and no pacts, treaties or declarations will be issued. 
  In his weekly radio broadcast, Havel said Czechs should 
avoid 
expressions of "Czechocentrism" or "provincial mistrust" towards 
the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Marie Koenigova and Katerina Perknerova: "Only </F>
Czech Citizens Can Conduct Business in Weapons"] 
  [Text] According to the law approved by parliament, only 
legal persons resident in the Czech Republic whose capital is 
more than 50 percent domestic can conduct business in military 
materials after 1 April. Two licenses will be necessary -- one 
for business activity and the other for each separate 
transaction. 
  They will be issued by the Trade and Industry Ministry with 
the agreement of the Defense, Foreign, and Interior Ministries 
only if the members of the company's statutory body and its 
authorized officers are Czech Republic citizens over the age of 
21 who have a clean record and were never employed by or 
collaborated with the former State Security. 
  The law stipulates that the license application must 
contain, 
among other things, "the reason for the import or export or -- 
as the case may be -- other handling of the military material" 
and the "name and address of the end-user." The application 
must be accompanied by a "document on its final utilization." 
In reply to a question from RUDE PRAVO on whether the licensing 
procedure for specific transactions will also include 
verification of the foreign trade partner to prevent the 
possible re-export of weapons from the Czech Republic to areas 
of conflict, O. Vychodil (Civic Democratic Party), the 
parliamentary rapporteur on the law, said: "Consideration will 
be given, from the foreign policy point of view, to whether the 
region for which the weapons are destined is or is not a crisis 
region. For this reason, the Foreign, Defense, and Interior 
Ministries will also express their opinion on the application 
for a license for this kind of business. Cooperation with the 
information and intelligence services is also envisaged." 
According to Vychodil, the bodies that grant the license will be 
responsible for safeguarding the Czech Republic's interests. 
"If a deal goes through and the weapons are re-exported because 
the entity has not been verified, this may cause foreign policy 
problems," said Vychodil to RUDE PRAVO. 
  Large and small-caliber weapons, ammunition, bombs, 
torpedoes, shells, mines, military explosives, aircraft, 
helicopters, aircraft engines, aircraft equipment and the ground 
equipment associated with it, missiles, and warships are 
considered to be military materials. The law states 
unequivocally that weapons of mass destruction must not be 
included in this kind of business. If the law is infringed and 
the Czech Republic's vital interests are harmed by the deal, a 
fine of up to 30 million korunas may be imposed. The specific 
individual involved may also face up to 10 years imprisonment. 
A fine of up to 5 million korunas may be imposed for a 
commonplace infringement of the law. 
  RDP Group Director General J. Vlcek described the approved 
law on the export of military materials as a good norm that has 
created the demarcation desired by weapons exporters. The RDP 
Group affiliates 40 Czech enterprises that produce military 
materials. In Vlcek's opinion, it is fitting that the 
appropriate ministries will make the decision on the permits and 
licenses so that possible scandals -- caused, for example, by 
competition -- will not be laid at the door of those who hold 
permits and licenses to conduct business in weapons. In reply 
to a question from RUDE PRAVO on whether the exporter -- who has 
to submit a document on the final utilization of the military 
material, including the name and address of the end- user -- is 
capable of guaranteeing that the weapons will not be 
re-exported, Vlcek said: "No. In my opinion, the Trade and 
Industry Ministry must verify this. After consulting the 
Foreign Ministry and other departments, it must determine 
whether the end-user put forward by us is the right one and 
whether, in his case, there is any risk of re-export to 
so-called crisis countries and regions." 
  The law contains a strict control mechanism. For example, 
staff from the Trade and Industry Ministry have the right to 
demand from the exporter the appropriate documents, agreements, 
and notification about using the licenses at any time. In reply 
to a question on whether this may be abused for competitive 
reasons and whether it could slow down the deals already 
underway, Vlcek said that he has spoken to Minister Dlouhy about 
this. "The question for us is to make sure that the officials 
execute the authority accorded to them by law, but in no way 
exploit it or hold things up artificially," said Vlcek. 
  According to him, detailed directives dealing with this 
issue 
-- and also, for example, permitting publicity for the 
production and export of military materials -- will be adopted 
soon. As he said, supplementary norms should deal with these 
issues, "but, definitely so that the law really creates 
conditions that do not hold back so-called clean trade, 
conditions that do not activate unnecessary barriers."

<F P=106> [Article by Brendan McNally: "Local Fruit Trader Sets Sights </F>
High With Offer for Czech Aircraft Giant"] 
  [Text] A businessman who has found success selling fruit 
and vegetables in Russia says he wants to save the Czech 
aviation industry by buying it lock, stock and barrel. 
  Frantisek Houska, owner and general director of the FrutOvo 
produce company, is offering to buy out Aero, the crisis-ridden 
company that controls nearly all of the Czech aircraft industry, 
for $600 million U.S. in order "to keep it together." 
  Houska claims to have assembled a team of industry experts 
who he says can help put Aero back on its feet. What he wants is 
for the government and Investicni banka, the company's largest 
creditor, to freeze the sale of Aero's assets and daughter 
companies for six months. Houska believes he can get the 
financing to purchase the company put together by June. 
  Houska's offer comes at a time when the Czech Privatization 
Ministry is saying that Aero should be put into receivership, 
given that it owes at least 1.7 billion Kc [Czech korunas] ($51 
million) to Investicni banka. 
  For the past several weeks, Investicni has been threatening 
to force Aero into bankruptcy, following a decision by the 
National Property Fund that overturned the bank's acquisition of 
a 30 percent share in Aero through a debt-equity swap. 
  Aero spokesman Zdenek Burian would give no comment on 
FrutOvo's bid. He said negotiations are continuing between Aero 
and Investicni banka, which is calling for an immediate 
settlement of debts. 
  Houska says the Czech aviation industry is being gutted by 
its management, which is selling off assets and funneling the 
money into its own pockets or paying off bills to the banks. As 
a result, Houska charges, those in management are only 
interested in selling airplanes if it means profit for 
themselves. 
  "What is going on right now is not good," Houska says. "It 
would be a terrible thing if the Czech aviation industry were 
destroyed. It will affect the entire nation and all of Czech 
industry." 
  FrutOvo is a Prague-based company that, since being founded 
in 1988, has reportedly made millions of dollars selling fruit 
and vegetables in the former Soviet Union. FrutOvo now owns 29 
companies, including a grocery chain and a parts importing house 
for Russian Lada automobiles. 
  It briefly attracted media attention last September when 
Investicni banka listed it as one of two companies interested in 
buying the Prague-based engine manufacturer Motorlet, one of 
four Aero subsidiaries the bank had sent to the auction block. 
  FrutOvo's only competitor at the time was the Canadian 
aircraft engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney. Critics of the firm 
charge that it wants to buy Motorlet in order to shut it down 
and sell off its assets while gaining its market share. 
  "I cannot see any other reason Pratt &amp; Whitney would be 
interested in Motorlet," says Michal Kraus, a leading member of 
the Social Democratic Party bloc in parliament. Kraus has called 
for establishing a parliamentary commission to examine the 
collapse of the Czech aircraft industry. "They [Pratt &amp; 
Whitney] 
have had to lay off 50 percent of their own work force. I don't 
think it would go over very well in Canada if they started doing 
production over here." 
  Houska says he decided to buy Aero in its entirety after 
learning that Aero had been privatized in a way that would allow 
it to hold on to its subsidiaries. He sees no point in trying to 
buy up one of the companies, as he attempted to do with Motorlet. 
  "When they privatized [Motorlet], they let Aero keep the 
title to the land where the factory stands," he complains. "So 
you win the competition in dollars and then you find out that 
they forgot to tell you that when it was divided into daughter 
companies, they continued to keep ownership of the land. `Yes, 
we can sell you the factory,' they'll say, `but not the land.' 
Then you're going to have to pay them rent." 
  The winner has not yet been announced in the Motorlet 
competition. Even though he says he offered 40 million Kc more 
than the competition, Houska believes the bid will probably go 
to Pratt &amp; Whitney. "I heard they were offering $10 million 
for 
Motorlet," he says. If they do win the competition, Houska says, 
Pratt &amp; Whitney will "have the Eastern market all to 
themselves."

<F P=106> [Article by Gy. Laszlo Toth: "Speculation on the Opposition </F>
Coalition: Who Is Attacking Fidesz?"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In the history of the newest 
Hungarian Republic, 1992 was the year of the far right's open 
appearance. Hungarian society--including those intellectuals who 
are involved in politics--was united in decisively condemning 
fascist manifestations. [passage omitted] At the same time, one 
part of the political opposition thought that the time had come 
to discredit the whole government and coalition, and so they 
tried to make it seem as if the appearance of the extreme right 
were a natural consequence of the government's policies: They 
tried, with the help of the leftist intellectuals who form 
public opinion, to present the whole government in fascist 
colors. [passage omitted] 
  As domestic political life developed (after the system 
changed, left-wing intellectuals and leftist liberals realized 
relatively quickly that the left-wing and liberal forces could 
be held together only to the extent that the appearance of an 
extreme right danger could be created. After all, it is the 
fascist danger that legitimizes popular front politics most 
effectively and most calmly. The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist 
Party] benefited most from the situation that developed as a 
result, because as the number of fascists "increased" more and 
more according to the media, and seemingly we came ever closer 
to the establishment of a fascist dictatorship, without anybody 
noticing it the MSZP, along with the circles around it, 
completely broke out of the spiritual ghetto into which it had 
been forced as a successor party [of the communists]. 
  The former communists and socialists, citing the fascist 
danger, got ever closer to the most significant groups of the 
SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) and to one part of the 
intellectual community. In the meantime, they did not forget 
that acting in concert more and more with the former dissidents 
would give a sort of moral rehabilitation to individuals and 
groups that had been compromised in the past. The self-appointed 
salvation movement of the intellectuals, the Democratic Charter, 
provided an excellent opportunity for this. This intellectual 
popular front movement provided the organizational means for the 
united action of the liberal and socialist political forces. 
  The idea of an opposition coalition enjoyed and still enjoys 
the support of a significant part of the Budapest and the media 
intellectuals. Such a coalition would make it possible for that 
part of the former Communist Party's nomenklatura 
that was able to "convert" its political power to economic power 
in time, to return to political power in democratic 
circumstances. Those who thought up the idea of creating the 
appearance that a "fascist" government coalition is opposed by a 
"democratic" left-wing bloc would have been able--if their plans 
had succeeded--to prevent for a long time the development of the 
turbulent democratic processes in Hungarian society. 
  It is the historical merit of the leaders of Fidesz 
[Federation of Young Democrats] that they realized that creating 
an opposition leftist bloc was not the most appropriate reaction 
to the initiatives and atrocious acts of the far right that 
erupted in 1992, because such a bloc would only serve the 
interests of the MSZP. Fidesz also condemned fascist and racist 
manifestations but, preserving its political common sense, it 
made clear that civil democratic society in Hungary is not 
threatened by any direct danger, and for that reason it would be 
inappropriate and unjustified to react by taking joint action in 
the framework of an antifascist popular front. By not making 
common cause with the Charter or with the popular front 
political activities associated with it, Fidesz essentially made 
it impossible for the existing left to return easily to 
political power. This was the original sin for which there is 
evidently no forgiveness: since that time, Fidesz has been 
constantly the target of leftist sharpshooters, who were soon 
joined by angered and disappointed left-wing liberals, since 
these liberals are much closer to the reform communist-socialist 
forces than to the pragmatic, center-right liberals who are 
devoted to the preservation of national values. 
  The left-wing "Charter" intellectuals never forget. Their 
critical senses and their hatchets were sharpened further when 
they realized that the reason Fidesz made a cooperative 
agreement with the SZDSZ on 23 January 1993 was that the 
agreement would prevent the formation of an MSZP-SZDSZ leftist 
bloc and the further drift of the SZDSZ toward the MSZP. Since 
then, hardly a day has passed that we have not been able to read 
in some left-wing source, or in one that is influenced by the 
SZDSZ, either an article condemning Fidesz or some negative 
commentary regarding the Orban-Kover [Fidesz leaders] duo. There 
is no mercy! The objectivity of the attacks is well illustrated 
by the fact that not long ago they hurled accusations of 
anti-Semitism against Kover, even though Kover was among the 
first in parliament to condemn all forms of fascism. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is a telling sign that even after popular front politics 
lost its relevance--because the fascist danger was dropped from 
the agenda of the leftists and intellectuals who form public 
opinion--the anti-Fidesz campaign continued. The reason for this 
is probably that in 1992 the left-wing intellectual community 
came to realize that Fidesz is not a left-wing party and that, 
moreover, it is trying to distance itself from the socialist 
left, thereby reducing the MSZP's chances of gaining power. In 
any case, it is worth thinking about the fact that those who are 
discrediting Fidesz are precisely the ones who in 1992 saw 
fascist storm troopers behind every bush and impatiently urged 
the formation of an antifascist united front.

<F P=106> [Interview with Geza Jeszenszky, minister of foreign </F>
affairs, by Witold Pawlowski; place and date not given: "Moods 
in a Waiting Room"] 
  [Excerpts] [Pawlowski] The meeting in Prague was meant to 
be a good test for the Visegrad Group. Euphemistically speaking, 
it did not turn out to be successful. The hosts came up with an 
idea to seat the delegations at separate national tables during 
the official dinner. Is this separation a sign that the group 
will part company? 
  [Jeszenszky] Central Europe specifically represented by the 
Visegrad Group has a concrete base, bound by historical and 
dynastic ties, the experience of the 18th and 19th centuries, 
the loss and regaining of independence, the difficult task of 
regaining statehood, and the common experience with communism. 
Today's problems, specifically those of the four countries, our 
mentality, the state of the environment. Everything is similar. 
  [Pawlowski] One can see that this is still too little. Does 
the clear lack of interest from the Czech side and the growing 
strain between the Hungarians and the Slovaks mean that the 
group has de facto fallen apart? 
  [Jeszenszky] Regardless of whether someone likes the name 
Visegrad Group and the idea of common meetings and 
consultations, Central Europe exists because of historical, 
cultural, and economic ties. Specifically, the last two need 
rejuvenation. The CEFTA [Central European Free Trade 
Association] free trade zone should help in this. Paradoxically, 
foreigners are also helping us; the Americans, who sought to 
have the four [Visegrad Group] hold a joint meeting in Prague, 
also the European Union and other European institutions that 
treat us as a group of states. 
  Hungary and Poland are for continuing this form of 
cooperation. Slovakia, although with less enthusiasm, is also 
behind this. The Czechs will also come around to realizing that 
there are no shortcuts into Europe or NATO and that all of our 
countries will more or less at the same time enter European 
institutions. At that point, we should maintain Central European 
Solidarity, just like the Scandinavian countries. 
  [Pawlowski] Solidarity is a beautiful word. Will Slovenia 
join us? The Hungarians are already laying the groundwork. 
  [Jeszenszky] Slovenia is doing splendidly and does not 
deserve to be on the sidelines just because it was a republic in 
Yugoslavia in the past. 
  [Pawlowski] Who else is waiting in line? 
  [Jeszenszky] I am not against new members, but we should not 
forget about the Central European Initiative, the CEI, grouping 
us with many of our neighbors. It does not matter what this 
organization will be called because we cannot escape from our 
neighbors. [passage omitted] 
  [Pawlowski] The elections in Europe were a surprise on both 
sides of the former Iron Curtain. Social frustrations becoming 
apparent. Extremists are coming to the fore, from both the left 
and the right. Populists, nationalists. Do you believe, sir, 
that, in the spring parliamentary elections, the Italian 
scenario may repeat itself in Hungary, when in the end the 
socialists, yesterday's communists, and the far right met? 
  [Jeszenszky] Italy is Italy, and Hungary is Hungary. I 
believe that in Hungary the elections will be between the 
parties from the center. In Hungary, there are some extremists 
of various shades, but they are not strong or radical or 
dangerous enough. [passage omitted] 
  [Pawlowski] Mr. Minister, you stated that Hungarian 
politicians do not differ on foreign policy. Didn't this 
consensus collapse when Istvan Csurka attacked the proposal in 
parliament concerning the final borders between Ukraine and 
Hungary? 
  [Jeszenszky] Mr. Csurka is finished as a politician who many 
times has shown the total erroneousness of his ideas. His 
behavior at the time of the death of Premier Antall (he 
organized a number of meetings that brutally attacked Antall's 
accomplishments--the editors) cost him even the weak support 
backing him. I would not overestimate the fact that he does not 
support Hungarian foreign policy. 
  [Pawlowski] Istvan Csurka and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy--how do 
they resemble each other and how do they differ? 
  [Jeszenszky] Zhirinovskiy knows at least a few foreign 
languages, and Csurka not even one. Csurka is less dangerous 
than Zhirinovskiy. Csurka was sharply criticized even before he 
sharpened his tone and changed his words. I am trying to decide 
whether it was that wave--maybe unjustly--that caused the 
criticism, that radicalized him. What unites them--and Csurka 
would deny this--is that they both draw attention to solving 
problems in a fashion that does not exist, they give 
prescriptions for healing the economy in an abstract manner, 
stepping away from reality that is the way demagoguery is fed. 
Both appeal to nationalistic feelings and set unrealistic goals. 
Zhirinovskiy's tone is repulsive, speaking of war and force. 
Csurka has never gone so far. Csurka is a softer, more 
restrained version of Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Pawlowski] Sir, are you not worried that, with the growth 
of 
the popularity of Csurka and similar figures, the Hungarians may 
cause problems for Europe? With their feeling of having been 
hurt historically, the complex of [the Treaty of] Trianon, which 
cut the size of Hungary by one-third; the dream of a Greater 
Hungary,a country of 15 million inhabitants. Csurka speaks 
loudly about things people want to hear. Is this true? 
  [Jeszenszky] To a large extent, the press created the Csurka 
phenomenon. Csurka's popularity is hardly growing--quite the 
contrary. I estimate his supporters to be below 5 percent. He 
also has never spoken about a greater Hungary. It is another 
matter entirely to speak of history's unfair treatment of 
Hungary, period. The Poles were not treated any better. Csurka, 
when he speaks about Hungarian minorities abroad, uses such 
language because he thinks it will be more effective. But that 
is all. Then comes the realistic way of thinking on which this 
government stands as does the greater majority of Hungarian 
society, a tolerant and patient one. [passage omitted] 
  [Pawlowski] Who is a Hungarian? Is it a question of blood, 
language, or geography? 
  [Jeszenszky] He who speaks Hungarian and considers himself 
one--just as in Poland during the time of the partitions, when 
there was no country but the people kept their roots. In some 
ways, Hungarians today are a divided people. This division 
cannot be overcome by changing the borders, but by building a 
European community, a united Europe in which Hungarians will not 
feel divided and separated. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Francesco Gerardi: "Disunite, so as to Win!"] </F>
  [Text] At the end of the "Cotroceni Round" -- as the 
dialogue initiated by the Presidency with the leaders of the 
parliamentary parties was called -- we wonder if, somehow, the 
breaking up of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] was 
the actual goal. We had in mind a number of elements, including 
the political discrediting of the chairman of the CDR by the 
spokesman of the Presidency; the attack on the Convention, which 
was considered (also by the Presidency) as an extremely 
heterogenous political formation; the partisan position, the 
authoritarian and discriminatory manner in which President 
Iliescu interprets the political game, his rather circumstantial 
statements; the real disinterest of the "chosen one of the 
nation" (or his concern only for the eyes of the world) in 
finding effective solutions for emerging from the prolonged 
political crisis. However, this new attack of the ruling party 
against the Opposition failed lamentably and succeeded only in 
making bilateral relations even more tense. The Opposition, that 
is, the CDR plus the Democratic Party [PD], refused to fall into 
the trap of any kind of separate discussions with the Presidency 
and, indirectly, in a disguised manner, with the ruling party, 
thus demonstrating that it is a coherent and orderly force, 
which is perfectly motivated to achieve a common goal: the 
formation of a new parliamentary majority which can support a 
stable and effective government. This "stubbornness," this 
spirit of a selfish opposition, this change of tactics might 
create the impression that they have surprised the Presidency 
and the Party of Social Democracy of Romania [PSDR], which are 
accustomed to resolving much more rapidly and "once and for all" 
the problems posed by their adversary (there were enough 
examples during the past two or three years). All the more so 
since President Iliescu has felt that he was "obliged" to state 
that his intention (and that of the institution which he 
represents) was misunderstood: the goal was only to achieve a 
political pact -- "or whatever you would call a document which 
aimed at an agreement on the framework for the civilized 
development of activity, of life, and of political 
confrontation, if you wish"). That is, something which could be 
defined "possibly, as a code of ethics for our political life" 
and which envisages, for a long period of time, the cooperation 
of the parties in a "climate which is favorable for all." After 
the PDSR, at the request of the president, presents a first 
draft of such a document, things will be clearer. Now, 
everything is in the stage of good, sincere intentions. On the 
other hand, after it let it be known that, at present, it has no 
thought of sharing (democratically appropriated) power, but, in 
addition, together with all its "lame ducks," that is, the PSM 
[Socialist Labor Party], the PRM [Greater Romania Party], the 
PDAR [Romanian Democratic Agrarian Party], and the PUNR 
[Romanian National Unity Party], it would form a "monolithic 
family," a sort of "united left" (from the center to the extreme 
and back), the PDSR announced its availability for a dialogue 
with the CDR, first of all, on a general level, "based on the 
differences which are smaller between us and the CDR, such as, 
for example, in the field of foreign policy. Then we will go 
toward an area which can mean a political pact, based on certain 
elements, possibly an agreement on an economic strategy for the 
next decades. Finally, there might also be a discussion about a 
pact on governing." (Adrian Nastase said this!) So, if you had 
any fears, be at peace; we will have many victories, at least 
for the next few decades! Exactly like it was with the deceased, 
disguised, and reformed Romanian Communist Party, some people 
say. 
  Joined together, the two explanations of attitudes, of the 
Presidency and the PDSR, do nothing but create a breathing space 
(or stall for time), so the tactical register could be changed. 
Since, recently, the "Trojan horse" of Cotroceni, that is, PUNR 
Senator Viorel Salagean, said: the PDSR should form a government 
with the PUNR and certain parties in the Convention, such as: 
the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian Democratic Party], the PL 
'93 [Liberal Party '93], or the PAC [Civic Alliance Party], 
obviously supported in the Parliament by other parties, 
including the PD. In addition -- and pay attention to this! -- 
according to the "certain" information which Mr. Salagean has, 
the PD is planning a pact with the PDSR "which is not just 
possible, but will happen very soon." There has been talk since 
last fall about the involvement of the PNTCD in the government; 
about the courting of liberals; and even about the 
"reconciliation of the Siamese twins." So there is nothing 
completely new in this -- except for the fact that the leaders 
of the PNTCD have repeatedly declined the "offer" of the PDSR 
and we do not know why they would change their opinion now and, 
moreover, why they would compromise themselves by a misalliance 
with the "provincial party" of the garrulous inimitable one, Gh. 
Funar, (who, with the PRM party leader, [Corneliu] Vadim Tudor, 
forms the ultranationalist tandem of Romanian politics). As for 
the PD, its detachment from the CDR and its rapprochement to the 
PDSR -- that is, the re-establishment of the 1990 National 
Salvation Front -- would compromise it once and for all. But, we 
do not believe that, after so much energy has been spent in 
redefining itself politically and rebuilding the image which it 
lost after the rash coexistence in 1990-91, the PD would have 
forgotten the Fall of 1991 when "someone" put a "knife to its 
throat" and, for the sake of the "rasol" [boiled meat], would 
dig its own grave. During the past two years, Petre Roman 
demonstrated that he learned a lot about politics (first of all, 
from his own mistakes, and then, from others), that his 
performance on the Romanian political stage is not over, and 
that it is not by chance that EURONEWS, in a report at the end 
of 1993, calls him a "politician of high caliber," along with 
Ion Ratiu, who, if properly utilized, could change the image of 
Romania in the world. 
  The conclusion? The recent statement of the PUNR (?!) 
senator, Viorel Salagean, was only a new attempt to sow discord, 
suspicion, and dissent, and to dismember the political forces of 
the Opposition. If this does not succeed, there will certainly 
be other attempts. More refined and improved. The current Ruling 
Party will use all possible maneuvers to wear down its 
adversary, because only in this way can the agony be prolonged. 
And along with this, our misery, the suffering of an entire 
nation that is not completely awake.

<F P=106> [Article by Francesco Gerardi: "As Was Expected, the PUNR </F>
Swallowed Its Pride"] 
  [Text] Anyone who did not believe in the monolithic unity 
of the PDSR [Party of Social Democracy of Romania], and believed 
that it would yield and agree to share its "democratically 
adjudicated" power, has deceived himself. Anyone who believed in 
the "ramming" force of the PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party] 
has also deceived himself. On the Romanian political scene, 
things will continue to remain as they have been. At least this 
is the outcome of the much awaited and much trumpeted "summit" 
meeting on Monday night between the PDSR and PUNR staffs. 
Although the "provincial party" of Mr. Funar said that it was 
"disappointed because of the postponement of the discussions" 
and morally offended by the insulting remark that its entry into 
the government had "an unpleasant effect abroad," finally, it 
had to swallow its pride once again (after the retraction in 
regard to the "Caritas" pyramid scheme in exchange for the 
promise that it would have a role in the governing process) and 
stop threatening to withdraw parliamentary support for the 
present government. However, this decision was made by Caesarean 
section and seems to have left some traces. Since, at the time 
of the nocturnal summit, two factions seemed to be clearly 
outlined: that of Mr. Funar (who persisted in the idea of 
withdrawing parliamentary support) and that of Deputy Chairman 
Ioan Gavra (who lowered the flag, agreeing to five-party 
negotiations for a possible reorganization, only to become poor 
PUNR members with something like the "bone of discord".) At 
breakfast, Oliviu Gherman, chairman of the governing party, was 
finally able to calm down Funar and his people, promising them 
that the PDSR would accept the protocol for governing adopted in 
Cluj, a protocol which would be the object of negotiations among 
the five parties (the PDSR, PUNR, PSM [Socialist Labor Party], 
PRM [Greater Romania Party], and PDAR [Romanian Democratic 
Agrarian Party]), which will conclude on 1 March. Although, in 
accordance with the psychological warfare of parallel 
statements, nothing should be taken seriously: "It is fortunate 
that this provision (that is, the five-party structure -- our 
note) will not be final, probably. I hope that our colleagues 
will have good sense and will not get into such things" (PUNR 
deputy Horea Pop); "We have gained two weeks; the PUNR has given 
up the idea of a two-color government and has accepted, in 
principle, the idea of a government that includes 
representatives of the Opposition. The deadline can be extended 
since it is not final" (Dumitru Pislaru -- PDSR spokesman). In 
conclusion, here are the words of a much quoted and disputed 
Dambovitan politician: In politics (and, especially, in 
present-day Romanian politics) there is always a subterfuge, 
therefore, nothing sensational!

<F P=106> [Interview with Gheorghe Prisacaru, member of the Central </F>
Executive Bureau, head of the International Department of the 
Party of Social Democracy of Romania, by Constantin Benga; place 
and date not given: "Connecting to Western Democratic Values"] 
  [Text] [Benga] Recently, the contacts of the PDSR [Party of 
Social Democracy of Romania] with French political groups have 
become quite frequent. What is the explanation for this 
development? 
  [Prisacaru] As a government party, the PDSR bears, to a 
great 
extent, responsibility for the foreign policy promoted by the 
Government of Romania. However, from this point of view, it is 
known that one of our priority objectives is connecting to 
Western democratic values, including those of the French. The 
development of Romanian-French relations responds not only to 
the call of history but also to the requirements of the period 
in which we are living. We are sure that France can give more 
active support to the reform process and the integration of 
Romania into the European structures and that our Latin sisters 
cannot remain indifferent to the enhancement of the role of our 
country as a factor of stability in our zone. There is no doubt 
that the state visit which President Ion Iliescu will make to 
France in April is part of this process. Democratic political 
groups in both countries can contribute -- through dialogue and 
cooperation -- to the promotion of fruitful collaboration in a 
wide variety of fields. 
  [Benga] What political groups did you meet with during your 
recent visit to France? 
  [Prisacaru] Let me begin with the French Socialist Party 
which, like the PDSR, ascribes to modern social-democratic 
values. The discussions with Gerard Fuchs, member of the 
Executive Bureau, secretary for international affairs of the 
French Socialist Party, proved the usefulness of this meeting 
for a better knowledge of the objectives and concerns of the two 
parties. Of course, the French Socialist Party, which became an 
opposition party after the recent elections, is especially 
concerned with defining objectives, both in domestic and 
international policy, which would permit the recovery of lost 
political capital and, at the same time, of its electorate. The 
impressive street demonstration in Paris on 16 February. in 
support of public and lay education, of which the French 
Socialist Party was one of the main organizers, proved this. The 
approaching elections for the European Parliament offer the 
Socialist Party the opportunity to present the preponderantly 
European option which it established at the time of the last 
party congress in November 1993, at which the former prime 
minister, Michel Rocard, took over the leadership of the party. 
The hosts demonstrated a special interest in learning about the 
current political situation and the development of the process 
of transition in Romania as well as the way in which the PDSR 
intends to supersede existing difficulties. We also met with 
Jean Claude Mignon, deputy in the French National Assembly and 
national secretary for the Eastern Democracies in the Assembly 
for the Republic Party (RPR), which is currently the governing 
party. The artisan and president of this party -- Gaullist in 
essence --is Jacques Chirac, the mayor general of Paris, and the 
current prime minister of France, Eduard Balladur, belongs to 
this party. I must confess that I had an extremely pleasant 
surprise when, during my discussions with the RPR 
representative, I noted not only a genuine interest in gaining 
the proper perception of the socio-political situation in 
Romania but also a great desire to continue the dialogue on the 
ways to promote a closer Romanian-French collaboration. Finally, 
the third group with which we had discussions was the Movement 
of Leftist Radicals (MRS), one of the oldest French political 
groups, which has parliamentary repesentation, and which gave 
France a far from negligible number of political personalities. 
Few people know that the MRS is one of the first parties -- 
before the appearance of some distinct groups -- to be concerned 
about ecological issues. Not affiliated with any existing 
international organization -- neither socialist, nor liberal, 
nor Christian-Democratic -- the MRS supports the idea of the 
establishment of a structure of centrist parties which, 
especially in the northern countries of Europe, enjoy 
considerable popularity. Both sides expressed a desire to 
continue to exchange opinions on matters of common interest. 
  [Benga] From what you have said, it appears that you will 
not 
limit your contacts in France to the Socialist Party. Is this a 
more general option for the PDSR? 
  [Prisacaru] Indeed, this is a basic option of our party. Of 
course, we are assigning the proper importance to the promotion 
of cooperation with the socialist and social-democratic parties 
which are members of the Socialist International or are 
interested in associating with it in one form or another. 
However, this does not mean that we are not promoting a dialogue 
with other democratic political groups. The relations which the 
PDSR has with parties outside the socialist spectrum in Greece, 
France, Great Britain, Spain, or Italy are proof of this option. 
In any case, in the eyes of these groups, the PDSR is neither 
"cryptocommunist" nor "antireformist." On the contrary, they 
evaluate the PDSR not so much on the basis of such statements, 
as, in particular, on the basis of its concrete actions which 
prove its total commitment to expanding the democratic 
processes, establishing the state of law and the market economy, 
stopping the decline and, in the future, raising the standard of 
level of the population. We presented such aspects to our French 
hosts so that our partners would get to know us better and would 
have the most accurate picture of Romania. 
  [Benga] Were you invited to the French Communist Party 
Congress? 
  [Prisacaru] We received an invitation to the congress but 
our 
party did not attend. We are awaiting with interest the 
decisions of the congress regarding the orientation of its 
program and the principles of organizing the party, keeping in 
mind the fact that this represents the interests of a certain 
segment of the French population. Dialogue and cooperation with 
this leftist French party remain an open possibility. Everything 
depends on the identification, in the future, of common options 
which would promote the development of Romanian-French relations 
and peace and security in the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Mihai Cernat: "The PDSR Supports the </F>
Acceleration of the Process of Privatization and Restructuring"] 
  [Text] The set of "objectives and priorities of 
socioeconomic strategy," drawn up by the PDSR [Party of Social 
Democracy of Romania] and expected to be applied this year, 
which is considered to be absolutely crucial for the fate of our 
country, is considered to be the response of the governing party 
to the current crisis situation and, at the same time, it is 
also a response to the groping and searching of the 
restructuring department of the government in regard to the 
acceleration of the reform. 
  Reality has proven that, in the past four years, a number of 
elements have been accumulated which have not only permitted 
access to stronger measures for the transformation of the 
economy, first of all, into a market economy, but which also 
require the application of these measures. In this context, the 
program proposed by the PDSR is notable for its obviously 
pragmatic character. Its point of departure is the fact that, 
legislatively, Romania has succeeded in eliminating the 
backwardness in reforms compared to the neighboring countries. 
There is another fact which can be deduced from the structure of 
the entire program drawn up by this party -- namely, the fact 
that the reform which it would like to have accelerated on all 
levels is not an act of virtuosity but one which is absolutely 
necessary for the achievement, in time, of an economy which is 
in harmony with the Western countries and in accordance with the 
human and material resources available to us. 
  In this context, in 1994, all attention should be 
concentrated on ensuring stability and economic recovery, for a 
greater coherence of socioeconomic reform, with emphasis on two 
basic elements -- privatization and restructuring. Also, it will 
be absolutely necessary to take a number of austerity measures. 
Without going into detail in regard to such a far-reaching and 
ambitious program which offers, upto the end of this year, 
possibilities for our economic recovery and, to a no lesser 
extent, for our social recovery, we will, however, try to 
present a few of the illustrative elements. Thus, ensuring the 
development of industrial production (a process for which some 
opportunities were offered in 1993) will mean technological 
modernization and restructuring of production in all branches. 
Labor productivity and product competitiveness will increase. 
The structure of services will be developed and diversified. The 
investment process will be reinvigorated and the inflation rate 
will be controlled. At the end of the year, the rate of 
inflation will be about 75 percent higher than in December 1993. 
  In the field of privatization, first of all, in addition to 
supporting competent institutions capable of applying the 
development strategy of the private sector (the National Agency 
for Privatization and the Romanian Development Agency), we will 
aim to privatize 2,300-2,400 commercial companies. An action 
worthy of attention will be the utilization of ownership 
certificates, which, at present, is only a hope. At the same 
time, efforts will be intensified to clarify the system of 
ownership in agriculture, aiming at the issuance of at least 1.5 
million property titles so that this process can be concluded in 
1995. 
  Restructuring, an extremely important process, must be 
expanded. However, this does not mean -- and the PDSR program 
points this out -- the dismemberment of national industry or 
ultimately, the deindustrialization of the country. Also, it 
must not be interpreted as a cause of unemployment or as an 
occasion for importing products which will no longer be supplied 
by Romanian industry. However, the national economy must be 
"purged" of nonviable economic agents. Competitive fields, as 
well as economic agents with the same defining characteristics, 
must be stimulated. We will not dwell upon the implications of 
this measure for individual branches of industry, but we will 
mention only a few basic principles with the aid of which the 
planned dimensions will be given to this work. Thus, among other 
things, we will allocate financial resources to obtain the 
necessary financing for the restructuring program by giving 
governmental guarantees and assuming state debts upto the limit 
of 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product, obtaining foreign 
sources of financing, in the form of reimbursable and 
nonreimbursable credits, soliciting, on a priority basis, the 
technical assistance of international bodies in drafting and 
implementing the priority restructuring program and the 
medium-term and long-term strategies for the restructuring 
process, including assistance in the juridical and legislative 
domains. Also, public corporations will be discussed and 
restructured. 
  Of course, only a careful examination of this program could 
demonstrate the solid and coherent policy planned for this 
sector which is so responsive to restructuring. The policy also 
calls for a resumption of investment activity by giving priority 
to projects already begun, by clarifying the situations of 
suspended projects whose continuation is opportune, by 
establishing measures with a view to finalizing the public 
investment program for energy, transportation and 
telecommunications, land improvement, water resources, forests, 
and environmental protection, the communal-administrative 
infrastructure of localities, as well as urbanism and 
territorial management. 
  The wage and price policy will be a very important element. 
In this area, first of all, efforts will be made to create the 
legislative and institutional framework for the protection of 
competition and to pursue the strict observance of regulations 
in this field, in accordance with the free action of economic 
agents and the general interest of economic and social 
stability. In regard to prices, the intervention of the state 
will be limited only to fields which contain the attributes of 
natural monopolies. For this purpose, competition-type 
infrastructures for purchasing, processing, and distribution 
will be gradually created. And, finally, the legislative 
framework will be set up for institutional structures to protect 
competition. The wage policy will be geared toward stopping 
inflationist pressure and promoting competition in the national 
economy. 
  The budgetary and fiscal domains and the fields of monetary 
and hard currency policy have not been neglected. Also, actions 
and measures for achieving objectives and priorities for foreign 
economic relations, for scientific research and technological 
development, education, human resources, health care and medical 
treatment, culture, local public administration, national 
defense, and reform in the field of justice are being thought 
about. We will mention, from the fiscal domain, the presentation 
to Parliament of laws on the profit tax, the general income tax, 
the tax on agricultural income and local fees and taxes. In 
regard to the restructuring of budgetary expenditures, among 
other things, wage limits will be introduced and the number of 
public functionaries will be reduced, among other ways, by the 
effects of the law on the organization of the activity of the 
government and the ministries. Subsidies for 1994 will amount to 
only 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product. We will aim for 
a significant increase in the financial autonomy of the public 
administration and special importance will be given to the 
organization of institutions for stock market transactions. 
  The Party of Social Democracy is asking the government to 
place measures of social protection at the center of attention. 
In this field, the program has several priorities: the 
protection of the incomes of the population by slowing down and 
stopping the deterioration of their purchasing power, the 
stimulation of the demand for workers and the social protection 
of the unemployed; the acceleration of the process of reforming 
social security and public assistance systems, the improvement 
of working conditions and the support of the construction of 
housing for the people. As for the employment of the labor force 
and the social protection of the unemployed, in 1994, a draft 
law on the professional formation, advanced training, 
retraining, and recycling of workers will be promoted. For a 
better administration of the unemployment fund, a tripartite 
system will be instituted for the fund's administration and 
monitoring. In regard to the protection of the income of the 
people, there are plans to improve the system of indexing 
incomes, perfecting the mechanism of moderating the total cost 
increases with wages, correlating the base wages of personnel in 
public institutions with those negotiated in other sectors of 
activity, as well as protecting the wages of persons with low 
incomes by ensuring the payment of the minimum wage and its 
periodic review. 
  The reform of the social security system will also aim at 
the 
establishment of autonomous risk insurance banks and will ensure 
that budgetary expenses for social security are limited to 8-8.5 
percent of the gross domestic product. In its turn, social 
security will undergo profound transformations. This will 
include a law for the protection of minors in special 
situations, as well as a law on special protection for people 
with handicaps. There are plans to improve the legislative and 
institutional framework for labor safety and working conditions. 
Finally, the construction of housing will be encouraged and 
supported. In this area, the construction of 17,000 apartments, 
currently in different stages of execution, will be completed. 
The legislative framework and the necessary institutions for 
financing housing construction will be created. The construction 
of public housing for families with modest incomes will begin, 
about 3,000 lower quality apartments will be rehabilitated, and 
the program of consolidating buildings destroyed by earthquakes 
will be continued. This economic strategy program of the PDSR 
also makes references to the foreign policy of the country, 
stressing, in this area, the elements which define our actions 
in the context of a definitive rapprochement of Western European 
structures to North Atlantic structures. In essence, the few 
elements which we mentioned are proof that the PDSR is 
tenaciously working for the consolidation of the state of law, 
the acceleration of economic reform, and restructuring and 
privatization, along with the assurance of real social 
protection, in accordance with the laws and interests of Romania.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dumitru Popa, director general of Romanian </F>
Television, by Dan Priesz; place and date not given: "Don't 
Expect Me To Make Television in My Own Image and Likeness"] 
  [Text] The new director of Romanian Television [TVR], 
Dumitru Popa, former professor in the Faculty of Journalism in 
Stefan Gheorghiu Academy, former state secretary in the 
Department of Information of the Government, states that he 
intends of create a politically impartial TVR. This is his 
promise. However, can this promise be kept by the person who 
was, up to now, the chief of government propaganda? 
  [Priesz] Mr. Dumitru Popa, you are in a very "hot" seat. Do 
you consider yourselves appointed by an interim statute or a 
permanent one? 
  [Popa] I consider it to be a provisional position in which 
the evolution of the law places me. When the law on the 
organization and operation of the TVR company appears, the 
election of the director general and of other persons in the 
leadership will be organized in accordance with the law. My 
situation, and, if you will, my luck, is that I am in a 
temporary situation. I could measure my efforts and escape "with 
my life" from this very difficult, but not unbearable, position. 
  [Priesz] What was the official mandate with which the prime 
minister invested you? 
  [Popa] The decision of the prime minister specifies a 
mandate 
which lasts until the publication and application of the law. 
  [Priesz] After that date, would you be willing to remain 
director general of TVR? 
  [Popa] I took the position for this period, with a contented 
conscience. I believe that the interim period will probably last 
a month or two. I hope that Parliament will hurry to adopt the 
law. I do not think that I will continue.... Each person has his 
chance. A person's chances do not depend only on hierarchies but 
also on an interior life, on cultural and moral options. 
  [Preisz] What, do you think, are your special traits which 
caused you to be preferred by the prime minister at the present 
time? 
  [Popa] It is hard for me to talk about myself. I believe 
that 
I have a special trait. It could be balance. I am not a 
political employee; I am not a member of any political party. 
Thus, I have to say that I would like TVR to be an apolitical 
and credible public service. But these issues of content take 
shape with great difficulty. 
  [Priesz] Did you ever work in the audiovisual field? 
  [Popa] Not directly.... 
  [Priesz] Don't you think this is an obstacle to 
understanding 
the operations of this institution? 
  [Popa] In the Faculty of Journalism, we had laboratories 
dealing with this field. I am sure that this medium is not 
absolutely foreign to me, but I cannot say that I would be able 
to give precise, concrete technical guidance to my colleagues 
here. Probably I would not be able to.... 
  [Preisz] What do you think about the fact that you were 
appointed from outside TVR? 
  [Popa] Outside TVR, but I am lucky that I am not from 
outside 
the press.... If you note carefully, very rarely is anyone from 
the press appointed to the job. I would like to say something in 
all honesty. I believe in the professionalism of the people in 
TVR and in my own professionalism, in general. My work principle 
will be not to do alone what I cannot resolve alone. Therefore, 
I have to have some support, an adviser, an exchange of thoughts 
and ideas on what we should present to the public. Professional 
discussion in TVR will become a work method. When we have any 
doubts, we will consult at least two or three people. This seems 
to me to be normal and natural. 
  [Priesz] The board of directors of TVR, in its present form, 
was critcized, along with the way in which Mr. Everac ran it. 
What is your relationship to him, in this context? 
  [Popa] In all honesty, I must tell you that -- at this time 
-- I do not have a full response. So far, I have met with the 
members of the Board of Directors. I already knew quite a few of 
them. The meeting was absolutely normal. This week I will delve 
more deeply into matters and will see what the situation is. So 
far, I have not seen anything which indicates disfunctionality 
or disharmony on the Board. It seems to me that, up to now, what 
you said was true.... I do not have complete information yet but 
that moment, the moment of the resignations, was a moment like 
so many others. However, I have confidence in the TVR people, in 
their choices and comments, in all the areas of activity of TVR. 
It will be natural for me to delve into the problems and to 
receive all the comments. Do not expect me to make television in 
my image and likeness, to conform to my views. 
  [Preisz] What is the status of resignations from the Board? 
  [Popa] I cannot give you a precise answer. I do not know 
exactly what has happened or who has reconsidered his signature. 
I will be concerned about this, if necessary. But, I believe 
that it is a matter of something in the past... 
  [Priesz] You were a professor at Stefan Gheorghiu Academy. 
Are you marked by this period? 
  [Popa] Up to now, I have not spoken publicly about what is 
called the period as "professor at Stefan Gheorghiu". I do not 
want to exonerate myself, in any way. Of course, we cannot 
compare the situation in the Faculty of Journalism to that in 
other faculties. However, there were some aspects of 
conditioning. The most important was that there were some 
students who were recruited in advance by the publications and 
who received a scholarship. 
  [Preisz] Mr. Popa, don't forget the essential criterion! -- 
that of unconditional subservience to the ruling elite of the 
Romanian Communist Party! 
  [Popa] The most rigorous political criteria were 
introduced... More rigorous than those in the faculties of law 
or philosophy. We had students who were simple members of the 
Union of Communist Youth or party members. There was no problem. 
Of course, at a given moment, a certain type of candidate was in 
the majority. At least formally, it was a state faculty.... 
  [Preisz] Recently, as head of the Government's Department of 
Information, you learned about the "documentary" of the evening 
of 30 December? In your official capacity in the Department, 
should or shouldn't you have learned about the intention to 
produce and show such a film which members of the executive 
organ subsequently officially withdrew? 
  [Popa] I don't know anything about the 30 December 
documentary. Indeed, the prime minister could never have known 
about the existence of the images, about the possibility of 
producing this documentary and its possible showing. There was 
no official order from the government to make such a 
documentary. Heaven forbid! It was said and it was explained 
that, in fact, the Government Studio had the contribution since 
it was made there. On the other hand, it was not necessary for 
me to know about the existence of this documentary... 
  [Preisz] As director general of Romanian Television, have 
you 
been asked to show the entire film on the execution of Marshal 
Antonescu? 
  [Popa] Currently, I do not know of any intention to show 
this 
documentary. I believe that such documentaries, with such an 
importance and such effects in history, should be seen by 
everybody. The problem is the need to put them in the given 
historic context and not to charge them with political burdens 
and tasks. As for the 30 December documentary, I think that, 
from what I have seen of it, it has a polemical character. 
  [Preisz] Mr. Popa, the leadership of TVR is accused of 
censorship -- by Mr. George Borcescu, producer of broadcasts in 
the Social Editorial Staff of TVR -- for failing to show the 
film "Punct de ruptura" [Breaking Point]. Exactly what is the 
background of the last-minute withdrawal of this material? 
  [Popa] It is a simple problem and it should be treated this 
way. I know that ROMANIA LIBERA is a newspaper which is somewhat 
provocative but there was no intention to stop the showing of 
this film. On Wednesday evening, President Iliescu met with the 
leaders of the Romanian Democratic Convention [CDR]. This moment 
put relations, political consultations, and constructive 
attitudes in a different light. It was considered that a 
"Special Edition," dealing with the consultations at Cotroceni, 
was absolutely necessary to mark this moment. 
  [Preisz] But why was the "marking" of this moment done in 
the 
time period set for a film produced by one of the "inconvenient" 
producers of TVR? 
  [Popa] I believe that, in the given context, such a 
documentary would have produced unexpected effects and, perhaps, 
disservices to the parties carrying on the dialog at Cotroceni. 
I did not see this documentary but, if the description in 
ROMANIA LIBERA is accurate, we can even speak about disservices 
which the CDR, itself, might have brought about. However, things 
have to be analyzed with lucidity. You can imagine how difficult 
it is to present a broadcast in which the political stake does 
not determine the commentary and the editing.... This is the 
most difficult thing which I am proposing: Romanian Television 
will become apolitical. Returning to the documentary, the things 
written in the article about Dionisie Sincan are true. But I do 
not think that Mr. Sincan deserves treatment from the censor 
since the issue should be treated simply as a professional one. 
We discussed the opportuneness of showing the film at this time 
and not the prohibition on showing it on the television station. 
It is possible that it will continue to be shown. The discussion 
was not about prohibition or censorship but about timeliness. 
These things happen and they are discussed in every institution 
of the mass media.

<F P=106> [Article by T.M.: "Danica Mad at Serbian Leadership"] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, 3 February -- The Serbian opposition 
magazine SRPSKA REC published a scathing criticism of Serbian 
policy written by its director Danica Draskovic, wife of 
opposition leader Vuk Draskovic. She said that there is no 
doubt about who is responsible for the war in Bosnia, that 
weapons and ammunition are manufactured in Serbia, and that 
everything began because certain people wanted to grab power. 
The accusations are directed at Radovan Karadzic and his 
associates. Danica Draskovic asks what were the reasons for the 
war, since nobody had persecuted Serbs. She compares this 
situation to Germany in 1945. At that time too, many Germans 
insisted that they had no knowledge about camps and graves. She 
believes that many Serbs will maintain the same after a year or 
two when everything will be over. 
  Danica Draskovic also accuses the Serbian Red Cross of 
arbitrarily distributing foreign humanitarian aid. This cannot 
be concealed, she adds, since even the most progovernment media 
admit that 75 percent disappears without a trace. She promises 
to inform all humanitarian organizations that the aid meant for 
the poorest and most suffering people ends up on the black 
market controlled by the Serbian authorities.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 28 January issue of the Ljubljana 
daily DELO carries on page 6 a report by "Correspondent" Zdravko 
Latal titled "Silajdzic Severely Criticized" based on a 
one-page-long article published in the Bosnian paper BOSNJACKI 
AVAZ and written by that paper's director and owner, Fahrudin 
Radoncic. 
  According to the DELO article, Radoncic accuses Haris 
Silajdzic of having failed to "establish Bosnia-Herzegovina 
diplomacy" while he was foreign minister in the Bosnian 
Government and questions his qualifications for his current post 
of prime minister, since "he has no background in economics." 
Radoncic claims that Silajdzic's government has done nothing to 
improve living conditions, which he describes as its most 
important task other than defense. According to Radoncic, 
Silajdzic still prefers the "diplomatic salon life" to solving 
the everyday problems of survival in Sarajevo and the "free 
territories." 
  As reported in DELO, Radoncic also disparages Silajdzic's 
education (a religious school in Sarajevo, a theological school 
in Libya, and a doctorate from the Pristina University), and his 
work experiences (a translator for Belgrade businesses in Libya, 
a chief of cabinet a former reis-ul-ulema). As for Silajdzic's 
private life, DELO writes, Radoncic disapproves of the fact that 
Silajdzic's family has been sent to live safely in Turkey, while 
his sister was appointed ambassador to Turkey and later to 
Pakistan. Silajdzic himself, DELO cites Radoncic as writing, has 
never visited the front lines or liberated areas, and he tries 
to "overshadow" President Alija Izetbegovic. 
  DELO correspondent Latal comments that while some of this 
criticism is not new, it is "most specific and severe." The 
logical question, Latal observes, is who stands behind BOSNJACKI 
AVAZ and Radoncic. 
  According to some sources, Latal reports, Radoncic's 
supporters can be found among older Party of Democratic Action 
members or the party hardliners who favored Dr. Edib Bukvic for 
the post of prime minister and also opposed three new members of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency: Kljuic, Komsic, and, in 
particular, Durakovic. 
  Other sources, Latal states, claim that both Silajdzic and 
BOSNJACKI AVAZ are supported by foreign powers. Latal cites Dr. 
Ejup Ganic, a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, as a 
supporter of BOSNJACKI AVAZ and another plausible source of the 
criticism of Silajdzic. Ganic first publicly attacked Prime 
Minister Silajdzic for the "lack of a government program." He 
then denounced the Geneva Declaration as a "continuation of the 
Karadjordjevo agreement" between Presidents Milosevic and 
Tudjman. Latal notes that Silajdzic, on the other hand, had 
assessed the Geneva Declaration positively, saying that it could 
lead to "mutual recognition." 
  But most people believe, Latal concludes, that BOSNJACKI 
AVAZ 
is supported by Sefer Halilovic, former Bosnia-Herzegovina army 
chief and "the strong Sandzak lobby." Radoncic and Halilovic are 
both from Sandzak. Radoncic used to be Halilovic's spokesman 
before Silajdzic, as prime minister, purged the army of all 
commanders involved in war crimes and other criminal activities. 
Latal cites rumors that Halilovic will be rehabilitated soon and 
receive the rank of general. 
  According to DELO, Silajdzic has yet to prove himself. Among 
other things, he is being attacked in Sarajevo for his "futile" 
meetings with Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Srpska 
assembly.

  [Text] At the end of the week, the August national service 
intake was discharged prematurely. The President of the 
Republic, who as supreme commander of the armed forces decides 
on the early release, taking into consideration the national 
security conditions and the combat readiness of the armed 
forces, had not been informed beforehand. Compulsory military 
service in Slovenia lasts seven months. So far the President has 
signed the early discharge of recruits from May, October and 
December 1992, and from April, June, October and November last 
year. This time the release took place without the knowledge of 
President Kucan. Defence Minister Jansa pointed to the legal 
vagueness concerning jurisdiction resulting from the 
contradictions between the Law on Defence and existing 
Constitution, as well as the Constitutional Court resolution of 
December 13, which took the position that the competences of the 
former state president do not transfer automatically to the 
current President. It is true that the President decides on 
early discharge, claims Jansa, but nowhere is it stipulated at 
whose proposal. To avoid such confusion in the future, the 
Defence Minister suggests that the government decide on the 
adoption of a necessary military legislation, after receiving 
the opinion of the President of the Republic. The President's 
Office said that the President was in favour of early discharge 
if the legal conditions existed. Recognising his 
responsibilities to this generation of soldiers too, he had been 
expecting the Defence Minister to propose their early discharge. 
Since the Minister failed to do so and discharged the recruits 
of his own accord, the Office judges the action of the Defence 
Minister to be evidently unlawful and arbitrary.

  [Text] Today, the government passed the proposal of the 
law on the 1994 budget and its realization, which the State 
Chamber is supposed to pass by the end of March at the latest. 
Finance Minister Mitja Gaspari presented it at a news 
conference. Suzana Kos reports: 
  [Begin Kos recording] At today's session, the government 
finally passed the 1994 budget. The treasury will amount to 402 
billion tolars, while the deficit is supposed to be 8.9 billion 
tolars. 
  The greatest portion of the funds in the treasury -- 373 
billion tolars -- will, of course, come from taxes, while 20 
billion will come from non-tax sources. 
  The obligations from this year's budget will be 348 billion 
tolars, while 52 billion will be intended for various 
investments. Officially, the budget document will reach 
parliament tomorrow. Next week, the government is also supposed 
to send a document on the public deficit of the Republic of 
Slovenia and a report on the financial rehabilitation of 
commercial banks. 
  Let me quote some other budget figures. The Finance 
Ministry has the greatest share in budgetary expenditure, 
amounting to 92 billion tolars. This figure comprises the 
obligations of the state toward the Pensions' and Disability 
Fund, the Agency for Construction of Highways, and toward 
foreign counties. The second greatest share of 86 billion 
tolars will go to the Labor Ministry, followed by the Defense 
Ministry, the Ministry of Justice, and other departments. 
  The government was supposed to discuss the problems 
surrounding our debt to commercial banks again today. However, 
because Defense Minister Jansa put forward a sort of document at 
the session, that is to say, proposed new conclusions to resolve 
this issue, the government will discuss this topic again next 
week, when it will also study Minister Jansa's new proposals. 
  It is interesting to note that the finance minister did not 
wish to answer when he was asked whether a repeated debate and 
confirmation of already agreed conclusions regarding debts 
toward the commercial banks is really necessary. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Tulevski: "Macedonians on Trial"] </F>
  [Text] The plight of the Macedonians in Bulgaria continues 
despite the alleged policy of our eastern neighbor, in its 
transition to European, just, and civilized values. This, some 
will say extremely harsh, claim can be easily justified by what 
has been published over the past few days: The district 
prosecutor of the town of Sandanski has leveled charges against 
four distinguished activists of the United Macedonian 
Organization [OMO] "Ilinden" for organizing an illegal rally 
near the Rozen Monastery last year, on the occasion of the 
anniversary of Jane Sandanski's death. The head of the District 
Prosecuting Attorney's Office used Article 174 of the Criminal 
Law to institute prosecution for the organizing of meetings, 
since he was not able to find any other legislation with which 
to punish those who feel and declare themselves Macedonian. 
  Jordan Kostadinov, Bozidar Kirijanov, Vihren Zaprev, and 
Kiril Gilev can be sentenced to a year of imprisonment. That is 
the conclusion of the joint, four-year battle that they have 
waged together with hundreds of other Macedonians in Pirin 
Macedonia, with the aim of proving to the world that neither 
tsarist, nor Zivkov's totalitarian -- let alone present 
democratic -- Bulgaria can suffocate this feeling or eradicate a 
national identity. 
<H5>  "Deliberate" Justice </H5>
  Of course, the whole farce was preceded by exclusive 
preparation in the vrhovists' [Bulgarian nationalists] "studio" 
in Sofia, which involved Ivan Tatarcev, the Bulgarian prosecutor 
general, being available night and day, a man who, by the way, 
is the nephew of one of the founders of the VMRO [Internal 
Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]. The top Bulgarian 
prosecutor issued a personal warrant to start this new political 
process against the four Macedonians. Moreover, Tatarcev is 
well known to the Bulgarian public and beyond for the many cases 
of "deliberate" justice, adapting cases to the needs of 
day-to-day policy, and ignoring the provisions of the law. He 
became equally famous when he arrested two former Bulgarian 
prime ministers, Andrej Lukanov and Georgi Atanasov, by using 
ridiculous and unsubstantiated evidence adapted to fit some 
article of the criminal law adapted especially for the occasion. 
He was not ashamed to act as a prosecuting attorney in a range 
of other cases involving reprisals against various personalities 
of the former regime. 
  In any case, this is another attempt to shape the modern 
history of repression in order to deal a blow (besides using 
police batons) to a very serious movement headed by OMO 
"Ilinden." 
<H5>  Public Disqualification </H5>
  The Macedonians in Bulgaria for the first time, after many a 
year of persecution in Zivkov's ethnically "pure and 
homogeneous" state, publicly raised their voices in the cold and 
dramatic autumn of 1989. It happened at a mass meeting for 
democratic changes in the large square near the "Aleksandar 
Nevski" monument in Sofia. Among the hundreds of thousands of 
spectators there was a group of Macedonians who came with their 
own slogans as a sign of identification and to announce their 
struggle against the suppression of political rights. Soon 
afterwards OMO "Ilinden" was formed and its activities were 
stepped up. 
  However, in spite of the upsurge of democracy, the great 
waves of euphoria following the fall of Todor Zivkov and his 
police regime in Bulgaria at that time, and the feeling that a 
climate for real democratic resurrection was being created, the 
ranks of the nationalists were soon consolidated and the 
vrhovists organized the Alliance of Macedonian Associations 
(later on the VMRO-SMD [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Alliance of Macedonian Associations]), assisted by 
the frightened state leadership, started, as provokers and 
initiators, the whole battle against OMO "Ilinden." They began 
to organize counterdemonstrations, to deny the existence of the 
Macedonian national minority in Bulgaria, to humiliate the 
"Ilinden affiliates", and discredit them as "foreign 
mercenaries," "lost souls," and so on, all to prove that they 
were a small group of "renegades from the system." 
<H5>  Halting Assimilation </H5>
  OMO "Ilinden" did not suspend or abandon its goals despite 
the strong media and other public pressures. On the contrary: 
On 11 March 1990, over 100 Macedonians organized a march 
through the streets of Sofia and they handed a petition to the 
Bulgarian parliament with a request to end the assimilation of 
Macedonians and for the reestablishment of minority rights. 
Despite the fierce anti-Macedonian campaign launched in 
Bulgaria, only a month later OMO "Ilinden" organized a rally 
with around 15,000 Macedonians from Pirin Macedonia in the 
courtyard of the Rozen Monastery, marking the anniversary of 
Jane Sandanski's death. The rally ended without incident, but 
with straightforward demands for cultural independence and 
respect for human and minority rights, accompanied by Macedonian 
folksongs and dancing. 
  This demonstration at the Rozen Monastery eventually angered 
all the Bulgarians, from the ultra leftist to the ultra rightist 
parties and movements. The first consensus reached at that time 
between the hated communists and the new democratic forces was 
to suspend the Macedonian movement. Events unfolded this way: 
False accusations were made about the Macedonian organization, 
it could not be legally registered, its activities were then 
banned, and finally police batons were brought into play and 
every kind of demonstration was banned. In the meantime, 
members of OMO "Ilinden" went on hunger strike, wrote letters to 
foreign embassies and offices, and then directly addressed the 
Bulgarian leadership in July 1990 to insist they were not what 
they were accused of being -- separatists -- but were loyal 
citizens who were simply asking for the freedom to express their 
national identity. 
<H5>  Bloody Clash </H5>
  Instead of receiving understanding, the response to all this 
was that the OMO "Ilinden" activists had their passports 
confiscated, while some were arrested in December of the same 
year in Blagoevgrad, others were beaten up in the streets as 
they collected signatures for support, and so on. 
  Consequently, the traditional Rozen rally was banned in 
1991 and 1992, and there was a brutal, bloody clash between the 
police and the rally around the tomb of Jane Sandanski in April 
1993. 
  Last year's Rozen persecution, the latest in a series of 
anti- Macedonian activities, completed four years of the 
Bulgarian political leadership's attempts to suppress the 
Macedonian organization using the state's apparatus and 
organizations founded specially for the purpose, neither minding 
the means, nor economizing on money or words for propaganda, 
schemes, or actions in the field. 
  However, the truth about the assimilation of the Macedonians 
in Pirin Macedonia has become known, as well as the suppression 
of the Macedonian national minority in Bulgaria, and is to be 
found in all the reports of international associations. Now, 
the political trial of four OMO "Ilinden" leaders approaches. 
It is further proof of the continuing policy, contrary to all 
Bulgaria's declarations on its respect for human rights, the UN 
charter, the CSCE documents, Vienna.... It is naive to imagine 
that prison sentences will eliminate the existence of the 
Macedonian national minority. Unfortunately, Bulgaria has not 
learnt any lessons from history -- many Macedonians rotted in 
camps and jails for years and even decades, and yet there now 
come fresh generations that refuse to forget about their 
ancestors' national identity. 
  Is it not more rational, just for once, to accept the bitter 
truth in order to help the Balkans, during its transition into 
newly oriented states, to become a stable region liberated from 
its complex historical past. The borders remain, and that may 
be the strongest motive for the elimination of some inherited 
syndromes.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Vasic and S. Colakovski: "Party Boomerang: </F>
Youth on the Margins of Political Life"] 
  [Text] Does the formation of a new generation for the 
parties, immediately before the elections, mean that young 
people will only stick up election posters or serve as stage 
decoration in the electoral campaign? 
  To "those for whom the future waits," there is a feeling of 
disorientation, that the compass shows a constantly changing 
direction in the current social environment. It is reflected 
impressionably in political undertakings; young people do not 
eagerly attend our political gatherings. In the last election, 
not a single party considered them a serious part of the voting 
public. They were only -- literally only -- used by the parties 
with extremely nationalistic orientation. By the same token, 
their voice and considerations (isn't there a paradigm: youth 
means progress?) could be heard to the same extent that they 
would obtain in commitments. In the final analysis, it adds up 
to negligence. 
  In the domestic political atmosphere, only some parties 
formed their own political youth groups and, then, two years 
after the first multiparty election. First of all, it was done 
when the necessity of "fresh blood for the party" finally became 
clear and probably when the significance of the youth factor 
began to be seriously considered. What is perhaps symptomatic, 
everything that is happening now is precisely for encountering a 
new election. Up to now, young people were only one of the 
marginalized items in prescriptions in the party programs. 
Perhaps because of the already mentioned reasons, the political 
life this autumn, despite other distractions, also emphasized 
the trend of forming political youth groups in a few more 
parties. 
  Except for brief party announcements to the public about the 
formation of their youth groups, the public has had little way 
to discern young political activism. Perhaps, it was a matter of 
strictly controlled party secrets or because the youth groups 
existed only formally. 
<H5>  "We Are Not `Guerrillas'" </H5>
  How do all the political youth groups that currently exist 
on 
the Macedonian political scene work? The first parties that 
formed youth groups, approximately at the same time two years 
ago, were the SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia] 
with the Social Democratic Youth and the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal 
Macedonian Revolutionary Organization -- Democratic Party for 
Macedonian National Unity] with the Union of Youth Forces. 
During the next few months, the political ambience was enriched 
by another three youth groups: the Democratic Youth of the DP 
[Democratic Party], the Youth Forum of the PDP [Party for 
Democratic Prosperity], and the Liberal Youth Union of the LP 
[Liberal Party]. Generally, the organizational appointments of 
all the youth groups are arranged according to the model of the 
senior part of the respective party, and in every case, without 
exception, the primary people in the youth groups are 
incorporated in the leading body of the mother party. 
  We already mentioned that the SDMM [Social Democratic Youth 
of Macedonia] and the UMS [Union of Youth Forces] have had the 
longest period of existence. According to Toni Apostolovski, 
general secretary of the SDMM: "The Social Democratic Youth of 
Macedonia fundamentally acts in an independent manner. It 
clearly understands that fact and usually expresses its opinion 
on all the problems of young people. Through the speakers' 
platforms, which we often organize, we try to listen to the 
views of our members and, more broadly, those of young people. 
All the activities of the SDMM are financed by the party, and we 
have formed our own projects, but things have not worked as it 
should up to now." 
  While the young social democrats are proud of their 
international collaboration with foreign youth groups sharing 
similar origins, the extent of cooperation with youth groups 
from the other Macedonian parties is a different matter. The 
SDMM maintains that there is no concrete cooperation. The 
reasons were reflected in the political situation existing at 
the time of their formation and in the difference in attitudes 
the groups represented. In connection with the approaching 
election, it is said that the SDMM will participate in the 
development of the electoral campaign. A definite number of 
young people are expected to appear on the electoral lists, and 
Apostolovski concludes that, "considering the fact that the 
majority of our members are students, we are focusing on that 
part of the population in the approaching election." 
  Bearing in mind the current activeness of our political 
youth 
groups, one gets the impression that the Union of Youth Forces 
of the VMRO-DPMNE started out in a more organized way. "The UMS 
has autonomy in its work and a degree of financial 
independence," asserts Robert Ljusev, chairman of the UMS. 
According to him, unlike the other youth groups, those under age 
18 can become members of the UMS, but only those of legal age 
can commit themselves politically. 
  Frequently, the fan clubs of the "guerrillas" are identified 
with the youth group of the VMRO-DPMNE, however, Ljusev says 
that: "The `guerrillas' are something different. The UMSM 
[UMS-Macedonia] has no connection with them; it does not work 
with them. Some of the `guerrillas' are, however, members of our 
youth group. Sometimes, we have even tried to make an armistice 
between the `tripe-eaters' [ckembarite] and the `guerrillas,' 
but without success. I think it is a matter of an unhealthy 
rivalry between Skopje and Bitola." 
  In a subsequent conversation concerning his international 
contacts, the UMS chairman said that their basic goal is to join 
the European organization of right-wing-oriented youth groups of 
the political parties, DEMYS [Democratic Youth Community of 
Europe]. As far as cooperation with other political youth groups 
in Macedonia, the UMS thinks that it is at a correct level. They 
had made arrangements for their mutual debut with the SDMM at an 
international youth meeting that was held in Bulgaria where only 
the views of Macedonia's youth were represented. Finally, Ljusev 
explained the basic political strategy of the UMS: "from the 
members of our youth group, we will try to create an elite of 
skilled young cadres who will be educated abroad and will, in 
some future election, be the `thrusting needle' of the 
VMRO-DPMNE." 
<H5>  Juniors and Seniors </H5>
  The Democratic Youth of the DP, the Liberal Youth of the LP, 
and the Youth Forum of the PDP are political youth groups of a 
more recent vintage. Characteristic of them is the fact that 
they were established initially throughout the country, but up 
to now, they have lacked particular activeness. Nevertheless, 
they have announced a serious commitment to the approaching 
election. 
  "The function of the youth group is to assist the seniors, 
but we are independent in conveying the resolutions of the 
organization and its activities," says Vesna Jovanova, the 
general secretary of the Democratic Youth. "In our youth group, 
we will try to work in a decentralized manner, and the 
Coordinating Body is the highest organ. We have not had 
international contacts up to now, and probably will not 
implement any until the party makes [similar] ones. We expect a 
victory in the coming election, and that is the basis for our 
ever-increasing membership," Jovanova concludes optimistically. 
  The Youth Forum of the PDP was formed three months ago. The 
members of the Forum say that among young people there is the 
greatest interest in the organization. Drita Osmani, secretary 
of the Youth Forum, emphasizes: "We do not act independently, 
but only within the framework of the party. That means that we 
pursue the tasks which are already endorsed in the program. Up 
to now, we have been active only in the jurisdiction of the PDP 
in Opstina Centar [possibly Tetovo] where the initiative to form 
the Forum also arose. First of all, we will propose changes in 
the educational system, as well as for the eradication of the 
anomalies of life: drug adiction, prostitution, and alcoholism." 
  The youth group of the LP -- the Liberal Youth Union -- was 
established formally not quite 30 days ago. The Chairman of the 
Liberal Youth Union Andjelka Peeva tells us: "The initiative to 
form such a union already existed two years ago, but our 
appraisal was that for Macedonians, liberalism was still early 
and, therefore, our Initiative Committee attended international 
meetings of liberal youth groups in Europe and benefitted from 
their ideas and experiences in order to develop a program like 
the one the LUM now has." She continues: "The opstina committees 
do not currently operate as they should; we will have to work on 
that. We have some projects in mind, and sports days and media 
presentations to promote the message and to inform drug abusers 
that it is possible to live without drugs." 
  The formation of youth groups opens a new chapter in our 
political life. The necessity of rejuvenating party ranks is a 
customary practice in countries with much longer democratic 
traditions. When will it finally be understood that it is the 
parties that need young people, not the reverse? Does the 
formation of youth groups, coming immediately ahead of an 
election, mean that these young people will mainly serve by 
sticking up campaign posters or by providing stage decoration 
for the electoral campaign? Shortsightedness about domestic 
political supporters along those lines could, doubtlessly, come 
back like a boomerang!

<F P=106> [Article by V. Eftov: "Inflation Based on False </F>
Computations"] 
  [Text] According to the government, last year's 
inflation reached 240 percent, although the statisticians assess 
it at about 350 percent. What causes the disparity? Could an 
erroneous computation by the Republic Statistical Institute make 
the projections agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund 
questionable? Why is it that the increased cost of petroleum has 
not been included in the December inflation? As a result of this 
"gaffe," wage increases will be lower than they should have 
actually been. 
  We have learned that the government intends to demand 
officially that the Republic Statistical Institute correct its 
data on last year's price and inflation dynamics. On the eve of 
the new year's meeting with journalists, Institute Director 
Svetlana Antonovska, the Republic's leading statistician, made 
the data public. 
  Therefore, Crvenkovski's Cabinet was among those 
dissatisfied 
with the work of the statisticians. Naturally, it separated the 
government's dissatisfaction from the excessively gloomy 
statistical depiction of the situation and the dissatisfaction 
of the trade unions and the opposition, for instance, and the 
excessive embellishment of our reality as depicted in official 
statistical data. 
<H5>  Questionable Timing </H5>
  Essentially, what is the nature of the argument between the 
government and the statisticians? At the news conference we 
mentioned, director Antonovska said that last year retail prices 
(therefore, inflation) rose 349.8 percent. Unlike the 
statisticians, the calculations of the Ministry of Development 
indicate that the annual inflation was somewhere in the vicinity 
of 229.6 percent (the latest increase in petroleum products was 
not included, the reasons for which will be explained later). 
The gap between the inflation as computed by the ministry and 
the assessments made at the beginning of 1993 (an inflation of 
233 percent was anticipated) was minimal--1.2 percent. 
  The misunderstanding (let us avoid all sorts of stories and 
speak of the real differences in the interpretation of the 
facts, if possible!) lies in the timing in computing the 
dynamics of retail prices. Namely, the statisticians computed 
the dynamics of retail prices for the January-December 1993 
period in terms of January-December 1992. It is thus that they 
arrived at the figure of 349.8 percent increase. However, this 
is only an average annual increase in retail prices (throughout 
the world this is known as a deflator, which is subsequently 
applied in determining the level of the public product, in 
preparing the budget, and in computing the other macroeconomic 
figures) which includes the inflation carried over from 1992. 
Therefore, there can be no question whatsoever of an annual 
inflation, for in this specific case the computations should 
have covered the period through December 1993 in terms of 
December 1992, which would amount to 229.6 percent (which was 
the computation of the Ministry of Development). 
<H5>  Wages Affected </H5>
  However, this does not conclude the misunderstandings 
between 
the government and the Republic Statistical Institute. In 
computing retail prices for December, the statisticians did not 
take into consideration the latest increase in the price of 
petroleum products. This is quite strange, for the increase took 
place on the 13th of last month, while the inflation was 
computed for the period between 21 November and 20 December. 
Therefore, this did not include the direct impact of the price 
increases of gasoline (let us not mention the indirect impact, 
which will be included in computing the January and even the 
February inflation, which would be normal); the statisticians 
computed the December retail price increase at being 13.5 
percent. Unlike them, in its computations, which include the 
petroleum price increase, the Ministry of Development estimated 
that December prices rose by some 18.7 percent. Therefore, the 
computation of the pace of the annual inflation should be 
amended. The annual inflation, according to the computations of 
the Ministry of Development, should amount to about 244.7 
percent. 
  The noncomputation of the increase in the prices of 
petroleum 
products in the December computation of the increase in retail 
prices is of purely practical significance as well. On the one 
hand, instead of raising the December wages, in terms of wages 
in November, by about 20-21 percent (the actual increase in the 
cost of living), according to the data of the Republic 
Statistical Institute, wage increases should not exceed 15.7 
percent. It is true that the December lag will be somewhat 
compensated in determining the cost of living for January. 
However, it must be borne in mind that the January wages are 
subject to a different computation method compared to December. 
To be more specific: wages will be increased at a lesser 
percentage rate than actually required. 
  Naturally, the fact that increases in the price of petroleum 
products were not included in the computations to determine the 
December inflation will also question the government's 
projection concerning the dynamics of inflation in 1994. At the 
very beginning, one could project an increase in the planned 
inflation from 70 to approximately 80 percent. This will annul 
the heavy insistence of the government on ending the computation 
of prices by 20 December so that as the start of the new year no 
more drastic price increases will be expected. This will lower 
the growth of inflation (a scenario used by all governments who 
pledge to stabilize prices or launch an anti-inflation program). 
In the final account, the question arises of observing the 
limits agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund relative 
to inflation dynamics. 
  All in all, this entire matter can be characterized as an 
additional worsening of relations between the government and the 
Republic Statistical Institute, relations which, in the past as 
well, could not be considered satisfactory.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Special Feature -- The New Macedonian </F>
Credits and the Return of the Debts"] 
  [Text] 1) The first credit Macedonia received after its 
independence was the one from Mr. George Soros, last Winter, 
which totalled US$25 million. The credit was paid back within 
the set deadline, December, last year, and the interest was 
libor [London Interbank Offered Rate] + one percent point. Half 
of the credit was used to buy petrol, and the other half was 
given to the "Stopanska" and "Komercijalna" bank which marketed 
the funds to their customers. 
  2) The next loan was arranged with the International 
Monetary 
Fund (IMF), up to US$35 million, through a STF arrangement. The 
first half of these funds (US$17.5 million) will become 
available toward the middle of February, and the other US$17.5 
million, toward the middle of this year. The credit is 
conditioned with the adherence to the new stabilization program 
of the Government and certain conditions in the monetary and 
fiscal policy. The credit is disbursed for a 10 year period, a 
variable interest and a 4.5 year grace period. 
  As the Minister Without Portfolio Ljube Trpevski, otherwise 
responsible for contacts with the international organizations in 
the Macedonian Government, told MIC, the received sum is 
important, however, what is more important is that this STF 
arrangement with IMF presents a green light for negotiations 
with all other international finance institutions with which 
negotiations would otherwise progress very slowly. 
  The first part of the credit, which should be disbursed 
toward the middle of February, will be used to pay back the 
US$106 million debt to the World bank (IBRD). 
  3) Since Macedonia became a member of the International 
Development Agency (IDA) in December, it became possible to 
receive credits both from this agency and the IBRD, which IDA is 
part of. The total sum of the two credits amounts to US$80 
million. 
  The credit from IDA is intended for economic reconstruction 
(economic recovery loan) and totals US$40 million. It is to be 
paid back within 35 years, with a 10 year grace period, which 
means that the first installment will arrive in the year 2004. 
Beside this, the credit is without interest. 
  The credit from IBRD, on the other hand, is disbursed with a 
pay- back period of 25 years, with a 5 year grace period, and 
the interest is variable. 
  In view of the fact that the IDA credit is far more 
favorable, it will be the first to be used. US$32 million will 
be used to pay- back the old debt to IBRD, and the remaining 
US$48 million will be withdrawn in the following months. They 
will be used to support the balance-of-payment and the foreign 
currency reserves of the state. 
  The condition for the granting of these credits is the 
presentation of documents for the carried out imports of goods 
and services by Macedonia firms. Documents for the import of 
tobacco, machines for the processing of tobacco, jewelry, gold, 
valuables, nuclear materials, etc. can not be presented in order 
to fulfill the condition. 
  According to Mr. Trpevski, the Government already has 
sufficient documentation to immediately draw the first US$32 
million, and the documentation for the remaining sum of US$48 
million will not present a problem in view of the fact that the 
total Macedonian imports far exceed the sum of US$80 million. 
  These two credits have been accepted by the Government of 
Macedonia, and Parliament has also adopted a Law for the 
ratification of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia 
and IBRD. Now, when that is over, the World bank is expected to 
approve the credit on 8 February, and the first US$32 million 
will be able to be withdrawn upon the showing of the documents 
for the import of goods in Macedonia. 
  4) A new credit has been requested from Mr. George Soros, 
to the same amount as the previous -- US$25 million. The 
pay-back period for this credit is November 1994, in three 
installments, and the interest is libor + one percent point. 
  US$9 million will be used to pay-back the old debt to the 
World bank, and the rest will be withdrawn according to the 
needs. The Republic is not obliged to use the entire credit, 
but only if there is a need. 
  The Macedonian Parliament has already discussed this 
credit, and has decided to ratify the agreement between the 
Government and Mr. Soros. 
  5) A US$33 million credit has been received from the 
European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). A sum of US$27 
million will be used for the construction of a 400 KWH 
long-distance power line from the Mining-energetic combine 
"Bitola" to Skopje. 
  The remaining US$6 million will be put to use for the 
realization of projects from the government program for the 
saving and substitution of energy. 
  The credit is obtained with a pay-back period of 12 years 
and a 3 year grace period. The interest amounts to 7.5%, in 
average. 
  The recipient of the entire credit is the 
"Electrodistribution of Macedonia," whereby a part will be 
transferred to the Government, for its saving and substitution 
program, with an obligation to pay-back the same, which has 
simultaneously signed an agreement for guaranteeing the entire 
credit. 
  6) The Macedonian Government will soon mount new 
negotiations 
with the World bank, to obtain a new credit, which, according to 
the Government, is expected to total US$60 million, and would be 
intended for structural adjustment (structural adjustment loan). 
  US$40 million are planned to be received in 1994, intended 
for projects of infrastructural importance, such as help for the 
restructuring of the companies and the process of privatization, 
and partly, for the development of the communications East-West, 
or, more specifically, the road (or railroad) Drac (Albania) -- 
Istanbul (Turkey). 
  7) New negotiations with IMF for the reaching of a stand-by 
arrangement, for which conditions are more difficult to meet, 
and much stricter, are expected to begin in the period May-June. 
The stand-by arrangement is expected to be financially 
supported with a sum similar or exactly like the one of the STF 
arrangement, that is, approximately US$35 million. 
  8) As far as the commercial credits are concerned, the 
Turkish bank for foreign trade is offering a credit for the 
import of equipment and food from Turkey, valued at US$23-35 
million. The bank authorized for the setting of the matters and 
the gathering of recipients of this credit is "Komercijalna 
banka" from Skopje. Negotiations for this credit are still 
underway. 
  9) Beside all of this, the Government of the Republic of 
Macedonia plans to begin negotiations with the Paris club or the 
London club, during this year, for the regulation (eventual 
writing off or reprogramming) of the debts to these associations. 
  Connected with almost all these credits is the debt to the 
World bank, which is due for payback this month, and which 
amounts to US$106.6 million. 
  The financial construction of the funds for the pay-back of 
the debt is the following:

for the private creditors and the EIB and EUROFIMA.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Spring Sowing Uncertain"] </F>
  [Text] Food manufacturers announce, as early as now, a 
lack of finances for the spring sowing. The selective program, 
the previous sole source of finances for this and other 
agricultural activities, will definitely be abolished on March 
31. The approved finances by the National Bank of Macedonia -- 
a total of 140 million denars -- are aimed only for financing 
the production of corn. The stabilization program restrictions 
even more limit the possibilities of any additional sources. 
Thus, changes will have to be introduced in the plans for 
sowing of 218,140 hectares with rice, sugar beet, sunflower, and 
other products.

  [Text] The Democratic Action Party has sent a letter to 
diplomatic and consular representations in Belgrade requesting 
that they inform the governments of their countries about the 
latest events in Sandzak, so the "further arrests and 
persecution of Muslims would stop." The letter starts with the 
following words: 
  "Since 25 January of this year, Serbian-Montenegrin police 
have been making mass arrests of Muslims in the area of Sandzak 
and particularly in the Prijepolje, Rozaje, and Bijelo Polje 
communes. In most cases they are arresting the very top leaders 
of the of the Party of Democratic Action. This series of arrests 
started in Urozaje when a group of well-armed members of 
Montenegro MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] arrived in six 
Land Rovers, surrounded the house of the secretary for 
Montenegro, Mr. Rasim Sahman, and took him to some unknown 
location." 
  The letter further states that "despite all our attempts to 
learn the reasons for these arrests, the police authorities have 
not given us any explanation. In the aftermath of these events 
the tense situation in Sandzak has acquired dramatic 
proportions. By means of these and other similar actions, 
Serbian and Montenegrin authorities hope to intimidate the 
Muslim population and create pressure that would accelerate the 
process of their migration from Sandzak. The direct attack on 
the political representatives of Sandzak Muslims is designed to 
repress any form of political expression by these people."

  [Editorial Report] The 2 February issue of the Podgorica, 
Montenegro, daily POBJEDA on page 4 reports that an "original 
map of the so-called state of Sandzak" was found on members of 
the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] who had been arrested on 
charges of planning an armed rebellion in northern Montenegro. 
According to POBJEDA, the map was printed in the Republic of 
Croatia. The text accompanying the map, the paper notes, states 
that the borders of Sandzak were historically and 
internationally recognized by the decision of the Congress of 
Berlin and the Treaty of Constantinople. The "creators of this 
creation" specify that the state of Sandzak will cover over 
8,687 square kilometers and have a population of 440,000. Among 
the "propaganda material," POBJEDA adds, were brochures printed 
in Iran in Arabic. Pictures of fully equipped fighters in 
"combat poses" illustrated the text of these brochures. 
  According to POBJEDA, Harun Hadzic, president of the SDA for 
Montenegro, and Rifat Veskovic, president of the Bijelo Polje 
SDA municipal committee, were in possession of military staff 
and command organization plans when arrested. The paper adds 
that Hadzic and other SDA leaders had purchased 11 radio 
receivers in Germany and planned to conduct surveillance of the 
Yugoslav Army and police and to destroy communications lines and 
radio stations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Jovanovic, foreign minister of the </F>
FRY, by DJ News Agency; place and date not given: "We Are 
Expecting Mate Granic in Belgrade"] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Republic of Croatia and 
the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] have recently signed an 
agreement on the normalization of relations in Geneva. The 
agreement, apart from the opening of postal communications and 
roads, anticipates the opening of the FRY office in the Republic 
of Croatia and the office of the Republic of Croatia in the FRY 
on 15 February. Vladislav Jovanovic, FRY foreign minister, told 
DANAS his view of the new thawing process in Serb-Croat 
relations. 
  [DJ] What does the agreement mean for the signatories, the 
FRY and the Republic of Croatia, and what are its starting 
points? 
  [Jovanovic] It means a lot for both sides, as it obliges 
them, in resolving the problems that divide them, to employ 
political means, and take the peaceful way rather than use 
force, which is a great step forward. Moreover, this is a 
demonstration of the decisiveness to start the process of 
normalization of relations. Our mutual aim is to complete the 
process as soon as possible, but naturally it anticipates new 
realities, primarily the fact that this is the agreement on 
opening official representative offices, and not an agreement on 
establishing diplomatic relations or on mutual recognition. 
This is a step in that direction, and it is in our interest, at 
least in the interest of the FRY, to have the process continue, 
develop successfully, and lead to a full normalization of 
relations. 
  [DJ] What do you expect out of the agreement? 
  [Jovanovic] We expect this agreement to influence the 
establishment of a better atmosphere, the creation of conditions 
that will enable the issues yet to arise, political issues, to 
be solved in conditions of peace, and with the mutual wish to 
reach a political solution acceptable to both sides. In the 
beginning we will certainly have to solve the simpler issues, 
the humanitarian issues that were discussed in Geneva last 
Sunday, and in the initial stages of the activities of the 
offices a direct communication will be established, which we 
hope will make the transfer of information easier, and render a 
better understanding of positions, while at the same time serve 
as a very reliable channel of communication between the two 
governments. 
  At this moment our great common interest is that peace be 
achieved in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible. The fact 
that our positions and interests have become closer in this 
peace process has a positive meaning for the process. This 
channel of communication will, at least in the beginning, be 
used to encourage this peace process and to bring it to an end 
successfully. 
  [DJ] Some analysts in Serbia have interpreted the quoting of 
the CSCE and UN principles in the signed agreement -- where the 
inviolability of borders is mentioned, which implies that the 
"Krajina" is also part of the Republic of Croatia -- as direct 
recognition of the Republic of Croatia within its AVNOJ 
[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] 
borders. 
  [Jovanovic] There is no need to see in the agreement 
something that is not there. The agreement clearly states that 
it is an agreement between the two governments concerning the 
opening of offices, to make communication easier. It says 
nothing else. Since it limits its aim to what is said, it does 
not prejudice a single open issue, not only of the Krajina, but 
also of the division balance, mutual recognition, and even the 
establishment of full diplomatic relations. All this should 
happen when conditions are favorable. There have been instances 
in the past in which it was shown that the opening of an office 
in one country does not imply the recognition within the borders 
it aspires for. For instance, when the United States opened an 
office in China, that did not mean that the United States was 
acknowledging Taiwan as an indivisible part of China. The 
United States still has a different opinion from China's 
regarding its borders. Therefore, relations should not be 
unnecessarily complicated by showing wishes as reality, or 
rushing reality into assuming the form of the wishes. We must 
bear in mind the fact that the issue of the Krajina is connected 
to the Vance plan, which says that its political future, its 
final status, must be resolved through direct negotiations 
between the legitimate representatives of the Krajina and the 
Republic of Croatia. This is yet to happen, and with this 
agreement we have created favorable conditions for starting it. 
Before the negotiations take place, an absolute end should be 
put to all hostilities. After that the practical issues will be 
resolved, which will provide the conditions for starting 
political negotiations. This is reality; as it is, and not as 
someone would like to make it. 
  [DJ] As in Yugoslavia, this agreement was met with 
controversial opinions and interpretations in Croatia.... 
  [Jovanovic] Nothing that has not been done has been 
acknowledged, and nothing has been written that has not been 
said. Therefore, it is a matter of wishes and of the approach to 
a document -- interpreting it in one or another way, seeing 
various things in it. With much use of political imagination 
many things can be seen. After all, we live in the world of 
reality, and political imagination should be used more as an 
incentive for a constant mending of the world of reality than 
for replacing it with something illusory. It is natural to have 
criticism, suspicions, and reservations in both countries, which 
is probably the consequence of maximalist expectations and 
wishes, but the essence of this agreement is of a limited, 
modest scope. It is more important as a demonstration of 
political will and the decision of the two sides to start, in an 
organized way, toward full normalization of relations, which 
assumes the previous conclusion of peace, which is near. If it 
meant something else, then we would have nothing to deal with; 
all the problems would have been solved. Unfortunately, the 
agreement means nothing but a first step toward a real, normal 
situation, and establishing conditions for general cooperation 
between neighbors, which we hope will become reality one day. 
The sooner it does, the better it will be for both sides. 
  [DJ] What is your comment on Mr. Martic's being elected 
president of the "Krajina"? Is he someone who could make the 
political negotiations on the future of the "Krajina" and the 
Serb-Croat relations in general easier or more difficult? 
  [Jovanovic] Individuals can play a certain role in the 
development of political processes, but not a crucial one. The 
process will develop within the complex of the relevant 
elements, and individuals can only adjust these elements in a 
reasonably successful way. I do not know Mr. Martic personally, 
and know Mr. Babic only superficially. I think that they are 
both of the same generation, they have the same attachment to 
the Krajina, its political goals. I do not believe that there 
is a great difference between them; Mr. Martic is probably more 
composed and is probably able to control his emotions and nerves 
better. This is probably one of his advantages in negotiation 
processes with any side. According to what I know, he is a man 
of principle, a fanatic, and at the same time he is serious in 
conversation. I think that his nomination should not be taken 
as an additional difficulty in the negotiation process and the 
normalization of Croat-Serb relations. 
  [DJ] The European Community will consider the introduction 
of sanctions against the Republic of Croatia, on account of its 
alleged involvement in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Jovanovic] We do not support sanctions. The entire 
experience of recent history has shown that sanctions have 
created more problems than they have solved. This is best seen 
by the example of Yugoslavia. The sanctions were supposed to 
lead to peace in Bosnia, and they only lead to the escalation of 
war, and peace is further away than it was. They also caused 
destabilization -- not only in Yugoslavia, but in the wider 
area, and became the greatest obstacle to peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned, 
the fact is that the Serbs and Croats there had no significant 
dispute, or bitterness, to be more precise. To my knowledge, the 
conflicts had a relatively limited scope, and there was a great 
amount of mutual responsibility for the consequences of what 
they did to each other. This probably resulted in the 
preservation of mutual trust, and later served as the basis for 
their intra-Bosnian agreement on peace and cooperation. It is 
known that they have signed the declaration on stopping the war 
and establishing offices parallel with the signing of a similar 
statement by the FRY and the Republic of Croatia. This is in 
itself a positive fact in all-round Serb-Croat relations, which 
can have a constructive role on the entire territory of the 
former Yugoslavia, as well as help to find just final solutions 
to all the problems that the two most populous south Slavic 
nations share, and that complicate their relations and their 
lives. 
  [DJ] What is your comment on the controversies in the 
foreign policies of some European countries and the United 
States concerning the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, 
especially in Bosnia? 
  [Jovanovic] Relations between the United States and European 
countries are not too clear, nor can they be interpreted and 
placed in certain categories. There are many changes, and they 
alter position frequently, depending on the development of the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At this moment it seems that 
Europe cares more about peace in Bosnia than about keeping the 
sanctions. Italian minister Andreatta has recently said that 
the sanctions have turned out to be the main obstacle to peace. 
  [DJ] There is a thesis that weak Muslims are the aim of both 
Europe and the United States, and that by supporting Alija 
Izetbegovic's option the United States is in fact paying off its 
debt to the Islamic countries, and actually encouraging the 
Muslims to fight the war so that they can lose it. 
  [Jovanovic] The area for speculation is wide open. There 
is not enough substance for either statement, but there is 
enough space for various assumptions. What you have said is 
certain, the United States is trying to pay as much debt to the 
Islamic countries as possible through the Bosnian crisis, and it 
thus wishes to be rehabilitated in their eyes. On the other 
hand, it is in the interest of US politics to divert the 
attention of the Islamic world from the Middle East for a while, 
and draw it to Bosnia, so that Israel could freely reach a 
solution with the PLO that would suit it. These are U.S. 
strategic interests. Whether, apart from that, it has a 
strategic view of the so-called Muslim presence in Bosnia, 
whether it wants to make it weaker, if not destroy it, through 
this policy, or make it stronger and dominant, remains to be 
speculated on. 
  The theory of keeping the Muslims in Bosnia, or of 
repressing 
them, is not a theory we deal with, because it does not 
correspond to reality. We even think that it would be wrong if 
the politics of any country were to contain such a theory 
concerning the Bosnian crisis. 
  [DJ] How do you see the future of Serb-Croat relations? 
  [Jovanovic] It is too early to say. The fact is that we 
have started the process that increases the chances of there 
being mutual political visits and of actualizing political 
contacts in a direct way, and not, as until now, through 
mediators. This is the natural means that two countries wishing 
to settle their relations should employ in order to save time 
and to prevent foreign commissioners from organizing their 
relations. The upcoming visit of deputy prime minister Zeljko 
Simic to Zagreb is a step in that direction. This is a chance 
of viewing certain problems that will be brought up by either 
side, and it is difficult to say in advance what the plan for 
resolving them will be. After that foreign minister Mate Granic 
will probably visit Belgrade, and it is possible that there will 
be contacts of a different kind, perhaps at a higher level. 
  [DJ] Apart from the establishing of telephone lines between 
the Republic of Croatia and the FRY, the opening of the 
Zagreb-Belgrade highway was also announced. This road partly 
passes through a "Krajina"-controlled area? 
  [Jovanovic] As far as the opening of these communications is 
concerned, nothing can be done without the consent of the 
Krajina and without the Krajina consulting with the Republic of 
Croatia. I do not see the Krajina being a problem there. On 
the contrary, it has stated that it was prepared to cooperate 
with Croatia and Yugoslavia in the opening of these 
communications, and this, naturally, implies that both sides 
should benefit from it. This benefit is practical and material, 
as well as relating to property, which is an advantage of the 
policy of small steps, reminiscent as it is of the eternal truth 
that success feeds on success, and success in these relations 
should mean success for all sides, and not only for one. 
<H5>  [Box, p 17] </H5>
<H5>  Vladislav Jovanovic on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Statement </H5>
  Mr. Zhirinovskiy made a statement about air attacks to Serb 
positions in Bosnia being a declaration of war to Russia, and 
implying Russia's resignation from the UN, in his 
figurative-rhetorical style, probably to thus substantiate the 
fact that Russia, the Russian society, is not insensitive to 
what is happening in the Balkans, and that it is an area in 
which Russia has traditional interest, so it would be very 
sensitive to the drastic use of force against one of the nations 
that belong to the same Christian faith as the Russian people. 
This is the only way I see that statement, rather than as a 
literal description of reactions and the form of these 
reactions. Therefore, I see it as pointing out the well-known 
fact that any drastic use of force by a non-Balkan people would 
certainly cause a strong Russian reaction, and that this should 
be borne in mind before making inaccurate calculations. This is 
the way I took Mr. Zhirinovskiy's statement, and I hope that 
others have done the same.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Strikes Could Not Achieve Objective"] </F>
  [Text] The chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army, General 
Momcilo Perisic, stated yesterday that even the use of large 
contingents of air power would result in small gains. Thus, from 
the military point of view, the desired objective would not be 
achieved. 
  Commenting on the bombing threats yesterday on the Radio 
Kragujevac program "The Sign of the Times," Chief of Staff 
Perisic said: ``Since the makers of the so-called new world 
order have decided to finish everything on these Balkans 
territories without direct engagement of their troops, and since 
the scenario has somehow been developing slowly, while they are 
in a hurry, they now want to resolve the situation as soon as 
possible by using major forces from the air. 
  ``There are different opinions about this in the world, but 
I 
personally think that this is another threat designed to create 
pressure. However, if this were to happen, it would achieve 
meager results, and from the military standpoint it would not 
achieve the proposed objective. 
  ``The Western specialists are aware of this, and that is why 
there are opposing views in the world. Therefore I think that 
air attacks will not happen, but if they did, I believe the 
Serbs in the republic of Srpska, and particularly their military 
leadership, would be wise enough to avoid being hit. In other 
words, they would be wise enough to take up positions that would 
offer them maximum protection.'' 
  When he was asked to comment on the special FRY military 
units that allegedly are fighting in the republic of Srpska on 
the side of its army, the chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army 
said: 
  ``There is no organized transfer of Yugoslav military to the 
republic of Srpska, and it will not happen in the foreseeable 
future. I assert that not a single unit of the Yugoslav Army has 
gone there, nor is any unit fighting in the republic of Srpska 
or the republic of Serbian Krajina.''

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Radovanovic and Perica Vucinic: "`When the </F>
War Stops, We Will See Who Is Alive and Who Is Dead'"] 
  [Text] When Colonel General Momcilo Perisic, chief of the 
General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia [VJ], appeared on 
Television Serbia (the second daily newscast) on 29 December and 
spoke a few words about the Army of Yugoslavia and the tragedies 
which have befallen it (the events in Vranje and Danilovgrad), 
he certainly did not suspect that a few months later certain 
events which he appeared not to have recalled on that occasion 
would leak out to the public. 
  But then Miodrag Djeric emerged. His son Srdjan is one of 
two 
soldiers who, according to the official version delivered to the 
parents, died in the garrison in Subotica last May, which VREME 
wrote about in its last issue. There was no press release about 
that event, and Gen. Perisic skipped over it when he addressed 
the public. 
  On Tuesday, 18 January, POLITIKA published an obituary of 
Goran Galjak, a captain in the Army of Yugoslavia in the special 
forces who "was killed by enemy bullets on 27 December 1993." 
Officially, the Army of Yugoslavia never published a word about 
his having been killed. Unofficially, a story emerged in public 
about how Captain Galjak was killed in Bosnia (near Vogosca), 
and he was not alone. According to certain sources close to the 
Army of Yugoslavia, two days before Perisic was to be a guest on 
the TV news program and skip over stories of this kind, three 
other members of the special forces from here were killed near 
Vogosca, and three were missing. Other sources give other 
figures on the number killed (10 dead members of the Army of 
Yugoslavia), but the essence is the same--Capt. Goran Galjak and 
his comrades were killed in Bosnia. 
<H5>  The Legal Cover </H5>
  Aside from the general's forgetfulness and the absence of 
official press releases, there are two other facts that link the 
cases of Srdjan Djeric and Capt. Galjak. The first is that for 
months some people from the Srpska republic have been trying to 
convince Miodrag Djeric that his son is alive, that he fought on 
the other side of the Yugoslav border, was captured and then 
exchanged, and that he would soon return home. The other is much 
simpler. In both cases, the Army of Yugoslavia made a mess of it 
without having any very important need to do so. 
  There is a simple and effective legal cover for all the 
officers and men of the Army of Yugoslavia fighting in Bosnia. 
It is sufficient for them to be recorded in their own units as 
men who are, say, on annual vacation or on leave. The fact that 
during the 10 or 15 days they are officially absent they are on 
the battlefield as volunteers of the Army of the Srpska republic 
need not interest the Army of Yugoslavia at all, and, still more 
important, this allows it, again officially, to remain 
uninvolved in the events on Bosnian soil. 
  Although they have been nicely disguised, these absences are 
concealed in every possible way. An officer of the Army of 
Yugoslavia wounded in Bosnia says that he went to the 
battlefield voluntarily, that mainly regular army officers are 
involved where things are not going well, so that even closest 
relatives are not notified of the absences. In case of death, 
everything is reported as a "traffic accident." Our informant 
says that the thing in all of this that pains him the most is 
the phrase in obituaries--"killed in a traffic accident." "When 
I know they died a hero's death." 
  The answer to the question of why so much secrecy if the 
story is officially legal might be found in the fact that the 
Army of Yugoslavia has usually been involved in the thick of 
things, so that probably there has not even been time for all 
the necessary preparations. According to VREME's informants, 
that is why sometimes people go to the battlefield in uniforms 
of the Army of Yugoslavia with all the relevant insignia, even 
with the little metal canister around their neck with the 
soldier's name, rank, military specialty, and all other 
information written on waterproof paper. 
  The extent of this identification of its people becomes a 
problem for the Army of Yugoslavia only if one of them is 
captured. If he is killed, the body is extricated, and all the 
rest has already been described: a traffic accident, except in 
cases when the relatives obviously know what is going on, and 
the obituaries mention enemy bullets and defense of the Serbian 
cause. What is certainly not to the Army's credit is the fact 
that even then, when everything is already out in the open (but 
nevertheless can remain "covered"), even his own unit never 
publishes an obituary of the person killed. 
<H5>  Official Papers </H5>
  The Army displayed a still greater unprofessionalism, 
ineptness, and carelessness in the case of Srdjan Djeric. And it 
did so from the very outset if we assume the official version of 
the entire event to be accurate. (When the VREME reporter was in 
Subotica, people in Djevdjelijska Street, which runs along the 
perimeter of the exercise ground of the garrison there, told him 
that they remembered a thick column of smoke far inside the 
exercise ground and the military ambulances that quickly 
arrived.) 
  According to the official version, Private Srdjan Djeric and 
four of his comrades (none of them had at the time been in the 
Army more than 40 days) were in an armored combat vehicle [BOV] 
containing two Malyutkas, four Zoljas, 400 rounds for the 20-mm 
cannon, and 2,000 rounds for the 7.62-mm PKT machine gun. One of 
the soldiers (Sasa Boskovic, who later succumbed to his 
injuries) took the Zolja and caused the accident. 
  The Army, of course, never explained either to Srdjan's 
father or to anyone else what the BOV fully equipped for combat 
was doing on a training ground, nor what five young soldiers 
were doing in such a vehicle when not a single officer was 
present. The official papers say that on that day the Army had 
no combat alert whatsoever, but the instruction being given on 
the training ground was in tactical training referred to as 
"Operation of a Mechanized Squad in Preparation for March and 
Combat." Anyone who has been in the army knows that that 
exercise (and all others) is done without live ammunition. Nor 
does it sound very likely, as is stated in the "official record 
of the event," that at the moment when everything occurred 
Srdjan Djeric was actually showing his four comrades the 
vehicle's steering controls and interior. 
  The holes in the official communication might have been 
filled if the Army had admitted that at the time of the accident 
soldiers of the Srpska republic and the Serbian Republic Krajina 
were also training in the Subotica Garrison. 
  One soldier whom the VREME reporter came upon in Subotica 
during his visit to that city said that they (soldiers from the 
western Serbian areas) have not been there for at least the last 
three months (since November), but that they had been and that 
they were excellent comrades. 
  Certain other informants of VREME, military personnel, 
explain that the training of these soldiers is considerably 
shorter and is frequently done with live ammunition. In other 
words, Srdjan Djeric might have been on the training ground at 
the same time as his comrades from the krajinas. What in fact 
should not have happened is for the officers to be training him 
in the same way (with live ammunition), and still less not to be 
with him and his comrades in a combat-ready BOV. 
<H5>  Strange Disappearances </H5>
  The likelihood that all of this did nevertheless occur and 
that the Army simply wanted to cover up its own lapses seems 
much more likely than the possibility of someone having taken 
Srdjan to Bosnia from the garrison, or his having himself 
volunteered for some similar mission. A soldier who was our 
reporter's informant in Subotica rejects the second possibility 
and even says that "his people (the Army of Yugoslavia) would 
never have let him cross the Drina." 
  There are certain other details that also indicate a foolish 
cover-up. First of all, it seems that most of those involved in 
the entire case are no longer in the Subotica Garrison. The 
guards at the gate of the 1st Garrison in Subotica have not seen 
Capt. Milovan Kukolj, Djeric's commanding officer, pass through 
the gate for a long time now. Another officer, Capt. Vekic, "is 
somewhere in the field." A third officer, Major Radoslav 
Petrovic, is unable to state the whereabouts of the Privates 
Zoran Jovanovic, Davor Dralic, and Radomir Ilic, who according 
to the official documents were in the BOV at the time of the 
accident, nor the whereabouts of Sergeant Zoran Matovic, who 
marched the soldiers to the exercise ground. (Unofficially, 
Kukolj and Matovic are under investigation.) 
  In addition to all that, Maj. Petrovic even says that Srdjan 
Djeric was one of the best soldiers, while the unfortunate Sasa 
Boskovic, who fired the Zolja, "was immature." Presumably, he is 
thereby the only one to blame, case closed. All that is left is 
for people to swallow the whole story. 
  Unfortunately, the Army was unable to make this one wrong 
move and leave it at that. It went on to make another. The 
coffin which came to the house of Miodrag Djeric contained a 
body that did not correspond at all to the findings of the 
autopsy at the Military Medical Academy. Miodrag opened the 
grave, compared photographs and the findings with what he found, 
and held his head in both hands. In short, according to the 
findings of the autopsy, Srdjan Djeric's body was almost 
entirely charred (and Maj. Petrovic is unhesitating to the 
effect that "he saw with his own eyes--the body was burned and 
very little of it could be recognized"). Also, to be brief, the 
body which Miodrag Djeric dug up was not burned at all and 
possessed everything that did not exist in the autopsy 
findings--ribs, backbone, lungs, heart, internal organs, 
stomach.... 
<H5>  Ruzica Also Disappeared </H5>
  When he made this discovery, Miodrag Djeric wrote up a 
request for exhumation and has received no reply to this day. 
This kind of behavior on the part of military authorities would 
be very strange on the assumption that they are convinced that 
the assertions of Miodrag Djeric and five other witnesses who 
were present when the grave was opened and the comparison was 
made to the photographs from the autopsy are inaccurate. If they 
wanted to prove that people under stress saw something other 
than what was actually in that grave, they could have no easier 
way than exhumation. But if there has been a mistake (an 
accidental substitution of bodies at the Military Medical 
Academy), the case becomes more complicated, because an extra 
corpse has turned up in the whole story. From what training 
ground or battlefield did it reach the Military Medical Academy? 
That question would probably begin an altogether new tale. That, 
of course, should never have been grounds for not explaining to 
Miodrag Djeric in the calmest way, long before he came to the 
editors of VREME with his story, that what had happened was yet 
another stupid mistake, and for not thereupon sending him his 
son's body. 
  As though someone really wanted complications, and so they 
gave Miodrag his son's military record, in which there is no 
entry at all that he was killed. And they sent him two death 
notices. And summons to a trial in which Srdjan Djeric was 
supposed to appear in court as an injured party. And in all of 
this there emerges the mysterious Mrs. Ruzica Milanovic (VREME's 
reporters tried to find her in Mladenovac, but absolutely 
without success--she literally vanished), with her story about 
Miodrag's son being alive, and when the father asked that 
someone check it out, they told him in the police that they 
could not, because she "is not an unimportant person." And then 
they confirmed to Miodrag in the General Staff of the Army of 
Yugoslavia itself that our soldiers are going to Bosnia. And.... 
  Officials of the Army of Yugoslavia have promised that next 
week they will arrange a meeting of VREME newsmen with the 
people who worked on the case of Srdjan Djeric. Until then, the 
most accurate definition of everything that has happened to 
Miodrag Djeric and his son was furnished by Vukosava Bogisic, 
the records clerk in the Subotica records office, whom a VREME 
reporter asked about technical aspects of issuing death 
certificates. When she heard about the double death certificate, 
she departed from the context of explaining the technique of 
reporting a case of death, and said: "When the war stops, we 
will see who is alive and who is dead."

  [Excerpts] The unit commanded by Captain First Class Jovan 
Adamovic is one of the newly formed units in the Niksic 
[Montenegro] garrison. Its task is to secure the [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia] border with the neighboring republic of 
Srpska [Bosnia-Herzegovina], which is 150 kilometers long, and 
to train the soldiers it needs to carry out that assignment. We 
visited this unit in mid-November 1993 and discussed with its 
members the tasks they perform, work-related problems, and, of 
course, training as one of their key activities. 
  Captain Adamovic stressed: "This unit's most important duty 
is to prevent the spillover and expansion of the whirlwind of 
war from the former Bosnia- Herzegovina to the territory of 
Montenegro, i.e. the territory of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. We have carried out this task in its entirety. We 
have safeguarded peace and barred war profiteers, smugglers, and 
others engaged in murky and dirty businesses." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tugboats carrying the sign "You Are Not Alone -- 
Crete Is With You" have delivered 450 metric tons of 
humanitarian aid from Iraklion. Father Dimitrije Teodorus sent a 
message that the citizens of Crete will also send volunteers to 
help the Serbs if necessary. 
  As he delivered 20 tugboats containing more than 450 tons of 
humanitarian aid collected by the citizens of Crete for all the 
Serbian countries, Father Dimitrije Teodorus, representative of 
the archbishop of Crete, also delivered a message for all Serbs: 
"The brotherly Greek people will also help the Serbian people 
militarily it that becomes necessary." 
  "The citizens of Crete are with you, and in addition to the 
humanitarian aid, which will not be lacking, they are also ready 
to send manpower to help the Serbs in their just struggle, if 
the Serbs make such a request. Cretan citizens in that event 
would certainly be eager to join you and fight together; they 
are special people in Greece; they are ready to shed their blood 
for the Serbian motherland and Eastern Orthodoxy if you ask them 
to do so." 
  Stressing that he speaks for all Cretans, Father Dimitrije 
Teodorus, representative of the Greek Orthodox Church, pointed 
out that in addition to other firm bonds uniting the two 
friendly nations, Serbs and Greeks are also bound by the 
"unbreakable link of their common religion, which becomes ever 
firmer to withstand enemy forces when they become persistent, as 
they are now, in their desire to rupture Eastern Orthodoxy." 
  "I assure you," Teodorus said, "that the Greek nation shares 
these difficult times with you, they understand your conditions 
under these inhuman sanctions, and they see through the politics 
of the world's power brokers, who blame only the Serbs for the 
war in the region. You are not alone. Crete is with you." 
  Janis Papadakis, president of the Cretan delegation, 
otherwise dean of the University of Crete, reminded journalists 
that this is not the first time Crete had sent humanitarian aid 
to help the Serbs. Papadakis noted that "Only five days after 
the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] 
were introduced, we brought two tugboats of aid to Belgrade, and 
another four in August of last year; this is the third time we 
are meeting with the same people here in Belgrade. We will 
continue to supply humanitarian aid to the Serbs. Thus we will 
prove to everyone that we have understood from the first moment 
of the sanctions why the international community accuses only 
the Serbs of being responsible for all the problems in the 
former Yugoslavia, and we will show the international community 
that we do not agree with this biased position. 
  In addition to the aid, consisting of clothing, footwear, 
food, oranges (50 tons), and pharmaceutical products, the Crete 
representatives offered to FRY to receive the refugee children 
for three months, to be hosts to expatriates until the end of 
the war, and to adopt orphans from the Serbian lands upon mutual 
agreement. The journalists were informed that lraklion, which 
shipped the aid, plans to become a sister city of Novi Sad.

  [Text] A three-member board of judges of the District Court 
in Pec, presided over by Judge Dusan Micanovic, has pronounced 
Afrim Mehmeti (age 38), Gazmend Muhadjeri (age 34), Mehmed Lekaj 
(age 34), and Ibrahim Mehmeti (age 35), all from Pec, guilty of 
the criminal act of threatening the territorial integrity. Afrim 
Mehmeti was sentenced to five years, Gazmend Muhadjeri and 
Mehmed Lekaj to four years, and Ibrahim Mehmeti to three years 
of imprisonment. 
  During the proceedings, it was established that all of the 
accused, from April to the end of September 1993, carried out 
preparations for the secession of Kosovo and Metohija from the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. They proceeded from the 
assumption that the so-called Kacanik assembly, in declaring the 
"Republic of Kosovo," had created the legal conditions for the 
secession of Kosovo and Metohija from Yugoslavia. It was 
established that the accused started forming illegal 
paramilitary bodies and prepared the founding of paramilitary 
units. The hostile group received instructions from the illegal 
republic defense headquarters which acts within the framework of 
the ministry of def ense of the "Republic of Kosovo." The group 
intended to start armed action at an appropriate time and to 
have Kosovo and Metohija secede by force from Yugoslavia. 
According to information from the so-called republic 
headquarters, the accused Afrim Mehmeti was appointed the 
commander of the headquarters in Pec, and Muhadjeri and Lekaj 
were appointed his deputies. One of the aforementioned deputies 
was tasked with military action on rear lines and the other with 
security. The fourth acccused, Ibrahim Mehmeti, had the specific 
duty of finding reliable people for forming paramilitary units 
in local communities.

Kosovksa Mitrovica"] 
  [Excerpt] The republic market inspectorate closed down 24 
private stores in Kosovska Mitrovica [Kosovo] for violating the 
regulations of the new economic program. According to Stojan 
Zdravkovic, chief republic market inspector, the official 
exchange rate prescribed by the National Bank of Yugoslavia was 
not respected. 
  "The new dinar was worth much less there than the German 
mark, so the products were mostly purchased with foreign 
currency because the prices set in new dinars were much less 
favorable. Because of this great difference and the disregard of 
the established parity, we were forced to close down these 
stores," Zdravkovic explained. 
  The disrespect of the measures of the new economic program, 
according to Zdravkovic, has been most pronounced in Kosovo and 
Metohija thus far. In the remaining parts of the republic, 
private and especially state enterprises have been accepting the 
new conditions of business operations and adapting to the 
measures dictated by the anti-inflation program. 
  The market inspectorate in Belgrade has also been operating 
at full speed. 
  "Irregularities and disrespect of regulations have always 
existed, and naturally they exist now too. However, almost 
everyone has been respecting the prices prescribed and the new 
exchange rate. Firms were closed down in recent days, but mostly 
because the merchants did not have the proper accompanying 
documents for certain goods," Miodrag Nikolic, chief city market 
inspector said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dragoljub Vukovic: "Montenegrinhood Virus </F>
Activated"] 
  [Text] At the recent extraordinary session of the Peoples' 
Party of Montenegro in Kotor, the amendment to the statute, 
which was supposed to emphasize the Serbian dimension of the 
party, was not passed. In connection with this precise 
amendment, a senior party official, Vice President Dr. Bozidar 
Bojovic, remarked that the excessive display of Serbian 
sentiments has done more harm than good to the party. Not long 
after this, a split within the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] of 
Montenegro, the second strongest Serbian party in the republic, 
unexpectedly took place when a group of three federal deputies 
(Dusan Boskovic, Radovan Vukcevic, and Slavoljub Scekic) 
renounced their loyalty to Dr. Vojislav Seselj [head of the SRS 
in Serbia] and opposed the decision to make the SRS "unitarian," 
thus negating the autonomy of the Radicals in Montenegro. This 
opposition has been portrayed as defense of "the honorable state 
of Montenegro," to which the untouchable leader of the Serbian 
Radicals responded with an accusation that those who were until 
recently his assistants have verged toward "Montenegrin 
separatists." 
  Under the leadership of Dr. Novak Kilibarda, who has proved 
to be a much more skillful politician than many thought, the 
Peoples' Party of Montenegro has been suspected of 
insufficiently emphasizing its Serbian nature and not showing 
enough concern for Serbian interests on several occasions. It 
has transpired, however, that those who left the party because 
of these suspicions and formed new ones, have done a service to 
Dr. Kilibarda and his "populists [members of the Peoples' 
party]" and condemned themselves to the political wilderness. 
Without abandoning the realm of the national, Dr. Kilibarda, 
with the support of younger and more emancipated people around 
him, has tried (and to a great extent succeeded) to spare the 
Peoples' Party of being the exporter of Serbianity to 
Montenegro. Unlike some others, "the populists," have realized 
that there is no great number of Serbs in Montenegro who would, 
in place of their Montenegrin caps, stick a Serbian cap 
[sajkaca] on their heads. Even though they do not accept the 
Montenegrins as a separate nation, their support for the 
preservation of the Montenegrin state's integrity within the 
federal association with Serbia (and other Serbian lands) makes 
them a potential partner of those political forces in Montenegro 
that care about this statehood, too, but add national autonomy 
of the Montenegrins to it. The very fact that the Peoples' 
Party of Montenegro does not question Montenegro being a state 
("with Serbia always, under Serbia never") points to the 
acknowledgement of a special Montenegrin political subjectivity, 
independently of whether a clear idea about this exists with 
"the populists" or not. For the Serbian nationalists, prone to 
unitarist ideas and amalgamation, such a Peoples' Party is 
potentially "separatist" and their side uses the slightest hint 
of proximity between "the populists" and the Liberal Alliance to 
produce direct or indirect accusations in this sense. 
  Speaking of the Peoples' Party of Montenegro attempts to 
emancipate itself from romantic and rudimentary nationalism and 
emphasize its democratic and civic traits, it is also worth 
bearing in mind that its leaders wish to place the party within 
the framework of Western political culture. "Gentlemen, there 
is an association of the democratic parties of the world, or 
rather of the Euro-American civilization, and many parties tried 
to profile themselves so that they could enter this association 
in as inconspicuous a manner as possible. Because when one 
joins, you know, one wins many favors," Dr. Kilibarda emphasized 
at the party convention in Kotor. 
  Unlike the Peoples' Party, which had the hallmark of an 
authentic Montenegrin display of Serbian sentiments from the 
outset, the SRS entered Montenegrin territory as an echo of 
Seselj's nationalist and chauvinist uproar, and has more or less 
remained at this political level. 
  Suddenly, the unexpected unity has given way to discord, 
while the loyalty to Dr. Vojislav Seselj has transformed itself 
into accusations about dictatorship and the like. When Milika 
Dacevic, better known as Ceko, whom Seselj had made a war lord 
and then stripped him of the function, introduced him to the 
Federal Parliament and then chased him out, says: "We are not 
peasant Serbs from Serbia, we are Serbs from Montenegro," then 
it is not improper to conclude that the incubation period of the 
Montenegrinhood virus is over even among some Radicals. It may 
be true what Vojislav Seselj has been saying about Boskovic, 
Vukcevic, and Scekic, namely, that they turned against him 
because he dismissed them as not capable enough; however, the 
seriousness of the warnings by Dusan Boskovic about the risks of 
a policy that ignores Montenegro's specific status cannot be 
overlooked. 
  Departing from the assumption that one can equally display 
Montenegrin and Serbian sentiments in Montenegro, based on the 
example of the Peoples' Party and the SRS, one can conclude that 
it is more difficult for the Serbian political parties to 
resolve this paradox than for the Montenegrin ones. The 
political parties that do not question the ethnic specifics of 
the Montenegrins naturally also appear as the firmest guarantors 
of Montengrin statehood. Their dilemma can only be: Should the 
state be independent or integrated in a sort of border 
community. The Serbian political parties, however, are torn 
between Serbian integrationist tendencies and a Montenegrin 
specificity that they cannot circumvent. Their defense of 
statehood can be sincere, but it lacks sufficient basis, while 
their blatant negation of this statehood is plunging them from 
the heights of Mt. Lovcen among "the common" Serbs, to which 
most of them would agree only with difficulty. However, by 
staying at these heights, regardless of the fact that they might 
nationally feel Serbian, they are subconsciously becoming 
Montenegrins in a political sense.

rebellion in northern Montenegrin municipalities and to create a 
so-called state of Sandzak have been slowly reaching the public. 
They all indicate that the key player was Harun Hadzic, 
president of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) for Montenegro 
and vice president of this party for Sandzak. However, his 
closest collaborators, who were assigned subversive-terrorist 
activities, are of no less importance. 
  Thus, Isad Skenderovic, a 29-year-old biology teacher by 
training from Berane, commander of the security sevice for this 
municipality, had one of the more important roles in the plan to 
organize an armed rebellion. He already went far ahead in 
performing his task and formed terrorist groups and a crisis 
headquarters for operations in a state of war. 
  According to the most recent findings of the investigation, 
Isad Skenderovic, together with Hamdija Latic and Muarem 
Skrijelj and an additional 80 persons of Muslim nationality from 
northern Montenegrin municipalities, completed a 
subversive-terrorist course in the Turkish town of Urla. The 
training was conducted by Turkish officers to whom the students 
gave information on locations and organizations of airfields, a 
weapons factory, military barracks, and other significant 
facilities in Montengro and Serbia. After the completion of the 
course, Skenderovic was paid 5,000 German marks in cash for the 
construction of dugouts for the storage of weapons, food, and 
people. 
  According to the statements given during the investigation, 
the training in the Turkish army was very specialized and 
rigorous. It started with the taking of an oath in which the 
terrorists vowed to liquidate without mercy those persons in 
their ranks who were hesitant. Groups of three men, dressed in 
special uniforms, were tasked with tailing and, in the event of 
an immediate danger of war, liquidating prominent personalities 
in northern Montenegrin municipalities. The investigation 
further showed that they planned to destroy bridges and block 
roads, and that, what is most important, they wanted through 
these actions to draw the attention of the West to the allegedly 
threatened position of the Muslims in Yugoslavia. 
  Otherwise, it has been learned that 10 more people from the 
Pljevlja and Rozaje region were imprisoned yesterday and today. 
It has also been learned that the public prosecutor will submit 
a request tomorrow to conduct an investigation of them.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Vico: "How To Salvage the Fleet"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Montenegro Prime Minister Mile Djukanovic, 
opening a two-day conference on the prospects of the 
shipbuilding, repair, and servicing industry in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] organized by the Veljko Vlahovic 
Shipyard in Bijela, Montenegro, within the framework of this 
year's Mimosa Festival, spoke on the resources available to the 
Montenegrin maritime trade sector and on government measures to 
safeguard that industry under the conditions of sanctions. 
  Djukanovic said: "The following data speak about the 
significance and the prospects of the maritime trade industry of 
Montenegro: a port cargo handling capacity of about five million 
tons, a repair capacity of 80 to 100 ships annually, a fleet 
consisting of 37 ships with about one million tons displacement, 
5,200 workers -- 5 percent of the total number of employed in 
the republic. Participation in maritime trade accounts for 17 
percent of the GNP of the republic and 20 percent of total 
foreign exchange income. 
  Projects planned for the development of maritime trade were 
halted with the introduction of sanctions by the UN Security 
Council. Sanctions did not affect any other sector of the 
economy to such a degree as they did maritime trade. They 
brought into question its very survival. Direct damage from the 
sanctions to the maritime trade enterprises of Montenegro has 
been assessed at $220 million. The republic government, together 
with the federal government, is undertaking measures to 
safeguard existing capacities during the sanctions, i.e., to 
activate them as successfully as possible after the sanctions 
are lifted. [passage omitted] 
  This is why, with the help of the federal government and the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia, $45 million have been earmarked for 
that purpose. These funds have saved the ships from 
foreclosure." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Radovan Kovacevic: "For How Long Are the </F>
Lilies Capable of Fighting?"] 
  [Text] In the presence of Yasushi Akashi, newly appointed 
UNPROFOR chief in Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic sent yet another 
resolute message to the world: "There will be no peace until 
the conditions for a fair agreement are created!" That 
presupposes considerable territorial concessions on the part of 
the Serbian side, as well as the accesses to Sava River and the 
sea. Otherwise the tedious (and futile) series of Geneva talks 
will be continued, while the melancholy of the West will deepen 
even more. At the same time in the West, given some honorable 
exceptions, officials are hoping that the Muslim troops, after a 
successful final duel with the Croats in Mostar and central 
Bosnia, may make a turning point in the struggle against the 
Serbs. 
  In that context it seems as if it is increasingly to be 
believed that there is a readiness of the "lilies" to continue 
the war, which, according to some statements by the top Muslim 
officials, might last for many years. "We can rely only upon 
our army," Izetbegovic repeats, encouraged by the support of the 
United States, whose attitude is that the war has to do with the 
legitimate defense of Bosnian sovereignty, whereby the Serbs, 
and later the Croats, are defined as the aggressors. 
<H5>  "Divisions" and Heroes </H5>
  But how great is the military force of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the official name of the Muslim army? 
Estimates about this are being made in the Serbian republic on 
the basis of data collected by the intelligence service, 
particularly after some statements made by the Muslim 
leadership, such as Izetbegovic's latest, claiming that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has at its disposal 200,000 excellent 
fighters. Most of the chroniclers of the Bosnian war reject 
that figure as exaggerated. The refusal to comment by the 
generals of the army of the Serbian republic is explained by 
their caution -- "our enemy should not know how much we know 
about him!" 
  Still, it is known that the "lilies" are organized in six 
corps, one of which is completely engaged in clashes with forces 
loyal to Fikret Abdic in the autonomous province of western 
Bosnia. 
  We still remember the time when around 100 units organized 
themselves in the Patriotic League, or Green Berets, while 
various crisis staffs tried to organize them into army 
formations. Those units glamorized themselves by giving 
themselves names such as "Handzar" [the World War II Muslim unit 
under Ustasha command], "Smail Aga Cengic" [an Ottoman lord of 
the Bosnian origin], and so forth, while the staffs of 
"divisions" and "regiments" were highly improvised. In the 
course of time such a sort of combative optimism evaporated, so 
that those formations finally became organized into brigades, 
whose commanders were usually the local gazijas (heroes), while 
only in the third phase was there a desperate search for 
educated officers from the former Yugoslav People's Army. The 
initial mishaps and failures of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have 
been ascribed to the "underground" activities of the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] at the time when Tudjman and Izetbegovic 
were allies, while recently also to treason on the part of 
former chief of the General Staff Sefer Halilovic, who was first 
suspended, and now is expecting to be brought to trial. 
  Basically, each corps of "lilies" has six brigades. For a 
long time they were quite small and weak, some of them hardly 
coming up to the force of a battalion, but now, these brigades 
are up to 2,000 men each. The corps are in charge of the 
defense of the territory, which has already become quite reduced 
in size, where the majority of communications have been 
destroyed (or disconnected), so that the possibility of maneuver 
on the front is very limited, and particularly the possibility 
of penetrating further into the territory. 
  It is believed that, after several successive mobilizations, 
the Muslim army has at most 100,000 men under arms. 
  A considerable help to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is the 
support of volunteers and hirelings from Afghanistan, Pakistan, 
Iran, Turkey, and some other Islamic countries, whose evil 
temper the Croats in central Bosnia have best experienced on 
their own skin. According to some data there are around 8,000 
such volunteers. There are many conflicting reports about the 
combat skills of those fighters, but every witness agrees that 
blood-thirstiness is their general characteristic. 
  For a long time the Muslim army [the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina] was relatively poorly armed. Its average 
was strengthened by the HVO's arsenal involving more than 230 
tanks and 350 guns of various calibers, most of them captured at 
the beginning of the war, during the raid on Novi Travnik. 
There, in the Bratstvo [Brotherhood] factory, several thousands 
mortars, multiple rocket launchers, and other weapons of that 
kind were stored, ready to be exported.... However, with the 
collapse of the alliance, the Muslim side found itself without 
any tanks. For a long time the shortage of ammunition was also 
quite perceptible. 
  Still, the shipments from the Islamic countries that arrived 
at the ports of Ploce, Metkovic, and Split in the first half of 
the last year considerably improved the arsenal of the Muslim 
army. Furthermore, the weapons that are still coming in under 
the cloak of humanitarian aid are also vital for the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Despite the arms embargo, in a short 
time the Muslim side also obtained six transport helicopters. 
The Serbian and Croatian army staffs very often complain to the 
blue helmets that the AWACS planes are often turning a blind eye 
to this, while instantly reacting to every take-off of Serbian 
or Croatian aircraft. 
<H5>  The Overestimated Favorite of the West </H5>
  Finally, one must not forget about the very powerful 
military-industrial complex that the SFRY built up in central 
Bosnia. The Bratstvo factory in Novi Travnik fell into Muslim 
hands with minor damage to the plant, so that the production of 
ordnance, although rather reduced, has continued. Still, the 
Muslims lack shells, which were manufactured in Vogosca (under 
the Serb control), percussion caps [kapisle] produced in Gorazde 
(now with the status of a UN protection zone, but without any 
communications because of its encirclement by the Serb forces), 
and gunpowder and explosives from Vitez, where fierce clashes 
are still going on.... One would say that the Muslim army has 
plenty of weapons, and even ammunition, but the infrastructure 
is insufficient, while the conditions for servicing are even 
worse.... On the other hand, according to witnesses, the army 
of the "lilies" [reference to the flag of Bosnia-Herzegovina] is 
becoming ever better organized, while its fighters are 
increasingly yielding to the influence of the fanatical 
supporters of holy war. 
  In the West the recent reports (CIA) that are coming in 
express the belief, probably on the grounds of the continuous 
Muslim successes in the fighting against the Croats in Bosnia 
and in parts of Herzegovina, that the Muslim army is capable of 
taking the strategic initiative along the entire front as early 
as now. It seems, however, that Western analysts are still 
overestimating the strength and combat readiness of its 
favorite, pushing the entire Muslim people into a catastrophe, 
as Radovan Karadzic put it recently. 
  It appears that more objective is the view that the Serbian 
republic army should not wait for the announced Muslim spring 
offensive to come into full swing. The General Staff of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is certainly analyzing the possible 
situation in which the "lilies" would have to fight on two 
fronts. After the recently called mobilization, that, for the 
time being, has only a preventive character, the Bosnian Serbs 
might create conditions for a reactivation of potentials that 
have been hitherto held in reserve, which considerably shortens 
the way to a counteroffensive. Is there any alternative way out? 
  The inevitability of a peaceful settlement imposes itself as 
an answer to that question. Another answer is perhaps to be 
found in certain geopolitical theories, that suggest that by 
encouraging Izetbegovic the West is actually pushing him toward 
the abyss. Because Europe does not want the seed of Islamic 
fundamentalism on its soil....

boasted that the "Russian bomb" had already been tested at 
Brcko, where "13 Muslims were killed in the experiment."

<F P=106> [Article by Uros Komlenovic: "Mobilization: Inexpensive </F>
Heads of Refugees"] 
  [Text] In Serbia these days the constant fear that Bosnian 
refugees of military age have of the long hand of the fatherland 
has grown into panic. Potential fighting men are receiving draft 
calls in which the Defense Ministry of the Srpska republic 
reminds them that they are the descendants of the glorious 
defenders of their people and their land and that it is now 
their turn to do their patriotic duty. In short, to report 
immediately to the military section, district, or garrison in, 
say, Zajecar, Smederevo, or Belgrade to perform service in the 
Army of the Srpska republic. 
  There is no explanation of the surprising detail that 
Zajecar, Novi Pazar, and Belgrade are located in the Republic of 
Serbia, but on the other hand the reverse of the draft notice 
contains detailed instructions about how many sets of 
undershorts, socks, undershirts, and towels the draftee should 
bring with him. Fascinating advice is given that they should 
report to the police or military officers IMMEDIATELY those who 
hinder them from fulfilling their patriotic duty (mothers, 
sisters, girl friends, wives, friends, pacifist organizations?), 
but that there is no need to interrupt their trip for that 
reason and lose time. It concludes with the warning in capital 
letters: "In case of failure to report, police authorities will 
apprehend the draftees and charges will be filed." They do not 
say what police will apprehend Karadzic's recalcitrant subjects, 
but it can be assumed that it would be Sokolovic's people. 
Concluding that the president of Montenegro has truly earned the 
right to wear Karadzic's medal, VREME's correspondent in 
Podgorica, Velizar Brajovic, reports that the situation is 
similar in that republic, where the Social Democratic Party 
[SDP] has publicly opposed the practice of doing all this, which 
is moreover being done with the knowledge and approval of the 
government. 
<H5>  Delivery </H5>
  It is of interest that the draft notices are being 
distributed in refugee camps by teams made up of officers of the 
Army of Yugoslavia, people from opstina defense secretariats, 
and the military police, accompanied by a warning that those who 
refuse to sign will lose refugee status and will be crammed into 
a military prison before they are sent across the Drina. Short 
and clear, accompanied by a warning that there is an agreement 
between the Army of the Srpska republic and the Army of 
Yugoslavia and that answers to all questions can be found in the 
Srpska republic, whose medical and social welfare agencies will 
resolve any possible problems. In other words--the FRY is only 
delivering, while the Srpska republic is deciding. 
  Nothing easier, of course, than to get to people tired of 
living in refugee camps, but neither have those who have found 
private refuge been forgotten. Draft notices from opstina 
military sections are arriving at their addresses. If someone 
makes a mistake and comes in for a conversation, the opstina 
official presents him the "picture postcard" from the 
fatherland, accompanied by the threats we have already 
mentioned. Those receiving the draft notices are terribly 
uninformed: Some people have reported to the Red Cross, but not 
to the police, and there have been some who have not reported to 
anyone. It is not just the "humanitarian" nature of the Red 
Cross here that has been confirmed, then, but also the tradition 
of reporting those around it "to the proper authorities." The 
appearance of uniformed people bearing the insignia of the 
Military Police of the Army of the Srpska republic in Novi Sad 
suggests the conclusion that no one is taking great pains to 
disguise the joint effort. Judging by its scale, that would not 
have been possible anyway. 
<H5>  The Law </H5>
  The people manning the hot line for victims of 
discrimination 
say that this is a violation of international documents on human 
rights and rights of refugees. The Human Rights Council of the 
Center for Antiwar Efforts (which operates the hot line) took 
the initiative the other day for an assessment of the 
constitutionality of the republic Law on Refugees. 
  "Article 2 of that law, which was adopted in April 1992, 
states that refugees are subject to military and labor 
conscription under the same conditions as citizens of the 
Republic of Serbia," says Biljana Kovacevic-Vuco, an attorney in 
the Human Rights Council. "The republic Law on Refugees, then, 
is contrary to the federal Law on the Army, which states that 
only citizens of the FRY are subject to military conscription." 
  The problem, however, is that the courts here have remained 
loyal to the advice of the late marshal that there is no need to 
"hold to the law as a drunk man holds onto a fence," so that 
refugees subject to the military obligation of the Srpska 
republic who have no liking for the possibility of losing their 
heads in some ravine can only heed the advice of the High 
Commissariat for Refugees of the United Nations in Belgrade: 
"Hide." 
<H5>  Total War </H5>
  A new wave of mobilization was for that matter to be 
expected 
after Karadzic's threat that unless the Muslims sign the peace 
plan, he will wage total war. The announcement of amnesty for 
deserters of the Srpska republic who put on the uniform before 
10 February and news about Mladic's muffled grumbling that 
recently the Serbs have not managed to move the line of the 
front were reminders of the constant problem of Serbian units in 
Bosnia--the shortage of "cannon fodder." The Serbs, to be sure, 
still have a significant superiority in armament, but all that 
military equipment is useless if there is no one to operate it. 
On all the fronts in Bosnia, the Serbs are numerically weaker 
than the Muslims. In Sarajevo, for example, the Army of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, on their own admission, have about 48,000 men 
at their disposition, while the number of Serbs in the 
surrounding hills is a fraction of that. It is not possible to 
carry out the announced Serbian offensive which is supposed to 
compel the Muslims to sign some document with the present 
personnel, so that Karadzic has probably asked Belgrade for 
help. Aware that the Army of Yugoslavia does not dare for the 
present to become openly involved on the Bosnian battlefield, 
Milosevic seems to have offered his protege an inexpensive and 
worthwhile gift--the heads of the refugees. 
  No one, of course, knows the details of the agreement 
between 
the Army of Yugoslavia and the Army of the Srpska republic, but 
it has been clear for a long time that Milosevic's and 
Karadzic's territorial priorities in Bosnia differ. The 
president of Serbia wants to "cleanse" the Muslim enclave on the 
Drina in order to expand the security zone westward, while 
Karadzic's political destiny is bound up with Sarajevo--choosing 
Banjaluka as the capital of the state of the Bosnian Serbs would 
drastically limit his power, and Pale is only a temporary 
solution. Milosevic and Karadzic have obviously agreed to strike 
from both sides. 
  Aside from the fronts we have mentioned, Mladic probably is 
trying to reinforce his lines around Olovo (cutting the road 
between Zenica and Tuzla, in which paratroopers from Nis, 
according to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] reports, are taking 
part) and Modrica (a preventive attempt to isolate Tuzla in case 
the airport should be opened). Accordingly, there are places 
tailor-made for getting killed. All that is needed is to find 
enough people. For the present, the refugees are the first 
target, and because it is certain that the number apprehended 
will not be sufficient for operations on that scale (the 
Bosnians move around a lot), citizens of Serbia and Montenegro 
who have FRY citizenship, but the misfortune of being born west 
of the Drina, may soon find themselves in danger. In Croatia, 
which recently became an ally, such moves are not uncommon 
anyway, and confirmation is offered by the case of Viktor 
Ivancic, FERAL TRIBJUN editor, about which VREME has written. 
The regimes in Belgrade and Zagreb have a common interest in 
Bosnia, and so they are resorting to similar methods. Those with 
a malicious tongue would say that there is an obvious 
coincidence of character here as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Zoran Jelicic: "Economic Chaos: Three </F>
Governments, Two Dinars, One Illusion"] 
  [Text] It will be a big and pleasant surprise if it 
turns out that collecting foreign exchange from the citizens and 
the economy is not the main goal of the new economic policy. 
  At the beginning of next week, the new dinar will be put 
into 
circulation, even though there is little chance that the 
dilemmas surrounding the question of how the economy will 
function with two domestic currencies will be resolved by then. 
Since last Wednesday, SLUZBENI LIST has probably been one of the 
most sought-after commodities, since that is where the federal 
government's decree on the new dinar was published. However, the 
decree in question is only the beginning of the dilemmas. 
  The federal government has introduced the new dinar as a 
means of payment in the territory of the FRY [Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia], but the old, existing dinar has also been 
preserved. The new dinar is divided into 100 paras and can be 
exchanged for foreign currency, while the National Bank will use 
its previous mechanism to determine the relationship between the 
new and old dinar--although we are not allowed to exchange the 
old dinar for the new one, and thus not for foreign currency 
either. Everyone who is obligated to keep business records is 
obligated to indicate their status in new dinars (the 
recalculation from old into new dinars will take place on the 
date when the new dinar is put into circulation), and they will 
be used to indicate all prices of products and services. 
Finally, both the new and the old dinars will be used in trade 
payments in the FRY, but in separate accounts with the Trade 
Payments Service (with the noted obligation to keep business 
records in new dinars), while all monetary amounts will be in 
new dinars, except for those instruments of trade payments that 
are earmarked for old dinars (e.g., checks issued to citizens). 
<H5>  Beneficiaries of the Budget </H5>
  The federal government has decided that the average exchange 
rate of the new dinar will be equal to the value of one German 
mark and that it will be uniform, except for clearinghouse 
payments, where it will be 30 percent lower than the exchange 
rate of the new dinar to the U.S. dollar. 
  Businessmen, at least those consulted by VREME, are confused 
and worried, precisely because they expect the economic and 
state authorities to halt the hyperinflation and protect the 
stability of the domestic currency. The confusion comes 
primarily from doing business with two dinars--while the worry 
comes from the inability to perceive the authorities' ultimate 
intentions. 
  The introduction of yet another dinar to the trade payments 
system brings with it the practical need to open up a completely 
new line of account settling--from companies, through commercial 
banks, to the trade payments service and the central bank. It is 
inherent to the way that they operate that commercial banks will 
be the most overburdened, precisely because they are forced to 
develop new banks within themselves for all ordinary bank 
transactions, but with the new dinars. While some are utterly 
desperate because of the congestion that is already present only 
in the sector of private checking accounts, others are hoping 
that the onslaught will not come all at once, since the new 
dinars will not come flooding in either. The fact that the state 
has allocated around $4 million to back the complete issue of 
new dinars clearly does not mean that the entire new money 
supply will be put into circulation immediately. In fact, 
businessmen do not know how many new dinars will be in 
circulation next week, nor who will have them, but it can be 
assumed, judging from statements--albeit imprecise and 
inadequate ones--made by officials that beneficiaries of the 
budget will be the first to get new dinars. Thus, all the 
hirelings of the state apparatus, from the military and police 
to health care, education, and the other budget beneficiaries. 
Pensioners will be included with them, but it is unclear what 
will happen with the mass of nearly two million people who are 
genuinely unemployed. It is certain that this figure will be 
reduced, but it is still unknown by how much and at what pace. 
Naturally, one particular unknown is how much wages will be and 
how much the subsidies to uncontroversial budget beneficiaries 
will be. 
<H5>  From the Baker On </H5>
  This much appears indisputable: Everyone who does not get 
the 
new dinars, individuals or enterprises, but who needs them, has 
only one legal way to get them. That is by selling convertible 
currency to the bank. That is the only way to open an account in 
the new dinars. Anyone who goes to a commercial bank with 
foreign exchange, to buy dinars or for some other payment, will 
wait for his bank to do the same thing with the SDK [Public 
Auditing Service] or the central bank. 
  People and enterprises will be forced to sell off foreign 
exchange by the fact that old dinars will progressively drop in 
real value (if the authorities keep their promise that the issue 
of those dinars has been definitively halted). The amount of 
dollars and German marks in the reserves of business and the 
population remains unknown, even as a rough estimate. If it is 
true that the new dinars will go only to budget beneficiaries, 
then it will quickly become apparent which companies have 
foreign exchange reserves at their disposal: After all, in order 
to pay their employees, they will have to sell the corresponding 
sum of foreign exchange to their commercial bank, and based on 
that foreign exchange it will get the equivalent value of new 
dinars from the central bank. Foreign exchange or gold remains 
in the state reserves, and there are no more prime-issue loans, 
as long as feeding the budget with the bought-up foreign 
exchange reserves of citizens and business is not understood as 
a continuation of the credit arrangement. The commercial banks 
will be able to supply credits to their representatives only 
once both parties fill their accounts with new dinars. For 
example, bakers will first get new dinars from pensioners and 
state employees, but anyone who knows anything about the scale 
of the national economy knows that this and similar flywheels 
are too small and slow for the functioning of the overall 
economy. All that remains is the aforementioned way of speeding 
things up: the sale of foreign exchange reserves, in effect, to 
the state. 
<H5>  Straw Mattresses and Holes </H5>
  One special, and especially big subject is the fate of those 
who in fact have no foreign exchange reserves. Another question 
is this: What the state will do with those firms that offer 
foreign exchange for sale, but are not registered for foreign 
trading, i.e., had no legal right to foreign exchange accounts? 
Who acquired dollars legally under sanction conditions? 
Naturally, this is only a scarcely likely turn of events if the 
main goal of the authorities is to extract as much foreign 
exchange as possible from citizens and business. But this is in 
fact the catch: If the straw mattresses and secret accounts are 
opened up, the collectors of the foreign exchange will have no 
reason to inquire into the money's origin; if, despite draconic 
penalties, business continues to be done primarily in German 
marks instead of in superdinars, the authorities, such as they 
are, will have to turn to a less subtle way of collecting 
foreign exchange reserves. And although their size is unknown, 
those reserves are running low. On Wednesday the federal 
government allocated another $300 million: The central bank is 
authorized to go that far into debt, at the state's expense, 
with enterprises and individuals, for no longer than one year. 
  Is it only malicious people who will say that this is a new 
link in the well-known chain of old and semi-old Dafina-type 
foreign exchange savings? At the same time, the old foreign 
exchange savings are becoming the state's public debt; there is 
a semblance of honesty: The state accepts the obligation to pay 
out every cent, although depositors' claims are frozen for 
several years, and to then begin payments in the established 
monthly and annual portions. In the meantime, this debt, through 
tiny monthly payments, is reduced to a little more than $3 
billion. In banking circles, the theory is circulating that 
approximately 90 percent of all depositors possess only 10 
percent of that total, and these are generally old people, in 
view of when most of these savings came into being. Paying them 
off quickly and completely appears painless, and this would 
provide a large number of people with basic living expenses for 
several years: on the one hand only 10 percent of the total old 
foreign exchange deposits, while on the other hand a huge number 
of pensioners who are currently receiving "stamps" or some 
coupon for financing the pension fund over several decades. But 
this "little sum" is equivalent to what the federal government 
is promising to return if the central bank buys up that much 
foreign exchange, in other words, what it is able to offer, even 
if it is as a mere promise. 
<H5>  Trust in Promises </H5>
  Anyone who does not want a thorn in his healthy foot will 
reason something like this: It is perfectly all right that no 
one will be able to convert the old dinar into the new, i.e., 
into foreign exchange. However, the schoolgirl's happiness is 
spoiled by the fact that on Wednesday evening before the cameras 
of "Studio B" the head of the government's project, Dragoslav 
Avramovic, had no response to the direct question-conclusion by 
Dr. Tomislav Popovic, the director of the Institute of Economic 
Sciences, that hyperinflation began in the FRY in the summer of 
1992--to be more precise, with the adoption of the stabilization 
program of the Radoman Bozovic government, with this same 
Avramovic as the author of the program. This same schoolgirl's 
happiness is also spoiled by Serbian state television's failed 
efforts to hide the fact that the entire expert team (two 
institutes and the School of Economics) renounced authorship of 
the document signed by three governments and Mr. Avramovic: The 
director of the Economic Institute did not comply with state 
television's wish that he deny the conflict between experts and 
the authorities pushing "certain lists," because he only said 
that the experts have not given up on what they proposed to the 
governments, upon which he was cut off in mid-sentence. 
  Will the new dinar too settle in like the Serbian foreign 
exchange loan at the pinnacle of Milosevic's power four years 
ago, or will this type of power prove to be a financial ruin in 
the coming weeks and months? It is not right to the reader to 
end an article with a dilemma, neither under normal conditions 
nor under our conditions, but all hope must nevertheless be 
ceded to those who believe that man can change, only if he 
decides to do so, beginning tomorrow, or beginning Monday, or 
perhaps beginning at the first of the month....

<F P=106> [Article by D. Nedeljkovic: "Appeals"] </F>
  [Text] The management of the Serbian Electric Power 
Industry has found itself in a no-win situation. By appealing to 
consumers to conserve and rationally consume electricity, it has 
to destroy an age-old myth of Serbian might. In the former 
Yugoslavia, and especially during its disintegration, residents 
of Serbia were made to believe that the Serbian power industry 
is strong, that it can satisfy domestic needs and the needs of 
other consumers, and even export a surplus to European 
countries. Only France was held up as an example of a country in 
a better position and able to export more power than Serbia. 
Since the media, together with the highest political and state 
representatives, participated in the creation of this myth, it 
is not surprising that it became rooted in the people's 
consciousness. 
  Everybody thought that without Serbian energy, Slovenes, 
Croats, and Macedonians would be left in darkness, that their 
countries will not be able to survive. Nowadays, however, as 
soon as the weather turns colder, the Electric Power Industry 
appeals to consumers to conserve energy and then institutes 
cut-offs. Most people suspect the utility companies of some sort 
of a plot to cover up their exporting electricity and leaving 
consumers without power or simply a plot by enemies or 
saboteurs. All explanations by the experts, data, and appeals 
are at no avail -- people obstinately believe that there is 
plenty of electricity, even a surplus. 
  Facing the truth is painful. It obviously takes time to 
destroy a myth. However, the truth is that the Electric Power 
Industry of Serbia is incapable of meeting consumers' needs the 
moment there is a failure in the power system or a substantial 
increase in demand, which happens regularly when it gets colder. 
The experts say that the system can deliver 110 million kWh per 
day maximum. But consumption reached record levels last 
November, December, and January. A few days ago, consumption 
climbed to 114 million kWh and it will probably continue to 
increase. It is also true that we import power, be it from our 
neighbors or from former republics, whenever there is an upsurge 
in demand. It is also an unpleasant truth that power cannot 
reach consumers because the distribution system lacks the needed 
capacity. Around New Year's Day, 35 transformer stations and 10 
kilometers of long-distance power lines burned out, causing 3 
million German marks' worth of damage. Additional problems are 
caused by the lack of equipment and spare parts as well as the 
lack of funds. 
  Why the electric power industry became impoverished and why 
electricity consumption increased 60-70 percent is another 
question. Without speculating, it is worthwhile mentioning that 
in the opinion of experts the government deliberately "preserved 
social peace with low electricity rates." If this thesis is 
correct, the bill for such a policy will be too high. It must be 
remembered that although industry is virtually at a standstill 
-- hence not consuming much power -- this free-fall of 
industrial production will have to bottom out some day, since 
the crisis cannot last forever. But how to spur the economy if 
there is no power? 
  The electricity rates are probably the main culprit for the 
present situation, although prices are not the sole cause. Due 
to the low rates, the electric power industry cannot even use 
barter to pay its bills; a sawmill can pay its monthly bill with 
a board four meters long and a cement factory with a few sacks 
of cement. It does not pay for a utility company to read a meter 
and send a bill since the paper costs more than the amount due. 
This is absurd. Hope lies in the stabilization program. This 
year, the electric power industry expects an average price of 
four cents [as published], not realizing that nobody will be 
able to pay it.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Gulan: "Sell Your Land To Pay the Taxes"] </F>
  [Excerpts] By the Serbian Government's Decree on Taxation 
of Property, Agriculture, Forestry, and Independent Businesses, 
the farmers across the entire country, and there are more than 2 
million of them, who are the only ones to produce anything in 
these times, have again been brought to a hopeless situation. 
Taxes have been levied on them that they cannot pay. Not to 
mention how they are going to carry out the spring sowing of 
about 2.5 million hectares when the state has not ensured a 
single liter of oil. At these times, the most difficult 
situation is with households consisting of old people who 
possess land, but earn no income from it. 
  The following example shows best what troubles farmers are 
experiencing when, instead on investing money into sowing and 
new production, they have to fill the state coffers. Last year, 
a farmer with about eight acres (five hectares) of land got 
three tons of wheat or two tons of sunflower seed per acre, 
which is considered to be good for a dry year. Income from four 
acres of wheat, when one deducts the costs of seed and 
harvesting, totalled 500 German marks [DM]. The income earned 
from sunflowers, when the costs of seed and harvesting are 
deducted, was charged in kind, more than 600 liters of edible 
oil. Some of that edible oil was immediately exchanged for oil, 
and DM200 were immediately given for wheat seed. Added to this 
are the cost of wheat harvest (DM80 to DM100 per acre), plowing 
DM100, cultivation DM10 to DM15 per acre.... Along with all 
this, the household must pay the utilities charges, not to speak 
of what happens if a machine breaks down, or a pig-pen needs 
repair, Dragisa Maric, a farmer from Kac told BORBA. [passage 
omitted] 
  About 2 billion new dinars are needed for spring sowing this 
year. For the first time in half a century, primary issue 
cannot be used, and banks say that they have no money for loans. 
Moreover, the state, which is asking farmers to give money, has 
not made it possible for them to buy diesel fuel (not a single 
liter has been allocated for agriculture for several months), 
and the question is whether artificial fertilizers are going to 
be ensured and how is it going to be done (750,000 tons are 
needed by the middle of the year). Therefore, the state is 
addressing farmers again and asking for money from them.

<F P=106> [Article by Bozo Masanovic: "Succession Talks Must Continue"] </F>
  [Text] (From our correspondent) Geneva, 9 February -- 
Slovenia wants to resume the negotiations on the division of the 
assets of the former Yugoslavia. In a special memorandum 
addressed to Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, 
copresidents of the peace conference, it states that the FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] must be prevented from 
employing obstructionist tactics at the next session of the 
working group on succession. By rehashing the debate on the 
definition of the property of the former federation, the FRY 
delegation seeks to delay the division of assets among six 
successor states. Slovenia is proposing a four-point agenda. 
  At the meeting with Owen and Stoltenberg, Dr. Bebler 
[Slovene 
ambassador to Switzerland] explained how Slovenia proposes to 
get the succession talks out of deadlock. At the same time he 
expressed the opinion that to renew this process it is necessary 
to secure the support of the copresidents and the United Nations 
Security Council, which could, by adopting a resolution, 
threaten the FRY with extension of the present economic 
sanctions to include the property of the former federation in 
foreign countries if the FRY delegation continues its delaying 
tactics. These assets abroad could be frozen or put under the 
control of the United Nations or the countries on whose 
territory the property of the former Yugoslavia is located until 
the succession issue is resolved. Bebler said that without a 
clear threat we cannot expect progress at the negotiations, 
which are becoming futile. 
  Thorvald Stoltenberg, who listened carefully to the Slovene 
ambassador, promised to review the Ljubljana proposals. He and 
Lord Owen will study the recommendation to call up the next 
round of negotiations on the division of the "inheritance" of 
the former federation and proposed their ideas for unblocking 
the process. The working group on succession of the former 
Yugoslavia, headed by Danish Ambassador Alf Joensson, was 
supposed to meet in Geneva in the middle of February, but this 
deadline is probably unrealistic.

<F P=106> [Article by Kresimir Meler: "Intelligence Offices Are </F>
Merging"] 
  [Text] A secret agreement was signed at Plitvice on 
joint work by the intelligence and counterintelligence services 
of all three Serbian states; the normalization between Croatia 
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] is obviously only 
an illusion for the naive. 
  From our associate. 
  Whenever you think that it will be easy for you to do 
something, it usually turns out to be an unsolvable problem, 
says one of Murphy's Laws, which, whether the Croats like it or 
not, could have been invented precisely for the "presidium of 
Catholicism," as President Tudjman likes so much to call 
Croatia. Why? 
  Just a few days after the signing of the famous declaration 
on the normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations and on the 
day that Milan Martic was proclaimed president of the Krajina, 
something else extremely important happened. Specifically, as we 
have learned from reliable sources, an agreement was concluded 
at Plitvice on joint action by the intelligence and 
counterintelligence services of the republic of Serbian Krajina 
[RSK], the republic of Srpska [RS], and the FRY. At the same 
time, it is also the first step toward the official merger of 
the "Serbian republics" and the FRY into one state. After this 
step, the establishment of a joint command for the armed forces 
is planned; at first, it will only involve coordinating their 
work. Then, by March 1995 at the latest, the three current 
armies (the Yugoslav Army, the RS army, and the Serbian army of 
the Krajina) will also officially become one army. 
  How important the agreement to merge the intelligence 
services is to the FRY is also demonstrated by the fact that the 
chief of the FRY's military intelligence service, General 
Aleksandar Dimitrijevic, and his assistant for the 
counterintelligence service, Radenko Radinovic, were in Korenica 
personally, and General Bosko Kelecevic, Milan Gvero, and 
Milisav Gagovic also attended the meeting on behalf of the 
"Serbian armies." 
  Just a few days before, representatives of the newly 
established Russian intelligence service, the SVR, visited Knin. 
According to the protocol on joint action by the intelligence 
services, they decided on this step for the sake of "effective 
fulfillment of short-term and long-term strategic and security 
interests, and more effective guarantees of internal and 
external security." The joint intelligence service will have 
four administrations: an administration for external relations, 
an administration for analyses and investigations, an 
operational administration, and an external security service. 
The counterintelligence service will also operate as part of the 
operational administration. The center of the administration 
will be in Pancevo, and there will be "branches" in Banja Luka, 
Pale, Knin, and Petrinja. 
  The "branches" will consist of groups that will each have 12 
operatives/commanders, operatives who will take care of 
coordination, and advisers on artillery, engineering, the air 
force, and the infantry. A branch will be headed by a 
coordinator whose task will be cooperation with "headquarters." 
The "branches," in addition to their own coordinators, will also 
have a joint coordinator, who will officially head the 
intelligence services of the RS and RSK. General Bosko Kelecevic 
will be appointed to that position, and his deputy will be 
Smiljan Geric, who recently came from Belgrade. Both of them are 
adherents of Ratko Mladic, and are considered the most competent 
and most intelligent soldiers of the RS. In Knin, the 
(counter)intelligence service will reportedly be completely 
reorganized. That task has been entrusted to Generals Nedeljko 
Boskovic and Vuk Obradovic, who sharply attacked the Knin 
military leadership in their first reports. 
  In the future the Knin intelligence officers will not be 
able 
to act independently. At best, they will receive assignments 
from Boskovic or Kelecevic. The coordinator (Kelecevic) will 
decide on wiretaps and investigations, while the important fact 
is, above all, that intelligence officers from Knin will not be 
informed about certain actions (read: most actions)--even if 
Martic or General Novakovic, commander of the RSK army, were to 
be wiretapped or investigated.

<F P=106> [Statement signed by Christos Failadis, press counselor of </F>
the Greek Embassy in Tirana: "The Fourth Session of the Joint 
Greek-Albanian Interministerial Commission Has Concluded"] 
  [Text] The proceedings of the Fourth Session of the Joint 
Greek-Albanian Interministerial Commission concluded in Tirana 
with the signing of the appropriate protocol. The discussions 
between the Greek delegation, headed by Alternate Minister of 
the National Economy Ioannis Papandoniou, and the Albanian 
delegation, headed by Minister of Trade and Industry Selim 
Belortaja, took place in an especially warm atmosphere and were 
evaluated by the two sides as conclusive benchmarks for the 
advancement of bilateral economic development. 
  Mr. Papandoniou also met with Albanian Prime Minister A. 
Meksi, Deputy Prime Minister B. Kopliku, Minister of Foreign 
Affairs A. Serreqi, Minister of Energy A. Xhaja, Minister of 
Finance P. Dishnica, Minister of Agriculture H. Halili, and 
Minister of Transport F. Bitincka. He also met with the governor 
of the Bank of Albania, D. Vrioni. 
  These were some of the issues discussed: 
  Investments: There was a discussion of problems related to 
Greek investments in Albania and it was emphasized that it was 
necessary to conclude the essential procedures for protecting 
investments, by initialing, as soon as possible, the agreement 
on exemption from double taxation. It was stated that more than 
50 Greek enterprises have been established in Albania and that 
concrete interest has been demonstrated in setting up many more 
in various sectors, mainly as joint enterprises with Albanian 
companies. 
  The Banking Sector: The Albanian side said that it considers 
the willingness of the Greek banks to be a dynamic presence in 
Albania to be a positive element and it promised that it would 
reduce to 90 days the deadline for examining the applications 
presented to it. At this time, it was mentioned that the 
National Bank of Greece has shown interest in this matter. 
  Projects in the Infrastructure: The two sides agreed to 
cooperate on pinpointing projects in the infrastructure, 
especially in the transportation sector, with the aim of 
securing financing from Community sources and, concretely, by a 
PHARE [Reconstruction Aid to Poland and Hungary]/INTERREG 
[transnational cooperation program] coordinated initiative. 
Importance was given to the Ioannina-Kakaviie-Vlore-Durres 
highway and the railroad systems of the two countries. 
  The Agricultural Sector: It was agreed that there should be 
an evaluation of possibilities for cooperation in the 
agricultural sector by means of technical assistance by both 
sides in the training and specialization of cadres and technical 
assistance by the Greeks in the production of products of animal 
and plant origin, assistance in agricultural projects, in 
irrigation, in the mechanization of agriculture, and in research 
and applications in agriculture. 
  The Energy Sector: Cooperation should be expanded in this 
sector, on the one hand, with the construction of a 
hydroelectric power plant on the Vjose River on Albanian 
territory on the border between the two countries (the Greek 
Public Electricity Enterprise is collaborating with the Albanian 
Electricity Corporation on this project), and, on the other 
hand, with general cooperation of these two organizations in the 
electric power sector. 
  Technical Assistance: The Greek side stated that, in the 
framework of the bilateral technical assistance program, the 
implementation of the following projects in Greece or in Albania 
might be studied during 1994: technical assistance programs in 
the form of seminars and laboratories, the placement of Albanian 
experts in such sectors as public administration, the management 
of public service enterprises, management in enterprises, in 
tourism, in the banking sector, in the health field, in 
agriculture, in public works, in transportation, and in 
environmental protection, as well as cooperation between the 
institutions of higher education of the two countries. 
  The two parties found that there were extensive 
possibilities 
for the further development of cooperation in various sectors 
such as fishing, light industry, wood processing, mining, 
metallurgy, transportation, shipbuilding and repair, 
telecommunications, tourism, the production of construction 
materials, science, technology, and so forth.

  He entered the political life of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna as a representative of the Croatian Defense Council 
of Usora. Before the war he carried out duties in judicial 
bodies. Immediately before the outbreak of the war he was 
president of the Supreme Court in Doboj. He has served as vice 
president of the Croatian Community of Herceg-Bosna -- as it was 
called at that time -- and was later elected minister of justice 
and administration of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.

<F P=106> [Address by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to first </F>
session of the main committee of the Croatian Democratic 
Community (HDZ) in Zagreb on 24 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] We could speak about the fourth anniversary of the 
first HDZ convention for hours. However, that is not my 
intention. I would just like to ask you to recall, together 
with the Croatian public, what the situation was like four years 
ago, at the first convention. In those days, we could still 
expect to be imprisoned if we sang Lijepa Nasa 
[Croatian anthem]. Taking into account everything we have 
experienced over the past four decades and everything that the 
HDZ has achieved, everything that the Croatian people have 
accomplished in their centuries-long efforts to establish a 
sovereign and independent Croatian state, we should occasionally 
think about this seriously to be aware of some moments in 
history and our responsibility -- the responsibility of the 
entire nation -- and the situation in which we live. 
  I said we would not speak about this, but I want to briefly 
remind you of the most current issues facing us and facing 
Croatia, which also preoccupy the international public in Europe 
and the world. Above all, we are interested in solving the 
issue of Croatian areas under UN protection, but in reality 
still under Serb occupation. However, this issue is linked to 
the overall problem of the breakup of Yugoslavia, that is, above 
all to the solution of the military-political crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. I recently spoke in detail about these 
issues to the HDZ club of deputies. I believe that you have 
read about this, and therefore, I will not repeat myself. I 
will inform you about our current position. 
  All relevant international players -- from Europe to the 
United States -- have today for the first time reached a 
conclusion that the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina as it is, is 
impossible and recommended to us and, in their own way, they 
consider it necessary -- both because of us and because of the 
world -- for us to accept a solution according to which the 
Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina stays in a union with the 
Muslims. Even when I spoke on that occasion, I presented the 
reasons for that. You have probably read about it. At the 
time, they still had not spoken in such concrete terms and as 
publicly as they have in the period since I gave the speech. 
They are of the opinion that it is important, as U.S. Secretary 
of State Christopher said yesterday or the day before, that at 
least two nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Muslims and Croats -- 
establish cooperation and friendship. 
  Therefore, we are witnessing some kind of new geopolitical 
balance of powers, and as a result of this, a demarcation in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. The demarcation in this area has been 
going on since the breakup of the Roman Empire via Yalta to 
current efforts to solve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This 
is the first time that we witness main European states -- 
France, England, Germany -- reaching a consensus with the United 
States, which has again assumed the main role in resolving the 
crisis in Yugoslavia and Bosnia- Herzegovina. I say again 
because the United States already had that role in the 
beginning, only to let Europe and the United Nations handle this 
hot potato alternately. As this did not lead to a solution, the 
United States has now assumed the leading role and established a 
consensus. Of course, certain differences still exist, and 
Russia has made a separate appearance with tacit understanding. 
As I told you before, Russia remains a Eurasian power that will 
have a role to play, whatever happens. 
  Therefore, they have recommended to us, insisted and 
persisted, that we reach an agreement with the Muslims. They 
are demanding the same thing from the Muslims. The Muslim 
leaders, some of them, have accepted that suggestion coming from 
the United States and Europe and have spoken out in favor not 
only of the need for cooperation between the Croat and Muslim 
nations in Bosnia, but also in favor of the confederation 
between whatever will remain of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 
  Politically, an agreement in principle has been reached on 
this in separate talks. That was also discussed in the presence 
of those U.S., German, French, and English representatives whom 
I have mentioned. We also reached nominal agreement at the 
meeting in Frankfurt. I received the U.S. President's special 
envoy, I had phone conversations with the most responsible 
people, and currently, our foreign minister, deputy prime 
minister, and vice-chairman of the HDZ [Mate Granic] is not here 
because he is visiting major European cities to discuss that 
issue. 
  Roughly put, this would mean that some kind of federation 
between Croats and Muslims would be set up in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a confederation would be set up between 
that Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. In that respect, 
everything seems fine and acceptable for us. Acceptable for us 
inasmuch as that would be in the interest of the Croat people. 
  This would be done primarily to halt hostilities. An 
agreement was signed by General Roso, who is the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] commander in Herceg-Bosna, and Muslim 
General Delic along the same lines. The agreement is a big step 
forward toward ending the war. If the war continues, Croatia 
will find itself in a very unfavorable position. Therefore, we 
are interested in an end to the war. The war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would under such conditions [not further 
specified] be very unfavorable for Croatia. 
  We are also interested because a solution to the Bosnia- 
Herzegovina crisis is a precondition for resolving the issue of 
the UN protected areas in Croatia. We are interested because 
we, the Croatian nation as a whole, as well as Europe and the 
world, see this alliance with the Muslims, these mutual 
relations in Bosnia- Herzegovina and relations with Croatia as 
something that protects the interests of the Western world in 
relation to this new division, that is, this separation line 
between the major world powers. 
  And, we are interested because the Muslims, whom this 
friendship should steer toward the European, Western 
civilization, ought to develop so as to weed out those elements 
in Bosnia that wish to create a fundamentalist Islamic state. 
This is perhaps the most important reason for our acceptance, 
and this is the main reason why the major European states and 
the United States suggested we should accept such a solution. 
From that standpoint, this serves our interests, the interests 
of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the interests of 
the Croatian state in general. The problem now is to implement 
this idea in practice. 
  The signing of yesterday's cease-fire was an agreement in 
principle, and this was a giant step in the right direction. 
What lies ahead is an arduous task, negotiations, because the 
prevalent standpoint in the Muslim leadership is that the common 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Muslim and Croat Bosnia-Herzegovina 
should be organized as a single state with civil rights and not 
on a federal basis. and so forth. 
  We, Croats, have a long historical experience and, 
unfortunately, a bitter experience from associations: in the 
Hapsburg monarchy, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, where a 
personal [as heard] union became a factual union; then there are 
the experiences from the former Yugoslavia, especially from the 
socialist period, during which we had a constitutional and 
legal...[pauses] not only federal but also confederal elements 
of communal life for the peoples of former Yugoslavia, where 
Tito -- both as a Croat and a communist internationalist -- 
sincerely tried to resolve relations between peoples and 
nationalities, as they were called in former Yugoslavia, on a 
footing of absolute equality. In the last Constitution of 1974, 
he really provided the groundworks for full equality, not only 
proportionality but also parity in resolving... [pauses] for a 
consensus, to granting all rights to the minorities, the 
Albanians in Kosovo, the Hungarians, and so forth. Despite these 
constitutional and legal tendencies and in spite of the fact 
that the Communist Party and the then League of Communists stood 
behind such constitutional and legal solutions on the equality 
of nations, there was no equality. Not even Croatia could 
govern itself here in Zagreb, to say nothing of the Croats in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  Therefore, the Croats have enough experience not to accept 
such ideas suggested to us by unitarists, idealists, 
integralists, and communists, who said they would resolve the 
problem of democracy, socialist internationalism, and so on. 
The Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina cannot be happy with such an 
idea -- the idea to have this community of Muslims and Croats 
proclaim itself a democratic state, a centralized state 
guaranteeing civil and ethnic rights, and so on. So our task is 
to ensure the survival of the Croat nation on the basis of our 
overall experience, our historical experience, and on the basis 
of what happened during the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the 
disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina... [pauses] in a 
territorial sense... [pauses] because this is not only a matter 
of importance to the Croats there but also to the Croatian state 
and the strategic interests of the Croatian state. 
  When I hold talks and when I speak to my friends, I always 
say that if we do not secure our interests, we could lose Bosnia 
for the Croatian nation in a few decades, because the proportion 
of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina has fallen from 24 percent to 17 
percent or even less today. Therefore, we could lose Bosnia not 
only for Croatia, but also for the West in the sense in which 
they want Bosnia-Herzegovina to be saved from the division with 
the eastern world, from the need to ensure that extremist and 
fundamentalist elements do not prevail there. 
  We are ready to negotiate, we have presented our proposals 
which point out that, if the Serb part of Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
allowed to leave, this means that the rest of the world accepts 
the fact that Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot survive as a union of 
three republics. Then, naturally, if this is understood, the 
problem of division should be viewed in a different light, and 
not in the sense in which it is being done and has been defined 
so far in the framework of the Geneva negotiations. This is 
what things are about now. 
  This is yet another historic turning point in the life of 
the 
Croatian people and in the drawing of those everlasting lines, 
in the process of demarcation between different worlds and 
civilizations in this area. I can tell you that those who 
advocate such a solution -- the need for a federal, confederate 
[as heard] relationship between Croats and Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and a confederation between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia -- at the same time guarantee us 
that they will help us solve as soon as possible the problem of 
Croatia's areas under the protection of the peace forces, that 
they will give us everything they have offered us so far, while 
trying to move us in a direction other than that of our 
independent policy; therefore, that they will open up to Croatia 
all those international institutions, that they will grant us 
aid for the reconstruction of Croatia, that the problems of our 
membership in the Council of Europe and of partnership in NATO 
will be solved, and so on. 
  In a word, they not only consider Croatia an important 
factor 
for solving the crisis in this area, but they will also lend it 
full assistance in various forms to become one of the more 
prosperous countries attractive to others. Therefore, there are 
reasons, strategic reasons, for us, Europe, the United States, 
and the world to reach such a solution and, on our part, we will 
do everything to achieve this. 
  As I said, Granic is away. He had a meeting in Bonn with 
Klaus Kinkel, vice chancellor and foreign minister. In Rome he 
held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Andreatta, and he 
visited the Vatican. Today he is in Geneva, and then he will 
visit Paris and London, which does not mean that we (?only want) 
to inform others about our standpoints. We know that the United 
States has a crucial role. I again called the U.S. 
representative who will either come to Zagreb again soon, or the 
talks will continue in a different way. 
  We should be aware of the delicacy of the issue, of the 
solution that is being requested from us. It is delicate 
because we should override -- among the Muslim leaders, those 
who accept the initiative, who favor an alliance with Croatia -- 
the liberal-civic concept of state according to which 
territorially it is not necessary to make any divisions and it 
is not necessary to have any national attributes in the solving 
of the issue of Bosnia- Herzegovina borders. 
  Bearing in 
mind that it is being recommended both to us and to them that 
[word indistinct] I hope that we shall reach a favorable 
solution. 
  On the normalization of Serb-Croat relations: Apart from 
reaching a solution with the Muslims, of which I have spoken, it 
remains our objective to normalize Croat-Serb relations, in 
order to resolve the issue of the UN Protected Areas in the 
easiest possible way and include them into our constitutional 
system, and also because it is clear to everyone -- including 
foreign countries -- that without this normalization there are 
no chances for a new international order in this part of 
southeastern Europe and the Balkans. 
  As I have said, this remains our policy, but at the same 
time 
we are faced with the fact that the Serb side still has an 
insuffiently defined approach to this, that they have in recent 
days -- using the fact that all attention was focused on 
Sarajevo -- engaged in provocation, and, after a long time, have 
shelled the Maslenica bridge and taken the Gradiska bridge. Of 
course, these provocations were launched by those elements on 
the Serb side who do not want relations to be normalized, who 
want war at any cost. We must be consisitent, for our part, in 
the implementation of the peaceful solution policy. 
  In the last six months we have achieved almost amazing 
results in stabilizing the economy, in bringing inflation down. 
What our government has achieved, headed by [Prime Minister 
Nikica] Valentic and his first deputy Skegro, Bank Governor 
Jurkovic, and others too, but first of all these people who work 
day and night, in this respect amazes the world, and speaks 
again about the abilities of our people and about the fact that 
we had a program, which I announced as a program of economic 
renaissance, and people who knew how to implement it. The 
success in bringing down inflation, which we have been doing for 
six months now, should continue. We must continue running the 
state economy with seriousness. We must adopt a realistic state 
budget and stick to the budget that the government is to propose 
and the parliament to adopt -- with an extreme degree of 
responsibility on the part of each minister, each ministry, each 
body, each regional governor, each region, each municipality. 
  Clearly there are some concrete tasks here. Nikica Valentic 
and the others will speak about that later on, so I will not 
focus on that, but I am saying that, apart from resolving our 
foreign policy issues -- Croatia's position in the contemporary 
world -- economic development and stabilization are the main 
tasks on the home scene. 
  I wish to say something that I have been repeating since the 
first convention four years ago when I brought people from the 
Croatian diaspora to Zagreb and when I invited them to return to 
Croatia. I have been saying this at all meetings but there is 
still resistance to the integration of these people into 
Croatia's state and economic life. There is still a lack of 
understanding for this problem. These Croats who had gone 
abroad and earned larger or smaller amounts of money, some of 
whom made several hundred thousand marks or dollars -- not to 
say millions... [pauses] This, to us, is bigtime capital, and if 
these people wish to return with such sums, if they also wish to 
contribute their experiences and their knowledge and bring their 
children back to the motherland and join in the development of 
Croatia instead of staying abroad, then we should give them 
privileges in all areas, not obstacles. This is still going on 
--this is being done by the privatization fund, by some 
ministries, and by all lesser institutions. [applause] 
  If we are making special efforts to attract the richest 
Croat 
in the world, who is said to be among the hundred richest people 
in today's world -- a certain Mr. Luksic from Chile who is said 
to be in possession of $7 billion or $10 billion --- if we bring 
someone like that to Croatia and ask him to invest here and he 
agrees and even brings over his children who were born over 
there, what happens? The papers start writing that a Chilean 
is taking over Croatia's breweries or whatnot, instead of 
writing that the richest Croat, one of the richest people in the 
world, wishes to invest in Croatia. This is a form of 
resistance. Look, there are people whom I know -- I do not know 
if Marjan Petrovic or someone else, Rogic or someone is here -- 
who helped in the establishment of democracy, who helped us in 
the patriotic war, these people are facing such horrendous 
everyday difficulties here that they finally say Mr. President, 
if it were not for this Croatia, these obligations of ours, we 
would have left Croatia. 
  Gentlemen, please, I am calling on all of you to stop this 
because this is a way to prevent these people from returning and 
a way for this old managerial class from the communist regime to 
survive and stay in control of Croatia's economy. 
  As you know, I have never advocated, nor am I advocating 
now, that the people who managed companies and were leaders of 
Croatia should be removed at any cost, or even removed at all, 
provided they are able. On the contrary, we need their 
knowledge and experience. We must not act stupidly, and we have 
not done so, unlike some other former socialist countries. 
  But at the same time we must be consistent in the 
implementation of our HDZ program, the program of Croatia's 
economic renaissance, to create conditions for the return of our 
people, for the injection of capital and knowledge, and for a 
different kind of behavior from that which our people were used 
to during the 50 years of socialism. 
  Hardly a week goes by without my reacting to something, why 
something is not being done...[pauses] I have ordered in recent 
days that personnel changes be made in some bodies, in the fund, 
and in some other bodies [applause] where problems have been 
observed. 
  Gentlemen, as we are overcoming the crisis and resolving the 
problems I have mentioned -- Bosnia-Herzegovina, UN Protected 
Areas -- new, better conditions will be created for us. We must 
be ready for it, to remove in advance all obstacles to the 
inflow of fresh capital. We shall not sell Croatia, but we need 
the capital for our development. We must also make sure now 
that we do not squander the loans we shall get. We must ensure 
that production increases, that the employment level is 
increased in order to resolve vital questions of Croatian 
society, Croatian people, the Croatian state -- the return of 
refugees, the restoration of destroyed towns and villages -- all 
of this with clear ideas of the need for economic, cultural, and 
scientific progress in Croatia. 
  We necessarily had to neglect the fields of culture and 
science in the two war years. But we must be aware that in 
these very areas we must make a turn, even with the resources 
available to us now, and particularly later in new, more 
favorable conditions. 
  In this connection I would just briefly like to speak about 
what I told the HDZ club of deputies at the Croatian Assembly. 
We need better cooperation between the assembly and the 
government. I told the club of deputies that our government is 
an HDZ government. It has been implementing the HDZ program. 
Therefore, in this way we should approach its proposals and 
cooperate to improve the proposals, if necessary. Our party 
should not approach this government's proposals, particularly in 
extraordinary circumstances, by creating even bigger obstacles 
than is done by opposition parties. 
  One more thing: Ladies and gentlemen, our deputies have to 
be 
at their work place, in the assembly, they should not be absent 
when decisions are being made. [applause] Within the presidency 
we shall particularly tackle the new law and the problem of who 
should remain in the assembly and who should discharge other 
duties. But those who remain in the assembly must attend its 
sessions. 
  Furthermore, it is a practice in serious parliamentary 
democracies that all deputies do not deal with all problems. 
Deputies should decide to take up certain areas and become 
experts in their field, be it economy, health, or defense. 
Everyone keeps chattering about everything, no one about.... 
[applause; Tudjman pauses] and on foreign policy and so on. 
  Therefore, in this respect we should be responsible, because 
how things are going to be resolved depends on the quality of 
our work. We must not get involved in excessive politicizing, 
nor allow it. In this connection, please be informed, 
particularly the gentlemen from the assembly where some foreign, 
not only opposition figures, but also some foreign factors, who 
wanted to turn our policy into different directions...[sentence 
incomplete as heard]. Do not think that there will not be ideas 
in the future about returning to some old and new communities 
which would not be....[pauses] Therefore, all these digressions 
which have been called distractions and so on, all these stand 
in the way of the implementation of the HDZ policy and the 
implementation of state policy. 
  Therefore, I am asking you for full responsibility. We can 
have different views when it comes to the resolution of internal 
state problems, but there can be no different views on the 
implementation of the HDZ program, and the implementation of 
state policy. Even though we have so far tolerated such 
circumstances, we cannot forever allow obstacles to be made for 
us in this way. 
  I appeal to all of you present here to influence the public 
in that respect. People abroad are amazed [words indistinct]. 
We have spoken about this at the second (?HDZ) convention and at 
a presidency session. 
  Everything that has happened proves how correct our policy 
is 
but we must know that this also creates obstacles for us. We 
have to try to successfully resolve the problems we are facing. 
  I therefore ask the central committee, the (?legal) 
committee, and all individuals to be consistent in the 
implementation of the HDZ program. I appeal to every individual 
to show reponsibility. Let us recall that we did not have a 
united program at the first convention, four years ago -- that 
we did not have the majority in the parliament. Without the 
support of the majority of the people we would not have achieved 
everything we did achieve and we would not have got into the 
situation where Croatia and its leader are considered the key 
factors in the creation of the new international order in the 
area. 
  We can be proud of all this, but it all also places on us 
the 
burden of obligation to show great seriousness and 
responsibility. Thank you. [applause] [words indistinct]

<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F>
Serbian Krajina, by Luka Miceta; place and date not given: 
"Dzakula Is Not the Only One"] 
  [Text] "Personally, I have nothing against the fact 
that relations between the Republic of Croatia and Yugoslavia 
are being normalized. It is inevitable that more than three 
years of war be followed by a time of peace and that all 
conflicts be resolved by political means." 
  Until only several years ago, Milan Martic was the 
chief of a small police station in Knin. Now he is the president 
of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], the capital of which 
is Knin. People of ill-will say that there is no difference 
between his former and current functions. 
  Such are the times in which we live. Gloomy. 
  [Miceta] Based on the constellation of political forces (RSK 
president--RSK Assembly), it can be concluded that your position 
will unavoidably be marked by compromise. However, you were a 
policeman for a long time. Now you are the president of a state 
that is coming into being. To what extent will you be impeded in 
your current function by the habit and practice--acquired in the 
police--of subordination? It appears that you will have to be 
twice as tolerant, especially with regard to adopting a uniform 
position on the question of relations with Croatia, but also 
with Yugoslavia? 
  [Martic] In the last elections, the people in Krajina came 
out in favor of the political option--the unification of all 
Serb lands, that is incontrovertible. Accordingly, all those 
entrusted with a mandate must respect the will of the voters. As 
you yourself have noted, we have a situation in which on the one 
hand there is the president of the republic elected by the will 
of a large number of voters as the candidate of a citizens 
group, while on the other hand, in parliament, we have a 
coalition of the radicals and the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] 
of Krajina. This sort of balance of power should not and cannot 
be a handicap, assuming that all the elected representatives of 
the people are sincerely committed to the programs that they 
advocated in the election race. And it is only in this sense 
that compromises are possible. 
  Concerning the issue of relations between the republic of 
Serbian Krajina and Croatia or Yugoslavia, there can be no 
compromises that would be to the detriment of the will of the 
people of Krajina. Specifically, it is a known fact that the 
people in Krajina have held three referendums in which an 
unreserved commitment to living outside Croatia and to a unified 
state of all Serbs was expressed. Anyone who would be willing to 
compromise outside that framework in order to further their own 
political ambitions would be a traitor to the political option 
supported by the people of Krajina. 
  It is exclusively for that reason that I am insisting on the 
formation of an expert government, which at the same time should 
be an expression of national unity. I am certain that this 
stance will prevail in our parliament as well, because any 
insistence on partisan exclusiveness would land us in a blockade 
situation which would be very hard to surmount, given the 
current constitutional provisions. 
  [Miceta] What was the decisive consideration in your 
decision 
to run for the Krajina presidency? It was said in Belgrade, the 
story arrived from Krajina, that Mr. Milosevic persuaded you to 
run on several occasions? 
  [Martic] It is true that I was in a dilemma for a long time 
about whether to agree to run for president of the republic. The 
people who were most insistent about it were my fellow soldiers 
and people who share my political views. In that regard, I 
encountered support from a large number of politicians from 
Serbia, not only President Slobodan Milosevic. And there is 
nothing wrong with that. That was mostly support for the 
political option that I uphold. On the other hand, nearly all 
opposition leaders supported my opponent in the second round, 
Milan Babic. And that too is support for his political option. I 
see nothing wrong with that. Everyone supports the person who is 
closest to them politically. And that is the main reason that I 
agreed to run for president. Specifically, we have made too many 
sacrifices over the past three years of war to now turn Krajina 
over to the tender mercies of political intriguers, whose 
personal political affirmation is the top priority. We managed 
to make that clear to the people in the second round, and I 
think that that tipped the scales in the results of the voting. 
  [Miceta] Do you feel that the support that you received from 
Mr. Crncevic, Mr. Markovic, Mr. Kosutic, and Mr. Bingulac, who 
are not residents of Krajina, is natural? 
  [Martic] I have already emphasized that the basis of my 
political outlook is perseverance in the policy of unifying all 
Serb lands. I feel that I was supported in this by everyone who 
has the same outlook. You mentioned only some of the people who 
helped me in my election campaign. However, these people also 
included prominent politicians, businessmen, and cultural 
figures from Yugoslavia and the republic of Srpska who did not 
hide their support for my political option. And for their own 
option, of course. 
  [Miceta] Cooperation on a high political level has begun 
between the FRY and Croatia. The first meetings of teams of 
journalists from Belgrade with their colleagues from Zagreb, but 
also with Croatian political officials, are also taking place. 
To what extent can these and similar initiatives help you, and 
what is their influence, in your opinion, on the thaw in 
relations between Belgrade and Zagreb? 
  [Martic] Personally, I have nothing against the fact that 
relations between the Republic of Croatia and Yugoslavia are 
being normalized. It is inevitable that more than three years of 
war be followed by a time of peace and that all conflicts be 
resolved by political means. Likewise, I have nothing against a 
normalization of relations between the republic of Serbian 
Krajina and the Republic of Croatia in the foreseeable future. 
Naturally, several preconditions are necessary for that, most of 
all the establishment of a lasting peace. To achieve that, 
Croatia must stop its continuous attacks on the RSK, meaning 
that it must abandon its aim of overcoming its frustrations 
through force. Anyway, I am a pessimist with regard to the 
current political team in Croatia and its real intentions. 
  [Miceta] Veljko Knezevic has been appointed chief of the FRY 
office in Zagreb, a man who is believed to be a member of the 
SK-PJ [League of Communists-Party of Yugoslavia]. It is also 
known that you are at the very least a sympathizer of that 
party. Is it possible to say that for those reasons this is a 
good move by the Yugoslav diplomatic leadership, since 
ideologically close people work together better? 
  [Martic] That question is provocative. You are in fact 
bandying about certain rumors from the streets. Like if I were 
to say that it is known that NIN is an anti-Serb publication. As 
far as Veljko Knezevic and his political mission in Zagreb are 
concerned, he has only family ties with Krajina, i.e., he is 
from the Knin region by origin. But if that mission contributes 
to transforming military options into political ones, then we in 
Krajina will be the first to welcome him. 
  [Miceta] Naturally, it is inevitable to also ask to what 
extent this choice of "ours" will be received negatively both by 
the Croats and by the world, due to the animosity toward 
communism. 
  [Martic] As far as the Croats, or rather official Croatian 
policy, are concerned, I have already said that I do not believe 
that their intentions are serious. The question of the political 
option adhered to by Veljko Knezevic is not as important as the 
question of what the Croats actually intend to achieve through 
this move. I am profoundly convinced that their real goal comes 
down to creating the impression among Croatian public opinion 
that this means the return of Krajina of Croatia. On the other 
hand, toward international public opinion they are trying to 
create the impression that they are opposed to the military 
option and that they want to offer political cooperation to the 
Serbs. 
  [Miceta] In a recent interview, the former head of the 
civilian sector of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], Cedric 
Thornberry, offered a plan to solve the Croatian-Krajina 
problem. In short, it all comes down to a confederal or federal 
relationship between Croatia and Krajina. That corresponds to a 
significant degree to the views of certain relevant political 
circles in Belgrade, who feel that the problems in the territory 
of the former SFRY can be solved qualitatively within the 
framework of a union of independent states, where the RSK would 
have certain political but also territorial autonomy. What is 
your appraisal of this? 
  [Martic] I think that a resolution to the conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia, and thus a resolution to the Croatian-Krajina 
conflict as well, cannot be sought in some sort of political 
laboratory, contrary to the will of the people. We have had 
three referendums, three and a half years of war, and a large 
number of victims, burned-down villages, and refugees. We now 
have a state that is a reality. It is frivolous to seek any 
political solutions that disregard that reality. We are willing, 
if necessary, to hold yet another referendum under the utterly 
strict supervision of the international community, and to take 
it as the basis for seeking political solutions to the crisis in 
the former Yugoslavia. We have suggested to Mr. Thornberry and 
other world politicians and diplomats that they hold a 
referendum among the Croats concerning whether they want to live 
in the same state with Serbs. We are sure that the results of 
such a referendum would be negative. 
  [Miceta] The Serbian Assembly--at the prompting of the 
socialists, DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia] deputies, and 
Djindjic's democrats--postponed debate on the ultimatum to the 
Bosnian Serbs. The Krajina assembly concluded that an attack on 
Pale would be regarded as an attack on Knin. How do you 
interpret these two fundamentally different stances by two Serb 
assemblies? 
  [Martic] I feel that the Serbian Assembly postponed debate 
on 
this issue exclusively because it did not want to take any step 
that might hinder the position of the Serb nation as a whole. As 
far as the republic of Serbian Krajina is concerned, we are 
committed to mutual defense by the Prijedor Declaration. But I 
do not believe that there is a fundamental difference between 
Knin and Belgrade in their stance toward the NATO threats. 
<H5>  [Box, p 18] </H5>
<H5>  Milosevic Is Number One </H5>
  [Miceta] What is your opinion of the kidnapping of Mr. 
Veljko 
Dzakula? 
  [Martic] Why do you call it a kidnapping? 
  [Miceta] What would you call it? 
  [Martic] He was simply detained according to regulations. 
  [Miceta] Who detained him? 
  [Martic] The Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  [Miceta] Of Yugoslavia or of the republic of Srpska? 
  [Martic] Yugoslavia. There is an agreement, in case you did 
not know, on international cooperation among organs of internal 
affairs, to which Interpol is also party. This is inter-state 
cooperation. There was no kidnapping involved. Dzakula was 
simply detained because he did not have the right to leave his 
place of residence owing to the fact that criminal proceedings 
had been brought against him for serious criminal acts. 
  [Miceta] Why was the Serbian public not informed of this in 
a 
timely fashion? 
  [Martic] Why are you raising such a stink about Veljko 
Dzakula when there are thousands of cases like this, both here 
and around the world? I do not know where all this interest in 
Veljko Dzakula is coming from. 
  [Miceta] It is not Veljko Dzakula who is important, it is 
the 
way in which he was arrested! Because Veljko Dzakula could be 
any one of us! 
  [Martic] I do not know what the controversy is here. The 
person who did this identified himself and did this according to 
all regulations. This was not a kidnapping, but rather a normal 
action against a citizen of the RSK at the request of the 
judicial authorities and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the 
RSK. 
  [Miceta] Why did the local authorities not explain it? 
  [Martic] Go ask them. 
  [Miceta] You have said, to paraphrase, that once all Serb 
lands are united you will gladly hand power over to Mr. 
Milosevic! 
  [Martic] I have no ambition to be either ruler or prince. 
  [Miceta] But what if Milosevic does not want to be the 
president of all Serbs and of their borderlands? 
  [Martic] Given his merits and the fact that he has done 
everything for the Serb nation, he is the number one person for 
that. He is the best solution. That is my opinion. 
  [Miceta] If Mr. Milosevic does not accept it, do you see any 
other Serb politician who could hold that post? 
  [Martic] If he does not accept it, pan-Serb elections will 
be 
held, at least I hope so, and in that case everyone who feels 
that they can hold that post will have the opportunity to run 
and the people will decide who that will be. The people are the 
authoritative source for determining who their leader will be. 
  [Miceta] Will you run? 
  [Martic] No. I do not want to be a candidate. 
  [Miceta] I did not want to be malicious, but simply wanted 
to 
point out this contradiction when you said that you do not want 
to run. 
  [Martic] Well, I don't. I have already said that I was 
persuaded to run for RSK president. 
  [Miceta] What is the difference between Milan Babic and you, 
Milan Martic? It appears that Milan Babic wanted to be 
politically emancipated from Belgrade, but also to be 
economically linked to Serbia, to Yugoslavia. 
  [Martic] Please do not classify me as a puppet or regard me 
as a vassal, as some people wish to depict me. My political 
positions and political option have been accepted and respected 
by the ruling team in Serbia and Yugoslavia because they are 
identical in many regards. It is completely normal for the RSK 
leadership, the leadership of the republic of Srpska, the 
leadership of Serbia, and the leadership of Montenegro to be in 
close cooperation. That is the will of the people. 
  I have nothing to say about Milan Babic's personality. He 
had 
his option, I had mine, and the people decided. There were these 
two circles, everything took a rather long time, but the people 
appraised the situation and decided according to their will. 
  [Miceta] But you must admit that the elections were rather 
dramatic? 
  [Martic] Well, they were, and that is normal. Babic too had 
a 
chance to win, as did I. 
  [Miceta] Do you ever think that perhaps you were in a sense 
favored by the fact that you had the official political circles 
of the Republic of Serbia behind you, as well as their 
television? 
  [Martic] I have already answered that question. It is clear 
why someone supported someone and why a certain option was 
closer to them.

<F P=106> [Article by Kresimir Meler: "We Are Strong Enough"] </F>
  [Text] (From our correspondent) -- "Milosevic has betrayed 
us. What does the establishment of telephone connections between 
Belgrade and Zagreb really mean? It means that the republic of 
Serbian Krajina [RSK] will have to be connected with Zagreb. If 
that happens, then we will some day see Croatian police in the 
middle of Knin again. Then it will be too late." This was Rade 
Leskovac, president of Seselj's Radicals in Knin, commenting on 
the signing of the declaration on the normalization of relations 
between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. We 
talked to him at the Serbian Army Center in Knin, where he and 
his followers were assessing the "situation following the 
endorsement of the betrayal of the republic of Serbian Krajina." 
  [Meler] What did you decide at the meeting? 
  [Leskovac] Without doubt, it is almost obvious that 
Milosevic 
and Tudjman have done everything to stay in power, regardless of 
the circumstances. To put it more simply: Milosevic has sold out 
his people in Krajina to remove the sanctions against Serbia. As 
far as we know, within a month Krajina will receive practically 
no help. 
  [Meler] Are you sure that people in the RSK just want him as 
president? [sentence as published] 
  [Leskovac] Babic is the only one who insists that the RSK 
must be an independent and sovereign country, without having 
Belgrade, Zagreb, or Sarajevo as a patron. Babic is one of the 
few who are aware that this area must not become anybody's 
protectorate. I am convinced that Babic, as president, would not 
sign anything with the Croatians as long as Croatia does not 
recognize our country. 
  [Meler] Have you thought that he could change his position 
if 
Serbia threatened to discontinue aid? 
  [Leskovac] I am sure he would not. It is true that Serbia 
helps us, but we pay dearly for this help. Did you know that 
Serbia is taking bauxite from Obrovac along with some other ores 
for which it pays only one-fifth of the market price? You did 
not know that, did you? Our standard of living is higher than in 
Belgrade. True, we are without power occasionally, but this is 
certainly not the worst problem. 
  [Meler] Without aid you might experience certain 
difficulties...? 
  [Leskovac] What kind? If you have military aid in mind, I 
must tell you that we are strong enough. Over the last few days, 
the Vojvoda [Seselj] has sent us heavy weapons. We also expect 
300 Cossacks from Zhirinovskiy. These are people who have gained 
experience in various commando operations and are ready to 
liberate the occupied Serbian territories. All expenses are 
covered by our organizations in the United States, particularly 
Vojvoda Djujic's, which supports Babic and us. If necessary, he 
will even help us overthrow Milosevic. Milosevic has no right to 
be the president of Serbia anymore. He lost that right by 
signing the agreement which had sold out the Serbs in Krajina. 
His puppets Martic, Novakovic, and Bjegovic must also resign. If 
they do not leave voluntarily, they will be forced to. They have 
to go.

<F P=106> [Interview with Milorad Pupovac, president of the Serbian </F>
Democratic Forum, by Tihomir Dujmovic; place and date not given: 
"Do Not Mention the Badinter Commission"] 
  [Excerpts] Milorad Pupovac, a professor at the Faculty of 
Philosophy in Zagreb, politically prominent both during the 
former regime and after the democratic changes, has consistently 
supported a policy that classifies him among the Serbian 
hard-line intellectuals. He is president of the Serbian 
Democratic Forum [SDF]. 
  [Dujmovic] Whenever we asked ourselves how you envisioned 
the 
beginning of the normalization of the relations between the 
Croats and the Serbs, it always seemed to us that you envisioned 
it exactly as it is happening now. How right are we about that? 
  [Pupovac] The normalization started, in fact, much earlier. 
That means that efforts were made by both the Croatian and the 
Serbian sides to arrange the relations between the two states 
and the two peoples as soon as possible. We at the SDF, and I 
personally, believed profoundly that this was possible, and we 
have been doing everything during the last three years to 
achieve it. It sometimes seemed to us that we were very close, 
especially two years ago, and then things started going in the 
opposite direction. Not so much in Croatia but elsewhere, maybe 
more in Bosnia and in terms of world policy. 
  [Dujmovic] When we say that you imagined the beginning 
exactly like this, we are referring to the unresolved issue of 
the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] zones and the appointment of 
Veljko Knezevic as the head of the Serbian office in Zagreb. 
What do you think about this, is Knezevic coming to Zagreb as a 
winner or a loser? Is his appointment a provocation? 
  [Pupovac] This is the decision of the government of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], and one should not doubt 
its good will as long as there is no proof to the contrary. 
Veljko Knezevic is a citizen of the FRY, and it is probably best 
to put aside all the stories regarding this issue, including the 
stories linked to the name and work of Veljko Knezevic. If it is 
proven that his choice was not in accordance with the declared 
intentions, then, of course, there will be changes. But I hope 
that it will not be necessary to come to that. [passage omitted] 
  [Dujmovic] You have been in contact with Belgrade and Knin. 
Is it true that Knin is willing, under certain conditions, to 
accept the Croatian Government? 
  [Pupovac] Many have confirmed to me that a Croatian-Serbian 
agreement on the relations of Zagreb and Knin is possible. 
  [Dujmovic] Do you speak about individuals, "persons from the 
people," or statements of important politicians? 
  [Pupovac] No, I am not speaking about the people, because 
they are molded in accordance with the demands of the current 
political trends. I am speaking about those who know what is and 
what is not possible. Finally, I speak about those who know that 
compromise in Croatian-Serbian relations, and especially between 
Croats and Serbs in Croatia, is inevitable and necessary. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Dujmovic] What would be the compromise, what would both 
sides have to renounce in order to reach it? 
  [Pupovac] It is important to accept that mutual relations be 
resolved through an agreement, to find transitional solutions, a 
modus vivendi, which will be the basis for the final political 
agreement. This agreement must contain a mutual recognition of 
two peoples within one state, and, on the basis of this 
agreement which would precede the recognition, a political 
solution for life in common must be found. 
  [Dujmovic] When you say "mutual recognition of two people," 
does that mean that Croatia must recognize the so-called Krajina? 
  [Pupovac] I think that the fact must be recognized that the 
Serbian people have lived in Croatia throughout history and that 
they are a people with autonomous political will. Thus, what is 
at issue is an inalienable sovereign political will which simply 
cannot be annulled. This is why it is important that this fact 
be confirmed by the Croatian side, just as it is necessary for 
the Serbian side to realize that the fulfillment of its own 
right cannot be achieved by bringing into question the right of 
another people, but that a compromise has to be made. 
  [Dujmovic] Does the "political will of the Serbian people" 
also include the possibility of secession? 
  [Pupovac] The right to secession is a risky right, which, 
based on all that we know about international rights, cannot be 
achieved only on the basis of the desire of those who interpret 
this right as theirs. Namely, the rights of others should be 
taken into consideration, as well as the interests of the 
international community as a realistic framework for the 
fulfillment of this right. I expect, in this respect, that the 
Serbs will coordinate their national will for autonomy with the 
rights of the Croat majority people and that they will find a 
way of fulfilling, within this context, their right to 
self-determination within the republic. 
  [Dujmovic] Why, in speaking about the Serbs, do you use the 
expression "Serbian people in Croatia"? In doing this you 
violate the Badinter [EC Arbitration] Commission. Why do you 
qualify an entity consisting of somewhat more that 10 percent of 
the total population as a people? 
  [Pupovac] Do not mention the Badinter Commission, because it 
is one of the rather bad episodes in the disintegration of 
Yugoslavia. It is one of the episodes that undoubtedly can be 
linked to the escalation of the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia, not to mention that no one, absolutely no one, and 
especially not an ad hoc commission, can determine what this 
international right is. But, since we are speaking about this 
issue, one should say that what is at issue is a perception. 
What is involved is self-perception. You cannot tell the Serbs, 
who for the last 150 years have been perceiving themselves as a 
people with autonomous political will, that from now on they 
must not have that perception. It may be that such a 
self-perception is wrong, but it exists, and it is better to 
understand it that to go against it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by J. Dee Hill: "Czech Protectionism Grounds KLM </F>
Flights"] 
  [Text] The Czech government last month reneged on its 
air-transport agreement with the Dutch government and the 
Netherlands' national carrier, KLM, forcing the airline to cut 
back the number of flights it runs between Prague and Amsterdam. 
  KLM, which formerly ran twice-a-day, round-trip flights to 
Amsterdam, now has 10 instead of 14 weekly flights, with 
twice-daily service on alternate days. A KLM official said the 
airline was not allowed to choose which flights to cancel. 
  When asked why the Czechs took this unilateral step, Ivan 
Rada, head of civil air transport for the Czech Ministry of 
Transport, replied, "To protect CSA." 
  Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) is a financially struggling 
concern that lost about 1.2 billion Kc ($40 million U.S.) last 
year. Blaming foreign competition for its woes, the 
government-owned airline petitioned the Transportation Ministry 
to take action. The ministry then stopped KLM from offering any 
flights on days that CSA offers trans-Atlantic flights. 
  KLM protested that it had an agreement ratified by the Czech 
Parliament; air-transport agreements are negotiated between 
governments, not airlines. KLM made an attempt at conciliation, 
offering to limit the number of seats while keeping the same 
number of flights. KLM spokeswoman Marjorie Wenting said "it is 
a better product for our customers to have regular service." 
  Nevertheless, KLM's flights between Prague and Amsterdam 
were 
slashed, at an undisclosed financial loss to the Dutch company, 
beginning Jan. 1. An estimate using the 94-seat Fokker 100 plane 
with a round-trip, midweek fare of 6,990 Kc pegs the loss at 
about 2.6 million Kc ($90,628) per week. CSA's lowest fare for 
the same trip is 8,560 Kc. 
  "According to our opinion, the agreement between the two 
governments gives KLM rights," Wenting said. "It is a concern 
for us that this is possible in this country even though we had 
an official agreement." 
  Rada said the problem was that while the air-transport 
agreement was approved by Parliament, it was not approved in its 
final form by the Transportation Ministry. "Troubles appeared 
when Holland's KLM office started selling tickets for flights 
that weren't approved," he said. 
  Mike Higgins, director of British Airways for the Czech and 
Slovak republics, said that regardless of who is right in this 
instance, the government's protectionist stance toward CSA is 
bad for the industry as a whole. 
  "A profitable company is better for customers all-around 
because it can reinvest the money in providing better service," 
Higgins said. "In terms of competition, the whole idea of the 
European Economic Community is a free market and deregulation. I 
would certainly hope anyone who wants to become a part of that 
would adopt these [free-market] principles."

<F P=106> [Article by J. Dee Hill: "Oil Pipeline Shutdown Serves as a </F>
Warning"] 
  [Text] When the crude oil flowing through the pipeline from 
Russia to the Czech Republic was cut off for five days last 
month, it gave government and industrial users cause for alarm 
and served as a dire warning of what the future might hold for 
countries that rely on Russia for energy. 
  No oil flowed through the Druzba--or "Friendship"--pipeline 
from Jan. 17 to 22, after several major exporters of oil from 
Russia apparently failed to receive the proper licenses for 
export from the Russian government. 
  According to Jana Hejskova, a senior manager at Chemapol, 
which is the main Czech buyer and supplier of Russian crude, 
halts in the oil flow from Russia have become a common 
occurrence in the last two months. 
  "It's the red tape and the generally unpredictable situation 
[in Russia]," she said. "If you ask the Russian ministry [that 
manages oil exports], they will tell you that everything is 
working normally, so they won't do anything about it." 
  Chemapol buys about 500,000 tons of oil monthly--90 percent 
of the Druzba pipeline's supply to the Czech Republic. Hejskova 
said it took the company more than a week to return to normal 
after the shortage. 
  An official with Synthesia, a large Czech chemical concern, 
said that while its production had not fallen behind during the 
shortage, it is now trying to strike its own deal with Polish 
and Western European suppliers. 
  "We have no other supply," said spokesman Gregor Vavruska. 
  By the time the oil flow resumed, the Czech Republic's three 
refineries in Litvinov, Kralupy and Vltavou and Pardubice had 
exhausted the reserves of Chemapol oil and were forced to buy 
oil from the reserves of Transpetrol in Slovakia, whose supplies 
would have lasted only four days. 
  A crisis was in the making. Fortunately, however, the flow 
resumed and there were no reports of problems or panic at the 
refineries. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the 
situation could be repeated. 
  The threat of a crisis highlighted the Czech Republic's 
precarious position as a country with a single-source oil 
supply. Chemapol would like to reopen a pipeline leading from 
Rijeka in the former Yugoslavia up through Croatia, Hungary and 
Slovakia. That pipeline has been inoperative since September 
1991. The proposed Ingolstadt pipeline, leading from Bavaria to 
the Czech Republic, still faces many obstacles. 
  Dusan Strauch of the Czech Material Reserves office said the 
government is building more reserve capacity for crude oil, 
which currently only exists with the refineries themselves. 
  "I know very well the Western system, with 90-day reserves," 
Strauch said. "But when we were cooperating with the Soviet 
Union some years ago, they told our leaders that it was not 
necessary." 
  Strauch declined to say exactly how long Czech industry 
could 
function with a cut in the Druzba supply, but he did not contest 
the report by Czech newspapers that the country can function 
without the pipeline for 30 days. New reserve construction, he 
said, will take several years, and the first storage facility 
will hold 500,000 tons.

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Gomez: "A Crack Emerges in the Klaus </F>
Facade"] 
  [Text] A mild-mannered parliamentary deputy from northern 
Bohemia has cracked the monolithic image of the Czech Republic's 
most powerful political party. 
  In the aftermath of Josef Jezek's resignation Jan. 19 from 
the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) the governing coalition's 
dominant partner looks a bit less like a well-oiled machine 
walking lockstep behind its guiding leader, Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus. 
  ODS is so strongly against dissent that its 1992 political 
platform included a promise that no deputy would switch sides or 
leave the party. The ODS leadership has called on Jezek to 
resign his parliament seat, but it can't force him to leave. 
  The departure of Jezek, an owlish expert on the thorny issue 
of devolving power to local governments, has brought 
long-standing whispers of discontent within ODS to the surface. 
ODS favors maintaining a strong central government. 
  Amplifying the air of discord caused by Jezek's resignation, 
ODS parliamentary deputies have produced a study that points to 
tensions between the party leadership and its elected 
representatives. The issue of how to reform and structure local 
governments--which prompted Jezek's departure--helped introduce 
an unfamiliar level of disunity in the party. 
  Jezek takes a stronger view, saying that party consensus had 
been lost forever. 
  "The ODS is today a different party than the one that worked 
out its election platform in 1992," he said. "The differences in 
viewpoints of individual members is sometimes so broad that it 
seems a miracle that the party manages to stay together." 
  Until now, ODS has formed the bulwark of a stable 
government, 
while other parliamentary parties, especially those in 
opposition, went through membership upheavals and conflicts. 
  Now, ODS deputies talk openly of differences, something that 
was unheard of only a few months ago. 
  "It's no mystery that ideas in our [parliamentary] club on 
land administration are not completely unified," said ODS Deputy 
Frantisek Kozel. "The majority of the club understands [Jezek's 
resignation] as a gesture that underlines a certain 
dissatisfaction." 
  In contrast to this opinion, which has been carefully 
articulated by some ODS parliamentarians, Deputy Prime Minister 
Petr Cermak shrugged off Jezek's resignation as a personal 
decision that will have only a marginal effect on the party. 
  "I don't think his opinion echoes to any great extent the 
opinions of other deputies in the ODS club," Cermak said. 
  The deputy prime minister was also quick to dismiss any 
notion that deep divisions were developing in the ODS over the 
issue of local governance or the similarly controversial church- 
and Jewish-restitution debates. 
  "We're simply looking for a point of view," he said. "That 
doesn't mean we're dividing into factions according to who holds 
what opinion." 
  Yet the local government issue has steadily grown in 
importance as the fall local elections get closer and the 
perception grows that the government is dragging its feet on 
making a final decision. 
  Last July, Jezek was part of an ad-hoc commission that 
studied the issue and drew up some proposals. 
  Since then, the government has failed to come out with a 
single concrete point of view on the issue of land reform, 
enforcing the opinion that it is opposed to sharing power with 
localities. A very public debate has been waged over how many 
regional administrative districts there should be, what powers 
they should have and how many levels of government should exist 
under central rule from Prague. 
  In Jezek, some believe the party is losing a credible voice 
on these questions. 
  "Jezek was considered by people in the club as an expert who 
understood this area," said Kozel. 
  Jiri Honajzer, ODS parliamentary chairman, said he told 
Jezek 
that instead of resigning over the issue, he should have stayed 
on and tried to convince people of his ideas. 
  Instead, Honajzer said, Jezek was often away from 
parliamentary club meetings because he was off talking with 
local government experts and mayors. 
  "I think it's better to stay in the arena and convince 
people," Honajzer said. 
  He pointed out that the only action the party can take 
against a parliamentarian who votes against the majority on a 
major issue is to send a letter to the member's constituents 
alerting them to the fact. Honajzer said this measure has never 
been used. 
  Despite these assertions, the ODS leadership's reaction to 
Jezek's defection was to demand his resignation from parliament. 
The day of his resignation, Jezek was called into a meeting of 
the top parliamentary and Cabinet members. 
  After listening to his reasons for resigning, Klaus called 
on 
Jezek to resign his seat in parliament. This sparked a debate in 
which some of those present argued that Jezek was fully within 
his constitutional rights in resigning from the party and 
following his own conscience in parliament. 
  Nothing came of the discussion, though, because the ODS 
leadership lacks legal authority to force Jezek to resign his 
seat. 
  Among Chamber of Deputies members on both sides, the 
dominant 
reaction to Jezek's leaving ODS was complete surprise. 
  Those who called for Jezek's resignation from parliament 
cited what they said was the party's electoral platform in 1992, 
in which a promise was made to the electorate that no deputy 
elected under the ODS banner would switch sides or leave the 
party. 
  For his part, Jezek said, he doesn't remember ever having 
been informed of such a promise by the party. 
  "I didn't [make the loyalty vow] ever during the campaign," 
he said. "I don't have the least bad conscience that I've 
cheated the voters or anyone else."

<F P=106> [Article by Josef Stetka: "The Transformation of the Czech </F>
Republic Army"] 
  [Text] At his first meeting with rehabilitated soldiers, 
Defense Minister Baudys expressed his regret that the Army does 
not have enough money to retain the younger command personnel. I 
contradicted the minister and said that there is enough money, 
but that it is not being utilized purposefully. I was not alone 
in making this argument, so the minister was given a few 
specific examples, not only from the Defense Ministry, but also 
from the General Staff and the former Western Military Circuit 
[ZVO]. It is to his credit that he stopped squandering more pay 
on a gentleman (or rather, comrade) who was discharged from the 
Army despite stiff resistance from Mr. Pezl [former chief of the 
General Staff], resistance motivated by the fact that he was an 
"irreplaceable expert" (it could not be otherwise; after all, he 
was one of the main organizers of the Zasah and Vlna 
operations). Mr. Pezl expressed his opinion of this "expert" in 
an interview with editor Grunthalova in TELEGRAF. This comrade 
had duties pertaining to a senior officer, duties that in the 
Army correspond to the rank of captain, but he received the same 
pay as a deputy chief of the General Staff. It is not difficult 
to work out who was responsible for this. 
<H5>  A Mere 240 Million Korunas </H5>
  The minister's response to other disclosures, however, was 
not so unequivocal. The objection that new defense systems 
compatible with those of NATO are not being purchased for the 
Army, but personal Mercedes Benz cars are, was resolved by the 
cars being put in the garage for three months. However, they 
are now once more cruising along our highways. The minister 
also did not respond to the revelation that the former commander 
of Armaments and Technical Procurement should have been 
responsible for drawing on the authorized budgeted resources for 
the ZVO ("Our proposals were not taken into consideration in the 
1992 exercise year and, consequently, we consider an evaluation 
to be unnecessary bureaucracy"). The issue here involved a 
"mere" 240 million korunas and, so that the red tape did not 
grip too tight, all the documents were shredded before 9 
February 1993. This may be why this enemy of bureaucracy was 
appointed ZVO commander. 
<H5>  Distinguishable Oil? </H5>
  The retirement of various generals and administration 
commanders is another example of "purposefully" expended funds. 
I will cite one case for all of them. When General Barak 
retired, he kept for three whole months--when General Barta was 
already in office as his successor--his staff car and a 
secretary and used all the means of communication in the 
administration. That was mainly so he could increase his 
business activity and so that Tesla Pardubice would not cost him 
so much. You would think that someone would go back and review 
his business trips and find out who had authorized them? Why 
should we bother about such petty details since, after all, the 
Army does not care about them. 
  I would also like to mention that the retiring communist 
generals purchased from the defunct Warsaw Pact all the supplies 
of fuels, aircraft fuel, and lubricants stockpiled in our 
military stores--for peanuts. Did Czechoslovakia, as one of the 
members of this disintegrating organization, receive an 
appropriate amount for these bargain-basement fuels? However, 
since none of our government protagonists--including the prime 
minister--is familiar with dirty money, it is impossible to 
ascertain for what purpose these supplies were purchased. It is 
possible to ascertain, however, that they were sold not only to 
civilian enterprises, but also back to our Army. It should be 
easy to distinguish the 100,000 hectoliters of Warsaw Pact 
aircraft petroleum from the 100,000 hectoliters of CSFR Army 
aircraft fuel stored in the same tanks--or am I mistaken? 
<H5>  What Was Left by the Soviet Army </H5>
  It is unnecessary to say too much about the selling of 
military exercise areas [VVP] for ludicrous sums or even just 
for write-offs. However, at least something will act as an 
illustration: The deputy commander of the Military Housing 
Administration has carried out such economic regroupments that 
even U.S. managers may envy him. Did the commander of the 
administration or the chief of the General Staff know about 
this? Buildings vacated by the former Soviet Army in VVP 
Milovice were sold to Colonel Zbytek (by the way, he is the one 
who became famous at the United Agricultural Cooperative 
Congress in December 1989 for his demand to use force against 
those subverting socialism in the CSSR) for more than 140 
million korunas, although it says unequivocally in the 
agreements on the withdrawal of Soviet troops that all the real 
estate must be offered first to the Czechoslovak state. It is 
no longer necessary to mention his cooperation with former 
Defense Minister Vacek in the Ralsko Free Trade Zone. He was 
promoted to the rank of general for his "services" to the state 
and, when he retired, he was given a better appraisal by the 
supreme commander than any of those who fought in foreign armies 
in World War II. Or, the sale of the exercise ground in Karlovy 
Vary, where Colonel Salek--otherwise commander of the Regional 
Military Administration in Karlovy Vary--and his son 
distinguished themselves by managing to appreciate the value of 
one square meter by around 500 percent the next day. How much 
did they make, given that it was 100 hectares (of course, it was 
not to the Army's benefit)? Who gave them the go-ahead for 
this? The ministry's inspection team, led by Colonel Silhan, 
did not find anything suspicious about this deal. I do not know 
of any case that would have been submitted to the Prosecutor's 
Office for investigation--or, God forbid, for 
prosecution--during the time that this commander and Minister 
Dobrovsky were in office. Why be petty, the new budget will 
take care of it. 
<H5>  Incompatible Computers </H5>
  There are about 1,000 senior officers and civilian personnel 
in the General Staff, but there are also more than 1,000 
personal and other computers there that were purchased in an 
uncoordinated manner (let us exclude the intention) by various 
administrations, commanders, and so on. Of course, no one is 
capable of putting together a network from these 
computers--which, with a few exceptions, are incompatible--to 
handle not only command, but also communications logistics for 
the General Staff. Thus, the computers have been downgraded to 
luxury typewriters worth a cool 50,000 to 100,000 korunas each. 
I pointed this out to Mr. Pezl at the meeting with 
rehabilitated officers. But to no avail. In fact, the upshot 
is that last year--that is, 1993--incompatible computers were 
again purchased in an uncoordinated manner for millions of 
korunas. I will not publish the exact sum so that I am not 
suspected of revealing a military secret, if such economic 
management is a military secret. A novice economist may perhaps 
be able to work it out. 
  Apart from this computer shambles, there are X number of 
modems (the commander of the Communications Administration can 
supply the precise number) in the General Staff, which enable 
their addressees to have fax links from their workplaces in the 
General Staff to their apartments, businesses, and--of 
course--anywhere else. Why observe military secrecy when a 
classified or even a strictly classified document can be sent 
anywhere by modem, even to the KGB, for instance. However, I 
breathed a sigh of relief. I found out that the KGB has been 
abolished. 
<H5>  Illogical Logistics </H5>
  Support units were turned into "logistics" in the name of 
transformation, although no one there behaves logically. 
Instead of reducing the number of colonels and 
lieutenant-colonels and increasing that of the non-commissioned 
officer and warrant officer, they have begun to equip the 
offices with new furniture and carpets, including these 
computers. Illogically, not one new defense system has been 
purchased and technical equipment for the Military Police has 
been shelved so that it cannot point out this illogicality--or 
anything else. The gentlemen at the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff are acting like Marshall Russworth in the 
Emperor's Baker--they are buying trinkets and 
feathers for their overgrown administrations and departments. 
If they think this is the correct way to transform the Army, 
they are certainly quite mistaken. We can imagine how they 
contribute to the Army's credit in the eyes of the taxpayers. 
Probably they do not; otherwise they would not run things like 
this. 
<H5>  Impatient NATO </H5>
  I am aware of how NATO is burning with impatience to take us 
into its bosom. An Army that does not know that, if it retains 
an intolerable number of senior officers and does not transfer 
funds to the lower command levels, it cannot undergo any 
transformation, an Army without compatible defense systems, an 
Army that cannot stick to its annual budget and must survive to 
the detriment of the following year? An Army in which to this 
day there are more than 2,000 former political staff, more than 
half of whom work in the units and offices dealing with the 
training of young people? An Army in which a "university" 
education obtained at the Vokovice Sorbonne or at another 
Marxist-Leninist-type political college of a similar level is 
enough for the rank of colonel? An Army in which not one KGB 
agent has been uncovered and that applied to communist generals 
to draw up its transformation plan? This transformation plan is 
a mockery of a defense doctrine, including the one whose author 
is, allegedly, a former chief of the General Staff. An Army 
whose senior command is--according to a recent statement by the 
defense minister--made up of traitors, because anyone who after 
1968 agreed with the Soviet aggression is a traitor. Mr. 
Minister, these are not my words, they are your evaluation! You 
should draw conclusions from your own statements! 
<H5>  The West and Russia </H5>
  In 1938 we had one of the better equipped and trained armies 
in Europe, an army that could have been one of the decisive 
factors in the clash with the "brown plague." Despite this, our 
allies did not include us in the anti-Hitler coalition and 
peddled us in return for a dubious attempt at preserving the 
peace for their own countries. To think that we would be more 
attractive for them today is an unforgivable error. Everyone 
knows how the elections in Russia have turned out, and I do not 
just mean Zhirinovskiy. The "democrats" Yeltsin and Kozyrev 
speak just as unequivocally. If the West again needs to make a 
concession to preserve the peace for its countries, a new Yalta 
will be formulated and we will be surrendered to another 
plague--a red one. We recently learned that we should not 
submit our request for admission into NATO in Brussels, but in 
Moscow. Obviously, will be able to tell the next day whether 
Partnership for Peace prevents it. 
<H5>  The Tradition of the Minister's Advisers </H5>
  It has become one of the traditions of our "post-revolution" 
Army that a retiring senior Army functionary acts as an adviser 
to the new defense minister. Obviously, he is supposed to 
advise him in such a way that it can be passed on that it was 
not like this under us. Mr. Vacek was an adviser to Mr. 
Dobrovsky and, during this period, he got better at tennis and 
swimming and even managed to write his first socialist literary 
work--Why I Should Keep Silent. Why would he prefer not to keep 
silent? He could still be giving advice today. The minister's 
current adviser is Mr. Pezl. What is he advising him? How, at 
a time of dire peace, to acquire four general's stars in just 
under three years? On the basis of a query made in the Military 
Historical Institute, this is a completely unknown phenomenon in 
the history of the modern military. Perhaps it was necessary to 
increase the Army's prestige in the eyes of the civilian 
population. Or, how to maintain the highest possible number of 
protagonists of the former regime in senior posts, including 
those who took part in the Zasah and Vlna operations? I would 
add the Order of Victorious February to his last general's star 
for saving those who shared the same ideals as him. Mr. Pezl 
often blamed shortcomings on the communists' 40-year reign. Has 
he forgotten that he himself played no small role in this 
government--before 1968 and again after 1989? It is not, 
General Pezl, just the 40 years of communist government; you 
have to add to this the three years when you were chief of the 
General Staff. You did not resign from the party of the 
Bolsheviks, you had to be expelled from it; otherwise you would 
probably still be there today. Or, perhaps you are advising the 
minister how to discharge the senior officers faced with 
screenings and to give them 3,800 korunas per month until they 
reach retirement age--and then hire them again at the Defense 
Ministry or the General Staff and place them on the 11th pay 
scale as civilian employees, who are not subject to screening? 
<H5>  How To Make Money Privately on the Ministry's Budget </H5>
  In every normally managed entity, an order is placed with an 
enterprise that is able to do the requested work or to fill the 
order. The work is invoiced after it is completed or partly 
completed. Invoicing before completion is only done in 
exceptional cases, for example, in filling foreign orders and so 
on. Why are things different at the Defense Ministry and the 
General Staff? I can cite the specific example of how a former 
senior officer gets together with four other people, amasses 
100,000 korunas, and registers a shareholding company--the 
officer places an order with it for the Army worth 1 million 
korunas for delivery and assembly. The newly established 
shareholding company buys materials from this million korunas 
and invoices them with the work for the Army. A profit is 
guaranteed and is divided. How? In a legal procedure, the 
shareholding company would have to borrow money, for example, 
from a bank and pay the interest out of its profits. I do not 
believe that it would be too difficult to find out in how many 
cases business was conducted this way in the Army. 
<H5>  One Should Respond to the Criticism, Not to the Critic </H5>
  This does not make pleasant reading, and I will certainly be 
attacked for criticizing too harshly. Unfortunately, this is 
far from everything, it is merely the acclaimed tip of the 
iceberg. First of all, it should be ascertained whether it is 
really the truth, and only then should action be taken. I am 
not writing this to discredit the Army, but as proof of why I 
have no faith in how the Soviet-type army is being transformed 
into an army that could be admitted into NATO. 
  When Mr. Baudys came into the Army, he issued such 
statements 
that I came to believe in him. But when the year was over and 
reality did not match up to his statements, I began to have my 
doubts. I now know that I am unable to change or correct 
anything myself, but I cannot let it pass without comment. I 
have never been in favor of across-the-board solutions, but I am 
also not in favor of a thick line under the past. After all, 
there is a considerable difference between an employee in the 
political apparatus who distributed newspapers and the behavior 
of a hardened ideologue paid not for his military knowledge, but 
for his party work in the irreconcilable class struggle. I 
think, Mr. Minister, that you have squandered the opportunity to 
set down this difference in the recent assessments of the corps 
of commanders. Just as you squandered the approval of the law 
on the illegality of the communist regime. 
<H5>  And What Does the Parliament Have To Say? </H5>
  I would like to address my final appeal to another 
institution, which in fact is most responsible for the twists 
and turns of this whole transformation process, even though it 
does not want or know how to acknowledge this. I cannot 
understand, given the number of critical articles concerning the 
Army lobby, why our parliament's Defense and Security Committee 
has still not dealt with these issues. It is impossible to 
leave the Army--one of society's power-wielding elements--to 
self-control and self-regulation. Why in other armies do the 
inspector generals enjoy the support and even respect of 
parliament, the government, and the supreme commanders, while in 
our country--where the Army is tossed about by its ideological 
heritage and by corruption of unknown proportions--the attitude 
of a "dead beetle" is adopted? 
When I said in OBRANA LIDU in 1991 that the post of inspector 
general is essential for the Army, I was considered to be a 
simple idealist: Come on, man, the Army will be democratized, 
why the supervision? The facts show that this issue has been 
severely underestimated and if it is again left to the 
discretion of Army officials, in the next two or three years we 
will have to scrape together several more tens of billions of 
korunas to put right what we neglected now. With all due 
respect for the high IQ of the possible candidate from the 
Christian Democratic Party, Vaclav Benda, I think that the 
bargaining among the parties for a functionary for this post has 
to proceed from more than party criteria. 
<H5>  We Need an Army Inspector General </H5>
  I do not know if Mr. Tigrid's appointment as a minister was 
merely a campaign move by the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party or indeed a glimmer of better 
times, but I pray that he was not the exception that confirms 
the rule. He has assumed a great deal of responsibility, and I 
hope that he proves that we do not just have "personalities" in 
the political parties. 
  Esteemed deputies, I am turning to you, to the 
representatives of those who want to again believe that the army 
is protecting them and that their money will not be frittered 
away, but really used for what it was intended. Do you think 
that when you leave the Army to self-maintenance and 
self-regulation you are doing your voters a service? Certainly 
not. I am asking you to draft a law on an inspector general, 
without unnecessary procrastination. 
  We all know that now, after the offer of Partnership for 
Peace from the West, the Defense Ministry along with the Foreign 
Ministry has to submit to our future alliance partners our 
concept for this partnership. Do you think that generals reared 
by the Warsaw Pact's military doctrine have the best concept for 
this partnership? Minister Zieleniec gave the best answer to 
this question in Sunday's Arena program when he said that there 
has to be civilian supervision of the Army. Under the current 
legal arrangement, I cannot imagine anything other than 
parliamentary supervision.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonin Rasek: "The Czech Army Has Been in </F>
Existence for One Year"] 
  [Text] The Army of the Czech Republic is assessing the 
first year of its existence. At the same time, however, it 
cannot ignore the three preceding years. That adds up to four 
years of transformation, reorganization, and redeployments. The 
deployment of the Czechoslovak Army, in accordance with the 
adopted defense doctrine, represented the most dynamic move in 
its 75-year history. It was immediately followed by an 
unprecedented step: the division of the Army into two 
independent ones, and that in just a few months. It was not an 
easy step for a federally organized, trained, and thinking 
institution and its members. Nevertheless, the Army managed to 
complete the task, not only in a respectable, but also in a 
professional manner. 
<H5>  Two Favorable Premises </H5>
  The Czech Army is no longer the target of criticism it was 
in 
the first post-November years. It has two strong premises for 
its further development: a new concept and an approved budget. 
  Moreover, the new concept of the Army is linked to a 
relatively well thought out organizational structure. The Army 
consists of two ground forces formations (with the command in 
Tabor and Olomouc), a tactical air force formation, an air 
defense formation, a rapid deployment brigade, and a logistics 
formation. The strength of the Army is to be gradually reduced 
to 65,000 men. It seems that in many respects the internal 
structure of the Defense Ministry also corresponds to the 
findings of modern theories of organization and management and 
the experience of the armies of advanced democratic countries. 
A certain excess in the strength of the logistics units is, 
however, somewhat surprising (particularly if the low budget for 
this sphere is considered) when the strategic and social 
management branches seem to be lacking. Nor should the size of 
the Defense Ministry and its directly subordinate bodies remain 
outside future consideration. 
  A budget in the amount of 27 billion korunas -- or 
approximately 2.7 percent of the gross national product -- was 
approved for the Army. While this amount does not exceed 3 
percent, it is in harmony with the neighbors and advanced 
democratic countries. It must be noted, however, that in the 
comparison with the armies of the Western countries, we are 
comparing the incomparable on the absolute scale. Their budget 
is actually several times higher, just as is their gross 
national product. Nevertheless, we can only afford to 
distribute what we have. Internal destabilization of the 
country can be just as great a danger as an external threat. 
Moreover, many prominent officials are inclined to further 
reduce the Army budget in favor of the Interior Ministry because 
the crime situation is the most criticized sphere of the state 
executives' operation. After all, it cannot be overlooked that 
many citizens doubt the need for an army in general. 
  Considering the actual external security risks and dangers, 
doing without the Army would be conceivable. Are we able, 
however, to predict security development on a long-term or even 
a shorter-term basis? Unfortunately, that is not possible in a 
dynamically developing world and Europe. A combat-ready army, 
then, certainly cannot be built from one day to the next. It 
takes long years. 
  Given this situation, the responsible bodies and the 
citizens 
will demand that the Army's budget be used as effectively as 
possible, and that it is reflected in the level of security and 
defense, in the standard of training and discipline. 
<H5>  The Criterion Will Always Be the Results </H5>
  If fundamental, even if minimum, there are prerequisites for 
the future of the Army and they must be applied. Because of 
existing and expected risks, it seems that the formation of the 
rapid deployment brigade has a certain priority. At the same 
time, it will be a criterion for the command's ability to 
gradually professionalize the troops. 
  Why is it a criterion? It is nothing new that professional 
soldiers, objectively considered, have suffered social 
insecurity for several years. It is objective because they 
first served the totalitarian regime and, moreover, the Army has 
traditionally considered the military profession to be a 
life-long career. That completely contradicts, however, the 
demands of military service and the experience of Western 
democratic armies. Therefore the transformation of the Army 
meant not only parting with those who seriously discredited 
themselves under the past regime, but also the gradual creation 
and implementation of a new service concept. 
  A certain personnel crisis in the Army is testified to by 
the 
statement by Defense Minister Baudys, for instance, in 
connection with the possible filling of vacancies in the NATO 
command in Brussels: Finding 30 to 40 able officers is a 
tremendous problem. 
  The interest of young people in serving in the rapid 
deployment brigade will show whether the social insecurity of 
active duty soldiers has also affected the general atmosphere 
about interest in the military profession. It is possible to 
observe a rather uncontrolled process insofar as Army personnel 
management is concerned, whereby those who should stay leave, 
and those who should leave, particularly the older ones, remain. 
This situation is certainly not helped by incessant 
deliberation over which current benefits the professional 
soldiers should lose. If we want to plan a professional army 
for the future, we must expect it to cost something, and this 
does not mean only direct expenditures on the Army, but also 
rewarding those who served in the Army (a professional in the 
U.S. Army, for instance, receives altogether more after his 
transfer to the reserves than the pay he drew as an active duty 
soldier). 
  The future of the Army of the Czech Republic is tied to the 
development of NATO. This approach dominated the post-November 
developments, and was reinforced more recently. NATO itself, 
however, is searching for a profile and a new concept. It 
certainly needs time for that. Nevertheless, due to dynamic 
development in the postcommunist countries, time is a scarce 
commodity. One of the reasons is the uneven progress of the 
democratization process in these countries. It is precisely 
because of this dynamics that some politicians, military 
experts, and journalists considered the January Summit on the 
issue of new membership premature. 
  Nevertheless, it took place, and that is a certain promise 
for the future because the Partnership for Peace plan has 
accepted, more or less emphatically, all relevant countries. 
  Because of its relatively better political and economical 
situation, our republic attempted to get preferential treatment 
in joining NATO. That testifies to a certain not very faithful 
reflection of the existing situation. NATO, and particularly 
the United States, probably do not differ on this; they prefer a 
more coordinated approach of the Visegrad Four member countries. 
<H5>  Relations With NATO </H5>
  Therefore we were lined up from the start on the same level 
with the others. The military aspects of approaching NATO can 
play a more important part here, and the other countries have 
apparently done better in the overall transformation of the 
Army. Moreover, in counterpoint to us, they began to join 
together, as demonstrated by a statement made by Polish 
President Walesa during the Warsaw visit by Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky immediately after the talks in Prague: 
Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia will find a common language. If 
other countries in this part of Europe do not wish to follow the 
same route at this time, they will learn later that cooperation 
is advantageous. 
  We have certainly progressed in recent years in our 
relationship with NATO -- in our mutual relations, exchanges, 
the training of our soldiers at military schools in NATO 
countries, etc. Nevertheless, NATO members do not focus only on 
how membership would guarantee our security, but consider also 
the contribution to the European Community. Therefore, they are 
interested in the state of the armies of the former Warsaw Pact, 
the quality of their training and arms, discipline, and, above 
all, the reliability and quality of the leadership. At the 
center of attention is, above all, the extent of civilian 
control of the Army and who is entrusted with the Army command 
(which is why we observed a certain anxiety in the West 
regarding changes at the Polish Ministry of Defense etc.). 
Similar critical reactions also appear in our media. 
  If the Czech Army is to guarantee the security, defense, and 
sovereignty of the state, and thereby also democratic 
development, it has a long way to go, particularly with respect 
to internal democratic transformation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by John Hibbs: "Consumers Still Not Kings"] </F>
  [Text] If the reader of this article can correctly answer 
the following question then he or she has rare insight into 
doing business in the Czech Republic. 
  The question is this: How many sales representatives work 
for 
Staropramen, the largest brewery in Prague? 
  Those who give an answer in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 
make 
an intelligent guess, as that is about how many front-line 
salespeople work for similar-sized breweries in Amsterdam, 
Munich, Bristol, St. Louis and Perth. 
  Those who answer with a number in the 90 to 120 range also 
have a logical basis for their conclusion. Commonly, the 
formerly state-run factories of Eastern and Central Europe 
employ two or three times the number of workers as do their 
Western counterparts. 
  But the truly shrewd observer of affairs in this part of the 
world recognizes the hazards of automatically linking Western 
operating practices to the situation here. This is particularly 
so when it comes to the subject of marketing, which of course is 
barely a four-year-old concept for Czechs. 
  Thus, the foreigner familiar with the way things are done 
here would not be surprised at the number of sales reps at 
Staropramen. That number is zero, zip, nada, none. Not a single 
full-time employee at the brewery has the sole function of 
making regular calls to either distributors or retailers. 
  How can this be? Staropramen is a professionally run, 
century-old brewery with an excellent product. Its production 
processes are modern and cost-efficient. Senior management is 
motivated and the work force is diligent. So how can they not 
have even one front-line sales specialist? 
  At first, those of us who are from the West might be tempted 
to chuckle. After all, "everyone" understands that sales--and 
salespeople--are the absolute lifeblood of any business. 
"Everyone" knows that basic operating decisions are dictated by 
the demands of the market, which must be monitored constantly 
through face-to-face contact with customers. 
  "Everyone" knows this, provided of course that "everyone" 
has 
grown up in places where consumers are pampered by endless 
supplies of goods and services. The West is where the butcher 
works incredibly hard to provide the best meat, the baker the 
best bread, and the candlestick maker the best candle. For those 
who grew up where there were more plumbers than leaky faucets, 
more mechanics than broken cars, more phones than callers, these 
are simple truths. In the West, it is an unchallenged dictum 
that the customer is king and that the road to wealth is open 
only to those who strive for entrepreneurial excellence and aim 
to leave the customer fully satisfied. 
  But "everyone" didn't grow up in that kind of environment. 
For more than four decades, the Central and Eastern European 
supplier was not just king but kingmaker. With goods always in 
short supply, the customer was either ignored or looked down 
upon. The masters were those who held the keys to the inventory; 
the subject were the masses, who were always stuck on the 
outside looking in. 
  This goes a long way toward explaining why people waiting in 
line to pay for their groceries at the neighborhood 
potraviny (grocery store) are so well-behaved or why 
the waiter is so surly and shop hours so short. The imprint of 
40 years of demand exceeding supply is deep, and lasting. 
  The men and women inside Staropramen were not inoculated 
against this. It should be no wonder that, more often than not, 
their customers are viewed as a nuisance. Or that sales tactics 
commonly used by Anheuser-Busch and McDonald's are perceived as 
frivolous and wasteful. What value can a salesperson's call 
report have in a society indoctrinated to place such little 
value on the customer? 
  Soon, of course, the rigors of capitalism will force 
themselves on Prague's business managers. When this happens, as 
it must, they will discover that the customer is fickle, 
demanding and unbelievably smart. Then wise managers will listen 
carefully to the message brought to them by their front-line 
sales force. 
  The point of all this, it seems to me, is that the task for 
us resident foreigners is never to forget that, for Staropramen 
and other Czech enterprises, the cake has been turned upside 
down. Putting the customer at the head of the parade is not 
easily done, as proven before by the sharp guys in Detroit who 
once ignored this basic requirement. 
  Seen in this light, what is astonishing is that change has 
been so rapid. The progress so far is a near miracle. Perhaps 
what is most in order is applause, not snickers.

  [Editorial Report] The development of a new Polish 
encryption system for military communications that is compatible 
with NATO secure communications systems was reported in a 28 
February Polish television news broadcast. According to TV 
Polonia's "Wiadomosci" program, the new digital system will 
permit the transmission of encoded messages by telephone and 
radio within the Polish military and government, as well as to 
compatible foreign systems. The development of the encryption 
system was financed by the Ministry of National Defense and the 
Committee for Scientific Research. Deputy Communications 
Minister Marek Rusin told "Wiadomosci" that "this system is 
three times cheaper than similar ones used in the West, and its 
quality is competitive with NATO standards."

<F P=106> [Article by Agata Nowakowska: "Union Preparing Manifesto"] </F>
  [Text] A statement issued by the members of the Presidium 
of the Democratic Union (UD) after their 30 January meeting 
asserts that the end of the current government coalition will 
leave the country with debts, increased inflation and 
unemployment, and postponed reform in the education, health, and 
insurance systems, and local governments losing their power to 
centralized authority. 
  The UD Presidium empowered its deputies to submit a draft 
law 
on county [powiat] governments to the Sejm. The Presidium also 
called on all supporters of Solidarity reforms to "mobilize 
forces" in the June local government elections. The UD decided 
at its electoral conventions to name candidates for the councils 
together with the KLD (Liberal Democratic Congress). Hanna 
Suchocka urged members to arouse themselves from their torpor 
and to get to work. 
  According to Jerzy Osiatynski, former Minister of Finance, 
the current government is able to do only one thing--raise 
taxes. "Under the slogan of fighting unemployment, the 
government introduced a lump-sum tax for small companies. In 
1993, 1 million people found work thanks to these companies. 
Now, the entrepreneurs are deregistering their firms," charged 
Osiatynski. He also warned against a rise in inflation brought 
about by the "nonchalant attitude of the government to the 
popiwek [excess wage growth tax that government plans to stop as 
of 31 March]." 
  The halt in privatization and the bad climate surrounding it 
were deplored. One Presidium member lamented, "Minister of 
Agriculture Andrzej Smietanko is torpedoing attempts to 
privatize the tobacco industry." Another complained, "The person 
named to head the commission for ownership transformation is 
Bogdan Pek from the PSL [Polish Peasant Party], who knows 
nothing about privatization." 
  The UD Presidium also expressed indignation concerning the 
government's personnel policy as a return of the "old, PRL-style 
functionaries [PRL referring to the Polish People's Republic, 
the official name of the Polish state in the communist era]" and 
"a purge of voivodes conducted according to party criteria." 
  Waldemar Kuczynski [former privatization minister and 
current 
member of the UD Presidium] stated that a joint UD-KLD 
commission is preparing a declaration "in the poetics of a 
manifesto" for the unification congress. It will consist of two 
parts: "Poland five years after the fall of communism" (the 
achievements and defeats of the Solidarity governments) and 
"Poland of tomorrow" (the vision of the state according to the 
new party). He added that the commission is looking for some 
kind of catchy slogan, playing on national ambitions, something 
in the style of "Polska gola" ["Polish goal," the refrain called 
out by soccer fans during international meets]. 
  For each KLD delegate at the congress, there will be 2.7 
delegates from the UD. In the 100-person Executive Council, 
there will be 73 former members of the UD and 27 former KLD 
members. "We haven't yet given up on the idea of inviting 20-25 
so-called notables to the congress," UD secretary Andrzej 
Machowski told GAZETA.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "People": "Barbara </F>
Labuda"] 
  [Text] The Association for Rights and Freedom, which is 
chaired by Barbara Labuda, is opposed to the Sejm ratification 
of the concordat [with the Vatican]. A portion of the circle 
that has been, until now, well disposed toward Labuda, 
criticized her for the statement that those who put the 
concordat together "must have been convinced that the church is 
the lord of the state." In her opinion, there is no trace of a 
partnership between Poland and the Vatican in the document. 
  Barbara Labuda is 48 years old. She completed the Department 
of Romance Philology at Wroclaw University and studied literary 
history, sociology, and political science in France for three 
years. After her return to Poland, she worked as an assistant at 
her alma mater. In 1984, following her earlier forced dismissal 
from work, she defended her doctoral dissertation. Beginning in 
1976, she was active in KOR [Committee for the Defense of the 
Workers], whose ideas she propagated during her stay in France. 
She was the organizer of the Workers University [Wszechnica 
Pracownicza] and the "Tygiel" discussion club. She also 
organized the political club "Freedom, Justice, Independence." 
She participated in the work of the NSZZ Solidarity Regional 
Strike Committee of Lower Silesia and the TKK (Provisional 
Coordinating Committee [part of the Solidarity underground]) 
throughout Poland. As adviser to the Lower Silesia Solidarity, 
she had to go into hiding when martial law was declared. She was 
arrested together with Wladyslaw Frasyniuk and was sentenced to 
prison for one and a half years. After her release, she 
continued to be active in the Solidarity underground. She was 
one of the leaders of ROAD [Citizens Movement-Democratic Action, 
founded in early 1990, forerunner to the Democratic Union (UD)]. 
While heading the Parliamentary Women's Group, she initiated the 
resolution governing the draft referendum allowing for abortions. 
  Labuda is married and has one son.

<F P=106> [Joint declaration: "Center Accord-PSL (Polish Peasant </F>
Party)-Peasant Accord-Christian National Union: Economic and 
Social Principles"] 
  [Text] A crucial prerequisite for the attainment of worthy 
national, social, and personal aspirations is a strong and 
growing economy. Its formation must be promoted by a proper 
policy of the state. 
  1. The state must provide the conditions for the growth of 
an 
economy which shall be dominated by private ownership of 
manufacturing, commercial, and service establishments. 
  1.1. Once the share of the private sector in the Polish 
economy exceeds 50 percent in terms of both employment and 
generation of national income, its further growth should be 
principally decided by the increase in the number and size of 
family-owned enterprises (and farms) in agriculture, industry, 
trade, and services. In addition to eliminating the impediments 
to freedom of private enterprise under law it is necessary for 
the government to pursue a tax policy that supports the growth 
of private business and promotes business investments. 
  The experience of many countries proves that, in order to 
grow, small business needs a policy of credit preferences by 
means of credit-price subsidies, the creation of a system of 
credit guarantees and of the institutions providing such 
guarantees, and the building of an infrastructure supporting the 
private sector in terms of consultantcy 33 and promotion. 
  1.2. Of special importance to not only the growth of the 
private sector but also to righting a fundamental wrong is the 
reprivatization of the property seized by the communists--in 
kind whenever possible or in monetary or material form whenever 
so dictated by social considerations. 
  1.3. The privatization of "socialized" plants should be 
continued upon promoting in particular employee privatization 
which turns broad strata of the population into proprietors. 
  2. An important objective of government policy should be the 
promotion of investment by foreign capital whenever this means 
creating new jobs, opening access to foreign markets for Polish 
goods and producers, and introducing new technologies in our 
country. 
  2.1. A basic prerequisite for attracting major capital 
investment to Poland is the stability of tax laws, and 
especially of the income-tax and VAT rates. 
  2.2. In general, individually negotiated tax and duty 
exemptions should be eliminated and regular tax and fee rebates 
should be introduced for investors--also through the 
establishments of various kinds of economic zones and areas. 
  2.3. The protection of the domestic market should be 
strengthened and the practice of establishing duty-free quotas 
for domestically manufactured finished products abandoned. 
  3. Spending on science and education should be treated as 
capital 
investment. 
  3.1. Research subsidies provided by the state budget should 
enable our science to stay abreast of the accomplishments of 
world science. 
  3.2. Support by means of subsidies, tax exemptions, or duty 
exemptions should be provided to both basic research in 
particular domains and applied R&amp;D work. 
  3.3. Support by means of both tax policy and subsidies 
should 
be provided to educational centers and students. 
  4. Economic policy should promote optimal conditions for 
economic cooperation with the countries of the European Union, 
these being most favorable to Poland. 
  5. In current economic policy an particularly important 
objective is to combat unemployment, and especially unemployment 
among young people. 
  5.1. Special protection by means of economic instruments 
should be provided to domestic manufacturers and products. 
  5.2. By means of a broad variety of instruments ranging from 
the policy on currency rates of exchange through tax exemptions 
and credit 3I3 preferences to diplomatic moves, exports of 
Polish products and services should be promoted. 
  5.3. Tax and credit preferences should promote production 
for 
export. 
  5.4. Tax and credit policy should promote investment to an 
extent sufficing to halt the growth in unemployment in 1994 and 
to reduce unemployment by at least 1 million in 1995. 
  5.5. Tax preferences should be granted for investments in 
regions with highest unemployment. 
  5.6. A program for building superhighways on the basis of 
non-state financing should be initiated. 
  5.7. A program for training unemployed young people 16 to 23 
years old should be initiated most urgently. 
  6. Strengthening the family should be a long-range objective 
of social policy, and it should be promoted by economic policy. 
  6.1. Family allowances should be preserved as an entitlement 
for which all families with underage children and child-raising 
homemakers are eligible. 
  6.2. The legal minimum wage should assure decent living 
conditions for the employee and, when family allowances are 
included, also for his/her family. 
  6.3. Tax policy should strengthen family life by means of a 
joint tax return for all persons living in a joint household. 
  7. Social policy should assure the material security of 
retirees. The traditional ratio of retirement pensions to the 
mean wage should be retained, and they should be subject to 
cost-of-living adjustments. 
  7.1. Similar protection should be extended to sickness 
benefits, especially for persons who cannot support themselves 
by working. 
  7.2. The state should promote the growth of private 
insurance 
companies. 
  8. All citizens should be guaranteed a minimum of health 
care. 
  8.1. The universal nature of health care should be assured 
by 
universal compulsory health insurance. 
  8.2. Citizens should have access to additional group and 
individual insurance. 
  9. Social policy should promote, by means of various 
instruments, adequate housing with allowance for the financial 
possibilities of individual citizens. 
  9.1. The state should promote the growth of credit 
institutions and the purchases of housing, and it should pursue 
a tax policy promoting 33 housing construction and personal 
spending on housing (also by means of a credit and payment 
system). 
  9.2. Local governments should, upon appropriate support from 
the state budget, expand the infrastructure of land development 
and housing and support the construction of private rental 
housing. 
  10. Employees of the state administration, the procurature, 
the judiciary, the police, and the military, as well as teachers 
should be afforded special protection of their occupations and 
incomes. 
  11. Current social policy should principally focus on 
alleviating the consequences of the unfavorable development of 
the economic situation, and especially the consequences of 
unemployment and inflationary growth of the cost of living.

<F P=106> [Declaration of joint program of the Party of Christian </F>
Democrats, Conservative Party, Peasant-Christian Party, and 
Union for Real Politics: "Accord of 11 November"] 
  [Text] Like any other periodical, LAD is the 
recipient of numerous and varied resolutions, declarations, and 
press releases issued by the political parties. We adopted the 
rule not to publish them, as otherwise LAD would turn into a 
partisan publication. But now we are making an exception to this 
rule, in order to present the joint program of four center-right 
parties (PChD [Party of Christian Democrats], PK [Conservative 
Party], SLCh [Peasant-Christian Party], and UPR [Union for Real 
Politics]). We are doing this for several reasons. First, 
because it is an interesting document. Second, because it is the 
fruit of that cooperation among several rightist groupings which 
we have been so assiduously promoting. And lastly, third, we 
pledged to do so in response to the polemics of Mr. Pawel 
Laczkowski. We shall make a second exception to our rule when in 
our next issue we publish the program resulting from the accord 
among other center-right parties, namely, among the 
Christian-National Union, the Center Accord, the Labor Party, 
and the Movement for the Republic. We would of course be even 
more gratified were we able to publish prior to the 
parliamentary elections in a joint program of all the eight 
parties. While there is life there is hope.... LAD 
  We the undersigned representatives of the Party of Christian 
Democrats, the Conservative Party, the Peasant-Christian Party, 
and the Union for Real Politics, referring to the desire to 
cooperate as expressed in the Accord of 11 November 1993, 
perceive the need to build the political bloc of the Right 
together with all the groupings and constituencies accepting the 
view that Poland can no longer remain the staging area for 
socialist experiments, and that the foundation of social order 
is freedom, private ownership, and respect for national 
traditions. 
<H5>  The Sociopolitical System </H5>
  1. The purpose of the state is to provide safeguards for the 
liberty and security of the persons within its reach. The state 
accomplishes these ends by: 
  --Establishing a constitution and a legal system that 
respects the natural rights of man, such as life, liberty, and 
property. 
  --Establishing an independent judiciary whose purpose is to 
protect these rights against the arbitrariness of other 
authorities and fellow citizens. 
  --Establishing the legislative and executive branches of 
government and defining their respective powers (division of 
powers); we champion a presidential-parliamentary system, with 
the president elected by direct, popular vote, which we also 
recommend for local-government executives. 
  --Decentralization of governance by augmenting the powers of 
local governments. 
  --Establishing armed forces, whose purpose is to protect 
national sovereignty and the independence and integrity of the 
state. 
  --Establishing police forces whose purpose is to enforce 
laws 
and judicial rulings. 
  --Establishing special services protecting the state against 
infiltration by foreign agents and counteracting attempts at 
treason. 
  2. With a view toward an unambiguous and cohesive nature of 
the legal system, we affirm that: 
  --All branches of government should refrain from interfering 
with the domain of man's liberties as defined by natural rights, 
unless dictated by the need to protect the life, liberty, or 
property of other persons; this applies in particular to 
parental rights, freedom of conscience and religion, freedom of 
engaging in private enterprise, freedom of agreements, freedom 
of science, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement. 
  For that reason, we deem necessary: 
  --A consistent adherence to the principle of equality of 
citizens before the law. 
  --Acknowledgment of the principle that the state, the Roman 
Catholic Church, and other religious denominations are 
autonomous institutions governed by their own separate rules, 
and that cooperation between the state and the Church is 
desirable for the good of the citizens. 
  --Elimination of group privileges, including the privileges 
of trade unions. 
  --Decentralization of the educational system by enhancing 
the 
influence that can be exerted by parents on the curriculums and 
creating the conditions for the growth of private schools. 
  --Banning arbitrariness in granting publishing, radio, and 
television licenses. 
  --Separation of social insurance from the state budget. 
  --Augmenting the professionalization of the army. 
  --Acknowledging the need to respect freedom of agreements 
and 
prohibiting the regimentation of business; monopolies and 
concessions breed crime and, because they conflict with the 
principle of free competition, they hobble economic growth. 
  --Acknowledging the principle that business and professional 
activities may not be restricted by compulsory membership in 
associations of businessmen or professionals. 
<H5>  Economic Structure </H5>
  1. In acknowledging that, side by side with rule of law, 
private ownership is a guarantee of autonomy of the individual, 
national prosperity, and stability of government, we deem 
necessary the propagation of private ownership by means of: 
  --Reprivatization, comprising the restitution of property to 
persons deprived of it in the past owing to actions of 
authorities motivated by class prejudices. Restitution in kind 
should not include the property transferred to physical persons 
under the land reform. 
  --Extensive privatization of the state sector, with the 
exception of the elements needed for proper governance in a 
state with a market economy. 
  2. As to monetary policy, we deem necessary: 
  --Regulation of money supply by adapting it to the scope of 
economic growth. 
  --A lasting elimination of the budget deficit. 
  --Prohibition against any fixing of currency exchange rates 
and prices by the government. 
  3. In affirming that income is subject to ownership, we 
believe that 
  --Taxes should be spent solely on purposes that are equally 
useful to everyone. 
  --Taxes should be levied solely by legislation. 
  --Along with a reduction in fiscal encumbrances, progressive 
taxation should be gradually eliminated. 
  --Multiple taxation of income conflicts with the principle 
of 
protection of ownership and therefore the inheritance tax, the 
gift tax, and the tax on the acquisition of property rights 
should be immediately abolished. 
  --Farming is a strategic branch of the economy and at the 
same time is a branch that is slower in adapting itself to 
market requirements during the transition period. It should be 
afforded conditions protecting its competitiveness. 
  4. While we acknowledge the importance of the scale of 
fiscal 
encumbrances to economic growth and national prosperity, we deem 
necessary 
  --An immediate reduction of taxes to an extent adapted to 
the 
pace of privatization of the state sector. 
  --A change in the tax system consisting in its maximum 
simplification so as to eliminate the need to audit incomes and 
reduce to a minimum the cost of collecting taxes as well as 
simplify said collecting. 
  5. Any deprivation or restriction of ownership may take 
place 
solely on the basis of or by executing a judicial ruling issued 
when the owner perpetrates a felony or fails to implement a 
contractual or legal obligation. 
<H5>  Traditions </H5>
  1. In affirming the Christian nature of our civilization, 
whose principal feature is tolerance, we acknowledge the need to 
take into consideration in public life the good of the family, 
the protection of human life, and moral order. 
  2. In acknowledging that the Fatherland is a legacy to which 
we are the heirs and therefore bear the obligation of 
transmitting it to future generations, we emphasize the need for 
individual contributions to the accomplishments of our nation 
and in particular for enhancing its prestige among the nations 
of the world by contributing to its might and laying the 
economic foundations for national independence. 
<H5>  Raison d'Etat </H5>
  We support cooperation based on the free flow of people, 
capital, and goods across the boundaries of sovereign states 
with competing tax systems and national currencies. We declare 
our support for the political forces in Europe and the world 
which champion free international trade, and we declare our 
readiness to cooperate with them in achieving that goal. 
  2. In acknowledging the need to rely primarily on our own 
forces, we deem it necessary to base the safeguards for our 
national security on the existing military structures that 
protect the principles of our civilization. 
  3. We desire to foster amicable relations with all the 
neighbors of the Polish Republic on the principle of mutual 
respect of national interests, in the belief that such friendly 
cooperation is a major premise for the growth of our countries 
and the prosperity of our nations.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Peasants to the Right"] </F>
  [Text] It appears that, before long, the only peasant 
party remaining will be the PSL (Polish Peasant Party). Other 
groups, until recently willing to appeal to the peasant 
tradition, today renounce the "class character" and prefer to 
call themselves nationwide parties. In seeking their place 
rather in the center or on the right of the political spectrum, 
they place themselves within broader alliances as their "peasant 
legs." 
<H5>  Kaczynski's Peasant Activists </H5>
  PSL-Peasant Accord (PSL-PL), the group led by Gabriel 
Janowski, entered the center right bloc called forth by Center 
Accord (PC) and the Christian-National Union (ZChN). The 
right-wing tendencies of the PSL-PL do not, however, apply to 
its economic program. Janowski's group is against the "overly 
strong" competition in Polish agriculture. The president of this 
party maintains that "our farmer is sufficiently innovative, and 
it is not necessary to flog him with the whip of competition." 
Also for this reason, Gabriel Janowski, former minister of 
agriculture (in the Olszewski and Suchocka governments), strived 
to introduce measures to protect the peasants against foreign 
competition, favoring the introduction of compensatory payments, 
fighting for minimum prices and for establishing the Fund for 
Farm Restructuring and Debt Reduction (FRiOR). The PSL-PL 
leader, on the other hand, is against "the ideological 
privatization of the PGR's (the state farms)." He thinks that 
the land should not end up in the hands of people with no 
connection to agriculture. 
  The right-wing tendencies of the PL manifests itself in the 
ideological sphere. The PL is closely tied to the Catholic 
Church and was even viewed as the "peasant leg of the ZChN," 
although, despite attempts by both parties, it did not result in 
the formation of an electoral coalition of these parties before 
19 September [the date of the parliamentary elections of 1993]. 
Janowski's party, underscoring its ties to Catholicism, 
supported the introduction into legal acts of the obligation to 
comply with Christian values and today resists the proposed 
compromises to the abortion law. The right-wingedness of the 
PSL-PL also is based on its relationship to communism--the party 
leaders are advocates of decommunization, and the party deputies 
voted in favor of the lustration resolution. Those among the 
PL's politicians who found themselves on Macierewicz's list 
[Antoni Macierewicz, minister of internal affairs in the 
Olszewski government, who produced a list of people he claimed 
had cooperated with the secret police in the communist 
government], even if, like Antoni Furtak, they won their suit 
against the Ministry of Internal Affairs, were not among the 
candidates for Sejm deputy in the September elections. 
  The position of the PSL-PL in the alliance called forth by 
the PC and the ZChN is rather weak. It became further weakened 
when the "tripartite accord" was transformed into a "quaternary 
accord" (Romuald Szeremietiew of the RDR [Movement for the 
Republic] entered). Today the PL fulfills the rolls of the 
"peasant leg" of the future federation of right-wing parties, 
which want to be open also to rural centers. Even though its 
leaders claim that the PL has about 20,000 members (hence a 
rather large party), the election results of 2.37 percent do not 
testify to its strength. 
  Waldemar Pawlak's Polish Peasant Party is not, according to 
PSL-PL activists, an authentic peasant party but, rather, a 
group that emerged from the rural nomenklatura. In 
the best case, Pawlak's PSL is described as a leftist party, in 
opposition to the rightist or centrist Solidarity-based peasant 
parties. Former PSL-PL Senator Janusz Woznica thinks "the PSL is 
a leftist party with a ZSL [United Peasant Party, the peasant 
party allowed under communism, hence considered compromised] 
lineage, the PL has a center lineage, and the SLCh 
(Peasant-Christian Party) has a rather rightist countenance." 
<H5>  Korwin's Peasant Activists </H5>
  The other right-wing bloc--the "11 November Accord," 
established by UPR (Union for Real Politics), the PChD (Party of 
Christian Democrats), and the PK (Conservative Party)--also has 
its "peasant leg"--namely, the very same SLCh of Jozef Slisz and 
Artur Balazs mentioned by Woznica [UPR is headed by Janusz 
Korwin Mikke, hence the name in the subtitle]. In its program, 
the SLCh clearly states, however, that it is not a peasant party 
but a "nationwide" party. "The problems of the functioning of 
the state are for us more important than the defense of the 
interests of career farmers," states SLCh deputy chairman Artur 
Balazs. He does not, however, hide the fact that his party 
emerged from the countryside, that it was formed as an 
alternative to the ZSL, and that it continues to maintain this 
formula. Slisz's and Balazs's party from the very beginning saw 
itself on the right side of the political scene and came out for 
procapitalist changes and integration with the EC. The SLCh is 
the only party with a rural lineage that cites Leszek 
Balcerowicz [former minister of finance and deputy premier, 
whose economic program set the reform in motion]. The party even 
published a lecture by the former minister given at a seminar 
dealing with the future of the Polish countryside. 
  The party's ties to the Catholic Ghurch are strong (as 
underscored by the adjective "Christian" in its name), but 
Balazs states that he understands Christianity to mean a 
catalogue of moral principles. 
  "The PSL is a group with a leftist lineage, and it also 
implements that kind of program," says Artur Balazs, when asked 
to evaluate other peasant parties. "The PL is found on the right 
side of the political scene, but its program clearly differs 
from ours in that it is directed primarily toward the defense of 
peasant interests." 
  The influences of the SLCh in the countryside are not the 
greatest, even though the party admits to having about 20,000 
members (like the PL). "We do not propose easy solutions, and we 
do not promise universal, preferential, 10-percent credits. We 
think that the process of economic transformation must equally 
involve the countryside. This pertains to changes in agrarian 
structures and technical infrastructures--we are in favor of a 
modern countryside, simply stated, a European one," explains 
Balazs, who maintains that time will verify the electoral 
promises of the SLCh's opposition and that rural support for the 
SLCh will increase in two or perhaps three years.

<F P=106> [Article by PAD: "`S' on the Elections"] </F>
  [Text] Solidarity's National Commission Presidium is of the 
opinion that the trade union should not put forth an independent 
list of candidates in the coming [June] local elections. The 
regional structures will decide on their own how to take part in 
the elections. 
  Piotr Zak, Solidarity spokesman, said, "These opinions 
result 
from an internal union polling. The regional authorities will 
make the final decision because they have the best perception of 
the situation. They can support specific people or coalitions, 
or create programmatic blocs. We will allow participation in 
various coalitions, even in such that group forces ranging from 
Union of Labor [social democratic, left point of view] to Union 
for Real Politics [laissez faire, free market point of view]." 
Zak underscored the fact that the Solidarity trade union is a 
attractive partner, having at its disposal almost 2 million 
members, a structure of several thousand factory commissions, 
and a printing base. He added, "We want groups that emerged from 
Solidarity to win in these elections; therefore, the stronger 
the local alliances, the greater their chances for success. It 
would be inadvisable to give preference to one or two groups." 
  During the Tuesday (1 February) meeting, the draft of the 
state budget was also discussed. Solidarity chief Marian 
Krzaklewski said that this was a draft of continuation not of 
changes, and, for that reason, Solidarity gives it a negative 
mark. The wage regulation that is meant to take the place of the 
popiwek (excess wage tax) in the draft budget came under strong 
criticism, as an attempt to introduce a manually controlled 
economy, said Krzaklewski, adding that "OPZZ [All-Polish Trade 
Unions Agreement--the communist government-sponsored trade union 
founded in 1984] will claim that it was it that got rid of the 
popiwek." In the opinion of the Solidarity chief, the regulation 
of wages should be brought about by collective arrangements at 
the enterprise level. 
  According to initial assessments, over 20,000 trade 
unionists 
are expected to take part in the manifestation scheduled for 9 
February in Warsaw. Krzaklewski said, "Participation in the 
manifestation is open to all, but, personally, I would not be 
pleased if OPZZ activists demonstrated with us." He added that 
the Secretariat of the center-right parties has called for 
support of the Solidarity manifestation. 
  The Presidium also agreed to conduct an eight-hour strike in 
the defense industry factories this coming Thursday (3 February).

Religa"] 
  [Text] Professor Zbigniew Religa was elected the new 
president of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reform (BBWR). "As 
long as my name is already associated with the BBWR, I would 
like that this group be something I can be proud of. For this to 
be so, I realized that I would have to become active in it," 
said Senator Religa. He also stated that the BBWR would soon be 
converted into a political party. The Bloc leader to date, Jacek 
Lipinski, resigned. 
  Zbigniew Religa was born on 16 December 1938 in Miedniew. He 
graduated from the Department of Cardiosurgery of the Academy of 
Medicine in Warsaw in 1963. During the 1970's, he held research 
training positions at Mercy Hospital Rockville Center and the 
Deborah Heart and Lung Center in New York, and at Sinai Hospital 
in Detroit. He worked at, among other places, the Warsaw 
Institute of Cardiology and at the II Clinic of Cardiosurgery. 
Since 1984, he has been director of the Chair of Cardiosurgery 
at the Silesian Medical Academy in Katowice and at the 
Cardiosurgery Clinic in Zabrze. Religa established the 
Foundation for the Development of Cardiosurgery and also created 
the Research and Training Center for the purpose of research on 
biological valves and artificial hearts. He firmly established 
his popularity by organizing charity concerts. In the future, he 
plans to open an International Medical Center in Zabrze. Prof. 
Religa worked out his own method of operating on hipoplasia of 
the left side of the heart and its transplant. He is the author 
of over 50 works on the subject of cardiosurgery. In the last 
parliamentary elections, he won a record number of votes and was 
named Senate candidate under BBWR auspices. 
  Prof. Religa is married and has a son and a daughter. His 
hobby is angling.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the rubric "People": "Wojciech </F>
Laczkowski"] 
  [Text] Following the departure of Professor Andrzej Zoll, 
who was nominated for the position of president of the 
Constitutional Tribunal, the new chairman of the State Electoral 
Commission (PKW) is Professor Wojciech Laczkowski. 
  "As the new chairman, 1 will try to maintain the social 
vision the commission has had to date, and the commission should 
have identical dispositions [regulations] toward all electoral 
commissions," stated Prof. Laczkowski. He believes that the 
guarantee of neutrality and apoliticalness, as well as the PKW's 
professionalism, lies in the commission's composition, which 
consists of three judges from each of the following: the 
Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Court, and the Supreme 
Administrative Court. 
  The first matter that will face the commission under the 
leadership of its new chairman is that of clearing the accounts 
of the electoral committees. As of 11 January, only 64 of the 
176 committees have turned in their reports to the PKW. The 
legal interpretation also requires that the closing date of the 
tenure of the gmina [parish, the smallest administrative unit] 
councils be specified. It is still not known whether the time 
limit will be the same for all gminas or whether it will be 
counted individually from the day of election. 
  Prof. Laczkowski is 63 years old. He is a graduate of the 
Department of Law of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan. 
As a specialist in public law, he lectures at his alma mater and 
also at the Catholic University in Lublin. Since 1990, he has 
held the office of judge of the State Tribunal. In 1991, he 
became a member of the governing body of the General Electoral 
Commissioner. Despite his new duties, the professor says that he 
has no intention of quitting his academic work.

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislaw Marek Krolak: "The Soul Would Like To </F>
Be in Paradise"] 
  [Text] A hundred days is too short a period of time to sum 
up the Cabinet activities but long enough to notice main trends. 
At this point, Pawlak's government is in power three times 
longer than his prime ministership following the fall of the 
Olszewski government. We recall this incident not without 
reason. One can clearly see the continuation of the same 
political line: the tendency to obliterate divisions between the 
Polish People's Republic (PRL) and Poland as it is now, and a 
departure from all promises given during the election campaign. 
  The defeat of post-Solidarity parties and the poor showing 
of 
the BBWR [Nonpartly Bloc in Support of Reforms], the 
presidential party formed in such a hurry, in the 19 September 
elections allowed the left to legally take power and form a 
government. It seemed to some people that one had but to look to 
see the slogan "All power in the hands of the people's councils" 
[a communist-era slogan]." There was no lack of people who 
scared others with the return of communism. Nothing of that sort 
happened because it could not happen. But it does not mean that 
nothing happened. The most important threat is not the return of 
a sinister ideology that is still claiming victims in the 
Balkans and the Caucases but, rather, the final legalization of 
the succession inherited from the PRL. Erasing dividing lines 
between the thief and his victim, betrayal and patriotism, 
independence and subordination to a foreign power must sooner or 
later influence the country's defense and society's bearings 
[??]. 
<H5>  The Comrades Are Returning </H5>
  The first signal given to the owners of People's Poland that 
it was time to return to the scene was sent as soon as 26 
October at the swearing-in ceremony of Pawlak's government in 
the Belweder [the presidential residence]. Leszek Miller, the 
representive of the "beton'1 [hard-liners] in the PZPR [Polish 
United Workers Party] (communist party), who is, together with 
Rakowski [Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the last first secretary of the 
PZPR], accused of illegal money dealings with the Soviets to 
finance the 1989 elections, became a minister. This could appear 
to be an incident--the price Pawlak had to pay because 
Kwasniewski was too weak to pacify Miller's supporters in his 
own party. Today, unceremoniously, Miller accuses Solidarity of 
illegally receiving money from the West. The fact that the 
attorney general is his colleague from the SLD [Democratic Left 
Alliance] is of lesser importance. What is important, however, 
is that today there are many such Millers. They are in the 
government, in the central administration, and in the 
voivodships. The best example may be that of Ireneusz Sekula. 
This decision on the part of Waldemar Pawlak symbolically 
closes the period of transition that began after the 1989 
elections. It would be hard to find a clearer political message 
for a population that was under communism for 45 years. Sekula, 
appointed president of the Main Customs Office, was, in 
Rakowski's government, responsible for the creation of a legal 
base that allowed for the enfranchisement of the 
nomenklatura, and he himself is today a beneficiary 
of that decision. Pawlak's government seemd to be saying, 
paraphrasing president Walesa, "Comrades, the time of pretending 
that we are not here is over," and "Take power into your own 
hands." In such a situation, should one be surprised that local 
apparatchiks of the coalition government are throwing out 
voivodes in order to take over their jobs? This process is not 
merely the replacement of one group of people by another. The 
clientele of the SLD and the PSL [Polish Peasant Party] [the two 
parties in the governing coalition] throughout the years has 
gotten so accustomed to sinecure and power that to try to stop 
this wave could cause mutiny in its own party ranks. From the 
perspective of local, presidential, and eventually parliamentary 
elections, the state interest must lose with the interest of the 
party. For this reason, Pawlak postponed the county (powiaty) 
reform, hoping to distribute these seats after succesful 
elections in June. 
  This whole process is, in a way, completed with the return 
of 
higher security officials to the departments directly 
responsible for state security. The ridiculed and discredited 
idea of vetting has died, and it is doubtful that it will ever 
have another chance. Fortunately, there are no longer any 
Russian garrisons in Poland that served as centers for 
espionage. However, foreign press information that our country 
is an object of strong intelligence penetration confirms fears 
that foreign agents may still, in an essential way, influence 
the decisionmaking process in Poland. 
<H5>  Cynical Treatment of the Electorate </H5>
  The slogan "It doesn't have to be like this anymore" [the 
main SLD election campaign slogan] turns out to be only a 
campaign promise. The SLD treated its own electorate rather 
cynically, while the PSL, often in good faith, was promising 
farmer paradise without consideration for what the state could 
deliver. Both of these parties do not know how to fulfill these 
declarations. That demagoguery ended soon after these parties 
won the elections, and the slightly embarassed Pawlak stated in 
the Sejm that he must continue the policy of the previous 
governments. It is good, obviously, that the government does not 
intend to destroy what the other governments accomplished during 
past four years. But what is troublesome is the fact that, in 
the programs and actions of Pawlak's Cabinet, there are no new 
ideas that would stimulate faster growth. In the explanatory 
statement to the draft budget law, there is no trace left of the 
preelection rethoric on the tragic recession, growth stimulation 
through higher inflation, radical changes in the exchange rate 
of the dollar, or increased emission of the currency in order to 
cover social expenses. On the other hand, the clearly visible 
tendency in 1993 of an improvement in the state of public 
finances greatly eased the way for the start of Prime Minister 
Pawlak's government. However, because the minister of finance 
came to the conclusion that further balancing of the budget by 
means of cutting expenses was not possible, budget revenues and 
outlays were enlarged. From the current year's tax law, we know 
whence the revenues are to come. Above all, those who voted for 
the left will pay for them: consumers and small businesses. "You 
wanted new people in power, so you have it," one would like to 
say, if it were not for the fact that here we are talking about 
the poorest layers of society. 
<H5>  Who in Reality Has Power? </H5>
  Waldemar Pawlak seems to be aware of the danger of an 
outbreak of social discontent. The prime minister's expose just 
before the end of the year can be read as an expression of 
anxiety, that matters are not following the earlier forecast. 
This begs the essential question: Who in this Cabinet has the 
deciding voice? 
  Already the battle surrounding the placing of people in 
certain ministries (when Waldemar Pawlak withdrew certain people 
from the list of names given to the president and replaced them 
with SLD names) proves that nothing of importance can occur 
without Aleksander Kwasniewski's approval. I do not claim that 
the SLD leadership fulfills the role of a Politburo in relation 
to Pawlak's government. However, there is no doubt that it is 
precisely this party [SLD] that makes the strategic decisions. 
The SLD consistently guards the interests of the PRL 
nomenklatura, which now has time for an undisturbed 
strengthening of its position in the economy. Taking over 
economic control of the country's economic life, which was 
allowed by the previous governments under the rulings of this 
present Cabinet, will result in broadening and such a 
strenghtening of the structures that no changes will be possible 
in the future. The fundamentals of privatization as proposed by 
Minister Kaczmarek constitute but one example of such a policy. 
The forecast of Lech Mazewski, associated with the liberal 
circles of the previous governments, that we are moving toward a 
South American type of capitalism, where a very narrow group of 
people control the whole economy, appears to be closer to 
realization. This will support the formation of a new 
arrangement on the political scene. In the new political 
configuration, there may be found liberals from the SLD, the KLD 
[Liberal-Democratic Congress], and UD [Democratic Union]. The 
process of rapprochement of former political adversaries will 
demand time and will depend on both the presidential elections 
and the behavior of the Solidarity groups now outside 
parliament. But the common economic interest, the similar 
liberal views ideologically, and the fact that they share the 
same electorate will lead to unity and ignoring biographical 
differences. 
<H5>  The Force in Adapting Oneself </H5>
  The strength of Waldemar Pawlak's government is in accepting 
the strategy of accommodation. This government does not wish to 
antagonize either the opposition, the president, foreign 
relations, or the mass media, or even the church, whose support 
it seeks, wishing to create the impression that it is the only 
political force defending national traditions and Christian 
values. Such a strategy may bring success under the condition 
that it will not be necessary to seek support from the 
electorate. In the meantime, the presidential election will take 
place in two years' time [late 1995]; this election designates 
the time frame in which the government will have to account for 
its actions to date. In this time frame, the difference in PSL 
versus SLD interests will become clear. Both Aleksander 
Kwasniewski and Waldemar Pawlak dream about the Belweder. The 
altercations with Lech Walesa are thus unavoidable. Prime 
Minister Pawlak has no need to hurry. He is counting on the fact 
that time is on his side. He can wait--under the condition that 
the possible failure of the government will be blamed on the 
coalition partner [the SLD]. But Aleksander Kwasniewski has to 
play the same game. He looks after the businessmen but courts 
the electorate; he does not attack the church, but he pays 
careful attention to the activities of Barbara Labuda [UD 
deputy, who is outspoken in her support of abortion rights]. 
Both Pawlak and Kwasniewski have to keep in mind the fourth 
presidential candidate--without knowing yet who this person will 
be, other than Lech Walesa. How this game will end, it is hard 
to forecast at this time. If it is true, as Jacek Soska [PSL 
deputy] claims, that Waldemar Pawlak has no intellectual 
capacity at his disposal, his government is working not for him 
but for Aleksander Kwasniewski.

  [Text] The Conservative Coalition (KK)--such is the name 
given to the new Polish right-wing group that was formed 
following the secession of seven of the 15 members of the Main 
Administration of the Conservative Party (PK). They claim to 
have the support of half of the local PK affiliates. The head of 
the Coalition, Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski, would like to bring 
about a quick integration of the right, together with Center 
Accord (PC), the Christian National Union (ZChN), the RdR 
(Movement for the Republic), and the PL (Peasant Accord). The 
founding congress of the Conservative Coalition will probably 
take place in March, and Ujazdowski himself is mentioned as one 
of the chief pretenders to the leadership of the 
national-Christian right camp. 
  The 30-year-old Kazimierz Ujazdowski was born in Kielce and 
was graduated from the Department of Law of Lodz University. In 
1990 and 1991, he was secretary general of the Forum of the 
Democratic Right [FPD, founded in summer 1990; merged with ROAD, 
Citizens Movement-Democratic Action, to form UD, the Democratic 
Union party]. As a member of the presidium of the UD, he was 
deputy to the secretary general of the party. However, he 
deserted UD and, together with Aleksander Hall, created in 1992 
the Conservative Party. Before last year's September elections, 
he negotiated with the ZChN leaders to accept the Conservative 
Party into the "Ojczyzna" [Fatherland] electoral coalition, of 
which he was an ardent supporter. From that time on, a conflict 
between him and Hall grew, leading to the division in the 
Conservative Party. 
  Kazimierz Michal Ujazdowski was a Sejm deputy in the first 
term and was a member of the Parliamentary Club of the 
Democratic Union and later of the Parliamentary Club of the 
Polish Convention [Konwencja Polska, a 33-member parliamentary 
club consisting of deputies from the FPD, the PChD (Party of 
Christian Democrats), and the SL-Ch (Peasant-Christian Party)]. 
He is the founder of the "Kraj" ["Country"] association and of 
the Alexis de Tocqueville Democratic Foundation. 
  He is married and has one son. He likes to spend his free 
time reading belles lettres literature and traveling.

  [Text] The creators of the Sejm Group to Protect the 
Interests of Workers (Zespol Ochrony Interesow 
Pracowniczych--ZOIP)--Piotr Ikonowicz, chairman of the Polish 
Socialist Party [PPS], and Stanislaw Wisniewski, deputy chairman 
of the OPZZ [All-Polish Trade Unions 
Agreement--communist-government-sponsored trade union founded in 
1984]--claim that the group's creation is not to be viewed as a 
vote of no-confidence in the authorities of the SLD (Democratic 
Left Alliance) parliamentary club. However, they do not exclude 
the possibility of closer cooperation between the PPS and the 
OPZZ in the future, at the expense of the alliance with the SdRP 
(Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [the inheritor of the 
communist party and main party in the SLD]). 
  "We are not interested in factional games and scissions. We 
want only to force the SLD to correct the economic policy," says 
Ikonowicz. He foresees pressures exerted on members of his Sejm 
club and commission. At the same time, OPZZ chairman Ewa 
Spychalska formed her own group of trade unionist deputies and 
senators from within the SLD parliamentary club. 
  Piotr Ikonowicz was born in May 1956 in Pruszkow. He is a 
graduate of the Department of Law and Administration of Warsaw 
University. Following completion of his studies, he was employed 
as a reporter for NSZZ Solidarity [Independent Self-Governing 
Trade Union "Solidarity"], Mazowsze region, and also as a 
translator. In November 1987, he founded the PPS, which is bound 
to the traditions of the PPS formed in 1892. Ikonowicz publishes 
ROBOTNIK (The Worker), a publication of the Interfactory Workers 
Committee of Solidarity. He is a member of the Association of 
Polish Translators and of the Association of Polish Journalists. 
  Since November 1992, Ikonowicz has chaired the PPS Executive 
Council. In July 1993, for his role in initiating the idea of an 
electoral coalition with the SLD, against the Council's will, 
the Council wanted to dismiss him from his function as chairman 
and remove him from the party. Ikonowicz maintained his position 
and won a seat in the Sejm from the SLD list. 
  He is married and has a daughter. His hobbies are soccer and 
billiards.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrzej Szafranski: "A Run-Down Navy; Going Down </F>
With Honor?"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Going Down With Honor </H5>
  If today society wanted to present the Polish Navy with a 
submarine similar to the prewar Orzel, every citizen would have 
to turn 200,000 zlotys [Z] over to the public treasury. This 
present would be the most suitable for the Navy, which has 
somewhat under 19,000 personnel and is currently the branch of 
service with the largest shortfall in technical investment. 
Almost half of the 70 combatant units and about 60 auxiliary 
units have by all possible yardsticks exceeded their service 
lives, and, with an average age of 18 years, the shock core of 
the force makes the Navy of the Republic of Poland the oldest in 
the Baltic. In terms of personnel strength, our Navy is the 
third largest, behind those of Russia and the Federal Republic 
of Germany, but, in terms of equipment, it ranks next to last, 
ahead of Finland's, not counting the "pocket" navies of 
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. 
  There is little prospect for any radical improvement in the 
situation because expansion, to say nothing of modernization, of 
a fleet usually takes anywhere from 10 to 20 years in view of 
the tremendous costs involved. And usually, as the last units of 
the new generation are coming into service, the first are 
nearing the end of their service life. The fleet modernization 
program that was started in 1980 was gradually put on hold as 
the crisis grew worse and ultimately fell victim to the 
draconian budget cuts of recent years. 
  This neglect contributed to a drastic reduction in the 
fighting power of the Navy of the Polish Republic, as is 
especially evident now that we have to worry about defending our 
borders ourselves. In any case, the aid from our recent ally 
mainly took the form of deliveries of inferior-quality equipment 
and the imposition on us of the offensive doctrine of the Warsaw 
Pact. According to its precepts, a disproportionately large 
amphibious group numbering 40 units (23 landing craft and 17 
cutters) was set up, whose mission, together with the East 
German Volksmarine [People's Navy] and the Baltic Fleet, was to 
seize the Danish Straits. Today all that is left of that 
impressive armada is the solitary ORP [Ship of the Polish 
Republic] Grunwald, but the money spent on those "amphibious 
forces" still haunts the remaining forces of the Polish Navy. 
  In conformity with this same doctrine, during the latter 
half 
of the 1970's the coast guard removed the coastal artillery 
batteries deployed at Miedzyzdroje, Kolobrzeg, Ustka, Gdynia, 
Wisloujscie, Rozewie, and Hel Peninsula, and the Sopka 
shore-to-ship missiles that were expended were not replaced. 
  According to the prevailing naval doctrine, a small, closed 
body of water such as the Baltic requires the use of fast, 
powerful weapon systems, as well as compact units, small 
submarines, enhanced mine-warfare forces, and modern naval 
aviation. Specialists have a saying that the best type of naval 
unit for the Baltic is really...an aircraft. Unfortunately, 
right now we can only dream of creating a real naval aviation 
force. No one can take seriously the sale of 30 obsolete 
MiG-21's and An-2 reconnaissance biplanes. The only modern 
element is 10 Mi-14 PL antisubmarine helicopters. Four other 
Mi-14's, along with four Anacondas (a variation of the famous 
Sokol) and several obsolete Mi-2RM's comprise the 
search-and-rescue flotilla. To set up a search-and-rescue 
station on the western coast, the need for which was forcefully 
demonstrated by the disaster of the ferry Jan Heweliusz, the 
purchase of additional Anacondas is needed. There is no chance 
of this, however, without special budgetary assistance, because 
the Navy cannot afford to maintain a naval rotary-wing 
search-and-rescue system on its own. In spite of the meager 
resources, the cooperation between the Navy and the national 
manufacturers of aviation equipment is good, increasing the 
chances of the survival of the defense plants. In the very near 
future, this may lead to series production of the patrol version 
of the An-28 Bryz, produced in Mielec, and the combat sister of 
the Anaconda from Swidnik, equipped for conducting antisubmarine 
search operations. 
  Warships are the heart of a Navy, however. The flagship of 
the Polish Navy, the destroyer Warszawa, is a large unit but is 
equipped with basic weaponry and electronics that date back to 
the late 1950's. Because today it is not the calibers and 
numbers of the guns and missiles but, rather, the parameters of 
the combat electronics, the ranges of the radars, the weaponry 
reaction time from the instant the enemy is detected until the 
unit opens fire, and the resistance of the electronics to enemy 
jamming that are decisive as regards the combat value of a 
warship. Otherwise, its role is reduced to that of conducting 
training and ceremonial duties. The counterpart units of this 
warship, which was finished in 1970 as the Smielyj, have now 
been decommissioned from the Russian Navy. 
  The only modern submarine (ORP Orzel) is basically too large 
for the Baltic, but the two other submarines and two-thirds of 
the missile ships are basically museum pieces. The others, 
despite their good speed and excellent handling characteristics, 
are of low fighting quality due to the purchase of substandard 
electronics and a shortage of specialists. The reduction in the 
basic military obligation for the Navy did not help at all. It 
takes years to train specialists in this highly technical branch 
of the armed forces. The now-common practice of contract-based 
service is turning out to be the best and most cost-effective 
way of professionalizing the crews. We are, however, far below 
the standard of, for example, the Bundesmarine [German Navy] 
where draftees make up only 29 percent of the personnel 
strength, contract personnel account for 46 percent, and 25 
percent are professionals. 
  The newest motor torpedo boat, Orkan, admittedly has a full 
and highly qualified crew (of 36 hands, 22 are cadre) but does 
not have such a basic item of weaponry as antiship missiles. The 
Russians do not want to supply the Urans that it had promised, 
we cannot afford the ones from the West, and installing the 
obsolete and jamming-prone Styx missiles that have been used on 
the other ships makes no sense, either. 
  The complement for hunting submarines numbers 20 units "on 
paper." Unfortunately, 19 of these vessels are worn out or 
small, and, during a "surge," only two can be used to chase 
submarines--the Warszawa and the really substandard patrol 
corvette Kaszub. 
  As far as minesweepers, or ships that are designed for 
clearing mines from sea lanes, are concerned, we have 25. 
Because they are limited to operating under sea conditions of no 
more than 3 on the Beaufort scale, 15 of the new vessels with 
nonmagnetic plastic hulls are suited for the Gdansk Bay and the 
Szczecin Straits rather than the high seas. Because of wear and 
tear and the development of mine weapons, the rest are virtually 
worthless. To supplement the regular minesweepers, two fishing 
trawlers have been adapted for mine-hunting tasks. If need be, 
there is the possibility of mobilizing 70 similar fishing 
vessels. Compared to the warships, the force of 
search-and-rescue, auxiliary, and special-purpose ships is 
relatively new and fairly well equipped. 
  Of the Z3.8 trillion allocated this year for the purchase of 
equipment and weaponry for all branches of the armed forces, 
more than half has to go to the purchase of spare parts and the 
complete overhaul of equipment. The sum of Z3.8 trillion will 
purchase three-quarters of a submarine of the Kilo class (ORP 
Orzel), but the needs of the Navy are only a fraction of that 
amount. The services must carefully husband their resources in 
order to cover the costs of commissioning the motor torpedo boat 
Huragan and two minesweepers at about Z180 billion apiece and 
still put resources toward the purchase of the above-mentioned 
missile system. Next year, the last in the motor torpedo boat 
series and possibly two minesweepers will be completed. There is 
no way to hope for anything more than that. To be sure, 
consideration was being given to the possibility of immediately 
making up for the shortfalls through the purchase, if available, 
of East German corvettes, but the Germans torpedoed the deal by 
inflating the price and, subsequently, some of the ships were 
sold to Indonesia. 
  Since the change in the geopolitical situation, there is no 
longer any pressure to rely on the services of a single 
exporter, the former Soviet Union. The switch to calculating in 
dollars, quality that is below world standards, and the 
inability to guarantee the continuity of deliveries of spare 
parts for equipment that is already in use are making the CIS 
[Commonwealth of Independent States] a less than reliable 
partner. In view of the high prices, it does not appear feasible 
to import finished warships from the highly developed countries. 
A kilogram of warship minus combat equipment and electronics, 
costs more than 100 German marks [DM]. The price for one 
kilogram of this kind of equipment exceeds DM7,000. 
  The national shipyards (Polnocna, Marynarki Wojennej, Wisla) 
have the appropriate experience and, in the absence of orders, 
could immediately pick up the construction of the warships 
needed by the fleet, except for submarines. Even if resources 
were unexpectedly allocated to a program for modernizing the 
naval forces, given the current traditional structure that has 
resulted in a collection of highly specialized, obsolete 
warships and replacing them with new ones would take at least 
several years. 
  Possibly the way out of the situation would be to look to 
the 
Danish experiments. Faced with the necessity of replacing a 
large portion of the Danish Navy, instead of designing new types 
of traditional warships, they shifted away from the previous 
approach and decided to limit the number and variety of ships 
without reducing the capabilities of the naval defense forces in 
the process. This was accomplished by building a series of 
all-purpose Standard Flex warships that can, in a few hours, 
alter their functions by installing modular containers holding 
items of equipment and weaponry. Depending on what is needed, a 
ship can operate as a patrol vessel, a search-and-rescue unit, a 
pollution-control vessel, a missile unit, a subchaser, a 
minelayer, and a minesweeper. For a country that has scarce 
budget resources and a relatively small fleet, this approach is 
virtually ideal. However, even in the event that the national 
shipyards are commissioned to build the ships, if we dreamed of 
owning ships of close to world-class level, there is no getting 
away from importing the electronic-warfare equipment. The 
country produces modern radars, good sonars of the Flaming 
series, and highly accurate Szop navigation gear (accurate to 
within 0.5 meter), but these are only a few of the items that 
are needed. 
  The situation is worse with regard to weaponry because, for 
example, the Wrobel surface-to-air missile-artillery system has 
a long reaction time, on the order of tens of seconds, and can 
be used only against a target that has already launched an 
attack and is flying away. The Russian "last chance" guns 
currently in use are not economical, and Western ones (for 
example, the Goalkeeper, firing 4,200 rounds a minute, with a 
reaction time of 1 second) are excessively expensive. Work on 
the Polish Nawalnik was halted four years ago due to a shortage 
of funds. 
  How can we think of modernizing the fleet when there is not 
even enough money for fuel? The destroyer Warszawa has an engine 
with an output of 94,000 horsepower, or the same as 1,150 
1.5-liter Polonaise cars. Sailing "100" [kilometers] at cruising 
speed requires 11 tons of fuel; at top speed it takes 36 tons. 
  To be sure, Polish warships did take part this year in joint 
maneuvers with NATO units and in several of their own exercises, 
such as "Reda" and "Rekin," but this does not change the fact 
that the number of training cruises was cut back considerably. A 
sailor can gain skills through "dry-fire" training on 
shore-based simulators, but knitting a crew into a unified team 
can be done only over the course of long hours at sea. It should 
therefore come as no surprise that achieving combat readiness 
now takes not just hours but also dozens of hours, and units 
that are sent out after the unidentified submarines that appear 
from time to time in Polish waters return empty-handed.
