<F P=106> [Article by Marek Misiak: "Popiwek 1994, a Difficult </F>
Leave-Taking"] 
  [Text] The principal flaw of the popiwek [tax on wage 
raises] as a means of price controls is that it discriminates 
financially and economically against those it affects. 
Enterprises are deprived of funds, which are not refunded to 
them, and their earnings are lower than at enterprises that, in 
a similar situation, do not have to pay the popiwek. Moreover, 
as is being pointed out, the popiwek is a disincentive for 
higher labor productivity. 
  Years of routine application of the popiwek have resulted in 
generating additional problems. Many enterprises have ceased to 
pay this tax, while others pay it only irregularly. Postponing 
the payment of this tax by juggling books is a widespread 
practice. According to reports from the Internal Revenue Service 
on 10 December 1993, enterprises owed the [state] budget 17.9 
trillion zlotys [Z], of which deferred arrears accounted for 
Z10.3 trillion; arrears for previous years account for more than 
half of the tax indebtedness of enterprises. 
  The arguments made in favor of retaining the popiwek are as 
follows: 
  --The absence of an authentic owner in the state sector 
means 
a potential wage explosion. 
  --The popiwek impedes a decrease in employment--that is, it 
protects against an excessive growth of unemployment. 
  --The popiwek is indispensable to maintaining stability 
because it serves to restrict wage increases to a relatively 
moderate pace; this is particularly important to adhering to the 
principle of indexing the salaries of civil servants and 
pensioners as well as welfare payments to wages paid in the 
economy as a whole. 
  These arguments were sharply contested in the Sejm in recent 
weeks as well as within the governing coalition itself (the OPZZ 
[postcommunist National Trade Union Alliance] was opposed to the 
popiwek). Still, the popiwek was extended until the end of 
March, and the government pledged itself to think up some 
substitute therefor, and it did so.... Last week, the Economic 
Committee of the Council of Ministers approved the draft of a 
new law, "Wage and Salary Guidelines at Economic Entities" (at 
state enterprises and companies in which the State Treasury owns 
a share of at least 50 percent). Following its consideration by 
the Council of Ministers, this draft law may soon now be on the 
agenda of the Sejm. 
  There are no miracles. The draft law is reworking the 
traditional popiwek. This is its principal flaw as seen by many 
deputies. Of course, that is a subject that could be discussed, 
and I am not sure whether the draft would fare better if the 
issues concerned were to be plainly posed in advance. 
  If we overlook certain embellishments and revisions (some 
being debatable) in the language of the proposed solutions, they 
basically seem simply new versions of the popiwek: 
  --One modification is that enterprises are to be fined by 
having to pay a tax amounting to double the wage increase in 
excess of the norm, rather than a progressive tax as in the 
traditional popiwek, which should be satisfactory to some. 
  --One useful revision seems to be that one-half of the 
receipts from popiwek-bis is to be transferred to the Industrial 
Development Agency for spending on industrial restructuring. 
This will alleviate the discriminatory aspect of that tax. 
  --On the other hand, the replacement of the traditional norm 
[wage norm, which if exceeded results in having to pay the 
popiwek], derived from the average wage paid in September 1989, 
with the average wage paid in the second half of 1993 or in the 
entire year 1993, is a highly debatable revision. It would hurt 
the enterprises that, owing to lack of funds or an excessive 
emphasis on solidity, maintained their wages at below the 
norm--and such enterprises account for about 40 percent of the 
total. At the same time, it would benefit those enterprises that 
granted wage increases and that often owe huge tax arrears 
because they hope for continued extensions and ultimately for a 
moratorium on their taxes.... Perhaps a less discriminatory 
solution would be a specific increase in the norm. 
  Of course, other revisions paving the way to a more 
consistent parting with the popiwek also could be indicated. For 
example, agreements for remuneration between the parent agency 
and the administrator--that is, so-called management 
contracts--could be made possible. Unfortunately, however, at 
most enterprises the appropriate organizational and legal 
conditions for this approach are lacking. This would require a 
far-reaching alteration of the methods for exercising the 
function of the owner, a function exercised by the parent 
agencies, including the application of commercial law [to state 
enterprises], which would enable the owner [i.e., the State 
Treasury] to guide more effectively the operations of the 
actually commercialized state enterprises, etc. 
  Particular questions and problems are raised by: a) the 
possibility of choosing an accord with the Internal Revenue 
Service, and b) the possibility of adjustment of wages as a 
function of actual profits. In the former case, this means an 
added burden on the already tightly stretched operations of the 
Internal Revenue Service and, in the latter, a so-called growth 
formula, with its attendant problems, such as a deterioration in 
the situation of the enterprises at which the share of wages in 
operating expenses (in relation to profits) is higher. 
  Moreover, the draft law contains a clause depriving many 
enterprises of the possibility of choosing a wage-control 
approach other than the popiwek--namely, the requirement that 
they must first settle their arrears to the state budget. For an 
overwhelming majority of the debtor enterprises, this 
requirement is impossible to fulfill. 
  Thus, in the near future, we can expect another round of 
government-parliamentary disputes concerning the popiwek. ZYCIE 
GOSPODARCZE has asked members of the Club of 500 [500 leading 
Polish enterprises] for specific comments about this draft law 
of the Ministry of Finance. It can hardly be denied that, given 
its present situation, the Polish economy would find it 
difficult to dispense with the popiwek prosthesis. But, in the 
long run, this prosthesis will not substitute for advanced 
institutional and market solutions, such as, especially, would 
afford real possibilities for so-called trilateral wage 
agreements among employers, employees, and the government. This 
is not just a question of the number of privatized enterprises 
but, to an ever-increasing degree, a matter of bringing order 
into the activities of the state as an owner [of state 
enterprises], genuinely commercializing state enterprises, etc.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Patrik Kovac: "Czech Specter Haunts </F>
Slovak Army"] 
  [Text] In this article, I would like to offer readers an 
"inside" look at the so-called Czech problem in the Slovak Army 
(by someone who is directly involved); I would like to share 
with the readers my observations from within the barracks walls. 
I believe that the barracks where I reported for military 
service in October 1993 following my college graduation are not 
basically different from other barracks in Slovakia, and that I 
can in good conscience consider them to be a true picture of 
barracks in the entire Slovak Republic (with some smaller or 
bigger differences), and I therefore think that my observations 
can be in a certain sense generalized. But to start at the 
beginning. 
  Already upon hearing the first words of the welcoming speech 
by the commander of the school for reserve officers (which, by 
the way, consists of only one training battalion in the whole 
barracks), I was very surprised because I thought that the 
commander must have made a mistake, that his was a slip of the 
tongue. For he introduced the barracks as the "Barracks of the 
Xth Czechoslovak(!) Brigade" (I am not mentioning the exact 
number for understandable reasons). But I was shocked a few days 
later when I was able to leave the barracks and see on the 
outside the actual official name, which, although rather 
inconspicuous, was nevertheless clearly and unambiguously marked 
on the nameplate by the gate--and so, to my unpleasant surprise, 
I found that they really are named "Barracks of the Xth 
Czechoslovak Brigade." And this in the ninth month of the 
existence of the independent Slovak Republic! (And these 
barracks still bear that name.) I found that absolutely 
unbelievable! But inside the barrack walls, many more surprises 
awaited me.... 
  As far as the officer instructors and the entire officer 
corps of the barracks are concerned, I dare say that Czech or 
"Czech-speaking" officers (since quite a few consider themselves 
"Moravians") make up a good fifth of them. Many of them (I do 
not claim that all--I also met one or two decent Czechs) behave 
in a very arrogant manner; their behavior does not indicate any 
gratitude toward the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Army for 
keeping them in its ranks, by which it showed the highest degree 
of tolerance. On the contrary, they often behave in a superior 
and haughty manner, as if they "owned the world." We have 
here, for example, the case of a lower-ranking Czech officer who 
finds it "difficult" to announce himself with the Slovak 
Tu [here] and always uses downright provocatively the 
Czech Zde, although it would not really give him too 
much trouble to learn this simple Slovak word (many others do 
the same thing). Can it be that they do not think the Slovak 
language is equal to the Czech language? That they consider 
Slovak to be something inferior? I know only one Czech in the 
entire barracks who makes an effort to speak in Slovak (and he 
claims to be a Moravian or a Slovak born in Moravia). Others 
stubbornly cling to Czech; they conduct lessons in Czech, 
dictate notes in Czech, give commands in Czech. (I am not even 
mentioning the problems this causes.) At the same time, we know 
that a Slovak officer in the Czech Republic soon talks in 
Czech--there, in the almost chauvinistic Czech environment, he 
would not get very far with his Slovak. 
  From various indications and frequent comments, I know that 
these Czechs who serve in the Slovak Army greatly miss the 
former federation; although, of course, they do not speak out 
openly against the Slovak Republic, and I never actually heard 
them say anything against the Slovak Republic and in favor of 
the CSFR. They are certainly very well aware that it would cost 
them their jobs. But if push comes to shove, who knows? Who 
could say with certainty what their reaction would be? Or who 
could guarantee which side they would join? 
  As far as printed material is concerned, you will not find 
any in Slovak! Practically all of the printed matter I came 
across, from the draft orders to the military identity card to 
instructions on using and operating military equipment, is in 
Czech--and this a year after the independent Slovak state came 
into existence. Graphic diagrams, instructional descriptions of 
weapons and technology on posters and charts--apart from a few 
Slovak ones (which they made here as a do-it-yourself, amateur 
project)--everything in Czech, everything in Czech! And even 
those makeshift charts and posters with instructions are 
written, as I and my friend who is a Slovak-language expert 
agreed, in unbelievably bad Slovak. It is merely a kind of 
literal translation from Czech, with Czechisms or actual Czech 
words with Slovak endings--and I am not even mentioning the 
grammatical errors. Everyone for whom the Slovak language is 
more than just a means of communication (and maybe even to them) 
must throw up their hands over such a creation (a downright 
defilement of our native language). But that is not all. Even 
instructional videos and other films on using weapons or 
repairing military equipment--all are Czech and in Czech! Not a 
single one with a text narrated in Slovak exists! But that then 
causes big problems--for instance, in translating very 
specialized military terms from Czech into Slovak; many 
instructors "capitulate" when searching for a Slovak equivalent 
(after all, "we all know what it means;" or it happens to be 
simpler and more comfortable) and merrily go on using the Czech 
terms! Indeed, even now, after a year of the independent Slovak 
Republic, we can form a good picture of the conditions that 
existed in the Army during CSFR and CSSR (in fact, even during 
the pre-Munich CSR)--before 1 January 1992. The Army was one of 
the efficient instruments for the Czechization of the Slovaks. 
  A very good and graphic--even though sad--example is 
presented by the Slovak officers themselves in the military 
garrisons. There are practically no officers who do not use in 
their oral instructions Czechisms or actual Czech expressions 
(one even gives his commands in Czech--could it be that they 
seem more "forceful" to him?), and, in fact, all of them have 
some smaller, some bigger problems with the Slovak language. 
There are even enough of those whose Slovak is downright 
catastrophic in this respect. No wonder--after all, many of them 
studied in military colleges in the Czech lands, they were 
taught by Czech professors in Slovakia, or they learned from 
Czech textbooks. Until 1 January 1993, Slovaks used to go the 
Czech lands, and Czechs (in lesser numbers) to Slovakia; but 
those who adapted were always the Slovaks. 
  Another shock and a great surprise awaited me when I visited 
our military library. What can you expect? Everything was in 
Czech! The entire index and catalogue of books in the library 
(which one would expect to have been made by a Slovak in 
Slovakia; does this not apply even here?)--in Czech! And to this 
day slogans and quotations from famous people are written in 
Czech on wall posters. Does nobody mind? The library "naturally" 
also has shelves marked with the letter "R" accented with the 
diacritic "hacek" [which exists in the Czech language but not in 
Slovak], something I never saw (not during the time of the 
federation or CSSR) anywhere in Slovakia in civilian libraries! 
Another "matter-of-course" is the great number of Czech books 
(is there an analogous situation in Czech libraries?!--permit me 
to express great doubts about that). It even appears (I did not 
count them exactly) that here--in Slovakia!--there are more 
Czech books than Slovak ones (and we have books beginning with 
fiction all the way to scientific subjects of all kinds). When 
it came to culture and the written word, the Czechs gave it 
particularly careful attention. Even a library was a very useful 
instrument for the Czechization of the Slovak environment. 
  The interior decoration in the barracks and the recreation 
rooms: On the walls hang photographs of the countryside, 
castles, chateaux. Which ones do you think predominate? Slovak? 
Wrong! Again only Czech ones--Czech castles, Czech countryside. 
If Czech, why then not German, British, French?! Don't we have 
enough interesting Slovak subjects? That is also another vestige 
of the legacy of the common--but in fact only Czech--Army. 
  Before I conclude my article, I will mention one more 
example 
to make it clear to the readers how the Czechs acted during the 
division of the federal army, when it was already obvious to 
everyone that the Slovaks would establish their second 
independent state on 1 January 1993. This was told to us with a 
touch of bitterness in his voice by a lieutenant colonel. Before 
coming to teach at the school for reserve officers, he worked in 
a certain Slovak town in a modern tank training facility (for 
training tank drivers and others). Some of the staff and the 
service and repair personnel were Czechs. After the division of 
the federation, these people literally fled to the Czech 
Republic and stole! all of the manuals! Naturally, it was as if 
they had vanished into thin air, and there was no way to find 
out where they were; they simply disappeared. They were gone 
and, with them, all of the complicated, detailed manuals that 
are so essential for making repairs as well as for other 
purposes. Our Czech "brothers" vividly demonstrated their idea 
of brotherhood! Slovak officers and the service personnel then 
had to work nights dismantling and drawing up new wiring 
diagrams and gradually put together a makeshift manual--without 
any help; everything was made much more difficult and 
complicated, especially locating defects and making repairs. In 
spite of that, they managed to somehow keep the trainer in 
operation. It was an unheard of and brazen dirty trick by the 
Czechs, something that is not done among civilized and decent 
people! 
  What to do then? We must literally have a program for a 
planned "de-Czechization" of the Slovak Army. Of course, it is 
complicated as far as the Czech officers are concerned; they 
have Slovak wives, children, apartments.... (On the other hand, 
many Slovak officers are waiting in the Czech Republic because 
there is no housing for them in Slovakia.) However, they could, 
to begin with, learn at least a few expressions (commands) in 
Slovak (many even know them, but it is probably "beneath their 
dignity" to use the Slovak language). We must begin (it should 
have been done a long time ago--a year ago!) with "small steps." 
Also things like a Czech catalogue, Czech rules for borrowing 
books and Czech slogans on library walls a year after the Slovak 
Republic came into existence--those should not be seen any more. 
Czech training films will probably be shown for a long time to 
come--there is no money for making new ones in Slovak--but maybe 
they could be dubbed in Slovak. We must gradually begin (it 
should have been done a long time ago!) changing not only the 
Czech wall-mounted instructions, charts, and posters, but also 
those written in "Czech Slovak" (should at least one Slovak 
language expert be employed in each of the barracks?--he would 
certainly have his hands full!); because this way, with Czech 
professional soldiers and officer instructors, the Czechization 
of the Slovak Army would continue, although at a much slower 
rate--even a year after Slovak independence....

Ruthenians Solemnly Declare After Meeting in Presov] 
  [Text] Rusinska Obroda [RO--Ruthenian Revival] has never 
been and never will be a member of the civic association 
Spoluzitie [Coexistence], its mission is diametrically opposed 
to the strategy and tactics of that movement: This sentiment has 
inspired the proclamation issued by the Coordinating Committee 
of Rusinska Obroda in the Slovak Republic, which met over the 
weekend in Presov. 
  It is the goal of RO to preserve the Ruthenian language and 
culture. This is why its Coordinating Committee demands the 
introduction of a Ruthenian version of the ethnic broadcasts of 
Slovak Radio in Presov and the establishment of a Ruthenian 
language and culture department at the Philosophy College of 
P.J. Safarik University in Presov. The committee also requests 
that [Slovak] media refer to the Ruthenians as a specific ethnic 
group and not confuse them with Ukrainians. 
  As far as the Museum of Ruthenian-Ukrainian Culture in 
Svidnik is concerned, the RO Coordinating Committee in the 
Slovak Republic suggests renaming it the State Museum of 
Ruthenian and Ukrainian Culture and proposes that its director 
be selected by means of an open competition. In addition, it 
advises that the museum should, preferably, also include a 
research department devoted to the documentation of Ruthenian 
culture.

  [Text] Bosnians want their arms! This was confirmed by 
Bosnian Deputy Prime Minister Edip Bukvic and Minister of 
Finance Sead Kresa when they arrived in Ljubljana on 8 February. 
The finance minister was received by Mitja Gaspari [Slovene 
finance minister], Franc Arhar [Central Bank director], and the 
director of the firm Cetis in Celje, which had printed the 
Bosnian currency. However, Deputy Prime Minister Bukvic was 
unable to talk to his counterpart, although he came to Ljubljana 
to resolve the problem of a Bosnian helicopter and the arms 
discovered at the Maribor airport, which are still in Slovene 
possession. Although the Bosnian Embassy tried to contact Prime 
Minister Janez Drnovsek, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lojze 
Peterle, and Davorin Kracun [minister of economic relations and 
development] a week in advance, the Slovene prime minister and 
deputy prime minister could not find the time to talk to the 
Bosnian officials. We have learned that the Bosnians did not 
despair and will continue to seek a consensus with the Slovene 
Government to reach an agreement on the arms waiting at the 
Maribor airport to be transported to Bosnia. The Bosnians 
suspect that, despite their claim to these weapons, the more 
expensive and sophisticated pieces are already missing. Because 
of the arms embargo, the Slovene Government will not be able 
legally to deliver the arms to Bosnia. The Bosnian Government 
would like to work out some kind of a compensation deal with the 
Slovene Government, e.g., in a form of aid to refugees or of 
putting up a satellite for Sarajevo television; after all, the 
arms discovered "accidentally" by the Slovene defense minister 
are valued at about $20 million.

  [Text] Bologna -- Yesterday's talks between Foreign 
Ministers Beniamino Adreatta and Lojze Peterle serve as a 
barometer indicating improved Italian-Slovene relations. Other 
participants in the talks were Luigi Solari, Italian ambassador 
to Ljubljana; Minister Plenipotentiary Pietro Ercole; Marko 
Kosin, Slovene ambassador to Rome; and two department heads in 
the Slovene Foreign Ministry, Stefan Cigoj and Franc Miksa. 
  They discussed the long-term foreign policy of both 
countries 
as a preliminary to Italy's more active support of Slovenia's 
inclusion in the European integration process, especially the 
Partnership for Peace and the European Union. It was also 
necessary to remove Italian suspicions that Slovenia leans too 
closely to central Europe, namely, to the Germanic world. 
Peterle mollified them, emphasizing the priority Slovenia places 
on its relations with Italy. The minority and the property 
claims issues were also on the agenda. It was agreed that a 
protocol on diplomatic and accelerated economic cooperation 
would be prepared shortly.

<F P=106> [Article by Tanja Staric: "First Step Toward Actual </F>
Unification Accomplished"] 
  [Text] Ljubljana -- Yesterday, Janez Drnovsek, Igor Bavcar, 
Peter Tancig, and Viktor Zakelj, the presidents of four center 
parties, signed a charter on the intentions and significance of 
the merger of the political center parties. This symbolic act 
demonstrates above all that they are serious about the merger, 
which might substantially alter the balance of power on the 
political stage and will be finalized at five party conventions 
in Bled on 12 March. The charter cites the reasons for the 
formation of the "bloc of center parties," which is of "vital 
importance for political stability -- without which there can be 
no economic progress or social environment in which conflicting 
social, economic, ecological, and political interests can be 
accommodated through a social and political consensus and 
parliamentary adopted solutions rather than through subjugation, 
humiliation, or even destruction of a real or perceived 
political opponent." The new party will be "open to cooperation 
with any political party or group which actively upholds the 
principles of constitutional order in the country, especially 
the protection of human rights, the rights of the disadvantaged 
and ethnic minorities, and the principle of equality for all 
citizens regardless of their nationality, race, religion, and 
sex." 
  In addition to these libertarian principles, the charter 
states that "the new party will cooperate closely with those 
political parties that strive for a secular state, for free 
enterprise -- balanced by the concerns of a modern state with 
respect to social policy and the protection of the environment 
-- and for a revenue system based on the need to gradually 
reduce the rate of public expenditures to a level comparable 
with that of the Western European countries." 
  The new party will be called the LDS (Liberal and Democratic 
Party, or Liberal Democracy of Slovenia). Its president will be 
Janez Drnovsek. No other positions in the new party have been 
filled. However, the parties' shares in the leadership have been 
agreed upon. The positions in the Executive Committee will be 
divided on a one-to-one basis. If it is comprised of 14 members, 
it would mean that there would be seven Liberal Democrats and 
seven members of "the small troika." The membership of the 
Council will be based on the results of the last election, in 
which the LDS got 22 deputies, Democrats and Eco-Greens together 
10 deputies. In the Statutory and Supervisory Committee the 
Liberal Democrats would have two candidates, and the Democrats, 
Eco-Greens, and Socialists one each. The negotiators have worked 
on these complicated mathematical formulas for months. The 
sensitive issue of which individuals are to hold certain leading 
positions remains open. It seems that there will be four vice 
presidents: Dimitrij Rupel, Peter Tancig, Borut Suklje, and Vika 
Potocnik. The party will have 32 seats in the Parliament, 
compared to the SKD [Slovene Christian Democrats], the second 
largest party, which has only 15 deputies. The unification does 
not change the government coalition, as emphasized yesterday by 
Prime Minister Drnovsek and all three presidents of the "small 
coalition."

<F P=106> [Article by Bozena Kriznik: "Flirting With the Old Markets"] </F>
  [Text] In practice, very little is left of the not so very 
old idea of free trade zones with the former Yugoslav republics 
and of closer economic cooperation with them. Economic relations 
between countries are a reflection of political ones, and depend 
primarily upon the general situation in an individual country. 
And what can Slovenia expect in the near future? 
  Let us take the former Yugoslav economic community as our 
starting point for such reflections. We obviously cannot erase 
the fact that mutual ties, including commercial ones, were 
tightly knit, and that Slovenia, for instance, sold almost a 
third of its goods to other republics, although perhaps at this 
time it is politically more expedient and generally popular to 
try to prove that nothing ties us to the south. 
  To be sure, there is no clear picture of trade among the new 
states, because the pertinent services only started to monitor 
exports and imports in terms of individual states by means of 
customs declarations last year, but we can see a lot of 
"tectonic shifts." The share of the former Yugoslav states in 
the structure of Slovene foreign trade has shrunk drastically in 
the years since independence. Trade has declined by more than 80 
percent (which is 28 percent of total trade). As economist Dr. 
Franjo Stiblar notes in an analysis of Croatian-Slovene economic 
relations, trade with Croatia also declined, although admittedly 
somewhat less. Before Yugoslavia's collapse, Croatia was 
Slovenia's number one economic partner. The data indicate that 
the total volume of trade has fallen from about $8.2 billion in 
1990 to less than $1.5 billion last year. Last year, Croatia 
thus did not even reach 11 percent of Slovenia's foreign trade. 
(Now both of them, Slovenia and Croatia, are each other's third 
partners, after Germany and Italy.) Trade is unbalanced, and 
Slovenia has a considerable surplus. In spite of this, Stiblar 
thinks, Croatia remains an important and interesting trading 
partner for us. "That is why, in view of the development of 
political relations, and just because of pragmatic economic 
interests, it is to be hoped that Croatia will succeed in 
stabilizing its economy, since that would also have a favorable 
effect upon reviving Slovenia's." 
  It actually seems surprising to Josip Skobermet, vice 
president of the GZS [Slovene Chamber of Commerce], that in such 
uncertain and changeable political conditions, in spite of all 
the tension and obstacles, trade with Croatia is still as high 
as it is. The enterprises that had serious economic interests 
have obviously coped and bypassed the obstacles in various ways. 
  Dr. Tone Hrastelj, in the role of a practician and economic 
expert, a specialist on foreign trade, also has a similar 
opinion. In his opinion, political disagreements are the biggest 
obstacle in doing business with Croatia. Since we did not reach 
an agreement on a free trade zone, and since Croatia is treating 
Slovenia like every other foreign country and imposing customs 
duties, there is not enough interest in trade, and that harms 
both economies. In Hrastelj's opinion, Croatia is a more 
interesting trading partner for us than Serbia. That is why it 
would seriously be useful to institutionalize free trade with 
our immediate neighbor, whereas there would only be a 
theoretical possibility of that with the Serbs to start with 
(although, he admits, the Serbian economy is somewhat more 
complementary to Slovenia's than the Croatian economy). "In 
Serbia, Slovenia will probably be under the same foreign trade 
regime as West European countries, but I believe that trade will 
proceed in spite of everything. In comparison with Western 
competition, we will have certain advantages: private 
acquaintances, old commercial ties, knowledge of the language, 
the Serbian deficit in knowledge of foreign languages, Serbia's 
remoteness and foreigners' fears in connection with traveling to 
the southern Balkans...." 
  Last year trade with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia --FYROM], in contrast to other countries, was more 
successful than the year before. The two countries signed an 
agreement on economic cooperation, payment transactions, 
clearing trade based on commodity lists (that agreement from 
1992 did not go into effect), and they have also established a 
joint Slovene-Macedonian chamber of commerce. Slovenia only has 
a real free trade zone with Macedonia. Trade, however, is still 
associated with several difficulties, among which the 
Macedonians are primarily emphasizing the high deficit on their 
side, and problematic payment transactions, while on the other 
hand Slovenia does not see enough products of interest to itself 
in Macedonia. In spite of that, last year's results (about $300 
million in trade) are favorable in comparison with 1992, and 
expectations are still optimistic, but it will probably never be 
possible again to achieve the record trade in the amount of more 
than $1 billion in 1990. 
  Slovenia had already started to negotiate with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on economic relations on a new basis, but in 
the meantime the war in Bosnia came. Trade with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, converted to dollars, has declined abruptly 
from independence onward: from about $250 million in 1990 to 
about $29 million in the first 11 months of last year. One 
cannot expect anything else in the future either in a war 
situation. No one knows how much longer the war can drag on. 
When it is over, devastated Bosnia-Herzegovina will have to be 
rebuilt. The country's rebuilding will probably rely on 
international aid. Slovenia, whose advantages will be--if 
nothing else--geographic proximity and familiarity with the 
market and language--will certainly also apply for some of the 
work. The main limitation, however, will be the established 
practice of investors, who in such cases prefer to employ their 
own economic capacities. 
  Future cooperation with Serbia and Montenegro, in 
particular, 
is arousing polemics. At the moment the issue is still not too 
urgent, as the UN Security Council embargo is still in effect 
for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. As Slovene state 
authorities, the chamber of commerce, and enterprise directors 
assert, Slovenia is observing the embargo. It only trades in 
products for which the UN Security Council's sanctions 
commission issues a special permit, namely medicines and goods 
for humanitarian purposes. Thus, Slovenia's trade with the FRY 
(including miscellaneous items) during the first 11 months of 
last year reached $7 million in exports and $0.3 million in 
imports. Ljubljana's Lek, for example, is exporting several 
medicines to Serbia, with a permit. This is not a continuous 
business, Lek's director Metod Dragonja says, and it depends on 
Serbia's (modest) ability to pay. In terms of volume, it is only 
about a tenth of deliveries three years ago. Medicines actually 
"sell themselves," and no particular commercial activity is 
needed, but Lek also does not have any privileges in comparison 
with foreign competition. At least a minimal presence in the 
Serbian market, however, is especially useful for the enterprise 
in the long term, "so that later, with more optimistic 
developments, it can improve its position in that market." 
  In spite of that, there are many suspicions about violation 
of the embargo. On the shelves of Serbian shops one can find 
products from well-known Slovene producers, and sometimes 
Belgrade television even shows them, claiming that trade (even 
with Slovenes) is proceeding in spite of the sanctions. In some 
people's opinion, the Slovene surplus in trade with Macedonia is 
also ending up in Serbia. Josip Skoberne rejects such hints. 
"Slovenia does not border directly on Serbia. Consequently, they 
should not ask us how Slovene goods have ended up in Serbia; 
instead, they should ask our neighbors first--the Greeks, 
Romanians, Hungarians, Bulgarians, and also the Croats and 
Macedonians. Our data on exports to Serbia's neighbors also 
indicate that exports, with the exception of Macedonia, are not 
growing, and instead have decreased. And if Slovene products are 
ending up in Serbian shops, the producer does not necessarily 
even know about it; it can be due to the middlemen, dealers." 
Finally, the Croats and Serbs are also trading actively with 
each other, not to mention the Greeks, who are the craftiest 
merchants in the world and Serbia's allies. 
  Joze Drofenik, head of the republic coordinating group for 
implementing sanctions against the FRY, confirms that Slovene 
violations of the embargo are rare. The Security Council takes 
care of oversight at Serbian border crossings, and Slovenia 
controls its own borders. If a Slovene enterprise turns up among 
the suspected violators, the proper authorities receive 
information about it, and the suspects, if the violation of the 
sanctions is proven (there are difficulties in proving it, to be 
sure), also pay monetary fines, and the goods are confiscated. 
  Any consideration of future economic relations with Serbia 
and Montenegro, or the FRY, just as in connection with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, starts with a condition: if (when) the 
Security Council sanctions are lifted, when the war is over, and 
when transportation routes are opened... The resounding 
declaration that the FRY and Croatia recently signed, to be 
sure, does not bring any sort of guarantees that relations 
between the signatories will really be normalized. If it does 
contribute to opening transportation routes to Eastern Europe, 
that will be of great significance for the Slovene economy as 
well, Skoberne thinks. 
  The Chamber and the economy particularly favor the idea of a 
free trade zone, and forms of trade with mutually accorded 
privileges (in all former Yugoslav republics). There will not be 
free trade, for which an agreement obviously has to be reached 
at the state level, if politics prevails over sound peasant 
intelligence, they think. "Free trade means benefits for both 
partners, especially with respect to third parties, developed 
ones. Finally, we already have experience with free trade in the 
former Yugoslavia." State institutions, as far as the FRY is 
concerned, are somewhat more restrained, saying that regulation 
of mutual relations at the institutional level is a matter for 
both sides, for coordination of interests, for negotiations. 
  Vojka Ravbar, secretary in the Ministry of Economic 
Relations 
and Development, says: "It is hard for me to say how we will 
negotiate with Serbia. When political relations are normalized, 
after a UN resolution, we will try to establish normal economic 
relations. Time, and also Serbian interests, will show whether 
it will be a free trade area, and at how high a level relations 
will be. Specifically, it is usually harder for the weaker 
partner to decide on liberalization, since it has to protect its 
own economy against outside competition. There are usually 
transitional periods for it, and agreements are a result of hard 
negotiations. We therefore expect a gradual normalization of 
economic relations, to which the former commercial ties, 
knowledge, and experience in that market will contribute." 
  The former republics' share in total Slovene sales will 
never 
be 30 percent again. There is no reason, however, for it to 
remain at last year's 6 percent. It can increase substantially; 
about 20 percent would be a logical, realistic level, naturally 
under normal conditions, Josip Skoberne of the GZS thinks. When 
the war and the embargo are over, trade in spare parts can begin 
very quickly. There are a multitude of products, technical 
items, capital equipment, machines and devices, in the former 
Yugoslavia that are associated with a brand and a producer. It 
will all need to be serviced and rebuilt. Since there will be 
difficulties in payment, the enterprises that have experience in 
supplying the southern markets are already thinking about what 
goods they will buy in exchange for what is exported; they will 
conclude barter arrangements. And if, or rather where, there are 
free trade zones, the partners will trade in products which that 
market is already accepting, but which are noncompetitive in 
demanding Western markets.

<F P=106> [Article by Jelka Zupancic: "Budget: 402.7 Billion Tolars"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Yesterday the Slovene Government adopted the 
1994 state budget, which will amount to 402.735 billion tolars. 
Finance Minister Mitja Gaspari said at the news conference that, 
in the 1994 fiscal year, revenues would amount to 24 percent of 
the GDP while expenditures would be a little higher -- 24.5 
percent of the GDP. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  How Big Is the Deficit? </H5>
  How high is this year's budget deficit expected to be? The 
government proposes 8.9 billion tolars; 50 percent less than 
stated in the budget memorandum, or 0.5 percent of the GDP. This 
year's net borrowing would be even lower -- 7.5 billion tolars. 
The total budget deficit would amount to 30.8 billion tolars; 
internal debts would be 5.5 billion tolars and external debts 
close to 25 billion tolars. 
  How much revenue are to be derived from taxes? About 373.9 
billion tolars or 22.7 percent of the GDP; 12 billion tolars 
more than proposed in the memorandum. Other sources of revenue 
would contribute nearly 20 billion tolars. 
<H3>  More Funds for 
Investment </H3>
  How will these funds be spent? Salaries, material or other 
expenses, defense, social services, payments to contractors, 
subsidies, interest payments, state guarantees for loans, and 
direct state financing would cost 348.4 billion tolars; 4 
billion tolars less than proposed in the memorandum. Investments 
would amount to 42.9 billion tolars; 8 billion tolars more than 
planned in the memorandum. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  Allocations to Ministries </H5>
  Gaspari also wanted to put to rest, as he said, the 
"fashionable debate" on which ministry got the most and which 
the least funds. He pointed out that the administration did not 
interfere with proposals sent from the Presidency of the 
Republic, the Constitutional Court, and Parliament because this 
is not in its jurisdiction. The amounts also do not reflect the 
mission of the ministries. The ministries have received the 
following allocations:

<F P=106> [Article by Ilja Popit: "Unemployment Rate in Slovenia </F>
Declines"] 
  [Excerpt] Ljubljana, 16 February -- In January 1994 
unemployment in Slovenia decreased despite a jump in 
unemployment last December. This is a good start toward 
fulfilling this year's economic forecast, which set unemployment 
reduction as its priority. However, it must be noted that even 
in January the number of unemployed rose in 15 communities, 
particularly in Gornja Radgona and Murska Sobota, while in 
Maribor, which has a disproportionately high unemployment rate, 
only 14 people found jobs. 
  At the end of January 135,323 unemployed were registered at 
the Republic Employment Office; 1.3 percent, or 1,819, fewer 
than at the end of 1993. To compare: in December alone the 
number of unemployed increased by 1,091. However, compared to 
January 1993, the number of unemployed increased 12.7 percent, 
or 15,261. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Zmejkovski, general secretary for the </F>
Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party 
for Macedonian National Unity, by an unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given: "End of the Mystery!"] 
  [Text] We did not react until now in Ohrid, because changes 
are not made overnight; the authorized representative's seal is 
the valid one; those who say that they will clear up the 
situation completely have the wrong orientation; the incident 
with the Bulgarian leaflets is clear, and therefore it is 
incomprehensible why some of our members are being accused of it. 
  The current split in the Ohrid municipal committee of the 
VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity] is 
the reason for our conversation with the party's general 
secretary, Boris Zmejkovski. As we reported in the last two 
issues, there are two parallel party leaderships in Ohrid, with 
both of them claiming that they are legitimate. As they say, 
they are using the same offices, but they are using two 
different seals. The consequences of this situation are quarrels 
among the membership but also uncertainty among Ohrid residents, 
caused by the break-ins at the party offices, the threats, the 
rumors about corruption, and even the rumors about preparations 
for an assassination attempt against the party's leaders. 
  [VECER] Why hasn't the party leadership reacted yet to this 
situation, which has been going on for several months? 
  [Zmejkovski] First, I would like to say that it is right 
that 
the quarrels in our party are being published in the news media, 
in contrast to the conflicts in other parties, about which 
people keep silent. We are likewise grateful, however, that you 
contacted the party's leadership, since I hope that this will be 
the beginning of the end of this kind of mystery about what is 
happening now in Ohrid. 
  It has to do with the inappropriate and undisciplined 
behavior of certain members--instigators and street 
brawlers--some of whom even dared to confiscate food products in 
the name of the party, such as Tane Markovski. Those members 
were expelled from the VMRO-DPMNE. According to the statute, the 
party's general secretary is authorized, in the event of 
internal disagreements or passivity, to conduct dismissals and 
appointments in the municipal committees until conditions are 
created for the election of a new president. Milco Spirovski, 
who is authorized by the VMRO-DPMNE, is legitimate for our party 
in Ohrid. 
  We did not react until now because we are examining the 
incidents; we also have statements by citizens of Ohrid. Changes 
cannot be made overnight. Second, it is not usual to make 
public announcements immediately about internal party conflicts. 
  [VECER] So it is not true that you deliberately did not 
react 
to let the stronger faction win? 
  [Zmejkovski] We never choose between the stronger and the 
weaker faction in any case. Certainly it is least of all in our 
interest to have schisms in municipal committees. The main thing 
is for the program to be respected. If that is not done, anyone 
can be expelled from the party. 
  [VECER] Since there are two party seals in Ohrid, can you 
explain which one is valid? 
  [Zmejkovski] The seal of the people who are authorized by 
the 
party is the valid one. Back in September I sent a letter to the 
dismissed president telling him to return the party seal, 
pointing out that he could face party and criminal proceedings. 
He did not even come to turn over the seal, however, so a seal 
that is not valid is being misused. 
  [VECER] What is happening with the party offices, which are 
being used by both camps? 
  [Zmejkovski] The unauthorized ones do not have any right to 
use those offices. Regardless of who bought or rented them, they 
are party offices and as such are part of the party's inventory. 
If anyone leaves the party, he cannot say that the party's 
property is his own personal property; he never had it. 
  [VECER] How do you view the announcements by the 
unauthorized 
faction that it will completely clear up the situation and the 
rumors that an early VMRO-DPMNE congress will be demanded? 
  [Zmejkovski] That is demagogy and ordinary illusions. It is 
the same thing as saying that the UDBA [State Security 
Administration], which created the quarrels in the party, will 
be fully cleared up. 
  I can only say that those people have a very incorrect 
orientation and they are getting carried away. There are no 
malcontents in VMRO-DPMNE. I personally do not have anything 
against those who feel that way forming another party. 
<H5>  The State Security Service [SDB] Phenomenon </H5>
  [VECER] I also asked the question because we are getting the 
impression that there are also serious conflicts in other cities 
where the VMRO-DPMNE was quite stable, for instance Bitola, 
Veles, Kicevo, and Prilep. 
  [Zmejkovski] It is really a phenomenon, perhaps unfamiliar 
to 
someone, but quite familiar to us. It is a consequence of the 
continued operation of the SDB. Naturally, they strike against 
the stronger committees; they do not have any interest in 
striking against the more passive committees. 
  [VECER] How do you explain the fact that the "unauthorized" 
ones are claiming that members of the other faction in Ohrid 
distributed Bulgarian leaflets? 
  [Zmejkovski] I will repeat: The leaflets were distributed in 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
by the Communist Party, headed by its leadership, under the 
auspices of Tito Petkovski. Now that all of this is known, it is 
incomprehensible to me that the "unauthorized ones" are saying 
that the other group did it. The unauthorized ones are no longer 
members of our party and probably joined us for other 
reasons--in this case it is clear that they are working for the 
interests of another party and under its instructions, solely in 
order to destroy the VMRO-DPMNE. 
  [VECER] Are you taking seriously the rumors about 
assassination attempts against the party's leadership? 
  [Zmejkovski] It is a serious matter that we will certainly 
examine seriously. Perhaps it is also a matter of slander, and 
the party will hold accountable those who made those statements. 
I would rather not go into further discussions of this issue, 
however. 
  I would like to say that we will institute proceedings 
regarding the seals, and the police have already been informed 
about the offices. Nevertheless, it should be noted that when 
the VMRO-DPMNE lodges complaints, the police investigations take 
a very long time. 
  [VECER] Don't you suspect that such quarrels within the 
party 
could lead to a decline in the number of members and in the 
party's standing? Specifically, it is being said in Ohrid that 
that is precisely what will happen as a result of the 
recognition of the authorized representatives' legitimacy. 
  [Zmejkovski] I would not agree that the people there will 
contribute to a loss of membership, since every member and voter 
makes decisions independently, and by clearing up the situation 
we can only win new members.

<F P=106> [Article including interviews with the chairmen of </F>
the Party for Democratic Prosperity by Numan Sallaj; place and 
date of interviews not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Sallaj] The split in the Party for Democratic 
Prosperity [PDP] recently reached its culmination. The two 
conflicting currents, instead of holding a united Congress, 
remain separate, so for all practical purposes the PDP is split 
into two parts. The "joint" delegates who were in the Palace of 
Culture for their Congress elected Arben [Arber] Xhaferi as 
chairman while the part of the party which was transferred to 
the Tetovo Commune Committee elected Dr. Xheladin [Djeladin] 
Murati as chairman in a parallel Congress. Immediately after the 
congresses, the two chairmen claimed that they were legitimate, 
on the basis of the fact that they had a sufficient number of 
delegates. We talked with the two chairmen about this 
competition and asked them the same questions. 
  [Sallaj] After its second Congress, which was held ahead of 
schedule, the PDP has been split into two parts: parallel party 
organs and two chairmen have been elected. Which chairman is 
legitimate and why? 
  [Murati] There is no doubt that the first Albanian political 
entity in Macedonia has split. This is a permanent split. The 
status-quo that existed has been eliminated. Points of agreement 
have diverged once and for all. It is a question of legitimacy. 
The early Congress of the PDP, which was attended by the 
majority of those representatives in whom the people placed 
their trust, has the natural right to legitimacy. I am referring 
to the deputies, the members of the Central Assembly and of the 
Central Presidency who have resigned, the PDP ministers in the 
government, where, together with the delegates elected at the 
Congress, they reviewed the overall work and activity of the PDP 
between the two congresses. An activity report was presented 
which objectively expressed the problems and dilemmas, the 
deficiencies and shortcomings, the successes and failures 
through the prism of a clear view of the work and activity of 
the party in the future and the advancement of the status and 
course of full equality. Which chairman is legitimate? This is a 
provocative question. There is one chairman and one Congress. 
The others are only an informal group and a self-proclaimed 
chairman. Time and the future will prove this; now we can only 
be anxious. This will be addressed by others, the membership, 
those who look at the PDP objectively, and not those who view 
the PDP unilaterally, superficially, and with contempt. The PDP 
Congress, of which I am the chairman, does not have careerist 
aims. It does not close the circle of our collective activity; 
it does not desire to place a political protectorate over those 
who think differently. We are carrying on an indigenous party 
policy; we are not directed by others and we are not the puppets 
of others; we are in favor of genuine cooperation with every 
political entity; we respect dialogue and we express the 
aspirations of the people whom we represent. We are open to all 
who struggle for equality, peace, and understanding, for the 
well- being of the Albanian people in Macedonia and their 
state-forming status. This is the truth and our consistent 
commitments are our legitimacy and my personal legitimacy. 
  [Xhaferi] The PDP was not permanently split into two parts 
at 
its early second Congress. The Council of the Congress, which 
was formed on the basis of an agreement of representatives of 
the two councils, which was reached earlier in Tirana, called 
the Congress and it was held where it was decided at the most 
recent meeting of the Council. Therefore, the PDP Congress was 
held at the Palace of Culture. Documents which are normally 
approved at congresses were approved there; the Central Assembly 
was certified and the leadership was elected. Something which 
should have been done much earlier was done; a process which was 
degenerating the political substance of Albanians in Macedonia 
was ended. There was a congress-like atmosphere in the Palace of 
Congresses, with certified delegates, with politically important 
guests, with an agenda and with documents approved in the 
Council. I do not want to comment on the motives and the way in 
which the other Congress, which you call parallel, was held, and 
the political and ethnic results, because I do not want to 
provoke any unnecessary labeling and groupings among the people. 
I think that the police and judicial organs should rule on the 
legitimacy of one current or another. You should not go near the 
wolf in his own lair. 
  [Sallaj] Why did the compromise achieved by the two councils 
in preparation for the Congress fail and, in your opinion, who 
did not keep the agreement and what, do we suppose, has been 
achieved by observing statutory norms? 
  [Murati] The objectives of the agreement were not achieved 
because one of the parties desired, under any circumstances, to 
achieve, as soon as possible, the narrow position of a voting 
body, while the other party -- which was part of the council 
preparing for the Congress -- wanted respect for statutory norms 
and criteria. Unfortunately, the so-called Assembly of Gostivar 
demonstrated that it was too rigid to show its support for the 
PDP Congress which would be in the interest of all its members 
and supporters. 
  The establishment of the Joint Council of the Congress gave 
hope that the work would be over. According to what I know, 
positions were not coordinated and positions were imposed. 
[passage omitted] The lack of a consensus and the lack of 
understanding of the meaning of compromise are two essential 
factors in the failure of the agreement which was to lead to the 
convocation of a congress of unity and that unity was also 
fictitious. The third factor was the failure to observe the 
statutory norms, that is, Article 37 of the Statute stating that 
members of the Central Assembly, the resigning leadership, and 
the supervisory council, the bodies which give legitimacy to the 
Congress, should take part in the Congress. 
  [Xhaferi] After the meetings of the two councils, in Tirana, 
Prishtina, and Tetovo, and after the constructive pressure of 
the people and of the intelligentsia, a constructive climate for 
cooperation, not to say compromise, was created. The Joint 
Council which called and organized the Congress came out of this 
climate. We can say, without going into political evaluations, 
that all the members of the Gostivar steering council were 
present at the last two meetings while the full membership of 
the other council was never present. As a result, there was an 
atmosphere of victory in the spirit of the Gostivar group. Some 
people did not accept this superiority and organized another 
Congress and left the most recent meeting of the Council. 
However, one deputy minister, a commune chairman, and 
representatives of the Debar and Kercovo branches stayed. So 
there was a forum, with the members of the two Councils, to 
approve the documents of the Congress. The program was approved 
without any dissenting votes, in the presence of all, and the 
Statute was approved with 20 affirmative votes and two 
abstentions, after some members left the Council. The public 
will have an opportunity to verify all these documents. 
  [Sallaj] Many people believe that the split is related to 
the 
civil and ethnic vision of the party. Is this accurate or are 
the differences of another nature? 
  [Murati] The PDP is a civil party which is also fighting for 
the achievement of ethnic demands which are continually denied, 
disrespected, and not satisfied. The PDP is committed to work 
for the natural rights of the Albanians and, for this purpose, 
it carried on extraordinary struggles at various levels within 
the party, within republic institutions, and on the 
international level. It was committed to and it offered options 
and mutual guarantees for creating full equality. Therefore, the 
PDP fought, with the greatest sincerity and with persistence, 
for the achievement of its planned aims, first of all, the 
achievement of equal status. So, the friction, the dissension, 
and, finally, the split (which someone imposed and approved) are 
not the result of the civil or ethnic vision but of something 
else, something more basic which I have not yet determined. 
There must be a thorough analysis and certainly the analysts wil 
carry it out. Albanians in Macedonia are quite divided in regard 
to political options and none of the political parties has the 
right to cause any new splits among the Albanians as to who is 
for the civil or ethnic option. This split which somebody likes 
is both damaging and ironic. We have aimed and pledged to obtain 
the right for the Albanians to be a state-forming element in 
Macedonia so as to advance our status. Division into civil or 
ethnic camps only diminishes the power of political activity and 
weakens the political force of our activity. [passage omitted] 
  [Xhaferi] In the old Program and in the new one drawn up the 
members of the two Councils, the PDP is defined as a party of 
the citizens. There is a tendency for one wing to be 
characterized as ethnic and the other as nonethnic. Recently, 
arguments have been increasing in this direction. Now, the 
conflicts are being explained as rear guard attacks on the 
program and not disrespect for the statutory norms because the 
two sides both approved of the program's contents. If there had 
not been this cooperation, the program certainly would have been 
different. [passage omitted] 
  [Sallaj] The two sides claim to be heirs of the PDP. What 
are 
the arguments and could a court solve this mater? 
  [Murati] Yes, we Albanians really like the courts. I would 
like this even less. Nevertheless, since we have become 
accustomed to agreeing that we cannot agree, perhaps the court 
is the essential instrument for resolving conflicts. The 
heritage of the party is its membership, the road taken so far 
by the party from the village of Xhepcishte to all the branches 
in the entire world, the materials which it left everywhere it 
went, the documents which it prepared and sent to institutions 
inside and outside the country. Nevertheless, the heritage is 
irrelevant for me. The important thing for me is the legitimacy, 
legality, and validity of the Congress. The Congress to which I 
belong has these three elements. Therefore, the greatness of the 
Congress verifies the legitimacy of the PDP. We can reach an 
agreement through democratic means of resolving conflicts... 
However, it is necessary to... 
  [Xhaferi] I would not be the one to defend the legitimacy of 
the Congress which was held in the Palace of Culture. The base, 
the membership, delegates, and assembly members who voted will 
make it legitimate. This has nothing to do with the courts, 
since it is an internal party and political issue which has 
other dimensions. Any outside interference would mean the loss 
of the political integrity of the party. It would result in 
delays which would paralyze the work of the party. [passage 
omitted] To offer this satisfaction now, on the eve of the 
census and other important activities, is political 
shortsightedness. Certainly we will refuse the offer of good 
services on the part of the authorities. 
  [Sallaj] On the basis of the reports of the commission for 
the verification of mandates, it appears that both congresses 
were legitimate since they had a sufficient number of delegates. 
But, how do you explain the fact that in the two congresses 
(taken together) there were more delegates that the number 
specified for a "joint" Congress (244)? 
  [Murati] I was satisfied with the fact that 244 delegates 
were called to the Congress but the hall of the House of Culture 
has 700 seats which means that more than 400 more people were 
"delegates" or guests for a specific purpose, with the exception 
of officially-invited guests who were seated in the front row. 
Threfore, our Congress, the legitimate congress which was held 
in the modest hall of the Communal Assembly of Tetovo, and 
without the accompanying solemnities, had the majority of the 
delegates but not the guests. This is the basic difference which 
should be respected. 
  [Xhaferi] Such reports are not my responsibility. They are 
the responsibility of the appropriate commissions. Soon, many 
things will be cleared up, whether I or anyone else like it. The 
phenomena must be perceived with objectivity. 
  [Sallaj] Who "destroyed" the PDP and how do you see the 
future of this party? 
  [Murati] The PDP has not been destroyed. It has been split 
apart which means the formation of a new party. But I do not 
think that this will be beneficial to our ethnic interests. The 
others know this better than we do because they wanted it. Who 
knows why? The following conclusion can be drawn: the people who 
destroyed the PDP are the ones who wanted to prove to Europe and 
to draw its attention to the fact that Albanians are not for 
democracy, they are not for politics, they are not for the 
government and the state, and that they are only terrorists, 
secessionists, irredentists, who are endangering the territorial 
integrity of the state, destabilizing the well-being of the 
people, endangering peace and coexistence. These are dark 
forces, for short-term use, whom the people identify with 
anti-Albanians. Unfortunately, there are such forces and they 
have demonstrated what they are. The Albanians in Macedonia do 
not deserve this. But this should not sadden and demoralize us. 
This enriches the variety of Albanian life and the political 
structure and increases the competition of political opinions. 
This is normal and it will be normal when another party Congress 
confers on it a sign of distinction or a sign of recognition on 
the part of the PDP. This is its future, a movement which will 
provide ways and means of cooperation for the good of the 
membership which it represents -- the Albanian people in 
Macedonia and Albanian policy, in general. [passage omitted] 
  [Xhaferi] The PDP was destroyed earlier. The former chairman 
of the PDP is trying to explain, in retrospect, the atmosphere 
which brought about the collapse. If there had not been certain 
relationships in the leadership and other party structures, no 
one would have been able to destroy the PDP. This is an 
objective finding which no serious person can disregard. Any 
other explanation, especially the one which talks about outside 
interference, only intimidates the public and stifles opinion. 
Fear always obscures reason. All of us, if we do not 
realistically confront the political problems and other problems 
which disturb the Albanians, will be transformed into 
illusionists who produce phantoms and then are frightened by 
them. I must emphasize that the attempts to involve Albania as a 
negative factor in this conflict are very dangerous, especially 
now when the regenerating processes there are near completion.

<F P=106> [Report by S.M. Vankova: "The Successful Ones Will Break the </F>
Ice"] 
  [Text] According to a Privatization Agency announcement, 
the ice will finally be broken a month from now, when the 
privatization of some 20 chosen companies begins in conformity 
with the Law on Transformation of Companies With State Capital. 
This signifies the realization of the so-called pilot program, 
an important and valued agency activity in which the 
transformation of the chosen companies will be conducted and 
managed by its experts. In a number of companies foreign 
technical aid from EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development] will be involved, with the inclusion of 
international experts who will assist in a number of the 
activities for the pilot transformations. 
  Using the positive experiences from pilot privatizations 
carried out in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and 
with guidance from the consultants "Coopers &amp; Lybrand," the 
agency will use the pilot privatization in 20 companies with the 
aim of testing the practical application of the law, and it will 
draw up regulations and rules for a smoother implementation of 
the transformations and simpler solutions to the practical 
problems that arise. The basic intention, as a matter of fact, 
in realizing this complex program, is to serve as a kind of 
school for the companies, which are apparently cautious and 
inhibited in starting this important process. 
<H5>  Successful Companies </H5>
  With the aim of completing the pilot programs as soon as 
possible, that is, to privatize these 20 companies by the 
beginning of the second half of this year, the agency will start 
selecting the more successful companies. Those will primarily 
be companies with positive results, not very dependent on the 
current blockades in the Macedonian economy. Special attention 
will also be paid to keeping, if possible, 50 percent of the 
capital in the hands of the state; the companies should not have 
problems in proving the ownership over the buildings and 
equipment; they will have a defined position on the market, and 
the developing programs will have particular influence on them. 
In making the selection, a special effort will be made to choose 
companies that are more likely to complete the transformation 
successfully, bearing in mind their initial views on the 
appropriate means of transformation. These criteria will be 
tested in questionnaires in which the interested companies will 
have to present a lot of information on all aspects of the 
situation they are in, including those of interest to foreign 
investors and for the protection of the environment. 
  According to the assistant manager of the Privatization 
Agency Olga Mihajlovska Tikvarovska, pilot privatization will be 
carried out in companies that are starting this process for the 
first time, but also in some that began their transformation 
according to the old regulations, in which the Social Accounting 
Control finished its work. Small, medium, and large companies 
will be included, to provide testing for different models of 
transformation as defined by the law. 
<H5>  Foreign Investors </H5>
  The advantages to the companies included in the pilot 
programs, to be announced two weeks from now, are great. They 
will overcome all the difficulties on the way to privatization 
less painfully, with the professional help of the agency and the 
international experts. In some, the agency will enter into a 
partial or full sale to foreign investors. Opportunities for 
foreign capital entry are seen through the cooperation of those 
who provide technical aid, which will help to promote the chosen 
companies to the international economic and investing public. 
It certainly signifies an improvement in their negotiating 
position in discussions with foreign parties interested in 
investing in definite cases of privatization. 
  The procedures throughout the phases of pilot privatization 
will be continuously elaborated and presented to the public, 
thus making the dilemmas and problems clarified in the 
application of the legal solutions accessible to all companies 
planning to start transformation. How much the pilot 
privatizations will contribute to breaking the apparent 
reputation among companies about this fatal process will be seen 
only after the "landing of the pilots." Moreover, there are 
problems that are much more complicated and not easily solved 
that the companies will in the end have to face themselves.

<F P=106> [Article by Tale Sotirovski: "Modest Consumption Is a </F>
Virtue!"] 
  [Text] Bearing in mind the financial indicators and 
the size of the state apparatus, unquestionably the Macedonian 
State [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is 
among those who function most efficiently and economically. 
  In administering the state, it is only the most 
necessary jobs that are filled, and they are most strictly 
controlled. 
  The cost of legislative work has increased. 
  The representative missions operate on a subsistence 
level with obsolete equipment. 
  Given the situation in which we find ourselves today, with a 
variety of economic difficulties, increased social tensions, job 
insecurity, declining living standards, and so on, we encounter 
a variety of comments, divided thoughts, and different views. 
One of them that is frequently heard, most likely triggered by 
the latest price increases, is the following: One cannot build 
a new state at no cost. Unquestionably, this is quite true, as 
is the second view, which seemed to be the precise opposite of 
the first: that under the circumstances in which we are creating 
and building an independent and sovereign Macedonian State, 
costs should not matter. Based on our possibilities, we should 
build the state on a firm and stable basis. 
  In all cases, regardless of the various shades of meaning, 
one way or another the two views lead to the same question: 
What kind of state are we developing, be it expensive or 
inexpensive, and at what cost, even though we are dealing with a 
relative concept. 
<H5>  Small Steps </H5>
  The answer to this question, however, is not nor could it be 
simple or, even less so, claim to be accurate. To reach it, 
even if within a certain global framework, we must include a 
large number of parameters and perform a number of mathematical 
computations. However, this does not mean that we could not 
reach some more specific knowledge as to the nature of our state 
and the cost of its functioning. 
  According to Dr. Josif Talevski, secretary to the government 
of the Republic of Macedonia and a specialist in state 
administration, if we are seeking the answer as to how much the 
state is costing us in the financial indicators, which would 
include the state agencies and management and administering 
organizations, according to the projected Republic budget for 
1944 [as published] submitted by the end of last month, we could 
generally say that the total will exceed 48 billion denars. 
This includes all the expenses of all agencies, starting with 
the office of the president of the Republic, the Assembly, the 
government, the ministries, and all the way to the lower-level 
services and agencies. Compared to other countries, the cost is 
low, particularly taking into consideration the average wages of 
state officials, which are public knowledge. As we know, 
furthermore, this year's budget for state authorities and 
organizations has been considerably reduced as compared to last 
year's. Furthermore, according to the Budget Law the recipients 
of the budget in the legislative, executive, and judicial 
branches must use their funds strictly for their specific 
purposes, efficiently and economically. 
  Such an economical approach, however, involves more than 
simply the use and handling of funds. The emphasis is on having 
a less costly but not less efficient state and on having these 
attributes become part of all aspects of the work of state 
agencies and administrations. Incidentally, these bodies are 
less cumbersome than the impression they project. This is 
further confirmed by data: Excluding the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and Defense, they total 1,753 employees. There is 
pressure to increase this number. According to Dr. Talevski, 
increasing the administration is a typical phenomenon inherent 
in and affecting all systems. 
  Dr. Talevski says that an increased administration is 
directly related to increased state and public affairs. We 
cannot claim to have avoided this phenomenon. It should be 
pointed out, however, that in 1993 the number of employees of 
budget-supported state agencies substantially declined for a 
variety of reasons (retirement, attrition, etc.). More 
precisely, it is only the most necessary positions that have 
been filled in accordance with the systematization regulations. 
Again, for this year, according to the budget laws no new 
personnel may be hired unless specific funds have been 
stipulated in the budget for that purpose, based on a resolution 
passed by a special commission to be set up by the government. 
<H5>  Extensive Meetings </H5>
  According to Talevski, in discussing the size of the 
administration we must always bear in mind that it must be 
consistent with the size of the population and must meet the 
needs of the citizens. It would be difficult, he said, to name a 
country that knows precisely the size of the administration its 
needs. Improving and updating the state administration presents 
no problem. 
  "Modernizing the administration is necessary to make it more 
efficient. We are still far from claiming to have a modern 
administration in terms of facilities. The conclusion is that we 
cannot accuse the administration of inefficiency if we do not 
invest in its modernization. It is enough to take a look at our 
local offices and their facilities. Updating them may increase 
the cost of state management, but if we want efficiency the cost 
is inevitable." 
  The legal authorities of the state cannot be ignored in 
determining whether the cost of running the state should be 
higher or lower. In this specific case, more funds would be 
required to ensure the unobstructed work and functioning of the 
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia. Among others, we must 
provide for the salaries of the 137 Assembly officials, the 76 
permanent paid representatives, and the 53 managers and experts, 
and cover other expenses. Such expenses have not declined. As 
of 8 January 1991 [as published], for example, so far 72 
sessions have been held, many of which have been extended. A 
large number of them were initiated and not completed. 
Therefore, adding this all together it turns out that, in 
practical terms, the parliament was in session one day out of 
three. On the other hand, it has been calculated that an average 
session, including the cost of printing, public facilities, 
toilet articles, and per diem and travel expenditures, costs 
about 300,000 denars. Here is another piece of information: The 
cost of the 68th parliamentary session was 34,570 denars for per 
diem expenses; payments to the representatives for the 11 months 
of last year totaled 18.329 milion denars. 
<H5>  Transportation </H5>
  The premises of the representatives of the Macedonian State 
are furnished with obsolete and worn-out equipment, and their 
transportation fleet is very modest. The service in charge of 
general and Assembly work for the Macedonian Government, which 
services all state authorities and organizations, has only two 
small airplanes and about 35 various vehicles, most of them of 
inexpensive models. The fleet is quite obsolete and should be 
updated. However, there are no financial possibilities 
whatsoever to update it. As the service officials have stated, 
they will wait for better times. 
<H5>  Obsolete Facilities </H5>
  Based on the sums we have quoted, it is quite obvious that 
the Macedonian State is not among the rich. Despite the existing 
economic circumstances, it insists that the necessary functions 
be performed with a modest amount of the people' money. However, 
this does not mean that this situation can last forever. With 
the expansion of international and other activities, and the 
opening of diplomatic and other missions within Macedonia and 
Macedonian missions abroad, commitments will increase and so 
will demand for funds. In this connection, another topical issue 
is that of representational facilities. It is a fact that our 
country still has no proper residence in which to house heads of 
state or government or any other high guests. It is true that 
Skopje and Ohrid each have two cottages used to house 
representatives of foreign countries visiting Macedonia. They 
are in such poor condition, however, that we should not even 
list them as representative facilities. They have remained 
virtually unchanged since they were built, with worn-out and 
obsolete amenities, and they have a large number of other 
unsolved problems. In terms of their purpose, they are 
dysfunctional. 
  According to Boris Treneski, who heads the Service for 
General and Assembly Projects of the Macedonian Government, it 
is precisely for such reasons that we must concern ourselves 
with these facilities and bring them up to modern standards. In 
that sense, the government has already passed a resolution on 
renovating the four cottages -- "Makedonija," and "Vodno" in 
Vodno, and "Biljana" and "Ohrid" in Ohrid -- and on refurbishing 
the Representatives Club in Skopje, making it suitable for 
receiving foreign delegations. Furthermore, possibilities will 
be sought to provide proper premises for an international press 
center. Considering the economic situation, this will not be 
easy. However, we have no choice.

  [Editorial Report] The following information on contagious 
diseases in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] is 
provided by the Skopje dailies, NOVA MAKEDONIJA and VECER: 
<H5>  Hepatitis </H5>
  On 1 February on page 8, VECER reports that the rumors 
circulating in Skopje, to the effect that three coffee shops, 
"Mejk-ap," "Akademija," and "Apolon" [names as transliterated] 
were sources for the outbreak of hepatitis, are unfounded 
according to Dr. Tomislav Popov of the epidemiological section 
of the Institute for Preventative Medicine. According to Dr. 
Popov, only one of the patients has any connection to any coffee 
shop, in this case, the "Mejk-ap" coffee shop, but the 
individual did not actually work there. The article does not 
cite the number of cases in Skopje, but Dr. Ljupco Ivanovski, 
the manager of the hepatitis section at the clinic for 
infectious diseases, claims that "the number of `jaundiced' 
patients who have been hospitalized, and those who are 
recovering at home, is within the limits of the normal level, or 
that which is customary for the season of the year." 
<H5>  Influenza </H5>
  On 2 February on page 9, NOVA MAKEDONIJA reports that the 
first few cases of influenza have been treated at the institute 
for preventative medicine in Skopje and an undisclosed number of 
cases elsewhere in the country. On 11 February on page 9, VECER 
notes that 23 cases of influenza have been reported in Skopje, 
575 in Titov Veles, 479 in Gostivar, 329 in Kicevo, and 159 in 
Prilep. Preliminary serological tests indicate that the patients 
are suffering from Type-A influenza. On 17 February on page 5, 
NOVA MAKEDONIJA reports that the number of registered cases of 
influenza has risen to 2,986. The newspaper cites Dr. Dusko 
Panov, director of the Institute for Epidemiology and 
Microbiology at the Institute for Preventative Medicine: 
"According to the available data, it is possible to say that in 
some opstinas [districts], an epidemic stage has already been 
reached. These opstinas are Titov Veles with 574 cases, Prilep 
with 546, Gostivar with 472, Kratovo with 330, Kumanovo with 
250, Stip with 219, and Kocani with 163." The type of virus has 
not yet been isolated, but specialists think that it is probably 
Type-A influenza. 
<H5>  Tuberculosis </H5>
  On 14 February on page 8, VECER reports that approximately 
1,650 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis have been registered in 
Macedonia. Of these, 630 are new cases. According to official 
statistics, there are 677 cases in Skopje, 218 in Gostivar, 89 
in Kumanovo, and 42 longstanding cases in the Bitola region.

<F P=106> [Article by Uros Komlenovic: "The Lords of Serbian Rulers </F>
Street"] 
  [Text] Veljko Dzakula, former deputy prime minister of the 
Serbian republic Krajina [RSK] and leader of the SDS [Serbian 
Democratic Party] of Western Slavonia, is not the first 
kidnapping victim in Belgrade: Before him a similar fate was 
suffered by Dusan Reljic, VREME editor, and a year before that 
by Jovan Mandic, chief of the research section of 
Elektrodistribucija Beograd [Belgrade Power Company], the man 
who during the St. Vitus Day rally turned off the street lights 
in the vicinity for several moments. (The kidnapping of Sandzak 
villagers and travelers from the train on the Belgrade-Bar 
railroad is a separate chapter in the Balkan history of 
dishonor.) However, by contrast with Reljic and Mandic, who were 
released after lengthy interrogation (Reljic) and even beating 
(Mandic), this time there is some question whether Veljko 
Dzakula is alive. Five days after the kidnapping the information 
service of the RSK MUP [ministry of internal affairs] issued a 
news release stating that "Veljko Dzakula, who is the subject of 
investigatory proceedings before the district court in Glina, 
was again turned over to the competent authorities of the 
Serbian republic Krajina on 4 February." 
<H5>  This Is No Film </H5>
  The kidnapping took place on 4 February at about 1130 hours 
in Belgrade, at the corner of Serbian Rulers and Svetozar 
Markovic. Thus, in the middle of the day and the busiest section 
of the city. Incidentally, similar scenes have been seen many 
times in detective films, but by contrast with the Hollywood 
"professionals," who nimbly stuff the victim into a car and 
vanish, leaving the confused pedestrians wondering whether it 
all really did happen, reality here is quite different and 
proves that in addition to brutality and a disturbing 
self-confidence, Dzakula's kidnappers displayed a clumsiness 
that would give gray hairs to the head of any respectable and 
effective secret service. 
  Judging by the testimony of the numerous eyewitnesses, the 
abduction took a long time and was painful to watch, to say the 
least. As Veljko Dzakula and Dusan Ecimovic, former RSK 
information minister, were walking down Serbian Rulers Street, 
an unknown man accosted them and asked, "How are you, Mr. 
Dzakula?" and with the help of two confederates immediately 
grabbed the victim. Ecimovic, shoved out of the way, ran away as 
a fourth kidnapper said to him, "You don't have to run." 
  Then there was a fight. Three of the abductors tried to 
shove 
Dzakula into a gray Japanese car (the witnesses do not agree on 
whether it was a Toyota or Mazda), with the license plate BG 936 
525, parked in a section of Svetozar Markovic Street that is set 
back a bit, between the fence of a nearby construction site and 
the pedestrian crosswalk. The car's rear right door was open, 
but the former deputy prime minister of the Krajina government 
had no intention of getting in and giving up without resistance. 
In the fight and shoving he lost his glasses, the sleeve of his 
coat was ripped off, and his appeals for help drew the attention 
of a group of passersby who gathered at the crosswalk and 
watched what was happening in disbelief. They were the 
responsibility of the fourth abductor, who produced some kind of 
credentials, representing himself as a policeman and warning 
those gathered not to interfere with his colleagues. One 
eyewitness noted that on the other side of Serbian Rulers Street 
there was a strikingly nervous man holding a walkie-talkie, and 
according to the statements of other witnesses, there were six 
or seven people involved in the entire action. Unusual dialogue 
was also recalled. When one of the gathered citizens asked, "Why 
are you knocking him down?" this was the answer: "Well, you can 
see that he doesn't want to go." 
  Chemistry was called upon as a last resort. The most 
striking 
of the abductors (a very tall and strong young man with 
short-cropped blond hair, wearing a suit, a loud tie, and 
sunglasses) at one point pulled out a spray can (it was probably 
tear gas or something similar) and shot a stream in Dzakula's 
face. It took a great deal of work to get the job done -- 
Dzakula was handcuffed, thrown into the car, and one of the 
attackers gave him a powerful kick with both feet, holding to 
the car roof, presumably to confirm the triumph. The rest of the 
team got in another car, which was red (also Japanese, but no 
one remembered the license plate number), and left the astounded 
citizens to cross themselves in amazement. 
  It is worth pointing out that one of the eyewitnesses met 
four policemen a bit later on the corner of Serbian Rulers and 
Prince Milos and told them the whole story. Only one of them 
wanted to listen to him (the rest went on their way without 
turning around), but in the end he queried: "What can I do about 
it?" and went off. 
<H5>  Town Gossip </H5>
  News about the abduction spread quickly through the city, 
but 
the speediest reaction came from the Citizens Alliance of Serbia 
[GSS], which immediately sent a telegram to Slobodan Milosevic 
and Zoran Sokolovic, minister of internal affairs, informing 
them about the event and demanding Veljko Dzakula's release. A 
Committee to Free Veljko Dzakula and Defend Political Freedoms, 
headed by the Belgrade criminologist Vladan Vasilijevic, was 
immediately formed (this is actually the same organization which 
last June worked to get Danica and Vuk Draskovic freed). Nikola 
Barovic, Borivoje Borovic and Boris Popovic, along with Dragor 
Hiber (GSS)... were hired as attorneys. Depositions were taken 
from witnesses, press releases were issued, information about 
the abduction was made public at a press conference, and even 
DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia] was heard from. The Public 
Security Service of the Serbian MUP [ministry of internal 
affairs] denied any part in the abduction, and a similar 
statement was issued by the RSK MUP. The State Security Service 
[SDB] of Serbia was not heard from, although it is the one 
accused of the abduction. 
  That is, one of the witnesses said that he heard the 
attackers say they were from the Serbian SDB. What is more, 
POLITIKA, alluding to statements from "well-informed sources," 
called attention to an official house next to the Security 
Institute on Banjica, where members of the Serbian SDB are said 
to be holding Veljko Dzakula prisoner. 
  The press release from the RSK MUP we have mentioned was 
last 
to arrive; it was probably supposed to put a stop to the talk 
about the abduction. However, it had the opposite effect. The 
Krajina MUP, that is, says that until recently Dzakula was in 
custody of the competent court, but he had been released from 
pretrial custody on the basis of a guarantee that he would not 
leave the town where he lived (Pakrac). It goes on to say that 
Dzakula is suspected of espionage and threatening territorial 
integrity (it does not say which state's territory is in 
question), but Articles 128 and 116 of the FRY Criminal Code are 
mentioned?! 
  Until recently Dzakula was in fact in pretrial custody: on 
21 
September of last year he was arrested along with Dusan Ecimovic 
and Mladen Kulic. The "first political prisoners of the RSK" 
spent 72 days in prison (the first five days in Knin, and later 
in Glina). They were charged because of the 11-point agreement 
which they signed along with representatives of the Croatian 
side on 18 February in the village Doljani, which is near 
Daruvar. That agreement did not prejudice resolution of the 
Serb-Croat conflict, but was an attempt to settle in some 
fashion certain infrastructural issues (the express highway, 
gas, mutual communication...), which was in any case of the 
greatest interest to the "ordinary" Serbs and Croats in Western 
Slavonia. Experts in international law say that the agreement 
did not have the "weight" of an official intergovernmental act, 
and they are thus contesting the charges of "espionage" and 
"treason." That is why Dzakula, Ecimovic, and Kulic were 
released from pretrial custody, and aside from the statement of 
the RSK MUP made after the fact, there have no suggestions 
whatsoever that their movement was limited. 
<H5>  The Interview </H5>
  It is of interest that all three traveled to Belgrade on 2 
February, two days before the abduction. We have learned that 
Dzakula came to Belgrade to see his wife and child (he had not 
seen them for eight months) and to get food (2000 fryers) and 
seed for planting in order to help the people of Pakrac get 
through the winter somehow. On Thursday 3 February Veljko 
Dzakula was a guest on the program "Viewers' Interview" of 
Independent TV Studio B, where he recalled certain interesting 
and neglected events, which is generally believed to have been 
the reason for the abduction. He was abducted 11 hours after the 
program. 
  In any case Veljko Dzakula's abduction gives rise to a 
number 
of extremely important questions: Who abducted him? Is he alive? 
If he is, then where is he? Does he have the right to a lawyer 
and an honest trial? Does the Krajina MUP have the right to 
carry out such an action on the territory of the FRY? Does the 
Serbian SDB have the right to cooperate in this way with its 
counterparts on the other side of the Drina? Who is in control 
of the Serbian SDB anyway? How long are the citizens of Serbia 
going to put up with the most brutal violations of elementary 
human rights? 
  Answers should be sought from Slobodan Milosevic, Zoran 
Sokolovic, Jovica Stanisic, who heads the Serbian SDB, or Franko 
"Frankie" Simatovic, the operative of the Serbian SDB 
responsible for liaison with the Krajina, who, we have heard, 
was recently promoted to head the operations department of the 
SDB. Perhaps the case of Veljko Dzakula will be the one that 
shows whether Serbia, at least in its pronouncements, is a 
law-governed state, or in future will we all be living even 
officially according to the "law" of Attila the Hun and Al 
Capone?

  [Text] The Committee for the Defense of Political Freedoms 
and the Liberation of Veljko Dzakula (former vice president of 
the self-proclaimed republic of Serbian Krajina kidnapped in 
downtown Belgrade on 4 February, a day after being interviewed 
on independent television station Studio B] held a second news 
conference yesterday in the offices of the Civic Alliance of 
Serbia. It was stated that the committee had reliable 
information that Dzakula had been brought before the district 
court in Glina [republic of Serbian Krajina] only yesterday and 
that criminal proceedings had been instituted against him. 
According to the same information, signs of torture were visible 
on Dzakula, and he had not been provided with medical or legal 
aid. The committee believes that this news should be confirmed 
officially and that the Government of Serbia should explain why 
Dzakula has been deprived of freedom, on whose orders he was 
arrested, and to which ministry in Serbia he was handed over. 
  In the continuation of the news conference, it was stated 
that the committee had also turned to the official bodies and 
institutions of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia, but that there had been no response. Also, it was 
proposed that the case be handed over to the authorities of the 
civilian sector of the United Nations in charge of the republic 
of Serbian Krajina zones. 
  It is important, as regards the Dzakula case, to hear from 
the service that several days ago issued a communique stating 
that Dzakula had been brought to Glina, because, as the 
committee claims, this was not true, since Dzakula was brought 
before the district court in Glina only the day before 
yesterday. The committee believes that there is a pressing need 
to provide legal protection to all citizens at this moment. The 
country has entered a phase of unrestrained terror, it was 
concluded at yesterday's news conference on the Dzakula case.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 20 February edition of the Belgrade 
daily POLITIKA, on page 9, attacks an article that appeared in 
the Podgorica, Montenegro, daily POBJEDA "the day before 
yesterday" calling for the secession of Montenegro from the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. POLITIKA states that the POBJEDA 
article's author, Dragan Hajdukovic, a resident of Switzerland, 
is remembered for his pamphlets, published in Switzerland, 
calling for "the bombing of Belgrade" and requesting the 
"imposition of sanctions against his own country." Now he "makes 
an appearance in the domestic press," and, "at a time of paper 
shortages," publishes on "two entire pages" of POBJEDA a 
political program for the "renewal of the Montenegrin state," 
instructing the Montenegrin people "to secede from Yugoslavia." 
Hajdukovic disregards the fact that the large majority of the 
inhabitants of Montenegro declared themselves in favor of a 
joint state, POLITIKA remarks, adding that the editorial staff 
of POBJEDA has already disassociated itself from the article, 
calling it a "glaring error."

  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  Serbia--a New Regional Military Power </H5>
  So far Serbia and Montenegro have been economically 
exhausted 
and left isolated from the international community. They have 
only achieved successes in the military area. From the 
standpoint of the military achievements during the three years 
of war, we would have to include among the key strategic changes 
in the area of the former Yugoslavia the formation of the 
Serbian parastates west of the Drina River. That process took 
place in parallel with the military strengthening of Serbia and 
Montenegro, which absorbed almost the entire military potential 
of the former federal state. During the year-long convergent 
withdrawal of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] from the west and 
the south, Serbia turned into a regional military power; it 
became the domicile for the withdrawing units, and for almost 
the entire equipment, elements of defense industry, and reserves 
of the former federal state. With the international community's 
embargo on importing weapons into the states that were the 
victims of Serbian aggression, the other states were prevent 
from successfully opposing it. 
  To illustrate the transformation of the federation of Serbia 
and Montenegro into a regional power, we should mention that at 
the beginning of this year, the following military resources 
were on its territory--which encompasses only 102,350 square 
kilometers and is 2.5 times smaller than the former Yugoslavia: 
  --135,000-150,000 troops (the number varies because of 
occasional mobilization and other exercises, for which military 
conscripts are drafted); 
  --1,100 combat tanks (300 M-84's and 800 T-54/55's); 
  --1,170 combat armored personnel carriers; 
  --1,900 self-propelled and towed cannons for infantry 
support 
(105-mm and larger calibers); 
  --187 multiple rocket launchers; 
  --3,000 large-caliber mortars (120 mm); 
  --3,400 medium-caliber mortars (82 mm); 
  --4,100 recoilless cannons; 
  --282 self-propelled antiarmor missile launchers; 
  --1,330 antiarmor cannon (70- to 100-mm calibers); 
  --480 combat aircraft; 
  --136 armed helicopters; 
  --a fleet (five torpedo submarines, four assault submarines, 
four frigates, 12 missile boats, and 12 torpedo boats). 
  It is obvious from the number of weapons that during the 
three years of war the so-called Yugoslavia's army has not 
reduced its weaponry, but instead has increased it even further. 
We could seek the causes only partly in purchases (25 MiG-29's, 
SCUD missiles, new long-range antiaircraft missiles), because 
the main supplier has been its own defense industry. In contrast 
to the rest of industry, which is operating at 20 to 25 percent 
of capacity in Serbia, the defense industry plants are said to 
be operating at three times higher a capacity, with the plants 
that the Serbs evacuated from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia 
already equipped for production last year. They are producing on 
a particularly large scale 120-mm mortars, new types of shells 
(with proximity detonators and a rocket motor), large-caliber 
sniper rifles (12.7 mm), and so forth. 
  If, in addition to the number of soldiers, we also take into 
account the paramilitary units (the party militias, which are 
well-armed with light infantry weapons and well-trained, because 
some of their members are constantly operating in territories 
west of the Drina), then we can ascertain that the so-called 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] has about 205,000-220,000 
people under arms (this figure does not include the 70,000 
policemen, who are also trained for combat missions). If we 
express the density of military strength in terms of the 
quotient of the number of troops and weapons and the state's 
area (in square kilometers), we obtain the following value: two 
soldiers, 0.22 tanks and armored vehicles, 0.0829 cannons, 
rocket launchers, and mortars, and 0.006 aircraft and 
helicopters per square kilometer. 
  For a state that has a per capital national income 10 times 
lower than ours, those quotients are sometimes higher than the 
European bloc averages, namely approximately four times higher 
for the density of troops, almost twice as high for tanks and 
armored vehicles, almost four times for aircraft and 
helicopters, and almost 13 times for artillery. The 
above-mentioned indices--in spite of the obsolescence of the 
aircraft equipment--clearly show what kind of military power the 
so-called Yugoslavia has become, although its leadership 
insistently reiterates that it is not at war, while concealing 
the fact that without its logistical support the western Serbian 
armies would never have conquered what they did. Last year it 
spent approximately 25 to 33 percent of the total GNP to finance 
the war and the Serbs west of the Drina. Paramilitary troops and 
many experts from the western Serbian armies have likewise been 
trained in Serbia. 
  The process of militarization is also apparent in the 
territories west of the Drina; in that zone, the republic of 
Srpska [RS] and the republic of Serbian Krajina have a total of 
about 150,000 people under arms [one-third of them are RSK 
soldiers). If we also take into account the weapons that the 
Serbian soldiers have (about 500 tanks and armored personnel 
carriers, about 600-800 cannons, long-range missiles, and about 
50 aircraft and helicopters), then their military superiority 
(over the Croatian and Muslim units, which otherwise total about 
190,000 fighters with about 100 tanks and 300 cannons, and whose 
main forces are entangled in mutual Croatian-Muslim conflicts) 
explains how the numerically inferior western Serbian arms have 
succeeded to date in conquering 25 percent of the territory of 
Croatia and 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
They have thus created the basis for increasing Serbian 
territory by 50 percent in the event of a merger with the 
so-called FRY. 
  Since the beginning of the war the Croatian army has made 
great qualitative and quantitative progress (it has 150,000 
people under arms and about 600 tanks and armored vehicles, and 
approximately 800 cannons); in spite of this, if it started the 
long-announced decisive, but always postponed offensive (for the 
final liberation of its territories)--if all the Serbian armies 
merged--it could not achieve the superiority needed for a 
successful attack. The Croatian general staff is also aware of 
this, and therefore decided on tactical operations with limited 
goals ("Miljevac plateau," "Maslenica," and "Divoselo"). 
<H5>  The New Serbian Doctrine as a Source of Threats </H5>
  The former JNA's failures in the wars in Slovenia, Croatia, 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina led to the former JNA general staff's 
purge of old personnel, and simultaneous formulation of a new 
doctrine that takes into account experiences from the Gulf War 
(in 1991) and other local wars. They focused their main efforts 
on forming an ethnically pure army. The use of paramilitary 
forces is an "invention" that allowed the general staff to use 
others to carry out the dirty job of "cleansing territories" 
(which essentially involves terrorist operations against 
civilians with the intention of intimidating the non-Serbian 
population into abandoning the territory); they defined 
long-range weapons as urgently needed new weapons. Specifically, 
they needed a "strategic response" in the event that the 
so-called FRY became the target of missile attacks like those 
experienced by Iraq (1991) and Libya (1986). In connection with 
this, they devoted particular attention to the procurement and 
development of long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. 
In this regard we should mention that in addition to the threats 
from the Radical Seselj, back in 1992 then chief of the General 
Staff Zivota Panic also announced the development of a missile 
with a range of 1,000 kilometers; he thereby made it clear that 
the range of the newly acquired SCUD ballistic missiles (450 
kilometers) did not meet the new doctrine's requirements. 
  From the standpoint of the balance of power, as a particular 
threat factor for all of the Balkans and beyond, we should 
mention the new Serbian offensive doctrine; it specifically 
proves that the threats announced during the past year by the 
civilian and military leaders of the western Serbs (for example, 
about the bombardment of refineries, urban centers, nuclear 
power plants, etc.) were not the brandishing of an empty weapon, 
since this year they were actually fulfilled. Even though Gospic 
in September 1993 involved a tactical attack by the Croatian 
army, in which the Croatian units did not occupy more than 150 
square kilometers of the RSK's territory, the Serbs responded 
with a merciless bombardment of numerous Croatian towns (the 
vicinity of Zagreb, Samobor, which lies along the Slovene 
border, Sibenik, Zadar, and Karlovac), and industrial facilities 
(the Sisak refinery, and the Kutina artificial fertilizer 
factory), and they also fired--for the time being only in 
warning--surface-to-surface missiles (specifically, in the 
immediate vicinity of Zagreb). The doctrine of Serbian deep 
strikes against urban centers, accompanied by assaults by 
Serbian special units deep behind enemy lines, indicates that if 
there is a renewed escalation of conflicts, the Serbian armies 
will not limit themselves only to a tactical defense, but will 
instead respond with the already announced strikes against the 
entire depth of the territory within the range of their weapons. 
Consequently, towns still remain the main targets (they are 
treating Vukovar, Osijek, Dubrovnik, and Karlovac as paradigms 
for the future). In this regard, they are seriously counting on 
support by "volunteers" from the so-called Yugoslavia, which 
will only be a camouflage for the use of regular units from the 
so-called FRY. [passage omitted] 
  Taking into account the fact that the chief of the so-called 
FRY's General Staff visited Iraq last year precisely because of 
Iraq's experiences, and that there are many indirect indications 
that the army of the so-called FRY has succeeded--in spite of 
the embargo--in obtaining long-range weapons, last year's 
threats by Serbian generals about attacks against all targets 
within range of their weapons should be taken seriously, and 
appropriate defensive countermeasures should be sought in time, 
or else we would be risking what the surprised victims of the 
Iraqi and Libyan attacks experienced. 
  In connection with this, we should recall that this year's 
list of 30 civilian targets that RSK General Novakovic announced 
"urbi et orbi" to the Croatian public also included Pulj; in 
view of the distribution of Serbian positions, this means that 
in Slovenia, the Serbian weapons could reach targets up to the 
Radovljica-Sezana line. Furthermore, we should recall that in 
neighboring Croatia, just as previously in Italy (in 1986) and 
Israel (1991), before last September's events occurred, they 
were assessed from a professional standpoint as not very likely 
or unlikely, but they nevertheless happened.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Lekovic: "`1 December' Electronics Industry </F>
Enterprise, Pljevlja: New Program Despite Problems"] 
  [Text] The sanctions and economic blockade have 
significantly diminished the usability of facilities for 
manufacturing modern electronic and microwave machines, 
equipment, and systems; enterprise experts have turned to new 
programs--they are producing laser systems and radio-relay 
equipment; after the sanctions are lifted, they will announce 
several new programs for their main customer--the Armed Forces 
of Yugoslavia [VJ], but also for export. 
  When production began in 1985 at the "1 December" 
electronics 
industry enterprise plants in Pljevlja, one of the designated 
facilities of the military industry, no one could have suspected 
that after seven or eight years of full-swing operation and 
prosperity, production would be cut by more than half and only 
one-third of the facilities would be in use. The effect of 
sanctions and the economic blockade has been that the production 
of one part of the equipment at the collective involving 
especially highly trained staff has shut down, while part of 
production has been adapted to the existing possibilities of the 
VJ and of the Yugoslav market. 
  Lately, cooperation has been reduced to electronics industry 
enterprises in the FRY. The fruit of this rapid adaptation and 
of the reaction of experts to secessionism has been the "pilot" 
series of a type of telephone-telegraph device. "1 December" 
will perform the finishing work, and the production of more than 
100 such devices has already been contracted. The Pljevlja 
enterprise will soon begin repairs on several types of weaponry 
and military equipment, especially radar and radar systems, 
electronic countermeasure systems for VJ ships, thermovisual 
systems for MiG-23 warplanes, radar detonators for air-to-air 
missiles, and various radio systems. 
<H5>  Development of Laser Equipment </H5>
  The "1 December" enterprise is concentrating on the 
production of optronic laser systems and radio-relay equipment 
in cooperation with domestic firms. Thus preparations are being 
made for the production of laser rangefinders for tanks. The 
production of laser systems and radio-relay equipment has been 
necessitated by the new demands and needs of the VJ, because 
previously this equipment was manufactured in Slovenia. 
  Nevertheless, there are serious obstacles to be overcome in 
the production process. According to the director of the 
enterprise, engineer Rados Beljkas, the biggest problem is the 
shortage of money and the serious economic situation of the 
Armed Forces of Yugoslavia--the main customer. Acquiring 
intermediate goods from abroad is also creating problems. 
  "All of this has meant that utilization of our facilities is 
at 20 to 30 percent, which is very bad, because we have at our 
disposal the most modern equipment and a highly skilled work 
force, of which any European factory would be proud," director 
Beljkas tells VOJSKA. 
  Of the 186 employees, engineers account for one-fourth. They 
are not all sitting around waiting for the sanctions to be 
lifted. The director says that "1 December" has good prospects, 
and that contention is backed up by the existing and new 
programs for the needs of the VJ. Many countries are also 
interested in this collective's production--Egypt, India, the 
DPRK, Russia--especially its detectors and radars. 
<H5>  Rapid Adaptation </H5>
  Although the enterprise has been forced to send part of its 
workers on mandatory leave, it is quickly coping with and 
adapting to current market needs. Thus facilities are being used 
to manufacture products that are essential to the Pljevlja 
economy, especially industry. As there is no machine industry in 
Pljevlja, it has come to the aid of many enterprises by 
manufacturing machine parts that were previously imported or 
manufactured in former Yugoslav republics. Production of a metal 
dormer window is under way for KID "Velimir Jakic," together 
with components for blinds, window reinforcements, and doors. 
  "The worst thing is to sit around and complain. Wages must 
be 
and, we are convinced, can be earned through labor," says 
engineer Slavko Krezovic, the head of the machine plant. 
  During our visit to the "1 December" enterprise, we saw that 
the collective was not giving in and succumbing to the problems 
that are present in abundance. The most valuable impression 
comes from the fact that the high-profile experts and all the 
employees are capable of independently producing very complex 
electronic equipment and systems under current circumstances. 
Nevertheless, renewed prosperity for the enterprise is expected 
only after the economic blockade is lifted. 
<H5>  [Box, p 37] </H5>
<H5>  First-Rate Equipment </H5>
  The "1 December" enterprise produces modern electronic and 
microwave machines, equipment, and systems. It has a closed 
technological process for producing electronic equipment at 
three production plants--the electrical plant, the machine 
plant, and the surface protection plant--with well-organized and 
professionally qualified services for technical preparation and 
quality control. The development sector deals with preparing and 
applying new technologies and products. The factory is equipped 
with top-rate equipment from the world's best-known producers. 
The electrical production plant has equipment for manufacturing 
microwave integral cars and modules for preparing and assembling 
stamped cars, measurement equipment for digital 
signal-processing, as well as an anachronous measurement room 
for recording antenna radiation diagrams at long range, with an 
automatic system for gathering data. 
  Mass production of the most complex parts and systems takes 
place in the modern machine plant using sheet metal of various 
thicknesses and qualities, while in the surface protection plant 
all sorts of galvanic and organic protection is done. 
<H5>  [Box, p 37] </H5>
<H5>  Through Its Own Devices </H5>
  An ambitious beginning was made in the manufacture of a 
large 
number of electronic devices. The first products were 
reconnaissance radar, a portable radar detector, and mechanical 
components for a radio-teleprinter system. In recent years, the 
development sector, through its own devices, has brought into 
"pilot" production a passive radio-direction finder for the 
acquisition, direction-finding, and tracking of low-flying air 
targets by azimuth, and a subsystem in an antiair system valued 
at more than $100,000.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Jaksic: "The Blackmailing of Former JNA </F>
Officers"] 
  [Text] Ljubljana 15 February -- It seems even officers of 
the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] have not been spared in 
the merciless showdowns between Slovene politicians, as 
eloquently indicated by the personal account in MLADINA of 
Ljubljana of Sefko Suljevic, a captain in the former JNA. He 
says that in Vienna, where he has applied for political asylum, 
he had a visit from officials of the Slovene Defense Ministry 
who asked him to supply them compromising material on Slovene 
President Milan Kucan and Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, 
and in return they would provide him all the necessary Slovene 
documents to return to his wife and children in Slovenacka 
Ribnica, from whom he has been virtually separated for nearly 
three years now. 
  Suljevic's story, however, is also of interest because of 
many other details indicative of the character of the brief war 
between the JNA and the Slovene militiamen and of the methods 
used at that time by Slovene paramilitary units in attacking 
garrisons or in unscrupulous showdowns even with those officers 
of the former JNA who wanted to join their ranks, as in fact was 
the case with Capt Suljevic, who was serving as 
counterintelligence officer in Ribnica. In spite of his 
"expressed loyalty to the Slovene state," then, Suljevic 
encountered the kind of violence and savagery he never expected 
to see even in his worst nightmare. 
  Suljevic first recalls the altogether unprovoked attack of 
the Slovene militiamen on the garrison in Ribnica, although 
Lojze Cesarek, territorial defense representative, had promised 
on behalf of territorial defense that the garrison would not be 
attacked. 
  After that Suljevic responded to the appeal of Slovene 
authorities that was sent to all officers of the JNA, he left 
the garrison and reported to Slovene territorial defense. He 
reported personally to Tone Krnovic, commander of the "Moris" 
Brigade, who incidentally is still the commanding officer of 
that unit, but in Ljubljana, where they took him, he experienced 
a real drama. 
  As soon as he arrived in Ljubljana, he was for all practical 
purposes arrested and taken to Krkovic in handcuffs. "They 
interrogated and beat me for four hours, and then they took me 
to some basement where they stripped me naked and put me before 
a firing squad. They gave me 20 seconds to tell them the names 
of my collaborators, I waited, leaning against the wall, for 
them to shoot me, and then someone came and took me out of that 
basement." 
  Suljevic's story then turns back upon itself, since after he 
was released from prison he went to Bar on a ship of the 
Yugoslav Navy, but again he decided to leave the JNA and to 
return to Slovenia, which again arranged a similar "welcome," 
until he ended up in Vienna, where he is still awaiting 
political asylum, but he is not giving up on his intention to 
return to Slovenia and join his family. The crowning touch is 
actually the sudden about-face in the behavior of the Slovene 
authorities towards him after the visit in Vienna by two men 
from the intelligence service of the Slovene Defense Ministry, 
who proposed that as a former counterintelligence officer he 
prepare material compromising Kucan and Drnovsek (that material, 
according to what he was told by those who visited him, is 
supposedly in Belgrade), and then the Defense Ministry would 
allow him to return to Slovenia. 
  Suljevic wrote a letter about this to Kucan and Drnovsek in 
which he gave the details of that blackmail attempt as well as 
the information that one of the two blackmailers was well-known 
to him. The only question was whether Kucan and Drnovsek would 
get on the trail and use the Suljevic case in the hot showdown 
with Janez Jansa, Slovene defense minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Lj.Z.: "There Is Still Enough Food"] </F>
  [Text] A surplus is expected in wheat, corn, oil, and some 
other basic staples. Minor seasonal shortages in sugar, 
potatoes, beans, meat, and eggs will be covered by imports. 
  This year nobody should go hungry. According to the 1994 
balance sheet prepared by the federal administration there will 
be surpluses of some basic commodities, while some shortages of 
meat, dairy products, and eggs, as well as the seasonal shortage 
of sugar and potatoes, could be covered by imports. In any case 
the federal government and two republic governments feel the 
food should be managed better than it was last year. Therefore, 
the government plans to make changes in its reserves of goods. 
Instead of three administrations there will be only one better 
organized and more reliable administration. 
  A projected daily consumer basket serving as the basis for 
this year's balance sheet contains a half-kilogram of bread 
(wheat), 40 grams of oil, 72 grams of sugar, 100 grams of 
potatoes, 14 grams of beans, 100 grams of meat, 350 grams of 
milk and dairy products, and 0.3 eggs per person. 
  It is not known whether the projected reserves were based on 
expected demand alone or whether the figures also include losses 
due to spoilage. The more important issue is how the projected 
quantities will be distributed. Economists and merchants have 
been asking the government for a long time to review the 
reserves and establish a rational mechanism for consumption. 
Last year's bad experience involving huge reserves of sugar that 
turned into shortages must not be repeated. 
  If one can rely on the federal administration's figures of 
annual consumption per person amounting to 180 kg of bread, 14 
liters of oil, 25.9 kg of sugar, 36 kg of potatoes, five kg of 
beans, 120 kg of meat, and 108 eggs, there will be significant 
surpluses in the government reserves at the end of this year. In 
fact, the expected surpluses amount to 3 million metric tons of 
wheat, 4.5 million tons of corn, 361,000 tons of oil, 288,000 
tons of sugar, 660,000 tons of potatoes, and 56,000 tons of 
beans. 
  All three governments will soon determine whether surplus 
food will be exported as a way of acquiring valuable hard 
currency and under what conditions. Of course, the answer to 
this question will depend on both economic and political 
conditions. If the sanctions are lifted, the food producers will 
doubtlessly be interested in making a profit on the 
international market.

<F P=106> [Article by Dimitrije Boarov: "Insulted and Isolated"] </F>
  [Text] It will take a very careful analysis of the 
transcript to perhaps discover something new about the affair of 
Dafiment Bank following the questioning of Mrs. Dafina Milanovic 
before a committee of inquiry of the Yugoslav Assembly (on 10 
February). At first glance the public and the committee of 
inquiry got nothing but what might have been expected. The main 
news is that Mrs. Dafina's defense seems to be aimed at passing 
the buck to the Yugoslav and Serbian bank governors, who "did 
not say `stop' at interest rates between 10 and 18 percent." The 
mother of Serbian banking said in all seriousness that she would 
have abided by a "decision" of any institution prohibiting 
contracts calling for such high rates of interest. 
  The second great sin of the National Bank of Serbia in Mrs. 
Dafina's opinion is that it did not agree to accept repayment of 
the loan granted in March of last year to Dafiment Bank, for 
which it had taken 251 kilograms of gold as collateral. During 
the questioning Mrs. Milanovic also stressed several times that 
her bank had never received a single dinar from primary issue, 
although she admitted indirectly that it had been purchasing 
foreign currencies on behalf of the National Bank of Serbia. 
Asked whether she had street dealers, she replied that that was 
a question to be put to all the banks. 
<H5>  Names To Be Named Later </H5>
  Mrs. Dafina expressed her most delicate charge against the 
bank governors in describing the days after the flight of her 
fellow banker, Master Jezda, and the collapse of Jugoskandik. At 
that time, she said, she begged those responsible to accept the 
"half-full vault of Dafiment Bank" in the State Treasury, but 
they supposedly refused. It was then that many began to come for 
their money with weapons in their hands, with hand grenades 
around their neck, with pistols and knifes. Asked to name names, 
Mrs. Dafina replied that she had already lost two children and 
had only one left. 
  In response to the anticipated question that she cite the 
names of politicians who withdrew their large deposits after the 
bank collapsed and allegedly took a profit of about 70 million 
marks [DM] in interest alone, even when everything had become 
clear, Dafina Milanovic said with a noticeable dose of 
bitterness that under a court order she would gladly present all 
those names "from all the political parties." In connection with 
a question about Milic from Macva she could not resist saying 
that "even those she did not know" wanted to have their picture 
taken with her at one time, but "now everyone shies away." 
  The list of basic "news items" might conclude with Mrs. 
Dafina's assertion that she always had all the permits, that her 
business was constantly being audited, and that no official 
record of an audit had charged her with shady dealing, but 
always were confined to technical deficiencies. Asked whether 
she had promptly paid her taxes, she cited a case when 
DM33,800,000 in taxes and fees were collected from her which the 
state now admits she did not owe -- but of course it is offering 
a nominal dinar refund of the overpaid tax. 
<H5>  The Gentlemanly Members of the Committee of Inquiry </H5>
  Trying to describe the dramatic tension which "conceived" 
this performance before the committee of inquiry of the Yugoslav 
Parliament is much more interesting than the early questioning. 
(Although the association is a bit unfortunate, it was all a bit 
like the film portrayal of Al Capone and other gentlemen from 
Chicago being questioned before Congress.) 
  Even before the session began in the Yugoslav Assembly, 
Revolution Boulevard was obstructed by a group of several 
hundred aggrieved depositors, but the police had obviously 
anticipated something of the kind, and traffic was quickly 
diverted to neighboring streets. The demonstrators were of 
course demanding their money, and one of the members of the 
committee of inquiry even complained that they had shouted to 
him that he was a thief. The group broke up rather quickly, they 
seemed to have been more persistent when waiting in line 
(according to recent estimates, Dafiment Bank owes about DM620 
million to 450,000 depositors, while its property and 
outstanding loans are estimated at about DM220 million). 
  Mrs. Dafina appeared before the committee of inquiry in a 
subdued mauve suit. This time there was no gold in the jewelry 
she wore, but there were precious stones in the silver ornaments 
that remained. Her demeanor was "firm," with a tearful component 
inserted whenever she mentioned children and the people. Deputy 
Kastratovic was advised that the committee of inquiry had not 
"brought" her there, but that she had come on her own to 
"justify her pledge" and that she was there because she knew 
people were hungry. In response to all the delicate questions, 
instead of the U.S. "No comment," Mrs. Dafina replied, "I will 
gladly answer that question in writing." One got the impression 
that the members of the committee of inquiry were more afraid of 
the questioning than Mrs. Dafina. Few people have ever before 
seen such delicacy and beating about the bush, purported 
understanding and gentlemanly etiquette in this parliamentary 
building. Everyone who put questions advised all those present 
"significantly" that Mrs. Dafina need not answer, since these 
matters were "delicate." Only the journalists were surprised 
that no one used such well-known verbs as to lie, to steal and 
to rob.

<H5>  The Resourceful Stalwarts in Montenegro </H5>
  It just so happened that Mrs. Dafina Milanovic was given an 
occasion for counterattack at the very outset of her appearance 
before the committee of inquiry. Asked about the melancholy fate 
of 12,000 depositors on the coast, who, by contrast with Jezda's 
victims in Podgorica, were short-changed, Mrs. Dafina had a 
ready answer. 
  According to her figures, an undischarged debt of DM7 
million 
remained of the DM19,800,000 that had been deposited in her 
Montenegrin branches. She also said that she had informed 
official authorities that her employees had misappropriated 
DM4,800,000, that is, that there is no documentation on that 
money at all and it never came into possession of Dafiment Bank. 
This is a crime, then, which the local authorities did not react 
to. Mrs. Dafina also complained that literally all the equipment 
had been hauled away from her offices in Podgorica, Herceg-Novi 
and other towns. 
  All in all, the now isolated owner of the largest bank in 
the 
Balkans said that in Montenegro she has damages amounting to DM3 
million more than her obligations, and she advises the 
depositors to apply to authorities in that republic, and she 
promises that she will make public the charge which she has 
filed with the competent authorities. 
<H5>  [Box, page 9] </H5>
<H5>  The Israeli Connection </H5>
  Deputy Strahinja Kastratovic was interested in the cofounder 
of the joint bank (that is, the one that obtained broad 
authority to handle foreign exchange), the now well-known Mr. 
Israel Kelman. Did this gentleman put up the founding capital, 
did he take out any profit, and did he transfer any money from 
the country "to Israel," Kastratovic asked. 
  Mrs. Dafina replied that in May 1992 Mr. Kelman put up a 
share of DM2,500,000 and after that had the status of an adviser 
to Dafiment Bank. She also declared with vigor that Mr. Kelman 
had not taken anything "to Israel." It is still unknown whether 
he took something to some other place. 
  Another Jewish name cropped up during the questioning of 
Mrs. 
Dafina. That is, she cited as one of the investments which time 
has confirmed to afford an attractive profit the purchase of a 
concession from the city of Belgrade to build a garage and to 
lease it for 30 years (70 percent of gross income) for DM20 
million. She said that her partner was Mr. David Dudal (if we 
heard her correctly), manager of the firm LD Electronic. 
  Deputy Zoran Krasic had Mrs. Dafina repeat the statement 
that 
she had insured her deposits abroad and that the firm was ready 
to come to her aid as soon as the sanctions are removed. It was 
not stated what firm this is (a certain "Jardino Ineurano Broker 
INT LTD" has been mentioned in the past), the amount of the 
insurance premium that might have been paid, nor whether this is 
once again some Jewish firm (if the firm in question exists at 
all).

<F P=106> [Article by Milos Markovic: "There Are Still Pianos To Be </F>
Bought"] 
  [Text] However much Mr. Avramovic has insisted that his 
"life and works" have been confined entirely to the functions of 
an expert, he learned quite well the basic political premises 
which his program must rest. The first is the persistent 
reminder that it was Slobodan Milosevic who initiated the 
drafting of this program, although Avramovic only loses thereby 
-- if he is successful in doing what he set out to do, he will 
have to share the glory with someone, and if he fails, he will 
be only yet another in the line of the discarded and forgotten. 
The other thing he knew he had to be mindful of (along with 
trifles such as the hard line against criticism, especially 
coming from the independent media, and the mentioning of Milan 
Panic only as a "bizarre detail in Yugoslav history") is the 
rejection of any similarity with the reform dating from the 
times of Ante Markovic. To that end he even offered the 
uninformed public the assertion that Markovic's program, unlike 
the present one, did not even aim to cover the public deficit. 
Anyone with a good memory will recall, however, that that 
program was centered on the fiscal sphere. For those who do not 
remember, it is sufficient to reflect on the fact that the 
Yugoslavia of that time, which was indeed larger, had built up 
almost $11 billion in foreign exchange reserves, so that it did 
not have to be so concerned about a budget deficit running to a 
few hundred million dollars, while the entire present project is 
actually based on $300 million. 
<H5>  Bringing Foreign Exchange Out Into the Open </H5>
  It is perhaps not logical to discuss right at the outset the 
political connotations of what is clearly an economic program 
whose initial results cannot be denied. The "foreign exchange 
specialists" in the street market even have such a high opinion 
of the superdinar that they are demanding no less than 10 German 
marks [DM] for 7 dinars. The Bureau of Statistics has published 
figures that the monthly level of inflation has dropped from a 
figure in the millions to 880 percent, although this was rather 
clumsy advertising concocted to support the program. 
Hyperinflation is literally cut short overnight, in the economic 
discipline there is no particular difference between one 
thousand percent and a million percent, so they should have 
waited a while before publishing the first results. The most 
recent information from the banks indicates that in the first 
two weeks of the program's implementation the economy and 
individuals have sold no less than DM70 million, although, given 
the immense shortage of both old and new dinars, the high taxes 
and current bills for electricity, other utilities, telephone 
and similar costs--there is reason to be skeptical about what 
that figure means. 
  The program for reconstruction of the monetary system, 
however, after the heady joy at the dinar in one's pocket being 
worth something after all, indeed even in shops that now have 
more goods, might well end in a hangover of realizing that life 
was better when people were running from store to store with a 
handful of bad checks. 
  The calculation is fairly obvious. The economic policy 
proposed for this year envisages an average net paycheck of $30, 
which comes to about DM50 (new dinars), a distinction being 
made, it is true, between what are called the effectively 
employed and those on mandatory leave, but even the former would 
not earn more than some DM60 (dinars). Pensions would of course 
be about 15 percent lower. 
  Anyone who in recent days has received the bills we 
mentioned 
for electricity, water, or telephone, anyone who has had to 
travel either by rail, bus, or air, will quickly note that an 
average earning of that amount does not guarantee even a daily 
loaf of bread and liter of milk. Although they have been 
extricated somewhat more honestly than previously, the very last 
household reserves of foreign exchange will have to "come out 
into the open" on behalf of mere survival. Everyone will finally 
have to take seriously the reason why a socialist leader at one 
time estimated that individuals were still holding about DM2 
billion. In order to take them away. 
  It is much the same with the economy. Just as the public is 
being served its favorite autocratic hot-and-cold policy (large 
price increases followed by loudly trumpeted partial 
reductions), so economic policymakers, although this is the job 
of the legislative branch, not theirs, are playing with taxes 
and fees on public and private firms. Coming after DM10,000, 
DM1,000 seems like an outright gift, and every drop of 1 percent 
in the tax rate seems like a gift from heaven. Given the 
circumstances that have prevailed up to now, every serious 
enterprise "took refuge" in foreign exchange, but now it is 
being force to sell that foreign exchange, since without dinars 
it cannot do business and meet a payroll. 
  There is no economist who could have anything against 
introduction of money that carries a real value or against real 
market prices for everything. This is truly the only basis on 
which on which a successful economy can be built. Nevertheless, 
the world has never recorded an example of a ruined economy 
combined with sound money, social peace maintained by not laying 
anyone off, and an anti-inflation program "which makes things 
better the very first day." 
  Avramovic's current program is good in that it will show 
everyone the degree to which the economy has been destroyed and 
what the standard of living of the population has been reduced 
to. In essence it legalizes everything that has been happening 
in the recent past, along with a noticeably hypocritical concern 
for so-called "old" foreign exchange savings depositors and 
naive support of the opposition in the formation of some kind of 
committees of inquiry to study the business operation of the 
private quasibanks. 
<H5>  An Unprecedented Combination </H5>
  People have been robbed repeatedly -- this program makes 
them 
clearly aware of that. And in a postscript it says that they are 
even in debt to the state and for that reason will have to sell 
what little foreign exchange they have left. Avramovic's cutting 
of the Gordian knot at the same time legalizes the right of all 
those who in the time of the Wild West amassed great wealth, 
either as private bankers, war profiteers or political bigwigs. 
The period of Balkan-style primitive accumulation of capital 
seems to be over. The time has come for them (the bigwigs) to 
assume even formal authority thanks to a solid and stable 
domestic currency, and for most of the population to finally 
realize the extent of their own pauperization and the place 
assigned them. 
  The public, deceived so many times, but always ready to 
accept fairy tales, myths, conspiracy theories, and similar 
stories without reservation, is already putting stock in the 
reasons why this program must succeed, similar to the hope it 
invested last year when the prophecy was that everything would 
change beginning in September. Namely, there is no reason to 
doubt that production will grow, and that the social product 
this year, just as in the projection of economic policy, will 
really increase by 5 percent. According to that story, which is 
not without a certain amount of rational analysis, the sanctions 
have to be removed soon, because the government and those close 
to it, who have been trading in petroleum and everything else 
under the sun, have already derived enough benefit for 
themselves from the blockade. And now, supposedly, they are in 
good humor and will be doing everything for removal of the 
sanctions. Or, more simply, they have amassed all they want, and 
now they will presumably give us something. 
  However, whereas real estate is cheaper than it has been 
since 1957, according to a TV ad of one of the real estate 
firms, and prices on the art objects market have literally been 
cut in half, stock should not be put in this theory. There are 
still pianos to be bought.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Grlickov] </F>
  [Text] The reactions of bankers to the enactments in the 
monetary and foreign exchange sphere can be briefly reduced to 
the following: The enactments based on the Program for 
Reconstruction of the Monetary System and Yugoslavia's Economic 
Recovery are being supported, and the criticism is being 
directed toward oversights and deficiencies in preparation of 
the program's application. 
  Dragoljub Vukosavljevic, president of Union Bank, is 
critical 
of the poor preparation for practical implementation of the 
program in view of the fact that all the enactments were not 
adopted on time. He therefore poses the question whether the 
bank will be able to prove the origin of foreign exchange and 
foreign currencies when it purchases them for new convertible 
dinars; that is, how much will be expected of it in relations 
with the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia]. If the objective is 
to activate holdings of foreign exchange, foreign currencies, 
and gold in banks and firms, one can guess the answer to the 
question. Toma Nedeljkovic of the NBJ has said in this 
connection that they will not be calling for the origin of 
foreign exchange and currency, since a kind of legalization of 
these reserves has already taken place through previous 
commitments and enactments. A separate question is whether and 
to what extent foreign exchange reserves tied to the issue of 
the new dinars should be transferred to the NBJ, as it would be 
better, according to Vitomir Janjuz, director of the Belgrade 
Credit Bank, that they remain in the bank (with the convertible 
dinar as an element of their security). One particular problem 
might be a shortage of new dinars at the outset to cover the 
foreign exchange and currency that the public is ready to offer 
to the banks. That might suggest the conclusion that there will 
be no dinars in cash even if foreign exchange and currencies are 
offered to the NBJ. 
  There is some question about the foreign exchange reserves 
in 
the amount of $200 million envisaged as the basis of for issuing 
the new dinars. The $200 million cannot be expected to service 
the anticipated social product of $10 billion. To achieve that, 
the money supply would have to have an extremely high rate of 
turnover, one that is not possible anywhere in the world today, 
says Milo Kaponja of Centrobanka, pointing out the problem of 
the scant foreign exchange reserves. 
  The foreign exchange reserves are not sufficient to cover 
the 
lending operations of the banks, and it is not good to create 
the impression that they have excessive holdings. Those holdings 
are mostly committed already in industry or are in accounts 
abroad. In any case, the reserves would be quickly spent, and 
unless there are essential changes in the structure of the 
state, the economy and banking, the program will soon come to an 
end. Milomir Spasic, general manager of Slavija Bank, believes 
that it will all come down to expenditure of the foreign 
exchange reserves unless there are changes and support within 
industry. The chances of that happening are slim at present. 
  As to supplying the foreign exchange reserves to carry out 
the program, the bankers support the idea of turning old foreign 
exchange savings into public debt of the state, covered by a 
three-year moratorium. they suggest in this connection that 
minimum payouts of savings nevertheless be made to the poorest 
segments of the population. At the same time, it would be good 
to establish the real balance of that debt, since it could 
differ from what has been recorded as foreign exchange savings 
deposited in the National Bank of Yugoslavia. 
  It is seen as a good sign that the program contains a break 
with social ownership and a pity that it was not accompanied by 
adoption of an enactment to that effect. It would perhaps be 
good in this connection for property in the form of goods and 
real estate to be used more as collateral to cover bank loans 
(mortgages and secured loans), which can in turn be taken as 
criticism of the policy of linking primary note issue 
exclusively to coverage consisting of foreign exchange, 
currencies and gold. 
  The entire program, says Ratko Djuric of Agrobanka, is based 
on reform of the monetary and fiscal systems and essentially 
represents an effort to consolidate budget deficits. Nothing is 
said in the program about primary distribution, prices, 
disparities, and the like, which was added (with or without the 
knowledge of the program's authors) to the enactments. 
  The main problem with the program and the enactments is that 
they do not furnish sufficient foreign exchange reserves to 
carry it out. Toma Nedeljkovic of the NBJ remains an optimist 
concerning this question from the bankers, hoping that support 
for the program will nevertheless come from the IMF. The program 
does contain elements the IMF poses as a condition for 
furnishing countries support. But that is still a long way from 
specific support, and without that there is no chance of lasting 
success and recovery. Of course any departures from vital 
commitments in the program, such as those related to the budget 
deficit, and especially the fact that its expenditures have not 
been reduced this time either, could raise the question of how 
long it will last.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "What Became of 251 Kilograms of </F>
Dafina's Gold"] 
  [Text] At a news conference held at the National Bank of 
Yugoslavia [NBJ] just before the beginning of the weekend, 
journalists asked Bozidar Gazivoda, vice governor of the NBJ, 
the following question: "What has become of the 251 kilograms of 
gold that Dafina Milanovic once gave to the National Bank of 
Serbia, and on what basis did she get a loan worth more than 20 
million German marks at the time?" 
  "We do not know that such gold exists at all in our main 
branch for Serbia, but we will seek an answer and will inform 
you about it," was the response. 
  Answering the question whether, with the adoption of the new 
law on the National Bank of Yugoslavia and the transformation of 
republic national banks into its branches, the former banks of 
Serbia and Montenegro had merged all their foreign exchange 
reserves with those of the country, Gazivoda answered tersely: 
"They have not, in spite of our demands. We will persist with 
them." 
  Otherwise, the value of the 251 kilograms of gold that 
Dafina 
Milanovic deposited at the beginning of 1993 as security for 
credit at the National Bank of Serbia -- which still existed at 
that time -- and on the basis of which she received a 450 
billion dinar short-term credit, calculated at the average price 
of gold at the London stock market, is a little less than 5 
million German marks.

<F P=106> [Article by R.N.: "Dr. Savic: I Am Opposed to </F>
Production-Secured Financing"] 
  [Text] Even if there were to be any financing of industry 
before the end of the first quarter this year, it would have to 
be secured by hard currency deposited by the companies. Issuing 
the new dinar based on production of goods would create a 
situation in which a dinar with hard currency backing would be 
replaced by a dinar based on the production of goods for which 
no reliable market has been verified. This was stated yesterday 
by Dr. Nebojsa Savic, a member of the team of experts 
participating in the creation of the new economic program. The 
comment was made in response to the latest credit approval for 
IMT [Industry of Machines and Tractors]. The primary mechanism 
of financing, in Dr. Savic's opinion, should not be connected 
with the Central Bank, but with commercial banks that would 
determine whether the programs they finance are justifiable, 
i.e., whether the companies would be able to secure their 
liquidity and acquire new dinars by selling their products. 
  Dr. Savic believes that if a company obtains credit through 
an agreement with a commercial bank, that is a two-way deal 
because it involves a definite interest rate and a repayment 
deadline within 90 days. 
  However, Dr. Savic points out that the main purpose of the 
new economic plan was to have solid currency, the new dinar, 
fully backed by hard currency, which would make it possible to 
introduce the new dinar into all transactions. "My idea is that 
we should remain within this firm monetary regime and financial 
discipline until the end of the first quarter and only then 
consider ways of activating some other possibilities," Dr. Savic 
said. After all, the firm financial discipline, requiring 
companies to deposit their hard currency, was designed for the 
purpose of extracting the hard currency which the companies used 
in what were termed illegal transactions among themselves. For 
this reason, Dr. Savic stresses that during this quarter 
production should not be accepted as backing for financing.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Elipton From the 
Potty" on pages 26 and 27 of the 21 February edition of the 
Belgrade weekly VREME, Dragan Todorovic reports on a 
fact-finding trip to investigate the manufacture of the 
"elipton" bomb, "a superpowerful electronic-laser weapon which 
no one else possesses, after the use of which nothing remains 
alive, and which does not produce the aftereffects of 
radiation." VREME reports that Vladimir Zhirinovksiy, the leader 
of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia, had given the elipton 
to Zeljko Raznjatovic-Arkan. Key components of the bomb, VREME 
adds, are to be produced at the "Elektron" factory in Sabac 
owned by Tomislav Simic. In a Sabac news conference, VREME 
states, Simic had described the elipton as "a small box like a 
Geiger counter with a small antenna which serves as the personal 
weapon of every soldier" and announced that his factory would 
begin serial production of electronic parts for the elipton "in 
the middle of next year." 
  According to VREME, Elektron is located on a large square in 
a one-story building pasted over with Arkan election posters. 
There was a blue Mercedes belonging Mr. Simic in front of the 
building, so "we thought we were in luck." However, the VREME 
group found only a doorman and a "close associate" of Simic, who 
informed them that Simic was not there, that he has been 
traveling a lot lately. The associate said that he was not 
competent to discuss the elipton but that Elektron was a 
reputable, well-established firm that is presently involved in 
the wholesale marketing of a "wide assortment of goods." 
  VREME reports that the associate was unable to tell them 
anything about the firm's production but that he showed the 
group a brochure on the town of Sabac in which Elektron is 
presented as an export-import firm dealing in electronics 
production and services. "Thus, we remained convinced that any 
type of production, if there is any, is a secret, because, 
except for the doorman, a close collaborator, and a long 
corridor with several doors, we did not see anything. It seems 
that Mr. Simic is above all a philanthropist, because his close 
associate kept repeating how much he had given and continues to 
give to children and the socially deprived. He mentioned a sum 
of 200,000 German marks and the construction of a church, and he 
led us to a room with a sign on the door that said `Trade 
Office,' where there were piles of used clothing. He told us 
that the room used to be full but that everything had been given 
to the people." 
  The VREME group, leaving the factory, went down the road to 
an Elektron store to see some of the factory's products. In the 
window there were a little plastic crocodile and an inflated 
duck. "Not a single trace of technology, especially not a secret 
one," VREME comments. 
  VREME reports that the brochure on the town of Sabac states 
that Elektron employs about 60 workers, that it has retail 
stores, that it produces microtransformers for main telephone 
exchanges, and that it conducts business all over the world. It 
also notes that Elektron manufactures a potty-chair which plays 
music. VREME found out from Sabac residents that most of the 
data in the brochure were no longer valid. "If there ever was 
any production, there is none now," VREME states, adding that 
"only a potty-chair which plays music remains. Mr. Simic 
patented the potty-chair in the mid-1980's, building into it a 
mechanism which, in contact with fluid, plays music. It was a 
good deal, people say. Kids used to run to the potty," VREME 
concludes.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Slobodan Milosevic announced 
Tuesday to whom he wants entrust the leadership of the Serbian 
Government. He decided on Mirko Marjanovic, 57-year-old director 
of the well-known Belgrade import-export firm Progres. At the 
same time it was revealed how Milosevic plans to ensure 
Marjanovic's election, even though Socialists do not have a 
majority in the Assembly. A small Serbian party, New Democracy, 
which had participated in the DEPOS [Democratic Movement of 
Serbia] coalition as an ally of the SPO [Serbian Renewal 
Movement] and gained five deputies in the Serbian Assembly, 
decided to support Marjanovic and leave the DEPOS. Its leader 
Dragoslav Mihajlovic might become deputy prime minister in 
Marjanovic's government. Therefore, there is no doubt that 
Marjanovic will be elected. The matter was settled by clever 
party politics, the Serbian way. When other opposition parties 
realized that they had been tricked and that the Socialists were 
shrewder, as in the election for president of the Parliament, 
they switched their to support to Marjanovic, saying that he is 
an apolitical choice since he is a businessman and will 
supposedly lead a government of experts capable of later forming 
a government of national unity, which would consist of ministers 
from the Socialist and opposition parties. Belgrade papers are 
already predicting that Marjanovic may even include some people 
from the opposition right from the start. 
  Mirko Marjanovic has a very interesting biography that 
reveals why Milosevic selected him. He was born in Knin in 1937. 
He is a Croatian Serb. He graduated from the high school in Knin 
and earned a degree at the Belgrade School of Economics. In 1961 
he was employed in Knin at Tvik, a factory producing screws, 
where he eventually elbowed his way up to become deputy 
director. In 1973 he left for the Belgrade firm Progres. 
  Now we have to tell something about Progres. It is not an 
ordinary enterprise. It ranked among the leading Serbian 
import-export firms next to Genex and Inex. These were the firms 
that had at their disposal all the wealth of the former 
Yugoslavia. They enjoyed political and military support and 
concluded large business deals abroad as covers for the former 
Yugoslav State Security. In this way Serbia was able to create 
income for itself at the expense of the former Yugoslavia. 
  As soon as Marjanovic joined Progres, he was sent as its 
representative to Moscow, which proves that he also worked for 
the secret police. Then he climbed fast and in 1979 he became 
director general of Progres, the post he has retained until now. 
Belgrade Television reported the news of his candidacy with the 
comment that Progres made great steps forward under his 
stewardship. It deals in exports and imports in the areas of 
heavy industry, construction, agriculture, and natural gas. 
  Mirko Marjanovic is a member of the Serbian Socialist Party 
although he has not been politically active, which is probably 
why Slobodan Milosevic selected him in these difficult times. 
Because Marjanovic is a man without a public political past, 
there will not be much discussion about his candidacy, as 
illustrated by the initial reaction of the opposition parties. 
Since his election is practically assured because of the 
"betrayal" of New Democracy, the opposition is not trying too 
hard, at least not in public, to undermine him. This way, 
Milosevic has secured his rule under new circumstances, snuffed 
out parties' threats, and ensured a new period of political and 
social stability, partially because the economic program, which 
began with the introduction of the super dinar, is still 
thriving despite the malevolent forecasts. If nothing else, it 
has succeeded in lowering inflation. With Marjanovic, Milosevic 
has "bought" more time for the survival of his regime.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dusan Mihajlovic, president of New </F>
Democracy, by Verica Rupar; place and date not given: "The Time 
of One-Party Systems Is Gone"] 
  [Text] It is almost certain that ministers who are members 
of New Democracy, one of the founding parties of the Democratic 
Movement of Serbia [DEPOS], will be sitting in the new republic 
government along with the representatives of the Socialist Party 
of Serbia [SPS], the largest party in the parliament. 
  Dusan Mihajlovic, the leader of New Democracy, does not wish 
for now to go into details. "Parliamentary life is a process, 
not an act; it is a skill, an interest, and reality and not a 
moral contest," he says at the beginning of the interview. 
  Mihajlovic is, by his own definition, a "lawyer from 
Valjevo, 
on temporary work in Belgrade, and before that a scout and an 
explorer." He is remembered as a vice president of the Executive 
Council of Serbia (in 1990), as a politician who chaired the 
first roundtable of the government and the opposition in Serbia. 
  New Democracy, until a recent separation of the delegate 
club 
of DEPOS, participated in the political life of Serbia, one 
could say, from the shadows. Today it is one of the parties that 
spurs certain controversies. 
  [Rupar] What is the place of New Democracy on the political 
scene of Serbia? How do you comment on the comment that the 
party was founded by DEPOS and on the rumors that what is 
involved is a branch of the SPS? 
  [Mihajlovic] New Democracy is one of the first registered 
political parties in Serbia. DEPOS did not give it birth, as it 
did to some other parties, but New Democracy is one of four 
equal founders of DEPOS. 
  The rumors that it is a branch of the SPS are spread by 
precisely those who would themselves like to fall into the arms 
of the SPS. We have our own political program whose essence is 
local self-management and regionalism, surpassing conventional 
politics, and seeking the so-called third path. In general, we 
believe that without private ownership there is no true 
democracy. Until then, political life will be full of beautiful 
but empty talk, a lot of demagogy and struggling for power. This 
is why one could rather say that it is the SPS that is coming 
close to the views of New Democracy. 
  [Rupar] What does that concretely mean? 
  FMihajlovic] In a concrete situation, New Democracy 
implements its belief in the need for national and political 
compromise. It is more important for all of us to have a better 
life than to listen to malicious comments of idlers who like to 
judge everyone on everything except themselves and their acts. 
We are not accusing those leaders who talked with the president 
of the republic and who want a government of national unity. On 
the contrary, we believe that this is the only correct road. 
  [Rupar] Under what conditions would New Democracy accept 
participation in the government; would you personally assume 
some of the functions? 
  [Mihajlovic] New Democracy believes that the time of 
one-party rule, whether by the SPS or the opposition, is gone 
forever. We have to get used to coalition. The offer of the 
president of the republic to form a government of national unity 
with the program formulated by Mr. Avramovic is in accordance 
with the program of New Democracy and its real interests. 
  The electoral result makes both the government and the 
opposition obligated to the agreement on the division of power 
and responsibility for the fate of its people. No trivial 
partisan or personal excuses can be a justification for fleeing 
from the responsibility to our voters. When are we going to be 
patriots if not now? 
  As concerns my participation in the government, it is known 
that I have already been a vice president. That means that I am 
over that ambition, as well as over the phase of a desire for 
power. New Democracy is not a party contending for power, and I 
am happy that there are many better and smarter people than I 
who will carry this out in a better and more successful way. 
  [Ruper] How do you assess relations within the opposition? 
What is it that prevents the establishment of a strong 
parliamentary democracy in Serbia? 
  [Mihajlovic] We are still in the puberty phase in the 
development of democracy and parliamentarism. The government 
successfully controls the opposition. The majority of parties 
have not freed themselves of dissident habits, they know what 
they are against but not what they are for. Also, many do not 
understand the essence of politics, politics as a democratic 
struggle for power, and are not ready to accept the 
responsibility which comes along with participation in the 
parliament and the government. 
  [Ruper] What are your relations with the Socialists? 
  [Mihajlovic] They did not exist until the last negotiations 
in the parliament, although I am, of course, a personal friend 
of many people who, otherwise, are members of the SPS. 
Otherwise, I think that nobody wants to share power, and neither 
does the SPS. Power is shared only if one has to. And the 
present situation is good for both democracy and the people. 
  [Ruper] What is your political prognosis? 
  [Mihajlovic] I would not be involved in politics if I were 
not an optimist. I believe in peace, in the return to the 
international community, privatization, successful people. I 
will support successful forming of the government of national 
unity and the resolving of the problems that have accumulated. 
Are we going to succeed this time? This does not depend only on 
me. Blackmail and reducing problems to a personal level are not 
allowed. What would the government achieve if I were the only 
leader, and there were no others. It is a poor country that has 
only one leader.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 2 December 1993 issue of Belgrade 
VOJSKA, the weekly published by the Federal Ministry of Defense, 
carries on page 22 an article by Petar Boskovic about a 
fact-finding visit to two Yugoslav Army garrisons in the Raska 
[Sandzak] region. In talks with the garrisons' commanders, 
Colonel Zlatko Radisavljevic of the Raska garrison and 
Lieutenant Colonel Milutin Petronijevic of the Novi Pazar 
garrison, VOJSKA was informed that the two garrisons cover a 
large area of the Raska region with an overall Muslim majority 
(52 percent), though the percentage varies from place to place. 
For example, VOJSKA states, in Tutin the population is only 2 
percent Serbian, and the sitution is similar in the villages of 
Dunisici, Fijulje, Mitrova, and Dubovo. It should be stressed, 
VOJSKA adds, that until recently all these places had Serbian 
majorities. 
  "This is a region that has been known for draft-dodging and 
boycotting of the former Yugoslav People's Army and the present 
Yugoslav Army. Even the small number of recruits called up 
encounters the strong disapproval of the locality. During the 
war one could feel increased nationalism and intolerance toward 
Serbia and everything that is Serbian. Disrespect of the 
government and creation of a parallel government, purchase of 
weapons and forming of paramilitary units is just a small part 
of the `green [Muslim] transversal' that crosses this region. A 
large number of recruits, in order to avoid mobilization, left 
with their families for Bosnia before the war, where they later 
became active in the Muslim units, and sent their families back 
to Serbia where they are now treated as refugees," Commander 
Radisavljevic said to VOJSKA. 
  The situation in Raska is now different, VOJSKA states, and 
the "green transversal" has been broken in several places, among 
others at the Rogozna plateau, where intensive work is being 
carried out to revive poor Serbian villages. A new police 
station has been set up, and the army is building roads. Budjevo 
village in Pesterska plateau, where Muslims slaughtered about 
100 Serbs during World War II, has been given priority. The 
action is called "Budjenje Budjeva" [The awakening of Budjevo] 
in which all well-intentioned inhabitants, including quite a few 
Muslims, are participating, VOJSKA states, adding that everyone 
agrees that the army is a great factor of security in this 
region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Pesticides Coming in Without </F>
Licenses"] 
  [Text] "Recently one has been able to notice a trend of 
uncontrolled importation of pesticides in our country, which is 
confirmed by the results of the inspections carried out by 
expert institutions, firms, and associations active in this 
field, as well as by the Customs, the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, and the media." This is said in the statement issued by 
the Government of Serbia regarding the uncontrolled importation 
of pesticides, and traffic in dangerous chemical substances. 
POLITIKA has already written on this subject in one of the 
previous issues. 
  The statement also specifies that the sanctions, economic 
difficulties, and high prices of the substances manufactured in 
Yugoslavia actually encourage such an attitude of the farmers, 
who are trying to cope with difficulties by obtaining pesticides 
from abroad, and it is mostly pesticides that are either 
prohibited or not recommended for use in the world. 
  In addition, there is a widespread practice abroad that the 
dangerous substances and pesticides, whose date has expired, are 
exported to the underdeveloped countries of the third world, and 
to the transition countries of Eastern and Central Europe. 
  In the past several months the Ministry for Environment has 
come across precisely such cases of traffic and use of 
pesticides with expired dates. The latest case reported is that 
of Jagodina, where 100 kilograms of such pesticides were found. 
  "According to data issued by the Association for the 
Protection of Yugoslav Flora, last year's needs for supplies of 
substances for the protection of plants amounted to 10,000 
metric tons. Some 8,500 tons were produced in the country, 
while nearly 1,800 tons were imported. This year the production 
of 11,000 tons of pesticides has been planned," it is said in 
the statement. 
  The government also states that the Association of Pesticide 
Manufacturers of Yugoslavia, as well as the Institute for Flora 
Protection in Belgrade, issued a warning to the Ministry of 
Agriculture on 18 January this year, that last year, within 11 
months, pesticides were imported through more than 120 agencies, 
while only a part of the number had licenses issued by the 
government. As for the rest, it is not known either who issued 
the licenses or who carried out the analysis.

<F P=106> [Article by D.D.: "Today First Quantities of Paper"] </F>
  [Text] The Matroz newsprint manufacturing factory will 
probably start operating its machines today, according to an 
agreement between the factory's management and the responsible 
ministries of the Government of Serbia and representatives of 
the newspaper publishing houses. Deputy General Director Stanko 
Zivkovic enumerated several problems which make the start up of 
the factory's operations difficult and expressed hope that they 
will not be insurmountable. The greatest problem is the delivery 
of crude oil through the Iriski Venac, where the traffic is 
difficult, especially for heavy tank trucks. Matroz does not 
even have the minimum supply of crude oil and is unable to start 
the production. Six tank trucks were supposed to arrive 
yesterday, but only four did, and today only four of eight 
scheduled trucks arrived. 
  "Just putting the machines in operation is not without 
risk," 
Zivkovic says. "The machines were idle for an entire month, and 
it is not easy to start even a car if it has not been operated 
for that amount of time. But there is hope that everything will 
be okay." 
  In the early afternoon hours the factory had still not 
started to operate. Three to four hours are needed to start 
producing the first quantities of paper. Zivkovic says that some 
paper could start to be delivered to the newspaper publishing 
houses as early as tomorrow.

representative, provided that more than half the number of all 
eligible voters in the district voted. 
  7.2. If fewer than half the number of eligible 
voters cast ballots in the first round of elections 
(hereinafter: invalid round of elections), 
  7.2.a. all candidates running in the first round 
of elections may run in a second round of elections; 
  7.2.b. and the candidate receiving the largest 
number of valid votes cast shall become a National Assembly 
representative, provided that more than one-fourth the number of 
all eligible voters in the district voted. 
  7.3. If in the first round of elections more than 
half the number of eligible voters cast votes, but no candidate 
receives more than half the number of valid votes cast 
(hereinafter: unsuccessful round of elections), 
  7.3.a. candidates running and having received no 
less than 15 percent of the valid votes cast in the first round 
of elections may run in the second round of elections; if fewer 
than three candidates received at least 15 percent of the valid 
votes cast, the three candidates receiving the largest number of 
votes in the first round of elections may run in the second 
round of elections; 
  7.3.b. and the candidate receiving the largest 
number of valid votes shall become a National Assembly 
representative, provided that more than one-fourth the number of 
all eligible voters in the district voted. 
  7.4. Parties jointly nominating a candidate to run 
in an individual voting district shall inform the election board 
no less than eight days prior to the elections of the proportion 
in which fractional votes are to be credited to the two or more 
parties' national aggregate number of fractional votes. 
  7.5. Special elections shall be held if no first 
or second rounds of election were held in an individual voting 
district due to the lack of a candidate. (Paragraph 46.) 
  8.1. Candidates whose names appear on the various 
party slates in regional voting districts shall receive their 
mandates in the order they are listed on the various party 
slates and in proportion to the number of votes cast for each 
party slate, provided that more than half the number of eligible 
voters cast votes. The proportionate allocation of votes cast to 
the various party slates shall be made pursuant to the formula 
specified in the Appendix to this Law. 
  8.2. If the first round of elections in a regional 
voting district is invalid because fewer than half the number of 
eligible voters voted, all party slates competing in the first 
round of elections may compete in the second round of elections. 
Candidates whose names appear on the various party slates shall 
receive their mandates in proportion to the number of votes cast 
for each party slate, provided that more than one-fourth the 
number of eligible voters have voted. The proportionate 
allocation of votes cast to the various party slates shall be 
made pursuant to the formula specified in the Appendix to this 
Law. 
  8.3. If after the proportionate allocation of 
votes cast for the various party slates pursuant to Paragraphs 
8.1. and 8.2. a mandate remains unallocated, the candidate 
receiving more than two-thirds the number of votes required to 
receive a mandate--although fewer votes than otherwise required 
for the allocation of a mandate--shall also receive a mandate. 
From among several candidates receiving more than two-thirds the 
number of votes, but fewer than the number of votes otherwise 
required for a mandate, the candidate receiving the highest 
number of votes shall receive the mandate. Upon completion of 
the above process, unallocated mandates shall be added to the 
number of mandates available from the national slate. 
  8.4. If a mandate is acquired pursuant to 
Paragraph 8.3., the difference between the number of votes 
required to acquire a mandate, and the number of votes actually 
cast for the candidate shall be deducted from the national 
aggregate number of fractional votes allocated to the party that 
nominated the candidate. 
  8.5. A candidate running on a regional slate shall 
be deemed to have failed to acquire a mandate pursuant to 
Paragraphs 8.1.-8.3., unless he received more than two-thirds 
the number of votes cast needed to acquire a mandate in the 
given voting district, and more than four percent of the 
national aggregate number of votes cast for the various regional 
party slates. 
  8.6. Parties announcing combined slates at least 
eight days prior to the elections shall receive mandates in 
proportion to the aggregate number of votes cast for their 
slates of candidates. When announcing combined slates of 
candidates, the sequence in which individual candidates are 
slated to receive mandates shall also be announced. Such 
announcement shall be made public by the election board. 
  8.7. Parties fielding joint or combined slates in 
regional voting districts shall inform the election board no 
less than eight days prior to the elections of the proportion in 
which their remaining fractional votes are to be allocated to 
the national aggregate number of fractional votes. 
  8.8. In the event that two or more parties receive 
identical numbers of votes entitling each to receive mandates, 
and if fewer mandates are available in the regional voting 
district than the number of parties receiving identical numbers 
of votes, the mandates shall be allocated in the sequence the 
various parties appear on the ballot form. 
  8.9. Special elections shall be held if, due to 
the lack of party slates, no first or second rounds of election 
were held in a regional voting district. (Paragraph 46.) 
  9.1. Candidates fielded on the national slates 
shall receive their mandates in proportion to the national 
aggregate number of fractional votes, and in the order of the 
announcement of such fractional votes. The following shall be 
regarded as fractional votes: 
  9.1.a. votes cast for candidates fielded by 
parties in individual voting districts in the first valid round 
of elections, which resulted in no mandate in either round of 
elections; and 
  9.1.b. votes cast for slates in a regional voting 
district in a valid round of elections, which were insufficient 
for a mandate, or were in excess of the number of votes required 
for a mandate. 
  9.2. Votes cast in an invalid round of elections 
shall not be regarded as fractional votes and therefore shall be 
disregarded from the standpoint of mandates to be acquired from 
national slates. Similarly, the number of votes cast for a 
party's regional slate, whose national aggregate number of votes 
does not exceed four percent of the national aggregate number of 
votes cast for the regional slates of all parties, shall not be 
regarded as fractional votes. 
  9.3. Parties having filed notice no later than 
eight days prior to the elections of their intent to combine 
their national slates shall receive mandates in proportion to 
the combined total number of fractional votes allocated to their 
slates. When providing such notice to the National Election 
Board, the parties shall also state the sequence in which the 
candidates receive their mandates. Such notice shall be made 
public by the National Election Board.

<H6>  Appendix 4(Paragraph 52.d.) </H6>
  Method of calculation for tallying votesand for 
determining the outcome of elections 
  I. Individual voting district 
  1. Valid and invalid round of election: 
  (a) Valid first round of election 
  A first round of election is valid if more than half the 
number of eligible voters cast votes 
  (b) Invalid first round of election 
  A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or 
fewer eligible voters cast votes. 
  (c) Valid second round of election 
  A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful 
first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is valid if more 
than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. 
  (d) Invalid second round of election 
  A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful 
first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is invalid if fewer 
than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. 
  2. Successful or unsuccessful round of election: 
  (a) Successful first round of election 
  A valid first round of election is successful (Point 1/a) if 
a candidate receives more than half the number of votes cast. 
  (b) Unsuccessful first round of election 
  A valid first round of election is unsuccessful (Point 1/a) 
if no candidate receives more than half the number of votes cast. 
  (c) Successful second round of election 
  A valid second round of election after a valid (Point 1/a) 
or 
invalid (Point 1/b) first round of election is successful if the 
votes cast for the various candidates differ. 
  (d) Unsuccessful second round of election 
  A valid second round of election (Point 1/c) is unsuccessful 
if the candidates received equal numbers of votes. 
  In individual voting districts the candidate receiving in 
the 
valid round of election the number of votes specified in Points 
2/a or 2/c shall become the National Assembly representative. 
  II. Regional voting district 
  1. Valid and invalid round of election: 
  (a) Valid first round of election 
  A first round of election is valid if more than half the 
number of eligible voters cast votes. 
  (b) Invalid first round of election 
  A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or 
fewer eligible voters cast votes. 
  (c) Valid second round of election 
  A second round of election after an invalid first round of 
election (Point 1/b) is valid if more than one-fourth the number 
of eligible voters cast votes. 
  (d) Invalid second round of election 
  A second round of election after an invalid first round of 
election (Point 1/b) is invalid if one-fourth the number of 
eligible voters or fewer eligible voters cast votes. 
  2. Preconditions for calculating the outcome of regional 
slate election results: 
  (a) national tally of votes cast for regional slates, 
separately per party; 
  (b) identification of parties whose national vote total does 
not exceed the four percent margin established in Paragraph 8.5. 
of the Law. 
  3. Calculating results in a valid round of elections held in 
a regional voting district: 
  (a) The number of votes cast for the various parties' 
electoral slates shall be added up (hereinafter: the total 
number of valid votes). 
  (b) One additional mandate shall be added to the number of 
mandates that can be obtained in a voting district (hereinafter: 
divider). 
  (c) The total number of valid votes shall be divided by the 
divider. The quotient thus derived represents the number of 
votes needed to acquire a mandate. 
  (d) The number representing two-thirds of the number of 
votes 
needed to acquire a mandate shall be calculated (hereinafter: 
two-thirds limit). 
  (e) The number of votes cast for a given party slate shall 
be 
divided by the number of votes required to acquire a mandate. 
The whole number derived as a result of the division equals the 
number of mandates acquired by the party, in due regard to the 
provisions of Paragraph 8.8. of the Law. The remainder after the 
division, as well as votes not resulting in mandates constitute 
fractional votes. 
  (f) If, after the division pursuant to Point (e) there 
remains an unallocated mandate, parties receive mandates in the 
declining order of fractional votes cast for parties, up to the 
two-thirds limit. If all mandates are distributed in a given 
voting district, no additional mandates shall be distributed, 
irrespective of the two-thirds limit. Except for fractional 
votes defined in Paragraph 8.4. of the Law, fractional votes not 
resulting in mandates shall be added to the national slate. 
  (g) After completing the calculation specified in Point (f), 
above, in a regional voting district, the still unallocated 
mandates shall be added to the national slate. 
  III. Distribution of mandates that can be 
acquiredfrom national slates based on fractional votes 
  1. Fractional votes resulting in individual and regional 
voting districts (Paragraphs 9.1.a. and 9.1.b.) shall be added 
up on a nationwide basis separately for each party, in due 
regard to the provisions of Paragraph 8.4 of the Law 
(hereinafter: total number of fractional votes cast for a party). 
  2. The number of fractional votes cast for all the parties 
throughout the country shall be a added up (hereinafter: 
national fractional vote). 
  3. The number of mandates not allocated from regional slates 
(Point II/3/g) shall be added to the maximum number of mandates 
that can be acquired from the national slate (58). 
  4. The national aggregate number of fractional votes shall 
be 
divided by the number of unallocated mandates per Point 3 above. 
The resultant quotient shall represent the number of votes 
required to allocate a mandate. 
  5. The number of fractional votes cast for any given party 
shall be divided by the number of votes required for the 
allocation of a mandate. The whole number quotient derived as a 
result of the division shall represent the number of mandates to 
be allocated to any given party. Fractions and fractional votes 
not resulting in mandates shall be the repeat fractional votes 
(hereinafter: repeat fractional votes). 
  6. If after the division specified in Point 5 above there 
remains an unallocated mandate, the number of repeat fractional 
votes shall be divided by the number of unallocated mandates. 
This calculation produces the number of votes required for 
allocating one mandate. The allocation of mandates shall be 
continued based on the new quotient and on repeat fractional 
votes in a declining order, until the number of mandates shown 
in Point 3 above are allocated. 
  7. If, after completing the calculation pursuant to Point 6 
above, there remain unallocated mandates, the calculation shall 
be repeated after deducting the already allocated mandates and 
the number of votes already taken into consideration. 
  IV. Relationship between the 4-percent limitand the 
mandates that can be acquiredthrough regional slates 
  1. The number of votes cast for regional slates nationwide 
shall be added up separately for each party (hereinafter: number 
of slate votes cast for a party). 
  2. Slate votes cast for all parties shall be added up 
(hereinafter: number of slate votes cast). 
  3. Four percent of the number of slate votes cast shall be 
calculated. 
  4. Any party receiving more slate votes than the four 
percent 
margin, shall receive the mandates acquired in the regional 
voting district, as well as mandates from the national slate, 
based on fractional votes. 
  5. Any party receiving fewer slate votes than the four 
percent margin shall 
  (a) lose the fractional votes acquired in the individual 
voting district, 
  (b) not acquire mandates from the regional voting district, 
and shall 
  (c) not acquire mandates from the national slate.

  Principles of the organization and functioningof the 
computerized information systemto be used in the 
elections 
  1. The computerized service shall be part of the working 
groups that function alongside the individual and regional 
district election boards, and the National Election Board. 
  2. The computerized service shall process only the data 
certified by the administrative board having jurisdiction. 
  3. Data added up by computers shall not be regarded as 
election results; determining whether such data represent 
election results, and publicizing such results shall be within 
the exclusive authority of the administrative board. 
  4. The administrative board may verify the functioning of 
computers and computer programs before the computer service 
begins its activity. 
  5. The administrative board may verify every aspect of the 
authenticity and credibility of the processed data, and the 
correctness of computations, but shall not provide directions as 
to the manner in which to perform the function. 
  6. A computer program shall be established for processing 
the 
data, on the basis of which any correction or change entered in 
the course of totaling the votes can be verified and identified 
subsequently. 
  7. After the election, based on the personal identification 
numbers of voters having cast votes, the computerized service 
shall prepare a record of voters who cast votes in two or more 
precincts, and shall present such record to the administrative 
boards. This means that the computerized service shall verify 
whether persons voting in their temporary residences cast votes 
in two or more precincts. 
  8. After making public the preliminary national results of 
the elections, and before announcing final results, the votes 
shall be totalled once again based on minutes maintained in 
precincts.

<H6>    LEGISLATIVE INTENT </H6>
  to the legislative proposal on theElection of 
National Assembly Representatives 
<H6>  GENERAL INTENT </H6>
  Our history, and close to 1,000 years of statehood have 
taught us that the Hungarian people always had a sincere desire 
to enforce their right and to perform their responsibility to 
direct and shape their own fortunes. After aspiring for freedom 
and independence for centuries, at the end of the 20th Century 
we once again have an opportunity to establish a constitutional 
state consistent with European concepts of freedom--a century 
that put to test individuals as well as nations. 
  The substance of suffrage and representation is the most 
sensitive issue from the standpoint of public law. Exercising 
the right to vote--a political right to which every citizen is 
entitled--is also the means for establishing a representative 
body. The provisions of an electoral law by which a 
representative body is created must not be based on arbitrary 
criteria. The standards contained in such law must be 
organically related to existing social conditions, and a true 
reflection of the relative strength of various political forces 
must be guaranteed. In addition to introducing the fundamental 
institutions of direct, democratic representation (popular 
referendums, popular initiatives, and so forth)--the subjects of 
unfair neglect in the past, to be used in a reasonable manner 
and with moderation under law in the future--secure foundations 
for governance will, undoubtedly, be established by the periodic 
renewal of representative bodies based on the people's will. 
This is a common characteristic of every modern, democratic, 
constitutional state. 
  At the present stage of our social development we must 
establish a system of political representation in which the 
policy-formulating influence and strength of political parties 
increases, in addition to having reliable and credible people, 
fit to perform the tasks. 
  The new electoral law is not simple, because it is adapted 
to 
the existing transitional and evolving social and political 
conditions. The Proposal provides for a mixed electoral system 
that aims for proportional representation, as a result of which 
176 representatives will be elected from individual voting 
districts, and 152 representative mandates will be acquired by 
parties based on votes cast for regional (county) slates of 
candidates. An additional 58 candidates will be chosen from 
national slates of candidates to compensate for disproportions 
resulting from votes cast for candidates running in individual 
voting districts or fielded on regional slates. The proposed law 
represents a departure from the mechanisms and institutions for 
nominating candidates used so far. It eliminates previous 
restrictions and establishes new legal criteria for nominating 
candidates. 
  Procedural rules guarantee the freedom and fairness of 
elections. From the standpoint of openness, the freedom to 
conduct election campaigns, and the availability of judicial 
recourse, the Proposal withstands any comparison. The Proposal 
guarantees rights to citizens, while it primarily prescribes 
duties for state agencies, organizations involved in the 
administration of the elections, and for the mass media: it 
assigns tasks to be performed by them to help citizens enforce 
their rights. 
  SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS 
  1. The Proposal preserves the traditional and 
democratic basic principles of elections: Suffrage is general 
and equal, and secret ballots are cast directly for candidates. 
  2. The Proposal provides a narrower definition of 
disenfranchised persons than before. The fact that 
disenfranchisement can only occur pursuant to law, based on the 
judgment of a court serves as a guarantee. 
  In a departure from legal provisions presently in force, the 
Proposal also provides a right to be elected: Any person with a 
permanent residence in Hungary and entitled to vote can also be 
elected. 
  The fact that Hungarian citizens staying abroad on election 
day, or whose permanent or temporary residence is not in 
Hungary, are regarded as impeded from the standpoint of casting 
votes, is a new element in the Proposal. This new provision is 
based on the fact that the Proposal views suffrage as a basic 
political right to which every Hungarian citizen is entitled, 
and regards persons staying abroad for long or short periods of 
time as impeded only insofar as the exercise of that right is 
concerned. 
  3. The eligible voters' free choice between 
exercising or not exercising the right to vote, as provided for 
by the Proposal, is significant as a matter of principle. This 
provision establishes an absolute opportunity for the exercise 
of the right to vote, but not a legal obligation to vote. 
  4. An extremely large variety of electoral 
procedures are used by various countries having multi-party 
systems. One finds examples for systems based purely on voting 
for slates of candidates, and others based exclusively on 
systems of individual voting districts, and yet others, in which 
the two systems are combined. At present, the appropriate system 
to be adopted in Hungary is one that combines slate voting 
linked to the various parties, and voting for candidates running 
in individual voting districts--a system in which every vote 
counts. 
  Consistent with the above, the Proposal provides for an 
electoral system that combines slate voting and voting for 
individual candidates, and different rules to be observed in 
electing representatives running or fielded in individual voting 
districts and in regional (county, Budapest) voting districts. 
About 60,000 residents elect a representative from each 
individual voting district. Voters may cast two votes, and 
receive two ballot forms to do so. One is used to cast a vote 
for a candidate running in the individual voting district, the 
other for casting a vote for one of the county (Budapest) slates 
of candidates fielded by the various parties. The winning 
candidate in an individual voting district receives a mandate. 
Votes cast in individual and regional voting districts 
nationwide, not materializing in individual or slate mandates, 
are added up, and 58 mandates are allocated to the national 
slates of parties in proportion to the aggregate number of 
"fractional votes" cast for each party. 
  As a result of this combined electoral system, 176 
representatives will be elected to serve in the National 
Assembly from individual voting districts, 152 representatives 
from regional voting districts, and 58 representatives from 
national slates of candidates. There will be a total of 386 
National Assembly representatives. 
  The legal status of each representative is equal; the way 
they acquire their mandates--from individual or regional voting 
districts, or from national slates--has no bearing on their 
status. 
  5. The method of nominating candidates for 
National Assembly representative varies according to the 
differences specified in Paragraph 4. Persons eligible to vote, 
and their social organizations qualifying under the law on the 
functioning and management of parties may, in their own right, 
nominate candidates to run in individual voting districts. Only 
persons eligible to vote may be nominated, and an additional 
condition requires that 750 nominating slips be collected from 
persons residing in the voting district and eligible to vote. 
Candidates nominated by eligible voters, or by social 
organizations which do not organize themselves as parties are 
called "independent candidates." 
  Parties may field candidates in regional voting districts 
only if they also field candidates in at least one-fourth the 
number of voting districts within the regional voting district, 
but in no event fewer than two voting districts. The intent of 
this provision is to prevent weightless, ad hoc groupings 
without grass roots support to play a role in Budapest or county 
public life. 
  Parties fielding at least seven regional slates may field 
candidates on national slates. 
  The Proposal enables parties to nominate the same person as 
a 
candidate in an individual voting district and a regional voting 
district, and, in addition, to list that person's name on the 
party's national slate. This enables parties to provide a 
greater chance to persons they regard as particularly important 
from their own standpoints. 
  6. Consistent with the new order of nomination, 
the Proposal conditions candidacy by a statement to be issued by 
the candidate, in addition to requirements established earlier 
in the Proposal (signatures of support, and the established 
ratio of candidates fielded). Candidates must issue statements 
attesting to the fact that they are eligible voters and that 
they accept the nomination, and must also state that they hold 
no office inconsistent with the representative mandate, and that 
they would resign such office, if elected. The Constitution 
specifies these conflict of interest rules. 
  Candidates conforming with these conditions are registered 
by 
election boards without further evaluation. The sole reason for 
which election boards can reject candidates is noncompliance 
with established legal criteria. 
  7.-9. Consistent with the logic applied to 
nominations, election results are also determined on the basis 
of different sets of rules. The fact that a certain proportion 
of eligible voters must cast votes for a representative to be 
elected is a common rule. In the first round of elections the 
criterion of validity is that more than half the number of 
eligible voters cast votes. Since greater public interest is 
attached to the allocation of a representative mandate than to 
holding a third or fourth round of elections, an auxiliary rule 
recognizes the votes of one-fourth the number of eligible voters 
as the validity criterion for a second round of elections. Two 
rounds of elections may be held in individual voting districts. 
A candidate running in an individual voting district acquires 
his mandate in the first round of elections, if he receives more 
than half the number of valid votes cast. The first round of 
elections is invalid if no candidate receives more than half the 
number of valid votes cast. Candidates receiving more than 15 
percent of the valid votes cast in the first round of elections 
may run in the second round of elections. Unless at least three 
persons receive 15 percent of the valid votes cast, the three 
candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the first 
round of elections may run in the second round of elections. The 
mandate is awarded in the second round of elections to the 
candidate receiving the highest number of votes. 
  Parties fielding regional slates of candidates receive 
mandates in proportion to the number of votes cast for their 
respective slates. Party candidates receive mandates in the 
sequence in which candidates have been announced by their 
respective parties, the exact number of such candidates 
depending on the proportion of votes cast for each party. The 
Appendix to this Law describes the exact method by which these 
proportions and the award of mandates are to be calculated; the 
method was specified in due regard to international experience 
and traditions followed in Hungary. In order to enforce the 
principle of majority rule, the Proposal establishes two 
barriers in the path of mandates to be acquired from slates. One 
is that mandates cannot be acquired with fewer votes than 
two-thirds the number of votes calculated and required for the 
acquisition of a mandate in any given regional voting district. 
[The other barrier:] Parties acquiring fewer than four percent 
of the votes cast for all the parties in a regional voting 
district cannot receive mandates either from their regional, or 
from their national slates of candidates. This solution ensures 
that National Assembly decisions are made solely by political 
forces that enjoy actual societal support. 
  Voters do not cast votes for the national slates of 
candidates; instead, parties receive mandates after the national 
aggregate number of fractional votes is known, pursuant to the 
method of calculation specified in the Appendix to this law. 
  10. The proposal provides great latitude in the 
election campaign for both voters and parties. It only prohibits 
the solicitation of nominating slips in places where such 
activity is regarded as unacceptable annoyance (in the patient 
care sections of health care institutions, on mass 
transportation vehicles), and where the influencing of voters is 
not desirable due to relationships of dependence, and therefore 
must be prohibited by law (workplaces, armed forces). 
  Signatures for nominating candidates must be provided on 
slips received by every registered voter, as part of a notice 
advising the voter that he is registered. If in doubt, the 
election board verifies the authenticity of signatures. 
  Eligible voters are free to organize election rallies, and 
such rallies are open to the public. The organizer of a rally is 
responsible for maintaining order. 
  11.-12. To ensure equal chances for every party, 
the Proposal provides for the mass media (Hungarian Radio, 
Hungarian Press, Hungarian Telegraphic Office [MTI] to 
participate in the election campaign. 
  To ensure an atmosphere in which the free expression of the 
voters' will is not influenced during the period immediately 
preceding election day, and on election day, the Proposal 
restricts the publication of public opinion poll results, and 
prohibits campaigning beginning at 0000 hours the day before the 
elections. 
  13. As part of the rules governing the election 
campaign, the Proposal provides for the preparation of wall 
posters, advertisements, signs and pamphlets. Such campaign 
material may be prepared without special permit. The Proposal 
restricts the placement and posting of posters only to protect 
public and private interests. These include: the placement of 
posters on building walls and fences only with the building 
owner's or manager's permission. 
  Local councils may define by ordinance public buildings and 
parts of public areas where the placement of election 
advertisements and wall posters is prohibited in order to 
protect the appearance of a city, historical places, the 
environment, or interests related to foreign tourism. 
  14.-18. Detailed rules concerning the method of 
voting have not undergone fundamental changes, but are 
supplemented by stronger guarantees to ensure the fairness of 
elections. A new provision includes the requirement that polling 
places cannot be established in buildings exclusively used by 
one or another political party; that pens, rather than pencils 
be used to mark ballot forms; and that the first person casting 
a vote at a polling place must also check the ballot boxes. 
  Consistent with rules now in force, the chairman of the 
returning board is responsible for maintaining order at the 
polling place and its vicinity, and the policeman on duty at the 
polling place may enter the polling place only with the 
permission of the chairman of the returning board. 
  19. Consistent with the electoral system 
characterized by two votes to be cast, separate ballot forms are 
provided for voting for individual district candidates, and for 
regional slates, respectively. 
  20. The method of voting differs from the practice 
followed thus far. The earlier negative voting (crossing out the 
name of a candidate not desired) is replaced by positive voting: 
A "+" mark must be placed in the box on the ballot form next to 
the candidate's and the party's name. Votes can only be cast for 
candidates and parties appearing on the ballot form, by 
designating the candidate and the party slate for whom the voter 
casts his vote. Parties establish fixed slates, i.e., voters can 
cast their votes only for the slate as a whole. Therefore, with 
respect to an otherwise valid vote (in which the official ballot 
form is used and it is clear for which party slate the vote is 
cast), changes made in the sequence of the candidates within a 
slate, deletions from, or additions to the slate must be 
disregarded. Such votes must be regarded as valid votes cast for 
a given party slate. 
  21.-25. The Proposal does not change the rules 
for, and the traditional order of the voting process, with which 
people are familiar. The proposal introduces only a few 
supplemental rules that strengthen the societal openness of the 
elections. These include a requirement that a copy of the 
minutes containing the election results be deposited to the 
archives in the area of jurisdiction, and that ballots cast be 
preserved until the final settlement of possible pending 
judicial proceedings challenging the election results. 
  26.-34. The establishment and composition of 
administrative boards involved in the elections are consistent 
with practices based on the principle of having [several] 
parties. Notably: every party that fields a candidate and the 
representative of every independent candidate is, by law, a 
member of the relevant administrative board. 
  The chairmen and secretaries of administrative boards are 
impartial; neither of these officials can be members of a party 
fielding candidates, nor can they be representatives of an 
independent candidate. A fixed number of members in each 
administrative body is chosen either by the National Assembly, 
or by councils. Elective and delegated members of administrative 
bodies have equal rights and duties. 
  35. Working groups without any decision-making 
authority assist in the functioning of the administrative 
bodies. These groups perform administrative, technical, and 
organizing functions. Members of the working group take an oath 
to unconditionally uphold legality. 
  36.-39. The method of forming precincts remains 
unchanged as compared to rules presently in force. 
  The State Census Bureau continues to prepare the register of 
voters. 
  The manner in which the register is compiled, the display of 
the register for public inspection, and rules for legal recourse 
against the illegal exclusion or inclusion of a voter have not 
changed. 
  40. The proposal retains previous provisions 
permitting people to vote with certificates, but includes 
additional safeguards to prevent possible abuse of this 
opportunity. Certificates must be preserved as part of the 
election documents, so that in case of doubt--e.g. in court 
proceedings--the validity of votes cast based on certificates 
may be proven in a credible manner. 
  41. Openness plays a definitive role in ensuring 
the fairness of elections. Accordingly, provisions to the effect 
that actions and operations of administrative boards are matters 
of public record, and that data and facts available to 
administrative boards cannot be classified as secrets, reflect 
adherence to significant principles. 
  The populace must be informed of every fact, deadline, or 
information related to the elections and of interest to the 
public. 
  Members of the press need no separate permit to observe the 
workings of the administrative boards, and therefore the 
Proposal lifts constraints that existed earlier. 
  Only one restriction exists, notably: on election day, in 
order to safeguard the fairness of the elections: partial 
election results must not be made public prior to 2000 hours, 
i.e., the final hour when polls close according to the law. 
  The amount of funds available to candidates and to parties 
for the campaign, and the kinds of funds they use for various 
purposes is of public concern, and therefore is also part of 
openness. For this reason, these data must be publicized by the 
press. 
  42.-45. From the standpoint of ensuring the 
legality of elections and of protecting the exercise of 
fundamental political rights, provisions pertaining to judicial 
recourse, as contained in the Proposal, are of outstanding 
importance. 
  The basic feature of the system of legal recourse is that 
the 
administrative boards provide first instance remedies to actions 
objected to. The aggrieved party may turn to the courts, if an 
administrative board rejects an objection. A one-step court 
proceeding not subject to appeal is provided for. 
  46. Special elections must be held in both 
individual and regional voting districts, if the second round of 
an election is also invalid because fewer than one-quarter the 
number of eligible voters participated, or because the election 
could not be held in lack of a candidate or a slate. 
  Special elections must be held in individual voting 
districts 
only when the mandate of a representative expires. (Criteria for 
such expiration are detailed in the Constitution.) Mandates 
vacated by representatives elected from regional or national 
slates may be disposed of by the party that established the 
slate. The party that established the slate may designate any 
representative from the slate to fill the vacated mandate. The 
sole condition established in this regard is that the party 
select a person announced by the party to be included in the 
slate at the time of the general elections; the sequence of the 
candidates on the slate may be disregarded. 
  Even though special elections could also produce fractional 
votes, special election results have no effect on mandates 
allocated from the national slate. 
  47. The temporary exemption from under regular or 
reserve military duty, and the free of charge access to public 
transportation enjoyed by candidates are intended to provide 
opportunities for the candidates' real participation in the 
election campaign. 
  48. Based on a new feature in the elections--the 
use of computer technology--which increases openness and permits 
faster communications to the public, the Proposal distinguishes 
between preliminary and final election results. Preliminary 
results are published in daily newspaper, while final results 
appear in MAGYAR KOZLONY. 
  49. Rules pertaining to the calling of elections 
are contained in the Constitution; the electoral law has to 
settle only the duration of the election proceedings. This 
remains unchanged: the duration is 90 days. 
  50.-51. The National Assembly appropriates funds 
to cover the cost of state functions related to the elections. 
  Budgeted funds must be used to finance the expenditures of 
the state on the one hand, and the costs incurred by the various 
parties participating in the elections, on the other. The latter 
must be financed in order to ensure equal opportunity for all 
parties to win. The Proposal establishes standard amounts of 
support for the various parties: they receive state 
contributions in proportion to the candidates fielded. 
Independent candidates are entitled to the same amount of 
support as candidates nominated by parties. 
  53. Consistent with his changed role, the minister 
of the interior directs the state functions related to the 
preparation and implementation of elections. 
  54. The proposal continues to exempt proceedings 
related to the elections and to the entitlement to vote from 
under payment of official dues. 
  55. The Legislative Law requires that all laws be 
in mutual harmony from the standpoint of both content and form. 
It would be appropriate to place provisions of this law 
referring to election rallies under the authority of the Law on 
the Right to Assemble, and the text of the law must be changed 
accordingly. 
  56. The Proposal provides that the Law take effect 
on the day of its proclamation. Following the effective date, 
provisions of Law No. 3 of 1983 must still be applied insofar as 
the election of council members is concerned.

slips in the form of a closed, sealed bundle, in a secure place. 
The election board shall notify the nominee or his

decision, and shall open the closed bundle, and perform possible 
certification in the presence of the nominee or his 
representative. 
  ``6.6. Unless the election board of an individual 
voting district receives a challenge to a nomination, it shall 
destroy the nominating slips on election day, in the presence of 
the nominee or his representative. 
  ``6.7. If an objection is raised, or legal recourse is 
sought against the decision of an individual voting district 
election board, or if legal recourse is sought against the 
decision rendered by the National Election Board, the nominating 
slips may be transferred to an administrative organ or court

objection. After a final judgment is reached regarding an 
objection or petition for legal recourse, these nominating slips

  ``6.8. Election boards shall make provisions to deny 
access by unauthorized persons to the nominating slips during 
the time period beginning with the receipt of nomination slips,

election of National Assembly Representatives; adopted on 4 July 
1990 by the National Assembly. The following includes the 
amended or added provisions, with deletions from the 1989 law 
appearing between slashes /.../, and new provisions, or changes 
in existing provisions in bold italics.] 
  [Text] 
  1. The following provisions shall replace 
Paragraphs 30.1. and 30.2 of Law No. 34 of 1989 on the election 
of National Assembly representatives, as amended by Law No. 2 of 
1990: 
  ``30.1. Local councils or [local council] executive 
committees shall elect the secretaries and two members of 
returning boards, based on proposals submitted by council 
executive committee secretaries, in due regard to persons 
suggested by the various parties. In every local jurisdiction, 
each party fielding candidates, and each independent candidate 
running in the elections shall designate one additional member 
to serve on the returning board. Several parties and independent 
candidates may jointly designate members to serve on returning 
boards. If in any local jurisdiction the parties and independent 
candidates designate only one or two persons to serve on the 
returning board, the local council or the executive 
committee shall elect three or four additional persons to 
serve on the returning board, so that the returning board is 
composed of five members. 
  ``30.2. The municipal council of Budapest, and the councils 
of various counties, or the executive committees of these 
councils shall elect the secretaries and two members of 
individual and regional voting district election boards, based 
on proposals submitted by the respective council executive 
committee secretaries, in due regard to recommendations made by 
the various parties. In every jurisdiction, each party fielding 
candidates, and each independent candidate running in the 
elections shall designate one additional member to the election 
boards. If in any jurisdiction the parties and independent 
candidates designate only one or two persons to serve on an 
election board, the local council or its executive 
committee shall elect three or four additional persons, so 
that the election board is composed of five members. 
  2. The following provisions shall replace 
Paragraphs 53.1. and 53.2: 
  ``53.1. The minister of the interior shall direct the 
organizing and technical implementation of state functions 
related to the elections, and the activities of 
working groups operating alongside the administrative boards /, 
as well as the computerized vote tallying system./ The minister 
of the interior shall present a report concerning these 
activities at a [plenary] session of the National Assembly. 
  ``53.2. Deadlines, and starting and ending dates specified 
in 
this Law shall be expressed in terms of calendar dates, 
and the order of tallying votes shall be provided in the 
form of a decree promulgated by the minister of the interior, 
and published by the press.'' 
  3. This law shall take effect upon its 
proclamation. 
  [In lieu of signatures] Dr. Arpad Goncz, president 
of the Republic; Gyorgy Szabad, acting president 
of the National Assembly 
<H6>  LEGISLATIVE INTENT </H6>
  1. The expeditious administration of elections 
within the constraints of legality demands that the number of 
members of the administrative boards involved in the elections 
(returning boards, individual and regional voting district 
election boards) amounts to at least the minimum number of 
members required by law. The mandates of members of 
administrative boards could cease for various reasons, and this 
could hinder the functioning of administrative boards in the 
course of elections. The law provides for the replacement of 
members who have dropped out, only on the basis of decisions by 
council bodies. Council bodies generally hold meetings once 
every three months. For this reason it is appropriate to also 
authorize council executive committees to supplement the 
membership of administrative boards, because council executive 
committees meet more frequently. 
  2. The computerized vote tallying system is an 
extremely costly method to tally votes. For this reason it is 
appropriate to provide a simpler method for the tallying of 
small volumes of data. Therefore, it is appropriate to authorize 
the minister of the interior to decree--immediately before the 
elections--the order for tallying votes. The decree must be 
publicized in the press.

established deadlines for legal recourse. The personal data and 
address record keeping organ shall not adopt data resulting from 
such links for its [regular] personal data and address records."

various /parties/ slates appear on the ballot form. 
  ``8.9. /Special elections shall be held in a regional voting 
district (Paragraph 46.) if lacking party slates, no first or

<H6>  Appendix 4to Law No. 3 of 1994(Paragraph 52.d.) </H6>
  Method of calculation for tallying votes and 
for determining the outcome of elections 
  I. Individual voting district 
  1. Valid and invalid round of election: 
  (a) Valid first round of election 
  A first round of election is valid if more than half the 
number of eligible voters cast votes 
  (b) Invalid first round of election 
  A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or 
fewer eligible voters cast votes. 
  (c) Valid second round of election 
  A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful 
first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is valid if more 
than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. 
  (d) Invalid second round of election 
  A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful 
first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is invalid if fewer 
than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes. 
  2. Successful or unsuccessful round of election: 
  (a) Successful first round of election 
  A valid first round of election is successful (Point 1/a) if 
a candidate receive more than half the number of votes cast. 
  (b) Unsuccessful first round of election 
  A valid first round of election is unsuccessful (Point 1/a) 
if no candidate receives more than half the number of votes cast. 
  (c) Successful second round of election 
  A valid second round of election after a valid (Point 1/a) 
or 
invalid (Point 1/b) first round of election is successful if the 
votes cast for the various candidates differ. 
  (d) Unsuccessful second round of election 
  A valid second round of election (Point 1/c) is unsuccessful 
if the candidates received equal numbers of votes. 
  In individual voting districts the candidate receiving in 
the 
valid round of election the number of votes specified in Points 
2/a or 2/c shall become the National Assembly representative. 
  II. Regional voting district 
  1. Valid and invalid round of election: 
  (a) Valid /first/ round of election 
  A first round of election is valid if more than half the 
number of eligible voters cast votes. 
  (b) Invalid /first/ round of election 
  A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or 
fewer eligible voters cast votes. 
  (c) Valid second round of election 
  A second round of election after an invalid first round of 
election (Point 1/b) is valid if more than one-fourth the number 
of eligible voters cast votes. 
  (d) Invalid second round of election 
  A second round of election after an invalid first round of 
election (Point 1/b) is invalid if one-fourth the number of 
eligible voters or fewer eligible voters cast votes. 
  2. Preconditions for calculating the outcome of regional 
slate election results: 
  (a) national tally of votes cast for regional slates, 
separately per party; 
  (b) identification of parties whose national vote total does 
not exceed the /4-percent/ margin established in Paragraph 8.5. 
of the Law. 
  3. Calculating results in a valid round of elections held in 
a regional voting district: 
  (a) The number of votes cast for the various parties' 
electoral slates shall be added up (hereinafter: the total 
number of valid votes). 
  (b) One additional mandate shall be added to the number of 
mandates that can be obtained in a voting district (hereinafter: 
divider). 
  (c) The total number of valid votes shall be divided by the 
divider. The quotient thus derived represents the number of 
votes needed to acquire a mandate. 
  (d) The number representing two-thirds of the number of 
votes 
needed to acquire a mandate shall be calculated (hereinafter: 
two-thirds limit). 
  (e) The number of votes cast for a given party slate shall 
be 
divided by the number of votes required to acquire a mandate. 
The whole number derived as a result of the division equals the 
number of mandates acquired by the /party/ parties, 
in due regard to the provisions of Paragraph 8.8 of the Law. The 
remainder after the division, as well as votes not resulting in 
mandates constitute fractional votes. 
  (f) If, after the division pursuant to Point (e) there 
remains an unallocated mandate, parties receive mandates in the 
declining order of fractional votes cast for parties, up to the 
two-thirds limit. If all mandates are distributed in a given 
voting district, no additional mandates can be distributed, 
irrespective of the two-thirds limit. Except for fractional 
votes defined in Paragraph 8.4. of the Law, fractional votes not 
resulting in mandates shall be added to the national slate. 
  (g) After completing the calculation specified in Point (f), 
above, in a regional voting district, the still unallocated 
mandates shall be added to the national slate. 
  III. Distribution of mandates that can be acquired 
from national slates based on fractional votes 
  1. Fractional votes resulting in individual and regional 
voting districts (Paragraphs 9.1. /Subsections a. and b./) shall 
be added up on a nationwide basis separately for each party, in 
due regard to the provisions of Paragraph 8.4. of the Law 
(hereinafter: total number of fractional votes cast for a party). 
  2. The number of fractional votes cast for all the parties 
throughout the country shall be a added up (hereinafter: 
national fractional vote). 
  3. The number of mandates not allocated from regional slates 
(Point II/3/g) shall be added to the maximum number of mandates 
that can be acquired from the national slate (58). 
  4. /The national aggregate number of fractional votes shall 
be divided by the number of unallocated mandates per Point 3 
above. The resultant quotient shall represent the number of 
votes required to allocate a mandate./ The mandates to be 
obtained from the national slate shall be distributed based on 
the fractional votes. The process of accomplishing this is as 
follows: A table must be prepared, whose first line shows the 
fractional votes cast for the various parties. Below each 
party's fractional votes columns of numbers must be drawn, in 
which the first number is half the number of fractional votes 
allocated to a given party, the next number is one-third, 
one-fourth, etc., of that number. 
  5. /The number of fractional votes cast for any given party 
shall be divided by the number of votes required for the 
allocation of a mandate. The whole number quotient derived as a 
result of the division shall represent the number of mandates to 
be allocated to any given party. Fractions and fractional votes 
not resulting in mandates shall be the repeat fractional votes 
(hereinafter: repeat fractional votes)./ Mandates must be 
distributed with the help of this table. The largest number 
occurring on the table must be found. The party in whose column 
of numbers the largest number is found, receives one mandate. 
Thereafter the next largest number must be found. The party in 
whose column of numbers that number is found, receives another 
mandate. This process must be continued until all mandates are 
distributed. 
  If, in the course of searching for the largest number 
occurring in the table identical numbers are found, the decision 
as to which party receives the mandate must be determined 
pursuant to Paragraph 8.8 of the Law. 
  /6. If after the division specified in Point 5 above there 
remains an unallocated mandate, the number of repeat fractional 
votes shall be divided by the number of unallocated mandates. 
This calculation produces the number of votes required for 
allocating one mandate. The allocation of mandates shall be 
continued based on the new quotient and on repeat fractional 
votes in a declining order, until the number of mandates shown 
in Point 3 above are allocated./ 
  /7. If, after completing the calculation pursuant to Point 6 
above, there remain unallocated mandates, the calculation shall 
be repeated after deducting the already allocated mandates and 
the number of votes already taken into consideration./ 
  IV. Relationship between the /four percent/ 
percentage limit and the mandates that can be 
acquired through regional slates: 
  1. The number of votes cast for regional slates nationwide 
shall be added up separately for each party (hereinafter: number 
of slate votes cast for a party). 
  2. Slate votes cast for all parties shall be added up 
(hereinafter: number of slate votes cast). 
  3. /Four percent/ The percentage pursuant to Paragraph 
8.5. of the number of party slate votes cast 
shall be calculated. 
  4. Any party receiving more slate votes than the /four 
percent margin/ percentage specified in Paragraph 
8.5., shall receive the mandates acquired in the regional 
voting district, as well as mandates from the national slate, 
based on fractional votes. 
  5. Any party receiving fewer slate votes than the /four 
percent margin/ percentage specified in Paragraph 
8.5. shall 
  (a) lose the fractional votes acquired in the individual 
voting district, 
  (b) not acquire mandates from the regional voting district, 
and shall 
  (c) not acquire mandates from the national slate.

<F P=106> [Amendment to the Constitution of the Hungarian Republic: </F>
"Law CVII of the year 1993 concerning amendment of the 
Constitution"; passed by the National Assembly on 7 Dec 1993] 
  [Text] The National Assembly lays down the following law 
amending Law XX of the year 1949, which pertains to the 
Constitution of the Hungarian Republic: 
  Article 1. The following Article 19/E is added to the 
Constitution: 
  ``Article 19/E. (1) In order to repulse the attack in the 
event that external armed groups unexpectedly intrude into 
Hungary's territory, or to defend the country's territory with 
the Hungarian Army's air defense and flight-ready forces, the 
Government is required to act immediately to protect the 
citizens' life and property, public order, and public safety in 
accordance with the defense plan signed by the president of the 
Republic--using forces that are commensurate with the attack and 
prepared for this purpose--until a decision has been made about 
declaring a state of emergency or extraordinary situation. 
  ``(2) In the interest of taking further measures, the 
Government will inform the National Assembly and the president 
of the Republic without delay of the measures it took on the 
basis of paragraph (1). 
  "(3) The vote of two-thirds of the National Assembly 
representatives present is necessary to pass the law that 
outlines the regulations pertaining to the Government's 
immediate measures." 
  Article 2. The following provision replaces Article 40/A of 
the Constitution: 
  ``Article 40/A. (1) The basic duty of the armed forces (the 
Hungarian Army and the Border Guard) is the military defense of 
the homeland. The Border Guard's policing area of 
responsibility is guarding the state's borders, supervising 
border traffic, and maintaining order along the borders. The 
vote of two-thirds of the National Assembly representatives 
present is necessary to pass the law concerning the tasks of the 
armed forces and the detailed regulations that pertain to them. 
  ``(2) The basic task of the police force is protecting 
public 
safety and domestic order. The vote of two-thirds of the 
National Assembly representatives present is necessary to pass 
the law concerning the detailed regulations dealing with the 
police and with national security activities.'' 
  Article 3. In Article 40/B of the Constitution, paragraph 
(4) 
is replaced by the following provision, and the following new 
paragraph (5) is added: 
  ``(4) Members of the armed forces, the police, and the civil 
national security services who have a professional status may 
not be members of a party and may not engage in political 
activities. 
  ``(5) A law passed with the vote of two-thirds of the 
National Assembly representatives present can establish 
limitations on the party activities of members of the armed 
forces who do not have professional military status.'' 
  Article 4. This law goes into force on the eighth day after 
its publication. 
  [Signed] Arpad Goncz, president of the Republic; Gyorgy 
Szabad, president of the National Assembly

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Frydl and Kveta Subertova: "Mutual Trade </F>
Between Czech Republic and United States Is Increasing, but 
Czech Republic Shows Considerable Deficit"] 
  [Text] Bill Clinton will arrive in Prague today. It is only 
the second time in the history of the Czechoslovak state and the 
first time during the existence of the independent Czech state 
that a president of the United States has payed us a visit. 
Although this visit has above all a political content, according 
to Friday's statement by a senior White House official, it will 
play an important part in the negotiations in the capital of the 
Czech Republic [CR] and in improving the access of Eastern 
European countries to Western markets. Although the President is 
not bringing any concrete proposals, and understands that this 
is a problem for which there are no easy answers, he wants to 
contribute to its solution. 
  The basic document which regulates economic relations 
between 
CR and the United States is the 1990 Agreement on Trade 
Relations, which gives CR a favored nation status. In 1991 the 
U.S. Government also accorded CSFR the preferential customs 
system which applies to developing countries, and which was 
extended for CR until 30 September 1994. Mutual relations are 
also regulated by, among other things, the Agreement on Support 
and Protection of Investments of 1991 and the Agreement for 
Preventing Double Taxation (ratified on 23 December 1993). 
  Trade between CR and the United States shows a considerable 
dynamic, our newspaper was told in this connection by the 
director of the Department for OECD countries of the CR Ministry 
of Industry and Trade, Petr Postulka. In 1992 trade turnover 
grew by 176 percent, and reached a volume of $684 million. At 
the same time, however, the trade deficit on the Czech side 
climbed to $375 million. This happened because the imports ($529 
million) included the purchase of aircraft for the Czechoslovak 
Airlines. Overall, United States is in the 10th place among the 
CR trade partners. In the first 11 months of 1993, the share of 
the United States in our foreign trade reached 2.4 percent. 
Exports to the United States amount to 1.8 percent of CR exports 
and U.S. exports to CR amount to 2.9 percent of CR imports. The 
deficit in the mutual balance of trade from January to November 
1993 reached $137 million of the total trade turnover of $522 
million. If we disregard the one-time impact of the purchase of 
the aircraft in 1992, it appears that the CR deficit still 
continues to increase, said Petr Postulka. 
  In the structure of Czech exports to the United States the 
largest share is that of textiles (about 18 percent), glass (13 
percent), and rolled steel (9.5 percent). According to Postulka, 
it would be helpful to the Czech economy if machine tools played 
a bigger part on the U.S. market, since consumer goods will have 
to face an increasingly stronger competition, especially from 
the developing countries. More than a quarter of the imports to 
CR consists of computer technology, followed by electrical 
conductors (7 percent), and telecommunication equipment (6 
percent). CR therefore imports high technology goods which serve 
to modernize the Czech economy and strengthen its 
competitiveness. 
  The regulations for protecting the Czech market are liberal, 
but the access of Czech goods to the U.S. market is in some 
cases encumbered by high tariffs (for example, footware, glass). 
On the other hand, for the time being Czech exporters can use 
the system of general customs preferences for some commodities. 
U.S. quotas are basically sufficient for them, and there is even 
the question whether, for example, the newly established quota 
for 800 tons of cheese will be fully used up this year, said 
director Postulka. Apart from cheese, United States sets quotas 
only for the import of woolen piece goods and ready-made 
clothing. The agreement on voluntary restriction of the export 
of steel from CSFR has not been renewed after its expiration on 
31 March 1992.

<F P=106> [Article by vac: "Last Year, the Czech Republic Balance of </F>
Trade Ended Up With a Surplus of 5.9 Billion Korunas--Exports 
Last Year Rose by One-Fifth"] 
  [Text] Prague (vac)--Last year, the balance of trade 
achieved a surplus of 5.9 billion korunas [Kc]. This is evident 
from the preliminary results of the Czech Statistical Office. 
Total exports for 1993 rose to Kc372.3 billion (approximately 
two-fifths of the gross domestic product), while imports 
amounted to Kc366.4 billion. Slovakia accounted for virtually 19 
percent of the overall volume of foreign trade; countries with 
developed market economies accounted for 58 percent. The 
remainder is accounted for by developing countries and the 
countries of the former Eastern bloc. 
  The Czech Republic achieved a positive balance of trade with 
the countries of the European Union (Kc7.5 billion), developing 
countries (Kc13.6 billion), European countries whose economies 
are in transition, excluding the former USSR (Kc8.4 billion), 
countries having a system of state trade (Kc6.4 billion), and 
Slovakia (Kc9.6 billion). The balance of trade involving 
countries of EFTA [European Free Trade Association] was on the 
negative side (Kc12 billion), as was the balance involving the 
remaining developed nations with market economies (Kc7.7 
billion) and trade involving the countries of the former USSR 
(Kc19.8 billion). 
  A significant increase developed in exports (excluding 
exports to the Slovak Republic because data for 1992 do not 
exist), which amounted to a 20-percent rise in comparison with 
1992. Imports for last year, compared to the previous year, rose 
by only 2.7 percent. Excluding the Slovak Republic, the balance 
of trade remained on the negative side to the extent of Kc3.7 
billion, although the current account of the balance of payments 
in convertible currencies was specifically on the positive side 
last year; for just 11 months of 1993, it amounted to $637 
million--that is, approximately Kc18.5 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Plzak: "Chemopetrol Is Transforming </F>
Hitherto Undesirable Waste Material Into a Suitably Usable 
Export Raw Material--The New Substance Is Used in Eliminating 
Oil Disasters and in Purifying Water"] 
  [Text] The chemical plant at Litvinov has verified a 
technology for the production of a practically usable chemical 
substance from a raw material that has hitherto been an 
undesirable waste material. Waters contaminated with black 
carbon, which were a threat to the environment, are now being 
processed into superconductive channel black. This is a product 
with outstanding absorption characteristics, which has become an 
export item. Among other uses, the material can be used in the 
elimination of oil disasters and in the purification of 
wastewaters. Its advantage is that it is more effective than 
other sorbents and costs less. It has a smaller mass, which 
reduces the cost of transportation. Currently, it is being 
tested in the United States, South America, Norway, France, and 
other countries. Maritime interests in the United States have 
used it to wash out the holds of tankers. 
  The Chemopetrol Enterprise has shown flexibility in 
developing new sorbents. In one month, it changed the 
consistency of the material from a powder to granules. It thus 
eliminated dustiness, which was bothering potential users. 
Furthermore, the enterprise introduced packaging in smaller 
quantities, which facilitates manipulation and use. 
  Work on the project was participated in by a Swiss 
commercial 
firm that was instrumental in expanding the circle of customers. 
In Argentina, sorbents are being readied to eliminate the 
lagoons that accompany petroleum drilling. Ivory Coast has also 
indicated an interest in the product. The cost of using the 
material in individual countries is being defrayed by the Swiss 
firm, without requiring financial participation on the part of 
Chemopetrol. 
  Along with superconductive channel black, Chemopetrol 
introduced a new wastewater purification plant onto the market. 
Thanks to the new sorbents, the efficiency of this plant is 
exceedingly high. The first customer for this plant was the 
largest Swiss liquid waste incinerator near Geneva. With the aid 
of the technology from Litvinov, this facility will be able to 
do away with two-phase cleaning and will be able to release 
wastewater into the river following the first passage through 
the purification facility. After introduction into series 
production, the purification facility will cost 400,000 korunas, 
which is approximately one-third of the cost of existing devices 
with a similar capacity.

<F P=106> [Article by Sophia Coudenhove: "A Ministerial Surprise"] </F>
  [Text] Journalists applauded as an earnest and soft-spoken 
Pavel Tigrid entered his first press conference as minister of 
culture. But the first thing the 76-year-old told them was that, 
as a former newspaper columnist, he'd rather be sitting on their 
side of the table. 
  "I hesitated a lot," he said, adding that he had always been 
of the opinion that today the country should be governed by the 
young. 
  Nevertheless, Tigrid returned from Paris after almost 46 
years of living abroad in time to start his new post at the 
ministry, Jan. 24. Since November 1989 he has made frequent 
visits back to Prague and served as chief advisor to President 
Vaclav Havel from 1990-1992. 
  While Tigrid's appointment as minister of culture was almost 
universally welcomed, it surprised artists and politicians 
alike. In nominating Tigrid, the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czech Peoples' Party (KDU-CSL) gave up their right to 
nominate someone from their own ranks for the post. 
  Party chairman Josef Lux said Tigrid, who is not a member of 
any party, was chosen for his skills and not for his politics. 
  "We absolutely respect the fact that the minister is not a 
member of any political party," Lux said. "We feel a closeness 
in our life philosophies and we perceive a closeness of opinion 
on basic political questions and on the world around us. This is 
more important than a [party] membership card." 
  The appointment is also unusual because, Tigrid is one of 
the 
few emigres to attain an important position in post revolution 
governments. But unlike many others, he has always been 
intimately involved in Czech politics and culture. A regular 
columnist for the Czech daily LIDOVE NOVINY and commentator for 
Radio Free Europe, he also founded the emigre quarterly 
Testimony, which under Communism was smuggled from Paris to 
Czechoslovakia. 
  But to Havel and many others, Tigrid's contribution to his 
country went much further. 
  "It has to be said that [Tigrid's] impact in exile was not 
just that he once ran Radio Free Europe and then published 
Testimony," Havel said on his weekly radio broadcast, Jan. 23. 
"His role was much broader. He was a vital integrating 
personality and a center of political and spiritual life in 
exile." 
  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus also said the government 
supports 
Tigrid and sees him as a capable manager able to handle 
administration and to communicate with the public. He praised 
the new minister for his ability to work in several different 
fields at once, without limiting himself to one particular area. 
  While Havel also gave Tigrid his full support, he denied 
speculations that Tigrid would merely be a mouthpiece to the 
castle. 
  "Pavel Tigrid, who is loyal to the government, is loyal to 
the president because he is loyal to the state," Havel said. 
"But he is a man who has his own judgment and a man who cannot 
be manipulated." 
  Tigrid's predecessor, Jindrich Kabat, resigned Jan. 17, 
allegedly for personal reasons. He also said he was frustrated 
at tension in the government. 
  Klaus, however, said he did not believe these were the real 
reasons for Kabat's resignation. "A resignation is never a 
one-sided act," he said. "It's always two-sided and then 
sometimes from the outside the one-sided argumentation can be 
emphasized more." Many had expected Kabat to resign following 
widespread accusations of inefficiency. (see related article, 
page 2a [not reproduced here]). 
  As the reins of power are shifted from intellectuals to 
technocrats, Tigrid and Interior Minister Jan Ruml are the only 
former dissident ministers in the Czech Republic. 
  Promising that his aim as minister would be to serve and to 
listen, Tigrid also pledged maximum honesty to the press. 
  "This ministry will be transparent and it will be 
penetrable," he said, "that means I won't scheme and I won't lie 
much, even though sometimes that absolutely has to be. I think 
the ministry of culture shouldn't have any secrets whatsoever."

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Jozsef Kaproczay, parliamentary </F>
representative of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Attila 
Nagy; place and date not given: "Is the MDF's Popularity 
Growing?"] 
  [Text] Ference Kulin, parliamentary group leader of 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), recently said at one of 
his regular Friday news conferences that during the past few 
months the MDF's popularity has increased, especially in the 
provinces. What is the opinion of Jozsef Kaproczay, 
parliamentary representative from Szigetvar? 
  [Kaproczay] Before answering this question, I have to tell 
you that my electoral district includes 71 local governments and 
85 topographically distinct areas. There are numerous very 
small settlements, with 50 villages having fewer than 500 
inhabitants. Szigetvar's three large enterprises--the canning 
and shoe factories, and the state farm--are in an unbelievably 
difficult situation; I mention this because of the unemployment 
situation that has developed, which obviously has an impact on 
the so-called agglomerated districts as well as on agricultural 
production. In spite of this, as I go around among my electors, 
I have the feeling--and I am trying to formulate this 
cautiously--that we have moved from the low point of 
unpopularity. 
  [Nagy] What do you think is the reason for this? 
  [Kaproczay] Perhaps first is the farmers' circles movement, 
which is increasingly "on solid ground." Thank God, in our area 
during the past few months such farmers' circles have been 
formed in five or six settlements. The preferential 
machinery-purchasing drive also has had a very good effect on 
the people who live in villages, especially in South Baranya 
county, where conditions are more favorable for agriculture. I 
should note, however, that as far as I know, this drive has 2 
billion forints at its disposal; it would be a very great 
mistake if it would not be possible to continually "replenish" 
this sum. It would cause tremendous disappointment. Thus I can 
say unequivocally that something has started to move. At the 
same time, I must emphasize that people are interested in 
knowing what is going on and they are starting to notice that 
many things have happened in this country during the past four 
years. 
  [Nagy] Do you think the media had a role in this? 
  [Kaproczay] Undoubtedly, although this is precisely what 
prominent members of the opposition parties object to. I 
personally object strenuously to the suggestion that this is 
similar to the rosy propaganda of the last part of the Kadar 
era.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "KDNP Experts Attack Lajos Csepi"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The economic committee of the KDNP [Christian 
Democratic People's Party] urges that immediate measures be 
taken in connection with privatization so that "it will be 
possible to at least reduce the national political and economic 
harm that stems from it." The document, which was treated as 
confidential and was put together by prominent Christian 
Democratic economists and financial experts, clearly states in 
its recommendation that "the KDNP should announce officially 
that it protests the fact that Lajos Csepi has been named 
director of the AV Rt. [State Property Management Corporation] 
and attempts to merge the AVU [State Property Agency] with the 
AV Rt., and it should demand that the organizational system 
remain unchanged until the election. It should also protest the 
planned firing of personnel at the AV Rt. and, finally, carrying 
out any privatization that goes beyond what was originally 
planned." [passage omitted] 
  The KDNP economic committee's announcement, which was 
expressed in 17 points, clearly states: "We can say 
unequivocally that the privatization question has been handled 
badly by the coalition and that this will be one of its greatest 
burdens in the election. This burden is made even greater by 
the personnel changes that have taken place recently: the firing 
of Szabolcs Szekeres and the naming of Lajos Csepi to take his 
place." [passage omitted] 
  According the the Christian Democrats, a drive led by the 
SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] lurks in the background of 
the government's move. [passage omitted] 
  Analyzing the "activities" of Lajos Csepi, the Christian 
Democrats emphasize that he immediately set about making 
personnel changes that reflected his own taste; he started 
firing AV Rt. workers and merging the entire AV Rt. into the 
AVU. "In the last months of the coalition's power, therefore, 
all the state enterprise assets and the entire privatization 
process ended up in the hand of those who follow a liberal 
ideology and of the former system's apparatchiks. This 
situation is catastrophic from the points of view of the 
country's economy and future, as well as from the point of view 
of the coalition's election prospects." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The National Information Office Does </F>
Not Plan Any More Large-Scale Campaigns Before the Elections"] 
  [Text] Not long ago the Office of the Prime Minister 
published a brochure to describe the activities of the 
government during the past four years. The publication, which 
was prepared in a million copies, cost 26 million forints for 
printing and 15 million for mailing, which was absorbed by the 
budget of the National Information Office [NTI]. According to 
opposition opinions, this publication is nothing more than 
publicly financed election propaganda that suppresses everything 
negative. 
  NTI head Gyorgy Varga Domokos informed us in response to our 
questions that the cost of the brochures, which have so far been 
published in Hungarian and will soon also appear in foreign 
languages, along with the publicity connected with their 
publication, has not been more than one-fifth of the office's 
annual budget. (The NTI's 1994 budget was 190 million forints, 
with additional funds left over from last year.) Discussing the 
timing, the office chief believes that it would not have been 
possible to give an accounting of four years of government 
activity after only three and a half years, although he would 
have preferred it if the brochure had appeared a few weeks 
earlier. Nevertheless, the publishing date was postponed 
because they wanted to prepare a high-quality publication that 
contained correct data and was "worthy of all the effort that 
had been put into it." 
  Another volume will soon appear in several foreign languages 
and in considerably fewer copies, which will be distributed much 
more narrowly, mainly to foreign embassies and libraries. This 
high-quality publication--which will not cost more than 8 
million--will not be an account of accomplishments but is 
intended instead to give an overview of our country's 1,000-year 
history and the past four years. Both publications serve the 
NTI's new mission. Previously the office's main job was to 
continually correct the supposedly distorted international image 
of the country that was propagated by the press. From now on, 
however, the NTI wants to improve our image in the long term by 
providing information about our accomplishments and giving some 
idea of our culture. In the period before the elections, 
however, this was their first and at the same time their last 
large-scale campaign undertaking (with the possible exception of 
a specialized publication about the change to a market economy, 
which will appear in fewer copies for a narrower audience.) 
Nevertheless, according to Gyorgy Varga Domokos, much 
information should be provided both at home and abroad, because 
"public opinion must not be left without knowledge of our 
accomplishments," and it is not even possible to begin the next 
four-year period without drawing up a balance.

<F P=106> [Laszlo Kassovitz report: "The Offer of the Elections"] </F>
  [Text] Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian Justice 
and Life Party [MIEP], was one of the speakers at the event 
called "Parties' Forum" in the Kaposvar County Hall. 
  We have peace, we do not have order, and we have stability, 
Csurka said, but not the kind that the country's people want 
because it is not based on the will of the majority of the 
people, and because it is not just. Order and democracy can 
only be built on the basis of justice and can only appear with 
the support of the majority. However, the current leadership 
does not have the people's support because the government 
parties, just like the opposition parties, are not implementing 
the programs that they announced before the elections. 
  Equality, of which nothing was implemented, was the great 
promise of socialism. Liberalism is the current promise. 
However, liberalism is only enjoyed by those people who have 
come through with an advantage from the previous regime. For 
the vast majority of people, there is no freedom. There is 
coercion, economic coercion, because power is concentrated in 
the hands of the same people as before. 
  Two alternatives exist: the old and the new, the national 
and the non-national. 
  The MIEP belongs to the national. Our political program is 
to gain economic power, which can only be successful with the 
help of state power. If this is not achieved then the state 
will remain exposed to the nomenclature that was created in the 
previous regime. 
  The current leadership, including the government and the 
opposition, has failed. The reason has to be sought in the 
pacts that were used to deceive the masses. 
  Who has acquired the factories that are worth huge amounts 
of 
money? The banks? Who skims off from the transformation? 
  The privatization companies, many of which are joint 
ventures 
or foreign owned. The reason for this situation lies in the 
decision of the [former] Nemeth government to order that nothing 
could be privatized without the participation of a privatization 
company. In this way, he gave away the Hungarian state's 
revenue and profits from the change of ownership. All the 
enterprises of the State Property Management Corporation [AV RT] 
did not make as much profit as the amount that had to be paid by 
the AV RT for privatization. 
  While news of scandals in the world of banking and brokering 
companies are emerging, the so-called bank consolidation has 
started. All of them have to be relieved, one by one, of their 
bad debts! The only thing that is not revealed is when these 
bad debts arose and why the taxpayers have to bear the financial 
consequences. 
  Naturally, some of them arose in the glorious 1980's when 
the 
huge enterprises had to be supported, and they still collapsed. 
However, the banks are also to be relieved of those loans that 
they have given out since 1990. And to whom? Since 1990, the 
bad loans have originated from allocations to comrades. Now, 
Hungarian society should line up and pay for the opulence of the 
nomenclature, so that privatization can go ahead! This is what 
they want. 
  Therefore, the task is to break the power of the banking 
oligarchy. If this does not happen, all the parties can keep 
promising anything that is pleasant to hear, but the system will 
not change at all. It cannot change because it has become an 
integral part of the world system based on the politics of the 
World Bank, that demands a significant influence on the various 
economies and financial systems. 
  We have to draw up our own program. We are not living in a 
many centuries old economy that has developed through constant 
rationalization, but rather we are in a forced situation. 
Everyone has to be freed from this coercion; otherwise, people 
will never accept the current order, will not multiply, will let 
their territories be used by aliens, resign themselves always to 
be led against their own interests, and finally disappear. This 
danger will remain until they have a middle class and a 
leadership with national sentiments. 
  For the emergence of this society with national sentiments, 
the National Basic Curriculum, which was completed as long ago 
as 1990, is indispensable, but the debates about accepting or, 
rather, rejecting it can mostly be called sabotage. Education 
was immediately removed from the program, and the Federation of 
Young Democrats was the leading force in this. 
  It is unimaginable for the nation not to suffer serious 
damage if the ranks of the Hungarian middle classes are only 
filled through the Soros [Hungarian-American businessman] 
Foundation, and the young people of those groups of society that 
do not belong to this are automatically excluded. Money and 
state support is needed for education, and a nation state is 
needed to implement it. However, while the bourgeoisie that is 
kept in power by the World Bank defines the use of the money, 
very little is left for educational purposes. 
  Together with education, we also want to strengthen the 
family, the basic cell of society. We say that every mother 
with three children should receive the minimum wage, regardless 
of whether she works, until the end of her life. Other state 
benefits should be added to this to form the basis for her 
pension. All this should be added to her pension basis acquired 
while employed elsewhere. The precondition for all this is that 
society must produce people who do not have to rely on society's 
help in their adult lives.

<F P=106> [Article by Roman Strzemiecki: "Walesa for Everyone"] </F>
  [Text] As early as the middle of December 1993, President 
Lech Walesa readily and frequently granted interviews, thereby 
turning up the pressure on the West and gaining what was not to 
be had through diplomatic channels. The greatest splash was 
produced by the interviews granted to THE WASHINGTON POST, the 
renowned BBC, and French television. Lech Walesa warned that 
"life may cause us to wind up making military arrangements with 
Ukraine if we do not get into NATO," stating that "it is not 
possible to be a partner without being a participant," and 
ultimately, just before the meeting in Brussels, described the 
U.S. initiative "Partnership for Peace" as blackmail. 
  In December, Minister Andrzej Olechowski held many talks in 
Washington, trying (unfortunately, with little result) to have 
the "proposal for nonrejection," as the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs terms Partnership for Peace, turned into an 
institutional precursor for entry into NATO. Recently [in 
January], Olechowski proceeded to Bonn, hoping for a warm 
response from the Germans. There, as well, unfortunately, he did 
not have much luck, and his reception by Klaus Kinkel was 
downright frosty. Despite this, he visited the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, clarifying Poland's position through the 
publication of several articles in the opinion-molding 
foreign-affairs press. On 1 December, IZVESTIYA carried an 
article by Olechowski entitled "Poland's Concerns." Just before 
the NATO summit in Brussels, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU carried 
another article by the chief Polish diplomat in which Olechowski 
gave assurances that "we are not afraid of Russia but, rather, 
of the objective situation that may push it to behave in a 
manner that is threatening to Poland. This situation is the 
security vacuum that now exists in Europe." The Polish-U.S. 
lobby took up the call to action in the United States. 
  The result of Lech Walesa's efforts was the trip made before 
the Brussels summit by Ambassador [to the UN] Madeleine Albright 
(a Czech by extraction) and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, General John Shalikashvili (born in Warsaw), to the 
"Visegrad" capitals. The trip by the two politicians showed that 
"four" are not only going at different speeds but that the 
Czechs clearly indicate that they do not feel any commonality of 
interests with their neighbors. 
  Lech Walesa's closest ally turned out to be the president of 
Slovakia, Michal Kovac, who as early as the first part of 
January proposed that our countries immediately be granted "full 
political membership in NATO and security guarantees." The 
Hungarians, who did not share Walesa's angry reaction to the 
proposal from Albright and Shalikashvili, did not make life easy 
for Walesa. 
  Just before the Brussels summit, a real contest developed. 
The parliament of Bulgaria demanded that NATO treat that country 
the same as the "Visegrad" countries, Romania officially asked 
for accession to NATO, and, several days later, Algirdas 
Brazauskas, the president of Lithuania, submitted a similar 
petition. In response to the Polish offensive, Moscow recently 
launched a counteroffensive. Vyacheslav Kostikov, spokesman for 
President Yeltsin, stated That admitting the countries of 
Central Europe into NATO would bring the Russian reforms to a 
halt. The Russian Army "would be furious," and Russia "would 
have to form its own military-political bloc."

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislaw Marek Krolak: "The Soul Would Like To </F>
Be in Paradise"] 
  [Text] A hundred days is too short a period of time to sum 
up the Cabinet activities but long enough to notice main trends. 
At this point, Pawlak's government is in power three times 
longer than his prime ministership following the fall of the 
Olszewski government. We recall this incident not without 
reason. One can clearly see the continuation of the same 
political line: the tendency to obliterate divisions between the 
Polish People's Republic (PRL) and Poland as it is now, and a 
departure from all promises given during the election campaign. 
  The defeat of post-Solidarity parties and the poor showing 
of 
the BBWR [Nonpartly Bloc in Support of Reforms], the 
presidential party formed in such a hurry, in the 19 September 
elections allowed the left to legally take power and form a 
government. It seemed to some people that one had but to look to 
see the slogan "All power in the hands of the people's councils" 
[a communist-era slogan]." There was no lack of people who 
scared others with the return of communism. Nothing of that sort 
happened because it could not happen. But it does not mean that 
nothing happened. The most important threat is not the return of 
a sinister ideology that is still claiming victims in the 
Balkans and the Caucasus but, rather, the final legalization of 
the succession inherited from the PRL. Erasing dividing lines 
between the thief and his victim, betrayal and patriotism, 
independence and subordination to a foreign power must sooner or 
later influence the country's defense and society's bearings. 
<H5>  The Comrades Are Returning </H5>
  The first signal given to the owners of People's Poland that 
it was time to return to the scene was sent as soon as 26 
October at the swearing-in ceremony of Pawlak's government in 
the Belweder [the presidential residence]. Leszek Miller, the 
representive of the "beton'1 [hard-liners] in the PZPR [Polish 
United Workers Party] (communist party), who is, together with 
Rakowski [Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the last first secretary of the 
PZPR], accused of illegal money dealings with the Soviets to 
finance the 1989 elections, became a minister. This could appear 
to be an incident--the price Pawlak had to pay because 
Kwasniewski was too weak to pacify Miller's supporters in his 
own party. Today, unceremoniously, Miller accuses Solidarity of 
illegally receiving money from the West. The fact that the 
attorney general is his colleague from the SLD [Democratic Left 
Alliance] is of lesser importance. What is important, however, 
is that today there are many such Millers. They are in the 
government, in the central administration, and in the 
voivodships. The best example may be that of Ireneusz Sekula. 
This decision on the part of Waldemar Pawlak symbolically 
closes the period of transition that began after the 1989 
elections. It would be hard to find a clearer political message 
for a population that was under communism for 45 years. Sekula, 
appointed president of the Main Customs Office, was, in 
Rakowski's government, responsible for the creation of a legal 
base that allowed for the enfranchisement of the 
nomenklatura, and he himself is today a beneficiary 
of that decision. Pawlak's government seemd to be saying, 
paraphrasing president Walesa, "Comrades, the time of pretending 
that we are not here is over," and "Take power into your own 
hands." In such a situation, should one be surprised that local 
apparatchiks of the coalition government are throwing out 
voivodes in order to take over their jobs? This process is not 
merely the replacement of one group of people by another. The 
clientele of the SLD and the PSL [Polish Peasant Party] [the two 
parties in the governing coalition] throughout the years has 
gotten so accustomed to sinecure and power that to try to stop 
this wave could cause mutiny in its own party ranks. From the 
perspective of local, presidential, and eventually parliamentary 
elections, the state interest must lose with the interest of the 
party. For this reason, Pawlak postponed the county (powiaty) 
reform, hoping to distribute these seats after succesful 
elections in June. 
  This whole process is, in a way, completed with the return 
of 
higher security officials to the departments directly 
responsible for state security. The ridiculed and discredited 
idea of vetting has died, and it is doubtful that it will ever 
have another chance. Fortunately, there are no longer any 
Russian garrisons in Poland that served as centers for 
espionage. However, foreign press information that our country 
is an object of strong intelligence penetration confirms fears 
that foreign agents may still, in an essential way, influence 
the decisionmaking process in Poland. 
<H5>  Cynical Treatment of the Electorate </H5>
  The slogan "It doesn't have to be like this anymore" [the 
main SLD election campaign slogan] turns out to be only a 
campaign promise. The SLD treated its own electorate rather 
cynically, while the PSL, often in good faith, was promising 
farmer paradise without consideration for what the state could 
deliver. Both of these parties do not know how to fulfill these 
declarations. That demagoguery ended soon after these parties 
won the elections, and the slightly embarassed Pawlak stated in 
the Sejm that he must continue the policy of the previous 
governments. It is good, obviously, that the government does not 
intend to destroy what the other governments accomplished during 
past four years. But what is troublesome is the fact that, in 
the programs and actions of Pawlak's Cabinet, there are no new 
ideas that would stimulate faster growth. In the explanatory 
statement to the draft budget law, there is no trace left of the 
preelection rethoric on the tragic recession, growth stimulation 
through higher inflation, radical changes in the exchange rate 
of the dollar, or increased emission of the currency in order to 
cover social expenses. On the other hand, the clearly visible 
tendency in 1993 of an improvement in the state of public 
finances greatly eased the way for the start of Prime Minister 
Pawlak's government. However, because the minister of finance 
came to the conclusion that further balancing of the budget by 
means of cutting expenses was not possible, budget revenues and 
outlays were enlarged. From the current year's tax law, we know 
whence the revenues are to come. Above all, those who voted for 
the left will pay for them: consumers and small businesses. "You 
wanted new people in power, so you have it," one would like to 
say, if it were not for the fact that here we are talking about 
the poorest layers of society. 
<H5>  Who in Reality Has Power? </H5>
  Waldemar Pawlak seems to be aware of the danger of an 
outbreak of social discontent. The prime minister's expose just 
before the end of the year can be read as an expression of 
anxiety, that matters are not following the earlier forecast. 
This begs the essential question: Who in this Cabinet has the 
deciding voice? 
  Already the battle surrounding the placing of people in 
certain ministries (when Waldemar Pawlak withdrew certain people 
from the list of names given to the president and replaced them 
with SLD names) proves that nothing of importance can occur 
without Aleksander Kwasniewski's approval. I do not claim that 
the SLD leadership fulfills the role of a Politburo in relation 
to Pawlak's government. However, there is no doubt that it is 
precisely this party [SLD] that makes the strategic decisions. 
The SLD consistently guards the interests of the PRL 
nomenklatura, which now has time for an undisturbed 
strengthening of its position in the economy. Taking over 
economic control of the country's economic life, which was 
allowed by the previous governments under the rulings of this 
present Cabinet, will result in broadening and such a 
strenghtening of the structures that no changes will be possible 
in the future. The fundamentals of privatization as proposed by 
Minister Kaczmarek constitute but one example of such a policy. 
The forecast of Lech Mazewski, associated with the liberal 
circles of the previous governments, that we are moving toward a 
South American type of capitalism, where a very narrow group of 
people control the whole economy, appears to be closer to 
realization. This will support the formation of a new 
arrangement on the political scene. In the new political 
configuration, there may be found liberals from the SLD, the KLD 
[Liberal-Democratic Congress], and UD [Democratic Union]. The 
process of rapprochement of former political adversaries will 
demand time and will depend on both the presidential elections 
and the behavior of the Solidarity groups now outside 
parliament. But the common economic interest, the similar 
liberal views ideologically, and the fact that they share the 
same electorate will lead to unity and ignoring biographical 
differences. 
<H5>  The Force in Adapting Oneself </H5>
  The strength of Waldemar Pawlak's government is in accepting 
the strategy of accommodation. This government does not wish to 
antagonize either the opposition, the president, foreign 
relations, or the mass media, or even the church, whose support 
it seeks, wishing to create the impression that it is the only 
political force defending national traditions and Christian 
values. Such a strategy may bring success under the condition 
that it will not be necessary to seek support from the 
electorate. In the meantime, the presidential election will take 
place in two years' time [late 1995]; this election designates 
the time frame in which the government will have to account for 
its actions to date. In this time frame, the difference in PSL 
versus SLD interests will become clear. Both Aleksander 
Kwasniewski and Waldemar Pawlak dream about the Belweder. The 
altercations with Lech Walesa are thus unavoidable. Prime 
Minister Pawlak has no need to hurry. He is counting on the fact 
that time is on his side. He can wait--under the condition that 
the possible failure of the government will be blamed on the 
coalition partner [the SLD]. But Aleksander Kwasniewski has to 
play the same game. He looks after the businessmen but courts 
the electorate; he does not attack the church, but he pays 
careful attention to the activities of Barbara Labuda [UD 
deputy, who is outspoken in her support of abortion rights]. 
Both Pawlak and Kwasniewski have to keep in mind the fourth 
presidential candidate--without knowing yet who this person will 
be, other than Lech Walesa. How this game will end, it is hard 
to forecast at this time. If it is true, as Jacek Soska [PSL 
deputy] claims, that Waldemar Pawlak has no intellectual 
capacity at his disposal, his government is working not for him 
but for Aleksander Kwasniewski.

<F P=106> [Article by Jerzy Baczynski: "Left Side, Right Side"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] When ministers dispute how to 
apportion budget outlays, it means that it is the last stage of 
work on the budget. The basic framework of the budget is created 
by professionals at the Ministry of Finance (in cooperation with 
the Central Planning Office and the National Bank of Poland). It 
usually begins with an analysis of the current economic 
conditions, a forecast for the next year, and determination of 
the so-called fixed obligations of the budget. Only then is 
superposed a grid of political and economic priorities that can 
be debated. Any breach of this logic or any major error of the 
forecast can lead to a crisis of public finance. We have 
experienced such crises on our own skin; in the last few years 
the real world of the budget kept diverging from the assumptions. 
<H5>  The Minister's Dream </H5>
  Errors could not be avoided in 1993 either, although this 
time they were positive errors, such as every minister of 
finance dreams of. Last year budgetary receipts were more than 4 
percent (17.5 trillion zlotys, or Z17.5 trillion) higher than 
planned, while outlays were 2 percent (Z10 trillion) lower, and 
the deficit is certain not to exceed Z60 trillion instead of the 
anticipated Z81 trillion. These surprisingly good results were 
due chiefly to higher receipts from the personal income tax and 
a decline in the number of old-age pensions and annuities as 
well as the delay in revaluing them, along with lower outlays on 
servicing the foreign debt (a decline in interest rates, absence 
of an agreement with the so-called Club of London), and... the 
known difficulties in financing the budget deficit. At any rate, 
H. Suchocka's government bequeathed to its successors an 
underutilized "deficit cap," meaning that the growth in domestic 
debt was less (by Z28 trillion) than expected. When speaking of 
the dramatic condition of public finance it should also be borne 
in mind that in October 1993, for the first time in a long time, 
there was a budget surplus and in November the budget was 
balanced. Hence, a definite trend toward an improvement in 
public finance arose in 1993, which greatly facilitated the 
start of the new government under Prime Minister Pawlak. 
  Likewise, the economic situation in 1993 (despite the 
unemployment and a negative balance of foreign trade) warrants 
an optimistic forecast for 1994. According to the recent report 
of the Central Planning Office, for 1993 industrial output will 
be 7 percent higher than in the preceding year; foreign trade 
began finally to improve as of last October (owing to the August 
devaluation); and the financial performance of enterprises and 
their possibilities for raising wages also are better.... Were 
it not for November and December, when food prices soared, 
inflation would remain at the planned level. [passage omitted] 
  The macroeconomic assumptions for 1994 of W. Pawlak's 
government do not diverge from those announced earlier by the 
previous government: That is, a 4.5 percent increase in the GDP; 
27-percent inflation (23 percent as measured from December 1994 
to December 1993); a faster increase in exports (6 percent) than 
in imports; the maintenance of a creeping (in measure with the 
inflation) devaluation of the zloty; a limited growth of 
unemployment (to up to 190,000); and maintenance of 
civil-service salaries at the level of 91 percent of the wages 
paid in the private sector. We can thus expect a peaceful 
continuation and strengthening of positive tendencies in the 
economy. Fortunately, the rationale of the 1994 budget law 
contains no trace of the campaign rhetoric about the tragic 
recession, the need to stimulate growth by spurring inflation, a 
radical change in the exchange rate of the dollar, or printing 
more money in measure with the perceived social needs. As Deputy 
Prime Minister Borowski said recently in the Sejm, "Life has 
taught everyone to distance himself from promises and to 
perceive the reality humbly." 
<H5>  Five Priorities </H5>
  I emphasize that the 1994 budget is largely predicated on 
continuing the economic policy of the preceding government, 
although that is certainly not politically convenient to the new 
government. But since I myself, following the elections last 
September, had expressed fears that the new government might "go 
on a rampage" and thus risk economic stability, I wish to state 
now that the government of Waldemar Pawlak is displaying a 
commendably realistic and responsible attitude. This does not at 
all mean that the 1994 budget draft lacks some leftist emphasis 
that clearly reflects the change in political priorities. 
  When speaking of the 1994 budget, Deputy Prime Minister 
Borowski mentioned five assumptions on which its final draft was 
based: 
  --Halting the decline in outlays on government operation. 
This concerns increasing civil-service salaries to keep in step 
with the inflation and maintaining the real value of material 
expenditures. 
  --Strengthening the protection of the neediest by, among 
other things, increasing expenditures on welfare, raising the 
minimum old-age pensions and annuities, and providing funds for 
so-called housing allowances. 
  --As to restructuring the economy, providing the funds 
needed 
for social protection due to the shutdowns of unprofitable 
mines, maintaining arms industry plants in operation by giving 
them government orders, building roads and highways, and 
providing debt relief for enterprises and banks. 
  --Stimulating the economy by broadening investment tax 
relief; promoting exports and investments by, among other 
things, providing government loan guarantees and credit 
insurance. 
  --Providing the funds needed to successfully complete the 
steps being taken to reduce foreign debt and to utilize foreign 
capital more efficiently. 
  It is worth noting that these five priorities differ from 
the 
traditional so-called branch priorities. Thus, they make no 
mention of any privileged treatment of, e.g., education, 
culture, or health services, and neither are there any points 
devoted to agriculture, national defense, or the police. The 
proposed priorities are certain to meet with criticism from many 
deputies lobbying for the interests of their constituencies, but 
at the same time, on resorting to the transfer method, they 
should make for easier discussion with representatives of branch 
interest groups. 
  However, an important provision is missing from the above 
enumeration, and this casts a huge reflection on the shape of 
the 1994 budget. Namely, the minister of finance has earlier 
declared, "The possibilities for balancing the budget by 
slashing expenditures are exhausted." As a result, the most 
characteristic feature of the 1994 budget will be a considerable 
increase in the outlays and receipts of the state. 
<H5>  Receipts, Outlays, and the Deficit </H5>
  The 1994 budgetary receipts are envisaged at Z610 trillion, 
i.e., 35 percent more than in 1993, or, in real terms, after 
allowance is made for price increases, 6.5 percent more. As for 
budgetary outlays, they are envisaged at Z693 trillion, which 
means a nominal increase of 37.5 percent, or an increase of 8.3 
percent in real terms. Hence, the planned budget deficit is to 
amount to Z83 trillion compared with, let me point out, Z60 
trillion in 1993. 
  We already know more or less where the higher receipts will 
come from. Chiefly from taxes: This year the government intends 
to collect Z506 trillion from taxpayers, compared with Z363 
trillion in 1993. Thus, we have new income tax rates, the 
lump-sum tax payable by small businesses, the extension of the 
VAT to businesses with incomes of more than Z1.2 billion a year 
(previously the minimum level was Z4 billion), and the 
restrictions on certain tax exemptions and relief. The brunt of 
financing the greater obligations of the state budget will be 
borne by consumers and small businesses. 
  On the expenditures side a special place is occupied by 
servicing the foreign debt (Z30 trillion) and the domestic debt 
(Z82 trillion). The nation's total foreign debt in 1993 was 
about Z1,000 trillion, and domestic debt Z360 trillion. 
Fortunately, we are servicing our foreign debt only partially, 
but even so, taken as a whole, the burden of servicing both the 
domestic and the foreign debt will consume as much as 16 percent 
of all budgetary outlays. To the government this is a warning to 
desist from hastily contracting any more loans for financing 
budgetary outlays and to utilize foreign credit rationally. Of 
the Z693 trillion in outlays, after the outlays on debt 
servicing are deducted, there remains about Z580 trillion, of 
which Z362 trillion is to be spent on civil-service salaries and 
similar government expenditures. 
  In the budget draft the expenditures are listed in several 
hundred tables. In view of the occasional differences in 
calculating techniques, not all the figures are directly 
comparable with the expenditures in 1993. Even so, assuming the 
classical breakdown by ministries, the largest beneficiaries of 
the 1994 budget are the ministries of: labor and social welfare 
(outlays higher by more than one-third), transportation, foreign 
trade, and science. On the other hand, lower than average 
outlays are planned for construction, communications, higher 
education, the judiciary, public security, and national defense. 
Education will be given somewhat more money (relatively 
speaking) than health care. As regards the kinds of outlays, 
those increasing the most are, in addition to debt servicing, 
the outlays on housing loan guarantees (increased to Z7 trillion 
from Z2.6), the mortgage credit fund (to Z800 billion from 
Z100), expenditures on industrial restructuring (to Z6 trillion 
from Z2), and on old-age pensions and annuities for the defense 
ministry's personnel, and chiefly on subsidies for social 
security (to Z140 trillion from Z104). This listing reveals 
quite unambiguously the priorities of the current government. 
  In any budget debate--and this time it will not be otherwise 
either--the question of how realistic the budget is must be 
raised. The 1994 draft budget seems to be very tightly 
stretched. The figures on planned tax revenues seem rather 
optimistic, as do the possibilities for financing the deficit, 
especially in view of the unbending attitude of the National 
Bank of Poland [the central bank], which has offered only Z30 
trillion to support the budget. The inflation rate envisaged for 
this year seems rather optimistic, even if assuming slower price 
increases--and higher inflation may make shambles of the entire 
budget. In its turn, the marked increase in the tax burden may 
affect adversely investment and the growth in personal 
consumption, thus slowing down the anticipated rate of economic 
growth. Furthermore, the need to finance the high deficit may 
reduce the supply of credit available for the economy. The 
perils involved in executing such an expansive budget are 
numerous--and in this case, unlike in politics, the left side 
(receipts) must always be in accord with the right (outlays). 
  In brief, the government has undertaken a risky attempt to 
increase public expenditures, motivated by important social 
considerations. Still, contrary to many previous fears, the 
presented draft budget does not exceed the limits of permissible 
political corrections, even though it is very close to the limit 
of economic safety.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrzej Zybala: "Poland Behind the Wall: The </F>
Government Intends to Jack Up Duties on Farm Products in Order 
To Reduce Them Later From a Higher Level and Still Follow the 
Decisions of GATT's Uruguay Round"] 
  [Text] Polish duties are three to four times as high as 
those applying in West Europe and the United States. We protect 
our market more strongly than do Hungarians and Czechs. Contrary 
to the comments of PSL [Polish Peasant Party] Sejm deputies, 
Polish borders are not at all wide open. 
  In the West, the average duty rate at present is 4 percent, 
while in Poland it is more than 10 percent. Even so, the 
developed countries decided that their duty rates are too high 
for trade to become a genuine locomotive of the world economy. 
During the seven-year-long Uruguay Round, which was completed in 
December 1993, it was decided that, in the next few years, the 
average duty rate would be reduced to less than 3 percent and 
all trade restraints in the form of countervailing fees, border 
taxes, etc. would be abolished. According to experts, this will 
cause world trade to increase by $200-300 billion. According to 
the OECD and the World Bank, the principal beneficiaries of the 
new trade agreement, which will begin to be binding as early as 
at the beginning of 1995, are, however, to be the developing 
countries, which in the next few years will earn an additional 
$130 billion. Soon now, sharp rivalry over dividing up that 
substantial sum will begin. Yet, at the same time, Polish 
industry and farming, instead of getting ready to expand, are 
seeking security by advocating higher duty barriers. 
  Following a temporary slash in Polish duties to a level not 
much higher than in the West (5.5 percent), they were jacked up 
since mid-1991 to levels several times as high as in the 
West--as high as 18.8 percent. The tariff increases applied 
chiefly to the least transformed [i.e., least adapted to market 
reforms] industries, such as textile, footwear, and food. Thus, 
duties of as much as 20 percent became levied on consumer goods, 
20-35 percent on farm products and textiles, and 45 percent on 
luxury goods. According to Tomasz Jodko, director of the 
Department for Multilateral Agreements at the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations, this whole subject is beset by 
inconsistency. Sometimes the failures of certain branches of the 
economy are blamed on high interest rates and sometimes on 
supposedly low tariff duties. It is symptomatic that increases 
in tariff duties are considered when miners strike. 
  Yet, after World War II, the liberalization of trade became 
the principal locomotive of world economic growth. The seven 
previous GATT rounds have resulted in an eightfold reduction of 
duty rates, and, in the years 1950-75, this resulted in a 
fivefold growth in the volume of world trade, along with growth 
of the generated world product. In 1982, when world trade grew 
by only about 3 percent, generated world product diminished by 2 
percent. In Belgium and the Netherlands, trade accounts for more 
than 70 percent of the gross national product [GNP]. In 
contrast, in Poland, foreign trade accounts for barely 20 
percent of the GNP. And this proportion is going to be even 
lower now that the government wants, contrary to worldwide 
trends, to surround Poland with a tariff wall. 
  Since 1991, protection of domestic products has been 
increasing not only through duty raises, which account for 70 
percent of its extent. Toward the end of 1992, a 6-percent 
border tax, levied on the value of merchandise plus duty, was 
introduced. Moreover, the basis for levying duties was augmented 
by including the cost of transportation and insurance. In this 
connection, unlike in the West, the successive Polish 
Governments arrogated to themselves rather than to the 
parliament the power of fixing duty rates. As if on purpose, 
they provoked pressures from various interest groups. In the 
years 1990-91 alone, the government revised more than 90 
implementing acts. It was only after signing the Association 
Agreement between Poland and the European Union and owing to the 
understanding with GATT that the government lost the power to 
manipulate duty rates for about 75 percent of goods. [From now 
on] tariff revisions will require GATT consultation, but it is 
hard to say whether that will cool the fevered temperament of 
the Polish farm lobby. 
  Yet estimates of the Institute for Business Cycles and 
Foreign Trade Prices (IKCHZ) indicate that the liberalization of 
tariffs owing to the Association Agreement between Poland and 
the European Union will contribute to increasing Poland's 
foreign trade revenues. In the next few years, exports of Polish 
manufactured goods alone should increase by about $70 million. 
To be sure, Professor Elzbieta Kawecka-Wyrzykowska of the IKCHZ 
admits that it is not much, but, still, tariff liberalization 
affords a tremendous opportunity for the Polish economy. 
  She commented, "Polish exports by now are impeded not so 
much 
by customs barriers, which are low, with the exception of farm 
products, as by their intrinsic weaknesses." 
  As if that were not enough, we are not utilizing export 
quotas--i.e., the opportunities for selling goods on European 
markets at preferential duty rates. This applies chiefly to farm 
products. For example, Polish exporters sold only 4-10 percent 
of the permissible quantities [under the quotas] of pork and 
potato starch, and even smaller amounts of butter, cheese, eggs, 
and chickens. As for sales of, for example, live geese and their 
eggs, they are impeded by a strange regulation--namely, the 
Ministry of Agriculture has prohibited the exports of live geese 
because it dreads duplication of Polish breeding stock abroad. 
  Had other countries followed the same mentality, the 
invention of television or computers would not to this day be a 
widespread boon. 
  Concerning the growth in exports owing to tariff 
liberalization, Andrzej Byrt, deputy minister for foreign 
economic relations, is much more optimistic. He estimates that 
the ending of the Uruguay Round will result in a $1-billion 
annual increase in our exports. At the same time, Poland's GNP 
will grow. But that hardly sounds plausible because, in Poland, 
duty rates are viewed as a means of not only getting rid of 
[foreign] competition but also of enriching the state coffers. 
Thus, while in recent years budgetary receipts from customs 
duties have been rising, Poland's participation in world trade 
has been declining. Too many overprotected sectors of the 
economy have remained impervious to market reforms. Thus, while 
as recently as in 1991 customs duties accounted for 3.7 percent 
of budgetary receipts, a year later they soared to 27 percent. 
In 1992, the budget earned 27 trillion zlotys [Z] (Z27 trillion) 
in receipts from customs duties alone or, when receipts from the 
border tax are included, Z46.5 trillion. In 1993, these receipts 
doubled. The duties levied have caused major increases not only 
in the prices of imported finished goods but also in the 
manufacturing cost of many domestic goods produced with imported 
raw materials. In the cosmetics industry, many plants have to 
import as much as 70 percent of ingredients. Moreover, duties 
also are levied on goods and raw materials not produced in 
Poland. For example, there is a 10-percent duty on video cameras 
and on many ingredients used in the manufacture of 
cosmetics--for example, on basic detergents for shampoo 
production (15-percent duty) or on cosmetic packagings (also 
15-percent). All the more so considering that, in Poland, unlike 
in the West, the differences in the size of duties levied on 
semifinished products and raw materials and those levied on 
finished products are not appropriately wide. 
  In some cases, such duties are even the same--for example, 
for wine imported in bulk and for bottled wine. This is causing 
problems for Warsaw Imported Wine Cellars and six other similar 
establishments. As a result, imports of wine in cistern tanks 
have almost completely ceased, and bottling plants had to lay 
off hundreds of employees. By the same token, the consumer is 
condemned to pay higher prices for wine imported in bottles. 
  Prof. Kawecka-Wyrzykowska said, "Our biggest losses will 
come 
as our economy becomes a bigger mess and further loses its 
competitiveness." She added that, to be sure, farmers are 
accusing the government of failing to protect the food market, 
but, were not it for the imports, we would certainly be still 
waiting a long time before being able to drink milk or yogurt in 
colorful packagings. Jolanta Zombirt, adviser to the Government 
Commissioner for European Integration, said, "Sometimes initial 
losses have to be risked in order to join the company of the 
economically strongest countries. We would thus gain the cachet 
of a safe country, in which European customs regulations are 
binding. To the potential foreign investor, this would mean a 
guarantee that Poland is not some banana republic and will not, 
unlike it has been doing until recently, keep changing its 
customs regulations overnight." 
  Although duty rates have been fixed in international 
agreements, the government is exploring the possibilities for 
bypassing them. Apparently it has stumbled on such possibilities 
as regards farm products. To be sure, it has presented a 
proposal for reducing duty rates by one-third in accordance with 
the GATT agreement, but, at the same time, it is raising them to 
make up for having to abolish other fees (e.g., countervailing 
fees) under the agreement, so that the prices of imported 
merchandise are certain to rise. For example, the duty on butter 
will be 140 percent after the countervailing fees and the border 
tax are abolished, whereas, at present, it is 40 percent. The 
duty on wheat is to be doubled. The government intends to raise 
duty rates in order to reduce them later from a higher level and 
still look like it is following the decisions of the Uruguay 
Round.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bill Reynolds: "Party Weakens Slovak </F>
Coalition"] 
  [Text] With the stability of Slovakia's governing coalition 
hanging in the balance, the fight for control of the Slovak 
National Party (SNS) entered a decisive phase mid-January as the 
two warring factions began gearing up for next month's party 
congress. 
  SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak is battling Deputy Chairman 
Marian Andel and Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes for the support 
of SNS delegates from across Slovakia. The delegates will attend 
a special Feb. 19 party congress called to resolve the 
leadership conflict. 
  Jozef Hrabina, a former party secretary, said there were two 
possible outcomes of the power struggle: the party would split, 
or one faction would simply leave. 
  The key to victory lies in successfully influencing the 
delegates, Hrabina said. "The rank and file base their opinions 
on the information they get from the top." 
  The SNS has been the junior partner in the Slovak government 
since October, when Andel and Prokes dragged a reluctant Cernak 
into a coalition agreement with Premier Vladimir Meciar's ruling 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). With 14 seats in 
parliament, SNS provided Meciar's government with a bare 
majority in the 150-seat Slovak parliament. The rift within the 
SNS, however, has rendered the coalition virtually unworkable. 
  Cernak, who is engaged in a year-old personal feud with 
Meciar, charged Andel, Prokes and other colleagues with blindly 
following HZDS in exchange for power. In turn, Cernak was 
attacked for allegedly holding secret talks with ethnic 
Hungarian politicians to topple the government. 
  The breaking point came Dec. 21, when Cernak and five other 
SNS parliamentary deputies voted against Meciar's 1994 state 
budget. Cernak and his loyalists then formed the "National 
Democratic Club" of SNS, sealing the breach within the party. 
  The faction led by Prokes and Andel gained the upper hand on 
Jan. 15, when the SNS Central Council passed--by 29 to 15 with 
eight abstentions--a no confidence vote in Cernak. The council 
also dismissed several deputy chairmen and accepted the 
resignation of SNS General Secretary Igor Uhrik, who later 
accused Andel and Prokes of "slavishly" supporting Meciar. 
  After Cernak rejected a request that he resign, the council 
called the special congress, to be held in Zilina, north 
Slovakia, and adopted a resolution lamenting the party's 
divisiveness, "at a time when Hungarian irredentists in south 
Slovakia are jeopardizing our country's integrity." 
  A party press conference following the Jan. 15 session only 
served to aggravate the split. Prokes said Cernak's on-and-off 
support for the coalition was hurting Slovakia's international 
credibility, while Cernak reiterated his doubts about the 
coalition's ability to function. 
  Cernak kept up the fight last week when his parliamentary 
deputies' club introduced an amendment to the privatization law 
aimed at preventing the "accumulation of economic and political 
power." Specifically, the amendment would separate the positions 
of privatization minister and chairman of the National Property 
Fund, both currently held by Meciar. 
  After Meciar steered the country through the breakup of 
Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the SNS, which advocated 
Slovak independence, has been cast adrift. Bereft of a unifying 
cause, the party has fished about for a new program while 
continuing to criticize Hungarian leaders in both south Slovakia 
and Budapest. The SNS now officially defines itself as a 
"left-of-center party with a social dimension." 
  The Slovak press generally views Prokes and Andel's faction 
as the probable victor at the Zilina congress. The trade union 
daily PRACA sees Meciar as the ultimate winner in the scenario, 
sweeping the political base out from under his enemy Cernak. 
  The opposition paper SLOVENSKY DENNIK said Cernak's apparent 
strategy of keeping the SNS united by entering into the 
coalition while at the same time trying to remain independent of 
Meciar's political whims had been wishful thinking and a 
political illusion.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Sopoci: "What Will a Year Bring?"] </F>
  [Text] According to many a political observer, this year 
the crystallization of our political scene in the form of the 
"definitive" incorporation of the "broad-spectrum" Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] is to become a decisive factor. In 
the face of increasing "unification" of the activities of the 
chairman of the HZDS and his most faithful followers, the 
disintegration of this movement continues, and many politicians 
from the opposition parties have long since counted on it. Some 
of them connect their ambitions regarding the taking over of 
political power with this disintegration; some of them promise 
themselves primarily the augmentation and the strengthening of 
their ranks by defectors from V. Meciar, who are part of the 
stream having similar political orientations. Of course, they 
also connect this with the subsequent increase in support on the 
part of those citizens who, as they figure, will also shift over 
to the camp of their supporters. Such ambitions, for example, 
are not being concealed by the AD SR [Alliance of Slovak 
Democrats], the Zalovo wing of the SDSS [Social Democratic Party 
in Slovakia], and other political entities. 
  I believe that, even if such an "inclination" among possible 
defectors from the HZDS were to come about, this would not 
necessarily automatically result in a gain for these parties or 
an improvement in their standings. It is not even clear whether 
these renegades might not represent almost a burden for them. It 
should be remembered, for example, that the press was very 
critical of the politicians of the AD SR for having several 
times changed their party shirts and for exerting harsh 
criticism today of their former allies and friends, but mostly 
it should be recalled that the attitude of the majority of our 
citizenry with respect to such politicians is similarly critical 
and even repudiative. And even the Slovak citizenry, much like 
some of the Slovak politicians, is clearly and gradually 
maturing politically. 
  A look at our most recent history, in which citizens 
gradually, on a massive scale and very definitively, rejected 
several political teams that failed to fulfill their 
expectations, can be instructive. Currently, the citizenry is 
beginning to ever more reject the government of the HZDS (and 
part of the SNS [Slovak National Party]) and all that which is 
somehow connected with it. Political stigmatization, which was 
fanned and utilized by all of our post-November governments, has 
become a firm part of our sociopolitical reality and has, as 
always, first acted to benefit the holders of power and, 
subsequently, worked to their disadvantage. For example, much 
like some time ago, the political labeling of opponents acted to 
the benefit of the HZDS (ranging from those favoring the VPN 
[Public Against Violence] to being called members of the StB 
[secret police], and ranging through being labeled as followers 
of "clerical powers"); today, the majority of our citizens react 
negatively to the label "Meciar follower" or "former Meciar 
follower." 
  Clearly, all of our politicians are well aware of this 
"stigmatization effect," but not all of them take it into 
account equally. Some long ago closed the gates of their parties 
against stigmatized politicians (stigmatized as a result of 
political excesses and political collaboration) and some, 
especially those who have no other choice, are willing to 
continue accepting them. But it seems that those political 
parties that are attempting to profile themselves as being 
definitive or even choosy are experiencing a long-term rise. 
This year will clearly show whether this is part of the 
developmental trend moving from the image of a political scene 
determined by "broad-spectrum movements," "broad streams," etc., 
toward a scene that is replete with clearly defined and rankable 
political parties on the basis of European criteria. Slovakia 
would truly deserve such.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skalsky: "Slovaks on the Opposite Bank </F>
of the Morava River"] 
  [Text] According to the 1991 census, virtually 315,000 
Slovaks are living in the Czech Republic, which represents more 
than 3 percent of the total number of inhabitants. On 1 January 
1993, these people awoke to a special morning. They were 
compelled to choose one of various possibilities: to become a 
foreigner where they have lived for years and where they do not 
feel like foreigners or to apply for Czech citizenship and then 
travel to visit their parents as foreigners. Problems involving 
health and social insurance, social security insurance, very 
limited possibilities to engage in business, the loss of the 
right to participate in coupon privatization, the inability to 
exchange Czech currency within the Czech Republic for Slovak 
currency before undertaking a journey, and, mostly, the constant 
feeling of insecurity--these were the pressures under which 
local Slovaks had to make decisions and continue to make 
decisions. Moreover, many are determined to keep their Slovak 
citizenship. But not even the second of the possible decisions 
means that they would not espouse Slovakia or forget about their 
roots. 
  For many years, Prague has had the House of Slovak Culture 
(DSK) and the affiliated club. The Club of Slovak Culture (KSK) 
unites those who favor Slovak culture in Prague and its 
environs. The club has more than 2,000 members, more than half 
of whom are Czechs. No matter how meritorious the activities of 
this association were and are, in the cultural field its aims 
fell far short of satisfying all the needs of the local Slovaks. 
  And so, at the end of 1992 and the beginning of 1993, 
several 
additional Slovak activities came into being. The first to 
develop was the Community of Slovaks (OS), an apolitical 
association that was established as early as October 1992, at 
first in Prague, and, subsequently, following lively interest in 
other regions, it expanded its activities over all of the 
territory of the Czech Republic. Its first congress, which took 
place not quite two months following the division of the CSFR, 
was attended by more than 200 delegates. Today, there are 
already four regional OS organizations in Prague, Brno, Karlovy 
Vary, and Kladno. At Karvina, the organization wants to join the 
Community Association of Parents and Friends of the local Slovak 
basic school--the only one of its kind in the Czech Republic. 
Preparatory committees are also at work and in Tabor or Benesov. 
Today, the Community of Slovaks has about 400 members, and the 
number of sympathizers is approximately 2,000. Its activities 
are coordinated by a three-year presidium, headed by the 
journalist Nada Vokusova. 
  Significant popularity was also shown, primarily in the 
Czech-language press, to two other organizations: the Democratic 
Alliance of Slovaks (DAS) of director Fera Fenic and the 
Association of Slovaks (ZS) of the former delegate to the 
Federal Assembly, Jan Mlynarik. Both have several common 
features: According to their leading representatives, they plan 
to transform themselves into rightist political parties, the 
listed numbers of their members did not exceed 20, and they 
engage in no activities outside the city of Prague. However, 
publicity is provided by contacts in Czech journalist and 
political circles on the one hand, as well as being a result of 
their expressly anti-Slovak attitude. In addition, there exist 
several other Slovak activities, which are, however, already 
specifically focused--an example can be the Historical Group of 
Participants in the Slovak National Uprising or the Slovak 
Evangelical Church in the Czech Republic. The Slovak minority is 
officially represented by three Slovak members of the Council 
for Nationalities at the level of the Czech Government--one each 
from OS, the KSK, and DAS. 
  In May 1993, the Community of Slovaks began to publish the 
first Slovak periodical in the Czech Republic, with the title of 
DZAVOT. Seven issues appeared of this 12-page monthly. Its title 
was intended to symbolize that the Slovak minority in the Czech 
Republic is still learning to act from this position it holds, 
that it still must get accustomed to formulating its positions 
and needs clearly. Because the creators of this periodical 
judged that the Czech Slovaks have already overcome this period, 
the periodical will change its appearance and title in 1994: The 
colored cover, including 24 pages, will bear the title KORENE 
[ROOTS]. 
  The Government of the Czech Republic was reluctant to 
subsidize the periodical DZAVOT, as is customary with all local 
minority periodicals. The Matica Slovak cultural organization 
and other Slovak institutions helped out. The situation suddenly 
changed when DAS came up with the project for a monthly 
SLOVENSKE LISTY. SLOVENSKE LISTY received 1.2 million (to 
finance three issues!), and even DZAVOT came in for some 
crumbs--378,000. For 1994, to formally finance virtually 
identical projects, approval has been received for 2 million or 
rather 800,000 korunas. SLOVENSKE LISTY has profiled itself 
unequivocally as a political periodical that does not deal with 
problems experienced by Slovaks in the Czech Republic, and these 
people do not even contribute articles to it. From among the 
authors of the periodical, it is sufficient to identify only 
Ivan Miklos, Fedor Gal, Milan Zitny, and Miroslav Kusy. And so, 
the Czech Government, under the pretext of supporting minority 
publications, is financing an opposition Slovak political 
periodical. Such a destruction of bridges over the Morava River 
is not in the interest of those whom the DAS allegedly desires 
to represent. 
  The Community of Slovaks has been successful in initiating 
even a Slovak-language broadcast over Czech Radio--a 10-minute 
news broadcast each day plus a one-hour program once a week. 
However, Slovak activities have only a minimal opportunity to 
influence the content of this broadcast. The Community of 
Slovaks has protested this several times, but, for the present, 
without results. 
  With the end of 1993, the House of Slovak Culture, which has 
provided occasional asylum for all of the above-mentioned 
associations, as well as sponsoring their joint meetings, under 
the slogan of "Forums of Slovak Activities," was supposed to 
close down. Although the embassy is supposed to establish a 
Slovak cultural and information center in the same building, 
this will take some time. So the largest minority in the Czech 
Republic and the third-largest community of Slovaks abroad 
anywhere (following Canada and the United States) finds itself 
in an extremely unenviable situation. But I believe that the 
Slovaks on the opposite banks of the Morava River have already 
definitely decided what to do--they will not capitulate.

<F P=106> [Article by R.V.: "Jansa Waging War Again"] </F>
  [Text] Janez Jansa and Slovenia's Defense Ministry have 
announced that they will lodge a complaint or have already 
lodged a complaint with the competent court against several 
journalists because of a series of articles in MLADINA of 
Ljubljana. The accused include Svetlana Vasovic-Mekina, VREME 
correspondent and MLADINA staff member. 
  The reference is to articles which on the basis of secret 
documents obtained and testimony of participants exposed 
violation of the embargo, arms smuggling, misappropriation of 
military housing and unlawful treatment of former officers of 
the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army]. The journalists are charged 
with "insulting accusations" (under Article 108 of the Slovene 
Punitive Code, which is a variation of the once notorious 
Article 133). 
  Meanwhile, things are not really going as well as they might 
for the Defense Ministry in similar current trials. Following a 
series of articles in MLADINA about the illegality of certain 
moves made by the Defense Ministry (entry and confiscation of 
the apartment of Gen. Hocevar, former commander of the Slovene 
TO [Territorial Defense]), Gen. Hocevar's son filed suit before 
the competent court in Ljubljana and just the other day obtained 
a final verdict ordering the Defense Ministry to return the 
apartment and restore it to its original condition and pay the 
court costs. Thus it will probably be hard for the Defense 
Ministry to prove before those same courts that the newspaper 
articles about these and similar unlawful acts are "insulting 
accusations." 
  The announcement of the Defense Ministry that it will file a 
complaint against the journalists Igor Mekina and Svetlana 
Vasovic-Mekina for an interview with Sefket Suljevic, more 
precisely, for words uttered by Suljevic in that published 
interview, is an interesting precedent, one that was unknown 
even in the "leaden times of the communist SFRY [Socialist 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]." 
  Jansa is reproaching his former colleagues because of the 
shocking account of Sefket Suljevic, former captain in the KOS 
[counterintelligence service] in the Ribnica garrison, who in 
the course of a 10-day battle in June 1991, following an appeal 
from the Slovene Presidency, went over to the side of the TO, 
but immediately thereafter, according to his own account, was 
arrested, imprisoned, beaten, deceived and deported from the 
newborn state. The stateless Suljevic also revealed in the 
MLADINA interview that gentlemen "from some new military 
intelligence service" visited him at his temporary address in 
Vienna, where he has been given asylum, and promised that they 
would take care of his citizenship and passport for him without 
problems (so that he could return to Slovenia, where his wife 
and two children live), but all of this was on condition that he 
use his former acquaintances in KOS, who are now working in the 
present military intelligence service, "to obtain documents that 
in any way compromise Milan Kucan or Janez Drnovsek." 
  Suljevic's story in the last issue of MLADINA, which 
indicates that he saved Ribnica near Kocevje from heavy 
shelling, and also the very act of surrender in order to go over 
to the TO, have also been confirmed by certain quite 
distinguished people from Ribnica. Now it is up to "Slovenia as 
a law-governed state." Both in the case of Suljevic and also in 
the case of the accused journalists.

<F P=106> [Article by Tanja Staric: "Charges Raised Against Gaspari </F>
and Puhar"] 
  [Text] Ljubljana -- The SLS [Slovene People's Party] and 
SDSS [Social Democratic Party of Slovenia] have rejected the 
SKD's [Slovene Christian Democrats] initiative to unite. 
Instead, they offer to form a new coalition based on the 
"positive legacy of the Demos [Democratic Opposition of 
Slovenia]." The Presidency of the Social Democrats states in its 
message that the coalition should fight against "corruption, 
legal anarchy, political repression, and restoration of 
neocommunism." The People's Party says in its statement that 
Slovenia has arrived at a "decisive crossroads" at a time when 
it is still able to resist a "pernicious economic policy." The 
SLS will file criminal charges against Finance Minister M. 
Gaspari, Labor Minister Jozica Puhar, and Director of the 
Development Fund U. Korze. A real political scandal was caused 
yesterday by Janez Jansa's offer to all dissatisfied members of 
the Democratic Party, Eco-Greens, and Socialists who do not want 
to merge with the Liberal Democrats, to join his party. 
Presidents I. Bavcar, P. Tancig, and V. Zakelj denounced this 
sort of "recruitment" as an "intolerable attempt to interfere 
directly in the relations among the merging parties on the one 
hand and the internal relations of the parties on the other 
hand."

resignation, that he has never surrendered a battle, and that he 
is not going to do it now. However, considering the present

emphasized yesterday that his supposed resignation is obviously 
a planted rumor since nobody had talked to him recently about a 
possible government reshuffling.

  [Text] Ljubljana -- Vojka Ravbar, state secretary for 
foreign economic relations, met yesterday with Scharnhorst 
Mueller, director of the German Federal Ministry of Economic 
Affairs, who visited Ljubljana for the 20th anniversary of 
cooperation between the LHB Internationale Handelsbank and the 
Ljubljana Bank. Mueller also met with other officials of the 
Ministry of Economic Relations and Development. 
  Mueller and Ravbar favorably assessed Slovene-German 
cooperation. Slovenia has a positive trade balance with Germany, 
which certainly proves that the German market is open to 
Slovenia. Another sign is the well developed cooperation in the 
area of investments, which will increase in the future. Mueller 
said that Germany will continue to support Slovenia in its 
efforts to join the European Union. Ravbar cited Slovenia's 
efforts to become a member of GATT. She proposed that Germany 
help Slovene enterprises participate in German conferences and 
seminars dealing with strategies and opportunities for 
improvement and development of various economic sectors.

<F P=106> [Article by Manka Kremensek: "How Much Foreign Capital Is in </F>
Slovenia?"] 
  [Excerpt] Ljubljana -- [passage omitted] Germany, Austria, 
and Italy are the main foreign investors in Slovene businesses, 
accounting for 65.9 percent of all foreign capital investments, 
or 81.6 percent of their value. Investors from other countries, 
such as the United States, are not too interested, as seen from 
the table below. 
  It is hard to obtain statistics on the origin offoreign 
capital, where it is invested, and the amounts. The Ministry of 
Foreign Relations and Development has collected such data. It 
must protect business interests, however, and does not want to 
release the information. 
  However, it is known that there is substantial foreign 
capital investment in some businesses, e.g., Austrian capital 
has a 51-percent share of Henkel-Zlatorog in Maribor; in the 
tobacco factory in Ljubljana, German capital has a 56-percent 
and French capital an 18-percent share; the paper manufacturer 
in Kolicevo is 94 percent capitalized by Italians; and Uniteh in 
Skofja Loka is 51 percent capitalized by Austrians. 
  Slovenia is in great need of foreign investors, and it is in 
the country's interest to attract as many as possible. Of 
course, at the same time it must protect its national interests. 
  The adopted strategy should strive to attract foreign 
investors while at the same time protecting areas that are of 
national importance. A passive policy toward foreign investment 
means that we miss the opportunity to direct foreign capital 
into those economic sectors which need it most right now.

security in Macedonia is a condition for the containment of the 
conflict in the Balkans and beyond, and on the basis of 
commitments of the international community in this area, the 
People's Democratic Party, represented for the first time in the 
parliament of the FYROM, with the aim of surmounting problems as 
quickly as possible, considers that it is legitimate to inform 
the CSCE of the following: 
  1. About 40 percent of the total population of Macedonia are 
ethnic Albanians (the official figure is 21 percent). 
  2. Ever since it gained its independence, this state has 
been 
operating as an ethnic state of only the Macedonian 
(Slavo-Macedonian) people in all segments of decisionmaking, 
both in the highest state institutions and in other institutions 
of the economy, culture, media, etc. 
  3. Albanian deputies are outnumbered and outvoted in the 
parliament of Macedonia since there is no consensual 
decisionmaking. This resulted in the approval of the 
Constitution and of many laws that placed the Albanian 
population in a discriminatory position, especially in the 
fields of education, culture, privatization of capital, the 
media, the status of citizens, etc. 
  The government is completely centralized and concentrated 
into central organs while, in reality, there is no local 
government. 
  5. In cities in which Albanians are the majority population, 
the administration intentionally complicates the procedures for 
getting simple documents. A person has to wait for weeks to get 
a birth certificate. 
  6. The law on citizenship in Macedonia proclaimed about 
100,000 Albanians as stateless persons, through no fault of 
their own, by applying the condition of 15 years of 
uninterrupted residence in the country as a basic condition for 
citizenship. 
  7. The last elections were discriminatory. For example, the 
electoral constituency of an Albanian deputy had an average of 
8,000 voters while the constituency of a Macedonian deputy had 
4,000 voters. Now they are intending to hold new elections with 
only cosmetic changes of the same laws. 
  8. Albanians are not allowed to have their mother tongue as 
the language of instruction in higher education, while only 2.8 
percent of the Albanians are studying in Macedonian 
universities, where Macedonian is the language of instruction. 
  9. The structures of the central and local government and of 
the judiciary are ethnically pure or have token Albanians, while 
more than 300 Albanian lawyers in Macedonia are looking for work. 
  10. An Albanian party (the Party for Democratic Prosperity) 
took part in the coalition government with five ministers out of 
a desire to contribute to correcting the situation, but it was 
determined that the Republic of Macedonia just used them as 
window dressing for the international community. This failure 
caused serious problems for the party and it split into two 
parts. This radicalism is to the advantage of all. 
  11. The present government blames the lack of changes on the 
Macedonian radicalism of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian 
Unity] party (the ethnic Macedonian party). But the government 
did not mobilize the resources under its control to change the 
anti-Albanian attitude. 
  12. The present government blames the previous government 
for 
fact that Albanians are not included in the government 
structures, but this does not explain why the new areas which 
are being established in this country, such as diplomacy, 
continue to be set up on a single-nationality basis. 
  Many findings have been presented in the reports of various 
international and governmental associations, including the 
report to the 50th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights 
which was held in mid-February of this year. 
  Therefore, we think that it is a juridical, moral, and 
humanitarian necessity for this issue to be considered as one of 
the primary issues for the maintenance of peace and security in 
the region. 
  The People's Democratic Party believes that conditions 
should 
be set for the admission of Macedonia to the CSCE; that is, the 
FYROM Government should be obliged to enter into principled 
political discussions with the Albanian side through the 
intermediary of the CSCE, for the purpose of creating 
constitutional-juridical conditions for the achievement of real 
ethnic equality in the FYROM", says the Position Statement of 
the Leadership of the People's Democratic Party which was sent 
to the Ministerial Council of the CSCE in Prague.

<F P=106> [Interview with Borko Stanoevski, governor of the National </F>
Bank of Macedonia, by Vasko Eftov and Vesna M. Bozinovska; place 
and date not given: "Balancing Between the Government's Course 
and the Banks"] 
  [Text] Our conversation with Borko Stanoevski, 
governor of the NBM [National Bank of Macedonia (The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM)] takes place as calls 
for his replacement ahead of schedule are becoming louder. 
Allegedly, his stubborn attitude toward certain questions has 
not won him great sympathy among certain members of the 
government. And while competition in the press about the names 
of his possible successors has already become intense, Mr. 
Stanoevski, in his interview with VECER, begins to speak 
sincerely about these controversial issues. 
  [VECER] Mr. Stanoevski, it is precisely in the monetary 
sphere that there have been open questions about the 
negotiations with the World Bank that took place last week in 
Skopje. Were the ambiguities clarified during the somewhat 
delayed visit of Minister Trpevski to Washington? 
  [Stanoevski] During the negotiations with the World Bank, 
the 
particular problem was voiced because of their demand that we be 
very restrictive with respect to further loans to enterprises 
that are not liquidated. Naturally, they have demanded that the 
government or the NBM through its processes relieve the banks of 
that burden and issue a regulation through which they would be 
prohibited from issuing credit to enterprises that are not able 
to meet their obligations. This issue was also present to a 
great extent in dicussions with the IMF. I, personally, 
discussed the matter with the chief of the mission who was here 
and convinced him that this demand was unacceptable. 
<H5>  Monetary Disagreements </H5>
  [VECER] Was the disagreement precisely the reason the 
negotiations were abandoned at one point? 
  [Stanoevski] I did not abandon them; I have never abandoned 
any negotiations. But, on one occasion, we reached the point at 
which, instead of increasing the investment by as much as 21 
percent, they proposed a reduction of six percent. We could not 
accept that and proposed another solution. The increase in the 
investments of the resources of the banks could go up to 16 
percent; the fact that we were unable to go to a variant growth 
in the investments so that they would amount to 21 percent was 
that the entire program could not be brought before the Board of 
Directors, so we agreed that this should not be a criterion for 
fulfilling the program. We documented our doubts that, because 
of the fact that a large number of enterprises were in 
particularly difficult circumstances, that instrument could not 
be put into effect. We agreed to consult a second time, in the 
second quarter of this year, on the basis on the results that 
would be achieved during the first three months. 
  The World Bank suddenly demanded that we refuse to offer 
credits to enterprises that have great losses, but those are 
enterprises with a great number of workers; some 20 enterprises 
have suffered 90 percent of the losses and have about 40 percent 
of the employees in the economy. For the state, that would be 
very difficult to accept, and a compromise solution was found. 
It was approved by us and the government. A group of the 25 
largest losing enterprises will, after presenting concluding 
accounts, be able to use credits from the banks thereafter, but 
only if the government guarantees them. But this arrangement is 
valid only until 30 June, and after that date the enterprises 
will be able to use credits only if they are creditworthy. At 
the beginning, the World Bank wanted such a decision to be made 
by the NBM, even though I think that the NBM does not have the 
authority to introduce such a regulation. Now, it is necessary 
for the government to do it, and the NBM assumes the obligation 
in the second quarter from the possible growth of denar 
investments, which amount to 608 million denars, to ensure 300 
million denars to be used only by these enterprises. We will 
devote the remaining 308 million denars to the use of the 
remaining enterprises. The NBM will issue that regulation. 
Otherwise, as far as the methods for granting credit to the 
greatest losers up to 30 June, the government held a special 
session at which each of its members had to declare whether he 
was prepared to accept that obligation. 
  [VECER] January 15 will be remembered as the date on which 
the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund met 
and the program had to be verified. But could that deadline not 
be extended somehow? 
  [Stanoevski] No, the IMF and World Bank boards did not set 
the date in advance. According to the latest information, the 
meeting of the IMF Board of Directors was set for yesterday. I 
think that the program will pass without difficulty because we 
succeeded in reaching an agreement about these details in the 
past few days. On 8 February, the World Bank board will meet, 
and I think that there will not be any problem there, either. 
  [VECER] It means that the positions on our side are also in 
agreement. How is it that we found out on Wednesday that you had 
a meeting with Prime Minister Crvenkovski and other ministers 
who are involved in the work? 
  [Stanoevski] Everything is in agreement, there are no open 
questions. All the technical problems associated with providing 
resources, for getting through, and settling obligations toward 
the bank should be completed by the middle of next month, which 
will be followed by withdrawals against the first tranches. 
  [VECER] Will we pay off the debt ourselves or will there be 
an alternative whereby Holland or the Central Bank in Zurich 
will do it first, and then we would settle with them? 
  [Stanoevski] It will be a combination. The main debt, which 
reaches its deadline for payment at the end of September and 
amounts to about $107 million, should be paid at once through 
the bank for transfer to the account in Zurich and in 
conjunction with the Netherlands Central Bank. Later, we will 
settle the debt to them either with resources from donors or 
from our reserves. Otherwise, up to now, about $27 million has 
been agreed upon by the donors, part of which has been paid in 
advance and part of which awaits decisions by the governments of 
those countries. Those are the percentages. At the present time, 
the donors' assistance will be about $35 million, but the 
process of acquiring the donors' assistance will be extended 
throughout the entire year. 
  [VECER] Will the Soros credit be left out of the 
combination? 
  [Stanoevski] No, the Soros Foundation is not left out of the 
combination. Thereafter, to survive, we will incur debts of $25 
million, if everything is passed by our parliament, of course. 
<H5>  Expanded Independence </H5>
  [VECER] Since May last year, the Central Bank has gained 
greater autonomy in its activities, above all vis-a-vis the 
government. How do you evaluate such a loosening trend? 
  [Stanoevski] You see, the Central Bank is quasi autonomous 
in 
its activities, which is a consequence of the Constitution of 
the Republic of Macedonia. As far as its work is concerned, the 
bank is basically responsible to the parliament. However, in the 
true meaning of the word--autonomy--an independent central bank 
does not exist anywhere in the world, as the bank directs 
monetary policy which is only one segment of the macroeconomic 
policy of a state, which is proposed, enacted, and carried out 
by the government. Here, it means that a very close, 
coexistential, and routine cooperation must exist. In that 
context, it is understood that there can often be disagreements. 
However, there are frequent discussions about the extent to 
which a measure, from the aspect of monetary policy, is 
acceptable to the government. 
  [VECER] Is there an unwritten rule about how much the 
Central 
Bank is independent in its work, and how much the government 
wants to focus attention on itself? 
  [Stanoevski] Perhaps there is some truth in that. I do not 
know how to approach that question. You should ask the 
government that. 
  [VECER] Last spring, the legal decisions needed by the 
National Bank to enable the Central Bank to gain a greater 
degree of autonomy in its activities vis-a-vis the state organs 
had great difficulty in getting passed. It is even said that the 
government accepted the measures under pressure from the IMF. It 
is also interesting--this metamorphosis of the leadership of the 
NBM from our conservative attitudes with respect to the monetary 
sovereignty of Macedonia to the hard work, at least under our 
circumstances, of taking radical steps for the greater 
independence of the Central Bank. 
  [Stanoevski] We have not been conservative when the issue of 
monetary independence arose, even though to a foreigner it may 
have appeared that way. You know, 1991 was a very exceptional 
year. In the parliament, those preliminary steps were taken; for 
three or four months, we had no elected government; the priority 
was to get decisions with political substance.... Actually, that 
year, not a single item from the economic sphere came before the 
parliament. 
  [VECER] Okay. Do you treat monetary independence only as an 
economic problem? 
  [Stanoevski] It is a multifaceted problem. In 1991 we made 
good use of 11 percent of the emission from the National Bank of 
Yugoslavia, even though according to the size of the social 
product, we could have exploited at most 5.5 percent and bought 
currency reserves from the National Bank of Yugoslavia to the 
magnitude of 197 million dollars, and that is 17.5 percent of 
the total currency sold by the National Bank of Yugoslavia for 
that year. We did not buy that much currency in the three 
previous years. That year, Macedonia was swimming in gasoline, 
so we began building currency reserves. 
  [VECER] In what way did the government transgress in order 
to 
accept the measures for greater independence of the Central Bank 
last spring, even though the members of the cabinet of Mr. 
Crvenkovski did not in the end agree with such an alternative? 
  [Stanoevski] No, they did not agree; they were just 
indecisive. I tell you frankly that we were also hesitant. I 
endured great apprehension over the changes. Imagine, we, who, 
for 50 years were on a fixed course, suddenly had to change to a 
course determined by the market. Generally speaking, it was not 
simple. Meanwhile, I must say here that, at the beginning, there 
were still many progressives in the government who supported 
this program. We had a much greater misunderstanding outside the 
government--in the Economic Chamber and in other institutions 
which showed greater skepticism. 
<H5>  Communication With the Government </H5>
  [VECER] How are your relations with the government? It is 
said that your stubborn attitude on that specific issue did not 
find you great sympathy among particular government ministers, 
above all, those directly responsible for the economy. 
  [Stanoevski] No, we have already talked about that, about 
the 
opposing interests, which are known. 
  [VECER] Yes, but we did not talk about the misunderstandings 
that have been reported about interest rate policy last year. 
  [Stanoevski] Okay, we have discussed interest rates. The 
government adopted some recommendations and resolutions about 
interest rate policy which were created here. Together, we 
estimated that the interest rate policy of the commercial banks 
in the first half of last year was not set realistically. The 
economy rightly rebelled against the high interest rates. We 
discussed this problem at the Bank's Council, and the government 
also discussed it at its own special session. We came up with 
identical decisions: we charged the banks with re-examining 
their interest rate policies. 
  [VECER] You say that the government discussed the interest 
rate policy at its session. Why should the government discuss 
the interest rate policy when it is the responsibility of the 
NBM? Is that not just interference by meddlers? 
  [Stanoevski] No, the government discussed it under pressure 
from the chamber and from a group of economic leaders who 
demanded an audience with the government. Otherwise, the 
interest policy of the commercial banks is not within the 
competence of either the NBM or the government. 
  [VECER] Is it true that the Central Bank does not have any 
difficulty in carrying out the inadequate interest rate policy 
in the commercial banks without anyone taking administrative 
measures against it? 
  [Stanoevski] We do not have any legal basis for such 
administrative measures. 
  [VECER] Don't you think that the NBM, however, should be 
able 
to regulate interest rate policy with administrative measures? 
Countries like the U.S. until 1986 or Spain until 1987 fixed 
interest rates in the commercial banks using administrative 
means, didn't they? 
  [Stanoevski] Okay, I agree that there should be some 
measures. However, the measures should be based on indirect 
means, through monetary policy measures in order to cut interest 
rates. And we will try to do that above all through auctions. 
  [VECER] Were you on the same wave length as the government 
when it was a matter of the financial reorganization of the 
banks, especially with respect to the formation of an agency for 
the financial reorganization of the banks? 
  [Stanoevski] Here we had a small problem. Now, there is no 
kind of agreement. There were two theses. We all agreed that an 
agency for the financial reorganization of the banks should be 
formed--as an institution which would be professionally charged 
with that work, and not, as it has been up to now, by necessity. 
Debatably, it was completely a technical question. Should all 
the technical work for the agency be conducted by the bank? What 
should be meant by that--technical and administrative work? No 
one defined it. Such a decision, for a particular short period, 
was used in Slovenia, but it was emphasized that it should be 
duplicated in our law. Our opinion was that it should be an 
independent government agency. And, in the end, our 
interpretation was accepted. On the contrary, let's say, the 
director of the agency, in a way, would also be a director of a 
detached sector in the Central Bank. I could not accept that. 
With that, the independence of a working unit would be 
statutorily established having two masters. On the one hand, the 
council and the government, and on the other, a managing council 
of some agency. It is a good thing that there was, in the end, 
someone who thought that it should remain as it was. 
  [VECER] Was the law taken out or returned in the assembly's 
procedure? 
  [Stanoevski] The law was not taken from the procedure; it 
was 
incorrectly introduced. Simply, before the law entered the 
procedure, we agreed with the leader of the government that a 
controversial article would be expunged. Moreover, Bekir Zuta 
incorrectly accepted it and transferred it to the ministry [not 
further identified] which took the law out of the procedure. 
When we saw what had been done, we immediately corrected the 
error and returned the law to the procedure. 
  [VECER] How much do the state reserves amount to currently? 
  [Stanoevski] At the moment, there are about $122 million, 
but 
that is subject to very rapid change with respect to the fact 
that the obligations to the World Bank should now be paid. The 
largest share of the currency reserves has been acquired through 
exchange transactions. We ended 1992 with about $66 million in 
currency reserves, but now, you see, they have increased by 
about $60 million, of which $50 million was derived from 
exchange transactions, but the rest is from abroad. Actually, we 
sold more abroad through the currency market than we bought. 
<H5>  (Non)Immunity of the Policy </H5>
  [VECER] Does politics interfere with the work of the bank? 
Now, an election of three deputy governors is imminent. Saban 
Prevala is a representative of the Party for Democratic 
Prosperity, Dusanka Hristova is a member of the presidency of 
the Liberal Party, and Dr. Gligor Bisev has been called up to 
now an independent. 
  [Stanoevski] You see, before the end of last year, we were 
left without a deputy governor. In accordance with my dutiee, I 
am charged with suggesting the election of deputy governors and 
of an acting governor. Considering that for me, as governor, it 
was the president of the republic who named me and who can 
dismiss me, I first acquainted him with the problem. We examined 
two possible options. The matter could be left until the 
election of the next governor, or it could be resolved now in 
order for the people to ensure continuity and to assume a 
portion of the governor's duties. Parliament selects them, and, 
in the final analysis, they are responsible to the Assembly and 
not just to me as governor. We agreed, however, that it would be 
better not to wait for the expiration of my term, but rather to 
propose deputy governors. 
  [VECER] We hear that there are some problems with the rules 
concerning their appointment? 
  [Stanoevski] Well, until yesterday, until the withdrawal of 
the proposal from the agenda, I thought that there were no 
problems of any kind. Where things stand now, I have not been 
informed. In the public media, I read that this was tied to my 
replacement, and that the nomination of the new governor and the 
election of the new deputy governors should be postponed for a 
while. 
  [VECER] When will your term expire? Do you have the right to 
campaign for a second term? 
  [Stanoevski] I cannot campaign for myself. It is up to the 
president of the republic to offer a nomination. My term expires 
on 19 October this year. 
  [VECER] To what extent is there a possibility for you to be 
governor of the National Bank for a second time? 
  [Stanoevski] That would depend upon many circumstances. And, 
it is most likely that, at that time, it would be possible for 
me to say whether I would be a candidate. Above all, it depends 
on who will be president of the republic and what kind of 
composition the government will have. 
  [VECER] When your term expires, the president of the 
republic 
and the composition of the government will certainly be the 
same, considering that the elections will probably be even later. 
  [Stanoevski] I do not know whether, in the last month of 
their work, the parliamentarians will debate the selection of a 
new governor. It is most likely that would leave me in place 
after the expiration of my term, provided of course, that I wait 
through the end of the term, and another few months as acting 
governor. Consequently, if they want to replace me, they should 
do so now. 
  [VECER] In our conversation, you continually stress--if I 
wait through the end of the term. Do you really feel such strong 
pressure to resign? 
  [Stanoevski] No. I have experienced absolutely no such 
pressure. But recently the press has begun to write about that. 
  [VECER] And just how much power does the press have? 
Certainly, it cannot replace you? 
  [Stanoevski] No, it certainly won't replace me. I trust the 
press, and I trust that you now have exact data and do not 
fabricate things. You probably know something now that I do not. 
  [VECER] They say, when all kinds of stories begin to 
circulate about a certain person in political life, then 
certainly they are trying to suggest something to him. What is 
suggested to you by the stories that you have a private bank? 
  [Stanoevski] I have not heard these stories. Unfortunately, 
I 
do not have any kind of bank, and I do not have even one denar 
of stock in any kind of bank. My wife is in one bank, in the 
Credit Bank, and probably that is the grounds for the stories. 
For me, it is an unfulfilled dream to have my own bank, but I 
cannot get the capital since I do not have 150,000 marks. 
  [VECER] Much earlier, you changed the law which strengthened 
the limits for opening savings accounts. Previously, other 
things being equal, would it have been easier for you to open a 
savings account? 
  [Stanoevski] If I made a mistake, I made it earlier, four or 
five years ago, in the former Yugoslavia. I should have formed a 
bank then. 
<H5>  Scandals </H5>
  [VECER] Speaking about private banks and savings accounts, 
is 
it possible for us to have a scandal along the lines of those of 
"Dafiment Bank" or "Jugoskandik Bank?" 
  [Stanoevski] As far as I know, a scandal has already arisen. 
It concerns a savings account which called itself a branch of 
some Belgian bank. It promised credits up to 60,000 German marks 
with a hypothetical deal with which it collected a lot of 
resources from citizens and suddenly disappeared. Another case, 
and a much bigger scandal, involves the situation with 
"Jugomarket Stedilnica" savings bank. As a result, we made a 
decision that the license of that bank should be revoked. The 
consequences are known: They will not work either as a bank or 
as a savings institution; they will go bankrupt, and the 
deposits will be settled by the bankruptcy court. 
  [VECER] What's going on with "Karic Bank?" 
  [Stanoevski] "Karic Bank" of Belgrade has a business branch 
in Skopje which was in compliance with the provisional rules of 
the law on banks as it then existed. But, as such, it was not 
under the control of the NBM. I spoke with the owners of "Karic 
Bank" and they were categorical that not a single depositor 
would lose money, either interest or principal. I promised them 
assistance and that I would discuss with some of our banks 
giving them denar credits on the basis of the hard currency 
deposits and that the NBM would not treat these deposits in 
accordance with the bank's hard currency policy. Thus, we would 
make an exception in the interest of the citizens. 
  [VECER] To what extent do you work with the Bank for Foreign 
Trade? 
  [Stanoevski] In my opinion, the Bank for Foreign Trade has 
not carried out the procedures for separating itself from the 
former "Jugobanka" in the most felicitous manner. That is why, 
from the very beginning of its operations, it encountered 
liquidity problems. Toward the end of last year, the liquidity 
of the bank reached a critical point for paying into the savings 
accounts of citizens, as guaranteed by the NBM, and they began 
to draw on the resources of the central bank. At that point, we 
issued a ruling which prohibited them from using this money for 
other purposes while drawing the resources for the savings 
accounts. This prohibition lasted only 15 days. Later, we 
replaced this ruling with another one which stipulated certain 
measures to overcome the problem. In three months, we will 
decide whether the bank should enter the restructuring process. 
  [VECER] Have the ambiguities regarding the business balance 
between "Komercijalna" and "Stopanska" banks been fully 
clarified? 
  [Stanoevski] No. The business balance was not fully 
completed, and I think that the entire work should be finished 
much quicker. The two banks should themselves work out a mutual 
agreement. It would be wrong for the "Komercijalna" Bank to 
think that it has extricated itself from this. There will be 
problems. For example, the "Stopanska" Bank could take advantage 
of some unfair practices. The World Bank, the IMF, and the other 
international financial institutions should be informed that the 
dispute between the two banks has not ended. 
  [VECER] And in conclusion, the competition for new 
Macedonian 
bank notes has ended. How far has work progressed? 
  [Stanoevski] The competition has ended, but the decisions on 
the bids have been reviewed by a specially formed group which is 
under the auspices of the National Bank and on which artistic, 
scholarly, and financial experts collaborate. In accordance with 
their suggestions, we agreed to make a contract with the winning 
contestant, Biljana Unkovska, who now lives in Slovenia. She is 
to prepare six bank notes with figures and six bank notes with 
other symbols from our cultural and national heritage. When 
these are ready, we will decide which design to accept.

<F P=106> [Article by G.M.: "Seselj Does Not Believe in the Economic </F>
Program"] 
  [Text] Leader of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] Vojislav 
Seselj, Vice President Toma Nikolic, youngest Deputy in the 
Assembly of Serbia Stevo Dragisic, and President of the SRS of 
the republic of Srpska Rade Leskovac confirmed once again their 
position toward the present government at a promotional meeting, 
the first of its kind, in Brus: 
  "We supported the ruling party as long as its policy did not 
become dangerous for the economy of the country, which is 
leading the citizens to poverty. We did not want to participate 
in it, and especially we did not want to take part in putting 
pressure on the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serbian 
Krajina to accept the ultimatum and renounce the fulfillment of 
their goals," Seselj stressed. 
  Speaking about the Program of Monetary Reform, Seselj 
stressed that he did not believe it would be possible to 
implement it in the way it is being done now. "I believe that 
the monetary reform will not survive beyond the harvest," SRS 
leader said. 
  During his presentation, someone interrupted Vojislav Seselj 
several times. After two casual warnings, Seselj threatened the 
unknown person with the following words: "Calm down or get out, 
otherwise I will personally come to throw you out of the room." 
The person was not heard again.

<F P=106> [Article by STA's Belgrade correspondent: "Janez Drnovsek </F>
Too?"] 
  [Text] Generals Veljko Kadijevic and Blagoje Adzic 
are supposed to be the ones most guilty for the JNA's [Yugoslav 
People's Army's] withdrawal from Slovenia. 
  There is specific evidence that Branko Kostic, Borisav 
Jovic, 
Jugoslav Kontic, and Sejdo Bajramovic did not prevent the 
adoption of the decision on the JNA's withdrawal from Slovenia, 
and that they did not declare martial law or a state of 
emergency and adopt a decision on general mobilization on 12 
September 1991. For these and other reasons, Djordje Dozet, a 
Belgrade military court judge, is proposing to the military 
prosecutor of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] army's 
General Staff that appropriate measures be taken against the 
members of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia] Presidency, according to STA's Belgrade 
correspondent. 
  Judge Dozet, who has the rank of captain, is actually 
demanding a trial of the entire former SFRY Presidency, i.e., 
also Stipe Mesic, Janez Drnovsek, Vasil Tupurkovski, and Bogic 
Bogocevic [as published], namely because in March 1991 they 
rejected a proposal from Federal Secretary for National Defense 
Veljko Kadijevic to declare a state of emergency and because in 
July 1991 they adopted the decision on the JNA's withdrawal from 
Slovenia, and thus recognized its secession. 
  Dozet is primarily accusing Generals Veljko Kadijevic and 
Blagoje Adzic because they did not prevent the SFRY Presidency's 
decisions on the JNA's withdrawal from Slovenia and on the 
release of 5,000 soldiers from the September draft, and because 
they did not order JNA attacks against Croatia's paramilitary 
units. The list of the accused also includes Generals Zivota 
Avramovic, Andrija Raseta, and Dobrasin Parasevic, who among 
other things are supposed to have been responsible for turning 
over the equipment of the military hospitals in Zagreb and 
Ljubljana to the secessionist republics' authorities. 
  Some circles in Serbia and Montenegro, especially military 
ones, still cannot reconcile themselves to the fact that the 
SFRY no longer exists. An answer to the question of why there is 
one trial after another in the FRY of officers for the military 
defeats of Greater-Serbian policy would be interesting. The 
answer is more than simple: obviously someone has to be blamed, 
especially now that the Serbian policy is facing its most real 
danger to date--the NATO alliance's ultimatum. It is easiest to 
make long-retired generals and members of the former SFRY 
Presidency, one of whom is already deceased and four of whom are 
not within reach of the judges and prosecutors in Belgrade, the 
scapegoats. 
  It is actually not very likely that the military prosecutor 
of the Yugoslav army's General Staff will respond to Dozet's 
proposal. The Supreme Military Court, just a few days ago, 
annulled the verdict of the Belgrade military court on the basis 
of which five officers from the JNA's Varazdin Corps were 
acquitted of surrendering their units and turning over enormous 
amounts of weapons to the Croats. 
  The judicial proceedings against the Varazdin Five, of whom 
General Vlado Trifunovic was supposedly the most responsible, 
have been dragging on for more than a year, and it seems that 
they still will not end soon. They are also interesting because 
the above-mentioned five people were acquitted precisely by 
Judge Djordje Dozet, who presided over the Belgrade military 
court at the trial. The Supreme Court annulled his verdict 
acquitting them on the basis of testimony by Generals Zivota 
Avramovic and Veljko Kadijevic, according to STA's Belgrade 
correspondent.

<F P=106> [Interview with President of the Democratic Party Zoran </F>
Djidjic by Uros Komlenovic; place and date not given: "Eight 
Hours With Karadzic"] 
  [Excerpt] The visit of the delegation of the 
Democratic Party to Pale on the occasion of the recently 
prepared "festive expectation" of the outcome of the NATO 
ultimatum, spurred various comments in Belgrade: Praise could be 
heard, as well as criticism that what is at issue is a "cheap 
collection of political points." Zoran Djindjic, president of 
the Democratic Party, confirms in talks with VREME that the 
development of events in Bosnia directly influenced his decision 
to travel to Pale. 
  [Djindjic] We had an agreement in principle even earlier to 
discuss with the leaders of the republic of Srpska the forming 
of the Democratic Party in this territory. When the ultimatum 
was declared, it seemed to us natural to go to Pale and thus 
express our solidarity with the people in the republic of Srpska. 
  [Komlenovic] How was your idea on the founding of the party 
accepted in Pale, and what else was discussed? 
  [Djindjic] We agreed not to found the party until the war is 
over. We agreed that the forming of a real political party in 
the territory of the republic of Srpska at this moment could 
mean disloyal competition with the Serbian Democric Party [SDS] 
along with the danger of creating confusion among the members of 
this organization, which, because of the conditions under which 
it operates, resembles more a blend of a national movement and 
the state administration than a political party. In addition to 
this, we discussed the future government system and relations 
between political parties in Serbia and the government 
leadership of the republic of Srpska. We wanted to introduce a 
little relaxation in relations and bring into question the 
monopoly of the Socialist Party of Serbia in relation to the 
Serbs in Bosnia, which, it seems to me, is suffocating them 
somewhat. Anyhow, if the SDS were a political party in the 
traditional sense, I do not believe that it would be close to 
the Socialist Party of Serbia -- communist and socialist ideas 
are not popular among the people of the republic of Srpska. On 
the other hand, the mention of the republic of Srpska spurs 
nonconfidence in some opposition circles in Belgrade. We want to 
establish correct relations with the SDS and to lay a foundation 
for our future cooperation. 
  [Komlenovic] The leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan 
Karadzic, did not miss a single opportunity to express 
unreserved support for Milosevic on the eve of the elections, in 
spite of frequent attempts by the opposition to ingratiate 
themselves with him -- it is sufficient to mention the support 
of the Democratic Party of Serbia when the Vance-Owen plan was 
rejected or Seselj's aid in suppressing the military uprising in 
Banja Luka. Have you seen any additional reliable indication 
that Pale's views on the political scene in Serbia may be 
changing? 
  [Djindjic] I think that something is changing. Before the 
last elections the leadership of the SDS and the republic of 
Srpska did not explicitly support the SPS. The support of Serbs 
from Bosnia was up to now addressed to Milosevic as a candidate 
for the president of Serbia and not to his party. The problem is 
that many opppsition parties in the republic of Srpska have the 
reputation of being unpatriotic. We wanted to destroy exactly 
this thesis and show that radical demagogy and crude language 
are not a proof of patriotism, that national interests can 
successfully be protected by the policy of peace, and that the 
division into "patriotic" and "unpatriotic" parties is not 
justified. There are no unpatriotic parties in Serbia. Anyhow, 
we differ both in our presentation and party mentality from the 
political organizations which had previously been coming to 
visit the republic of Srpska, but our interlocutors (we talked 
with Mr. Karadzic and 15 people from the political and military 
leadership) told us that no one has been received as well as out 
delegation thus far. Eight hours of conversation in a single day 
must mean something. 
  [Komlenovic] It is increasingly heard in public that the 
diplomatic action in connection with the NATO ultimatum and the 
withdrawal of the Serbian artillery from positions around 
Sarajevo, represent, in fact, Milosevic's defeat. Is it also 
your impression that Karadzic has slowly started to become 
independent in relation to Milosevic? 
  [Djindjic] Of course. Maybe this should not be interpreted 
as 
a Milosevic's defeat but as a process of maturation: The 
republic of Srpska does not need a guardian. The greater the 
pressure of Milosevic and the FRY on the Bosnian Serbs, the 
greater the pressure of the international community on the 
parent state. Thus, by making Milosevic and Yugoslavia move away 
from their present diplomatic positions, the need for additional 
pressure on the Serbs will decrease and the economic blockade 
will become meaningless, which is good. It would be best if 
Milosevic would declare that he is withdrawing from the Geneva 
peace negotiations. Thus, it would be clearly shown that 
Yugoslavia is not involved in the conflict in Bosnia and that 
the republic of Srpska can represent its interests alone. 
  [Komlenovic] At the beginning you said that you spoke with 
Radovan Karadzic on the future setup of the state. Whose state? 
  [Djindjic] We agreed that the republic of Srpska should be 
joined to Serbia. A transitional solution should be found, and 
everything should be carried out with the consent of the 
international community, which I think will not oppose this 
option if peace is concluded. Thus, we talked about the future 
setup of the joint state, which should not be burdened with the 
ideological dogmas of socialist bureaucracy. Our common 
assessment is that this state should be parliamentary and 
democratic. I emphasize that we would be more moderate than our 
interlocutors as regards the time frame for changing the 
ideology. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Momcilo Cebalovic: "Two Consortia for One Gas </F>
Line (2): Work for Stockholders Only"--first paragraph is 
POLITIKA introduction] 
  [Text] The Russian partner will not finance the 
gasification of Serbia until the sanctions are lifted; the new 
consortium acknowledges the work of the old one, and money 
previously invested by NIS [Petroleum Industry of Serbia] will 
be included as an investment in the future joint-stock company; 
the Pojate-Nis-Dimitrovgrad branch of the gas line will be a 
joint-stock company; significance of the branch from 
Bulgaria. 
  The blockade against our country has halted many projects, 
including the gasification of Serbia south of Batajnica, which 
has been dragging on for 10 years now. The biggest problem has 
always been the lack of money. The question now is whether 
Serbia will solve these problems as well, since there are two 
consortia for the gasification of southeastern Serbia. The job 
will probably be undertaken by the one with the stronger 
political position in these times. 
  Only three days before the last elections, on 16 December, a 
meeting took place at Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's 
office between Mirko Marjanovic, the general director of 
"Progres," and Stepan Romanovich Derezhev and Vladislav 
Vladimirovich Pochinkin, the directors of "Gasprom" in Moscow. 
The official announcement said that these men are 
representatives of a consortium to construct the southern branch 
of the gas line across Serbia. In the presence of the president 
as well as Prime Minister Sainovic, it was reported that "a 
contract was signed concerning this major job." Speaking of 
former Prime Minister Sainovic, it must be noted that he has 
long been acquainted with the cooperation between "Progres" and 
"Gasprom." It is perhaps partially for that reason that insiders 
say that he will be the FRY ambassador to Moscow. 
  The founders of the consortium, at least according to the 
Serbian Government accord signed by Sainovic, are the mixed 
Russo-Serbian enterprise "Progresgas-trejding," Belgrade, as 
well as NIS, "SARTID 1913," and "Beobank," so that it was 
logical to expect that these members would put their signatures 
on the contract concerning joint financing and construction of 
the gas line through which gas would one day arrive not only 
from Hungary, but also from Bulgaria. But since the members of 
the consortium existed only "on paper," without any mutually 
arranged relations, without any agreement to govern this, it was 
normal that only two "serious" firms would then emerge, which 
are in fact the foundation of this consortium: "Progres" and 
"Gasprom." 
<H5>  Priority to Mixed Enterprise </H5>
  Even that information about Russian financing of the Serbian 
gas line under the blockade elicited reactions by IZVESTIYA, and 
it was explained in Moscow that this job will get under way only 
after the sanctions are lifted. A month ago, we too looked for 
someone at "Progresgas-trejding" to explain this, but Toplica 
Nedeljkovic, one of the directors of the mixed company, 
considered it a bad time for anything to be written about that. 
Thanks to Mirko Marjanovic, the general director of "Progres," 
we spoke to "Progresgas-trejding" about the new consortium only 
a few days ago. We asked Filip Grujic, the assistant general 
director of "Progres," and Toplica Nedeljkovic, the director of 
"Progresgas-trejding," what has happened over the course of the 
month and a half since the contract was signed in President 
Milosevic's office. 
  They explained to us that the goal of creating the 
consortium 
is to gasify that part of Serbia and to ensure an alternative 
and supplemental path of entry for gas, at Dimitrovgrad, in 
addition to the existing one at Horgos. According to the 
government accord, the job coordinator is "Progresgas-trejding." 
<H5>  $190 Million From Stockholders?! </H5>
  "We are a Russo-Serbian mixed enterprise, there will be 
Russians involved in the job, so it is logical that we be the 
exponents of the job," says Nedeljkovic, who before assuming 
this post was in fact an assistant to Nikola Sainovic, then the 
minister of energy at the very time when "Progres" was 
intervening to cover the debts of importers and users of gas by 
exporting our goods. At the time, "Progres's" entry into the gas 
business created conflicts with NIS, but some sort of 
compromise, about which nothing can be written at present, was 
found to the satisfaction of all. 
  The role of the founders is to create the conditions for 
realization of the job in the first phase. That would mean 
finding money, providing projects.... The readiness of the 
Russian firm to come in with money is not disputed. Will that be 
only money, or equipment and labor as well? The people at 
"Progresgas-trejding" with whom we spoke do not deny that an 
investment program has been drawn up within NIS (while they do 
not mention "Energogas, although it is known that it is behind 
this), and that they have plenty of necessary projects (for the 
Pojate-Nis-Dimitrovgrad line) from which the new consortium will 
profit. Thus, they will also need what the old consortium, which 
is still in existence, produced. The task of the new consortium 
is to construct the line in question from Pojate to 
Dimitrovgrad, as well as the Nis-Knjazevac-Bor-Prahovo, 
Nis-Leskovac-Vranje, and Nis-Prokuplje-Kursumlija-Pristina 
lines. It is estimated that between $180 and $190 million is 
needed for all these lines. 
  We would add that "NIS Energogas" knows nothing about these 
talks that you have had with NIS. 
  "That is a relationship problem at NIS," says Nedeljkovic. 
  "We are planning," Grujic continues, "to build the gas lines 
with investments from future stockholders, who will be the 
co-owners of the gas lines, who will run them and have the right 
to share the profits that we expect. We intend to create a new 
enterprise whose job will be the operation of the gas lines 
constructed with stockholder investments." 
  Can this principle also apply perhaps to the long-distance 
hot-water line from the thermoelectric power plant in Obrenovac 
to Belgrade? 
  "Certainly. If that had been done, the job would have 
already 
progressed quite far," Grujic replies. 
<H5>  Whoever Provides the Money Gets the Work </H5>
  The officials with whom we spoke emphasize that firms that 
are not among the founders but that accept the principles will 
be allowed to join the project. It has been agreed that 
everything that NIS has invested thus far in these lines will be 
recognized as an investment in the new enterprise. For example, 
the planner will be the same. Incomplete investments made within 
the NIS context concerning gas will be completed by those who 
began them. Our consortium will not interfere in this regard, 
they say. They emphasize that "there is no controversy in 
relation to the existing consortium. They themselves can finish 
what they have begun, and if someone from that consortium wants 
to participate in this one, they can join it." 
  "No one can be guaranteed work unless they provide money," 
says Grujic, in response to complaints from firms in Nis who are 
afraid of losing business. If they do not have the money to 
invest, then they can invest their labor as future co-ownership. 
  The capacity of this branch from Bulgaria is two billion 
cubic meters of gas annually. Around seven billion cubic meters 
can enter each year from the Hungarian line. This would allow 
for a normal supply until 2011. However, Nedeljkovic says that 
we have never taken more than 2.5 billion cubic meters from the 
Hungarian line (plus a billion cubic meters of domestic gas). 
Thus, with this branch, if there is enough consumption and users 
that can pay for the gas in this country, it will be possible to 
import around nine billion cubic meters annually. This branch 
would close the "gas line ring" and reduce the dependence on 
petroleum derivatives (and increase the dependence on imported 
gas).... Gas is cheaper than petroleum, Grujic and Nedeljkovic 
emphasize, stressing that the possibility of a "goods for gas" 
arrangement is very great. Conditions will also be created for 
getting gas to Montenegro one day. 
  Have the founders signed any mutual agreement that would 
lend 
legal status to the consortium? 
  "The principles have been agreed to, and an agreement is 
being drawn up," says Toplica Nedeljkovic.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Nedeljkovic: "Credit Awaiting Deposits"] </F>
  [Text] There is no possibility of credit without 
significant savings by citizens. Beobanka is the first bank to 
offer real estate loans, but few people can pay the high 
interest rates. To grant farm loans, Agrobank requires deposits 
or share purchases. 
<H5>  Strong Dinar -- Expensive Credit </H5>
  The expected revival of credit activity is much slower than 
expected. Zika Urosevic, chief of the Credit Department in 
Agrobank, notes that "there cannot be credit without deposits. 
It is true that we are not lending money yet, but we will start 
for certain no later than one week from today. However, the 
question is who can get credit as long as we require deposits or 
share purchases." 
  In Agrobank, for the time being they only indicate that 
their 
business policy will also make provisions for loans to farmers, 
but only under the previously mentioned condition: cash deposits 
or share purchases. For the time being, the possibility of using 
the former hard currency savings is not being considered. 
  Dragoljub Vukosavljevic, president of Union Bank, points out 
that "the only person who can get a loan is someone who has 
money, but such a person does not need to borrow money. Banks 
have no money; thus, more active lending can be expected only 
after the revival of savings activity. Still, the question is 
how to regain savers' confidence." 
  Many banks are waiting for their annual meetings to define 
their business policies and specify the requirements for credit. 
In Privredna Bank in Belgrade, they believe they will regain the 
savers' confidence because they have already paid off almost 
one-half of the old hard currency savings. 
  Milovan Kvrgic, director of Privredna Bank in Belgrade, says 
that "there is no saving and therefore no credit without savers' 
confidence. Objectively observed, banks have no source of money 
for lending until saving is revived both in hard currency and in 
convertible dinars. What will probably help us is the fact that 
we practically never stopped paying off the old hard currency 
savings accounts." 
  The Beobanka Bank has published the requirements for all 
types of credit. Particularly important for individuals is the 
possibility of real estate loans. However, these loans are 
available only to those who can make a deposit equal to 50 
percent of the loan value with annual interest of 7 percent. 
Loan terms are 20 years for purchase of an apartment and 10 
years for home improvements. However, the early figures show 
that only a few people will be able to meet the requirements of 
either deposit or interest rates, which amount to 1,000 dinars 
per month for a two-bedroom apartment of 60 square meters. 
  The expectation entertained by potential borrowers that 
banks 
are going to offer a large spectrum of loans is not realistic. 
The little money the commercial banks will allocate for loans 
will be used very sparingly. No comparison to any previous 
period would be realistic. The present situation is considerably 
less favorable despite the fact that we have a solid dinar. Some 
bankers even say, with a light touch of cynicism, that the dinar 
is expensive and difficult to borrow mainly because it is 
strong.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] An article on page 16 of the 3 March 
issue of the Belgrade daily POLITIKA reports that a new 
automatic telephone exchange has been installed in Vukovar 
"reconnecting this part of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] 
to the world." In addition to a number of telephone lines in 
some areas of Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Srem that had been 
linked to the telephone exchanges of Novi Sad, Sombor, and Sid 
in Serbia's Vojvodina province, in the next 20 days the most 
remote villages of the Vukovar municipalities will be linked to 
the automatic system, and in the next two to three months 
telephone exchanges of villages in the Dalj, Tenja, and Mirkovci 
municipalities will be plugged into the Vukovar main telephone 
exchange, POLITIKA states. 
  The paper cites Spasoje Popovic, director of the Post, 
Telephone, and Telegraph [PTT] Public Enterprise for Slavonia, 
Baranja, and Western Srem, as stating that the PTT will 
recognize all the rights of previous subscribers in the 
territory of the former Croatia, under the condition that they 
prove that they owned the telephone before the war. Popovic 
notes that, during negotiations to establish telephone links 
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and the 
Republic of Croatia, the Croatian representatives had demanded 
that the territory of the republic of Serbian Krajina be 
included in the Croatian telecommunications system, with the 
prewar area code of 056, which would have meant that the RSK was 
an integral part of the Republic of Croatia. This was not 
accepted, Popovic says, adding that the telephone connections of 
the RSK will remain in the FRY telecommunications system. Thus, 
the RSK and the FRY, as a single system, will establish their 
telephone links with Croatia via Croatia's country code number 
99385, the POLITIKA article concludes.

<F P=106> [Article by R.P.: "Television and the Military Court"] </F>
  [Text] Radio Television of Serbia [RTS] has refused to 
broadcast free of charge during prime time an advertisement to 
popularize the Yugoslav Army, i.e. to recruit young men to be 
trained at military academies and military high schools. 
  At first glance one could say there is nothing controversial 
about this; every advertisment has to be paid for; television 
cannot waste its valuable time and does not have to make 
exceptions. Anyway, one second of prime time for an ad costs, 
depending on the program, an average of 50 dinars. 
  However, RTS did broadcast the military ads for a certain 
period of time. It is true that it aired the ads during programs 
that do not have a large number of viewers, such as "Dozvolite" 
[Allow Me] and "Srbija Danas" [Serbia Today], but then it 
decided not to show them anymore. While large television 
stations decided to take this step, the small ones continued to 
air the ads. Free of charge, of course. 
  The Montenegrin and all the local Belgrade television 
stations agreed to run the ads free of charge. It is said in the 
army that POLITIKA TV and Studio B were the first to respond: 
They understood the situation of the Yugoslav Army. As soon as 
the request by General Momcilo Perisic arrived, they agreed to 
provide several spots daily, although the financial status of 
these television stations is not particularly good. 
  On the other hand, the state television did not yield to the 
army's request to have a few seconds alloted for the armed 
forces even though the airing of the ads on military schools is 
of public interest. 
  The army has calculated that it would have to pay 50,000 
dinars (German marks) to state television for it to agree to 
broadcast the ad on four RTS channels, and this only for a few 
days. 
  Of course, such a sum was simply shocking to the Army, which 
asked the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] 
to do something through his "connections." 
  FRY President Zoran Lilic made a request to RTS, but even 
this did not help.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Radovanovic: "The Turnkey and the Fortress"] </F>
  [Text] Now that the Serbian Government has controlled 
Radio-TV Serbia for three years, the opposition will try to 
right things by turning back the clock a bit. According to the 
bills on the Radio-TV which DEPOS [Democratic Movement of 
Serbia] and the SRS [Serbian Radical Party] have prepared, each 
on its own, the Assembly would reassume power over operation of 
television --from Appointment of the general director to 
definition of programming policy. 
  According to the case made by the Radicals and DEPOS, 
television would thereby cease to be a one-party institution, 
and its pluralization would automatically terminate the 
influence which the Socialists have at the moment on the shape 
of TV programs. "We are in a big hurry," says Zarko Korac of the 
Citizens Alliance [GS], explaining that the reasons for this lie 
in precisely what television is showing and that the solutions 
proposed, again because of the hurry, can be referred to as 
"initial and transitional." 
<H5>  The Bills </H5>
  One of the differences between the two opposition bills lies 
in the institution of the programming committee, an idea that is 
backed in DEPOS; it would have 20 members (half from among 
people's deputies and the other half made up of figures in 
science, culture and public life, along with three members from 
Radio-TV). The principal tasks of the programming committee, as 
seen by the people from DEPOS, would be to appoint editors in 
chief and managing editors, to establish overall radio and 
television policy and to set down the rules for presentation of 
party programs and candidates over radio and television during 
the election campaign. 
  In their bill the Radicals assign these functions to the 
managing board, and both parties envisage the institution of an 
oversight committee, which is also quite well-known already. The 
Radicals try to solve the problem of the general director by 
having him chosen after each election, and DEPOS with a 
provision prohibiting him from any participation in a body of 
government or in the parliament itself (Milorad Vucelic, the 
present general director, heads the caucus of the SPS [Socialist 
Party of Serbia] in the Serbian Assembly). 
  The Radicals and DEPOS differ in the way they solve the 
problem of allocation of radio frequencies. In the DEPOS version 
this function would also be assigned to the Assembly, that is, 
to a committee which it chooses, while the Radicals would leave 
the question of frequencies to the Government, which would 
allocate them according to criteria proposed in the Radical Law 
on Radio-Television. To be sure, the Government will also 
operate through a commission, but the influence of the Assembly 
would be that the Committee for Culture and Information would 
nominate to the Government candidates for membership on the 
commission. In addition to the attempt to solve the problem 
which is obviously the main one for the opposition -- 
television, in DEPOS they have gone a step further and also 
drafted a proposed Law on Information. The most important thing 
in that bill is that it envisages the existence of several, not 
just one, newspaper organization and the institution of the 
ombudsman. According to the conception, the ombudsman would be a 
single official elected by the Assembly and nominated by the 
relevant committee of the Assembly, and his principal task would 
be to protect the public's right to know. 
  He would be chosen from among the ranks of experts in 
communication science, law and journalism; he would work 
independently (in response to complaints and requests of legal 
entities and individuals), and his decisions would be binding on 
those in positions of responsibility. 
  Aside from the purely mathematical problem that would arise 
if the parties do not dovetail their bills and if they should 
get in a situation where they cannot get a sufficient number of 
votes for them, there are several other stumbling blocks for 
everything the Radicals and DEPOS have conceived. 
  "Neither of the bills really gets to a mastodon like 
Radio-TV 
Serbia, nor do they establish new rules of the game," says 
Professor Dragor Hiber, himself a member of the GS, and he adds: 
"If the idea is to change one master for another, then that is a 
bad idea, and in addition it is condemned to failure for the 
simple reason that the opposition does not have the votes to get 
it through the parliament." 
<H5>  Defects </H5>
  Professor Hiber believes that it makes no difference which 
majority party has a decisive influence on television, remarking 
that experience (both our own and abroad) indicates that at some 
point that influence can be cemented into place. Worst of all, 
once that happens, television and the person who controls it 
have every opportunity to help one another in preventing any 
change whatsoever. 
  The problem which Professor Hiber mentions pertains to 
literally everything which the Radicals and DEPOS have conceived 
in their bills. All the good intentions will depend, that is, on 
the one who has the majority in the Assembly, so that what could 
easily happen in the future is that one of the figures of 
Radio-TV Serbia, hated by the opposition, might become the 
"fair-minded ombudsman," and the programming or oversight 
committee of television would go on doing the same things as the 
oversight committee for monitoring the election. 
  The opposition, then, omitted to concern itself with the 
most 
important thing in this entire tale -- establishing clear rules 
of the game that would not depend on the momentary balance of 
power in the parliament and that would prevent all the 
well-known evils familiar to us, from bribery to blackmail. 
  Neither of the sponsors has any explanation for this 
omission 
other than haste. The main issues have been left for some time 
in the future, when presumably there would be less haste and 
less fear of the "TV Bastille." At the moment the most important 
thing for the opposition is to change at least the turnkey in 
the ill-famed fortress. 
  In Professor Hiber's opinion, there is a mistake even in 
that 
notion, since it could easily happen that the opposition's bill, 
if it should pass the Assembly, would be struck down in the 
Constitutional Court. "The constitution, which calls for a 
separation of powers, sees the Assembly concerning itself with 
general enactments, not individual enactments, while the DEPOS 
bill envisages a number of individual enactments through 
commissions that would concern themselves with particular 
matters, which is certainly unconstitutional." 
<H5>  The Ground in Between </H5>
  Acknowledging that these bills nevertheless represent 
"transitional solutions," Dragor Hiber also said that the most 
important thing would be to take away from Radio-TV Serbia its 
undeserved title to the infrastructure (transmitters and 
frequencies -- the Radical bill contains something like that) 
and then to compel it to concern itself with its own 
programming, in which it would be subject to strict rules. 
  The laws of the market (in obtaining frequencies) and those 
same rules of the game envisaged by law in creating programming 
that would apply to government television ought to apply to the 
other, nongovernmental, television stations, which on this 
occasion were not a concern of either the Radicals or DEPOS, 
which left them in some middle ground not regulated by anything, 
according to Professor Hiber. The Radicals, it is true, envisage 
certain rules for allocating and taking away radio frequencies, 
but even that concept breaks down as soon as one moves on to the 
parts of the bill concerned with government television. The 
essence of even their bill lies in minuscule limitation of the 
influence of the Socialists today -- that is, in taking control 
tomorrow if they get in power.

<F P=106> [Article by Slobodan Djukic: "Drop the Hammer, Pick Up the </F>
Sickle"] 
  [Text] Niteks, a textile factory in Serbia, is prepared to 
pay its excess employees 36 months of wages to leave their jobs 
and return to the countryside or open a private business. Niteks 
has about 1,500 employees; some 500 of them are underemployed. 
  Approximately 1 million people, white collar and blue collar 
workers, are supposed to lose their jobs throughout Serbia soon. 
The new economic program foresees that about 200,000 of them 
will return to farms. Many other Serbian companies are trying to 
convince their work forces, which migrated from the countryside 
to the cities, to exchange their hammers for a sickle. The 
management of the Smederevo ironworks, a huge investment, is 
trying to motivate its workers to cultivate edible forest 
plants. The Crvena Zastava automobile factory in Kragujevac is 
planning to open a farming center. 
  However, it seems that it will be difficult to persuade 
people to return to the countryside. The state program could be 
enforced only by using repressive measures and massive layoffs. 
It is questionable whether these people are really ready to 
return to the countryside; some of them have no place to which 
to return. People have migrated to the cities because they have 
found city life more comfortable, with more job and education 
opportunities. Now they feel shortchanged on all counts; they 
have lost their work, they are pressured to return to the 
village, they cannot send their children to school. It is hard 
to expect that all the problems will be solved with economic 
measures. Will the proponents of such a policy be forced to 
resort to violence, as was the case in China during the Cultural 
Revolution or as the Pol Pot regime [in Cambodia] did when it 
forcibly relocated the population, abolished the use of money, 
and established cooperatives?

<F P=106> [Article by Biserka Dumic: "Loans Only for `Sound' Programs"] </F>
  [Text] The dinar has gotten to its feet, and now the second 
phase can begin -- invigoration of production -- which is the 
foundation of the stabilization program, Dr. Dragoslav 
Avramovic, professor, said recently. How many loans have the 
banks granted to a dead industry since introduction of the 
Avram, what problems are they encountering, and is there a 
chance of the "rusty wheel" starting up and gathering speed in 
the foreseeable future? 
  Under the new market-oriented conditions, one gets the 
impression, the banks are ready to extend loans exclusively to 
sound production. Production which will yield an assured profit, 
and they have no intention of using their money to revive 
losers. Meanwhile, the big question is how many producers will 
manage to obtain enough credit to get their machines going and 
at the same time sell their products. 
  For Zastava alone, one of our largest factories, for 
instance, it will take bank support amounting to at least 3 
million German marks or new dinars per month, and that 
represents between 30 and 40 million super dinars annually. From 
what certain daily newspapers are writing, the announcements now 
coming from that giant are that this month "there will be 
nothing" coming from the assembly line for precisely that reason. 
<H5>  A Real Rate of Interest at Last </H5>
  Unfortunately, there are quite a few giants like that in the 
country. Factories at Rakovica in Belgrade are waiting for loans 
like a thirsty man waiting for water, but even if they get them, 
the question is who they will sell the tractors and other 
machinery to, so that they can repay the money. They cannot 
export them abroad, at least for the present, and the peasants 
are holding onto their money in order to buy petroleum products, 
seed, fertilizer.... 
  To invigorate production in the large factories, there is no 
doubt, the government and the banks will need a great deal more 
money than they themselves have at this moment, and it is 
uncertain when the sanctions will be removed and when we will 
again get foreign loans. Nevertheless, commercial banks here 
have already begun to invest money in production. This is not 
enough for a beginning, but things have nevertheless begun to 
move. 
  Since early January the mixed PKB [Beograd Agroindustrial 
Combine] Bank has loaned about 9,000 billion old dinars and more 
than 700,000 new dinars to support production. Seventy percent 
of that credit was invested in agriculture, and the bank mainly 
enters into joint investments with creditors. 
  Nenad Urosevic, general director of the PKB Bank, who 
mentioned first of all that the banks must operate on a profit 
basis, but an honest profit, also says that a real rate of 
interest has finally been introduced for the first time and must 
be at least 0.1 percent above the rise of retail prices. 
Otherwise it is inflationary. 
  "It is not true that the banks are obstructing the program. 
So far the producers have been putting up for sale goods from 
inventory only to the extent that they could market them. Now 
they must count on a real rate of interest, since otherwise the 
program will not succeed," Mr. Urosevic warned. 
  He added that people are not coming to the bank for credit, 
but for a loan. The bank in turn is seeking security in the form 
of collateral, and it wants repayment of the principal and 
interest within the period called for in the contract. When 
things are set up like that, no one will be operating at a loss, 
and there will not be any inflation. 
<H5>  All Credits Are Short-Term </H5>
  Union Bank has also begun to furnish credit to its 
customers, 
agricultural producers, although sizeable applications for 
credits are expected only in the months to come, when planting 
begins. 
  According to Milan Aleksic, director of funds and loans, 
730,000 dinars have so far been invested in the fattening of 
baby beef, production of equipment for the food manufacturers, 
and the purchase of production supplies. Another 200,000 dinars 
have been supplied to agriculture through interbank credits, 
that is, not directly, and applications are being examined for 
600,000 dinars in credit to finance the fattening of hogs, but 
also about half a million dinars for other types of production 
(wood manufacturing), and about 150,000 for fruit. In addition 
to all that, this bank is also furnishing customers guarantees 
so that they can import production supplies. 
  "All the credits are short-term, for one month with the 
option of extension at an interest rate margin of 1-4 percent 
per annum. The price of our capital is perhaps high, since bank 
costs are immense," Mr. Aleksic said, adding that producers, 
those who have taken credits, have not complained about the 
rates of interest, since they have the kind of production that 
will bring a profit. 
  From 24 January to 1 March Agrobanka approved about 
4,300,000 
dinars for spring farmwork, and more than 2,000,000 have been 
used. Slightly more than 3,000,000 dinars in credit have been 
granted to animal husbandry, of which about 2,500,000 dinars 
have been used. All in all, this bank has supplied about 
7,300,000 dinars in credit, and between 80 and 95 percent of 
this was for agriculture. 
<H5>  The Forgotten Cooperatives </H5>
  "The amount of credit approved is far less than agriculture 
needs," says Stanko Bugarcic, assistant director of the 
dinar-loan sector of Agrobanka. Nevertheless, this bank expects 
to be able to furnish about 25,000,000 dinars for spring 
farmwork. Interest rates have been set at two levels: 12 percent 
for primary production and 14 percent for other production. 
Asked whether these are real rates of interest, Mr. Bugarcic 
replied: "They are high for the borrowers, but for us they are 
low, in view of the situation the bank is in, since capital has 
melted away." 
  The decision on mandatory guidance of bank loans (published 
in SLUZBENI LIST [OFFICIAL GAZETTE] on 15 February), which 
prescribes how the banks are to behave, calls for credits to be 
committed to production, but nowhere were the agricultural 
cooperatives mentioned. "We went to the NBJ [National Bank of 
Yugoslavia] and demanded that the cooperatives be treated like 
any other production firm, since between 80 and 95 percent of 
agriculture is based on the agricultural cooperatives," Mr. 
Bugarcic said. 
  Vojvodjanska Banka has also begun to grant credits in new 
dinars, mainly for agriculture. So far, according to Mirko 
Tisma, deputy general director of the main headquarters in 
Belgrade, more than 10,000,000 dinars have been invested in food 
production. 
  All in all, the commercial banks are ready to invest sound 
capital only in sound projects. The time of primary note issue 
is behind us, and therefore so is the credit financing of firms 
so that they can meet their payrolls.

  [Text] In the vicinity of the village of Dubovo in the 
Kovin municipality, at the very edge of the Deliblatska Pescara 
[Sands], in an ecologically sound atmosphere, a new antibiotics 
factory of the Hemafarm Pharmaceutical Industry of Vrsac was 
opened today. Four million German marks have been invested in 
the factory's ultramodern equipment, not counting the cost of 
the basic adaptation and modification of the building which the 
Kovin municipality donated to Hemaform for this purpose. 
  Dr. Borivoje Antic, Serbian health minister, and Pavle 
Todorovic, Serbian minister for the protection of the 
environment, were present at the ceremony inaugurating the new 
factory in Dubovac. 
  Engineer Miodrag Babic, general director of Hemofarm, 
informed journalists that the factory will produce 100 million 
capsules or 3.8 million packages of high-quality antibiotics 
annually. Thanks to the most modern technology, 30 people will 
work here initially, in two shifts. 
  "Hemaform built this factory -- just as it did the natural 
medicines factory on 12,500 square meters in Vrsac -- under the 
difficult burden of international sanctions," Mr. Babic said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No Chance of Survival"] </F>
  [Text] A reporter for the Austrian economics journal 
INTERNATIONALE WIRTSCHAFT wrote in an article titled "Heroes Are 
Tired": Yugoslavia is committing slow suicide and Montenegro is 
dying with it. She describes the hopeless state of the 
Montenegrin economy. The author claims that, objectively 
speaking, the industry of the most loyal Serbian ally has no 
chance of survival following the dissolution of Yugoslavia. It 
not only lacks raw materials, it has been left without a market. 
The Montenegrin economy used to rest on three pillars -- its 
main sources of foreign currency: production of aluminum, 
maritime transport, and tourism. Before the war in Bosnia, 
Montenegro's merchant marine earned $150 million, as much as 
tourism. Sales of aluminum accounted for $155 million. All three 
economic sectors are virtually in ruins today. 
  The Montenegrin economy did not fare badly at the end of the 
1980's. The former Yugoslav republic produced 25 percent of 
Yugoslavia's quality steel and 50 percent of its aluminum. Of 
course, the aluminum combine in Podgorica as well as the iron 
works in Niksic have been operating at a loss in recent years. 
According to an assessment by an independent economist, Branko 
Vujosevic, they may be operating at only 20-percent capacity 
but, fearing labor unrest, the political leadership is afraid to 
close them. 
  The second pillar of the Montenegrin economy was the 
maritime 
industry. Montenegro had the largest concentration of ships per 
capita in Europe. Following the imposition of sanctions, most of 
them are now anchored. Tourism, which had the best chance of 
developing in Montenegro, has also been damaged by sanctions. 
Since 1991 there have been no foreign tourists, while before the 
war they accounted for 35 to 45 percents of all overnight 
guests. Montenegrins must now be content with Serbian and 
domestic guests. Macedonian tourists are counted as foreign 
guests although they do not bring foreign currency. 
  Since the introduction of UN sanctions against rump 
Yugoslavia, the Montenegrin food supply has depended entirely on 
Serbian good will. This was apparent last fall when trucks 
loaded with needed foodstuffs were not allowed to cross the 
Serbian-Montenegrin border at Prijepolje. The Serbian 
authorities suddenly demanded special permits. This internal 
trade embargo against the small Serbian partner was meant to be 
a disciplinary measure to preclude any thought of independence. 
  Montenegro -- like Serbia -- has horribly high inflation, 
and 
humble protests [against sanctions] by the leadership that 
Montenegro is an innocent victim are to no avail. The only thing 
that is still adequate in Montenegro is the supply of 
electricity, but this is also supposed to change thanks to the 
rapprochement between Croats and Serbs. It is supposed to be 
exported to Croatia for foreign currency.

  [Text] (HINA) Belgrade -- The "super yugodinar" has begun 
to lose its glow. Alarming news has arrived from Montenegro that 
the exchange rate in transactions between banks and businesses 
is one German mark to 1.5 dinars. 
  Since mostly Serbian firms have been involved in grey hard 
currency transactions, panic has spread in Montenegro that large 
amounts of hard- currency would be taken out of the country. 
Since the introduction of the new "yugodinar," the Albanians in 
Kosovo have disregarded the official exchange rate of one dinar 
to the German mark and demanded two to three dinars to one mark. 
  The spreading instability has raised the possibility of the 
beginning of an end to the economic stabilization program. 
Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic met hurriedly with the 
Serbian and Montenegrin prime ministers and Dragoslav Avramovic, 
architect of the program, who in the meantime had become 
governor of the National Bank. They have decided that the 
official exchange rate must be strictly enforced. They have also 
agreed that high prices for utilities and services present a 
threat to the anti-inflation measures and will therefore have to 
be reduced. 
  Avramovic has still faith that the new dinar, called the 
"avram," will maintain its value and that he will be able to 
resist the pressure to print more money. Some people suspect 
that the dinar has lost value because new money has been printed 
out of fear of strikes, including a strike by workers at an arms 
factory in Kragujevac. Street dealers, who for the time being 
are engaged in smuggling cigarettes, say that they will soon 
return to a more profitable business -- buying and selling 
foreign currency in the black market.

<F P=106> [Article by Miroslav Lazanski: "From Grbavica to the Serb </F>
Pentagon"] 
  [Text] An ordinary gray telephone on a small black table, a 
poor overheated room in a squat private house in the settlement 
called Grbavica in the Serbian section of Sarajevo. People are 
waiting patiently around the telephone to call their friends and 
relatives on the other side of the front, in the Muslim section 
of Sarajevo. The telephone represents life, hope and anxiety, 
and it is the only line for direct dialing of the number unless 
it has been changed or the line is down, and it is located in 
the room of the Exchange Commission. The lads in camouflage 
uniforms are also here: Rajko Sforcan, Slavisa Tusevljak and 
Dragan Divcic, all members of the commission. What dramas they 
have witnessed in these two years of war! How many human 
destinies have been recited in the room with the gray telephone 
on the little black shelf... 
  Grbavica and Vrace, which are Serb sections of Sarajevo, 
seem 
ghostly in the twilight. Broken windows, buildings riddled and 
wounded by shells and shrapnel, lights flickering behind drapes, 
a stray dog here and there, silence in which one can hear the 
whistle of the sniper bullet. 
  And in some parts of Sarajevo there are not only private 
bordellos, both voluntary and involuntary, and private prisons, 
but there are even private cemeteries. For 20 to 50 marks the 
professional killers will murder anyone, and to prove their 
rating as 'bad guys' they bury their victims in their own 
orderly private cemetery. It is an open and ongoing competition, 
and various Celos, Josos and Musos are masters of the life and 
death of innocent civilians. 
<H5>  The "Comanche" Bunker </H5>
  The Lukavica Garrison is a forward command post of the 
Sarajevo-Romanija Corps of the Army of the Srpska republic. Maj 
Gen Stanislav Galic, that corps's commander, lives here at a 
crowflight's distance of 400 meters from the Muslim positions on 
Mojmilo Hill, but that does not disturb him very much. His two 
bodyguards, military policemen, have the coldest miens the 
author of this article has seen on any battlefield in the world: 
neither smile nor grimace, no talk, no questions, no answers. 
Ice and only ice, so that the atmosphere becomes unpleasant. 
General Galic, fortunately, is a sociable fellow who knows what 
the media can do. Capt 1st Class Predrag Glusica, a mechanical 
engineer from Sarajevo who has spent three years living and 
working in Chicago, is also here as his officer for finance, 
physical inventories and supply. He is actually the financial 
genius of this corps, and he goes right to the first line of 
combat. 
  That front line has somehow been pushed into the background 
in the media, so that members of the crew of the Comanche Bunker 
on Zlatiste, that is, Babin Zub, emphasize that there is not a 
single regular army officer among the fighting men in that area; 
they are all reserve officers. Mladen Popovic, Novica Skrba, 
Dragisa Tusevljak, Vladimir Skrba, Milutin Trifkovic and Nevenko 
Divcic, members of the combat team of the Comanche Bunker, are 
only 50 meters from the Muslim positions. "We exchange shouts 
with the Muslims every day, both they and we have enough of war. 
Half an hour ago a Muslim came to have coffee with us. We 
invited him. Now he just keeps hanging around," the "Comanches" 
say. 
  The bunker was improvised from corrugated sheet metal, 
bricks, wood, small drums, earth and logs. Inside there is a tin 
heater, fire and moisture. Three beds, four chairs, automatic 
weapons and rifles with telescopic sights on the walls. Only the 
weapons are clean and shiny. 
  "We spend one day, all 24 hours, on position, the next day 
we 
go to nearby houses to rest," they say. They are all from 
Sarajevo or environs. What is the food like? Bad, couldn't be 
worse. "We have not seen meat for five months, nor, by God, have 
we seen our defense minister visiting the front lines. Our teeth 
are going bad, falling out, our vision is failing because of the 
poor diet, but what can you do, we know that this is war, and 
there is no other way." 
<H5>  A Serbian Pentagon Underground </H5>
  The "Comanches" squat in their bunker, the tin heater roars 
with the wet wood, the observers strain their eyes at the 
loopholes and ramparts, staring into the darkness. The dark 
vilayet of Bosnia... 
  Part of the 4th Battalion of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps is 
in a little wood a bit further on from Zlatiste. An elite unit 
of the Army of the Srpska republic. Its commander is Maj Radomir 
Kojic, height two meters, weight 95 kilograms. When he talks to 
the officers and men of the French battalion that is part of the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force], the French get an inferiority 
complex, since Maj Kojic is one of the best commandos of the 
Serbian army in Bosnia, a participant in the most difficult 
missions and operations, always in the front ranks. The French 
know that, and that is why they respect him. 
  To be sure, they have no choice, since they have come from 
hot Africa, from Chad, to icebound Jahorina, where Maj Kojic 
washes with snow, naked to the waist, and the French wear 
bulletproof vests even when they go to the toilet. As a matter 
of fact, as soon as it gets a bit 'thick,' the French flee to 
Kojic for his care and protection, and he receives them and 
looks at them as a snake does a frog.... At least for the 
present. 
  The deadline for the NATO ultimatum has passed, the Army of 
the Srpska republic is nevertheless still on the alert. False 
positions are being built, the real ones are being fortified. 
The UNPROFOR has already lodged an official protest because the 
Serbs are building false positions. 
  "It is up to you to distinguish the real ones from the false 
ones," the Serbian side replied. In this game of one-upmanship 
and electronic surveillance NATO is especially monitoring the 
activity of the general staff of the Serbian army, which has its 
central post in the hills of eastern Bosnia. This is actually an 
underground command complex that dates from the time of the 
former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], the army command post and 
headquarters for the Supreme Command of the former Yugoslavia in 
case of war. It is all underground, in the hills, resistant even 
to the shocks of atomic bombs up to 50 kilotons, everything is 
completely self-sufficient and automated. The people who live in 
that underground city can be out of touch with the outside world 
for as long as six months, that is the extent of their stocks of 
food, fuel and ammunition. 
  There is everything under the sun in that underground 
command 
post: dormitories, a kitchen, a mess hall, a storeroom, offices, 
an operations center, a meeting room, a hospital, sanitary 
facilities, a computer center, a tangle of corridors, steel 
doors operated hydraulically, special tunnels and camouflaged 
entrances, filters or ventilation and kilometers of cable and 
pipe. The systems of communications from this command center of 
the Army of the Srpska republic cannot be jammed unless the site 
is attacked with 50-kiloton atomic bombs. Communications have 
been interrupted twice, when the Serbian side was simulating a 
nuclear attack: on 7 August 1992, lasting 35 minutes, and on 16 
June 1993, lasting 15 minutes. Even the NATO experts were 
immediately wondering: Why has the Serbian Pentagon gone silent?

<F P=106> [Article by Dusan Kecman: "The Krajina Economy Is Surviving"] </F>
  [Text] Banja Luka, 4 Mar -- The Krajina economy is 
surviving, although on the average only one-fifth of the prewar 
capacity is in use. Surrounded by war, with a large portion of 
the labor force at the front, with sanctions, hyperinflation, 
and -- in the last two months, with no payments being made, a 
majority of the firms in Srpska republic (formerly Bosanksa 
Krajina) have been brought to a point where they are producing 
only just the amount of goods necessary to cover the payroll and 
maintain equipment, since by working more than that they are 
only producing losses. 
  Nevertheless, under these conditions, when all production 
has 
not been put on a war footing, and when a state of war has not 
been officially declared, the people of Srpska republic, like 
the Serbs in the West, accustomed as they are to troubles and 
various shocks, are not inert. On the contrary, businessmen are 
displaying awesome energy and resourcefulness. Raw materials are 
being procured in almost all parts of the world. The extent of 
their success in trade with the world is indicated by how well 
stores and open-air markets are stocked here, not just by the 
assortment of products in the economy. 
<H5>  Food Industry the Leader </H5>
  You can find everything in the stores here, from kiwis, 
bananas, oranges, and cherries to Italian furniture and Japanese 
television sets in all makes and sizes. Twice the output 
heretofore is expected in the first half of the year, when 
payments with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia resume. This 
was explained by Sveto Mudrenovic, president of the chamber of 
commerce. 
  "Our own hyperinflation and the explosion of inflation in 
the 
FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and the absence of payments 
for the last two months have been an obstacle to survival of the 
economy here. We expect that the resumption of payments with the 
FRY and the restraint of inflation will increase production by 
at least half of what it is at present and then an even larger 
growth," Mudrenovic says, explaining that the economy has 
survived in spite of the wartime conditions. 
  "So far the food processing industry has recorded the 
greatest success under these wartime conditions, since in this 
area it has sufficient raw materials coming in, and there is 
also a large market here. The largest processor here is the 
Banja Luka Dairy, which has an output of between 30,000 and 
35,000 liters of milk per day, in addition to well-known 
processed products like the famous Trappist cheese and other 
products. Then come Vitaminka, which also is utilizing capacity 
at slightly more than thirty percent, and Fruktona," Mudrenovic 
said. 
  Businessmen there do not want to talk in detail about all 
the 
places their exports are going to, ranging from Greece to 
England. Although a surplus of livestock has been recorded at 
the moment in Srpska republic, and prices are falling, the food 
manufacturing industry, represented by Levita in Gradiska, does 
not mind at all processing the famous purebred meat hog from 
Nova Topola, the "Topola Landrace," which is raised on the farm 
there. 
<H5>  Exports in Spite of the Sanctions </H5>
  The red-streaked bacon from Levita and other products meet 
world standards. Rich Lijevce, with its exemplary farmers, is 
feeding an entire region, about 60 percent of the Srpska 
republic, which is the size of Krajina territory. 
  As a matter of fact, in now the fourth year of war on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia, the main support for 
survival in these parts has been food production from Lijevce. 
Although capacity has been cut back, the economy gets by in 
various ways; the textile industry, for example, has been 
operating rather successfully. The firm 22. decembar has been 
maintaining 100 percent of its output, since it is making 
uniforms, but also other things in demand on the market. Blik of 
Banja Luka, Svila of Celinak and Medjugorje of Glamoc, which 
makes sweaters and T-shirts, are adjusting well. The leather 
industry is operating at one-third capacity, exporting even to 
Switzerland, and the wood manufacturers are supplying their 
customers in Europe. Thus the forest products firm Kljuc is 
unable to make Cherry dining room sets for the domestic market, 
since they are exported to England, with difficulty at the 
moment it is true, but the demand for this dining room furniture 
is still keen, although its price ranges between 3,000 and 5,000 
German marks. This is well-designed furniture made from the 
highest-quality wood, taken from Srpska republic forests. The 
forest products firm Sapa in Sanksi Most, Borja in Teslic and 
Radnik in Gradiska also have quality products, and there is an 
extremely high demand for products of the furniture factory in 
Gornji Podgradci, which is on the slopes of Kozara, not far from 
Gradiska. "Next year we celebrate the 140th anniversary of 
woodworking and furniture manufacturing in this region," says 
Lazo Sinik, director of the woodworking factory in Gornji 
Podgradci. "The first water-driven sawmill in these parts was 
set up back in 1855, and soon there was one driven by steam. We 
are woodworkers and furniture makers with a long tradition." 
<H5>  Payments to the Rescue </H5>
  In Gornji Podgradci they make solid wood furniture and 
dining 
room sets (tables and chairs in various shapes and designs), 
mainly from oak [Q. sessiliflora] from the slopes of Kozara and 
some English oak from the plains, as well as beech from the 
slopes of Kozara and Grmec, whose quality ranks very high in 
Europe. 
  "While the war was going on, we won the Gold Plane, which is 
the first prize at the International Furniture and Equipment 
Fair in Leskovac, in May of last year for the Petronija solid 
oak set of table and chairs," Sipik said, explaining why there 
is such a demand for the products from Gornji Podgradci. This 
factory also makes oak parquet flooring and saws lumber for the 
market. Within proximity of the Kozara forests and the Slavonian 
plains, it makes furniture of interest to customers abroad, 
where now it is difficult to export because of the sanctions. 
  Incel of Banja Luka, according to Milorad Serval, marketing 
director, is at present making toilet paper and other products 
and selling them from Benkovac to Vrsac and Leskovac, but only 
as much as is ordered, they are not operating at full capacity, 
since they lack imported sulfur and other ingredients, as well 
as domestic pulp wood. Serval says that hyperinflation and the 
suspension of payments have cut production to the minimum, but a 
shortage of the new dinars was felt on the very first day 
payments were resumed with the FRY. There are not many Avrams, 
and merchants here are raising prices of their products, as 
though their intention is to have marks "circulate" from hand to 
hand in gray payments, in order to purchase goods abroad for 
foreign exchange, while the dinar is being held back for use to 
meet minimum needs and obligations. The situation here is the 
reverse of that in Serbia, where prices dropped when the Avram 
appeared, while in Srpska republic they have risen. 
  "The main thing is that payments are possible. This is 
salvation for business people here," says Vukasin Basic, 
director of Veleprehrana in Banja Luka. "Now our economy also 
has a chance to do business normally." 
  One other piece of good news is coming in from the Srpska 
republic economy. On Saturday Elektrobosna in Jajce went into 
operation; it makes ferrosilicon, a strategic material used in 
the raw state in Smederevo and Niksic, that is, in the steel 
mills there, to make special steel alloys. Incidentally, before 
the war silicon processed from ferrosilicon was imported at $55 
per kilogram, while a kilogram of ferrosilicon was being 
exported for a dollar. 
  One gets the impression that wartime conditions have 
altogether 'purged' the Srpska republic economy of its inert 
bureaucracy, that the situation has now brought new people into 
the economy who are nimble and persistent, who do not have the 
feeling that "some things just cannot be done," people who know 
what they want and, most importantly, who can make on-the-spot 
decisions. 
  This kind of economy, one gets the impression, will be very 
important and successful on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia when the war is over and the sanctions are removed.

<F P=106> [Article by Filip Svarm: "In the House of the Three Milans"] </F>
  [Text] Mile Martic, the newly elected president of Krajina, 
has appealed to the Constitution and legal powers and removed 
Maj. Gen. Mile Novakovic, heretofore the commander of the 
general staff of the Serbian army of Krajina (SVK). Martic 
appointed to that post Milan Celetkovic, whom he previously 
promoted to the rank of general. Few people know the background 
of this decision. It is worth mentioning that a few days earlier 
diplomatic circles in Belgrade showed a sudden growth of 
interest in Gen. Novakovic. Specifically, who were all those who 
took note and passed on his statement, routine to say the least, 
that "an attack on the RS [Srpska republic] signifies at the 
same time an attack on the RSK [Serbian republic Krajina]," and 
what could it mean? 
<H5>  Two Unknowns </H5>
  Although he has been at the center of Krajina military and 
political life for quite some time now, Gen. Novakovic is not 
particularly well-known to the general public. As an officer in 
the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], he served in Zagreb, then he 
waged war in Banija. With the rank of colonel he commanded 
"Tactical Group 2" in Operation Corridor, and he distinguished 
himself with the breach at Debar-Kula. After the Maslenica 
action of the Croatian Army [HV] on 22 January 1993, Gen. 
Novakovic began to wage war in the second half of the 
Serbo-Croat conflict. However, things have not really been going 
well for him, especially not with the Croatian offensives in 
Medak pocket. Although the army that he commanded displayed 
maximum readiness for reprisal (shelling Karlovac, Zadar, Sisak, 
and even the suburbs of Zagreb -- Lucko), this was a political 
decision, not a military one. Especially since all of that had 
no direct consequences regarding the Croatian thrust into the 
villages under Velebit, nor regarding the fact that many small 
towns in Krajina were also shelled in return. Because of all 
that the Krajina Radicals like David Rastovic have called for 
Novakovic to be brought to account. The thesis that Krajina is 
actually governed by a military junta accountable to no one was 
in the same context. Gen. Novakovic evaded specific answers and 
political explanations as well as he could. But since this was 
the time of a fierce showdown between Martic and Goran Hadzic, 
his refusal to appear in the RSK Assembly in Plitvice, where 
debate of the defeat in the villages under Velebit was 
inevitable, was interpreted as siding with Hadzic. It is 
difficult to judge the extent to which the general staff 
commander at that time actually came into conflict with the head 
of the Krajina police at that time. It is evident that both 
signed the cathartic letter of support to Slobodan Milosevic 
when the concubinate of Socialists and Radicals collapsed. 
  If little is known about Gen. Novakovic, still less is known 
about his successor, Gen. Celetkovic. Born in the village of 
Mokrin, near Kikinda (in a family of colonists, it is assumed), 
he was also an active officer in the JNA. The information 
service of the SVK reports that he took part in all the 
significant battles in western Slavonia and in operations in the 
Sava Valley section of Bosnia (Derventa and Bosanski Brod). 
Before his appointment to commander of the SVK general staff, he 
held the post of commander of the 18th Corps of that same army. 
What little unofficial information could be obtained about Gen. 
Celetkovic indicates the following: He is an operative, an 
officer who gets around (he has held posts in the JNA and the 
army of the Srpska republic), and he has been in the SVK only 
since 1993. 
<H5>  The Bridge on the Sava </H5>
  Martic's decree to make the change in the top military 
leadership of his self-proclaimed state has echoed like thunder. 
Since there was no substantiation except the call for a 
discretionary assessment of the chief of state on the basis of 
the constitution, only speculations remain. 
  Gen. Novakovic and his team have gained a reputation as 
negotiators. That is, following the failure of the secret 
Krajina-Croat negotiations in Norway, there were a number of 
separate truces at the level of military delegations between 
various parts of Krajina and Croatia. On those occasions it was 
impossible to avoid granting certain guarantees to the other 
side and accepting certain obligations to the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces], which was the intermediary. The inspiration 
for this expedient came from Belgrade, since the time had come 
for a process of normalization of relations between the Croatian 
and Serbian regimes. The Krajina people, however, frightened 
even earlier that they would be "sold out," (this is illustrated 
by the success of the Krajina SDS, Milan Babic and the SRS 
[Serbian Radical Party] in the election there), showed that they 
had a mind of their own. Especially since even the subsequent 
visit of Zeljko Simic to Zagreb had no calming effect at all. As 
Milosevic's handpicked man, Martic was given the task of 
refuting the doubts and avoiding unfavorable agitation. He thus 
visited Dr. Karadzic in Pale, and showed as a guest much greater 
belligerence on behalf of Serbian unity than his host concerning 
the NATO ultimatum; it was even so great that the leader of the 
Bosnian Serbs had to relativize it. However, the ultimatum also 
weakened Belgrade's negotiating position with Zagreb to a fair 
extent. There was, then, a need to show Dr. Tudjman (and 
incidentally the UN as well) that the Serbian president is still 
making the rules of the game himself, at least in Croatia. The 
choice fell on the bridge over the Sava at Nova Gradiska. Two 
objectives were achieved by taking control of that border 
crossing (when the RSK ministry of internal affairs chased away 
members of the Nepal battalion of the UNPROFOR): entirely 
unlimited communications between the Srpska republic and Krajina 
in that region (intimidation of the UN with the threat of 
reprisals) and demonstration of `sovereignty' vis-a-vis Croatia 
(a demonstration that Martic must also be taken into account as 
Serb-Croat relations are normalized). 
  It seems that Gen. Novakovic was not inclined toward that 
operation. That is, he probably knew better than anyone how much 
stronger the Croatian Army has become in the meantime and how 
large a role the UNPROFOR has played in the fragile truces which 
he concluded, although it is possible that he was denied clear 
instructions. It is no wonder, then, that Serb-Croat hostilities 
in the northern Dalmatian theater escalated once again with the 
crisis over the bridge on the Sava, nor indeed that there should 
have been threats from the "insulted and surprised" peacekeeping 
forces that they would take back control of the bridge even if 
it takes force. It is assumed, moreover, that regardless of his 
belligerent statements concerning the NATO ultimatum, in the 
light of all that Novakovic was not prepared to aggravate 
relations on domestic terrain. When there is big trouble, he is 
not particularly charismatic at all. That is why he was removed, 
and his place has been taken by a man who carries out orders 
without question, but who knows quite well what is going on. One 
thing is certain: Novakovic, involved in negotiations up to his 
neck, did play his role. Just like Veljko Dzakula at one time, 
he was unable to avoid becoming entangled in the resolution of 
specific problems, forgetting that in these parts this is a 
matter for top-level policy and shrewd combinations. After all, 
it may be an accident, and then again maybe not, that 
"assumption" of control of the bridge at Nova Gradiska, just 
like Dzakula's first arrest in Japaga, near Pakrac, was 
entrusted to a man in whom Martic has confidence -- Krsto 
Zarkovic.

maritime borders of Croatia. This ship became the property of 
the Croatian Navy upon the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Navy from

participated in battles around Sibenik and in the Maslenica 
action when things were the hardest, Commander Miljenko Crljen 
said. "When the former Yugoslav People's Army was still on Vis

<F P=106> [Interview with Eng. Marin Vilovic by Toni Pastar; date and </F>
place not given--under the rubric of "Topical Interview"] 
  [Text] Aside from the Peruca Hydroelectric Power Plant 
being a military triumph of the Croatian Army [HV], which has 
driven out the Serb occupiers forever, it achieved another 
equally important victory -- Croatian experts have managed to 
save the dam from self-destruction, which was the objective of 
the Serbian criminals who set explosive charges on it, and they 
have made great progress in their efforts to repair it. Although 
Peruca is within range of the battlefront, that is, within range 
of enemy artillery, the activity has not ceased since 28 January 
1993, when the Serbs exploded the charges, and right now it has 
reached maximum intensity. We talked to Marin Vilovic, who heads 
the technical team of the HEP [Croatian Electric Power Industry] 
to repair the dam, about what has been done so far at Peruca and 
what still needs to be done to put the power plant in full 
service. 
  The same day when the Serbs exploded the charges on the dam, 
that is, on 28 January of last year, officials of the HEP, with 
the help of the HV and numerous others, began a fierce fight to 
prevent destruction of the dam, which was extensively damaged by 
the charges that were detonated. This was the first case in the 
world of an earth dam like Peruca being damaged that way. At 
that point the objective was to release as soon as possible the 
water from the lake, which was full, to take the load off the 
dam, and to establish the extent to which the clay core had been 
washed away or lost its impermeability. The explorations began 
the very day after the explosion. Surveyors came to the dam, and 
they were followed shortly by the geophysicists and divers. 
Those exploratory operations were at the same time the first 
steps towards repairing the dam. 
<H5>  Rebuilding the Gallery </H5>
  [Pastar] Have you completed the exploratory operations you 
began at that time? 
  [Vilovic] No. They are continuing, since everything we learn 
is useful in planning the project. 
  [Pastar] Following the Serbian demolition the Peruca dam was 
visited by numerous world experts on high dams who expressed 
their opinions and experiences. How useful was that? 
  [Vilovic] It was of course useful. Once we had the relevant 
indications of the extent of damage to the dam, we began working 
out alternative possibilities for repairing it. In June of last 
year we made a final decision among the twelve alternatives to 
replace the damaged flanks of the dam, where the explosions had 
caused the greatest damage, and to repair the damaged watertight 
core with a clay-concrete diaphragm. 
  [Pastar] This is a job that is still ahead of you. In early 
August of last year you began to repair the control gallery? 
  [Vilovic] Only when we had made the final commitment to the 
repair strategy did we begin to repair the control gallery, 
since the alternative chosen included that. Some of the 
alternatives did not envisage this. 
  [Pastar] When you began the work to repair the control 
gallery on 1 August, an announcement was made that the job in 
that section would be finished in four months? 
  [Vilovic] That deadline was envisaged only on the basis of 
certain assumptions. However, when we went into the gallery, we 
found that the damage was far greater. That is why the work has 
been going more slowly. The gallery on the right flank has been 
rebuilt almost entirely. Work is now being done on the straight 
section, in the lowest part of the gallery, and here the work is 
going somewhat faster. 
  [Pastar] A few days ago work began on the crown of the dam. 
What are all the things that will be done there? 
  [Vilovic] To be brief, from the standpoint of safety and 
operation, we will restore the dam to the condition it was in 
before the explosions. We have begun to remove the most damaged 
exterior parts of the dam. We will replace entirely the 
extensive area of the craters on the left and right flanks, and 
along the rest of the crown of the dam we will remove between 
five and 10 m from the crest. In those operations we will 
excavate and remove from the dam about 120,000 cubic meters of 
material, but considerably more than that will be returned to 
the dam. 
<H5>  The Waterproof Wall </H5>
  [Pastar] As far as we understand, when you remove all that 
material from the crown of the dam, then comes the most 
important undertaking, making the diaphragm? 
  [Vilovic] Absolutely right. 
  [Pastar] What in essence is a diaphragm, and what is its 
function? 
  [Vilovic] This will be a clay-concrete wall 1 m thick placed 
between the flanks of the dam from the control gallery, which is 
at the very foot, all the way to the crown. The diaphragm will 
be elastic and waterproof and will entirely take over the 
function of the damaged clay core. Actually, that diaphragm will 
be built into the damaged core itself. 
  [Pastar] Will you be able to take advantage of experiences 
from elsewhere in the world in doing this? 
  [Vilovic] Peruca is the first case in the world of 
deliberate 
demolition of a dam like this, but not the first case of repair 
projects. In the United States alone a clay-concrete diaphragm 
has been used to repair the Mud Mountain, New Wadel, and Wister 
dams, and there have also been cases like this on other 
continents and even here in Europe. In any case, the actual 
making of the diaphragm is not too complicated, but it is done 
with very expensive equipment. We have had talks about this with 
the three best-known world firms with experience in this work. 
They are Solitanche in France, Bauer in Germany, and Rodio in 
Italy. Croatia also has a firm for jobs like this with a world 
reputation, Geotehnika in Zagreb. 
  [Pastar] When the beginning of work on the crown of the dam 
was officially announced, you said that by the end of this year 
the dam would be repaired to the level of 353 m above sea level. 
When will al that be done? 
  [Vilovic] We expect by the end of May to remove all the 
material from the damaged flanks and crown, so that in early 
June we will be able to start on the diaphragm. The job of 
laying the diaphragm must be done continuously, without 
interruption. We estimate that that will take about four months. 
There is no foreseeable reason why we should not reach the 
target of 353 m above sea level by the end of the year. 
  [Pastar] At that level it will be possible to use 70 to 80 
percent of the previous capacity of Peruca's storage reservoir. 
When will the dam be entirely finished, when will the storage 
reservoir be in full use? 
  [Vilovic] Our ultimate goal is to guarantee the maximum 
capability of the storage reservoir. You see, even during the 
repair work to the control gallery, we are maintaining the 
storage reservoir at a level of about 330 m above sea level. And 
in the gallery work is now being done 25 m below the level of 
water in the lake. We expect repairs to the dam to be completed 
in the spring of 1995 and we expect the reservoir to fill with 
water in the summer of 1995. 
  [Pastar] Would it not have been simpler to remove the entire 
dam and build a new one on the site? 
  [Vilovic] In essence this will be a new dam. What you say 
would really have been simpler. However, in order to save 
financial funds, we opted for a much more complicated 
undertaking, but in the end we will get the same result, a 
completely safe and functional dam. 
<H5>  A Power Giant </H5>
  [Pastar] What will be the total investment in repairs? 
  [Vilovic] According to advance estimates, the entire repair 
will cost about 23,000,000 German marks. That sum includes the 
spillway on the left flank of the dam, which will be entirely 
rebuilt. 
  [Pastar] Will you have the money? 
  [Vilovic] It is not easy for Croatia to set aside that money 
under these conditions, but it must be done, since this is the 
only way of achieving lasting safety of the power supply to 
Dalmatia. The Cetina River is an electric power giant, and the 
Peruca Dam with its storage reservoir is the heart of it. That 
is why the money must be found. 
  [Pastar] Who are all those that have been involved in the 
repairs up to now? 
  [Vilovic] All the operations are being done according to the 
designs of Elektroprojekt of Zagreb, which has brought in other 
high dam experts in Croatia. The contractor repairing the 
control gallery is Konstruktor-Inzenjering from Split, which 
also got the contract for the work that has just begun on the 
crown. Geotehnika of Zagreb has also been hired, so far on the 
first phase of the exploratory work. 
  [Pastar] Mr. Vilovic, the dam is nevertheless within range 
of 
the battlefront, within range of Serbian artillery, which has 
targeted it more than once. Will the work continue unhindered in 
that regard? 
  [Vilovic] It is hard to say with certainty, but hope remains 
that there will be reason on the other side. They also know that 
this is exclusively a civilian economic project and that Croatia 
is determined to put the dam in full operation as soon as 
possible. High officials of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
have also seen that this is a civilian project, they were told 
that we were beginning the job, and they have certainly passed 
that on to the other side.

<F P=106> [Article by Drazen Jambrovic: "The Budget Must Not Be </F>
Expanded"] 
  [Excerpts] Zagreb -- The success of the stabilization 
program depends on the approval of the state budget, which was 
adopted after several months of preparations and sent to the 
Parliament last week. The budget totals about 5.2 billion German 
marks [DM], DM1.5 billion more than in 1993. According to Prime 
Minister Nikica Valentic, this is a "firm budget that must not 
be expanded, not even by a dinar." To exceed the set parameters 
could endanger the stabilization efforts. 
  Firm budget limitations have been set to reign in very high 
public expenditures. Of the total DM5.2 billion, DM1.8 billion 
is devoted to pension payments, DM1.3 billion to health 
insurance, DM1 billion to local government expenditures. The 
total public expenditures amount to more than DM9 billion, or 50 
percent of the GNP, estimated to be DM18 billion, including the 
"grey economy" and money transfers from abroad. According to 
Valentic, there is reason for alarm when total public 
expenditures surpass 50 percent of the country's GNP, even for a 
country at war. This is why expenditures and the budget must not 
be increased despite a series of justifiable requests. Saying 
that without increased production there is no chance of covering 
public spending, Valentic added that the government had taken 
certain steps in this direction in the areas of construction, 
shipbuilding, agriculture, tourism, and industry. [passage

<H5>  Excise Taxes by 1 July </H5>
  Excise taxes, special taxes on oil derivatives, alcohol, 
beer, nonalcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and imported 
cars will be introduced by 1 July. The tax reform continues with 
the introduction of the excise tax on six new products (coffee 
had already been taxed earlier). The next step is the 
introduction of the value-added tax. [passage omitted]

  [Unattributed article: "Czech Citizens of Slovakia"] 
  [Text] By the end of 1993, approximately 43,000 Czechs had 
applied for Slovak citizenship. This year, additional 
applications, which are routinely processed by the Slovak 
Ministry of Interior, are being received. Those that come from 
the Czech Republic get preferential treatment. According to the 
ministry, two or three applications on the average arrive daily, 
and their processing takes approximately one month. Slovak 
authorities demand that applicants furnish their birth and 
marriage certificates, an extract from the crime register, and a 
certificate verifying their permanent residence in the Slovak 
Republic. Bratislava has so far not made available any 
statistics on the number of Slovaks who have, up to now, 
requested that their Slovak citizenship be supplanted by Czech 
citizenship.

<F P=106> [Article by Zdenek Jicinsky: "The Risks Arising From the </F>
Ideologization of Vaclav Klaus's Points of View"] 
  [Text] How many Klauses do we actually have? And which is 
the real one? The pragmatic one, for whom--from the point of 
view of economic transformation--we have already crossed the 
Rubicon, from which it should logically ensue that the issue of 
a struggle over the nature of our social and economic system 
has, in essence, been resolved? 
  Or, the one who, a little later, at a seminar on the 
government's economic strategy in Prague on 4 February 1994 
raised an admonitory finger: "The unfinished ideological 
dispute over the future of our social order will continue--one, 
under the slogan of consumer protection; two, under the slogan 
of environmental protection; three, under the slogan of 
protection for professional groups or chambers; and under other 
slogans. This dispute is taking place in the mass media and is 
there for all who want to see it explicitly, although it is 
camouflaged behind catchy phrases. The issue involves whether 
we are to have a truly free society and a free market or whether 
we are to have an interventionist, cooperative, neosocialist 
system that will lead us--albeit by more subtle means--into the 
same pitfalls as the former communist regime." 
  Klaus has accentuated this caustic tone and vocabulary very 
much in a number of his recent speeches. As a man who, in a 
relatively short period of time, has undergone extraordinary 
development and been transformed from a recognized economist and 
finance minister into the Czech prime minister and the most 
influential Czech politician, he has also learned to adapt his 
behavior and frequently proceed very pragmatically in practical 
policy. If recently, in the spirit of his ideology, he was 
again acting as a mentor to the Czech, and, in Davos, to the 
international public, then this was certainly intentional. 
  In view of the overall political situation, it seems--from 
his point of view--expedient to establish a clear and 
unequivocal strategy in the period prior to the approaching 
local and senatorial elections and, thus, to put the Civic 
Democratic Party [ODS] on the right track as the strongest 
political party and the main force in the government coalition. 
At the same time, a signal will also be given to the partners 
in the government coalition so that they do not forget who plays 
the leading role in it--both as a party and personally--and who, 
first and foremost, determines government policy. 
  Attacking the critics "from the right"--from CESKY DENIK and 
various organizations such as the Club of Non-Aligned 
Activists--who reproach the ODS and Klaus for deviating from the 
preelection promises, for not implementing a genuine right-wing 
policy, for not fighting hard enough against the communist past, 
and so on is also a specific form of defense. This could also 
be a signal to the bulk of the ODS--where, in various contexts, 
it is apparent that his views and stances meet with 
disagreement--that he is still the leading personality in this 
party. 
  At the same time, the acerbity of his views is directed 
against the opposition indiscriminately. He is attempting to 
politically disqualify and discredit it by identifying it with 
the old communist regime or by attributing to it the intention 
to revive socialism in a new form. The attitude prevalent among 
the public at the moment is not as uncritical as it used to be, 
although his "moral wear-and- tear" is still relatively slight. 
His ill-considered and one-sided points of view on various 
foreign policy issues in particular are criticized quite openly 
in the press. There are various reservations within the 
governing coalition with regard to Klaus's statements. 
Therefore, it will be necessary to monitor how the public 
perceives his ideological confirmation of his strategy and what 
kind of practical consequences this will have in Czech politics. 
<H5>  Adversaries From the Third Way </H5>
  Klaus, in all sorts of situations, categorically turns 
against the so-called third way and those whom he considers to 
be its advocates. He declares them to be the main adversaries 
in the endeavor to create a market economy. A very broad 
spectrum of people support this third way; almost everyone who 
disagrees with Klaus's concept that the free market is the basis 
and main instrument for dealing with all economic, ecological, 
and social issues belongs to it. So, he can indirectly proclaim 
himself to be the most conceptual and most consistent 
representative--and, undoubtedly, he feels this way--of the 
transition from the communist system to the market economy and a 
free society. This was also the spirit in which he addressed 
the international economic forum in Davos. 
  There he criticized Western Europe, among other things, for 
its etatist thinking and for its prevailing ideas about a social 
welfare state, while just a few people realize that the state 
can only fulfill this function if its citizens sacrifice a 
considerable amount of their freedom. 
  I have cited these views expressed by Klaus to illustrate 
the 
ideological nature of his way of thinking. Klaus adjusts the 
facts in accordance with his ideas so that he can more 
convincingly formulate his views. Klaus's ideology, however, is 
false knowledge. His ideas about a free market and a free 
society are implemented in virtually no European country. It is 
necessary to say the following: While Margaret Thatcher 
governed in Britain according to similar ideals, there was no 
economic growth there and even her resistance to the integrative 
processes within the European Community had unfavorable 
consequences for her country. This, however, ultimately caused 
her political downfall. The Czech Republic cannot be compared 
with the UK, either in terms of its economic and political power 
or in terms of its population and geographic position. The 
latitude for an isolationist position by the Czech Republic is 
much smaller. 
  A logical question arises in connection with these 
ideological, almost demagogically concluded formulations about 
the only correct method of transformation and the changes 
associated with it: Is any idea about economic transformation, 
apart from the one espoused by Vaclav Klaus, an example of this 
adverse third way? 
  R. Dahrendorf, whom perhaps even Klaus cannot regard as a 
crypto- communist and advocate of the "third way," wrote the 
following in his analysis of the potential for the development 
of the postcommunist countries in an open society: "Within the 
framework of the constitution of freedom, hundreds of paths lead 
forward, and they will all mix elements of economic policy and 
social reform in a way the purists will not like." He pointed 
out in this context that fundamentalism is more attractive than 
had been anticipated. "Fundamentalism may take on various forms, 
including nationalism, but, in each case, it deviates from the 
path toward an open society" (Reflections on the 
Revolution in Europe, page 144). 
  I am concerned that Klaus's economic 
fundamentalism--moreover, associated with a certain political 
nationalism--is diverting us from a path toward an open society; 
this view is borne out by recent Czech experience. 
<H5>  Oversimplified Condemnations of the "Welfare State" </H5>
  Questions about how Czech society will develop in the 
future, 
and the kind of relations it will forge with its neighbors and 
the whole of Europe, and the answers the relevant political 
forces give, will be very important for the Czech Republic's 
future development and its standing in Europe. The way the 
Czech Republic views the complicated and contentious 
ramifications of the integrative processes in Western Europe, 
especially the European Union as its basis, will be particularly 
important in these relations. 
  Klaus's ideas about a free society and a free market along 
with his condemnation of the bureaucratized, etatized society in 
Western European countries with their "welfare states" are 
oversimplified. In this ideological form, they could hardly 
become the positive vision for the future development of Czech 
society, which Klaus often talks about. In this regard, his 
ideas are too one-sided and lack substance. 
  In Western Europe in recent years some people have been 
critical of the intolerable social burden associated with the 
welfare state, a burden that has become a barrier to economic 
stimulation and motivation. It is a burden that continues to be 
intolerable, and not only in view of the economic recession. 
Those who want to alter economic and social policy--and it 
makes no difference whether they are social democrats or 
conservatives--are, however, very well aware that they cannot 
return to the stage preceding the evolution of the welfare state 
with its complicated system of sociopolitical relations and the 
institutions associated with them, a system that guarantees a 
way of life for society and, at the same time, does not endanger 
the principles of its arrangement. 
  This system of relations associated with a welfare state 
can, 
in any case, be altered and amended, but while maintaining its 
basic values and structures. It is strange that the concept of 
social justice, so reviled by Vaclav Klaus, is an element of the 
programs of all significant parties, parties of a social 
democratic and a conservative nature. 
  Fundamental legal acts, the constitutions of Western 
European 
countries, the International Agreement on Social, Economic, and 
Cultural Rights, and the European Social Charter have been an 
intrinsic element and manifestation of this development since 
World War II. No influential political forces are trying to 
abolish it and they do not treat it with disdain--as is 
customary in our country--as an undesirable "infestation" of the 
constitution by something that does not belong to it. 
  The government draft law on state employees, which strips 
them of their right to organize themselves in trade unions, is 
also an expression of this cold-shouldered attitude toward the 
Charter on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. It is strange that 
right-wing oriented journalists consider the stipulations of the 
International Agreement on Social, Economic, and Cultural Rights 
and the conventions of the International Labor Office--which 
guarantee working people the right to organize themselves in 
trade unions and other rights--to be a negative consequence of 
socialist tendencies that, in their opinion, were broadly 
applied in Western Europe after World War II. 
  Views that the Czech Republic can develop quite separately 
and that it will not have to respect these main trends and rules 
of modern social and legal development (which is obviously what 
Klaus had in mind at the ODS assembly in Koprivnice when he 
described the Czech Republic as a "country trying not to repeat 
the errors the advanced Western countries have made in their 
policy in recent years") are groundless. If they were, however, 
to become fact after all, this would not mean that the Czech 
Republic would avoid the mistakes made by the advanced Western 
European countries, but it would be a sad testimony to its 
economic and social decline and to its inability to economically 
advance itself. From these points of view, Klaus's ideological 
opinions could have directly and indirectly unfavorable domestic 
and international political consequences. The complaint made by 
the Czech trade unions to the International Labor Office against 
the Czech Government concerning the aforementioned issue is 
oddly reminiscent of the complaint that Charter 77 sent to this 
organization under the former regime about the violation of 
various rights of the working people. I do not think this is to 
the Czech Republic's credit or that it will improve its 
international prestige. 

<H5>    Integration Is Not Only Economic </H5>
  The same also applies to Vaclav Klaus's negative attitude 
toward integrative processes within the European Union 
associated with the Maastricht Treaty and the problems that 
currently exist inside the European Union. In this context, 
Klaus has been critical of the too high and unnecessary 
ambitions for a unitarian or almost unitarian concept of Europe. 
(As is his wont, he modified this issue, because integration 
within the European Union cannot be identified with unification 
and federalization is not unification). According to him, 
Europe's future does not depend on the existence and activities 
of multilateral European institutions, but on the quality and 
structure of the political, social, and economic system in the 
individual European countries. 
  It goes without saying that, following the collapse of the 
communist system and the Soviet empire, a new situation has 
arisen in Europe and new and previously unanticipated problems 
are cropping up from the point of view of the integrative 
processes in Western Europe. However, Klaus, in the grip of his 
economic reductionism and unilateral criticism, is overlooking 
certain political facts here that could have very serious 
repercussions for the Czech Republic. 
  Criticism of the shortcomings of the integrative processes 
within the European Union--in which, incidentally, Klaus is in 
no way original, because it is commonplace in Western European 
political circles--must not lead to neglect of the essential 
political chain of events. If the integrative process does not 
continue and the will for a common foreign and security policy 
does not increase, destabilization could spread throughout the 
former post-communist countries from Russia all the way to 
Western Europe, where the policy of power-wielding interests 
could again begin to be asserted and Germany could again become 
an uncontrollable power. Former FRG Chancellor H. Schmidt said 
in an interview with P. Glotz that it is in the interests of all 
of Germany's neighbors to integrate this huge state and that the 
political elite in all the states of Europe have a pressing 
interest in "trussing up Germany." This is, according to him, 
one of the important reasons for ensuring that, despite the 
current Maastricht crisis, European integration continues 
(DIE NEUE GESELLSCHAFT No. 1/1994, page 7). 
  No Czech politician, let alone the Czech prime minister, can 
ignore facts of this kind, because they are vitally important 
for the future fate of the Czech state and the Czech nation. 
The problem of European integration is a complex one and it 
cannot be limited to an economic dimension. 
  Following the breakup of the CSFR, the Czech Republic is a 
relatively small state in a geopolitically important region, in 
Central Europe. Therefore, it must give careful thought to 
providing for its fundamental national and state interests while 
being aware of its possibilities and its role. It must, first 
and foremost, strive for good relations and cooperation with its 
neighbors. Putting on airs and isolationism--as a specific 
manifestation of Czech nationalism--are only to its detriment 
here, especially since, following the collapse of the communist 
regimes, the prerequisites have been created for relations 
between the Czech Republic and its neighbors to gradually free 
themselves from the negative heritage of the past and become 
relations of genuine cooperation. The ideologization of foreign 
policy, which manifests itself in some of Klaus's statements, is 
an obstacle to a well-balanced and promising Czech foreign 
policy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Irena </F>
Satavova and Eva Klvacova; place and date not given: "Ten `Whys' 
for Vaclav Klaus"] 
  [Text] The first interview by EKONOM in the new year 
was the already traditional discussion with Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus about issues concerning the economic transformation 
and its progress. This time our questions were directed at the 
deeper pivotal connections of the reform, at the logic for 
selecting the individual systemic measures. 
  [EKONOM] Why is the Czech Republic being acknowledged as the 
most successful of the former socialist countries after three 
years of the economic transformation? Do you see the main reason 
more in the relatively favorable starting position of our 
economy, or do you think the chosen transformation strategy was 
decisive? 
  [Klaus] That question has two parts: first, distinguishing 
between what was a kind of gift from the past and what was our 
own doing, and second, determining the factors that played the 
key role in the transformation process. 
  I tend to play down the view that we are doing well simply 
because during the First Republic there was a democratic 
tradition here and a good level of industrial production. 
Naturally, it is a question of degree and quantitative 
calculation, but my assessment of the ratio between the past and 
the present is 2:8. I think the absolutely key factor was that 
we succeeded in choosing precisely at this time the only correct 
and the only possible way. Given the same kind of past, if the 
concept of one of the "third" ways had prevailed, then today we 
would be exactly where the other postcommunist countries are now. 
  The general answer I can give to the other part of the 
question is that the uniqueness of our transformation process is 
the interplay of our political and economic factors. The notion 
that to achieve success only the political factors and the 
velvetness of the revolution would suffice, or that being a 
little bit better economists than the others would be enough, is 
not right. I believe that the magic and the charm lies precisely 
in the mutual interplay that makes possible an upward-leading 
process. If this interplay is poor it creates a vicious circle 
of hopelessness, which is precisely where many postcommunist 
countries find themselves. 
  [EKONOM] Why, in spite of a number of problems of which 
every 
citizen is to some extent aware, there still exists a large 
measure of consensus on the reform among the majority of the 
population? Do you think it is due to the fact that the reform 
was measured out in the right doses or to the fact that people 
were able to recognize that the chosen way is correct...? 
  [Klaus] I think that the consensus is the result of a very 
open, clear, and forceful reform policy, and of the fact that we 
simply managed to sell our basic concept which we promulgated 
and are promulgating. Using the terminology of your journal, we 
could say that we were good salesmen of our concept of the 
reform and that we marketed it very well. We are talking about a 
kind of perpetual election campaign, incessant explanations, 
arguments, and influencing of the public. That has not happened 
and is not happening now in the other postcommunist countries. 
  [EKONOM] Why is there in the Czech Republic, in spite of the 
decline in production, a significantly lower unemployment rate 
than to the west and the east of us? Is it because of the growth 
of the private, especially the service, sector, or because, in 
the thus-far unprivatized enterprises, overemployment still 
persists? 
  [Klaus] From Milton Friedman I learned to always distinguish 
permanent quantities which have their fixed, long-term value, 
from transitory quantities which deviate in the short term from 
some level that holds over the long run. Our temporary 
unemployment rate is now evidently below this long-term value, 
at which it will stabilize itself in time. In that respect, the 
short-term movement in the unemployment rate will certainly be 
upward, but it will be a continuous and moderate movement within 
the range of a few percent, not a big jump. 
  As far as the causes of the favorable short-term 
unemployment 
rate are concerned, in my view there are three. One stands apart 
from the economic mechanism and belongs more in the category of 
the societal and social climate in the country. I evaluate it 
with the help of the participation rate (share of the employed 
or those looking for employment among the able-to-work 
population) which, thanks to historical, ideological, as well as 
peculiarly specific traditions, has been extremely high here. 
Its decline to the level usual in other countries is the natural 
consequence of the democratization process. The remaining two 
factors, of which one is positive and the other negative, are 
economic. The positive one is the tremendous dynamics of the 
nascent private sector which succeeded in absorbing a 
considerable part of the released labor force. From the 
structural point of view, there has been an evident outflow of 
the work force from the primary and secondary sectors to the 
service sector, which is very labor intensive. That, after all, 
also made possible the tourist boom here, while at the same time 
being financed by the tourist boom. The third, this time 
negative, element is the survival of the phenomenon called in 
the economic literature "labor hoarding." It is known from the 
standard course of an economic cycle in the West, when during a 
recession and a fall in demand production declines much more 
than employment, because companies hope that it will be better 
for them to keep their skilled workforce and not have to look 
when demand goes up again for new people whom they would have to 
train. Labor hoarding here has many causes. Today, from my 
position as prime minister I would not presume to determine 
whether this is a standard, in its own way a rational, 
phenomenon or a specific behavior by the present and former 
state enterprises, and I have a feeling that not even your 
magazine's independent experts have enough arguments to do that. 
  [EKONOM] Why, even after the law on bankruptcy and 
settlement 
went into full effect, are there no bankruptcies? Do you suppose 
it is because of the nonexistence of real, private creditors, 
the interlinkage of the banking sphere and the enterprises, or 
the overload in the courts? 
  [Klaus] Bankruptcy is not some desired economic phenomenon. 
The economic phenomenon we want is restructuring. It has many 
forms: enterprises divide, combine, some grow, some fail 
spectacularly, and the notion that the only correct form of 
restructuring is a bankruptcy is simply fundamentally wrong. I 
believe that a critic of the restructuring process of the Czech 
economy should assess the rate of this process while keeping in 
mind that the absolute number of bankruptcies is only a very 
imprecise indicator of it. Those who connect these two phenomena 
are making a terrible analytical mistake. 
  Which indicator of the restructuring do I consider better 
than the number of bankruptcies? I would offer any number of 
them. For example, the number of available jobs on the labor 
market, which, however, are poorly recorded in the statistics, 
or the rate of labor turnover. The correlation between them and 
the number of restructured enterprises says more than a mere 
number of bankruptcies, which is only the tip of the iceberg. 
  [EKONOM] Why was it possible to maintain during the entire 
period since December 1990 a stable exchange rate of the Czech 
koruna and not find ourselves in the vicious circle: imported 
inflation--general inflation--imbalance in the balance of 
payments--further devaluation? What arguments can be used to 
counter the demand for the revaluation of the exchange rate, in 
favor of which speaks the undervaluation of the exchange rate in 
relation to the parity of the buying power, and how to resist 
the pressure from the lobby of exporters calling for further 
devaluation? 
  [Klaus] Fundamental for the success of the reform was to 
create what I would call a cushion--that is a sufficient 
difference between the real exchange rate and what is usually 
hypothetically called parity of the buying power. In other 
words, the economic exchange rate had to be placed on its 
marginal, not the average, level. Its stability during the 36 
months proved that our choice of the starting rate of exchange 
was absolutely correct. Since that time it has been continually 
strengthening, in other words, the real exchange rate is 
increasing even though the nominal rate remains constant. We 
succeeded, therefore, in fulfilling the announced prerequisite 
of having the nominal exchange rate become the anchor of the 
entire economic system, the single fixed point around which 
other quantities revolve, not the other way around. 
  As far as the devaluation or revaluation pressures are 
concerned, they reflect the fact that various economic entities 
stand on various sides of the market and each pushes its own 
interests. The magic of the market lies in the fact that a 
partisan interest must not and cannot prevail, as long as there 
is not in power an obtuse and bumbling government which would 
allow itself be influenced by those lobbyists. I believe that 
with our government no such danger exists. But it would be an 
absolute mistake to assume that our exchange rate is rigid. 
Although the nominal exchange rate is firm the real exchange 
rate is growing stronger, so that actual revaluation goes on 
continually. But I do not think that there should be a nominal 
revaluation. 
  [EKONOM] Why was it necessary to resort to wage controls? 
Don't you have the feeling that the thus far unprivatized 
enterprises, to which it should mainly apply, do not take wage 
regulation very seriously, while private entrepreneurs use it as 
a shield against the demands of their employees? 
  [Klaus] In the ideal market, after the entire transformation 
in its macro and micro dimensions is completed, wage regulation, 
of course, makes no sense and has no justification. We are not 
yet in a situation where stable market relations exist; when the 
government analyzed the developments in the wage situation, the 
movement of the wages caused it justified concern. Although 
after the price liberalization a so-called second transformation 
cushion was created, when the average real wage fell below the 
average labor productivity, since the initial months of 1991 a 
process of real wage increases began. A faster increase of wages 
over prices is in this situation of emptying the cushion logical 
and quite all right, the only disturbing thing is its rate--and 
that was, in our opinion, considerably exceeded in 1993 and did 
nothing else but increase inflation and worsen our economic 
position abroad. Therefore the government resorted, even though 
it was not very happy about it, to this unpopular step, and the 
minute it is under the impression that it can retreat from it, 
it will do so without delay. A country which quickly increases 
its real wages pushes itself out of the market. We know many 
cases where this happened--we can name, for example, the former 
GDR after the unification of Germany or the latest developments 
in Slovenia--which should serve as a warning. 
  And as far as the fact that some "escape" from the wage 
regulation, well, every regulation has its drawbacks. Economic 
policy has, always and everywhere, its two dimensions: one sends 
a psychological signal and the other has the effect of blocking 
or making something impossible. These exist parallel to each 
other even in the case of wage regulation. Which one of them has 
a stronger effect I cannot say exactly, but I believe that there 
is a certain effect. 
  [EKONOM] Why is it necessary to maintain a balanced budget 
and not allow a deficit budget, when all West European countries 
work with one. In this connection the case often cited is that 
of the United States, which has one of the greatest indebtedness 
in the world and which at the same time was one of the first to 
get out of the current recession? 
  [Klaus] All parents know the standard question of their 
children: Why do I have to be home by nine when all other 
children are allowed to stay out until eleven? Remember the 
answer you give them, and my answer to your question is not that 
different. Just because somebody else does something differently 
does not necessarily mean that it is good and that we have to do 
the same no matter what. It is absolutely clear that to run a 
deficit in the state budget, when we borrow at the cost of 
somebody else in the future, is bad policy. Let nobody confuse 
it with an individual's decision to take out a loan, which is 
made by one and the same person who knows that he himself will 
have to repay that loan. The decision of the state as a whole is 
something entirely different than such a decision which carries 
individual responsibility, and the state today and 20 years 
later, when the loan may have to be repaid, is not an identical 
entity. And that a deficit leads to inflation, which is another 
form of taxation on a number of economic entities, is also 
absolutely clear. 
  [EKONOM] Why was it possible to make the assumption that 
this 
year the inflation will be only in the single digits? Is such 
expectation realistic? 
  [Klaus] To inflation applies the theory that less inflation 
is better then more inflation, and no inflation is the best. 
Why? The entire economic system is held together by a general 
equivalent--money. In fulfilling its function as a measure of 
value it should be stable. If we have inflation, the measure is 
no longer made of steel but of rubber, which sometimes 
stretches, sometimes contracts. But we need to work with 
economic quantities about which we know what value they have 
today and what value they will have tomorrow, the day after 
tomorrow, in a week, in a year. That stability of values, made 
possible by minimizing inflation, is an enormous economic good. 
Not mentioning the fact that many of us have fixed incomes which 
are devalued by inflation. These are standard textbook arguments 
and are no exaggeration, as they may appear to some. 
  When I declare that inflation will be in the single digits 
this year I am not arguing about percentages, I am stating above 
all the following: inflation will be visibly lower than in 1993 
when it approached 20 percent. 
  [EKONOM] Why are many prices still regulated by the 
government? To what extent is it a question of the social 
tolerability of the reform and to what extent a question of 
subsidizing monopolies? 
  [Klaus] Undoubtedly, some prices are still regulated by the 
government, but there are not many of them. In comparison with 
many West European countries we are a country that is regulated 
less rather than more. I am not aware that the basic objective 
of regulation is to struggle with the monopolies. It is rather a 
question of a general tolerability of the reform. Prices must be 
adjusted during the entire transformation process toward their 
final point, which we can define as the world prices, only 
slowly (that is, after all, another rule of transformation). We 
are all angry at Skoda-Volkswagen when it wants to sell vehicles 
for world prices calculated by the exchange rate. That is simply 
nonsense, which, unfortunately, many of those gentlemen do not 
understand. I would not confine the reasons for changing prices 
gradually only to the social aspect, because far more important 
is the economic aspect: increasing the price of a railroad 
ticket to the level of world prices would not mean just that 
some will stop riding the trains because it is socially 
intolerable for them, but the next day the railroad would perish 
because it would cease to be used by those for whom it is 
economically intolerable. And it is precisely in cases of some 
of the more or less badly structured branches that is is useful 
to have the state help keep the adjustment process gradual by 
regulating prices. 
  [EKONOM] Why, in spite of the fact that the private sector 
is 
growing very rapidly and shared in the creation of GDP in the 
third quarter of 1993 by more than 60 percent, is the decline in 
industrial production continuing? Data for the first three 
quarters of 1993 showed a decline of 5.2 percent, and in 
construction 4.1 percent, in comparison with the same period 
last year. What is the reason? 
  [Klaus] Statistical data that describe this phenomenon may 
be 
correct, maybe not. If they are correct, then all I can say is 
that the process of eliminating the economically unhealthy 
production for which there is no demand has simply not yet ended 
in our economy. Nothing more, nothing less. It is a different 
matter, however, if the numbers do not give us the correct 
information. And I can make serious arguments for thinking that 
this is the case. 
  First, we have here an enormous problem with the master 
database. Every statistician knows that the most important thing 
is to have a permanent master database with which to work. 
Thanks to the restructuring and privatization there have been 
some unreal changes in our database of enterprises, and I do not 
believe that with all these transformations every enterprise is 
submitting statistical reports compatible with those they had 
submitted in the previous year. If we grant that the error could 
be on the order of 1-2 percent, which, for every statistician, 
is a perfect result, just such an error means that the GDP in 
the third quarter of 1993 registered not a decline of 5 percent 
but an increase of 1 percent, for example. 
  The second factor is the more precise evidential capability 
of the natural quantities than of the value quantities. 
Therefore, no matter how paradoxical it sounds, I also pay 
careful attention to quantities in the current prices, and I put 
big question marks over the quantities in the constant prices. 
The complexity of constructing price indexes is so enormous that 
an error in the category of 1-2 percent is completely negligible 
and rather tends to be much greater. The third argument in favor 
of my assertion is that in all cases individual statistical 
indicators measure only the gross rate, not the net quantities. 
The question of what is getting rid of the "wheel spinning" in 
any number of economic activities and what really is a decline 
in the net product, that for me is an unknown and statistically 
not recordable phenomenon. It leads me to the conclusion that 
the information, for example, about the decline in GDP during 
the first three quarters of 1993 by 0.9 percent says absolutely 
nothing to me, it only evokes the problem of political 
vindication and explanation of that number.

<F P=106> [Article by Vera Kamenickova of the Czech Republic Ministry </F>
of Finance: "Budget 1994"] 
  [Text] In connection with the drafting and approval of the 
1994 budget, two basic comments have been heard concerning the 
impact of the budget on economic growth. On one hand, the 
presenters of the budget are portrayed as budget 
fundamentalists, people who try to maintain a balanced budget no 
matter what the cost, even at the cost of undermining the 
possibility for economic growth. Parallel with that we also hear 
the view that the budget is balanced only because it uses 
off-budget money, namely, from the National Property Fund, to 
cover some of its expenditures. 
  The truth can be found on both sides, although I would not 
use the term fundamentalism in the first instance. 
  Economic theory unequivocally commends a balanced, even a 
surplus, budget. In spite of that, most countries report a 
budget deficit. And the reason? In many cases it is a matter of 
the growth of social expenditures in the broadest sense of the 
word, which goes hand in hand with the effort to reduce the tax 
burden and thus indirectly support economic growth. 
  Obviously, no country has at its disposal a set of 
instructions on how to best distribute the tax burden in order 
to support growth, justice, tax neutrality, and solve the social 
aspects. That is, after all, attested to by the more or less 
frequent interventions by individual countries into their fiscal 
systems and the unceasing struggle to reduce the budget deficit. 
  The fiscal policy of the Czech Republic is based on 
Czechoslovakia's fiscal policy tradition. It was characterized 
from the very beginning by considerable circumspection, as far 
as a budget deficit is concerned. That circumspection was 
assumed also by the postwar government, and so the creators of 
the economic reform did not have to deal at its start with the 
expense of a direct, inherited budget deficit. 
  In the Czech Republic, the effort to maintain a balanced 
budget is understandable also in view of the still immature 
capital market. And other than in there, the resources for 
financing a possible budget deficit, if we do not consider 
foreign countries, are not available. 
  There is even no need to argue with the fact that a strict 
budgetary policy has proven itself effective in the course of 
the economic reform. And it would be very difficult to find a 
model which would prove that a deficit budgetary policy can be 
successful. 
  So much about budget fundamentalism. The situation becomes 
more complicated when it comes to dealing with the assertion 
that the budget has a hidden deficit, because it finances some 
of its expenditures from the resources of the National Property 
Fund. It is known, for example, that Great Britain achieved a 
surplus budget precisely during the years when part of the 
revenues came from the proceeds from privatization. It is 
therefore quite clear that when it comes to the proceeds from 
privatization being used by the budget, the Czech Republic is 
not the only one. 
<H5>  Proceeds From Privatization and the Budget </H5>
  The assertion that using the resources of the National 
Property Fund is using capital for current 
expenditures--consuming capital assets--is to some degree 
arbitrary, as long as the budget finances its capital 
expenditures from its current revenues. Then it is only a matter 
of technicalities. The specification of the budget expenditures 
which will be financed this way serves primarily to determine 
the extent of the resources which will not be taken from current 
budget revenues but from the proceeds from privatization. 
  The Czech Republic is still an economy in transformation, in 
which even nonstandard operations are financed from the budget. 
An example is the public debt. This debt (both external and 
internal) was not created primarily by the accumulation of 
budget deficits from the past.

  Part of the public debt in the amount of 163 billion Czech 
korunas [Kc] is, among other things, the debt that was created 
by taking over a proportional share of government loans from the 
former Czechoslovak State Bank (Kc26 billion), by the settlement 
of exchange rate differences from the devaluations in 1990 (Kc17 
billion), by assuming some obligations of the Czechoslovak 
Commercial Bank--clearing the balance in this bank of the 
obligations and claims which accrued to this bank before the 
year 1990 (Kc58 billion), costs arising from the issue of bonds 
for comprehensive housing construction--the funds were 
transferred to communities in the form of grants (Kc9 billion). 
  It is proposed that in 1994 the National Property Fund 
should 
provide financing in the amount of Kc18.3 billion out of its 
total proceeds from privatization, which is 46 percent of its 
expected revenues for this year. 
<H5>  What the Municipalities Want </H5>
  But one can point out some other blemishes that mar the 
beauty of the 1994 budget. In many countries local budgets are 
not, as is the case in the Czech Republic, basically part of the 
the central budget document. The sole exception are grants from 
the central budget to local budgets. 
  Moreover, in the Czech Republic this practice is the object 
of constant arguments between the representatives of the 
municipalities and the Ministry of Finance. The municipalities 
are demanding that only some of their revenues be budgeted 
within the framework of the law on state budget. As a result, 
the actual revenues of municipalities are much higher than those 
which are specified in the law on state budget. This then makes 
the analyzing of the management of municipalities and district 
offices extremely difficult. That applies not only to 1993, in 
which revenues from personal income taxes were higher than 
expected, but also to previous years. 
  In the Czech Republic there still exists a certain kind of 
paternalism of the state over the budget of the municipalities. 
But it must be added that in many respects some representatives 
of the municipalities do not resent such paternalism. The proof 
is the frequent visits to the Ministry of Finance and other 
central offices, motivated by the effort to gain something extra 
for the municipal budget. On the other hand, many municipalities 
consider unnecessary something that is quite common in many 
countries--a regular, and accessible to all who are interested, 
audit of their budget management. It would substantially 
increase their credibility both in the eyes of the citizens and 
of the banking sector. 
<H5>  Reserves and Their Utilization </H5>
  The subhead General Accounts Management would need a much 
more substantial reduction than the one it went through so far. 
The holding of a large reserve in the budget--that is, money 
whose allocation is decided only in the course of the year, is 
conducive to wastefulness. Not even considering the fact that 
because the existence of the reserve is generally known, the 
demands on it far exceed its capacity. 
  By the way it constructs the budget and allocates expected 
budget revenues to individual departments, the government 
expresses a certain set of priorities for the given year. 
Additional expenditures from General Accounts can interfere with 
these priorities, because the decision concerning these 
expenditures does not always have to be made with the knowledge 
of all the correlations that are weighed in making decisions on 
the overall allocation of budget revenues. 
  A certain technical reserve in the budget is evidently held 
by every country. Important is its amount in relation to total 
expenditures. It has an influence on what part of the money the 
government has at its disposal is allocated according to plan 
and what part can be allocated ad hoc. Allocating money actually 
outside the framework of the approved budget undermines the 
original rationality of the structure of expenditures. I believe 
that the current amount of this reserve considerably exceeds 
this hypothetical minimum. 
  One can also dispute whether the budget manages the cash 
flow 
efficiently, that is, whether the kind of cash management that 
is used is really sound. Technically there exists a certain 
space of time between, for example, the collection of taxes and 
the use of these revenues for budget expenditures. At present, 
this money which is "suspended" in space is at the disposal of 
the Czech National Bank. It can, but does not always have to, 
use them to the greatest benefit of their owner--the Ministry of 
Finance. In developed countries one pays even for a one-day loan. 
  The 1994 budget was planned according to a medium-term 
strategy of fiscal policy. Among its main objectives is the 
maintenance of a stable economic environment, gradual reduction 
of direct taxation of entrepreneurs as well as households, 
reduction of the share of budget expenditures in the GDP, and 
the stabilization of the public debt in its absolute definition. 
  The national budget, the local budget, and the budget of the 
health insurance institutions are constructed as balanced 
budgets. Within the frameworks of the total revenues of the 
public budgets they represent the revenues of the state budget 
in the amount of Kc382.8 billion, and the revenues of the local 
budgets in the amount of Kc52 billion. The transfer of funds 
between the national budget and the local budgets represents the 
sum total of grants in the amount of Kc14 billion and grants 
from the subhead General Accounts Management in the amount of 
Kc77.1 billion, which is 20 percent of the revenues of the 
public budgets (excluding health insurance institutions). 
  The tax policy for 1994 is therefore built on a medium-term 
concept, which is based on a gradual reduction of the tax quota, 
and within its framework on the reduction of the burden of 
indirect taxes. 
  In 1994 that objective is being characterized by a reduction 
of the income tax rate for legal entities by 3 percent, 
reduction of the highest personal income tax rate also by 3 
percent, increase of the nontaxable portion of income for the 
personal income tax by Kc1,200, and the increase of the 
deduction for a minor or a child in school by Kc1,800. The 
adjustment of deductibles for personal income tax is partially 
compensated for by the discontinuation of the deduction for 
transportation, which makes the structure of this tax simpler. 
In addition, there is a reduction of the insurance rate. 
  In case of the value added tax, the ceiling above which its 
payment is required is being lowered from Kc6 million to Kc3 
million. That measure should improve the conditions for economic 
competition. Besides the increased income, however, we can 
expect also a certain increase of expenditures connected with 
the administration of this tax. 
  Further, some consumer taxes are being increased (for 
gasoline, alcohol, cigarettes). Special vehicles will not be 
subject to the road tax. 
  The overall impact of these measures is estimated at minus 
Kc3 billion for the national budget, and minus Kc0.7 million for 
the local budgets. 
<H5>  Local Budgets </H5>
  There are no basic changes in the local budgets in 1994. 
Somewhat more significant changes can be expected in connection 
with the creation of higher self-governing units. Some powers 
and revenues, which previously belonged to the local budgets and 
the state budget, will evidently be transferred to them.

  In 1994, there will be a change in the proportions of the 
allocation of tax revenues from dependent activity (i.e., the 
most important part of the personal income tax) collected within 
a district. The share of municipalities in the tax is being 
increased from 40 percent to 50 percent, and the share of the 
district offices is being cut. The Ministry of Finance is thus 
reacting to the gradual transfer of the financing of some 
activities (for example, health care facilities and facilities 
providing social care) from the district offices to 
municipalities. 
  The municipalities are gaining greater authority in 
determining the amount of property tax. They have, for example, 
the authority to set a higher tax rate for recreational 
facilities and buildings used for business activities. 
  Among the grants-in-aid is the contribution for public 
administration. The method of calculating it for the individual 
municipalities is not changed in comparison with the year 1993. 
There is also a grant for the construction of homes with 
community care services. This concerns the funds needed to 
complete their construction and to build new ones, the objective 
being to ensure that they are distributed equally over the 
entire territory. The last item in this category is the 
compensation for social benefits which the municipalities or the 
district offices pay to their residents. 
  The purpose of the targeted grants is to give municipalities 
and district offices a certain contribution for financing 
education, social services, and health care. In 1994 the 
contributions from the national budget for one student, for one 
bed in a social services institution, and for one bed in a 
selected health care facility (only those which are not financed 
through the insurance institutions) are being increased. 
  The increase of grants-in-aid and targeted grants is made at 
the cost of the equalization grant. That measure thus "favors" 
the municipalities that have the facilities over the 
municipalities which, mostly for historical reasons, have a 
smaller per capita revenue base and therefore fewer 
possibilities when it comes to distributing local public assets. 
  The decline of the importance of the territorial 
equalization 
grant means a limit on the leeway the Ministry of Finance has 
for compensating for significant differences in the per capita 
revenues of individual areas. The result is a further 
restriction of the principle of solidarity within the framework 
of local units and more emphasis on the principle of "merit," 
which, of course, is in the current conditions in the Czech 
Republic, as was already indicated above, considerably 
controversial. 
  In 1994 the Czech Republic does not face the kind of 
momentous changes such as was the division of the federation or 
the introduction of the new tax system. This year will 
overwhelmingly be devoted to the refinement of the measures 
adopted during the past several years. To make a big change is 
relatively simple. It requires especially consensus and 
determination. To convert these basic changes into a series of 
"small" changes, which only can determine whether the big 
changes were justified from the viewpoint of a longer 
perspective, is a much more demanding task, and not only of 
time. The year 1994 should be the beginning of this long 
journey. What role the budget will play in this process will 
only become clear from the first economic results of next year.

<F P=106> [Article by Milan Horalek, of the Research Institute for </F>
Labor and Social Affairs: "A Concept for Territorial Economic 
Recovery--A Project To Add 100,000 New Jobs"] 
  [Text] The market is shifting capital to advantageous 
portions of the state and is instrumental in creating problem 
territories. Inactivity in terms of recovery in some regions can 
be the source of new economic and social differences. 
Developmental projects should necessarily involve promising 
firms. 
  Three years of transformation have restored the 
macroeconomic 
balance (in the sense described by Walrasov) and has created a 
demanding environment for the attainment of microeconomic 
balances (in the Marshall sense). This historical operation, 
based on the restoration of actual ownership, its 
responsibility, and motivation, will culminate in the years 
immediately ahead. There thus ensues the "moment of truth," in 
which it will be shown, in specific terms, what has been done 
well, what has been done wrong, and what was forgotten. 
  Subsequent "macro" and "micro" adjustment efforts will be 
ongoing in the realistic territory of the new state and in its 
spatial components. The recovery and failure of companies are 
connected, albeit in an undesirable way, with the recovery and 
failure of jobs. No definitive regions or any regional policy 
exist, but more or less prosperous territories and areas develop 
and can be transformed into crisis regions. The unseen hand of 
the market directs capital streams toward more advantageous 
areas; in other areas, however, people must also live and 
prosper. The territory of the Czech Republic is also limited and 
a rare resource, which must be handled economically. 
  Over the past three years, there have been great structural 
changes in the market, changes in the areas of production and 
services, changes in the structure of employment. The latter 
have taken place even in the face of an enviable and criticized 
low unemployment rate. This development was aided by a specific 
policy and the activities of people, things that relieve the 
pressure on the labor market. The ranks of the unemployed did 
not include mothers, who may devote themselves to their children 
at home thanks to a social contribution--neither did the ranks 
of the unemployed include those working abroad or 120,000 of 
those who, with the support of labor offices, embarked upon new 
activities in newly created jobs. Thus, 4-5 percent of the 
people did not become unemployed but are working, for the most 
part, for low wages and are paying high taxes. However, given 
the ideal 3-percent unemployment rate (some consider it to be 
harmfully low), individual and contiguous territories have come 
into being in which an average of 30-60 unemployed can be 
offered only a single job. In the city of Prague, one applicant 
for work is statistically offered 10 jobs from the register and 
actually has 20 from which to choose. The creation of new jobs 
is progressing under influences that are different from those 
that created populations in the territories. Not all of these 
people can move without the development of depopulated and 
"uninhabited" territories. In looking at the situation depicted 
on the map, it must be clear that, in some territories, a 
situation is developing that makes further restructuring more 
difficult. For example, this holds true in the Saar region, the 
Rhine River region, Lotringen, Linz, and the Japanese 
steelmaking regions; restructuring was so successful in these 
areas that the so-called centrifugal effect gave rise to the 
development of thousands of small firms with hundreds of 
thousands of jobs in neighboring territories. In the "old 
territories" of United Germany, employment rose 5 percent over 
the past 12 years in 41 industrial centers but increased 17 
percent in its marginal territories! It was only as the result 
of such a centrifugal effect that employment in the Rhine River 
region was able to decline by 24 percent without causing 
economic or social reverberations. In our country, for example, 
Ostrava (with 5-percent unemployment) is surrounded by 
territories having a far higher rate of unemployment and a 
frozen rate of new job creation, even before restructuring, 
which is far worse. 
<H5>  Unemployment in the Territories </H5>
  For more than two years now, there has been express 
territorial differentiation regarding the development of 
unemployment and the creation of new jobs. Current records, by 
okres, documenting this development indicate that, on the one 
hand, okreses in which there are 10 jobs per applicant do exist 
and, on the other hand, there are okreses in which there are 30 
applicants for one job. However, in the smaller territorial 
entities, these differences are significantly greater. In the 
attached map [not reproduced here] showing the territorial 
breakdown of unemployment (as of 31 August 1993), territories 
with double-digit unemployment (dots), quadruple unemployment 
(crosses), and sextuple unemployment (black areas) can be 
clearly seen in comparison with the Republic average (3 percent). 
  An analysis of these critical and languishing territories 
shows that: 

  -  Long-term unemployment is growing there, and the number of 
jobs is declining; the creation of new jobs is negligible, 
temporary, and thus results in repeated unemployment. 
  -  The wage 
and income level of the population in these territories is 
declining; community budgets are shrinking, and resources for 
temporary employment in publicly beneficial type of work are 
disappearing. 
  -  In these territories, the number of families 
drawing payments to supplement their minimum level of the 
standard of living, with which it is possible to exist for a 
certain time but not to live normally in the long run, is 
growing. 
  -  These areas are not demonstrating growing buying power 
and demand for new products and services; the opportunities to 
develop new meaningful jobs are running up against the tight 
barriers created by a market that is progressively more 
impoverished. 
  -  In these areas, the infrastructure, 
transportation, communications, etc. is failing; "uninhabited" 
regions with devastated facilities, etc. are developing. 
  The above negative tendencies are gaining in strength and 
absent any new effective policy for territorial recovery will 
acquire socioeconomic emphasis, particularly in the area of 
Silesia and Moravia. Additional unemployment, over and above 
that shown on the map--that is to say, an increase in the Czech 
Republic by 0.5 percent during the period 1 September through 
the end of 1993--took place primarily in the more expanded 
crisis territories of Moravia and Silesia, in addition to 
several regions in Bohemia. This trend will continue at a 
greater rate of speed and will, apart from affecting less or 
more qualified workers, impact primarily on mothers and people 
with impaired health. 
  If we project the ongoing trends in the territorial 
development of unemployment and incorporate in them the 
inaccurate notions regarding the downsizing of existing firms, 
it is possible to express the notion, on an overall basis 
(macro), that, if the average rate of unemployment rises to 5 
percent, it will be distributed as follows: 


Czech Republic--5%     Bohemia--Less Than 3%   Moravia and Silesia--More 
                                               Than 9% 

                       Including:3 okreses     Including:Half of okreses 
                       with about 10%          with about 15% 
                       unemployment5           unemploymentOne-third of 
                       territories with        territories with about 25-30% 
                       about 15%               unemployment 
                       unemployment 

Note: Territories do not cover an entire okres but transcend the borders of 
two or three okreses. 


  A further "waiting for economic growth" can, particularly in 
more extensive territories in Moravia and Silesia, lead to 
weakening civic solidarity and support for economic 
transformation. The warning thus expressed is based not only on 
the analysis of the reasons for its development but also from 
the evaluation of further development projected for the 
territories of the Jesenik area, the Osoblah area, the Vitkov 
region, the Zivotice region, the Hlucin region, the Novy Jicin 
area, the Roznov area, the Belokarpaty area, the Breclav area, 
the Mikulov area, the Znojmo area, the Trebic area, etc. An 
evaluation of further possible development in West Bohemia, 
Central Bohemia, and North Bohemia territories indicates the 
possibility of a certain recovery over the next one to two years 
as a result of the transfer of thousands of new jobs from 
Germany (resulting from the advantage of comparatively lower 
costs for the German firms involved). In a number of the 
indicated regions of Czech okreses, it is more likely to be able 
to anticipate a recovery, an above-average growth of wages and 
income, a growth in prosperity. 
  In territories to the east of the Czech-Moravian highlands, 
capital interest in subsupplier or cooperative establishment of 
jobs is only extremely weak, the comparative advantages are 
negligible; and low wage costs do not predominate over transport 
and infrastructure disadvantages. 
  The anticipated restructuring, the downsizing and 
liquidation 
of some firms that do not show any structural promise for the 
future, in areas that are already in a crisis today will result 
in a negative multiplier effect--that is, in the liquidation of 
hundreds of small private firms. In the crisis territories, 
paradoxically, there was even the downsizing and liquidation of 
an entire series of formerly secondary and "splinter" production 
facilities, which occurred on the basis of "competitive 
privatization interests." Meanwhile, privatized companies with 
promising futures, located where the former "principal" 
enterprises were found, approximately 100 km away, are 
increasing their employment by hiring foreign workers. The 
growth of authorized as well as "black" foreign employment has 
grown to excessive and warning dimensions in 1993. The number of 
instances in which the provision of support for the development 
of new private firms has resulted in increased unemployment of 
foreign workers in areas of economic prosperity and increased 
unemployment in crisis areas is expanding. The excuse that 
workers have lower mobility is based, for the most part, on 
ignorance of the relevant demographic, economic, housing, and 
transport characteristics. Further inactivity regarding 
territorial recovery can, within a short time, result in new 
economic and social differences--that is to say, there can 
develop extensive territories of prosperity and extensive 
territories of failure. For purposes of revival of territories 
heading toward failure, it is necessary to fundamentally create 
external advantages for the influx of promising coproduction 
facilities and the development of positive multiplier effects. 
<H5>  Projects Involving the Recovery of Crisis Regions </H5>
  If we wish to avoid ineffective and expensive methods of 
state subsidies and support for territories that are falling 
behind--that is, the perfunctory kraj or okres understanding of 
subsidies "from above"--we must consider the creation of 
advantageous conditions for the establishment of effective jobs 
by existing promising firms as the economic and social solution. 
Such "external advantages" require the working out of 
territorial projects, on the basis of which those firms with 
good competitive prospects must be persuaded to establish 
operating facilities in crisis locations. 
  The plan for territorial recovery should contain the 
characteristics of localities for new firms on the territory, 
their product and technological aims and equipment, their 
infrastructure requirements, and personnel (professional) 
staffing, including supplemental and on-the-job training. All of 
this should then be accompanied by the appropriate financial 
budget. 
  In the majority of cases, for demographic, technical, 
infrastructure, and other reasons, this will involve the 
establishment primarily of small or medium-sized enterprises of 
a cooperative, subsupplier character in relatively small 
territories. In 1994, approximately 12 such projects for 
territorial recovery should be worked out and initiated--three 
in Bohemia and nine in Silesia and Moravia. As a general rule, 
the identified territories will incorporate parts of two or 
three okreses and will transcend "historical" borders of various 
lands (Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia)--that is to say, they will 
require cooperation even among several community and okres 
organizations, several branch offices of banks, labor offices, 
and appropriate facilities of okres offices. A so-called pilot 
project should determine the adequate form for the 
initiative-directing organ for the project, its composition, 
authorities, and responsibilities. 
  Okres labor offices and their branches will thus acquire new 
tasks involving the following: 

  -  The diagnosis of crisis territories, their labor, 
demographic, and professional potential. (Note: Existing records 
of job applicants do not provide all necessary data for this 
purpose.) 
  -  Participation in placing the order for and the 
financing of the project with a specialized firm. 
  -  Selection and 
combination of amended instruments of an active employment 
policy. 
  -  Recommendation of the optimal character of production 
and services for the working potential of the territory in 
question. 
  -  Evaluation of the mobility characteristics of workers 
and qualified estimates of multiplier effects of employment in 
the territory in question or in surrounding 
territories. 
  -  Initiative activities involved in directing the 
work on the project and its realization. 
  -  The acquisition of 
firms and those interested in moving to the territories--that is 
to say, collaboration with labor offices in those okreses in 
which the potential applicant firms, interested in establishing 
their operations in the projected crisis territory, are 
active. 
  -  Evaluation of the extent and the need for external 
advantages for the realization of the project--that is, 
investments for the acquisition of suitable areas, the 
infrastructure and buildings for the entry of new firms, 
"softer" credits, etc. 
  Identifying the territories for the recovery project will 
result even in a new degree of initiative, cooperative and 
financial participation on the part of the Directorate of 
Employment Services of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare 
of the Czech Republic. 
  The leadership of that ministry has made a fundamental 
recommendation for the necessary changes in the instruments 
governing the area of requalification, participation in public 
works programs, etc. It even supports the concept of 
intensifying territorial recovery that I have presented on 
behalf of the Research Institute for Labor and Social Affairs, 
together with the Directorate for Employment Services. Now, it 
is a question of finding the firms or institutes that will work 
out the project with our help--of course, in competition (for a 
contract price) so that the quality of these organizations might 
entice both our firms and foreign firms to establish new 
operations. 
  As far as foreign firms are concerned, let us be realists. 
The recession and unemployment, which are general, tend to 
prevent rather than stimulate the entrance of large-scale 
capacities. Not even the most recent "high-tech" technologies 
will come. Help for the crisis territories will come primarily 
out of our heads and as a result of our specialized efforts. If 
anyone has the desire to "help" the problem through the use of 
vulgar politicization, he should consider that we are talking 
here about jobs for 100,000 people and not of a few power 
positions.

<F P=106> [Article by Michal Kudernatsch: "Our Satisfaction Is Growing </F>
Only Slowly"] 
  [Text] According to older sociological investigations, 
significant fears regarding the consequences of the economic 
reform that have been initiated prevailed in this country as of 
1990. General feelings of insecurity were on the rise until June 
1991, when they culminated--a mere 11 percent of the population 
at that time considered its economic situation to be 
advantageous. Since that time, the satisfaction factor among the 
people is showing a rising trend. The most recent November 
investigations conducted by the Sociological Institute of the 
Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and by the Center for 
Empirical Research (STEM) on "economic expectations and 
attitudes," contains proof of this: Their situation is 
characterized as being favorable today by every fourth household 
and virtually 73 percent of the population believes that the 
economic and political changes will provide subsequent 
generations with a better future than that which the communist 
regime could provide them. That is not altered in the least even 
by the finding that one-half of our fellow citizens continues to 
designate its standard of living as being lower than it was 
prior to November 1989. 
  The creation of a democratic framework is the fundamental 
goal and, at the same time, represents the means of the reform. 
That postulate is also accepted by the majority of the 
people--71 percent of the citizens of the Czech Republic 
thought, in November, that society was developing in the proper 
direction and 63 percent even agree with the contention that the 
establishment of the foundations for democracy has already 
succeeded. Nevertheless, in this country the inclination toward 
a totalitarian method of thinking continues to survive. More 
than half of the population (53 percent) continues to agree with 
the statement that "it would be better for our country if, 
instead of discussions on various methods for solving the 
current situation, there were a firm hand and someone to clearly 
say what should be done." 
  We even find a similar "discrepancy" between the continuing 
high support for the government, which espouses the ideas of 
economic liberalism, and the actual orientation of the majority 
of society, which is increasingly paternalistic. Whereas in June 
1992 48 percent showed preference for the social market model, 
in which the state exerts a substantial influence over the 
economy, today that number has already risen to 59 percent. In 
contrast, ideas of a free market, in which the state is involved 
only to a minimum extent, is espoused today by only one-third of 
society (36 percent), which is 11 percent less than was the case 
last year in June. 
  Despite an overall high standard of living, significant 
social and economic differences are a characteristic feature of 
the market economy. At first glance, even here it seems that our 
society is prepared for this situation. The majority of people 
agree with the claim that it is correct for "truly capable 
people to have lots of money, even millions" (75 percent) and 
that "differences in salaries should be even increased" (66 
percent). At the same time, however, eight out of 10 people 
think that, in our country, "people grow rich primarily through 
dishonest methods." At the general sociological level, it can, 
therefore, be stated that in our society certain prejudices and 
embitterments against rich people continue to be strongly 
rooted. Incidentally, that conclusion is confirmed even by yet 
another finding of the investigation: a strong inclination 
within society toward paternalism. 
  An almost banal answer exists to the question why Czech 
society frequently adopts paradoxic and confusing attitudes 
toward economic issues: The reason lies in the gradual profiling 
of disparate social strata, which can be demonstrated, in a 
simplified manner, by noting the difference between latent 
paternalism and liberalism. (These attitudes are designated as 
being latent because not a single one of them is openly 
proclaimed, but is, rather, the result of the analysis of 
responses to substantive questions.) We briefly define 
paternalism as over-reliance on the role of the state, even in 
areas of social and economic life which are primarily the 
responsibility of the individual. In the investigation, 
paternalism was therefore characterized by positive responses to 
questions such as: Should the state officially set prices more 
vigorously, should it assure everyone who wants to work a job, 
or whether the state should guarantee people a place to live? By 
contrast, the liberal orientation stresses the role of the 
individual in all spheres of life and, in the investigation, is 
characterized, for example, by the agreement with the contention 
that "everyone is primarily to blame for their own poverty." 
  Data obtained in this manner indicate that, in our country, 
some 59 percent of the population are inclined toward latent 
paternalism, whereas 41 percent are inclined toward latent 
liberalism. And if we compare the data with the previously made 
statement--that six out of 10 people prefer the so-called social 
version of the market economy--then we find that virtually 80 
percent of those who favor the social market economy actually 
visualize this concept as being the directive functioning of the 
state--much as we know it from the past. 
  Not even the question as to the extent to which the 
paradoxic 
views of people and their inclination toward latent paternalism 
or liberalism are determined by their political orientations is 
without interest. The respondents in the investigation, 
therefore, were tasked to list their political orientation. The 
results indicate that a large portion of the people tend to 
identify with the political center. However, that group is not 
characterized by any kind of more compact orientation and their 
views are somewhat unclear and frequently confused. (And that is 
not to even say anything about the fact that 33 percent of the 
people with paternalistic views consider themselves to be 
rightist in their orientation.) 
  A significant finding which has been statistically confirmed 
is also the fact that as "paternalists" as well as "liberalists" 
these people have their own socioeconomic hinterland, so to 
speak. Of course, there can be no talk of a unilateral "class" 
determinism, but, nevertheless, a certain connection between the 
attitude and the social anchoring of an individual is 
discernible from the investigation. The entrepreneurial and 
managerial layer, for example, is characterized by its liberal 
attitude, whereas the cooperative sector is paternalistic. Much 
the same is true of property: The more property a person owns, 
the greater the inclination toward liberalism. However, in 
addition to economic aspects, it is also possible to find 
additional statistically significant factors here which tend to 
influence the formation of views. In the liberally oriented 
group, younger people and people in their middle years up to 45 
tend to predominate. Also, education is important: Virtually 74 
percent of the respondents with a basic education are 
paternalistic in their orientation, whereas 57 percent of people 
with advanced school education are liberal in their orientation. 
  Despite the fact that attitudes toward the reform are 
reflected in the social structure of society, it would be 
misleading to claim that this involves rigidly separated blocks. 
In other words: The investigation indicated that the differences 
are not so great as to enable us to say that the conflict 
between paternalism and liberalism is a dispute between the poor 
and the rich and that it thus seriously threatens the stability 
of the Czech Republic.

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Frydl: "Companies Located in the Czech </F>
Republic Made Direct Foreign Investments Last Year of $45.2 
Million"] 
  [Text] Compared with 1992, this is almost a 
100-percent growth rate. Joint-stock corporations and 
corporations with limited liability are the most active in this 
area. For the most part, however, these investments are in the 
tertiary sphere, the acquisition of production capacities is 
sporadic. Two-thirds of the investments are of a material 
character. 
  Property participation by Czech foreign exchange nationals 
abroad--in other words, direct investments from the Czech 
Republic--amounted to $45.2 million for 1993, according to 
preliminary data, according to what the director of the Foreign 
Exchange Department of the Czech National Bank, Jiri Zimola, 
told our newspaper. According to him, Czech enterprises are 
substantially more active in this regard in comparison to 
previous years. In 1992, approximately $28 million was invested 
abroad, and, in 1991, investments abroad amounted to only $3 
million. The period 1992 and part of 1993 was a preparatory one 
for privatization. This is also reflected in the lower degree of 
interest on the part of state enterprises in activities abroad, 
the director noted. In 1993, more than 90 percent of the 
investments were accounted for by stock corporations and 
corporations with limited liability. The share of state 
enterprises in this endeavor was about 1 percent. 
  Last year, the largest investments abroad were made, for 
example, by Skoda Mlada Boleslav (in Great Britain), the 
Prachovice Cement and Lime Kilns (Netherlands), Invest Plzen 
(Russia), Strojimport (Austria), CSKD Intrans (Slovakia), the 
Maritime Navigation Enterprise (Malta), and the Stone Industry 
of Brno (Croatia). Last year, the largest investments were made 
in Malta, where a maritime freighter was purchased and, at the 
same time, registered. Other than that, the top investments were 
made in Russia, Slovakia, and Great Britain. 
  The absolute majority of investments are aimed at business 
and services because enterprises are attempting to use them in 
support of their exports, according to J. Zimola. Meanwhile, the 
acquisition of production capacities is more isolated for the 
time being. One of the few examples of this type of investment 
can be the Vitkovice Ironworks investment in Algeria, the 
realization of which is in the negotiation phase for the time 
being. Because investments in the tertiary sphere are 
financially relatively undemanding, the overall value of direct 
investments is not overly great, the director added. In 
relationship to the volume of foreign exchange flowing into the 
Czech Republic, these investments represent substantially only a 
negligible amount. However, the interest in production 
investments, and, thus, the overall volume of direct 
investments, should grow together with the progress made in the 
privatization of large industrial enterprises, he added. 
  According to the foreign exchange law, all investment 
activities abroad are subject to foreign exchange permission 
issued by the Czech National Bank, following negotiations with 
the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Commerce. Primarily, 
consideration is given to project investment returns that, when 
dealing with investments in the tertiary sphere, are currently 
running at about two to three years; in the case of production 
investments, returns are running at four to five years. The 
Czech National Bank is also interested in the form of the 
investments. Last year, only a small portion (22.9 percent) was 
realized financially. Some 63 percent of the investments were 
material in character (primarily by providing mechanical 
equipment). The remainder involves principally the 
capitalization of accounts receivable.

<F P=106> [Article by Alexej Balek, of the Institute for Economic </F>
Policy: "Agriculture in the 1990's: Trends, Dynamics, and the 
Channeling of Its Development"] 
  [Text] Restructuring cannot get by without 
involvement of the state, and reforestation cannot get by 
without a global concept. Reduction of the weight of agriculture 
in the economy calls for a directed process. The number of 
workers in agriculture will be declining. 
  Existing problems will continue in agriculture throughout 
the 
1990's, and new problems will develop and expand, including 
global, economic, social, ecological, and landscape-forming 
problems. They will impact upon the lives of people in this 
branch of the economy in adjacent sectors and areas and will 
even impact on territorial questions. The weight of the 
extraproduction, extraeconomic significance of agriculture will 
increase. 
<H5>  Stagnation </H5>
  Agriculture will be primarily facing stagnation of food 
consumption in this country and West Europe. The stagnation of 
food consumption is the result of both economic and systems 
causes (for example, a change in the structure of expenditures 
by the population, temporarily lower real incomes for a 
significant portion of the population), as well as demographic 
ones (stability or decline in population numbers, deterioration 
of the age structure of the population). Exceptions to this 
stagnation will be the production of fruit, vegetables, and milk 
in the vicinity of large towns and agglomerations, where good 
sales opportunities will exist. 
  Czech agriculture will have to deal with foreign competition 
to a greater extent--competition not only from the West but also 
from the East (for example, Ukraine). Efforts will increase to 
sell foodstuffs in our country that are unsalable in the West. 
This problem will be connected with the competitiveness of Czech 
exports of industrial commodities and services. The described 
situation will bring about the necessity for restructuring 
agricultural production, for limiting areas to be seeded, for 
changes in the structure of livestock production, etc. 
<H5>  Restructuring </H5>
  Limiting cropland areas poses the question as to what is to 
be done with them. There is the possibility of reforestation, 
utilization for recreational purposes, agrotourism, energy 
production, etc. These directions for utilizing and modifying 
the landscape need not result in adequate economic effects (at 
least from the medium-range viewpoint); on the contrary, they 
will be resource-intensive. 
  In the short period of two to four years, land left to lie 
fallow will be the source of a spread of weeds, will lead to 
higher costs in plant production and to the necessity of 
multiplying the use of herbicides and chemicals to care for the 
land. This will have an influence on the quality of the 
environment. 
  For many reasons, changes in the landscape that involve 
complex questions with a number of tie-ins and interconnections 
can very likely not be left to unrestrained development. 
Reforestation cannot get by without a certain concept that would 
coordinate various interests. This process will be impossible 
without incursion on the part of the state. This is also 
necessary because this will also involve organizational and 
coordination tasks. Reforestation will require expenditures that 
will not result in a return on investment for 60 to 80 years, 
something that will not be lucrative for entrepreneurial 
entities. 
  The establishment of water reservoirs, of small and 
medium-size hydroelectric and wind-driven electric power plants, 
can bring definite as well as economic results sooner than can 
be obtained through reforestation, but will be capital-intensive 
and, in a number of cases, not even hold a promise of average 
profits. But these will be projects that are socially beneficial 
and, in many cases, urgently needed. It will be necessary to 
reach conclusions as to how their realization can be assured 
(taxes, subsidies, grants, etc.). 
  In a broader and longer-term context, orientation toward 
nonfood-industry production purposes (for example, the 
cultivation of biomass for energy purposes) is one of the ways 
in which agriculture can move. However, this is dependent upon a 
number of factors (technical factors, technological factors, 
organizational factors, research, legislative factors, capital 
resources). 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  In addition to questions having to do with land, it must be 
anticipated that the number of people active in agriculture will 
continue to decline. In 1970, the number of workers in 
agriculture in the Czech Republic amounted to 720,000; in 1980, 
there were 560,000; in 1990, 491,000; and in the year 2000, the 
number of agricultural employees could decline significantly 
below 300,000. (The departure of people from agriculture causes 
problems involving their placement and requalification.) A 
similar fate will befall the relatively significant number of 
people active in the foodstuffs industry, engineering, 
chemistry, and other branches that tie in with agriculture. 
  It can be rationally anticipated that the standard of living 
of the population working in agriculture (cooperative farmers, 
private farmers, or hired help) will, when compared to other 
groups of the population, deteriorate relatively on the average. 
The problems in agriculture will influence the entire social 
situation. 
  Agriculture will be a branch that will be reducing the pace 
of the national economy as a whole. Stagnation in the 
consumption of food, the minimizing of consumption on the part 
of the agricultural population, weakened demand for agricultural 
machinery, chemical products for agriculture, etc. will all be 
exerting their influence. 
<H5>  There Are Not Only Economic Connections </H5>
  In formulating agricultural policy, it will no longer be 
possible to ignore the principles of food security and 
self-sufficiency of the Czech state. In the 1990's, 
international relations will also be conflicting in character. 
It is also not possible to exclude the occurrence of natural 
events or catastrophes, which could prevent the importation of 
foodstuffs, etc. 
  In formulating the agricultural policy of the state, it is 
suitable to take into account not only the efficiency of our own 
agricultural production in comparison with the efficiency of 
exports of industrial goods necessary to assure the importation 
of foodstuffs, but also the extraproduction task of agriculture. 
It is possible that the development of production forces in 
Czech agriculture could result in greater economic and 
extraeconomic effects than could be achieved as a result of the 
above-mentioned export of industrial goods and services in 
exchange for the importation of foodstuffs. 
  Orientation toward reducing the weight of agriculture in the 
national economy is a process that should be directed. The 
formulation of medium-term and long-term agricultural policy 
must be based on all decisive interconnections and not just on 
economic factors.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Scekic: "Welcome Confederation"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb -- "The Social Democratic Party of Croatia 
generally approves of the agreement between Granic and Silajdzic 
reached in Washington, but it must note that the present nature 
of the agreement is contrary to official Croatian policies as 
they have been to this day. Thus it appears to have been imposed 
from the outside." That statement was made last Friday at a 
press conference by Antun Vujic, president of the party. 
  Commenting on the agreement, Vujic said that it is almost 
identical to the policies of his party in relation to Bosnia and 
Herzegovina because the Social Democratic Party of Croatia was 
always in favor of recognizing the states formed on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia and the borders between them. 
As far as the future confederation of Croatia and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina that may eventually happen, the party leader 
stressed that it is welcome as an expression of political, 
geographic, and economic interests, but it must be founded on 
the principle of strict preservation of the sovereignty and 
individuality of the two states because too many sacrifices have 
been made, and Croatian sovereignty will not be lost easily. 
However, the possible confederation must not have any 
connection with the confederation of Croatia, because the future 
of the UNPA zones can not be resolved in the same package. "The 
international community must clearly state what obligations it 
has toward the integration of the so-called Krajina with 
Croatia," Vujic said. 
  The merger of SDP (Social Democratic Party) and SDH (Social 
Democratic Party of Croatia) was also discussed at the press 
conference. Vujic pointed out that the merger provides the 
possibility of securing a new political area, and it will create 
a strong left on the Croatian political scene, which is very 
much needed.

<F P=106> [Article by B. Lapondic: "Danger of Dividing Bosnia and </F>
Herzegovina"] 
  [Text] At a news conference last Friday, Ivan Kegljevic, 
president of the Croatian Christian Democratic Party, said that 
"the Granic-Silajdzic agreement that was signed in Washington 
should be supported only as explained by Dr. Mate Granic, 
Croatian foreign minister and vice president. He speaks of a 
federation whose creation would include the Serbs. By contrast, 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, in his address to the nation, 
excluded Serbian participation in the federation. That 
represents the danger of creation of a Serbian republic within 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is not at all acceptable." 
  "Such an approach by the Croatian president," Kegljevic 
continued, "opens the possibility of the division of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and thus threatens peace. As long as the agreement 
proposes borders with Serbia, which is obvious in Tudjman's 
statement, it does not propose a federation, because the borders 
themselves exclude the possibility a federation. The result of 
cramming the 60 percent of the population that is Croatian or 
Muslim into only 30 percent of the territory would be continued 
war." 
  The Croatian Christian Democratic Party rejects the part of 
the agreement that deals with the confederation of Croatia and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina because the party leader believes that it 
violates the Constitution of Croatia.

  [Text] Mostar -- Kresimir Zubar, president of the 
Presidential Council of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, 
and Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic received Tvrtko Nevjestic, 
president of the Croatian Coordination Council in Sarajevo, to

  Nevjestic informed Zubak and Prlic about the work and

civil and other rights of about 30,000 Croats in Sarajevo. They 
concluded that there is an urgent need to preserve the complete 
unity of the entire Croatian nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
order to protect its national interests and equality in relation 
to the other two constituent peoples, especially regarding the 
approach to and execution of the Washington agreement.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] This is Dobroslav Paraga 
[president of one faction of the Croatian Rights Party] on the 
Washington agreement: "The complete turnaround achieved in 
Washington is a historic event, a final solution, not only to 
the problem of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but a 
redefinition of the situation in the Balkans. When I speak of a 
turnaround, I have in mind the agreement signed in Washington, 
which represents a complete negation of the present policy of 
Dr. Franjo Tudjman, the policy that allied itself with the 
Serbian chetniks at the expense of the Muslims. Because that 
policy enabled not only the chetniks, but also the Russians, to 
break through to the Adriatic, the United States has finally 
realized that the basic principles of the post-world war order 
are being destroyed, that Tudjman's pact with Belgrade was 
destroying Yalta and that the West was losing its spheres of 
interest. Therefore, the United States and its allies have 
joined forces in the defense of their strategic interests to 
revive the Yalta Agreement -- extending their sphere of interest 
to the Drina River. How strong the U.S. influence is can be 
judged by the fact that Granic was `brought' by plane to 
Washington, where he was presented with the agreement that 
renders the present Croatian foreign policy, as well as the pact 
with Milosevic, irrelevant."

Alternative"] 
  [Text] Zagreb -- At the HRZ [Croatian Republican Community] 
news conference, Mario Ostojic, deputy president, and Boris 
Koznjak, representative of the headquarters, stated: "During the 
last two years, Croatia made many amateurish moves on the 
diplomatic and political scene, especially regarding 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most often there was talk about success, 
often in euphoric terms, even though our policy experienced 
failure in the domestic and international arena. The present 
preliminary agreements on federation and confederation forced on 
us by the United States, although arriving quite late, are 
better than the alternative -- a formation of some kind of a new 
Yugoslavia prepared for us by the Brussels technocrats." 
  The HRZ welcomes the agreement with the Bosniak Muslims on 
federation as well as a future confederation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. It warns that one should 
nevertheless be cautious, particularly when it comes to the 
confederation and relations with Serbs. It is necessary to 
strengthen the Croatian-Bosnian defense alliance in order to 
help neutralize the Serbian offensive wedge pointed toward Zadar 
and Sibenik and thwart other Serbian plans in their program for 
the creation of a Greater Serbia, which they have never 
renounced.

<F P=106> [Article by Marko Barisic: "What Is the Price of </F>
Confederation?"] 
  [Text] Although it is already a week since the signing of 
the Washington agreement, there is still confusion in the 
Croatian public about the possible establishment of a 
Croatian-Bosnian federation and then its confederation with the 
Republic of Croatia. When we add to that that groups of experts 
have already begun to work in Vienna and by 15 March were 
supposed to work out the remaining details as to the 
interpretation of the various articles, and delineate the 
borders of the cantons in the federation, one gets the 
impression that the public, the political parties, and 
professionals are quite surprised by the speed at which the 
United States, which authored the idea of this political 
breakthrough, has been leading the entire project toward its 
conclusion. One consequence of that confusion and the speed with 
which events have been taking place, and there is good reason to 
refer to them as fateful, and of the lack of complete 
information about essential details of such agreements, is that 
a vacuum has been formed in the Croatian Republic concerning the 
real scope of these intragovernmental and intergovernmental 
agreements. Various interpreters, depending on their past 
political position, have been expressing satisfaction at the 
indications of a Croatian-Muslim alliance, or on the other hand 
outright fear that the Croats, again in the kitchen of Western 
policy, just as in 1918, will be tricked into a forced alliance 
first with the Muslims and perhaps also with the Serbs. Is 
Croatian Foreign Minister Granic, who was the first to sign the 
Washington agreement, thereafter to call upon the Bosnian Serbs 
from Paris to join him (which horrified the public), an 
experienced diplomat who knows the consequences of what he does, 
or on the other hand is he a synonym of the policy suggested by 
the phrase "a goose in the fog"? 
  That is why we need to see what has been signed. The Croats 
in Bosnia- Herzegovina, according to the preliminary agreement, 
have entered the Federal Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a 
sovereign people. This is a normal state with a federal system 
(the federal units are cantons) and with a strong central power. 
All the essential powers come under the jurisdiction of that 
government, which will be in Sarajevo: foreign affairs, national 
defense (joint supreme command), economic policy, finance (a 
single currency), and energy. The central government and the 
cantons will join together in controlling human rights, health 
care, building roads and communications, citizenship, tourism, 
and, and this is very essential, immigration policy. The cantons 
will have jurisdiction over the police (which will have cantonal 
insignia), upbringing and education, culture, and housing 
policy. Housing policy is very important, because, for example, 
under this agreement the central government in Sarajevo cannot 
build several buildings in Neum without a permit from the canton 
government, nor can persons from other cantons acquire the right 
to move into Neum (or other places) without consent of the 
canton government. Those regulations are very essential because 
of the Croatian fear that under the cover of the federation 
there will be a change in the ethnic composition of the cantons, 
that is, that the Muslims, because of their greater numbers and 
faster population growth, will move into the Croatian cantons 
and thus alter the ethnic composition, and the consequence, 
according to Radovan Pavic, would be to turn the federation into 
Muslimania. According to chairman Zubak of the presidential 
council of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna (whose bodies 
will function in the transitional period until the agreement is 
implemented), there will be three cantons with a predominant 
Croatian majority: Herzegovina, the Sava Valley, and central 
Bosnia (where the Muslims will also have their canton). The 
central government, which, as we have seen, will have large 
powers, will be set up on a parity basis; the Croats will have 
at least one-third of the ministers in the government, and if 
the prime minister is a Muslim, his deputy is a Croat and vice 
versa. 
<H5>  Fear of the Bottomless Hole </H5>
  The legislative body (parliament) would consist of two 
houses: the Chamber of Nationalities (the same number from each 
nationality) and the House of Representatives (on a proportional 
basis). The president of that federation would be a Muslim one 
year and a Croat the next, but the office of president would not 
have broad powers. That state, the federation, and this is part 
of the same arrangement, would enter into a confederal alliance 
with the Republic of Croatia. 
  To what extent will the federation of Croats and Muslims, 
devastated by war, with an economy that differs utterly from the 
Croatian economy, rich only in timber and a poor kind of ore, be 
a burden on Croatia? Croatia, that is, has bad experience with 
the constant financing of the underdeveloped republics of 
Yugoslavia, which were usually a bottomless hole. So, will this 
be a repetition of history that would affect the economic 
stability of the Croatian state, or are other relations 
involved? The provisions of the confederal agreement, under 
which a customs and monetary union and defense agreement would 
be established between the two states, which "would not change 
their international identity or legal individuality by 
establishing the confederation," are the occasion for such fears. 
  Lawyers say that they will always be two states, economists 
are more skeptical in this regard and say that a customs union 
and monetary union envisage a single market, that is, an entire 
space in which people will move and trade without restriction. 
If a customs union is established, then that means that on the 
border between Croatia and the federation there will be no 
customhouses, but only police control. And a monetary union does 
not mean that one currency will be in use on the territory of 
the confederation: Economists cite the example of the European 
Union, in which for the present each state has its own currency, 
although they have entered into a monetary union, and the ECU 
[European Currency Unit] is only an accounting unit. And then 
the military alliance, as stated in the confederal treaty, 
includes "coordination of defense policies and establishment of 
joint supreme commands in case of war or immediate danger of war 
for any party." To be realistic, that type of cooperation 
(military) could take effect immediately, because both sides are 
threatened by Serbian aggression. Does this mean that the 
Croatian Army should go to war in eastern Bosnia if the Muslims 
want to get back territory from which the Serbs have ethnically 
expelled them, or would the army of the federation (it is not 
clear as yet how it will be organized) or a part of it, the Army 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, go to liberate Knin or Vukovar if 
Croatia invited it on the basis of the confederal treaty? 
<H5>  Who Will Repay the Debts? </H5>
  The most unclear part of the treaty relates to economic 
cooperation. Although they will remain in formal terms two 
states with independent governments and legislation, the treaty 
also contains a provision that "Croatia and the federation will 
adopt internal regulations as soon as possible and conclude 
accords necessary to establish" a customs union and monetary 
union. Which nevertheless means that those internal regulations 
would not be altogether independent, but would have to be 
"reconciled." Would it not be a consequence of that 
reconciliation that Croatia would nevertheless be deprived of a 
part of its sovereignty, especially when we bear in mind that 
the entire "Washington arrangement" was nevertheless imposed on 
it? Will the federation repay its debts alone, or will this be 
done together with Croatia? Croatia furnished Yugoslavia, 
through tourism and an economy to some extent oriented toward 
export, 80 percent of the inflow of foreign exchange (which is 
why financial institutions in the world were against the 
separation of Croatia from Yugoslavia). Will this same procedure 
be repeated on behalf of the foreign exchange liquidity of the 
federation, which will have a hard time earning foreign exchange 
in view of the fact that its industry is old and mainly military 
in nature? economists wonder. Unless Croatia aids reconstruction 
and development of the federation, an economic gap will be 
created between the two states: This could result in a quite 
considerable emigration of Croats from the federation (following 
trends which existed even in the past), and the consequence of 
that in turn could be the disappearance of Croats from Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, the demographers warn. This kind of Washington 
agreement is being interpreted as an American (but also 
Croatian) gift of Herceg-Bosna to the Muslims. Opponents of this 
kind of thinking point their finger at the powers of the canton 
governments, which have the right to regulate moves from one 
canton to another and to oversee housing policy. The ethnic 
composition of the population on that territory would mainly be 
altered from what it was in the former federation. They say that 
Croatia would get a new market for its products, that it would 
also get manpower which it lacks, and as the stronger and more 
highly developed it would impose its interests through the 
economic flows of the federation, not the other way about, even 
if the same currency is used over the entire space of the 
confederation. 
<H5>  Promises and Guarantees </H5>
  Then they add the international aspect of the entire 
Washington package. Croatia, according to them, extricated 
itself from a very difficult situation at the last moment. It 
was threatened by sanctions, it was isolated from European 
financial and political associates. It had no true ally that 
would support it concerning recovery of the occupied 
territories. And in Bosnia and Herzegovina it could not come out 
the victor in an exhaustive war with the Muslims. Now the 
situation has changed altogether, they say, an intergovernmental 
alliance has been created against the main enemy--Milosevic and 
his satellites. The offers of membership in the European Union 
and NATO through the Partnership for Peace are the guarantee of 
success. Yes, they are told by opponents, but those are all 
promises, where are the guarantees that the Croatian-Muslim 
federation will embrace more than the present 30 percent of 
territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who says that the United 
States will not force Croatia in the same way to conclude a 
federation with Krajina, what if the Bosnian Serbs, who will 
make a confederation with Serbia, also decide to join the 
federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina? Is that not Yugoslavia all 
over again? 
  Those are not the only quandaries and murky areas associated 
with this federal-confederal tale. There are also analyses of 
the distribution of spheres of interest of the great powers 
associated with it. It remains to be seen how long and in what 
fashion this governmental marriage of Croats and Muslims will 
last and what the consequences will be. Still, one thing is 
certain. It was imposed by the United States, so that it has a 
flavor of punishment for both sides. The Muslims wanted their 
own state with an outlet to the Sava and to the sea. The Croats 
wanted Banovina, their own state in which after a long time they 
would live without an alliance with other nationalities. On this 
occasion, this was not made possible either for the Muslims, 
because of the danger of radical Islam, or for the Croats, 
presumably because of their historical habit of always having 
trouble with certain multinational communities, defending 
Christianity, or drawing someone into Europe. It does not sound 
very optimistic to speak of the confederation as a punishment. 
Once again, just as in 1918, the Americans have created a fog, 
for the moment it is unclear who will get the role of the 
"goose."
