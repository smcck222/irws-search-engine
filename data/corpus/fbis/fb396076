<F P=106> [Article by Betsy Lawn al-Ma'luf: "Morocco Has Become the </F>
EC's Mexico"] 
  [Text] The International Monetary Fund [IMF], which is 
subordinate to the World Bank, says that private investments 
continued to pour into the developing nations in 1992, for the 
fifth year in a row. The IMF's figures show that the investments 
of the large U.S. investment firms in the portfolios of the 
developing nations rose from $1.5 billion to $120 billion during 
the last five years. Furthermore, Morocco has greatly benefited 
from the interest of private investors, and has come to be 
called "the EC's Mexico." 
  In an IMF study dealing with the flow of investments to 46 
developing nations over the course of five years, it was 
reported that this flow of investments was accompanied by a boom 
in direct foreign investments, and that, after the value of 
investments had totalled $25 billion, they came to total of $50 
billion, according to an IMF newsletter that is published from 
time to time and that was published in Washington last Wednesday. 
  Analysts working for the IMF make a connection between the 
big influx of foreign investments and the economic reforms 
adopted by a large number of the developing nations which have 
strengthened the economies of these nations, and the fact that 
about 40 percent of the economic growth experienced by the world 
at the present time is taking place in the developing nations, 
since a large number of the industrial nations themselves are 
drowning in the swamp of an economic recession. 
  Guy Pfeifermann, a high-level economics expert in the IMF, 
points out that "investors who are looking for investment 
opportunities are closely examining and scrutinizing these 
markets, and this is something that is only natural." 
  Most of the increase in private investments is attributable 
to domestic sources, but the huge increase in direct foreign 
investments in the developing nations, in Pfeifermann's opinion, 
represents a "historic turning point" in which investors are 
showing that they have complete confidence in the economies of 
the developing nations, and this is a confidence which did not 
exist five years ago. 
  Pfeifermann also calls our attention to the fact that the 
investment portfolios in the developing nations, during the last 
two years, have experienced a vertical upswing. This fact is 
closely related to the attractive investment climate that exists 
in a large number of the developing nations, and is closely 
related to the lowering of U.S. interest rates and decisions by 
the large U.S. investment firms to diversify their investment 
portfolios. 
  The IMF's figures indicate that these firms' investments in 
the portfolios of the developing nations have increased from 
$1.5 billion to $120 billion during the last five years. 
However, in view of the fact that these investments constitute 
only 0.5 percent of their total investment portfolios, observers 
find no reason to worry about whether or not these investments 
will continue. 
  The big surge in private investments appeared mostly in East 
Asia and Latin America. The flow of investments to the nations 
of North Africa and the Middle East remained average or below 
average in relation to the 46 nations covered by the IMF study, 
but there was a great discrepancy in the amount of the 
investments that flowed into each of these countries (in North 
Africa and the Middle East). 
  Morocco benefited greatly from interest on the part of the 
private investors. It has recently experienced great improvement 
in this regard and has become, or almost become, "the EEC's 
Mexico," because clothes-producing firms have set up plants in 
Morocco in order to export their products to the EEC, according 
to Pfeifermann. 
  Lebanon has stood out among the other nations, and the IMF 
believes that the beginnings of prosperity exist there. 
  Pfeifermann points out that a recently-published government 
report indicates that the rate of economic growth in Lebanon 
surpassed 7 percent last year. He says: "There is no doubt that 
Lebanon is once again having an economic boom after its civil 
war came to an end. One positive sign is that a number of 
Lebanese companies have asked the IMF for financial aid of the 
type that the IMF usually provides." 
  But Egypt, on the other hand, earned no praise from the 
analysts working for the IMF. Robert Miller, one of the chief 
analysts who contributed to the study, says that "Egypt was far 
less promising than the other nations in the area because of the 
enormous number of state-owned establishments, which are moving 
only very slowly in the direction of privatization." 
  Miller is worried about the negative effect that political 
problems in Egypt are having on the investment climate there. 
  Those participating in the study say that the Middle East, 
as 
a whole, has been hurt by the world's falling oil prices. 
  The study was confined to 46 nations, chiefly because the 
information utilized was not available in the case of the other 
developing nations. The study analyzes in detail the situation 
in five Middle Eastern and North African nations, which are 
Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Iran, and Turkey. One of the criteria 
used by the study to evaluate the capability of any of the 
economies to attract foreign investments was that of comparing 
these investments to the GNP. 
  In Egypt, private investments were 7.8 percent of the GNP in 
1992. This is a low percentage in comparison with the 
percentages in Thailand (32 percent) and Korea (25 percent). The 
rate of private investments in Tunisia was 10.7 percent of the 
GNP, and in Turkey this figure was 11.7 percent. The average 
rate for the 46 nations covered by the study was 13.2 percent. 
  Taking the above-mentioned into consideration, Morocco's 
rate 
of private investments to its GNP was 13.4 percent (that is, 
above average). Perhaps Iran's good performance, which was 
accompanied by a noticeable increase in public investments, was 
in response to the reforms that in 1992 appeared to evidence 
considerable success. But it is also possible that this good 
performance is attributable to false information or statistics, 
according to officials in the IMF. 
  The study draws attention to the influx of private 
investments in a number of nations in the Middle East or nations 
adjacent to it. The performance of the Turkish stock market was 
the strongest performance shown by any of the young markets 
during the last few years. But this stock market has lost 60 
percent of its value in U.S. dollars during the last few months, 
a fact that indicates that its performance has been similar to 
that of a great many of the young markets in that it is 
capricious and not subject to controls.

<F P=106> [Article by Suzana Tarbush: "British Aerospace Aspires To </F>
Sell Saudi Arabia EFA 2000; 48 Tornado Aircraft Being Built for 
Kingdom"] 
  [Text] London--British Aerospace Corporation sources have 
said that they hope to persuade the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to 
conclude a deal, to be implemented at the beginning of the next 
century, to sell the Kingdom a number of EFA 2000, a European 
fighter being developed by a joint 
British-German-Italian-Spanish project. The four countries 
developing the aircraft have pledged to buy 600 of the planes in 
the event it is produced. The company hopes to sell an 
additional 400-450 to a number of countries, including Saudi 
Arabia. 
  There are currently seven experimental prototypes of the EFA 
2000. Development of the plane is faced with numerous obstacles. 
However, it has been decided that the plane will make its first 
sortie, which has been postponed repeatedly, by the end of next 
April. It is estimated that by the start of the next century, 
Saudi Arabia will have its own aircraft industry. British 
Aerospace hopes that the Kingdom will be able by then to 
participate in the technologies and production of the EFA 2000. 
  British Aerospace is currently manufacturing 48 Tornado 
military aircraft for Saudi Arabia as part of an accord 
announced last January. The cost of each Tornado, an 
interceptor-bomber, is 20 million pounds sterling. 
  The British firm still hopes that Saudi Arabia will confirm 
its previous request to purchase 60 more Hawk training aircraft. 
It is evident that with its request to purchase 48 Tornado 
aircraft, plus 72 F-15's from the United States, Saudi Arabia 
will need additional training aircraft soon. 
  British Aerospace will deliver the 48 Tornado's in 1997 and 
1998 at the rate of two aircraft monthly. In addition to 
producing the Tornado's, the firm is making efforts to enhance 
this type of fighter plane. The company is currently making 
improvements on 17 out of 72 Tornado's previously purchased by 
Saudi Arabia. 
  British weapons exports to Saudi Arabia are part of the 
al-Yamamah Program, which is being implemented in accordance 
with the two "memoranda of understanding" concluded by Britain 
and Saudi Arabia in 1985 and 1988. In addition to weapons sales, 
the program includes training plans. British Aerospace is the 
main company in al-Yamamah Program, and has 3,500 employees in 
Saudi Arabia currently. 
  In the first phase of the program Saudi Arabia acquired from 
British Aerospace 72 Tornado aircraft, including 48 designed as 
interceptor-bombers and 24 designed for air defense operations. 
Saudi Arabia also acquired 30 Hawk-65 training aircraft. 
  The second memorandum of understanding covered the latest 48 
Tornado's, which were requested last year, and the 60 Hawks 
which the corporation is trying to get confirmed. 
  British Aerospace directors say that contrary to the 
Americans, they have not received to date any Saudi request to 
reconsider payment arrangements. They added that should such 
proposals be submitted, they will be carefully considered. Last 
Saturday, Saudi Arabia and the United States concluded an accord 
that permits rescheduling the payment of $9.2 billion in weapons 
purchases from five U.S. corporations. The accord permits the 
payment period to be extended beyond the two years set in the 
original accord. 
  British Aerospace points out the presence of large 
differences in the method by which U.S. and British weapons 
sales to Saudi Arabia are financed. Whereas U.S. military sales 
are in cash, the arrangement in accordance with which British 
weapons costs are paid includes the delivery of 500,000 barrels 
of Saudi oil daily. This deal is more flexible and permits for 
the introduction of greater modifications, when necessary. This 
confirms the successful character of the concept of al-Yamamah 
Program as a whole. 
  British Aerospace may take care in the future of modernizing 
the Tornado's already owned by Saudi Arabia. It is likely that 
the corporation will upgrade 140 GR-1 to GR-4 [Tornado] aircraft 
belonging to the British Air Force by changing the capabilities 
of their computers and electronic equipment. The 48 aircraft 
purchased by Saudi Arabia are GR-1's. The Saudi Air Force may 
adopt the GR-4 after it is introduced to the British Air Force 
and after the aircraft proves its fitness practically. 
  The Hawk 100 and Hawk 200 have been developed especially for 
export. The Hawk 100 is a two-seat training aircraft designed to 
attack ground targets. The Hawk 200 is a single-seat light 
fighter equipped with complex systems from Westinghouse. The 
cost of a Hawk aircraft is estimated at 9-11 million pounds 
sterling. 
  It is to be noted that the old Hawks are of the Hawk 60 
series. Several Gulf states have purchased Hawk aircraft. In 
addition to Saudi Arabia, these states include Kuwait, Abu-Dhabi 
(which recently received a number of Hawk 100's), and Oman 
(which purchased four Hawk 100's and 12 Hawk 200's in 1989). It 
is hoped that Qatar will become a new client. Qatar currently 
has French-made Alfa Jet and Mirage aircraft. But it will seek 
to upgrade its air force at a later time in the 1990's. Qatar 
has firm relations with France. 
  Since 30 October 1993, i.e. when the Dubai Air Fair was 
held, 
British Aerospace has organized a major tour to market the Hawk 
100 in the Gulf, Southeast Asia, and the Far East. During this 
tour, Hawk aircraft have traveled more than 40,000 miles and 
have presented 42 exhibitions and 22 air shows for clients. All 
this has been done using no more than four liters of engine oil 
and changing the tires just twice and the brakes just once.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Umar Idris: "Saudi Arabia's Al-Fawzan Company </F>
Imports 10,000 Tonnes of Iron from Turkey; Value of 1993 Sales 
Is $237 Million"] 
  [Text] Jeddah--Khalid 'Abd-al-Latif al-Fawzan, western 
province general director for 'Abd-al-Latif and Muhammad 
al-Fawzan Company, has announced that last year the company 
recorded sales of 890 million riyals ($237 million). He also 
told AL-HAYAH that the company concluded its latest deal last 
month, importing 10,000 tonnes of iron, valued at $3 million 
[figure as published], from Turkey to meet clients' urgent 
needs. Al-Fawzan also noted that the company imported nearly 
40,000 tonnes of iron last year. It also imported 7,000 cubic 
meters of lumber, valued at nearly 6 million riyals ($1.6 
million), from Romania last month. 
  He expressed the opinion that it is unlikely that there is a 
crisis in the demand for iron in the Saudi market, saying, "The 
crisis started in 1991 and ended in 1993." 
  Khalid al-Fawzan estimated that Saudi Arabia imports nearly 
500,000 cubic meters of wood annually, with an estimated value 
of $1 billion. 
  He noted that Saudi Arabia imports white [soft] wood from 
Austria, Canada, Romania, Russia, Chile, Sweden, and Finland and 
red wood (hard wood) from Africa. It also imports plywood from 
Malaysia and Indonesia. Khalid noted that "tree age determines 
lumber prices. The average price per cubic meter is nearly $200." 
  He further noted that al-Fawzan Company imports nearly 
70,000 
cubic meters of white wood, 90,000 cubic meters of hard wood, 
and 45,000 cubic meters of plywood. He also pointed out that 
lumber imports have been growing steadily since 1986. 
  Khalid al-Fawzan further said, "Lumber prices have been 
rising constantly. In recent years these prices were half what 
they are now." He attributed the increase to the growth in 
forest cutting and decreasing world wood reserves, considering 
that the average age of trees in Russia is 180, in Canada and 
Austria 150, and in Chile 70 years. This means that the younger 
generations are the ones that will benefit from these trees. 
  Al-Fawzan pointed out that Brazil and Indonesia have reduced 
their tree cutting operations and that Malaysia is moving in the 
same direction, which means that prices will rise with the onset 
of the year 2000. He also noted that the company owns three 
factories that produce wooden platforms and luxury furniture and 
decor [wood panels] in Jeddah and that the total investment in 
these factories is 29 million riyals ($7.7 million). 
  The factories produce frames into which concrete is poured. 
The factories also cover 90 percent of the market need for 
wooden platforms in the western, southern, and northern 
provinces of Saudi Arabia. Al-Dammam factory for wooden 
platforms covers the needs of the eastern province and Riyadh. 
  The company also plans to introduce another line to produce 
annually 671,000 wood panels that meet Brazilian standards, 
which are required by the Saudi market. A similar type of decor 
panels is produced currently at the rate of 743,000 units 
annually. The company also produces 56,000 16-mm polyester units 
and 68,000 18-mm units annually. A total of 559,000 units of 
wooden platforms were produced last year. The company also 
produced 15,000 wooden boxes to meet the needs of companies that 
package their products, including al-Jafali Company, and 12,000 
wooden molds to meet the need of domestic companies that produce 
concrete blocks. 
  Al-Fawzan also said that the Red Sea Plant for the 
production 
of prefabricated homes and al-Nur Company are major clients for 
the products turned out by al-Fawzan Company. An urgent request 
by the Red Sea Plant for panels in various colors was met by 
al-Fawzan Company at the end of last year, with the request 
delivered by air.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Khamis: "Saudization of Bank </F>
Jobs Is Back in Limelight; High Salaries and Training Course Are 
Most Important Benefits; Nationals Represent 55 Percent of All 
Bank Employees"] 
  [Text] Riyadh--Sulayman al-Mandil, general director of the 
Bank of Riyadh, has said that more than 25,000 employees work in 
the Saudi banking sector, including 14,000 Saudis, who represent 
55 percent of these workers. But al-Mandil added that an 
increasing number of bank branches does not mean an increase in 
the number of workers because it is expected that modern banking 
machines, such as ATM's, sale points, and automatic services, 
will reduce labor employment. 
  In a seminar organized by the Saudi Economic Society, 
al-Mandil noted that he expects no more than a very slight 
increase in the next five years. He emphasized that there is an 
urgent demand to Saudize the remaining 12,000 jobs. But he 
expressed the belief that to serve the national economy, gradual 
replacement is the best solution because a number of the jobs 
held by non-Saudi nationals are specialized jobs. 
  Al-Mandil's statements coincide with an increasing number of 
complaints by Saudi employees and banks, considering that the 
Saudization issue has resurfaced in the forefront after a series 
of interesting accusations, some of which have been published by 
the local press. The accusations have dealt with completing 
banking Saudization and with how serious and how slow is the 
process. 
  Within the context of the competition among Saudi banks to 
develop and to envelop their activities in a more domestic 
character, most of these banks exert efforts at present to 
attract Saudi youth to work for them. Banks are vying in 
offering inducements to the youth to work for them, including 
high salaries and advanced training courses. Many banks aspire 
to surpass the Saudization plans which were drafted by the Saudi 
Monetary Agency in the early 1980's and called for attaining 
more than 50 percent Saudization. 
  The social and economic difficulties the banks encountered 
at 
that time caused the plan to be frozen. But the plan was revived 
recently in the wake of observations made by the currency and 
fiscal authorities, which created a strong motive within the 
banks, whose profits have grown recently as a result of their 
sound investment to attract Saudi and Arab capabilities and, 
consequently, as a result of their greater understanding of the 
domestic economic reality and capital tendencies. 
  A Saudi banker said that banks have become more interested 
in 
offering services than in attracting deposits whose owners do 
not wish to collect interest on them. Because it is necessary to 
provide services with a domestic character and in a fashion that 
is acceptable to the preferences of the users, banking officials 
have found that nobody is better than local youth to offer these 
services. Deposits not based on interest amount to nearly 30 
percent of investment activities. The banks then rely on their 
various banking services. 
  An employment officer at a joint Saudi bank said that a few 
years ago banks warmly welcomed whoever wished to engage in 
banking. Often, they sent a new employee to the bank branch 
where he wished to work without giving him any training. But now 
banks compare applicants and do not permit them to work until 
they complete specialized training courses in banking. 
  Strong criticism is addressed at joint banks by Saudi 
bankers, who say that these banks support their leaderships with 
foreign cadres, always relying on Indian and Pakistani 
nationals. Some officials of joint banks do not refute this 
claim, and justify it by saying that these nationals have 
extensive banking experience and have mastered English, thus 
making it easy to communicate with them. But Saudi bankers 
refute this justification and assert that these experts are no 
better than Saudi or Arab experts and that language is not a 
barrier as it is mastered by numerous local capabilities. 
  The Banking Institute of the Saudi Arab Monetary Agency 
(SAMA) is entrusted with a task which Saudi bankers demand that 
this institute perform, namely not to wait until employees are 
referred to it by banks and not to conduct courses just for its 
employees. The agency and the institute must launch an ambitious 
training program that calls for meeting Saudi banks' needs and 
requires them to appoint employees from among institute 
graduates who have been trained in the latest technologies. 
  A banker noted that the institute is content currently with 
training SAMA employees and employees referred by the banks and 
that it does not open its doors to students who wish to work in 
the banking sector. This helps banks to allege that the 
unavailability of domestic banking capabilities experienced in 
modern technological banking needs forces them to import such 
capabilities from abroad. 
  Commenting on this matter, another banker said that joint 
banks are managed by the foreign partner according to a 
management contract agreed to by the banks' boards of directors, 
and that this contract affects the banks' employment decisions. 
This banker demands that management contracts include 
Saudization percentages binding on the foreign partner so that 
the Saudization rate will become reasonable.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "King Fahd: Strategy of Saudi Aid to </F>
Islamic Peoples; Custodian of Two Holy Mosques Asserted That 
Commitment to Supporting Brothers Is Constant Principle"] 
  [Text] Jeddah--Diplomatic observers in Jeddah have said 
that King Fahd Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the two holy 
mosques, reaffirmed the importance of the principled political 
constants when he instructed that immediate aid of $100 million 
be advanced to Lebanon and that 50 million Saudi riyals be 
disbursed to secure more humanitarian aid for the Muslim people 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Prince Salman Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor 
of Riyadh Province and chairman of the Higher Council for the 
Collection of Donations for Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims, has 
decided to open a permanent council office in Sarajevo, in 
addition to an office in Zagreb, to deliver aid to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims. 
  Observers have pointed out that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
is just about the only country in the world that adheres to 
providing aid to Lebanon, whereas other countries continue to 
procrastinate in implementing their commitments to advance 
meaningful aid to Lebanese reconstruction projects. 
  Observers added that King Fahd's decision on Lebanon 
confirms 
that aid to brothers is a constant principle of the Saudi 
strategy, which adheres to King Fahd's ideas based on constants 
derived from the heart of the orthodox religion. 
  King Fahd has instructed the Saudi authorities concerned to 
disburse a sum of $100 million to the Lebanese Government in 
order to help Lebanon move forward to achieve the benevolent 
goals to which everybody aspires. 
  An official source said that these instructions come within 
the context of the interests of the custodian of the two holy 
mosques to see Lebanon move toward security and stability in 
accordance with the stipulations of the al-Ta'if accord and on 
the basis of the king's ceaseless eagerness to contribute to 
whatever is likely to aid Lebanon; to help its people overcome 
the consequences of the Lebanese war in various vital fields; 
and to enable Lebanese development agencies to perform an 
effective role in serving the Lebanese people. 
  The instructions were given after the king had received 
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri at al-Salam Palace in 
Jeddah. Upon returning to Beirut, al-Hariri thanked King Fahd 
for his ceaseless aid to Lebanon and its reconstruction. 
Al-Hariri said, "Saudi Arabia has gotten us accustomed to the 
special attention it always devotes to the conditions in 
Lebanon. In addition to the ceaseless political support for the 
national concord procession, this grant comes as a new 
expression reflecting the love and care King Fahd harbors for 
Lebanon and its people under all circumstances. The Lebanese 
people will not forget the aid the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, led 
by the custodian of the two holy mosques, has offered Lebanon 
during its ordeal, and now the kingdom is leading the 
reconstruction and development procession." 
  Within the framework of Saudi Arabia's efforts to keep pace 
with the steps to restore security and stability in Lebanon, 
informed sources expect that the Saudi Embassy in Beirut will be 
reopened shortly and that Saudia [Saudi Airways] will resume its 
flights to Lebanon. 
<H5>  To Bosnia </H5>
  Within the context of the same principles, the king himself 
has issued instructions for the disbursement of 50 million 
riyals to provide additional aid for the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Saudi Council of Ministers has expressed 
its profound regret and deep pain at the continued Serbian 
attacks and unjust actions against the unarmed Bosnian people, 
who lack all means of self-defense. The council renewed its 
appeal to the Security Council and international circles to 
"continue their efforts to put a stop to the Serbian attacks; to 
establish a cease-fire immediately; and to enable aid 
organizations to treat the wounded and save whatever can be 
saved under the poor conditions that are worsening day after 
day." 
  King Fahd instructed the authorities concerned to disburse 
50 
million riyals to secure more in-kind aid, food, and medical 
supplies and to ship them immediately to the victims and the 
sons of the Bosnia-Herzegovina people who have been evicted from 
their towns and villages, and to also transport a number of 
wounded sons of the Bosnia-Herzegovina people for treatment in 
Saudi Arabia. King Fahd also urged citizens to continue their 
customary humanitarian activities by making financial 
contributions to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina through the 
Saudi Higher Council for the Collection of Donations for the 
People of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is headed by Prince Salman 
Ibn 'Abd-al-Aziz, the governor of Riyadh Province. 
  The council's permanent office in Sarajevo, on agreement 
with 
a certain company, has secured seven trucks to ship wheat and 
flour to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In this connection, Prince Salman appealed to all citizens 
and residents and all companies and establishments to extend a 
helping hand to our afflicted brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina so 
as to console them and bolster their steadfastness in the face 
of their enemies and rescue their old men, children, and women 
from the murder, displacement, desecration of honor, and mass 
annihilation to which they are being subjected. 
<H5>  And Somalia </H5>
  Persevering in the course of helping Muslim victims of 
natural or human catastrophes anywhere, King Fahd explained in 
the latest cabinet session the mission of the Saudi force 
dispatched to this country [Somalia] to participate with the UN 
forces in facilitating the delivery of food supplies and aid to 
the besieged and the victims in all parts of Somalia and to 
cooperate with the UN forces constantly in whatever serves 
Somalia's interest. 
  King Fahd said, "The reports we are receiving confirm all 
the 
time that the Saudi soldier is liked and appreciated by 
everybody in Somalia." 
  Under the supervision of Prince Salman, the Higher Council 
for the Collection of Donations has distributed 31,200 copies of 
the Koran, translated into the Somali language, as a gift from 
the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Complex for Printing the 
Venerable Koran to Somali emigrants in Nairobi. 
  A source at the council said that this gift pleased the 
emigrants because of the desirable benefit it yields and because 
it helps Muslims morally and preserves their faith in a country 
where misguided religious and denominational movements compete 
to attract these emigrants and exploit their poverty and need in 
order to steer them away from their faith. 
  The source said that supplying Somali emigrants with the 
venerable Koran in their own language makes it easier for them 
to understand it; strengthens their adherence to their faith; 
and fortifies them against their enemies. Victimized and needy 
Somalis are helped, moreover, with various foodstuffs. The 
council is eager to make sure that these foodstuffs are of the 
highest quality, a fact that has made the emigrants view 
materials supplied by the council as foodstuffs that include all 
necessary ingredients. The council office provides material aid 
to mosque imams and supervisors of Islamic schools. Moreover, 
the council office also takes care of orphans at six centers for 
a period of six months. The cost of these centers amounted to 
1,619,880 Kenyan shillings. 
  The office distributes food supplies to needy families 
according to number of family members. A survey is made of 
families in camps, centers, and poor villages so cooperation can 
be established between the working team assigned by the council 
office in Nairobi and notables in these places, such as quarter 
imams, mayors, and teachers. In the past four months this food 
aid cost 1,370,541 Kenyan shillings. 
  The council office in Nairobi also distributed the meat of 
livestock sacrifices made on al-Adha Holiday to deserving 
people. At the end of the pilgrimage season, the government of 
custodian of the two holy mosques shipped this meat to Islamic 
countries so it could be distributed to the needy in these 
countries according to the directives of the government of 
custodian of the two holy mosques, which seeks to help the needy 
and afflicted in all parts of the world. 
<H5>  Islamic Concept </H5>
  A diplomatic source said that the monarch, government, and 
people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believe that Muslims in 
all countries are like one body and soul or like one structure 
in which each part supports the other. To embody this great 
Islamic concept, the custodian of the two holy mosques has 
instructed the kingdom's official and popular circles to exert 
the utmost efforts to aid and provide relief to their brothers 
in faith who are confronted by terrible tragic circumstances as 
a result of aggression, war, and blind domestic sedition. The 
kingdom's monarch, government, and people have risen to help the 
brothers in Afghanistan and, previously, the brothers in 
Palestine. Lately they have risen to help the brothers in 
Somalia and the brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who are being 
subjected to the most heinous forms of oppression and 
annihilation by the malicious Serb militias. 
  The source added that in view of these painful ordeals, 
catastrophes, and tragedies, which are afflicting Muslim peoples 
with their woes, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has responded to 
the call of duty, donating everything valuable and priceless and 
following in the footsteps of the custodian of the two holy 
mosques, who was the first to contribute his own money. He has 
also directed that air corridors be established so as to ship 
aid, food, medicines, and tents, plus doctors and medical 
equipment, aboard Saudi planes flying from the kingdom to the 
afflicted Islamic countries to aid their peoples, ease their 
grief, and alleviate their suffering. 
  Moreover, the kingdom's relief organizations, which are 
headed by His Royal Highness Prince Salman Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
governor of Riyadh Province, have been actively collecting 
donations from the Saudi people, who have been contributing most 
willingly and generously out of awareness of their duty toward 
their brothers in the faith. 
  Observers said that these charitable efforts and noble 
humanitarian positions emanating from the heart of Islam, which 
have been taken by King Fahd Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the 
two holy mosques, and his government and people, are the best 
proof confirming the kingdom's ceaseless eagerness to embody 
cooperation, solidarity, and unity among Muslims everywhere. 
  Observers said that this is nothing new to the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, which represents strong support for Islamic 
causes. Throughout its history the kingdom has been the 
sanctuary and strong support for its sisters, Islamic states, 
especially in times of tribulations and ordeals. This is 
dictated by the kingdom's Islamic faith and its genuine Arab 
character. 
  The observers added that the kingdom offers material and 
moral aid to Islamic states and peoples needing aid and 
assistance out of the dictates of its Islamic faith and because 
it seeks to please God, may He be praised and exalted, and to 
gain His reward. The kingdom does not offer this aid because of 
political or propaganda considerations or out of hollow, 
glittering, and misleading slogans. This is the kingdom's course 
and its constant policy toward its Muslim brothers everywhere. 
When all groups of Saudi people rise to contribute, sacrifice, 
and aid and help their Muslim brothers, they reaffirm their 
adherence to their faith, to the teachings of their religion, 
and to their genuine Arab traditions. They follow in this regard 
the footsteps of their leader, the custodian of the two holy 
mosques, who spares no effort to support Islam and Muslims and 
to embrace the Muslims' just causes at every level.

  [Text] Despite the fact that Hashim Badr-al-Din confessed, 
in his statements to the police and in court, that he struck 
al-Turabi, the final verdict was that he was innocent of the 
three charges against him, which related to general assault, 
assault with intent to cause bodily harm. Perhaps the factor 
that did the most to turn the tide of the case in the suspect's 
favor was the contradiction in witnesses' false testimony, 
costing them the case. 
  The Canadian defense attorney, Gary Barnes, focused on an 
attempt to demolish the statements of the prosecution witnesses, 
chiefly the major prosecution witness Ahmad 'Uthman Makki, a 
member of the NIF's leadership cadres, who was accompanying 
al-Turabi when the assault occurred in Ottawa Airport. The 
defense attorney succeeded in causing one of the Somali 
prosecution witnesses, who had accompanied al-Turabi (as a 
bodyguard, according to the defense attorney), to acknowledge 
that his testimony before the court and in his statements to the 
police had been false, and that another witness had dictated to 
him what to say. 
  The defense attorney also tried to cast doubt on the 
narrative of the chief prosecution witness about the way the 
incident took place. He was thus trying to prove that the 
witness had not actually seen the assault on al-Turabi, hence 
his testimony did not reflect the whole picture of the assault. 
  It appears that the defense strategy and the contradiction 
in 
witness statements, together with the fact that al-Turabi did 
not give statements to the police or the court because he did 
not recall the details of the assault, combined in the end to 
lead the jury to a verdict of not guilty on all counts for the 
defendant. 
<H5>  Selections from the Sessions </H5>
  We now present some selections from one of the sessions 
between the defendant's lawyer and the star witness, Ahmad 
'Uthman Makki, in order to convey one aspect of the atmosphere 
in the court and considerations of the case. The session began 
with the following exchange between the defense attorney, Ms. 
Morand, and the witness, Ahmad 'Uthman Makki: 
  [Morand] Mr. Makki, do I understand that the place of your 
residence, and of your family, is Sudan? 
  [Makki] I live in Sudan, but my family lives in Chicago. 
  [Morand] I understand. You are also, sir, a religious 
preacher at the present time. 
  [Makki] That is true. 
  [Morand] As I understand it, you engage in this preaching in 
Sudan and abroad, in the United States. 
  [Makki] That is true. 
  [Morand] You were a member of the Sudanese parliament--in 
what years? 
  [Makki] That is true. 
  [Morand] In what years? 
  [Makki] That was from 1986 until mid-1989. 
  [Morand] And at that time, you were also the editor in chief 
of a periodical. 
  [Makki] Correct. It is a prominent newspaper in Sudan. 
  [Morand] Yes. What was the name of that newspaper? 
  [Makki] AL-RAYAH. The Banner. (He explains its meaning in 
English.) 
  [Morand] When you got to the airport in Ottawa, what 
happened, sir? 
  [Makki] We got to the airport at 1855 (on the evening of the 
assault), or about five minutes before take-off. I was the first 
one to go into the main terminal. We were heading toward the 
escalator to go to the upper floor, to the gates. 
  When we had gone 10 steps into the building, I saw two 
Sudanese individuals, one of them a very tall man--he was the 
same person I had previously seen in front of the (Canadian) 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was shouting at us. I mean, he 
was, that he said, as I recall, some words. 
  [Morand] What were those words? 
  [Makki] He said, "Stop. Where are you going?" 
  [Morand] What language was he speaking? 
  [Makki] Arabic. 
  [Morand] Yes. And who was he addressing when he said that? 
  [Makki] He was speaking to Dr. al-Turabi. 
  [Morand] When you heard these shouts, what did you do? 
  [Makki] I expected him to attack Dr. al-Turabi, because I 
saw 
him raise his right arm, trying to hit Dr. al-Turabi. So I tried 
to prevent him by grabbing his arm. Then he hit me on my right 
arm, I mean, my right eye, smashing my glasses. Then some blood 
flowed from my eye or from my nose--that is recorded in the 
hospital records. I fell to the ground, but I stood up 
immediately in order to prevent any other attacks on Dr. 
al-Turabi. 
  [Morand] Yes? 
  [Makki] At the same time, the other person who was with us, 
Mr. Rashid (Muhammad Ibrahim Rashid--the Somali attendant) stood 
in front, I mean, beside Dr. al-Turabi. He had a baggage trolley 
to prevent (Badr-al-Din) from hitting Dr. al-Turabi, but I saw 
him (Badr-al-Din) hitting Dr. al-Turabi on the head. 
  [The Court] You saw the accused hit al-Turabi on the head? 
  [Makki] Correct. 
  [The Court] With what? 
  [Makki] The palm of his right hand. 
  [Morand] What did al-Turabi do at that moment? 
  [Makki] Oh, he fell to the ground. 
  [Morand] Yes? 
  [Makki] Many--I mean, spurts of blood flowed out of his 
mouth, from his nose, and he was sneering. 
  [Morand] He was doing what? 
  [Makki] Sneering. 
  [Morand] Sneering? 
  [Makki] Yes. 
  [Morand] Would you explain to the court what you mean by 
this 
word you used, "sneering." 
  [Makki] Yes, like this. (The witness makes a snoring sound.) 
  [Morand] Oh, you mean snoring. 
  [Makki] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
  [Morand] Thank you. 
  [Makki] Then blood came out of his mouth. Yes, it was 
flowing. 
  [Morand] What did you do after that? 
  [Makki] I covered Dr. al-Turabi, because at that moment the 
attacker had paused for a few seconds to see what Dr. al-Turabi 
was doing. I was afraid that he would advance and attack him 
again, so I covered Dr. al-Turabi myself, and after that I tried 
to get the police. 
  [Morand] Sir, it is not clear to me what you mean. When you 
say that you covered Dr. al-Turabi yourself, what did you do? 
How did you cover him? 
  [Makki] I placed myself-- 
  [Morand] Oh, you mean you placed your body... 
  [Makki] Like this. Yes, with my body. That's right. 
  [Morand] Thank you. You indicated that you called for the 
police. 
  [Makki] Yes. 
  [Morand] Dr. al-Turabi was on the floor, and you indicated 
to 
the court that he was making a snoring sound, and that you saw 
blood. What can you tell the judge about his (al-Turabi's) 
consciousness or unconsciousness? 
  [Makki] He was unconscious. He was not conscious at all. 
  [Morand] As far as you know, where is Dr. al-Turabi now? 
  [Makki] In Khartoum. 
  [Morand] When was the last time you saw him? 
  [Makki] About two weeks ago. 
  [Morand] How was his general health two weeks ago? 
  [Makki] Better than it was a year ago, but he was still 
ailing. He is still receiving some treatment. 
<H5>  Heated Battle </H5>
  When the prosecuting attorney had finished her questioning, 
the defense attorney, Gary Barnes, began his cross-examination 
of the witness, Ahmad 'Uthman Makki; this was the 
cross-examination that turned at times into a heated battle of 
words. Portions follow: 
  [Barnes] You came from Toronto (to Ottawa) with Dr. 
al-Turabi, is that so? 
  [Makki] It is. 
  [Barnes] Right. Who traveled along with you from Toronto? 
Was 
there a large group with you, or was it just the two of you? 
  [Makki] From Toronto to Ottawa? 
  [Barnes] To Ottawa, yes. 
  [Makki] Mr. Sayyid Muzaffar. We were three. 
  [Barnes] Right. Were you traveling under your own names? 
  [Makki] For myself, yes. 
  [Barnes] But Dr. al-Turabi did not travel under his real 
name. 
  [Makki] He did travel under his real name. 
  [Barnes] He traveled under his real name? 
  [Makki] Yes. His name is Hasan 'Abdallah al-Turabi. His 
father was 'Abdallah. In Sudan, we use the father's name, and 
that is why he traveled under the name Hasan 'Abdallah. 
  [Barnes] So his reservation for the flight was in that name? 
  [Makki] In the name 'Abdallah H. 
  [Barnes] Right. Did he ever use the name Loony? 
  [Makki] Loony? 
  [Barnes] Yes. 
  [Makki] Never. No. 
  [Barnes] He never used this name at all? 
  [Makki] No. 
  [Barnes] Do you know any other person to use this name? 
  [Makki] Loony? 
  [Barnes] Yes. 
  [Makki] No. Never. 
  [Barnes] You changed your flight plans. You were supposed to 
leave Ottawa at 1200. 
  [Makki] That is true. 
  [Barnes] You changed it to seven o'clock. 
  [Makki] That is true. 
  [Barnes] Only the people who were with you knew of this 
change, because it was a last-minute decision. 
  [Makki] No. That (the change in plans) may have been half an 
hour before. 
  [Barnes] Do you know who arranged the itinerary of your 
visit 
to Ottawa from Toronto? Did you arrange the flight? 
  [Makki] No, Mr. Muzaffar did that. 
  [Barnes] As far as you know, how many people knew of your 
travel plans? 
  [Makki] I have no idea. 
  [Barnes] When did you find out for the first time that you 
would come from Toronto to Ottawa with Dr. al-Turabi? 
  [Makki] Several days before our arrival in Ottawa, because I 
had some contacts with Mr. Muzaffar regarding the itinerary here 
in Chicago, I mean, in Ottawa, and also in Toronto. 
  [Barnes] There were some problems in Toronto because of 
demonstrations, isn't that so? 
  [Makki] There was no big demonstration. About five or six 
people waited in front of the hotel and chanted. So I can't say 
there was any big demonstration, but to me it means that there 
were persons who knew of our flight plans. 
  [Barnes] Had you traveled with Dr. al-Turabi prior to this? 
  [Makki] Yes, many times. 
  [Barnes] It is not unusual for there to be demonstrators in 
the places that he visits, isn't that right? 
  [Makki] That was the first time we had had that experience. 
  [Barnes] Hadn't you ever seen a demonstration prior to that 
in the places you visited with Dr. al-Turabi? 
  [Makki] Against Dr. al-Turabi? 
  [Barnes] Yes. 
  [Makki] No. Never. 
  [Barnes] No demonstration at all? 
  [Makki] Never. 
<H5>  Witness Accused of Fleeing </H5>
  Some of the long discussion between the defense attorney and 
the witness revolved around the identity and nationality of 
al-Turabi's companions, as well as their reasons for 
accompanying al-Turabi, and whether some of them were personal 
bodyguards. Then the questioning moved on to the manner in which 
the assault occurred in the airport. There came a point where 
Makki said that the accused, Hashim Badr-al-Din, tried to escape 
from the airport after the assault. The defense attorney opposed 
this story and the following discussion took place: 
  [Barnes] You say that he (Badr-al-Din) was trying to flee, 
and that they caught him? 
  [Makki] Correct. 
  [Barnes] Were there many people at that time? I mean, other 
people in the airport? 
  [Makki] Everyone was taken by surprise, I mean, by what had 
happened. 
  [Barnes] I am telling you, sir, that he (Badr-al-Din) did 
not 
try to escape at all, and that as soon as the incident took 
place, he stood where he was and stayed there, repeating 
slogans; and that at no time did he try to flee. 
  [Makki] I have no knowledge of that. 
  [Barnes] But you told us a minute ago that he tried to flee. 
  [Makki] No, I said that he tried to flee, but you said that 
he did not try to flee, and that he remained standing there. Is 
that what you mean? 
  [Barnes] I am telling you, sir, that he retreated one step 
and stood repeating slogans until the police arrived. 
  [Makki] No, sir. I will explain to you very clearly. First 
of 
all, after he struck Dr. al-Turabi, and then hit me, then he 
fought with Ibrahim (the Somali attendant), Dr. al-Turabi was 
lying on the ground while he (Badr-al-Din) stood for a few 
minutes looking at al-Turabi to make sure that his mission was 
accomplished. Dr. al-Turabi was bleeding, and I was shouting for 
the police to come and help. At that time, (Badr-al-Din) was 
convinced that Dr. al-Turabi was dead, then, as I recall, he 
tried to flee. 
  [Barnes] So, sir, if other witnesses came and said that he 
(Badr-al-Din) did not try to flee, and that he stayed put, they 
would be wrong. 
  [Makki] I said that he was trying to leave the place after 
hitting Dr. al-Turabi and hitting me. 
  [Barnes] Is it part of your job to protect Dr. al-Turabi? 
  [Makki] My job is not to protect him, but I am one of his 
aides. 
  [Barnes] Are you one of his bodyguards? 
  [Makki] No, I am not a guard and never have been. I have 
never received training to be a guard. 
  [Barnes] Did you go anywhere near the escalator (inside the 
airport) during the fight? 
  [Makki] No. Never. 
  [Barnes] You never went anywhere near the escalator? 
  [Makki] Never. I stayed near him (al-Turabi). 
  [Barnes] I am telling you, sir, that this is exactly what 
you 
did after you were hit. You fled and hid behind the escalator. 
  [Makki] No, never. I did not say I fled, but when I stood 
up, 
I mean, after--I mean, after I got up from the ground. I said 
that I tried to be a little far off from him (Badr-al-Din), to 
protect Dr. al-Turabi. But I did not ever go near the escalator, 
because the escalator was sort of far from where the incident 
took place. 
  [Barnes] So you would be surprised to hear some witnesses 
say 
that you fled behind the escalator. You would not agree with 
this, I suppose. 
  [Makki] Absolutely not. 
<H5>  Nature of the Visit </H5>
  The discussion moved on after that to other points relating 
to Dr. al-Turabi and his current occupation in government, and 
whether he enjoys wide influence in the present government. 
Makki responded by saying that this was debatable. The defense 
attorney came back to ask Makki whether he had ever seen 
demonstrations against al-Turabi, and the following exchange 
took place: 
  [Barnes] Were you with him (al-Turabi) in Britain? 
  [Makki] No. 
  [Barnes] No? 
  [Makki] No, but I was with him in the United States. 
  [Barnes] You have previously said that there were no 
demonstrations against him (al-Turabi), there was no person 
shouting against him in the United States. 
  [Makki] No, according to my recollection. But I read in one 
of the papers that there was a demonstration in Washington. In 
Sudan, some people said that they demonstrated against him, but 
you asked me about myself. 
  [Barnes] You have seen no demonstrations? 
  [Makki] No. 
  [Barnes] Do you have any official position in the 
government? 
  [Makki] No. 
  [Barnes] When was the last time you worked in it officially? 
  [Makki] I have never held government office. 
  [Barnes] Thank you. What precisely is your occupation now? 
  [Makki] I am a religious preacher. 
  [Barnes] Right. And so you travel a great deal in this work? 
  [Makki] Yes, I usually go to give lectures and attend 
conferences. 
  [Barnes] So it is your church, I mean your religious group, 
that pays. 
  [Makki] It is not a church, but an Islamic group, the 
Islamic 
Call Organization. 
  [Barnes] Call, you said? 
  [Makki] Yes, in Khartoum. 
  [Barnes] Do you know of the Muslim Brotherhood? 
  [Makki] Yes. 
  [Barnes] Are you a member (of that group)? 
  [Makki] I was a member, but there were conflicts a 
long time back. 
  [Barnes] When did you end your membership in this group? 
  [Makki] That might have been more than 15 years ago, maybe 
12. 
  [Barnes] The group you are with now, is it an international 
organization? 
  [Makki] I am not a member of any group. 
  [Barnes] Fine. You said the Islamic Call. 
  [Makki] No, it is not an international organization. Its 
headquarters is in Khartoum, but it has activities in nearly all 
African countries. 
  [Barnes] When you were a member of Parliament, what party 
did 
you belong to? 
  [Makki] The Islamic National Front. 
  [Barnes] Is it like the Muslim Brotherhood? 
  [Makki] No. 
  [Barnes] You mentioned that you had never been employed by 
the Sudanese Government. 
  [Makki] Correct. 
  [Barnes] But you know the ambassador. 
  [Makki] The ambassador where? 
  [Barnes] The Sudanese ambassador here in Ottawa. 
  [Makki] Oh, the charg&eacute; d'affaires. 
  [Barnes] Yes. 
  [Makki] Yes, I have been introduced to him. 
  [Barnes] Is he here today (in the courtroom)? 
  [Makki] Yes. 
  [Barnes] And you have doubtless discussed this case with 
him. 
  [Makki] No. 
  [Barnes] When you come to Ottawa you stay with him. 
  [Makki] Yes, I usually do. 
  [Barnes] Why did you not contact him when you came here on 
25 
May? 
  [Makki] Because we had a meeting with the minister of 
foreign 
affairs, and he had nothing to do with this meeting, because we 
were not on an official visit. 
  [Barnes] But you came here in order to speak about the 
Canadian Government's policy on Sudan. 
  [Makki] The basic reason we came here was to open a dialogue 
between our Islam, between our Islamic movement in general. We 
did not come here to speak on behalf of the Sudanese Government 
or Canadian-Sudanese relations. That is not our business. 
  [Barnes] But it was discussed during the meeting. They 
discussed civil rights abuses in Sudan with you. 
  [Makki] They talked about Sudan, Algeria, Afghanistan, and 
Lebanon, about the Islamic world in general. 
  [Barnes] Is that because Dr. al-Turabi is not only a 
representative of Sudan, but also of the Islamic movement, which 
is a global organization? It is not a matter relating to a 
single country. 
  [Makki] I cannot say that he is a member of a specific 
movement. He is a thinker and a prominent figure. 
<H5>  Funding the Trip </H5>
  [Barnes] Someone must have been paying your expenses, to 
make 
it possible for you to travel and hold meetings with the 
government and so on. Someone must have purchased the tickets. 
Who paid these costs? 
  [Makki] A friend of ours. 
  [Barnes] Only a friend who suddenly appeared to cover 
everything? 
  [Makki] Correct. 
  [Barnes] The source of the funds was not an organization or 
anything similar? 
  [Makki] No. 
  [Barnes] The government did not pay any part of the costs? 
  [Makki] Absolutely not. 
  [Barnes] When you decided to come to Ottawa, why did you not 
contact Sudanese individuals to coordinate between you and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs? 
  [Makki] Here in Ottawa? Because I met people. I met him (the 
Sudanese charg&eacute; d'affairs) when we were university 
students. 
He knows me. Then I contacted him after the incident, and was 
introduced to him. It is common for Sudanese to go and stay as 
guests with a Sudanese official, even though there may be no 
common denominator linking them to the government. It is an 
extremely social practice. 
  [Barnes] So the charg&eacute; d'affaires is someone you've 
known 
since university days. 
  [Makki] I didn't know him well. I mean that it was not 
really 
a friendship. But I was president of the Union of Students at 
the time, and he knew me. I mean that a lot of students knew me. 
  [Barnes] But when you came to Canada with Dr. al-Turabi you 
did not contact him even though he was a person... 
  [Makki] No, no, I contacted him when I was in Toronto. I 
mean, we had a telephone conversation when I was in New York, 
only as a friend. Perhaps because he was very interested in Dr. 
al-Turabi's visit, because he (al-Turabi) was deputy prime 
minister or something like that. So he was interested in his 
safety, and for that reason I phoned him and we talked. 
  [Barnes] You mentioned that you do not work in the 
government 
or anything like that, and that you avoided government contacts 
and became a religious preacher. Is that correct? This is your 
occupation now, and your work. I mean, your working as a 
religious preacher. 
  [Makki] Yes. But I have not been a member of the government, 
and did not leave government work prior to becoming a preacher. 
  [Barnes] Are you still a member of the Islamic National 
Front 
Party? 
  [Makki] No. It was dissolved (banned), and I did not... 
  [Barnes] It does not exist at all? 
  [Makki] No. 
  [Barnes] When did it cease to exist? 
  [Makki] 1989. 
  [Barnes] Did you join any other party after that? 
  [Makki] No. 
  [Barnes] Thank you, sir. I have no further questions.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques de Barrin: "Tunisia Tetanized"--first </F>
paragraph is LE MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] The presidential and legislative elections should 
not appreciably change political life, paralyzed as it is by the 
Islamist threat. 
  On Sunday, 20 March, when they go to the polls, electors 
will 
vote by color--red, green, blue, gold, etc. The ballot papers 
are in the colors of the seven political parties whose 
candidates are running for the Chamber of Deputies. On the other 
hand, a plebiscite-type vote should give Zine El Abidine Ben 
Ali, 57, another five-year presidential mandate. On 2 April 1989 
already, he had received 99.27 percent of the votes. 
  Placed under the sign of "transparency," even "pluralism," 
this dual election is unlikely to appreciably alter the way 
things stand, considering that political life is actually 
deadlocked in spite of an election code reform that might lead 
us to believe the contrary. No single-color Parliament any more, 
as used to be the case since independence, in 1956. Nowadays, it 
would not look good. 
  Triumph without peril brings no glory. The six formations of 
the legal opposition will share 19 seats in proportion to the 
votes they will get nationwide. Barring a coup de theatre, the 
Democratic Constitutional Rally (RCD), the all-powerful 
government party, is assured of making a clean sweep of the 144 
seats distributed in 25 electoral districts, thanks to the 
majority list system. That is the best you can expect from a 
dominating party that Hamed Karoui, the prime minister, recently 
judged to be "the one best qualified to organize the masses," 
the one in the best position to "manage the change" announced by 
Mr. Ben Ali on 7 November 1987, when he dismissed Habib 
Bourguiba from the government "for reason of senility." In an 
understatement, the local weekly REALITES confessed early in 
March that the RCD "is not yet quite the formation that Tunisia 
needs for a successful transition to democracy." 
<H5>  Setback for Liberties </H5>
  Even though it has begun to recruit younger members into its 
leadership, the RCD does have to bear the very heavy legacy of 
the former single party, the Destourian Socialist Party (PSD). 
It is harder to change mentalities than to replace men. In many 
regions, leaders of this party-state, of which Mr. Ben Ali is 
still the chairman, "are relentlessly giving a hard time" to 
opposition parties, REALITES noted. 
  The past is one thing; today's reality is another thing. 
Paralyzed by the chaos that prevails in Algeria, on the other 
side of their country's borders, Mr. Ben Ali and his friends are 
not keen on political openness, as they are convinced that the 
Islamists of the underground al-Nahdah movement, "preachers of 
sedition and terrorism," would know how to take advantage of it. 
Certainly, Tunisia's antifundamentalist housecleaning was 
done--with a master's hand, if we may put it that way. But the 
government team, always watchful, still uses the "threat from 
outside" as a pretext to disregard the most elementary 
humanitarian and democratic principles. 
  Considering that, according to the RCD political bureau, Mr. 
Ben Ali "is the only man fit to lead the nation's triumphant 
march to prosperity and invulnerability," it was inconceivable 
that anyone else should play opposite him. The former president 
of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH), the fiery Moncef 
Marzouki, could therefore not challenge him, not even as a beau 
geste. All were mobilized in favor of the "man of change"; even 
local journalists, so ill-treated by the government, were forced 
to support the sole candidate "because they know that he is 
sowing the good seed." 
  That political balancing act was far more strange on the 
part 
of the legal opposition that was expected to campaign 
simultaneously for the RCD leader, sole candidate to the highest 
office, and against candidates of that same RCD running for the 
Chamber of Deputies. Mohamed Moada, president of the Movement of 
Socialist Democrats (MDS), assured Mr. Ben Ali of the "unfailing 
confidence" of his militants; and Mohamed Harmel, general 
secretary of the former Communist Party, assured him of the 
"unanimous support" of his comrades. 
<H5>  Bread and Security </H5>
  The existence of seven legally recognized parties, more than 
5,000 associations, and some 120 publications does not in any 
way alter the fact that, behind this democratic decor, the power 
is more than ever concentrated in the hands of one man, 
surrounded by a handful of advisers, even courtiers. Everything 
starts at the Carthage Palace, and everything comes back to it. 
Nothing is decided or said without his approval. As a result, 
any "strategy of dialogue" is reduced to its simplest terms. 
  Many have denounced this autocratic deviation. Last year, 
over 200 Tunisian intellectuals and the General Union of 
Tunisian Students (UGET) deplored "the appreciable setback 
inflicted on liberties" under the pretext of fighting 
fundamentalism. In January, Amnesty International mentioned "the 
chasm" between what the government says and what it does, citing 
"serious and systematic human rights violations." These 
accusations, the government said, were "false and slanderous 
allegations." 
  More relevant is the struggle against the "green peril" 
engaged by Mr. Ben Ali and his friends outside the political 
field proper. For his part, Mohamed Charfi, the minister of 
education and sciences, organizes it masterfully. "It is not 
social conditions, poverty, destitution that are at the origin 
of fundamentalist movements," he likes to say. "Fundamentalism 
is generated by the school." 
  Therefore, a vast reform of the school system was started, 
involving a retraining of the teaching body and a revision of 
programs and textbooks. As a result, young Tunisians are again 
studying the author of Candide. "A student who has read 
Voltaire," Mr. Charfi pointed out, "will never be an 
Islamist..." 
  Habib Bourguiba already had seriously engaged his country on 
the road to modernity. The first birth-control measures date 
back to 1961; the population growth rate thus dropped to below 2 
percent per year. Thanks to the personal status code that came 
into force in 1956, Tunisia now finds itself several tens of 
years ahead of most Arab states as far as polygamy, repudiation, 
conjugal consent, etc., are concerned. "In our country," a 
female Tunis lawyer noted, "the law was ahead of mentality 
changes." 
  "The irrevocable choice of free enterprise" is also 
beginning 
to bear fruit. Efforts to achieve "Chinese-like growth"--5 
percent per year on the average from 1987 to 1992--caused the 
emergence of a middle class, although it was also accompanied by 
a policy aimed at reducing social inequalities, which are far 
less glaring than at the other end of the Maghreb, in Morocco, a 
country always so quick to set itself as an example. 
  Bread and security. Does that mean that everything is for 
the 
best in the best of all possible Tunisian worlds; that, as Mr. 
Ben Ali claims, this country is "a developed country in every 
respect"? Not so fast: paradoxically, Islamism also feeds on 
democratic inadequacies, as can be seen in Algeria, where the 
FLN [National Liberation Front] so thoroughly paved the way for 
the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front].

<F P=106> [Article by Khedija Chaloul: "General State Budget, 1994"; </F>
first 17 paragraphs are CONJONCTURE introduction; all figures as 
published] 
  [Text] The 1994 General State Budget was adopted as 
Finance Law No. 93-125 dated 27 December 1993. It reflects a 
continuation of the choices and guidelines set forth in the 
Eighth Economic and Social Development Plan. 
  The reforms initiated in the fields of taxation, 
deregulated trade, and incentives for private investment are 
being continued. 
  While the 1994 General State Budget reflects a calm 
climate characterized by the positive results recorded over the 
preceding two years in terms of growth, employment, restraint of 
price developments, and preservation of the internal financial 
equilibriums, it nevertheless faces a certain amount of pressure 
due to the foreign debt and the need to prevent runaway price 
increases as a result of the wage increases granted in 1993. 
  It is in that optimistic context that the total volume 
of the 1994 General State Budget was set at 5.515 billion 
dinars[D] compared to D4.95 billion in 1993, an 11.4-percent 
increase. 
  Tax revenues continue to constitute the main source of 
funds for the state budget. They are expected to total D3.5 
billion compared to D3.08 billion in 1993, a 13.6-percent 
increase. 
  Nontax revenues are estimated at D702 million, thus 
remaining more or less at their 1993 level of D700 million. 
  Borrowing will provide D1.203 billion, of which 72 
percent will come from domestic loans. 
  Expenditures under Title I (state operating 
expenditures) are set at D3.422 billion, an increase of 10 
percent over 1993. 
  Operating expenditures related to payroll and current 
management expense in government departments are set at D2.116 
billion, or 62 percent of total current expenditures. That 
increase of 11.6 percent over 1993 is due in particular to pay 
raises. 
  Expenditures under Title II are set at D2.093 billion, 
or about 14 percent more than capital expenditures in 1993. 
  Those expenditures are divided into direct investments 
(D635 million), financial operations (D415 million), and 
reimbursement of debt principal (D1.043 billion, including D507 
million for the reimbursement of domestic debt). 
  Taking the above data into account, the net budget 
deficit is estimated at D320 million, compared to D357 million 
in 1993 and D389.8 million in 1992. 
  The following should also be mentioned: 
  1. The revenues and expenditures of government 
enterprises whose budgets are attached to the General State 
Budget as a suspense item are set at D334.961 million, compared 
to D305.029 million in 1993, a 9.8-percent increase. 
  2. The revenues and expenditures of government 
enterprises whose budgets are attached to the annexed budget as 
a suspense item are set at D1.875 million, compared to D1.793 
million in 1993. 
  3. Revenues in the annexed budget are set at D273 
million for 1994, an increase of 10 percent over 1993 (D248 
million) despite elimination of the item relative to television 
broadcasting revenues. 
  4. Revenues and expenditures in connection with special 
Treasury funds are set at D643 million, an increase of 5.2 
percent over 1993 (D611 million).

<H5>  Prime Minister's Office </H5>
  The amounts allocated to the prime minister's office itself 
total D14.456 million, or 9 percent more than the 1993 credits.

percent. 
  3. Indirect intervention in the social and cultural area: 
+4.1 percent.

for purchasing TV equipment to cover the Africa Cup of Nations. 
  Disregarding that one-time expenditure, the investment

  [Text] Since the time that the idea of planning took hold 
among the nation's officials (in the year 1316 [21 March 1937-20 
March 1938]) and government and private sector activity began to 
occur within the framework of organized planning, the government 
has always had the greatest share in economic activity. On this 
basis, one can compare the nation's economy to a government 
economy. 
  One of the main differences between a government economy and 
a free economy is that in a government economy price increases 
are made by the government, while in a free economy the 
fluctuations of supply and demand determine price changes. It is 
for this reason, and perhaps others, that most economists 
believe that government involvement in an economy will have a 
positive result when the government's share in all production is 
more than 75 percent or less than 30 percent. Between 30 percent 
and 75 percent, the government's share in total production is 
not that desirable. 
  Last week the Council of Ministers was unable to pass Note 
25, and in reality the Majles opposed price increases for some 
government goods, and the people were very happy with this 
Majles measure. However, every day we see that the prices of 
goods and services are increasing without the Majles taking the 
government to task for it. As examples, one can mention the 
increased prices for Vahed Company bus tickets, meat, chicken, 
milk, residential rentals and hundreds of other items. However, 
because some of these things are not marketed directly by the 
government, there is no need for the Majles to approve increases 
in their prices. 
  On the other hand the Economic Council, which was once 
called 
the Price Setting Council, considers the setting the prices of 
goods and services to be one of its responsibilities, because in 
Iran's government economy leaving prices all at once to market 
supply and demand is impossible. This may be due to the fact 
that one of the basic bottlenecks in Iran's economy is the 
marketing of goods. 
  When supply cannot respond to increased demand, in a free 
economy the result is definitely an increase in price. 
Unfortunately, however, the current situation in the nation's 
economy is neither fish nor fowl. The government does not have 
the least involvement in price fluctuations and on the other 
hand some of the things the government does cause price 
increases. 
  For example, the increase in the price of Vahed bus tickets 
led to increases in other transportation fares. Of course, since 
the government has decided to leave it to the market to set 
prices and to refrain from unnecessary intervention, the public 
was forced to accept price increases in transportation services. 
Unfortunately, however, the planners of such an economy (neither 
government nor private) did not take all the aspects into 
account. They must not [as published] keep the following points 
in mind at all times: 
  1. If the economy is to turn a greater role over to the 
private sector, then the problem of supply in the economy must 
first be solved. Otherwise, the pricing mechanism will not be 
efficient. 
  2. An economy and people who have gotten used to government 
pricing over a period of many years cannot support the lack of 
government involvement, especially in the domestic commercial 
sector. Moreover, if the government exercises effective control 
over prices and distribution procedures, it will be more 
beneficial to society and the government. It must be said that 
government pricing is not at all in conflict with the policies 
of privatization. 
  3. Again, because of limited supply, proposed price 
increases 
for government goods will have no effect other than to cause a 
series of price increases for other goods. 
  In short, under current circumstances, neither the 
government 
nor the private sector is able to manage Iran's economy. Before 
some kind of damage is done to the various sectors, the 
respected Council of Ministers must go into action before 
certain conditions reduce its involvement, while at the same 
time, as it sets the prices for government goods and services it 
must also keep in mind the effects this will have on other goods.

  [Text] Hamadan, JAHAN-E ESLAM Correspondent -- In the 
Hamadan Province there are no government units of any kind or 
heavy industry factories, and only 406 workplace units are 
operating under the supervision of this province's office of 
heavy industries. 
  Engineer Barqe'i, general manager of Hamadan Province's 
Office of Industries, speaking at an ideological meeting of 
province managers, announced the above. He added: Since the time 
of the establishment of the Ministry of Heavy Industries in the 
year 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] to the year 1369 [21 
March 1990-20 March 1991], the Office of Heavy Industries in the 
province of Hamadan has operated independently. With only five 
employees, this office supervises the work of 406 foundries, 
mills, and builders of agricultural implements and other similar 
goods. 
  He emphasized the need for the government to create heavy 
industry units in the Hamadan Province. He said that one of the 
most important reasons for the increase in the unemployment rate 
in this province is the lack of heavy industries in Hamadan. 
  Our correspondent reports that with the continuation of this 
meeting, which was attended by Governor-General Khorram, the 
deputy governors-general and all the province's executive 
directors, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Musavi, the 
vice-regent's representative in the province and the Friday imam 
of Hamadan, gave a speech in which he discussed God's days, and 
said the 10 Days of Dawn celebrating the triumph of the Islamic 
revolution of Iran is one of the valuable divine gifts to the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. He said it is important to preserve 
this blessing and that this is the duty of each and every person 
in society. 
  As for Hamadan Province, he discussed the arrival of the 
blessed month of Ramadan and emphasized purity, cleanliness, and 
preparedness to enter this blessed month. He said the secret of 
the human being's success and triumph is the presence of 
spirituality and the clergy in society. He added: The violence, 
the commotion and the killing and slaughter in the Western world 
arises from the lack of spirituality in those societies.

  [Text] Tehran, (IRNA) -- The executive director of the 
National Tea Organization said: Through the use of an irrigation 
system, the full utilization of the area under cultivation and 
other parameters, the production of dried tea this year reached 
70,000 tons, which is 15,000 tons more than last year. 
  Yusef Azadmanesh added: This increased production resulted 
in 
a savings of $50 million in foreign exchange for tea imports. 
  Yusef Azadmanesh gave an interview to IRNA on Sunday. He 
added: Last year 56,000 tons of dried tea was produced, while 
another 30,000 tons was purchased from India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, 
Bangladesh, and Indonesia. 
  Concerning tea imports, the executive director of the 
National Tea Organization said: Excessive imports of tea in 
recent years by peddlers and people living near the borders and 
the failure to control it have brought disruption and disorder 
to the market, and this damages production. 
  He also said: Pricing limitations imposed by the Consumer 
and 
Producer Protection Organization and also the packaging of tea 
has enabled domestic tea to compete in terms of quality and 
packaging with foreign products. It is hoped that with 
comprehensive government support for farmers, this product will 
find its rightful place. 
  Azadmanesh said the main reasons for the low quality of 
domestic tea in previous years were the failure to make proper 
use of modern machinery and harvesting substandard leaves from 
the tea bushes, and he said this trend has recently been 
improved. 
  The executive director of the National Tea Organization 
discussed the payment of government subsidies. He said: 
Currently the finished price of a kilogram of dry tea is about 
3,000 rials[R], while each kilogram of tea is marketed at R1,500 
to R2,700. 
  According to this official, in the Second Five-Year Economic 
Plan, the harvesting of more crops per surface unit will 
continue, with the creation of rainfall irrigation networks, and 
the area under cultivation will be expanded.

  [Text] On Monday the deputy minister of commerce said: The 
value of our nation's official and unofficial exports last year 
was about $6 billion, of which only $4 billion was registered 
with customs. 
  Dr. Hoseyn Noqrehkar-Shirazi, who was speaking at the 
opening 
ceremonies for the Razdar Dried Fruit Packaging Industries 
Factory, added: Our unofficial exporting was done by people 
living near the borders, itinerant peddlers and travelers. 
  He noted that in the export of goods one must not look at 
markets as one-time consumption markets. He said: We now have a 
400-million-person regional market, and in this regard we must 
fulfill our own mission. 
  Noqrehkar-Shirazi added: The Ministry of Commerce has given 
special attention to the task of educating exporters, in order 
to facilitate the work of foreign trade. 
  He said: Another of this ministry's responsibilities is 
giving the work of the people to the people themselves, and in 
this regard the Ministry of Commerce does not consider itself to 
be acting on behalf of the people, and at the same time we are 
determined to solve the problems of production. 
  The deputy minister of commerce explained: With the measures 
that have been taken, after 30 years the laws of commerce have 
been changed to benefit foreign trade, and in this regard we 
have no choice but to tie the fate of imports to that of exports. 
  He added: Our slogan is imports against exports, and this 
means increasing production, employment, per-capita income and 
exports. 
  According to Noqrehkar-Shirazi, to increase nonoil exports, 
Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping will give a special discount 
for export goods so our goods will be able to compete with goods 
from other countries. On the other hand, emphasis is given to 
reforming laws and regulations and also to forming chambers of 
commerce. 
  Concerning Iran's membership in GATT, he said: Iran is now 
an 
observer in GATT. Under current conditions GATT membership is 
not in Iran's interest. 
  This official explained: To make a complete and 
comprehensive 
study of GATT membership for Iran with consideration for all the 
areas, the Ministry of Commerce has formed a committee composed 
of several ministries. 
  At this meeting, 'Ali Reza Khatib, executive director of the 
Bank of Commerce, also gave a speech. He said: This bank is 
equipping itself to deal with problems and expedite the affairs 
of exporters. 
  He also said: As of next year, if the banking system agrees, 
the allocation of credits for exports will increase from 6 
percent to 10 percent. 
  On the other hand, a plan is being studied on the basis of 
which the banking facilities rate for exporters will be reduced. 
  Dr. Kakavand, executive director of the Export Development 
Bank, also said: This bank was established in the year 1371 [21 
March 1992-20 March 1993] to facilitate and guarantee exports. 
  He added: Another of the Export Development Bank's 
responsibilities is to provide export credits to exporters and 
buyers of Iranian goods. 
  'Alavi, deputy director of the Export Bank, said: With the 
approval of the Money and Credit Council, this bank paid the 
entire six percent of its export credits this year to applicants. 
  He explained: The problem of some industrial owners has 
nothing to do with the banking system, and the problem will be 
solved with the formation of an Export Fund.

  [Text] If pest control is not performed properly, damage 
caused to the wheat crop may be equivalent to a 1.5-million-ton 
loss--equivalent to a shortage of bread to 5 million people per 
year. 
  The head of the Organization of Plant Protection, Dr. Ahmad 
Rasipur, in a conversation with a correspondent of IRNA, said: 
With the use of government credits, during the current 
agricultural year 2 million hectares[ha] of land were treated 
against aphids, locusts, field mice, potato beetles, and other 
crop pests. 
  Dr. Ahmad Rasipur explained that untimely pest control will 
cause the loss of millions of tons of crops, worth billions of 
rials economically, which will in the long run bring about more 
dependency to the country. 
  He added: During the current agricultural year, 260,000 ha 
of 
farm land have been treated against locusts, 500,000 ha against 
field mice, 893,000 ha against aphids, 40,000 ha against 
Colorado potato beetles, and against other pests. 
  According to him, during the current year, about 1 million 
ha 
of farm land have been treated against grain weeds. This 
success, which is a part of the expansion of the pivotal plan 
for production of wheat in the country, is indebted to the 
Organization of Plant Protection. 
  Referring to the conference on locusts in the eastern region 
of southwest Asia to be held in the current month--on 5 February 
1994 in Tehran, he said: heads of organizations of plant 
protection from Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and Iran, with the 
U.N. Organization of Food and Agriculture, will participate in 
the conference. 
  Rasipur added: Currently our country is in a state of 
readiness to combat locusts in the province of Sistan va 
Baluchestan. With our specialized human force, and the use of 
pesticide and other facilities, we will launch our campaign 
against locusts whenever necessary.

  [Text] Fars Province has gained first place in wheat 
production for the last six years. Fars Province farmers, who 
have sold to the government a surplus of 815,000 tons of wheat, 
have achieved first place in the production of this strategic 
crop for the sixth consecutive year. 
  According to an ABRAR correspondent from Shiraz, the 
director-general of the Fars Rural Cooperative, Malekzadeh, on 
the occasion of the ending of the season of buying wheat in the 
province, told journalists: For the purpose of carrying out the 
plan of mechanized farming of wheat during the current 
agricultural year, 740 mechanized service units of this 
organization, with 400 tractors, 36 tillers, 16 combined units, 
and 1,174 tankers with a capacity of 2 million liters of oil are 
ready to offer their services to the farmers who are members of 
the rural cooperative companies in Fars Province. He added that 
during the last agricultural year, 445 tons of figs, 600 tons of 
rice, and 67 tons of beans, which were produced by farmers in 
the area, were sold in several parts of the province. For a 
further protection of this industrious class, plans for 
producing and marketing the crops -- such as shipping and 
exporting, creating substitute industries and establishing a 
system of information distribution on farming and production -- 
are anticipated to be carried out.

  [Text] Unfortunately, a large number of engineers have 
gravitated to Tehran, and it is for this reason that we are 
faced with a shortage of engineers in the provinces. With the 
creation of the Civil Engineering Regulatory Organization, the 
distribution of [the engineering] workforce throughout the 
country will become equitable. 
  An ABRAR correspondent reports that, yesterday, Engineer 
Seyyed Reza Hashemi, deputy minister of Urban Development and 
Architecture Affairs of the Ministry of Housing, in an interview 
with journalists, said that the second elections of the Civil 
Engineering Regulatory Organization will be held simultaneously 
in 25 provinces. 
  He added: Throughout the country there are 25,000 engineers 
in different fields, at least 50 percent of whom are in Tehran 
and the rest of them are in rural areas. Hashemi also said that 
with the completion of these elections, which will be held 
simultaneously during the month of Esfand [20 February-20 
March], an organization and a management council to handle 
engineering affairs will be established in each province. 
  He added: The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development 
enacted national construction regulations five years ago, and 
these regulations have been arranged in 20 chapters, seven of 
which have been approved by the cabinet council. Of course, the 
government is not able to be both legislator and enforcer. For 
this reason, from now on, these provincial organizations will 
inspect and investigate violations of construction regulations. 
  In response to ABRAR's question of whether the Civil 
Engineering Regulatory Organization is considered a branch of 
the Ministry of Housing or if it will be independent, Eng. 
Hashemi said that the government and the Ministry of Housing 
must support such organizations and supervise their work, but he 
said that on the whole this organization will act independently. 
  Our correspondent asked: If it is considered independent, 
then why does the Ministry of Housing interfere directly in its 
elections? 
  The deputy minister of housing answered: We [the Ministry of 
Housing] will hold the first elections, but future elections 
will be their own responsibility. 
  During this same interview, Musa Firuzi, the public 
relations 
director of the Ministry of Housing, said: the Ministry of 
Housing, with an allocation of 150 billion rials, has undertaken 
48 university projects that will cover an infrastructure of 
400,000 square meters, with a capacity of 50,000 students--10 
projects of which will be ready for use during the 10 Days of 
Dawn. 
  He added: During the same time, 92 development projects, 
which will include rehabilitation and physiotherapy centers, and 
security stations, 83 housing units and 175 classrooms, will be 
ready for use. 
  In conclusion, Firuzi said: 50,000 lots are also being 
prepared, which after completion will be delivered to those who 
had applied for them.

which can be installed on tractors, also includes the 
manufacturing technology of the machinery. 
  Officials representing Tabriz Industrial Machinery Company 
and those representing the Libyan Tractor Company agreed in 
Tripoli early this month that Libya will build 10 percent of the 
technology during the first stage and 65 percent of it during 
the next three years. 
  He added that last year 100 hydraulic lifts from the 
previous 
models of the company were also shipped to Libya for $200,000.

  [Text] The deputy minister of roads and transportation for 
road maintenance and coordination said: This year 24 billion 
rials[R] from national and provincial credits was spent to 
procure and install safety equipment on the nation's roads. 
  Engineer Mohammad Hoseyn Hava'i added: This money was spent 
to procure and install guard rails, hand rails, sodium steam 
lamps in tunnels; to buy machinery to paint lines; and also to 
create concrete safety walls and sound barriers in residential 
and industrial areas along the nation's highways. 
  Speaking at opening ceremony and putting into operation the 
Noshahr Asphalt Plant, he said: This year R7.2 billion in 
credits was also spent to repair the large bridges along the 
nation's roads. 
  He added: In the last two years the Ministry of Roads and 
Transportation, with the goal of relying on domestic resources 
and cutting foreign exchange costs, has set out with the help of 
the private sector to produce machines to paint lines, spread 
tar and spread sand, snow plows and blinking lights.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Hayane: "The Former FIS (Islamic Salvation </F>
Front) in Germany: Close to 200 Militants"--first paragraph is 
EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Germany certainly represents a special case in 
the geostrategic map of the international fundamentalist 
movement, especially where its getting established in the 
western world is concerned. 
  All Islamist organizations in the world have a pied-a-terre 
in the Federal Republic of Germany. In fact, this country has 
long been a favored meeting ground for these organizations, to 
hold their conventions, seminars, and conferences. Due to their 
very "official" nature, these activities are widely tolerated by 
German authorities. 
  Taking advantage of laws that are extremely tolerant of 
political and parapolitical activities, supported by foreigners 
on German soil, the foreign community in Germany enjoys the 
broadest possible freedom of association and action in the 
entire western hemisphere. 
<H5>  Black-Market Traffickers or Illegal Aliens </H5>
  This situation enabled a political party--in this case the 
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), installed with its facilities and 
its leadership--to operate quite legally, something that would 
be quite unthinkable in France or in the United States. 
  Actually, these countries will admit only nonpolitical 
foreign associations. It was only when the PKK officially 
claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks perpetrated 
recently against Turkish diplomatic and commercial 
representatives (killing several German citizens in the process) 
that the Bonn government decided to suspend its activities. 
  But that is not the most important. Next to the regular 
activities of Islamist movements, this peculiarity of German law 
has given rise to far more dangerous activities on the part of 
some small groups that identify with the fundamentalist movement. 
  [passage omitted] extremist and radical [trends] of Islam 
are 
represented in Germany. Some maintain veritable rear bases 
there, others sometimes mere bridgeheads. 
  Turkish and Iranian extra-Islamist ties in Germany--which 
remains one of the main destinations of the ayatollahs' agents 
in Europe--are also very strong within the Turkish community, by 
far the most imposing and one of the oldest in the country; 
numerous and very-well-organized fundamentalist networks were 
created already a long time ago. 
  As a rule, they are the ones who provide financial and 
material support to their Algerian "brothers," members of the 
former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], who reach Germany through 
France or Italy. 
  Since the state of emergency was declared in Algeria in 
February 1992, close to 9,000 Algerians are said to have applied 
for "political asylum" with German authorities. Some are genuine 
militants of Abassi's party; most of the others are just young 
black-market traffickers or illegal aliens taking advantage of 
the Bonn government's generosity toward militants of the 
Islamist party to try and settle in the country. Many succeed 
with various degrees of luck, with the complicity of some very 
lenient officials. 
  Actually, Germany is said to number now close to 200 
Algerian 
Islamist fundamentalists who are genuine activists, and 
therefore dangerous. As these militants of the banned FIS settle 
and travel, they seem to favor the area extending from 
Alsace-Lorraine (France) to Belgium and Germany. They settle, 
among other places, in the towns of Neunled, Kaiserlautern, 
Stuttgart, and Mannheim. 
  Rabah Kebir, who was just forbidden by German authorities to 
engage in any subversive political activities or statements 
against Algeria, lives in Soest, near Dortmund. There, he was 
allowed full latitude to engage in subversive activities until 
he was called to order.

"Demonstrations Against Terrorism Increase Throughout the 
Country; Marches Under Rain and Snow"--first paragraph is ALGER 
REPUBLICAIN introduction] 
  [Text] In such cases, in spite of what some media would 
have us believe, stereotyped political language becomes 
irrelevant. Similar events keep occurring again and again in 
inland towns. The phenomenon is turning into a vast, broad, 
irresistible mass movement. Fearful and enraged, our fellow 
citizens took to the streets to denounce terrorism and express 
their support to the forces engaged in a merciless fight to 
contain and eradicate it. 
  How shall we interpret the demonstrations that took place at 
Sidi-Aich, Biskra, Laghouat, Tizi-Ouzou, Bejaia, Tamanrasset, 
Babar, and Souk-Ahras? Or those of yesterday at Ouargla, Setif, 
Touggourt, and Bordj-Bou-Arreridj? Or those that are announced 
for this weekend? Rallies or demonstrations against terrorism 
and in support of a government determined to eradicate it and 
restore law and order to Algeria, bled white, on its knees, and 
undergoing an economic perfusion. The people increasingly 
understand what situation the country is in, and they are 
getting better at discerning what games are being played. 
Somehow drugged, abused, and robbed, the people understand more 
clearly the true problems faced by our society. Believing in 
integrity, they expected to be helped by angels coming down from 
heaven. All they saw was death, grief, destruction, and 
abominable exclusions. Actually, they were the terrorized 
witnesses of the rise of fascism. This slow and painful 
realization actually amounted to the political education of an 
entire people. Remember that in 1954 there were only a handful 
of men determined to take up arms and liberate the country. 
  How can we fight against a massively armed army, NATO, air 
and naval forces, with mere peashooters, people would ask then. 
Yet, against this armada, there was the concept of justice: 
Algeria must be freed from the settlers that oppressed it. It 
was hard. Very hard. Our revolutionary experience may well have 
been unique. This is what we risked losing with the Afghan runts. 
  What is the ideal of the fundamentalists and their mafia 
supporters? Perhaps it was this aspect that determined the 
choices of Algeria, the green multinational, and its masters. It 
was an entire people, trusting and naive, that was almost led to 
the slaughterhouse or in the arena where dwarfs assemble. 
  It was like a breath of fresh air when we learned, 
yesterday, 
that thousands of Algerians had marched under the snow at 
Bordj-Bou-Arreridj. This courageous march is quite a symbol. 
Does it mean that something more profound is on the move? 
  Patriots, democrats, and republicans will have to pay 
attention to these demonstrations. 
<H5>  At Bordj-Bou-Arreridj </H5>
  Despite the cold and the snow, a march against terrorism and 
in support of President Zeroual took place on Wednesday at 1000, 
at Bordj-Bou-Arreridj. 
  Initiated at the governorate's second conference of the UNJA 
[National Union of Algerian Youth] High-School section, held on 
Monday, 7 February, at the Belgharbi junior high school, this 
demonstration was organized by Bordj civil society. They thus 
expressed their support for law and order and for the country's 
new government. 
  What is remarkable, too, was their boldness in displaying 
banners bearing the slogans: "No to terrorism!" In Bordj, that 
is something new. 
  Thousands of demonstrators met near the stadium and marched 
all the way to the town hall. From the balcony of the building, 
overlooking Place de la Liberte, a youth read a motion 
denouncing the terrorists' barbarity and supporting the new 
president. 
  The bad weather that prevailed in the last two days did not 
discourage the citizens. They came in great numbers to take part 
in the march that took place under the snow. Young people 
expressed their joy by throwing snowballs. 
  According to demonstrators belonging to mass organizations 
(the UNJA and UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers] in 
particular), local FLN National Liberation Front] 
representatives, including one member of the Central Committee, 
did not hesitate to put pressure on their militants to prevent 
them from taking part in the march. These FLN officials intended 
to continue boycotting what the country started after the 
National Conference of 25 January. 
  This demonstration of the Bordj-Bou-Arreridj civil society 
can be improved upon. But it remains independent from 
politicians' calculations. 
<H5>  In Setif </H5>
  On Wednesday morning, in spite of the bitter cold and 
driving 
rain mixed with snow, hundreds of Setif governorate citizens 
made it a point to express their support to the chief of State, 
Mr. Liamine Zeroual, by organizing a march through the streets 
and main avenues of the governorate seat. 
  Thus, participants from all walks of life, representing 
civil 
society, took part in the march, carrying banners and calling to 
the fight against terrorism and for a total break with the 
former regime. 
  We should mention that the march ended with a motion of 
support for the chief of State, Mr. Liamine Zeroual, which was 
read to the audience and in which citizens repeated their 
demands for the institution of a modern state and a return to 
the moral and cultural values of the Algerian people. 
<H5>  In Touggourt </H5>
  Last Tuesday, over 3,000 citizens of Touggourt--a town 
located 160 km from the governorate center--organized a march in 
support of President Liamine Zeroual's recent speech to the 
nation. 
  During the march, which was organized by local social and 
cultural associations, the demonstrators displayed banners in 
which they called for the preservation of national unity and 
recourse to dialogue, while denouncing the use of violence to 
solve political problems. 
  After the march, which ended at the district seat, the 
organizers read a motion of support to President Liamine 
Zeroual, whom they called a man of integrity and a patriot. They 
also denounced foreign interference in Algeria's internal 
affairs. 
  The participants also expressed their profound attachment to 
national values and their conviction that pursuing the dialogue 
is the only sure way to achieve stability and find a global 
solution to the present crisis. 
<H5>  At Ouargla </H5>
  At Ouargla, yesterday, several hundreds of people took part 
in a march to support President Liamine Zeroual and his recent 
speech to the nation. 
  Organized by local popular associations and organizations, 
the march brought together citizens of both sexes and all ages, 
carrying banners and shouting slogans to express their support 
to the president, denouncing violence, calling for an end to the 
bloodshed in Algeria, and appealing to society to unite and 
build a strong and prosperous Algerian nation. 
  The demonstrators started from Place Sedrata and headed for 
the governorate seat, where a motion was read in which they 
expressed their support to Mr. Liamine Zeroual, and emphasized 
the need for a serious debate to overcome the crisis, and their 
commitment to help bring Algerians together and put an end to 
violence and bloodshed. 
<H5>  At Annaba </H5>
  Union leaders of the Annaba governorate held a general 
meeting this Wednesday at the town's union college, and 
expressed their "support to Mr. Liamine Zeroual's appointment as 
chief of State which they believe represents a guarantee of 
reinforced national unity and the materialization of the 
strength of political authority." 
  In addition to supporting any political measure aiming to 
ensure stability in the country, end criminal attacks, establish 
law and order, and stimulate the national economy, union leaders 
promised "to oppose any attempt against national unity, the 
nation's values, and the principles of the glorious November 
revolution." 
  "The defense of the basic interests of the working class and 
the preservation of its dignity, under the law, with no 
demagoguery or maneuvers to involve it in political 
confrontations, remain, according to union leaders, immutable 
principles dictated by their commitment to putting the nation's 
highest interest ahead of any other consideration, in the name 
of a united Algeria and the principles of the November 
revolution." 
<H5>  Students' March in Tizi-Ouzou; No to the `Zaouia' University </H5>
  Yesterday, in Tizi-Ouzou, thousands of university and 
high-school students answered the call to march issued by the 
local students' committee. 
  A march had already been scheduled for last Sunday, but it 
was not authorized and did not take place. 
  At the opening of the national conference on universities, 
the local students' committee organized a march to protest 
against exclusion and the policy aiming to sell off the 
university. 
  The march started around 1030 at the Hasnaoua campus. As 
soon 
as the participants had gathered, squares were formed, with 
banners reading: "Repeal first; national conference later," "No 
to university selloff," etc. The demonstrators also shouted 
slogans such as "Djeba bara," "Outdated system," "Enough is 
enough; the university has its honor." All the way, from the 
Hasnaoua campus to the hospital, the cultural center, and the 
governorate seat, university and high-school students shouted 
their rejection of ministerial circulars and their hope in a 
modern university. The students themselves were in charge of 
controlling the crowd, and they did so impeccably. 
  During the demonstration, a spokesman for the students' 
committee told us: "We are always mobilized; we are determined 
to struggle to the end, for the pure and simple repeal of the 
circular." Concerning the opening of the national conference, he 
said: "Our efforts came after a vague protest movement. We set a 
condition for our participation; the circular must be repealed 
(...). 
  Circular 22/23 of 1993 deals with students' orientation and 
evaluation, disqualifying marks, and the exam system. 
  During the entire march, students denounced the system that 
is turning the university into a "zaouia." 
  On reaching the end point, one committee member stated: "The 
committee thanks the 15 high-school students who contributed 
their support to the march, as well as the citizens who answered 
the call. We shall continue our struggle for a new university 
project in Tizi-Ouzou." 
  A biology student told us: "The future of the University is 
at stake; it is the entire school system that must be 
redesigned." Right after the march, the crowd scattered 
peacefully, with hope in their hearts. 
  According to the organizers, "the march was a success; we 
will remain mobilized until our demands are met and until we 
have a new University project." Note that, as the march went by, 
the town's merchants pulled down their shutters until the 
demonstration was over.

  [Text] In trying to explain newly installed President 
Liamine Zeroual's decision yesterday to keep [Prime Minister] 
Redha Malek in place, it might be too pretentious to say, as in 
the world of sports, that you do not change a winning team. But 
the experts will tell you not to change the line-up in the 
middle of a critical game. 
  Has Mr. Redha Malek, who succeeds himself in the position he 
has occupied since last August, been retained because on balance 
the new president rated his government's record of 
accomplishment the last five months as positive? Or was it 
rather to allow him to finish the internal and external work he 
took such great pains to launch? Perhaps both reasons came into 
play in the decision. In the view of many observers, Mr. Redha 
Malek's continuation as head of government is no real surprise, 
despite rumors about his possible departure and possible 
successors. 
  What history will judge most important about the "old-new" 
prime minister was a symbolic gesture that shows there has been 
a change for the better in Algerian politics: Mr. Redha Malek 
hastened to submit his government's resignation as soon as Mr. 
Zeroual took the oath of office. 
  As for the government's record of accomplishment, although 
it 
is difficult to give a meaningful assessment of a government 
team so soon after its inception, Mr. Redha Malek does have to 
his credit a number of achievements, which it will be up to him 
now to consolidate. It is above all in the economic sphere that 
the head of government's style contrasts most sharply with his 
predecessors' orientation. 
  Accelerated movement--to all appearances quite 
resolute--toward a market economy was what most notably 
distinguished the Redha Malek government. The path ahead is thus 
well marked. His reinstallation as head of government under Mr. 
Zeroual is first of all a confirmation of a commitment shared by 
the new leadership. In the social sphere, Mr. Redha Malek has 
succeeded where his predecessors failed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Few Ideas"] </F>
  [Text] The new president, Mr. Liamine Zeroual, defense 
minister since July 1993, has spoken to the Algerian people only 
twice: on 24 October 1993, in an interview with the Algerian 
press agency, and on 16 January 1994, in a televised interview. 
The moment chosen for the latter event was rather significant. 
It coincided with the anniversary of the late President 
Boudiaf's return to Algeria. 
  The tenor of the defense minister's words was reminiscent of 
the assassinated president and seemed to connect up with the 
latter's vision of the path, which the country needs to take to 
end the crisis. 
  His speech, broadcast in prime time, offered a highly 
critical assessment--one such as Boudiaf himself never hesitated 
to give--of the country's plight and the behavior of the 
political class (the parties and the political authorities). 
Observers noted that no one was spared, not even the de facto 
regime, starting with the HCE [Higher State Council]. 
  His analysis did not lead into the issues of security and 
reestablishment of order and thus implied the answer to the 
country's problems must be sought elsewhere. According to Mr. 
Zeroual, the solution lies in "establishment of a new national 
system that enshrines real democracy, guarantees all individual 
and social freedoms, and puts a definitive end to political, 
economic, cultural, and ideological monopolies." 
  Implantation of this new system will entail "a real break 
with the practices and administrative methods of the past at 
every political, economic, and social level," the defense 
minister said. 
  "The break that we believe so essential and we hope to 
realize," he continued, "must bring about radical change in the 
machinery of the state, and its components must respect new 
parameters." 
  Nor should the human factor be ignored, according to the 
defense minister, because "this new system will permit the 
emergence of new people capable of making changes and taking 
concrete steps to realize the nation's aspirations toward peace, 
progress, brotherhood, and Algeria's rehabilitation as a member 
of the family of nations." 
  Mr. Zeroual laid out a veritable political program, 
enumerating the diverse aspects of the crisis and advocating the 
remedial measures needed for a return to political, economic, 
and social stability. 
  The interview published on 24 October 1993 offers further 
clues to the thinking of the man who just became the country's 
top leader. He asserts, for example, that "the ANP [People's 
National Army] is a republican army that believes in democratic 
institutions, political alternation, multiparty pluralism, and a 
state of law." 
  The army's current political involvement: "is solely for the 
purpose of preserving national unity, reestablishing civil 
peace, and opening up new prospects for our country, thanks to 
which resort to violence as a means of political expression--and 
all forms of political, ideological, and economic 
monopolies--will be abolished forever." 
  But it must be understood, Mr. Zeroual cautions, "and no one 
should lose sight of the fact, that the ANP cannot remain 
indifferent toward anything that might be of critical importance 
for the country's future." He thus condemns, unequivocally and 
categorically, the religious extremism shown by fundamentalists 
who have opted for armed and destructive action. "We cannot 
think of an example anywhere else in the world," he said, "where 
an extremist movement, whatever its credo, has made such vicious 
attacks on the people's property, their factories, their 
schools, and even sought the physical elimination of cadres and 
ordinary citizens." 
  Freedom of the press "is a fundamental right and an 
essential 
condition in a society that aspires for transparency," Mr. 
Zeroual said in October 1993, adding that he would "certainly 
expect to be available to the media and improve relations with 
the press." 
  "We support the people's right to truly informative and 
edifying news about doings and events. But we are against 
slanted `revelations' in the media," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Salim Ghazi: "`El Djorf': Oddysey of an </F>
Arms-Trafficking Freighter"] 
  [Text] Several days ago the cargo vessel El Djorf, owned by 
the National Maritime Transport Company (SNTM/CNAN), was stopped 
and boarded by Port of Algiers security forces. It was 
transporting a considerable quantity of military weaponry 
destined for distribution throughout the country. 
  The lot of weapons found hidden in the cabins consisted of 
20 
pump-action 12-mm rifles made by three different manufacturers, 
15 6.65-mm automatic pistols, ammunition for hunting rifles and 
handguns, several cylindrical cases containing sighting pieces 
for rifles and machine-pistols, infrared binoculars, telescopes, 
and ultramodern transmitting and receiving stations. Dozens of 
seamen were arrested and several of them turned over to the 
Algiers public prosecutor. (Another freighter, the 7,400-ton Ibn 
Sirradj, belonging to the same company, was reportedly boarded 
by security forces who suspected it was transporting the same 
type of merchandise. However, it turned out the vessel was 
carrying no weapons.) How could this arsenal have been taken on 
board, and who financed this spectacular transaction? 
  The key to the investigation was the arrest and subsequent 
confession of Mialet Hacene, a crewman on the ship in question 
and the man allegedly responsible for transshipment of the 
merchandise to El Djorf while it moored alongside another vessel 
at the Belgian port of Anvers. 
  This vessel was an 8,100-ton freighter built in the 1970's 
and mostly used for "tramping" (transporting varied merchandise 
in bulk); it belongs to ULN, a regular shipping company serving 
the Europe-North America zone. 
  Under interrogation, Mialet Hacene admitted to security 
officials that certain individuals had contacted him and 
insisted he take some merchandise on board without telling him 
exactly what it was. As he tells it, he was not in a position to 
refuse because they would have threatened to take revenge on his 
family. 
  Hacene stated he was to go to the German port of Hamburg to 
meet an Algerian named Djamel Ressaf who was to provide him with 
the "packages." However, an unexplained hitch forced changes in 
the original plan, and the transfer point was shifted to the 
Belgian port of Anvers. The merchandise, delivered by the same 
individual, was taken on board El Djorf unknown to the vessel's 
captain, officers, and some of the crew. 
  We recall that Djamel Ressaf, then a fugitive in France, was 
sentenced in absentia to death by the Special Court of Algiers 
for his role in the terrorist attack that destroyed Houari 
Boumediene International Airport. 
  Twelve charges had been preferred against him. According to 
the remand order, he participated with Hocine Abderrahim, Said 
Soussen, and Zouaoui in the meeting held at El Biar to plan the 
terrorist operation. In July 1993 he was arrested by French 
security after expiration of his visitor permit. Nine months 
later, Ressaf's trail led to Germany and later Belgium. Was he 
deported to one of these countries after his arrest by French 
security? Kebir? The possibility cannot be ruled out, especially 
since Kebir, as former spokesman for the former FIS [Islamic 
Salvation Front], and Oussama Madani, as treasurer, were the 
only ones with access to the dissolved party's funds, which are 
now deposited in banks overseas. 
  Ressaf Djamel, who also traveled in Sweden on false identity 
papers, was apparently in constant contact with Oussama Madani. 
Indeed, it was thanks to this person that Oussama Abassi met in 
September 1991 with Bachir Benzeguir, alias "Abu Tarek," the 
self-proclaimed "leader" of a Stockholm "cell" of the former FIS 
and author of several incendiary communiques, notably the one 
threatening German interests after German police arrested Kebir 
and Oussama in July of last year. 
  It would seem, then, that militants of the dissolved 
Islamist 
party who are now at large in Europe--including several sought 
by Algerian justice for terrorist crimes--are still able to find 
enough complaisance and accomplices to circulate freely on the 
Old Continent. What is worse, these terrorists even go so far as 
to flout host-country authorities by indulging in arms 
trafficking for the purpose of destabilizing Algeria. But the 
question of the day is whether there now exists a maritime 
arms-trafficking ring in addition to those identified as 
operating across our land borders. Its existence would explain 
many mysteries, such as the provenance of certain types of arms, 
including Israeli Uzis and Czech Scorpios. 
  When it agreed to grant asylum to these terrorists, did 
Europe fully appreciate the serious consequences of such a 
decision?

  [Excerpts] Washington, Feb. 11 KYODO -- [passage omitted] 
  All these efforts are essential, but there is another, even 
greater challenge. The end of the Cold War has created new 
opportunities for arms control and disarmament. One of Japan's 
major goals is to strengthen the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty] system for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. 
That is why one of the first international policy decisions I 
made after becoming prime minister asserted Japan's strong 
support for the indefinite extension of the NPT beyond 1995. 
  There have been reports in the last few days that Japan 
might 
change its policy should North Korea arm itself with nuclear 
weapons. I wish the people who write such reports would come to 
Japan and talk to our people. Then they would realize how deeply 
we feel about this issue. Let me be very clear on this point: I 
see no possibility that Japan would decide to become a nuclear 
power. Such a policy would be against Japan's national interest. 
We, like you, are very concerned about the current situation on 
the Korean peninsula. And we are determined, working closely 
with government leaders in the Republic of Korea and America, to 
help settle this issue. 
  On the issue of conventional arms control, Japan also is 
actively involved. We are the only major nation in the world 
which is not selling any weapons to other countries. We have 
proposed a UN-supervised system to make it easier to monitor 
international sales of conventional arms. We want to broaden 
this system, to make it more effective.

  [Text] To hide them from the eyes of international 
inspectors, the regime of tyrant Saddam Husayn has been 
transferring its remaining chemical and biological weapons from 
one place to another. According to people who recently arrived 
in Amman, the dictatorial regime began using the oil 
pipelines--out of operation because of the international 
embargo--in one last attempt to hide its banned weapons.

  [Text] Manama, Feb 11 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency has set up two cameras at an Iraqi nuclear site 
under UN resolutions for the long-term monitoring of the 
country's arms program, an IAEA official said here Friday. 
  "Two close-circuit cameras have been installed and activated 
in an engineering facility at Um al-Ma'arik (Mother of All 
Battles), 20 minutes from Baghdad, with two film cameras as a 
back-up," said Gary Dillon, a Briton, about the site that was 
part of Iraq's enriched uranium production program. 
  "The work was carried out without a hitch and the Iraqis 
were 
cooperative," said Dillon about his seven-member IAEA team that 
just completed a week-long mission in Iraq. 
  On Feb 4, IAEA deputy chief Maurizio Zifferero said experts 
from his agency would remove the last batch of Iraq's irradiated 
fuel and start setting up cameras at former nuclear sites. 
  The team was to have arranged removal of the five kilograms 
(11 pounds) of fuel believed to be left in Iraq. Some 35 
kilograms (77 pounds) were removed on December 5. 
  "The IAEA team will be back within two months to continue 
their work of installing surveillance cameras at maybe two or 
three more sites, where up to 20 cameras may be set up in 
total," Dillon said. 
  Another 11 chemical weapons experts, led by Horst Reeps from 
Germany, accompanied Dillon's team on Friday. It completed a 
10-day mission to identify and collect equipment Iraq had used 
in producing chemical weapons. 
  "We completed our mission of identifying, tagging and filing 
250 pieces of chemical production equipment of dual use nature. 
Part of these were used during the Iran-Iraq war," Reeps said. 
  "Our main aim was to get more information on the planned use 
of this equipment in the future. Iraq has said it intends to 
make use of them for the production of pesticides, 
pharmaceuticals and other chemicals," he said. 
  He said that some of the equipment was never used, some used 
on a regular basis and some would be the subject of new 
discussions with the Iraqis on their planned use. 
  In the hope of obtaining an end to a three-year embargo, 
Iraqi authorities are cooperating with efforts to dismantle 
programs for making weapons of mass destruction which are banned 
under UN resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war. 
  The embargo was imposed four days after Iraq's forces 
invaded 
Kuwait in August 1990.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Feb (INA)--Lt. Gen. Engineer 'Amir 
Muhammad Rashid, director of the Military Industrialization 
Organization [MIO], has expressed amazement over the 
contradictions contained in the statements Ambassador Rolf 
Ekeus, executive chairman of the UN Special Commission, made to 
the U.S. television Cable News Network [CNN], yesterday, 
Tuesday, 15 February. 
  In a statement to INA, Lt. Gen. Rashid added that in his 
statements, Ekeus gave the impression that Iraq continues to 
withhold information on chemical weapons. 
  The MIO director urged the chairman of the UN Special 
Commission to shoulder his responsibilities fairly, to confine 
himself to the tasks of the UN Special Commission as spelled out 
in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and to steer 
clear of the U.S. anti-Iraq political maneuvers and pressures, 
which have nothing to do with the UN security Council 
resolutions. 
  The following is the text of the statement: 
  MIO Director General Lt. Gen. 'Amir Muhammad Rashid has 
said: 
We have received with extreme amazement the statements 
Ambassador Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman of the UN Special 
Commission, made to CNN on 15 February 1994. 
  In these statements, Ekeus gave the impression that Iraq 
continues to withhold part of the information pertaining to 
chemical weapons. As a matter of fact, Ekeus has made it clear 
in letters addressed to me that Iraq has provided the required 
information regarding its previous programs, that this 
information is credible and comprehensive, and that it is 
sufficient for the purposes of the UN Special Commission, as 
enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. 
Hence, his recent pronouncements and statements to CNN 
misrepresent facts, and contradict the documents he himself has 
submitted to the UN Security Council. 
  Lt. Gen. Rashid said: It has become clear to us, 
particularly 
after Iraq accepted Resolution 715 in November 1993, that 
Ambassador Ekeus makes himself part of the U.S. political 
maneuvers which seek to prolong the unjust blockade imposed on 
Iraq. Therefore, he makes contradictory statements serving in 
fact the purpose of U.S. maneuvers. 
  Rashid continued: We ask the chairman of the Special 
Commission to shoulder his responsibilities in an objective 
manner, adhere to the Commission's tasks as defined by the UN 
Security Council resolutions, and dissociate himself from the 
U.S. anti-Iraq maneuvers and political pressure which has 
nothing to do with the Security Council resolutions. 
  On Ekeus statements on the effects of the blockade on the 
Iraqi people and his arbitrary criticism of Iraq for not 
implementing what he called a mechanism presented to it by the 
United Nations to sell a fixed amount of oil to buy food and 
medicine under international supervision, Rashid said: First, 
this subject is not within the jurisdiction of the chairman of 
the Special Commission. It is within the jurisdiction of the UN 
general secretariat. Second, Ekeus wants to dissociate himself 
from being largely responsible for continuing the blockade 
imposed on Iraq and hence the continuation of the Iraqi people's 
suffering. This is because under U.S. pressure, Ekeus is 
reluctant to tell the truth which he knows only too well; 
namely, that Iraq has abided by UN resolutions. Had he 
possessed the courage and objectivity required from an 
international official, he would have presented his report on 
this issue to the Security Council, thus, leading to the 
implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and ending the 
Iraqi peoples suffering. The blame he levels at Iraq because it 
rejects arrangements that infringe on its sovereignty and 
dignity is blatantly ridiculous.

  [Text] Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has 
asserted that Iraq has complied with Security Council Resolution 
687 on weapons of mass destruction and no longer has any of 
these weapons or the capacity to manufacture them. 
  In a statement to Qatari state television last night, he 
said 
that although Iraq implemented the provisions of that 
resolution, it is repeatedly accused of failure to abide by 
international resolutions for political reasons and to maintain 
the blockade imposed on it. 
  He added that U.S.-led foreign parties in the Security 
Council have political purposes unrelated to the [Gulf] crisis. 
  This is the second time the Qatari television has held an 
interview with Iraqi officials. A week ago, it aired a report 
on the unjust blockade, including an interview with Trade 
Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih.

<F P=106> [Article by Arif Pasalic, Brigadier-General of the Army of </F>
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina: "Aerosol Carries Death"] 
  [Text] The aggressor has several times, through its 
official representatives, announced the use of a new weapon that 
was supposed to speed up the achievement of the set military 
goal of the war. These announcements (the aim of which was to 
frighten) have practically been actualized already. 
  The enemy started using the new weapon late last month. It 
is an aerosol-type missile. The remains of such missiles were 
found above the village of Buca Potok. 
  The analysis of the position of the missile parts, the 
location of the strike, in the ballistic sense, has shown that 
the missile was fired from Krivoglavci. 
  Considering that this is a new weapon in this war, we are 
obliged to provide the public with specific information on what 
kind of weapon is in question. Aerosol explosives were first 
mentioned in literature as early as in 1960, and from 1966 there 
were practical applications of aerosol explosives in the form of 
bombs dropped from planes and helicopters. The term "aerosol" 
means a heterogeneous mixture of air and solid or liquid 
particles. 
  An aerosol explosive, in fact a mixture of volatile 
hydrocarbons (ethylene-oxide and propylene-oxide), and aluminum 
nitrate -- aluminum powder -- is already used in practice. 
Soaps are used as cohesion material. As opposed to classical 
solid explosives, the aerosol explosive has greater energy, 
chemical reactions occur more easily during the explosion 
process, the shock wave speed is greater, it has a lower level 
of super-pressure, and it has a longer-lasting effect. 
  These explosion characteristics allow for a greater 
destructive potential. During the explosion, the aerosol 
explosion cloud enters every gap (above the shelter, below the 
shelter, trees, and the shelter areas), and then explodes, the 
explosion being powerful and long -- the wave is most frequently 
lethal. The shock wave destroys lungs, pierces eardrums and 
other organs, and the air bubbles often enter the circulatory 
system (stopping in the heart or brain), which causes a quick 
death. The shock wave of the explosion of a 200-kg aerosol 
warhead causes death within a 60-meter diameter. 
  This kind of weapon is known to be possessed by the United 
States (who used it in the Vietnam war), Russia, France, and 
Israel, and it is very likely that China has also produced them. 
The former JNA [Yugoslav National Army] was interested in 
acquiring and producing this kind of weapon, but, despite 
research conducted in the institutes (Vinca), it was not 
possible to fully master the technology and production. 
Considering the most abusive way of using such explosives, in 
air bombs and missiles (the "FRY" has had difficulties with the 
production of missile fuel), it may be concluded that the 
weapons used did not originate, nor were they produced, on the 
territory of the "FRY." 
  To launch an aerosol-type warhead, the Serb-Chetnik 
aggressor 
forces use the Grad missile system (produced in Russia -- the 
Soviet Union). The analysis of the remains of the missile 
showed that it had been produced very recently in the factories 
and institutes of Russia, which indicates a specific breaking of 
the embargo by the "FRY" and Russia. So far, some 10 such 
missiles have been used on the frontlines in the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Judging from an analysis of past use of this weapon by the 
Chetnik aggressors, it is likely that they will continue to use 
the Grad missiles with aerosol warheads, and write primitive 
messages on them, as is characteristic of them, and typical of 
their senses and their fascist ideology ("We will fuck your 
mothers, you Turks").

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Kolesnichenko] </F>
  [Text] New York, 28 Feb -- The American corporation 
"Gerardo International," which works on developing secret 
weapons systems for the Pentagon, thinks that Aldrich Ames, 
arrested last week on suspicion of spying for the former USSR 
and then for Russia, could have supplied Moscow with secrets of 
the production of a new invention of the company -- the 
so-called "MRX" defense technology. The president of the 
corporation, Neil Gerardo, expressed his anxiety at this 
circumstance in a letter to Congressman (John Mike) (Republican, 
Florida), which has been made available to the ITAR-TASS office 
in New York. 
  The document notes in particular that the company's 
management became concerned when one of its staff in Belgium 
reported the details of a Reuter interview with LDRP [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia]) leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in 
which the latter declared for the first time that Russia had an 
ultra-secret offensive weapon called "Elipton." The description 
of this mysterious weapon given by Zhirinovskiy turned out to be 
similar to the "MRX" defense technology developed in the 
"Gerardo International" laboratories. 
  "Our company, like many other institutions that are 
developing high-technology weapons systems, knew of and welcomed 
the actions of the U.S. Government's intelligence departments in 
monitoring our lines of communication, because this met the aims 
of national security," the letter pointed out. "Today our 
anxiety has increased even more after the arrest of Aldrich Ames 
on suspicion of supplying secret information to Moscow. We in 
`Gerardo International' have done everything possible to keep 
the `MRX' production methods a secret. However, after the 
events that have taken place we fear that the technologies of 
this system have been 'blown'. We call on Congress to carry out 
a thorough investigation of this urgent matter. We should like 
to know how many people, and precisely who, have access to 
information on the 'MRX' production technologies." 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent called a representative of 
"Gerardo International," but he flatly refused to comment on the 
letter, saying that as yet he had nothing to add to the above 
version.

  [Text] The press center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
advises that the presence of the Russian arms has been 
increasing on the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefields. Beside some 
modified dated types of arms, some very modern arms have been 
arriving on this battlefield recently. At the end of January, a 
convoy consisting of eight trailers sent from Russia crossed 
onto Bosnia-Herzegovina territory near Raca, carrying arms for 
the needs of the aggressor's Chetnik army. The trailers 
contained Elipton bombs -- most likely the arms that 
Zhirinovskiy referred to during his visit to the so-called 
Serbian Republic, alleging that this was the new secret weapon 
of great destructive power -- a surface-to-air missile of 
unknown type, and antiaircraft guns of Russian manufacture. 
  When the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina started in April 1992, 
the 
former Yugoslav Peoples' Army disposed of three missile 
surface-to-air systems, namely: SA-2 [Guideline], SA-3 [GOA], 
and SA-6 [Gainful]. We have received confirmation from several 
sources that the aggressor has strengthened its antiaircraft 
defense over Bosnia-Herzegovina considerably and introduced 
missile systems that not even the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army 
had before the war. All these systems are of Russian 
manufacture, namely: SA-8 [Gecko], SA-9 [Gaskin], and SA-14 
[NATO code name not known]. The SA-13 (Gopher] and SA-11 
[Gadfly] also form part of the aggressor's antiaircraft defense. 
These systems are supported from the territory of the so-called 
Yugoslavia by SA-12 [Gladiator] missiles. 
  A new missile antiaircraft system has appeared on Mount 
Bjelasnica and Mount Igman last year that was not identified. 
  The presence of a giant (Cumen) 240-mm caliber mortar, whose 
bombs weight 130 kg, has been observed at several places 
throughout the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefield. The (Cumen) 
fires destructive chemical and nuclear bombs, which means that 
it does not use classic mortar grenades. Its barrel is 5.5 m 
long and its range is 9.5 kilometers. The giant weapon weighs 4 
tonnes. This mortar was also spotted in positions around 
Sarajevo. 
  Bearing in mind the number of destroyed tanks on this 
battlefield and the number of tanks held by the army of the 
so-called Serbian Republic, it is evident that their hardware is 
regularly replenished. Tanks that had earlier not even formed 
part of the armament of the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army, for 
example, T-72 tanks, have appeared on this battlefield on 
several occasions. These tanks, which carried the colors, the 
markings, and the numbers of the Russian Army have also taken 
part in some of the battles, the press center of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports. 
  Together with these arms, large contingents of men have been 
arriving who are servicing them and training members of the 
Chetnik artillery units. It is also well known that contingents 
of fully armed and equipped mercenaries are arriving on the 
territory of the so-called Serbian Republic at regular 
intervals. They are not stopped on the Russian border, nor are 
their equipment and arms seized, the press center of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports.

engineering I cannot fail to share my fears at the latest "gift" 
to the Russian people from the munificence of the presidents who 
gathered in Moscow at the start of the year. Let me remind you 
that a year previously there was a similar "gift" in the form of 
the hasty signing of the treaty on the reduction of strategic 
offensive arms --START II-- which, even before it was ratified, 
had played a pernicious role for us. Here I shall dwell only on 
the latest new "partnership" initiatives which develop this 
treaty: the nontargeting of strategic missiles against each 
other, Ukraine's complete elimination of all nuclear weapons, 
and the United States' purchase of Russian weapons-grade uranium. 
  I think there is no better guarantee of stability under 
present conditions than the certainty of our potential for not 
leaving an aggressor unpunished. The correctness of my thoughts 
is confirmed not only by the lessons of history but also by the 
recent conclusions of the international conference in Rio de 
Janeiro, the statements by U.S. Vice President A. Gore, and the 
research of Academician N. Amosov. In that light you cannot 
help concluding that the agreements concluded in Moscow recently 
on the military-economic aspects of cooperation are similar in 
form and anti-Russian in content. Their danger lies in 
definitively depriving Russia of the potential for deterrence, 
in selling off for a song what belongs to its future generations. 
<H5>  Retargeting of Missiles </H5>
  Perhaps this is the most effective confirmation (for the 
uninitiated) of partnership relations between the former 
adversaries. Here there is a political dividend for all 
presidents at the same time and (although extremely implausible) 
a reduction in the gravity of the consequences of the 
unsanctioned launch of any missile: Its lethal charge will 
merely fall into the ocean or onto an uninhabited island. It is 
emphasized, it is true, that it is hardly possible to control 
the targeting information of modern strategic missiles and 
consequently this initiative is allegedly utterly "innocuous." 
  In reality everything will depend on the energy of the 
"partners'" political leadership and the degree of resistance to 
that initiative from military professionals. After all, only 
they know the other side: the loss of combat readiness is more 
dangerous to the victim than to the aggressor; mistakes and 
disruptions during retargeting are fraught with an excessive 
risk of accidents; the computing of missiles' new targeting 
information and the replacement of old ones give rise to 
colossal expenditure; the vigilance and responsibility of the 
combat crew on duty with "untargeted" missiles are reduced; and 
the actions of these crews when they receive a combat order 
becomes drastically more complicated. All this as a whole casts 
doubt on certainty as regards our combat readiness. 
  If this initiative is implemented Russia loses in the combat 
readiness of its multiple-warhead silo-based missiles 
considerable more than the United States. At least several 
minutes essential to re-record the "cancelled" targeting 
information. With our missiles' more radical "retargeting," 
which is indicated by the quite protracted deadline for its 
implementation (nearly five months) tens of minutes, if not 
hours, will be required to restore their combat readiness. In 
all cases our strategic nuclear forces could be deprived of 
their deterrent role in a retaliatory counter-strike, the only 
kind of strike acceptable to us, and will then be destroyed if 
necessary by high-precision, diversionary or other weapons. 
  In contrast to us, the U.S. side remains in a more 
advantageous position. After all, its combat might is based on 
high-precision cruise missiles and submarine-launched ballistic 
missiles. To all appearances it is not proposed to retarget the 
former and it is pointless to retarget the latter: They are 
already continuously and automatically retargeted in the process 
of combat patrol. It is virtually impossible to deprive them of 
this potential, still less to monitor the removal of targeting 
information from naval missiles. 
  You ask: Why was the United States previously skeptical 
about our statement on the nontargeting of Russian missiles on 
U.S. territory but is now itself coming out with a similar 
initiative? I think the reason here lies in the sincere 
readiness of present-day Russia's top political echelons to 
undertake unilateral disarmament. Nor is there any doubt that a 
gamble is being taken on the military's impotence: After all, 
it was the Russian Federation Defense Ministry leaders and above 
all the Strategic Rocket Forces who unconditionally agreed to 
the "destabilizing" role of our multiple-warhead silo-based 
missiles in favor of single-warhead mobile missiles. 
<H5>  Ukraine's Disarmament </H5>
  The surprising attention paid toward the problem of 
"Ukrainian" nuclear weapons, including by the new U.S. 
President, is generated by the same overtly expressed U.S. 
desire for absolute military superiority but not through its own 
arms upgrading but through the weakening of potential 
adversaries. It is Ukraine's obstinacy over adopting 
nuclear-free status and, worse, its intention to keep 46 of the 
most modern multiple-warhead silo-based SS-24 missiles with 460 
warheads which are not only preventing the destruction of 
similar Russian SS-18 missiles under START II but are also 
casting doubt on the U.S. THAAD antimissile program (a cheap 
SDI). 
  With the United States' present unconditional supremacy in 
offensive arms both conventional and nuclear, it also wants to 
have a guaranteed antimissile defense. The multiple-warhead 
silo-based missiles are an obstacle. Even the full-scale SDI, 
never mind its truncated version, cannot intercept their 
numerous warheads. The missiles on our submarines and the 
single-warhead SS-25 missiles are another matter: They have a 
minimal chance even of flying since as a result of their lack of 
defense they could easily be destroyed beforehand on their 
patrol routes or at the points of permanent deployment. If some 
of them do survive they will be able to take off only one after 
another and there will be very few of them (no more than 100) so 
the United States needs only a relatively cheap ground-based ABM 
system -- in other words the last stage of SDI geared to the 
destruction of up to 200 nuclear missiles. 
  Those are the reasons for B. Clinton's entirely natural 
interest in Ukrainian nuclear status and the United States' as 
yet unrealized wish to review the two first articles of the 1972 
ABM treaty formally banning the creation of even a restricted 
territorial ABM system. Thus very few obstacles are left on the 
path toward undivided rule and absolute impunity for any actions. 
  America's position can be understood but is unacceptable, 
not 
only to Russia and Ukraine, but also to the rest of the world. 
There are at least two reasons for this: The satisfaction of 
U.S. ambitions will not increase stability in the world and, if 
it does not immediately plunge the world into fresh anarchy, 
will at any rate make it violent. The U.S. pragmatists' 
cynicism is striking: After all, they intend to implement the 
United States' attainment of absolute military supremacy and its 
own safety at other people's expenses, primarily at Russian 
expense. 
  What lies behind their impudent treatment of "sovereign 
Ukraine?" The removal of its natural right to choose the 
minimum necessary and effective strategic deterrent means will 
hardly be compensated for by illusory economic and military 
guarantees. The billion promised for weapons-grade uranium plus 
the further two billion in the form of possible IMF credits will 
hardly resurrect its economy. Expectations for an even greater 
reduction by the Russian side of prices for energy carriers 
exported for the Ukrainians are also obviously naive: Prices on 
the world market have already been made as cheap as possible 
through the zeal of the Americans. 
<H5>  Uranium Deal </H5>
  But however paradoxical it may seem, the most destructive 
thing for Russia will be its "breakthrough" to the market in 
enriched uranium, where the Americans have always ruled. Nor 
will they lose our this time. If Russia received 12 billion for 
500 tonnes of uranium sold to the United States, the Americans 
as a result will pocket at least 300 billion -- such is the 
profitability of this "deal of the century." After all, the 
main second-hand dealer under the contract is the "Enrichment 
Corporation" firm, which has retained the right to review the 
terms of the deal annually, naturally in the direction of 
reducing the purchase price. 
  Most striking of all was official Moscow's agreement to the 
long term nature of this contract. After all, it is already 
known that at present world extraction rates the stocks of 
natural uranium, oil, and gas are sufficient for 50 years. Nor 
do we have guarantees of the development of thermonuclear energy 
and plutonium reactors. Having lost two thirds of its uranium 
sources with the collapse of the USSR, Russia is now selling 
nearly all its released weapons-grade uranium?! Without uranium 
nuclear electric power stations you will not get far with coal, 
logs, and hydroelectric power stations. 
  The actual atmosphere in which the "uranium deal" was 
prepared and the interpretation of this agreement for the public 
are also interesting. Nuclear Power Minister V. Mikhaylov, who 
explained to the Americans the figures for the quantity of 
weapons-great uranium we have and the number of nuclear 
warheads, took a most active part in creating a halo of "dire 
necessity" around this step. Since the revised figures exceeded 
estimates so far available by approximately 50 percent, this was 
reflected in a reduction of purchase prices for uranium. Having 
bought it the Americans will be able right now to resell the 
uranium at three to five times the price, and what will the 
price be in 20 years? 
  Nor can we fail to note one more aspect of this affair -- 
its 
link with our unilateral disarmament under START II. Russia's 
selling off of its uranium will have a deplorable effect on 
international stability. After all, even potentially Russia 
will be deprived of the opportunity to play a deterrent role 
since it will be unable to step up its nuclear potential in the 
event of a drastic aggravation of the situation. And who will 
guarantee that the need for this step will not be provoked by 
Washington itself, for instance, as a result of its unilateral 
rejection of ABM restrictions? In contrast to us, the United 
States retains its weapons-grade plutonium together with nuclear 
warheads and the platforms for them. 
  As a result the "uranium deal" will deprive our heirs of 
fuel 
for nuclear power engineering, no alternative to which can yet 
be seen, leaving in exchange mountains of radioactive waste. 
  I am sure that Russia does not need such bilateral and 
trilateral agreements. Their time passed with the collapse of 
the USSR, when it was possible and necessary to agree with the 
United States "as equals." With present realities, with the 
existence of only one superpower, all the others must be 
concerned for their own self-preservation autonomously or by 
cooperating. Russia and Ukraine need an independent military 
technology policy: We cannot do without the minimum necessary 
number of multiple-warhead silo-based missiles. We must 
preserve and modernize the existing 50 Ukrainian SS-24 missiles 
and 200 Russian SS-18 missiles together, helping each other. 
  I should like our parliaments to find the time to 
investigate 
and look into the results promised to us by the results of the 
Moscow meeting of presidents. I think the way out of the 
situation which is taking shape lies in the unification of the 
fraternal Slav and other peoples who have lived together since 
time immemorial in the face of the now real threat of their 
"depersonalization" and extinction and the "Europeanization" and 
"Americanization" of their natural resources. Instead of 
fueling passions over the nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory 
we must render Ukraine aid in ensuring their safeguarding and, 
if we are asked, in preserving some part of them. After all, we 
are also in extreme need of Ukraine's assistance in maintaining 
the combat readiness of the heavy Russian SS-18 missiles. 
  Russia's all-around cooperation with Ukraine in the military 
and economic fields is mutually advantageous. Our countries 
will become richer and stronger as a result. And with the 
good-neighborliness of powers like ours things will be more 
peaceful for others too -- the peoples know that.

  [Text] Moscow February 15 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
of the Russian Federation and John Major, prime minister of the 
United Kingdon of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, issued a 
joint statement here on Tuesday. 
  The statement reads as follows: 
  -- Reaffirming the fundamental importance of the two 
countries' partnership relations, based on the treaty, dated 
November 9, 1992, on the basic principles of relations between 
the Russian Federation and the United Kingdon, 
  -- emphasising that the two countries' cooperation in the 
efforts to strengthen European and global security and build 
non-confrontational international relations is the basic element 
of these partnership relations, 
  -- basing themselves on the discussions of nuclear issues by 
the two sides and proceeding from a desire to make a tangible 
contribution to strengthening strategic stability in the world, 
the president of the Russian Federation and the prime minister 
of the United Kingdom are stating that they will issue the 
necessary instructions on mutual non-targeting of strategic 
nuclear missiles which are under their respective command, so 
that the missile could be non-targeted not later than May 30, 
1994. 
  So, the day-to-day control over the nuclear forces of the 
two 
sides will be exercised in keeping with the mutual recognition 
of the fact that the Russian Federation and the United Kingdon 
are not adversaries.

"Russian-Ukrainian Nuclear Missile Marathon Continues. Kiev Is 
Ready To Get Rid of the Weapons, but After Some Bargaining"] 
  [Text] This week a high-ranking delegation including Yuriy 
Dubinin, special envoy and chief of the Russian Federation state 
delegation to talks with Ukraine; Atomic Energy Minister Viktor 
Mikhaylov; and Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, from the 12th 
Main Directorate of the Defense Ministry, held difficult talks 
in Kiev on specific measures to eliminate Ukrainian nuclear 
weapons. 
  Upon returning to Moscow, Ambassador Yuriy Dubinin told your 
SEGODNYA correspondent that "we have agreed on the content of 
the document that will enable us to implement the agreements on 
eliminating nuclear arms in Ukraine, which were reached by 
Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, and Clinton on 14 January." 
Presently, the results of the talks are being "reported" to the 
presidents of Ukraine and Russia. According to official 
reports, however, President Yeltsin has caught a cold and is 
currently inaccessible. 
  Meanwhile, the Russian and Ukrainian delegations agreed that 
until the results achieved in Kiev are approved, no details 
about the process of the talks should be made public. No press 
conferences. It was disclosed, however, that they had "entirely 
substantive talks in Kiev" that were held in "a constructive and 
businesslike atmosphere." Translated from diplomatic-speak into 
plain language, this usually means a tough showdown. 
  The Kiev military and political establishment had long ago 
decided in principle to get rid of what it sees as costly, 
dangerous, and rather useless nuclear weapons, but the 
bargaining over the deal's specifics is set to be long and 
tedious.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Aleksandrov report in the "In Brief" column] </F>
  [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine's nuclear power industry is on the 
verge of stopping. Nuclear fuel stocks at nuclear power plants 
are running out while fresh supplies from Russia have been 
stopped as of the beginning of this year. The TVEL concern, 
Russia's sole producer of nuclear power fuel, cites the ban by 
the State Committee for Supervision over the Safety of Work in 
Industry and Atomic Power Engineering [Gosatomnadzor]. The 
latter for its part points to the expiration at the end of last 
year of a corresponding interstate Russian-Ukrainian agreement. 
The problem has grown from purely economic into a political 
one. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed its 
Ukrainian colleagues that deliveries of nuclear fuel may be 
resumed only if Ukraine accedes to the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty. The Kiev leadership has asked Chernomyrdin to lift 
restrictions on nuclear fuel deliveries from Russia. It is 
hardly accidental that the conflict has flared up during the 
Russian-Ukrainian negotiations on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament 
in Kiev. It seems that the Russian side decided to play a trump 
which can effectively shut down Ukraine's nuclear power industry.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Aleksandr Gorbovskiy, chief of the </F>
department for issues of chemical weapons of the Committee for 
Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons, 
by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondents Andrey Vaganov and Rodion 
Nikolayev, under the rubric "Position"; place and date not 
given: "Russia Has Not Violated Any Treaties on Chemical 
Weapons. As Far as Destroying These Weapons, It Is as Difficult 
as Creating Them"] 
  [Text] One year ago, Russia was among the first 
countries to sign in Paris the Convention on Prohibition of the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical 
Weapons and on Their Destruction. This event completed the 
proceedings of more than two decades of negotiations at the 
disarmament conference in Geneva. 
  The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons which is headquartered in the Hague (the Netherlands) 
was created in order to carry out the convention and implement 
an international control mechanism. In Russia, the Committee on 
Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons 
was also created in 1992 by an edict of the Russian Federation 
president. The committee was charged with the functions of 
coordination and control in the area of ensuring compliance with 
Russia's international obligations concerning the ban on 
chemical and biological weapons. Professor Aleksandr Gorbovskiy, 
chief of the department for the issues of chemical weapons of 
the committee, answers questions put by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondents. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: Aleksandr Dmitriyevich, what 
is the status of implementing the convention as of today? 
  Gorbovskiy: The convention has been signed. A 
period of two years has been set for participating countries to 
be able to ratify it and prepare to meet their obligations. The 
convention will take effect when no fewer than 65 states ratify 
it. 
  The convention has now been signed by 154 states, but 
ratified by only four countries, which do not have chemical 
weapons and which actually do not have to assume any 
obligations. This is a very serious problem for other countries 
that do have such weapons: The conditions and facilities for the 
destruction of chemical weapons need to be created. 
  The main proportion of the world stockpiles of such weapons 
are concentrated in the United States and Russia. This is why 
the issue of destroying chemical weapons is the most acute for 
these two states. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What does the Russian 
chemical weapons complex amount to? One finds absolutely 
contradictory information in the press. 
  Gorbovskiy: The Russian chemical weapons complex 
means first of all the stockpiles kept at storage facilities. 
The total quantity of the stockpiles has been declared and comes 
to 40,000 tonnes of toxic substances (OV). 
  Russia also has facilities for the production of toxic 
substances. The principal facilities are in Volgograd and 
Novocheboksarsk (Chuvashia). 
  Last year an interdepartmental commission whose task it was 
to inspect all storage facilities for toxic substances verified 
the reliability of chemical weapons storage and provisions for 
the safety of the population. As chairman of the above 
commission, I can confirm the number given--40,000 tonnes. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: Is it possible to say what 
the qualitative composition of these 40,000 tonnes is, and in 
which regions Russian chemical weapons are mostly located? 
  Gorbovskiy: The most up-to-date nerve 
substances--sarin, soman, and V-gas [vi-gaz], account for 
approximately 32,000 tonnes. The remainder consists of obsolete 
substances, mustard gas and lewisite, which have been stored 
since as early as the 1950's. 
  Data on the geography of the locations of such weapons are 
no 
longer secret. We have exchanged information with the Americans 
on the military-chemical facilities; the geographical 
coordinates of their locations precise to the second have been 
provided. All these facilities are located in the European 
section of Russia. 
  We have seven storage sites. Toxic substances (mustard gas, 
lewisite) are kept in containers at two sites. Storage is within 
munitions at five sites. Two storage facilities out of these 
five hold missile and artillery munitions, and three storage 
sites--aircraft chemical munitions. 
  The easternmost facility is in Chelyabinsk Oblast. Those in 
Bryansk and Penza Oblasts are the closest to Moscow. The 40,000 
tonnes are distributed among these storage facilities 
approximately evenly--at 5,000-7,000 tonnes per storage site. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What is the guaranteed shelf 
life of chemical munitions? 
  Gorbovskiy: More than 80 percent of toxic 
substances are found within munitions whose bodies ensure their 
reliable storage. The inspection of arsenals revealed that a 
case of leakage has not been registered at any of them recently. 
  American chemical munitions have thinner shells. This is 
precisely why their chemical munitions have become disabled 
sooner. For example, rocket artillery munitions "leaked" by the 
mid-1970's. The Americans were forced to encase them in concrete 
and dump them in the ocean. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What is 40,000 tonnes equal 
to in terms of, so to say, destruction coefficient? 
  Gorbovskiy: A lethal dose of V-gas, the most 
up-to-date chemical toxic agent, comes to 10 milligrams per 
person. This is a virtually invisible aerosol particle. It is 
easy to calculate the number of potential victims by simple 
division if we know the total stockpiles of chemical weapons. 
However, this would be an incompetent calculation; it does not 
take into account actual conditions for the use of all weapons. 
For example, if we compare how much explosive was used during 
World War II and the number of people who were destroyed, it 
will turn out that there were hundreds of kilograms of 
trinitrotoluene per person killed. 
  The same is the case in the event of combat use of chemical 
weapons--kilograms and tens of kilograms of toxic substances per 
each casualty. Approximately the same casualty rate should also 
be reckoned with during accidents. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What are the specifics of 
Russian problems associated with implementation of the 
provisions of the convention? 
  Gorbovskiy: Unfortunately we have to begin work in 
the area of chemical weapons destruction virtually from scratch. 
After the former USSR announced the discontinuation of chemical 
weapons production (1987), a facility for the destruction of 
toxic substances was created in the vicinity of the city of 
Chapayevsk within a very short period of time. About 100 million 
rubles in 1989 prices were spent to this end. 
  However, this facility was not commissioned, after all. The 
local population protested strongly. Technologies that were 
supposed to be used at the facility were evaluated to be safer 
than American technologies even by specialists from the United 
States. Many other industrial enterprises are located in 
Chapayevsk, and the ecological situation in the region was very 
strained. There was absolutely no opportunity to coordinate the 
commissioning of the facility with the local authorities and the 
public. 
  Subsequently, major studies were done to develop a draft of 
the state program for the destruction of chemical weapons. As a 
result, specialists came to the conclusion that it would be 
safest and most economical to use for destruction available 
former facilities for the production of toxic substances; after 
all, in this case the entire infrastructure did not have to be 
created from scratch. In particular, a plant in the city of 
Novocheboksarsk was proposed (the V-gas toxic substance had been 
produced there previously). However, following discussion of a 
draft program at the beginning of last year, the legislative 
organ of Chuvashia made a decision which ruled out the use of 
the Novocheboksarsk Production Association Khimprom for the 
purpose of destroying a proportion of the stock of chemical 
weapons. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What is the price tag on the 
program for the destruction of chemical weapons? 
  Gorbovskiy: It is very expensive--a few trillion 
rubles. The following concept is now taking shape: Chemical 
weapons will have to be destroyed directly in the area of the 
facilities at which they are stored. A major effort to 
coordinate all issues with the local organs of power and the 
public lies ahead. 
  In conjunction with this, certain articles of an instigatory 
and even intimidating nature seriously harm an objective 
assessment of the situation. Thus, one year ago articles 
appeared in the newspapers of the Republic of Chuvashia about 
V-gas contamination in a 30-kilometer zone around 
Novocheboksarsk. The interdepartmental commission dispatched 
there for a survey did not confirm this fact. Analysis of the 
samples of various media made in specialized laboratories 
indicated an absence of contamination. 
  One more dangerous trend has begun to manifest itself--to 
combine the program for the destruction of chemical weapons with 
the resolution of ecological problems associated with the 
operation of industry as such. All this causes the program to 
become still more expensive. As a result, a situation might 
develop in which Russia will be simply unable to carry out the 
program on time. Meanwhile, according to the convention, the 
first facility for the destruction of toxic substances should 
already be in operation two years after the convention is 
ratified. In five years, 20 percent of the chemical weapons 
should be destroyed, in seven years--50 percent, and in 10 
years--100 percent. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: More than a year ago 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI published the notorious article by Vil 
Mirzoyanov and Lev Fedorov "Poisoned Politics." The trial of one 
of the authors of the article began on Monday. He stands accused 
of divulging state secrets with regard to the development of a 
new type of chemical weapon in our country. Could you comment on 
the situation? 
  Gorbovskiy: At one point I, as a representative of 
the Committee on Convention-Related Problems, provided 
explanations at a briefing concerning charges by Mirzoyanov and 
Fedorov that Russia is violating the international obligations 
it has assumed. I confirm officially that Russia has not 
violated any international agreements in the area of the ban on 
chemical weapons, either at the time this article was written or 
at present. 
  Since the production of toxic substances was discontinued in 
1987, by the USSR, it has not resumed; the plants were either 
mothballed or their output mix was changed. I am certain that 
the American side is also well aware of this: U.S. specialists 
have visited former Russian facilities for the production of 
chemical weapons. Besides, there are satellite monitoring 
systems. Incidentally, the Americans themselves, precisely in 
1987, embarked on the industrial manufacturing of binary 
weapons--the outcome of the program for modernizing their 
chemical weapons. It is precisely binary chemical weapons that 
are the hardest to control within the framework of the 
convention. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What can you say about the 
charges that new types of chemical weapons are being developed 
in Russia? Does the fact that the Novichok-5 new chemical agent 
has been developed conform to the truth? 
  Gorbovskiy: This problem falls within the 
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian 
Federation rather than our committee. Legally, not a single 
state is banned from such activities at present. This ban will 
only apply to countries that have ratified the convention once 
it takes effect. 
  It is known that research on binary chemical weapons has 
been 
conducted in many countries. The experience gained by chemical 
scientists is now being used to create international monitoring 
mechanisms. Besides, the length of time between a reaction in a 
test tube and the creation of weapons is many years or even 
decades. 
  If disclosure of information on methods for the generation 
of 
toxic substances has occurred, this is undoubtedly a dangerous 
path leading to the uncontrollable spread of chemical weapons 
and the emergence of chemical terrorism. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: The article "Poisoned 
Politics" was written by two authors--Mirzoyanov [spelling of 
name as published] and Fedorov. Nonetheless, at present only 
Mirzoyanov is on trial. What is this about? 
  Gorbovskiy: As far as I know, Mirzoyanov worked 
with secret information at the GosNIIOKhT [State Union 
Scientific-Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and 
Technology] and, naturally, signed a pledge not to divulge state 
secrets. This is why charges were filed against him. As far as 
Fedorov is concerned, he proclaims that he has never read secret 
documents anywhere nor has he signed any pledges. 
  This begs the following question: What does Fedorov stand 
for 
as a specialist? Here is the opinion of him by scientists who 
know his past activities well. 
  Lev Fedorov received his college education at the department 
of chemistry of Moscow State University while being the party 
organizer of the class, with all requisite privileges for study 
existing at the time. Subsequently, there was graduate study and 
defense of a candidate dissertation. However, some time later it 
came out that the results of his work could not be confirmed. 
His science adviser experienced major unpleasantness because of 
that. 
  The first defense of a doctoral dissertation by Fedorov 
before the Learned Council of the imeni A.N. Nesmeyanov 
Institute of Element-Organic Compounds failed for an altogether 
simple reason--plagiarism. Scientific statements which the 
author passed off as his turned out to have been borrowed from 
the works of domestic and foreign scientists. 
  Several years ago, having failed to achieve particular 
scientific success, Lev Fedorov suddenly took an intense 
interest in dioxins (organic compounds containing chlorine which 
are the byproducts of certain chemical production processes and 
pose a certain danger to humans). Lacking his own 
scientific-practical works on this issue at the time, Fedorov 
nonetheless mounted vigorous activities in this area. Mistaking 
him for a dioxin specialist, the scientific community of the 
city of Ufa invited Fedorov to participate in the development of 
the Republic Program for the Evaluation of Dioxin Contamination 
of the Natural Environment in 1992. Strangely, this specialist 
did not make any practically significant proposals, and refused 
to serve on the commission after the very first meeting. 
  Undoubtedly, incompetent people such as Lev Fedorov should 
not be commenting on an important area such as the problem of 
chemical disarmament.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Ryabov under the rubric "NOVOYE VREMYA </F>
Investigation": "`Chemical War' Against an Invisible Enemy"] 
  [Text] Scientist-chemist Vladimir Uglev has 
threatened to make public the formula of a secret chemical 
weapon. Will he end up in jail like Vil Mirzayanov? 
  The fate of Vil Mirzayanov was decided not only in the room 
of the Moscow City Court. A familiar scenario of the 1930's: 
"The sun is shining in the sky, a nightingale chirps," while in 
the cell of the Sailors' Rest prison the intellectual face of a 
scientist-chemist rubs against the stubble of hardened criminals. 
  The court that issued the ruling sending Vil Mirzayanov to 
the Sailor's Rest investigative facility is considered 
independent. As Aleksandr Asnis, the attorney for the accused, 
said, neither public appeals, of which there were plenty 
throughout last year, nor the opinion of presidential advisers 
can influence it. 
  Vil Mirzayanov met with these advisers often. In the spring 
of 1993 he talked, for instance, to Viktor Ryurikov. The latter 
felt sorry for him, was perplexed, but could do nothing. 
  Aleksandr Asnis believes that the opinions of highly placed 
people can only influence the sentence. Only Russia's General 
Procurator Aleksey Kazannik can cancel the trial. If he finds 
proof of its illegality. 
  The entire world already is talking about the court's 
illegality. Only those who are trying to legitimize it remain 
silent and hide. 
<H5>  In Bed With a Criminal </H5>
  On Sunday 30 January only one problem tormented Nuriya 
Mirzayanova: How to get a parcel with personal items and food to 
her husband in prison. Sailor's Rest is famous not only for its 
horrible conditions, but also to get a parcel in one must spend 
many hours getting permission and wait equally long in line. 
Parcels are accepted only from members of the immediate family. 
Nuriya could not go to the prison--she had a serious case of flu 
which she caught from her six-year-old son. 
  During the arrest, Vil Mirzayanov did not take anything to 
prison with him except his regular clothes. And so he stood in 
the cell wearing a regular suit and shoes, unable to change or 
warm up. Yes--stood, since seven people were in the cell with 
four beds. They had to take turns to sleep. Vil Mirzayanov had 
not have a chance to lie down for 24 hours after he had been 
brought to this "four-bed suite." 
  The scientist was arrested at noon on 27 January. In the 
evening his attorney informed the press that his client was 
locked up in Sailor's Rest. At first Vil Mirzayanov was placed 
in a large cell with many criminals. Only later was he 
transferred to a smaller cell. 
  The putschists and organizers of the "red rebellion," who 
caused a massacre in Moscow, are "resting" in respectable 
Lefortovo--the triumph of democracy. While a scientist who told 
the world of secret violations of international agreements by 
the military ended up in the category of especially dangerous 
criminals. Only military orders are carried out with such zeal. 
  Attorney Aleksandr Asnis advised Vil Mirzayanov to petition 
the court to be released from prison on the pledge that he would 
unfailingly attend all court hearings. It was because of the 
scientist's failure to appear at the Moscow City Court that he 
was thrown into the harshest investigative facility as 
punishment. 
  Nuriya Mirzayanova was certain that her husband would hold 
on 
to the end. He never succumbed to the anticonstitutional court. 
From the very beginning Vil Mirzayanov said that the trial was a 
violation of the Constitution, since the latter prohibits the 
charging of citizens on the basis of unpublished legal acts. 
<H5>  A Rare Triumph for Sensible Arguments </H5>
  The Russian Federation Committee for Chemical and 
Petrochemical Industry--the official plaintiff--accuses Vil 
Mirzayanov of disclosing state secrets in an article and 
interview published at the end of 1992 in the MOSKOVSKIYE 
NOVOSTI and NOVOYE VREMYA weeklies. 
  The prosecution considered information about the secret 
development of a new chemical weapon in Russia a state secret. 
Vil Mirzayanov did not want to accept that violations of the 
international convention banning chemical warfare would remain a 
"state secret" in his country. 
  As is known, though, no such list of secrets exists, and the 
notion itself is very vague. According to Article 15, Point 3 of 
the Russian Constitution, these published materials cannot serve 
as grounds for initiating court proceedings against Vil 
Mirzayanov. So what is he "charged" with, and so energetically 
at that? 
  An episode that is characteristic of Mirzayanov's case 
occurred in his apartment on 25 January. That evening he was 
visited by two militiamen armed with Kalashnikov rifles. They 
asked the scientist to gather his belongings, referring to the 
order of the precinct officer. They were unable to take him with 
them, though. Nuriya Mirzayanova discovered that the summons to 
the court, which was the pretext for the visit, indicated the 
time as 1030 the next morning. 
  The more senior man at first threatened to use force, but 
was 
persuaded not to do so. He spent a long time arguing on the 
phone with the precinct chief--the latter insisted that the 
order be carried out... As they left, the servant of law and 
order who disobeyed his boss was almost apologizing to the 
apartment owners. When the militia left, Vil Mirzayanov went to 
stay overnight with his daughter. 
  This is how Vil Mirzayanov fought arbitrariness, hoping for 
common sense on the part of those who were carrying out the will 
of... Who? 
<H5>  A New Character </H5>
  On 15 January the government newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
published an article signed by Igor Vlasov, member of the 
Committee on Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and 
Biological Weapons. Igor Vlasov dismissed the scientists' 
reports that chemical weapons were being developed in Russia. 
His statement was a good demonstration of the meaning of the 
word "dismissed," so categorical were Igor Vlasov's contentions. 
  The Committee on Convention-Related Problems was created by 
a 
directive of the president. It is headed by Anatoliy Kuntsevich, 
an academician and major general. Prior to this, Anatoliy 
Kuntsevich served as the commander of the chemical test site in 
Shikhany in Saratov Oblast where, as local public organizations 
maintain, chemical weapons are still being stored and tested. 
  Last year Boris Yeltsin issued a number of directives on 
procedures for carrying out the program of destruction of 
chemical weapons. In October, Anatoliy Kuntsevich and Colonel 
General Stanislav Petrov, chief of the radiation, chemical, and 
biological defense troops, visited Shikhany. Anatoliy Kuntsevich 
did not keep secret his opinion that there was no better place 
for such destruction than the Shikhany test site. 
  In December 1993 it was announced that Germany had given 
Saratov Oblast a gift of a mobile laboratory for monitoring the 
destruction of chemical weapons. 
  The incidence of eye cancer is higher in Shikhany than 
anywhere else. This indicates the strength of the effect of 
organic phosphorus accumulated there. 
  Incidences of various types of cancer are twice as high in 
this area than the all-Russia average. 
  Vladimir Uglev is a former senior researcher at an institute 
where chemical weapons were developed. The institute is located 
in Volsk, a few kilometers from Shikhany. NOVOYE VREMYA readers 
know this from an interview he gave at the beginning of 1993. 
Vladimir Uglev worked on the development and synthesis of 
chemical weapons for 15 years. He confirmed the allegations of 
Vil Mirzayanov and Lev Fedorov that Russia continues to work on 
the development of chemical weapons. 
  In February of last year the Saratov Oblast procuracy 
initiated criminal proceedings against him. For the same reason 
as the case against Vil Mirzayanov. At first, Vladimir Uglev was 
treated as a witness, but then investigator Nikolay Strilets 
decided that the chemist told too much to NOVOYE VREMYA. 
  By then the investigation in Mirzayanov's case had been 
completed and was ready to go to trial. Uglev was luckier: There 
had not been enough time to compile a dossier on him. 
  On 24 January of this year Vladimir Uglev warned that he 
would make public "formulae and names of toxic substances, the 
methods of their production and field applications" that Russia 
had not disclosed when it signed the Convention on Prohibition 
of the Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical 
Weapons and on Their Destruction. 
  Vladimir Uglev took this step in order to attract the 
president's attention to the situation in Shikhany. A new 
character had come on the scene in Moscow's "chemical war." 
<H5>  Instead, the Kerosene Was `Peddled' to Tractor Drivers </H5>
  In Vladimir Uglev's opinion, Igor Vlasov's assurances that 
"chemical conversion" is proceeding normally are a deception. 
"Before doing anything," says the member of the Committee on 
Convention-Related Problems, "we will make the public aware of 
the plans for destruction." Vladimir Uglev, however, maintains 
that the sites for chemical weapons destruction have already 
been selected. They are Shikhany and the Gornyy settlement. 
  "I am not against the destruction of toxic agents," said 
Vladimir Uglev during his meeting with the NOVOYE VREMYA 
correspondent. "But it should be done differently than is 
currently the case." 
  Vladimir Uglev is convinced that in Shikhany chemical waste 
is still being dumped into pits and chemical-weapon ammunition 
and is detonated without any measurements being performed. 
  "Three years ago they dumped a cistern of Yperite into a pit 
the same way. There was an order to burn it, but the soldiers 
decided to save kerosene. Such facts can only be proven by 
continuous monitoring. The military say that when measurements 
are done, instruments detect substances dating back quite a few 
years." 
  There are special sites for the destruction of regular 
munitions. In Shikhany, explosions are routine. As a specialist, 
Vladimir Uglev can see the actual the content of a charge: 
  "There is a thick cloud typical of toxic substances that 
floats after an explosion." 
<H5>  A-232 </H5>
  Vladimir Uglev promised to talk about the secret substance 
on 
4 February in the event his appeals to the president regarding 
the situation in Shikhany proved futile. He assured that he 
would only talk about a weapon he personally worked on, although 
he has knowledge of many secret substances. NOVOYE VREMYA was 
able to obtain brief information from Vladimir Uglev on the 
substance he worked on. 
  Specialists call it A-232. It was discovered about 20 years 
ago. Its effect is more powerful than that of the well-known VX 
nerve gas. Apparently, A-232 belongs to the class of paralyzing 
gases, since it is being compared to an agent of this class. 
  Had Vladimir Uglev revealed the A-232 formula, we would have 
learned about a hundred substances of this family. The most 
potent analogs were discovered immediately when the basic 
"skeleton" formula was invented. After that, scientists only did 
screening, trying various components to fit the basic structure. 
There are more than 10 ways of producing A-232. 
  It is easy for the military to shield A-232 from the 
convention's provisions. It consists only of combat toxic 
agents, but there is nothing to keep the Russian military from 
putting together such a classification that would make the part 
on "combat toxic agents" incomplete. 
  The command of the chemical defense troops has defined six 
types of "combat toxic agents": sarin, soman, VX, Yperite, 
lewisite, Yperite-lewisite mix, and CS. But the domestic 
classification also includes "special," "training," and 
"reserve" toxic agents. Many of them are studied as "weapons of 
foreign armies." Among them are, for instance, various toxins. 
  "Reserve" substances have special status. They are not 
classified as weapons, but may be used as such. One of 
them--phosgene--is used in the production of pesticides and dyes 
and is produced in large quantities in several Russian cities. 
In Dneprodzerzhinsk alone, 48.5 tonnes of phosgene are produced 
annually. 
  There is no guarantee that after the disclosures A-232 will 
not be classified as a "special," "training," or "reserve" toxic 
agent. 
<H5>  A Desperate Step </H5>
  On 29 January at 1100 Vladimir Uglev met with the 
president's 
national security adviser Yuriy Baturin. The keeper of the A-232 
secret was so satisfied with the conversation that he confessed 
immediately afterward that... he had not intended to make the 
secret formula public. 
  He forfeited this plan after Yuriy Baturin promised him he 
would do everything possible not only with respect to the 
Shikhany test site but also regarding Vil Mirzayanov, having 
informed him that the question of releasing the scientist from 
Sailor's Rest had been discussed "at the highest level." He 
expressed the hope that the latter would soon be leaving the 
preliminary detention facility. 
  As an afterthought, the "blackmailer" Vladimir Uglev told 
NOVOYE VREMYA a little later: 
  "I still reserve the right to name the formula if something 
happens to Vil Mirzayanov." 
  Mirzayanov himself does not share Vladimir Uglev's intent to 
threaten a disclosure of the secret substance's formula. Nuriya 
Mirzayanova also asked Vladimir Uglev to not connect his 
statement with her husband's trial under any circumstances. 
  In any case, the Moscow "chemical bomb" may not have 
exploded 
yet, but it is certainly already charged. It may explode in 
Vladimir Uglev's revelations, or in Sailor's Rest, or at the 
"highest level." Mind you, the destruction of already produced 
chemical weapons is a delicate and costly undertaking.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Tsarev and Oleg Zolotov: "The `Chemical </F>
Bomb' Is About To Explode: It Is Easier To Cope With Obstinate 
Scientists, Evidently, Than With Lethal Weapons"] 
  [Text] Last week was marked by a new scandal around the 
"Mirzayanov affair." We would remind our readers that this story 
has already been going on for more than two years. And it 
started with the fact that two doctors of chemical science--Lev 
Fedorov and Vil Mirzayanov, sincerely believing, apparently, in 
democratic changes (the affair took place soon after the failure 
of the August putsch), placed an article in one of the Moscow 
newspapers about the fact that our military is continuing to 
create and test binary chemical weapons. In a year a similar 
article by the same authors appeared in another newspaper. At 
this point the scientists were accused of divulging a state 
secret. Vil Mirzayanov was thrown into Lefortovo prison. An 
investigation began. However, under the pressure of public 
opinion the Ministry of Security nevertheless released the 
professor after 10 days... 
  Time passed. The instituted "Mirzayanov case" vanished. 
There 
was a change in the leadership of the Procuracy General, which 
filed an indictment at that time. Russia signed (one more time) 
a general agreement on chemical disarmament. A new Constitution 
was adopted. But the "Mirzayanov case," as before, is as alive 
as ever. The events of last weak confirmed this. 
  V. MIRZAYANOV: 
  "A closed session of the Moscow city court, which 
occurred in the best traditions of the past, was held on 24 
January. My lawyer declared that the case lacks a special 
purpose program of scientific research in the sphere of chemical 
weapons, the results of which I would allegedly divulge, and 
that on the grounds of Paragraph 3 of Article 15 of the Basic 
Law a citizen cannot be subjected to criminal proceedings on the 
basis of normative acts not published in the open press... We 
requested the assignment of a new examination by experts in 
which independent experts could participate, inasmuch as 
previously it was conducted by specialists of the KGB who 
represented the interests of the military-industrial complex. 
But the court declined this petition. Then I said that I do not 
have a feeling of trust in `the justice being administered,' and 
I refused to answer any further questions." 
  The action developed in the following way. On 25 January two 
militiamen appeared at the apartment of the scientist and 
ordered him to accompany them, explaining this demand by the 
need to deliver Mirzayanov to a court session scheduled for 1030 
the following day. "So, come and get me in the morning," the 
professor said. 
  The scientist was still free Thursday morning. When we 
called 
him at home, his wife--Nuriya Mirzayanova--picked up the phone. 
She said that she was a little sick and that Vil Sultanovich had 
just gone to the pharmacy for medicine... But within an hour we 
were informed that he had been arrested and sent to Sailors' 
Rest. 
  It is difficult to say at this point how this story will 
end. 
But it is already obvious that there are forces that prefer to 
contend with the scientists, who are telling the truth, but not 
with the chemical weapons. It should be recalled here that the 
first treaty in which chemical weapons were acknowledged to be 
illegal was signed as far back as the last century--in 1868. And 
it must be noted that first conference in human history to 
condemn barbaric chemical weapons was conducted specifically at 
the initiative of Russia. If the military seriously wanted to 
get rid of toxic chemical agents, chemical weapons would have 
disappeared from the face of the earth a long time ago. But, as 
before, they continue to exist, continue to be perfected, and 
are becoming more and more dangerous for humanity. 
  FROM THE CHRONICLE OF CHEMICAL WARS: 
  --1915. The Kaiser's Army employed poison gas against 
the French. Within five minutes 180 tonnes of chlorine gas were 
released from 6,000 cylinders. As a result, 15,000 French 
soldiers and officers died in terrible torment. 
  --1949. The Israeli Army employed toxic chemical agents 
against the Egyptians. 
  --1950. The United States used sarin during the war in 
Korea. 
  --1983. The Pentagon preceded the invasion of the 
island of Granada with a chemical attack. American specialists 
even photographed the excruciating death of 2,000 islanders and 
transported their bodies to the United States "for further 
research." It can be assumed that the new binary weapon was 
being tested at that time. 
  In contrast to other countries that are not ashamed of their 
achievements in the sphere of development of this barbarous 
weapon, our state tried to conduct itself more decently, 
emphasizing this in every way to world public opinion. At least 
the statement of Soviet scientists in May 1982 should be 
mentioned: "Adhering strictly to the 1925 Geneva protocol, the 
USSR has never employed chemical weapons anywhere." What was 
said generally corresponded to the truth, but it does not draw 
the entire picture. The Soviet policy of "chemical disarmament" 
had a hidden bottom... 
  --1987. M. Gorbachev declared at the UN that the USSR 
had completely stopped the production of toxic chemical agents. 
At that same time, final work was being conducted in Moscow, at 
the State Union NII [Scientific Research Institute] of Organic 
Chemistry and Technology (GSNIIOKhT), on a new chemical agent 
that surpassed the celebrated VX gas in its sinister 
characteristics. 
  --1991. M. Gorbachev, who became a Nobel laureate due 
to his peacekeeping activity, confers the Lenin Prize in the 
Kremlin on the creator of the Soviet "binary" weapon. Among the 
fathers of this terrible weapon were V. Petrunin, director of 
GSNIIOKhT, and General A. Kuntsevich, deputy chief of the 
Chemical Troops. 
  --1992. The president of the Russian Federation 
declares that Russia supports the agreement with the United 
States on the nonproduction and destruction of chemical weapons. 
But the committee working on problems of chemical weapons 
destruction that was established at that time was headed by... 
the father of the country's "binary" weapon, A. Kuntsevich. It 
is not very surprising that this same "binary" weapon was soon 
undergoing tests at the secret proving ground Ustyurt (near the 
city of Nukus). 
  Against the background of contradictory facts (plus the 
story 
about Professor Mirzayanov), talk about "total chemical 
disarmament" has to be taken with a large dose of skepticism. It 
will be recalled that not one previous international convention 
destroyed chemical weapons. On the contrary, they became even 
more lethal, increasing destructive power thousands of times. 
But as for the planned destruction of toxic chemical agents... 
From time to time in any army, tanks, aircraft, rockets... are 
written off and destroyed. For example, the dismantling and 
salvaging of general purpose munitions (mines, projectiles, 
bombs, torpedoes, etc.) is taking place in Russia as soon as 
their useful life expires. According to some data there are 1.2 
million tonnes of such combat charges at bases and in arsenals 
of the Ministry of Defense. This colossal amount of old junk has 
to be destroyed. But this occurs without any kind of 
hullabaloo--it is an operational process, nothing more. Chemical 
weapons should also be subjected to the same kind of 
destruction. Thus, why make a "worldwide show" of this? Perhaps 
behind the "smoke screen" of appeals and promises to avoid the 
fact that the weapons were to have been destroyed anyway, and it 
would be easier to conceal the true intentions? To get rid of 
the old junk and arm oneself with new toxic chemical agents that 
were not taken into account in convention documents, and so it 
is as if they were not even banned? 
  V. MIRZAYANOV: 
  "Our military generals have been ready for a chemical 
war under conditions of an international ban for a long time. 
They have conducted training at bases and in institutes and 
plants in the event of a surprise visit by international 
monitors. They have prepared the organization of the kind of 
industry in which material was always in operation that could be 
easily transformed into highly toxic chemical agents. You will 
agree: If we are developing, producing, and testing new types of 
chemical agents, but we are not including them in the list 
subject to international monitoring, then this is by no means 
being done from good motives. Rather, this is an attempt to get 
around the convention, which unquestionably contradicts the 
interests of both Russia and its citizens. After all, it is 
assumed at the same time that the other participants in the 
convention will behave in a similar way." 
  Thousands of people, including people of very high rank in 
military uniform, have been put to work on the creation, 
testing, and production of chemical weapons. Is it easy to 
renounce that which has fed you all your life? 
  Our country, which has accumulated thousands and thousands 
of 
tonnes of toxic chemical agents, did not employ them even during 
the Great Patriotic War. But these tonnes have already killed 
more than one life (not enemies--but our own people), they have 
undermined the health of many workers engaged in the production 
of poisons, they have contaminated the area around the plants, 
and they have permanently destroyed the ecology. But is it not 
simpler generally to abandon chemical weapons, even those that 
are super-modern and not yet taken into account in the last 
convention? 
  V. Mirzayanov was arrested. The trial continues. The 
decision 
will become a litmus paper that will reveal once and for all how 
serious the intentions of the Russian military are in renouncing 
chemical weapons. 
  Incidentally, the possibility of arrest now hangs over still 
another chemist--V. Uglev. He is also accused of divulging a 
"state secret." Uglev himself says: "There was nothing secret in 
the article by Mirzayanov and Fedorov, neither chemical formulae 
nor any kind of specific substances that were part of the weapon 
were indicated. However, if the authorities do not take these 
facts into account, then after the next session of the court 
(scheduled for 3 February), I will be forced to name some 
formulae..."

Resumed: Solidarity of Colleagues and Public Support Needed"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Trial </H5>
  The hearing of the case charging Vil Mirzayanov, a Russian 
chemical scientist, with divulging a state secret is supposed to 
resume today at the Moscow city court. He is charged with 
publishing an article in coauthorship with another chemist, Lev 
Fedorov, in the newspaper MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, in which he made 
public facts concerning a new type of chemical weapon--a binary 
weapon. 
  In accordance with the new Russian Constitution (Article 15, 
Paragraph 3), the list of reports containing a state secret is 
defined by federal law. Up to the present time, such a 
publication of the federal law does not exist. It is for this 
reason that on 24 January 1994 Vil Mirzayanov refused to appear 
in court voluntarily, justifying this refusal by a reluctance to 
participate in an anticonstitutional trial. 
  On the eve of the resumption of the court examination, a 
whole number of public and political organizations came out with 
statements in support of Mirzayanov. Thus, the executive 
committee of the Russia's Choice electoral association and a 
faction of the same name in the State Duma of the Russian 
Federation in a statement expressed the hope that the Moscow 
city court will in a very short time complete the examination of 
the Mirzayanov case and pronounce a verdict of not guilty. 
  Nikolay Vorontsov, chairman of the subcommittee for science 
of the Committee for Education, Culture, and Science of the 
State Duma of the Russian Federation, believes that the trial of 
the chemical scientist is an attempt to return to those times 
when a state of fear and terror reigned in society. In his 
words, the situation regarding the arrest of Vil Mirzayanov 
reminds him of 1970, when the geneticist scientist Zhores 
Medvedev was put into a psychiatric hospital in Kaluga for his 
book about Lysenko. 
  "Chemical and ecological scientists should play a big role 
in 
the current situation," thinks Nikolay Vorontsov. "If necessary, 
on their part it should come to rather tough sanctions with 
respect to the authoritative structures." 
  However, Mirzayanov's colleagues at present prefer not to 
actively advertise their attitude toward the court trial. 
Although, in the words of Nikolay Vorontsov, the president of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences Yuriy Osipov expressed his 
personal point of view and condemned Mirzayanov's prosecution. 
  "If the chemical scientists do not come out in defense of 
their colleague, I do not know whether they will be invited to 
international conferences," Mr. Vorontsov emphasized. 
  Interesting in this connection is the statement of Lev 
Fedorov that the case of his coauthor began to unravel after 
Doctor of Chemical Sciences Viktor Petrunin wrote a denunciation 
to State Security addressed to the chief of the Economic 
Security Administration. 
  But while the chemical scientists are thinking about what 
position to take in this situation, even more fundamental 
measures are being proposed. If things are called by their 
proper names, this is blackmail and threats to divulge state 
secrets. The example of Vladimir Uglev (see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
of 28 January 1994) proved to be infectious, as could be 
expected. The seed fell on fertile soil. Valeriya Novodvorskaya 
issued an ultimatum: If Vil Mirzayanov is not released by 10 
February, she will pass information to the West concerning three 
developments that constitute a state secret. It is well known 
that our country was one of the most closed. So that for more 
than 70 years quite enough secrets accumulated, and there are 
enough state secrets for everyone. But there always have been 
more than enough people in Russia who like to scratch their name 
in the annals of history with a little nail.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Zhdankin under the rubric "Weapons": "The </F>
Formula for Binary Death: The Disclosure Has Been Rescheduled"] 
  [Text] In the last issue we reported that chemical 
scientist Vladimir Uglev, one of the developers of the 
state-of-the art types of domestic chemical weapons, had 
appealed through the press (in essence, issued an ultimatum) to 
the president of Russia. The scientist promised to divulge on 4 
February "the chemical formulae and names, precursors for their 
production, and mode of combat application" of our binary 
weapons unless he was received by the president personally so 
that he could familiarize him with an "independent point of 
view" on the destruction of chemical weapons. 
  The dissident from the military-chemical complex has not 
been 
received by the president, 4 February has come and gone, but the 
world did not shudder. All the secrets except those divulged 
earlier remained in the scientist's head. 
  V. Uglev gave several reasons for his "restraint." In the 
first place, "up above," he believes, there has been a shift in 
ideas about the real problems related to the destruction of 
chemical weapons. The president's assistant for national 
security, Yuriy Baturin, met with the scientist. He agreed with 
Uglev that there are problems, and the primary one is clarifying 
the real quantities of our stockpiles. 
  Additionally, understanding the full measure of his 
responsibility, the scientist did not intend to reveal the 
secret. One of the distinctions of binary weapons from previous 
toxic substances is that the components in and of themselves 
present no great danger and are produced in immense quantities 
for peacetime purposes, and therefore it is practically 
impossible to stop up leaks. If they know the formula, in 
Uglev's words, fifth-grade chemistry students can manufacture a 
binary weapon that surpasses everything created heretofore in 
terms of its killing force. That is, the danger of uncontrolled 
spread of binary death is immense. As a person with common 
sense, the scientist did not intend to contribute to this, and 
his threat was a bluff, a means of making his way into the 
highest corridors of power. 
  The third factor is specific. Having loudly declared his 
intentions, V. Uglev expected authorized organs to pay attention 
to him. But the special services ignored him. Uglev also knows 
the formulae for the latest developments in American chemical 
weaponry, which, incidentally, do not come under the Convention 
on Bans. It is logical to assume that our former potential 
enemies have a concrete idea of our "achievements." So the state 
secret has already leaked out, and all Uglev has to do is 
divulge the formula in order for all the former imperfections of 
the special services to be blamed on him. 
  Another reason disappeared of its own accord. Uglev demanded 
the release of V. Mirzayanov from "Sailor's Rest" prison. In the 
words of lawyer A. Asnis, Mirzayanov does not intend to change 
his decisions and therefore he will not submit petitions to 
change the punishment. 
  But V. Uglev is certainly not in a good mood. He does not 
rule out the possibility of divulging information about our 
achievements. "That moment may come if we are driven into a 
corner and the leaders continue to completely ignore these 
problems." 
  The problems are indeed of an apocalyptic nature. The 
official, fairly rosy position will not stand up under 
criticism. Generals of the military-chemical complex assert that 
destroying chemical weapons is dangerous, but in Volskiy Rayon, 
where the military chemical testing ground is located, the 
incidence of oncological diseases has almost doubled in two 
years. The average indicator for Russia is less than this by a 
factor of 2.5. These figures are from the Saratov Oncological 
Center. Surpluses concealed from the world community and the 
people themselves are being destroyed hastily and barbarically. 
Last summer an outbreak of skin diseases was reported in that 
same Volskiy Rayon. The clinical picture is the same as with 
mustard gas or lewisite contamination. The military blame the 
grass cow parsnip which, according to biologists, is found 
extremely rarely in those regions. An examination of the soil in 
certain places on the test ground showed the arsenic content to 
be 330 grams per kilogram of soil. Mustard gas and lewisite 
contain arsenic. The poison is simply poured onto the soil! One 
could give a long list of examples. 
  The program for the destruction of chemical weapons 
developed 
by generals from the military-chemical complex will apparently 
have to be revised. The contradictions between the majority of 
aspects of the official viewpoint and the positions of 
independent specialists, including V. Uglev, V. Mirzayanov, L. 
Fedorov, and others, may be what Lenin would have called 
blatant. This pertains both to the quantity and the 
classification and the technologies and the cost and the safety. 
Leaders of the military-chemical complex are remaining silent, 
but this cannot last long--these problems have received too 
great a response. It will be necessary to admit many unpleasant 
things. Having begun with some kind of "trivia," the official 
picture of military-chemical socialist realism is coming apart 
at the seams. So many sad sensations lie ahead.

<F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA writer Valeriy Rudnev: "The Court </F>
Followed the State Security Path and Arrested the Scientist, But 
Refused To Pronounce a Sentence in the Vil Mirzayanov Case"] 
  [Text] Although the court's decision in the Vil 
Mirzayanov case was predictable, to be honest, it was 
unexpected. It was predictable because the ideology of 
"socialist legality" fully permitted such a concealed form of 
denial of justice. On the other hand, one does not want to 
believe that the court today can so blatantly and defiantly take 
advantage of these obsolete norms of criminal procedure. The 
more so with a case that is being followed throughout the world. 
  Understandably, a supplementary investigation is to the 
advantage of the procuracy and the investigation team in order 
to cover their tracks. But why would the court play into their 
hands? 
  IZVESTIYA has been writing about the V. Mirzayanov case 
since 
the criminal proceedings were initiated. We have discussed 
various angles of this story, which is incredible from the 
standpoint of common sense, and tried to understand the 
underlying causes of these repressive measures that have been 
taken against the scientist. We have tried to understand the 
logic of a state which, on the one hand, votes for an 
international Convention on Chemical Disarmament and, on the 
other, jails a person who has spoken out against Russia's 
"military-chemical" weapons. We have appealed to the reason of 
the investigators and procurators, proving that the scientist's 
action, regardless of how it may have displeased the 
bureaucrats, was for the good of public interests and not to 
their detriment. Alas, they would not listen to us. 
  But still there was hope in the court, a power that is 
independent of other state institutions, that is capable of 
listening to both sides and necessarily expressing an 
independent viewpoint regarding the conflict between the 
bureaucrats from the military-chemical complex and the citizen. 
Let me emphasize: The court does not have the right to refuse to 
hand down a verdict. It must say quite specifically whether the 
person is guilty or not. That is the point of the judicial 
practice. 
  According to the rules of criminal law in effect, the 
arguments of the investigators were quite adequate to put 
Mirzayanov behind bars. Were it not for one circumstance or, 
more precisely, constitutional condition: Any normative legal 
documents affecting the rights, freedoms, and obligations of a 
human being and a citizen may not be applied unless they are 
officially published for universal knowledge of them. 
  The lists of state secrets have the stamp "secret" and are 
not published anywhere. In other words, from the standpoint of 
human rights and the Constitution, it is as though the lists do 
not exist. And it is impossible to bring criminal charges 
against a person on these grounds. 
  Did the investigators from state security and the 
procurators 
supervising them know this? They knew, of course, but instead of 
human rights and the Constitution they chose a different point 
of reference--criminal law of the 1961 model which is in force, 
alas, to this day and allows references to unpublished normative 
acts. 
  Alas, the court also followed in the footsteps of state 
security and the General Procuracy. And V. Mirzayanov, who was 
trying to protest, they brought up short using a well-known 
investigatory device--they put him under guard. That is how the 
judicial investigation began. And the judicial proceedings 
rolled on along the trail that had already been blazed by the 
investigation--the person with more rights is right. 
  In the investigators' version the chemist told the world 
something that he was categorically forbidden to divulge. It was 
forbidden, naturally, by the Lists. One small thing was lacking: 
Take the Lists in hand, put V. Mirzayanov's article in front of 
them, compare the texts, and draw a conclusion--did the 
scientist really divulge a state secret? Did he say what the 
Lists had forbidden him to divulge? The entire investigation 
would take a half hour! Then they could to present the Lists and 
their conclusions to the accused and his lawyer--go ahead and 
refute them, defend yourself. 
  But no: The investigation took more than a year and was 
actually reduced to a matter making it as difficult as possible 
for the accused to exercise his right to a defense. This was 
done in a brilliantly simple way--instead of the content of the 
List itself, the contradictory opinion of experts regarding 
points of the secret document was presented. 
  What was the court supposed to do in this case? In the first 
place, as the defense anticipated, examine the text of the List 
itself and understand the nature of the disagreements among the 
experts. In the second place, if the help of specialists was 
needed, schedule a new expert appraisal but with different 
experts. The court did nothing of the kind. It followed the same 
path as the investigators--it refused to include the List in the 
criminal case and it entrusted the repeat of the expert 
appraisal to the previous specialists. 
  The result was familiar--the experts again expressed 
disagreements. And the main document on which the accusation was 
based remained outside the investigation. Now there is already a 
judicial investigation. The circle has closed: The person with 
the greatest rights is right. 
  Why did the investigation team and the court so stubbornly 
conceal the List from the accused and his defense? 
  "I think there was just one reason," answered V. 
Mirzayanov's 
defense lawyer, Aleksandr Asnis. "The paragraphs of that 
document were not convincing enough to be indisputable evidence. 
Moreover, if the List were published today, V. Mirzayanov's 
innocence would be obvious to everyone. No expert opinion would 
be necessary." 
  It is known that the procurator is not overly delighted with 
the preliminary and the judicial investigations. Apparently he 
did not manage to obtain convincing evidence of V. Mirzayanov's 
guilt. If he is not proven guilty, is he then innocent? And will 
the procurator give an acquittal? Not at all. He used a tested 
weapon of "socialist legality"--he asked the court not to 
pronounce a verdict, actually to deny the accused justice, and 
to return the case for additional investigation. 
  It is not difficult to guess the results of the 
supplementary 
investigation. Such cases as V. Mirzayanov's do not go to court 
a second time--they are "buried" in the procuracy forever. And 
regardless of the procuracy's justification for closing the 
case--whether it be because the accusation was not proved or 
because the situation changed--the decision cannot be called 
just. For if there is no judicial decision, there is no justice. 
And that is the most terrible outcome of V. Mirzayanov's 
case--to be left with the investigatory brand for his entire 
life. 
  Incidentally, V. Mirzayanov himself agreed with the 
suggestion of the state plaintiff and did not object to having 
the case sent back for further investigation. The lawyer A. 
Asnis backed his client up. Why? 
  "We had no other choice," explains the lawyer. "We chose the 
lesser of two evils. There is no point in referring to the law 
in a society where legal principles and constitutional norms are 
not enforced. Even if the procuracy has real power over the 
court, obviously, it too has to decide. After this trial, 
neither Mirzayanov nor I had any hope left of obtaining justice." 
  I do not know the arguments the court used to justify its 
decision; journalists were not informed of that. But of one 
thing I am sure--the judicial investigation conducted following 
the model and likeness of the state security investigation did 
not add to its glory and did not lead to the truth. And I am 
afraid that the judges in these scandalous proceedings were 
quite suited to the typical position of bureaucrats of some 
"legal protection department" who actually act and make 
decisions in deference to their more influential colleagues--the 
procurators and investigators. 
  So for now let us not foster any hopes in that beautiful 
slogan about the separation of powers. Judging from the case of 
Vil Mirzayanov, it seems that we have only one 
power--military-chemical.

  [Text] The case of chemist Mirzayanov accused of divulging 
state secrets concerning the development of chemical weapons is 
taking a new turn. In particular Valeriya Novodvorskaya has 
issued the following statement to the POSTFACTUM agency: 
"Inasmuch as the Russian president has found the time to 
express his distress over the tribulations of our hockey team at 
the Olympics and even telephoned personally to Norway while 
being unable to find either the time or the inclination to give 
an opinion on Vil Mirzayanov's imprisonment, on 21 February I 
sent two Western powers three secret studies of a strategic 
nature. That is I have done something which comes under article 
65 of the Russian Federation criminal code -- `espionage.'" 
  In addition V. Novodvorskaya said that unless Vil Mirzayanov 
is released by 10 March she will hand over the formula for a 
Russian binary weapon (over which all the trouble started) to a 
European Community state. Let us note that the chemist V. Uglev 
also intended to make this secret public. 
  Russian General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik yesterday 
repealed the preventive restriction measure chosen by the course 
for detaining Vil Mirzayanov. Now he must be released 
immediately on the undertaking that he does not change his 
address.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of </F>
Russian Armed Forces General Staff, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given: "Col. Gen. Mikhail 
Kolesnikov: Russia Does Not Produce Chemical Weapons" -- first 
two paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Articles and speeches by private individuals are 
continuing to appear in the press and on television in which 
attempts are made to bring to the notice of Russia's population 
and the world public distorted information about Russia's 
compliance with the demands of international agreements in the 
sphere of banning chemical weapons and about the Defense 
Ministry's activity relating to questions of preparations to 
destroy these weapons. 
  At the editorial office's request the chief of the Russian 
Armed Forces General Staff dots the "i's" in this matter. 
  Kolesnikov: Production of chemical weapons in the 
former USSR was stopped in 1987 and has never been resumed, and 
their stocks have not been replenished or renewed. The stocks 
of chemical weapons in the Russian Federation Armed Forces do 
not exceed 40,000 tonnes by weight of toxins and are located on 
the Russian Federation's territory in seven specially equipped 
arsenals which make it possible to ensure their safe and 
reliable storage. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: Is it proposed to destroy the 
existing stocks? 
  Kolesnikov: In accordance with a decision of the 
Russian Government, the Ministry of Defense is currently 
preparing the necessary grounds for a Russian chemical weapons 
destruction program. The Defense Ministry is also the state 
customer for work on creating ecologically safe technologies for 
destroying (recycling) chemical weapons. At the same time it 
uses in its work the principles of glasnost in choosing the 
necessary technologies and discusses together with the regions' 
representatives the sections of the draft program, the project 
documentation, and other substantiating documents which concern 
them. It actively promotes coverage in the mass media and in 
scientific publications of various aspects of the problem of the 
destruction of chemical weapons. The time for adopting "quiet" 
decisions is long gone. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: How is it proposed to implement 
this program which, without exaggeration, is unprecedented? 
Will the destruction of stocks of chemical weapons not affect 
people's health and the ecology? 
  Kolesnikov: The destruction of chemical weapons 
will be carried out in the Russian Federation only at 
installations specially created for these purposes, and their 
location will be decided by a government commission. It has 
been formed in accordance with the Russian president's directive 
of 9 August 1993. The basic condition in preparing for 
destruction is to ensure the safety of the population and the 
environment. To these ends the Defense Ministry cooperates 
closely with oblast and republic inspection organs in monitoring 
the population's health and taking samples of objects in the 
environment. Such work has already been carried out in the 
region of Kambarka city in the Udmurt Republic and in Saratov 
Oblast's Krasnopartizanskiy Rayon (Gornyy settlement) and 
Volskiy Rayon (Shikany settlement). Top-class medical 
specialists, professionals in their own line, are involved in 
carrying it out. The results of the assessment of the state of 
health are reported to the regions where this work is carried 
out. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: Everything is clear, you might 
think. The Defense Ministry makes no secret of the large-scale 
measure that is being prepared and is ready to pass information 
to the interested persons. Nevertheless, fabricated articles 
which inflame the atmosphere in society are continuing to 
appear. How do you rate them? 
  Kolesnikov: In this connection the Defense 
Ministry deems it necessary to declare that the use of 
information relating to military-chemical potential and to the 
Russian Federation's fulfillment of its pledges under 
international treaties in the sphere of banning chemical weapons 
must be based exclusively on official sources. The opinions of 
private individuals may not serve as a basis for assessing 
Russia's activity in the said sphere. The incompetence and 
unreliability of the sources of information are inflaming the 
situation in places where stocks of chemical weapons are stored 
and where the military units dealing with the problem of 
destroying chemical weapons are stationed, and they are helping 
to shape a distorted and false public understanding of the real 
state of affairs in respect of Russia's desire to eliminate 
chemical weapons stocks. All this can be regarded as blackmail 
for the purpose of vilifying Russia's methods of preparing to 
destroy chemical weapons and damaging our country's political 
authority. 
  For everyone who makes such statements and for those who 
disseminate them among the public it is time to ponder the 
question: Whom does this benefit?

Oblast by I. Deryugin and Ye. Gerasimenko, identified by

  [Text] [202502] Echoes of the press scandal and legal 
proceedings concerning chemical weapons which have taken place 
in the capital can be heard also in our region, especially since 
one of this sector's main facilities is located right here. I 
am referring to Shikhany. The veil of secrecy shrouding the 
local military test range and two institutes involved in the 
development of chemical weapons in the past has been slightly 
lifted. 
  However, this does not mean that fewer questions are now 
being asked among either the local population or the military 
themselves as regards the range of problems concerning chemical 
weapons. Reports about alleged flareups of skin diseases and 
other allergies, attributed to the proximity of the dangerous 
chemical facility, which periodically appear in the local press 
are rebutted by the military. However, an independent expert 
medical and ecological study is constantly being put off. And 
where should the money for such a study come from when there are 
no funds even for maintaining the GITOS [as heard, expansion 
unknown], the Shikhany institute which used to develop chemical 
weapons in the past and has been devising techniques for their 
destruction in recent years. As from the beginning of February 
the institute staff have been sent on indefinite, unpaid 
vacation. 
  The absence of a clear state program for the destruction of 
chemical weapons and the uncertainty about the Shikhany 
facilities' participation in this process cannot but spawn new 
rumors and add tension to the situation. [202614] [video shows

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Chemical Weapons Threaten Volga </F>
Region. Deadline for Their Destruction May Not Be Met"] 
  [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Around now a terminal was to have 
been built on the banks of the Volga in Saratov Oblast to strip 
out [peretarivaniye] chemical agents from their containers 
[yemkosti] and subsequently detoxify them. That at least is 
what the draft first stage of the state program for the 
destruction of chemical weapons envisages. However, local 
residents, worried by leaks at stores that have been here a long 
time, have sounded the alarm and are objecting to new 
installations with this kind of specialism. 
  Russia's president signed the Paris Convention on the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons a year ago, in January 1993. 
According to the Convention, the first installation for the 
destruction of chemical agents must be tested within two years 
at most. Half this time has already elapsed and Russia still 
has no laws, no concept, no approved state program for chemical 
weapons destruction. Meanwhile leaks of poisonous substances 
from containers that have eroded have been recorded at the 
arsenal sited on the territory of Saratov Oblast. 
  The village of Gornyy, where 690 tonnes of mustard gas, 225 
tonnes of lewisite, and 210 tonnes of their compounds are 
stored, is not far from the Volga. The chemical weapons that 
have been here for ages, packed in metal barrels and railroad 
tankers, pose a potential danger. 
  The strength of the harmful chemicals will be reduced by a 
factor of 1,000-10,000 when the chemical agents are stripped out 
at the new terminal. The plan is to reprocess the reactive 
matter obtained in Shikhany, 100 km from Gornyy, where the 
top-secret State Institute of Organic Synthesis Technology 
[SIOST], which developed chemical weapons in the recent past, is 
located. 
  Doctor of Sciences Aleksandr Kochergin, the institute's 
director, said that several technologies have been developed for 
the destruction of the stocks from the arsenal in Gornyy. 
Whereas the situation is clear with regard to the mustard gas, 
a choice has not yet been made with regard to the lewisite and 
its compounds. In the opinion of SIOST scientists, the most 
preferable option is for this kind of chemical agent to be 
recycled [utilizatsiya] since it contains costly arsenic used in 
microelectronics, laser technology, optics, and pharmaceuticals. 
In other words, the recycling technology presupposes not only 
expenditure on chemical weapons destruction but also 
considerable income from the reprocessing of chemical agents 
into particularly pure arsenic, which Russia does not currently 
produce. 
  This technology can also be used to recycle 
arsenic-containing adamsite -- an irritant chemical agent 
produced early this century, which has been shipped to Shikhany 
from throughout the former Union -- of which more than 8,000 
tonnes have been buried straight in the ground at the testing 
range of the military institute next to SIOST. The huge Russian 
adamsite dump is a source of great worry not only to the public 
but also to scientists, who are voicing misgivings over the 
possible environmental contamination from these stocks. 
  It may seem to the uninitiated that there are no particular 
problems with the destruction of the Saratov arsenal. It is 
only the choice of technology and the construction of a terminal 
and recycling installations that are holding things up. 
However, one must not forget that we are talking about chemical 
weapons, which are to be destroyed in densely populated areas 
right next to the Volga. This is a very sensitive subject for 
the residents of the area since the environmental background 
here is unfavorable enough as it is. In the city of Volsk, for 
instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow 
flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times 
in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to 
three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which 
contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process. 
People's disquiet is intensified by the constant rumors about 
the danger of radiological contamination of the area from the 
Balakovo nuclear electric power station 50 km from Volsk. Add to 
that atmospheric discharges by Balakovo's big chemical giants 
and you will understand the public concern, which is threatening 
to develop into an organized protest against the siting of 
chemical weapons destruction facilities bin these areas. 
  This disquiet is intensified by conjecture and speculation 
due to the utter secrecy surrounding the facilities at Shikhany. 
I visited them, spoke with scientists, and saw that there is no 
intention of building any more production units here, the former 
technology used for the synthesis of chemical agents has merely 
been reversed. According to the findings of a special 
environmental and medical monitoring laboratory, the air in 
Shikhany is considerably cleaner than in Volsk, people live 
longer and have fewer illnesses. 
  Choosing the technology is only part of the problem and by 
no 
means the most important part. Social and environmental 
questions are the main thing. Mikhail Yakovlev, Saratov Oblast 
Administration department head, briefed me on a Russian 
Government draft decree that the residents of the oblast have 
prepared on their own initiative. It enshrines their immediate 
demands without whose fulfillment the chemical weapons 
destruction process cannot be started. During the first quarter 
of this year the Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical 
and Biological Weapons under the Russian President and the 
Ministry of Defense, in conjunction with other departments, are 
asked to define a concept, prepare drafts of a basic law and a 
number of other legislative acts designed to form the legal base 
for the practical implementation of the Paris Convention, and 
guarantee safety, health, and social protection. According to 
civilized norms, the facilities for the storage and destruction 
of chemical weapons and the population centers around them 
should be given special status with all the concomitant 
guarantees, as is the case in the United States for instance. 
  The demand for regular environmental and medical monitoring 
is also natural. During the first stage, before the 
experimental installations begin work, the intention is to study 
the state of the environment and carry out a comprehensive 
screening process involving residents in Volskiy and 
Krasnopartizanskiy Rayons, which include Shikhany and Gornyy, in 
order to determine the consequences of the storage and testing 
of chemical weapons on the environment and the population's 
health. 
  The importance of the social and environmental aspects can 
be 
judged from the funding structure, where expenditure on 
monitoring and the social everyday sphere in Shikhany, Volsk, 
and Gornyy amounts to 67 billion rubles [R] of the R72 billion 
that the oblast administration deems it necessary to allocate 
for the entire first phase of the program, a phase culminating 
in the construction and testing of the experimental-industrial 
facility for the destruction and recycling of chemical agents 
and the creation of the requisite support infrastructure. 
  Nadezhda Saratovtseva, head of administration of the 
settlement of Shikhany, has a better knowledge of the whole set 
of problems than anyone else. She takes part without fail in 
all the meetings and talks on this topic and has even addressed 
parliamentary hearings. 
  "The state program for the destruction of chemical weapons 
has been in the process of being written and draft laws have 
been in the process of being harmonized since 1989," she said. 
"Presidents, governments, and parliaments have come and gone, 
but still there are no laws and no program. There is no concept 
and no funding. The SIOST has not been paid for three months 
and that unique institution is on the verge of stoppages. The 
social sphere -- the burden of which is borne entirely by the 
institute -- is going to pieces." 
  Judging by the center's unhurried approach, one can 
confidently assume today that the schedule proposed by the 
Saratov administration in its draft government decree will also 
be disrupted. 
  "You produced the chemical weapons, you destroy them," 
Saratovtseva was told by one highly-placed Moscow official. 
  Meanwhile the chemical bomb planted almost on the very banks 
of the Volga may spring its surprise at any minute. In that 
case it would not only be the residents of Saratov on the Volga 
who would suffer.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Tarasov report: "Siberian Military Plants on the </F>
Brink of Upheavals. There Is No Money and No Work"] 
  [Text] Krasnoyarsk -- The situation in the 
military-industrial complex' Siberian domains is becoming 
explosive: The many-thousands-strong collective of one of thje 
biggest production facilities in the Russian defense industry -- 
the Krasnoyarsk Machine Building Plant, a state enterprise upon 
which an order has been conferred -- is in a state of turmoil. 
The missile builders are taking a tough stand and demanding 
money and work. 
  On the last working day of last week around 500 people 
"besieged" the plant's management, and by evening practically 
the entire shift at the Krasnoyarsk Machinebuilding Plant was 
participating in an emergency meeting. General Director V. 
Gupalov was taken to hospital for intensive care, suffering from 
an attack of angina pectoris. The disturbances spilled over 
from the territory of the secret plant onto the streets; workers 
went off to see the governor in search of the truth, threatening 
to blockade the kray administration building and seal off the 
roads if he did not help immediately. 
  There was another meeting on Monday where, as the "Krasmash" 
directors informed IZVESTIYA, the collective by and large agreed 
with the proposals made by the plant's leadership for 
stabilizing the situation. Gupalov flew to Moscow. It has been 
said that the government has allocated money. But this money 
has not appeared yet. So a new outburst of passions may occur 
at any moment. 
  "Krasmash's" customer -- the Ministry of Defense -- has 
failed to pay the missile manufacturers 11.3 billion rubles [R] 
for the state order carried out last year. Wages have not been 
paid for four months, and there is no money for the absolute 
essentials. 
  Technical Director L. Kovrigin told IZVESTIYA that the plant 
leadership has appealed to the president, the premier, the 
Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Finance. At the end of 
December V. Chernomyrdin gave instructions for the debts to be 
paid off during January. Security Council Secretary O. Lobov 
reported that the president wrote the following resolution on 
the appeal from the missile manufacturers: For immediate and 
strict implementation. Nevertheless, the plant has not received 
the money. 
  The director's order on the closure of the assembly shops as 
of 15 February for six weeks -- as it stands at the moment -- 
has added fuel to the flames. Those who have not taken 
enforced leave will work three days a week (until now the plant 
has had a four-day week). The point is that in recent years, 
the Ministry of Finance has not only not been in a hurry to 
settle its accounts, but even to conclude contracts with the 
plant. Under the law on the state order, "Krasmash" should 
obtain a contract two years before the manufacturing deadline, 
since the cycle of manufacture of the articles takes up more 
than one year. The plant was meant to have been given an 
advance by 1 February for the purchase of vital materials. The 
contract has still not been signed and the money has not been 
transferred. This practice has become the norm. Others would 
doubtless interpret it as the fact that their services are no 
longer needed. But "Krasmash" has continued to selflessly forge 
the motherland's missile shield. The conversion of the leading 
brains in the military-industrial complex is a very difficult 
matter. Judging by his behavior, which is not consonant with 
the economic situation, the general director is continuing to be 
more worried about the Russian defense capability than about the 
fate of the labor collective entrusted to him. The director has 
remained a general, but has not become an entrepreneur. Which 
may be pleasant to the state, but not to the workers, the 
reserves of whose selfless devotion have run dry. 
  At the moment it is the local authorities who are settling 
up 
for the debts to the military-industrial complex. Governor V. 
Zubov has allocated 1 billion to the machine builders. This will 
be enough to pay October's wages and part of November's. The 
missile builders have received assistance from the budget by 
dint of their strength, although the situation of other groups 
in the population is scarcely much better. Workers in high 
schools, colleges, and universities are in a state of combat 
readiness for mass protest actions. The list of enterprises in 
the kray which have come to a standstill or are working at 
half-strength is breath-taking. The ship-building plant has 
just stopped carrying out the military order, and its workers 
have been sent off on a three-week vacation. The trade union 
committee has of course put forward some demands... The 
professional guardians of the people are increasingly feeling 
that they are "in their element." The unforgettable appeal to 
the proletariat to unite is in use again. Communists are 
proposing to extend the spheres of influence of the strike 
committees, and the executive committee of the "Trudovoye 
Krasnoyarye" movement is appealing for the formation of a united 
city strike committee. 
  The revolt at "Krasmash" has been brewing for a long time 
and 
seems to be entirely natural. At one time the empire of the 
missile builders had been divided into six plants, and in a 
single year of their free existence, matters took an upward turn 
for capable people. But in 1992, under pressure from the 
Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Industry, the State 
Committee for the Management of State Property scorned the laws, 
the opinion of the labor collectives, and economic expediency, 
and drove five plants into the stable of the military-industrial 
complex once again, thereby placing them under a single boss. 
Having glued together an unviable monster, the state has not 
nevertheless even determined whether it needs "the most 
important strategic output," on whose production "Krasmash" has 
the monopoly. No money is being found to pay for it. Well, if 
even the instructions of the president and the prime minister 
are not being carried out, should the basic production be carved 
up for scrap? After all, in principle it cannot respecialize. 
Or does Russia still need ballistic missiles for submarines and 
other complex military output? Why does the state allow chiefs 
of shops and workers and officials at local level to be 
tormented by these questions? 
  In the past we use to be called Upper Volta with missiles. I 
don't know about the Volta bit, although I suppose there is a 
similarity, but all the indications are that it may be tough as 
regards the missiles.

  [Text] Petr Deinekin, Commander of the Russian Air Force, 
told Interfax Tuesday that all aircraft of the strategic nuclear 
force had been moved from Kazakhstan to Russia. 
  In his words, the last four Tu-95 MS of the 79th heavy 
bomber 
division, stationed near Semipalatinsk, had been withdrawn from 
Kazakhstan to Russia on his orders on February 19. 
  He said that a total of 40 Tu-95 MS's had once been 
stationed 
in Kazakhstan. They have been moved into Russia which is the 
successor of the Soviet Union as far as nuclear forces are 
concerned. "The withdrawal of heavy bombers, as they are 
referred to in the treaty even though they are strategic rocket 
carrying aircraft, from Kazakhstan into Russia was consistent 
with START I because this was done within the former Soviet 
Union," Deinekin said. 
  Several obsolete Tu-95 bombers that still stay in 
Semipalatinsk airfield were manufactured in 1955 and pose no 
threat because Kazakhstan does not possess rockets of nuclear 
warheads for this type of bombers, he said. 
  He mad it clear that Kazakhstan lacked the capability to 
assure safe storage of nuclear warheads or to keep strategic 
aircraft operational. "As a professional I am confident that 
outside Russia none of the CIS member nations can keep the air 
force component of the strategic nuclear forces operational 
because this requires large spending, very high skills and aid 
from design boards and manufacturing industries," he explained. 
  Of all these countries only Ukraine possesses strategically 
important aircraft. In particular, there are 20 Tu-95 bombers 
in Uzin, 50 km away from Kiev, and 20 Tu-160 aircraft in 
Priluki, Chernigov Region, Deinekin said. He added that only a 
few of them were capable of taking off. 
  Deinekin said that talks were underway with the Ukrainian 
armed forces on withdrawal of these aircraft into Russia "but we 
have not come to a full understanding."

  [Text] Commander of the Russian long-range nuclear weapons 
Gen. Igor Sergeyev says Moscow is no longer in control of the 
safety of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. 
  In an interview with Interfax on Tuesday, he said that the 
missile troops deployed in Ukraine were no longer under Moscow's 
control after the commanders of the 43rd and 46th missile 
divisions took an oath of allegiance to Kiev. 
  Sergeyev spoke of being unable to control troops "whose 
officers expressed loyalty to another state." He said he 
outlined the emerging situation in letters to Ukrainian and 
Russian Defence Ministers Vitaliy Radetskyy and Pavel Grachev. 
  At the same time, the Russian official pointed to progress 
in 
the negotiations on the pullout of nuclear weapons from Ukraine. 
He said the first batch of nuclear weapons was to be 
transferred to Russia on March 28. 
  Sergeyev said that tension was also running high over the 
nuclear weapons deployed in Kazakhstan whose leadership 
prevented the transfer of weapons to Russia and opposed the plan 
for taking obsolete missiles off combat duty. Sergeyev says the 
dismantling of those missiles should have been started in 1993 
but nothing has so far happened. 
  In his words, Moscow has no problems with the servicing or 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons deployed in Belarus. "These have 
remained under our jurisdiction," said the general. He also 
said that one of the three missile divisions deployed in Belarus 
had been pulled out and disbanded as scheduled. 
  The two remaining divisions are to be withdrawn and 
demobilized in the first half of 1996. Sergeyev says the 
withdrawal process will taken in stages: four regiments will be 
withdrawn in 1994 and the other four a year later. This will 
bring an end to the pullout of nuclear weapons from Belarus. 
The two divisions are to be disbanded in the first half of 1996. 
  Sergeyev says that his troops' combat readiness is just as 
high as in the period of stagnation in the former Soviet Union 
when military supplies were good. In his words, the withdrawal 
of obsolete missiles were being carried out as scheduled.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Galkin; from the "Voskresenye" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Baykonur cosmodrome. It was the place where the 
history of Russia's military space forces started in 1955, 
though they developed into an independent structure much later, 
at the beginning of the 1980's. The jurisdiction of the 
military space forces, if one can call it that, covers the 
cosmodromes of Baykonur, in Kazakhstan, and Plesetsk, which is 
in the Arkhangelsk oblast, as well as the main center of the 
control and telemetry complex in Golitsino in the Moscow 
countryside, and the tracking stations situated across the 
country from the western borders to Kamchatka. 
  [Begin recording] Valeriy Grin, chief of the 
headquarters of the main center of the control and telemetry 
complex: It is our duty to ensure that our military and 
political leadership is warned of the preparation for a possible 
aggression or war by -- well, it is not the fashion now to call 
them a probable enemy, but that does not matter, it is our duty 
to do this. 
  Galkin: Well, the spy satellites, are they your 
business? 
  Grin: It is the the state's duty to ensure its 
security, including by means of intelligence work in all 
spheres, both on the ground and in the air, and in space as well. 
  Galkin: So you manage these spheres [words 
indistinct] as well? 
  Grin: Like any other power. Look at the United 
States, and certainly China. 
  Galkin: One can speak about this openly now. All 
the space launches, from the first sputnik to the international 
teams, were done by the military. I remember with shame how we 
made the officers and soldiers change their clothes because of 
the censorship. How whole episodes were cut out of programs if 
a service cap was glimpsed in the background. And that was at a 
time when all the world knew that the military were 
participating in the Soviet space programs. Today the military 
space forces have dropped the masquerade, thank God. But by no 
means does this mean that there are no longer any real secrets 
here. Of course there are, and as usual they are being well 
guarded. 
  The highest qualifications are needed to manage space. One 
cannot achieve them in one or two years. That is one of the 
main problems of the military space forces today. According to 
the present rules officers are transferred to the reserve the 
same as in line units, at the age of 45-50. But a 
mathematician, a ballistics expert, or a programmer is at the 
height of his professional skill at that age. How can this 
unique system, which so far acknowledges no state borders and is 
resistant to any hindrance except a political one, be preserved? 
The staff problems are, of course, a difficult thing, but they 
can, one hopes, can be surmounted. The cutting of funding for 
space programs, however, is already being felt in carrying out 
economic and military tasks. Unfortunately, our history is full 
of cases where small economies led us to lose on important 
things later. Space systems should not become hostage to the 
ruble and society's disdainful attitude to them. 
  Galkin: Which arms of service will be the first to 
disappear in the future and which ones will remain to the end, 
so to speak? 
  Grin: Well, I find it difficult to say which ones 
will disappear first, but I know that military space forces will 
remain to the end. [end recording] 
  Galkin: Yes, times have changed. We have stopped 
viewing the world through a vision slit. We are viewed now 
without the previous suspicion. But it is premature and even 
dangerous to say that there is no need for the army. [Video 
shows view of Baykonur, scenes of servicemen working with 
electronic equipment in the control center, Grin talking to the 
correspondent in room, launching pads, rockets being launched, 
radars, satellites in orbit, a military parade]

<F P=106> [Report by Yuryy Alyakseyew: "There Should Be Peace in the </F>
World"] 
  [Text] The Belarusian Committee for Solidarity With Serbs 
and Montenegrins [BKSSCh] has sent a letter to Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb and Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, in 
which it appeals to "defend our Serbian brothers." "At the time 
when the Slavic civilization is on the verge of physical 
termination," says the letter, "we propose to take the following 
steps: To establish diplomatic relations with the Federative 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]; to temporarily provide complex 
assistance for the FRY; to denounce any sanctions against our 
brothers; to reexamine the issue of Belarus' nonnuclear status 
as contradictory to national security of the entire Slavic 
world; and to secede from the Treaty on Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons." 
  The BKSSCh has also issued a statement supporting the 
position of the Belarusian Prime Minister V. Kebich that 
indicates that "air raids in Yugoslavia can divide not only 
Europe but also the entire world." "Therefore," the statements 
notes, "the problems in Yugoslavia should be resolved by 
peaceful means."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
  Speaking about cuts in the Belarusian offensive weapons, 
[Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav] Kebich said that if 
Belarus was not given financial assistance in disarmament, it 
would not be able to eliminate tanks and aircraft at the old 
rate according to international agreements. He said that 
Belarus bore all of the related expenses on its own. 
  The economic problems complicate the financing of the 
disarmament program, said Kebich. He also pointed out that 
Belarus was honestly and consistently implementing its 
commitments to cut down armaments and would continue to do so in 
the future.

  [Text] Russia and Kazakhstan intend to continue bilateral 
talks on a military cooperation and use of Baykonur space 
launching station treaty. 
  A high ranking official of the Russian Space Agency (RSA) 
told Interfax that "members of the Russian state commission 
under RSA Director General Yuriy Koptev must leave for Almaty on 
March 1." He emphasized that "the drafts that were submitted by 
the Russian negotiators in Moscow at the end of January have 
been agreed on, only minor points have to be clarified." 
  In his view, the Almaty meeting "is likely to finalize 
documents that will be signed by the presidents of the two 
countries in a near future." 
  Baykonur, the largest space launching station of the former 
USSR and the world, became Kazakhstan's property when the 
republic won independent in October 1991. All its launching 
pads are still manned by the Russian Space Force which, in the 
words of Koptev, "wants to continue operating Baykonur for at 
least 15 to 20 years more." 
  Experts say that most Russian space missions cannot be 
launched elsewhere. What is more, Russia has commitments to 
joint programs, in particular with the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration of the U.S.A. it has signed a $400 Mn 
contract on construction of an international orbital station and 
commercial launches of western satellites by Russian Proton 
boosters which can be launched only from Baykonur pads.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Nuclear Magazines in Kazakhstan </F>
Are on the Verge of an Accident"] 
  [Text] While Kiev and Moscow are reaching agreement on the 
fate of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, a critical situation has 
taken shape in the nuclear magazines located on the territory of 
Kazakhstan. IZVESTIYA has been told this by informed sources at 
the Russian Ministry of Defense. 
  As is known, 104 SS-18 missiles -- the heaviest in the world 
-- each with 10 nuclear warheads, and also Tu-95MS strategic 
bombers with 240 cruise missiles with a nuclear payload are 
stationed in that state. The situation on the nuclear technical 
bases where these specialized munitions are stored is becoming 
threatening. Particularly in the garrisons at Derzhavinsk in 
Turgay Oblast and at Zhangiz-Tobe in Semipalatinsk Oblast, where 
two missile divisions are stationed. 
  The number of nuclear munitions laid in store [are] more 
than 
twice the permissible norms. The fire alarm system, the fire 
extinguishing equipment, and the electric wiring are literally 
on their last legs and virtually do not work. If, God forbid, 
some untoward situation were to arise, it would be problematic 
to get the nuclear warheads out of the building and also to 
extinguish the flames -- the consequences do not bear thinking 
about. Things are no better in the shop in which operational 
checks on the reentry vehicles of strategic missiles are carried 
out. For several months now it has been in a precarious 
[avariynyy] state. The end wall has come away from the 
building, and if it collapses it will bury beneath itself both 
nuclear warheads and people. 
  I was told that there is no heating or water in the special 
premises of the missile technical bases. The technical 
contrivances for guarding these bases, the engineered structures 
-- or more accurately, the wire entanglements -- and the 
protection device along which high-tension current passes have 
been disconnected from the power supply network, and the mine 
fields and signal rockets are not activated when the perimeters 
of the guarded sectors are violated by wild animals and people. 
The guard subunits are not fully manned, and their training is 
at such a low level that you can only be amazed that no one has 
yet stolen a single atom bomb. Maybe this is only because it is 
so cold now in the steppes of Northern Kazakhstan and criminals 
do not feel like going after nuclear secrets. 
  There is, in principle, just one reason for all these 
disgraceful things, which specialists call by the abstruse term 
"gross violation of the explosion-and-fire-safety requirements" 
-- the lack of an interstate agreement between Russia and 
Kazakhstan on the status of, and on the future fate of, the 
missile technical bases and the strategic missile troops 
stationed on the state's territory. 
  Although Almaty does not consider itself the owner of these 
specific weapons and has announced that the state has subscribed 
to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a 
country which does not possess them, according to information 
from the same source, its officials prohibit the Russian 
military from taking them outside the republic to manufacturing 
plants and, moreover, do not permit the delivery to the 
garrisons of the necessary spare parts and tools or the 
equipment for carrying out repair work or the warranty servicing 
of nuclear munitions. 
  The national bank of Kazakhstan does not have a ruble 
account 
to which Russia could transfer money to pay for the labor of its 
officers and ensigns or allocate funds for electricity or to 
ensure the garrisons' vital activity. 
  Owing to chronic nonpayments, the missilemen regularly have 
their electricity cut off, and this, so specialists say, could 
result in the unpredictable behavior of the entire nuclear 
missile complex. 
  "Things have reached the point," one of the officers who 
have 
arrived from Kazakhstan told me, "where our pay is smuggled over 
the border to us." 
  But there is nothing to buy in the garrison stores even with 
the money that the officers do get -- they are completely empty. 
The mood among officers could not be worse. Virtually over 
half the nuclear specialists with top qualifications do not wish 
to sign contracts for military service here. Deserters have 
even appeared among officers, and 14 recent graduates of higher 
military schools went absent without leave from one of the 
divisions and have not turned up for service for several months 
now. Four of them are specialists on nuclear warheads. 
  According to the information which the editorial office has, 
repeated requests from the leadership of the Russian Ministry of 
Defense to Kazakhstani Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko to 
help to organize the normal functioning of the nuclear missile 
installations located in the country have not produced any 
results. Written requests have not even been answered. Maybe 
the visit to Almaty of Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will get 
something moving. But the military is afraid that this process 
might drag on indefinitely. Nuclear weapons cannot wait 
endlessly.

  [Excerpts] State adviser Tulegen Zhukeyev described as 
absolutely untrue to fact, the story: Nuclear magazines in 
Kazakhstan are on the brink of an accident, published by 
IZVESTIYA on 12 February. At a news conference it was said 
that: This publication is very likely to have been ordered and 
inspired by those who are interested in introducing additional 
complications into the negotiations that are likely to be 
started between the two states on the issues of nuclear weapons, 
and a search for mutually acceptable decisions on a parity 
basis, taking into account mutual benefits. 
  Zhukeyev voiced the opinion that the Russian military and 
industrial complex can be such a party, because it aims at 
enhancing its influence on the elaboration of the policy in the 
corridors of power of the Russian Federation and wants to take 
upon itself individual decision-making, though it has succeeded 
in this too much already. It practically has disavowed the 
agreement between the CIS nuclear states about mutual control 
over nuclear stocks, and the strategic designation troops are 
completely under the Russian military leadership's command. The 
state adviser said further: Probably, the fact that Kazakhstan 
has suspended the export of intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
which has been done entirely through Kazakhstan's own goodwill, 
is causing this displeasure among certain forces. [passage 
omitted] 
  Zhukeyev said: It makes us think that the Russian military 
and industrial complex is counting on the possibility that the 
world community would apply additional pressure on Kazakhstan in 
connection with the nuclear weapons problem. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Almaty February 25 TASS -- Kazakhstan fully observes 
its international obligations, U.S. military inspectors told a 
news conference here today after visiting the Petropavlovsk 
heavy machine-building plant. The plant used to produce 
launchers for medium- and shorter-range missiles. 
  The inspection was made within the framework of the Treaty 
on 
Medium- and Shorter-Range Missiles joined by Kazakhstan after 
disintegration of the former Soviet Union. The republic has a 
quota on sending its inspectors to the United States and an 
obligation to admit U.S. representatives to Kazakh facilities 
liable for inspection. 
  The inspection was the first of the sort in sovereign 
Kazakhstan. It was held in an atmosphere of cooperation and 
mutual respect thanks to the correct stand of the Kazakh Defence 
Ministry's accompanying team on treaty obligations, said the 
Americans. 
  The experts are sure Kazakhstan will continue to fully 
observe its military obligations.

  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS -- Ukraine has no 
possibility to fully service nuclear weapons, Col.-Gen. Ivan 
Bizhan, deputy defense minister of Ukraine, told ITAR-TASS today. 
  According to the Ukrainian commander who is participating in 
a two-day meeting of the Council of Defense Ministers of the 
Commonwealth countries in Moscow, "Russia has assumed an 
obligation to carry out a guarantee and author's supervision 
over nuclear weapons on the Ukrainian territory, and all 
conditions are being created here for Russian specialists to 
service nuclear objects." 
  Commenting on the report by a representative of the Russian 
Defense Ministry on the impossibility to service nuclear objects 
on the Ukrainian territory, Ivan Bizhan noted that "there are 
separate structures in Ukraine which do not like the normal 
course of resolving Russo-Ukrainian problems concerning nuclear 
weapons." According to the Ukrainian general, "there was not a 
single case of banning or impeding the servicing of nuclear 
weapons." 
  The Ukrainian deputy defense minister expressed confidence 
that "in the near future Ukraine will resolve with Russia the 
problem of the strategic nuclear aircraft which remained on the 
Ukrainian territory." Bilateral talks are being held on this 
issue, the general pointed out.

  [Text] Kiev, 24 February -- Valentyn Lemish, chairman of 
the Commission for Defense and State Security Issues, met Armin 
Kamer, Switzerland's ambassador to Ukraine. Mr. Kamer was 
particularly interested in the possibility of the present 
composition of parliament resolving the issue of Ukraine's 
accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Valentyn 
Lemish noted the advisability of submitting this issue to the 
Supreme Council for examination in March of this year. The 
commission chairman also emphasized that it was desirable that 
the United States of America and Russia take practical steps now 
in reply to the Supreme Council resolution withdrawing the 
reservations to Article 5 of the Protocol to the START Treaty.

<F P=106> [Article by Oksana Boyko: "A Jacket of Aid for Ukraine Made </F>
in the West. A Strait-Jacket?"] 
  [Text] The ambassadors of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, 
Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, 
Spain, Great Britain, and the United States met on 14 February 
with President Leonid Kravchuk to hand him a joint declaration 
by their governments that cordially welcomed decisions made by 
the Ukrainian Supreme Council regarding the tripartite 
Declaration signed in Moscow by the Ukrainian, American, and 
Russian presidents and the START I Treaty. The above states 
expressed their intention to closely cooperate with Ukraine and 
to assist in the dismantling of nuclear weapons, the conversion 
program, environmental protection, retraining and alternative 
employment for those engaged in manufacturing and servicing the 
nuclear weapons, etc. Bilateral economic cooperation was also 
promised. 
  However, no specific figures for the aid were given. As the 
diplomats explained at the press conference, specific projects 
are now in the works, though some governments have already 
devised their programs. The Japanese ambassador mentioned $100 
million that his country intends to give to Ukraine, Russia, 
Belarus, and Kazakhstan for disarmament, while the German charge 
d'affaires said his government earmarked 10 million Deutschmarks 
for Ukraine, which were not paid because of conditions for START 
I put forward by the Ukrainian legislature. We will soon learn 
how much Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko will "bring" back from 
Bonn, where he went on an official visit. 
  So, we will have a jacket of aid made by the whole world. A 
thin jacket. The same applies to the security guarantees -- 
nothing specific was proposed here except for the bright 
prospects opened by the "Partnership for Peace" program, 
contacts with NATO and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, 
etc. In general, however, all those solemn declarations are 
simply designed to give President Kravchuk moral support in his 
relations with the parliament, because Ukraine is expected to 
join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state. 
  But another press conference was held that same day, where 
they talked about projects for Ukraine estimated at hundreds of 
millions of dollars, and at their initial stage at that. The 
multinational ABB, whose president Percy Barnevick visited 
Ukraine on the invitation of Leonid Kravchuk, is one of the 
leading corporations in power engineering. It offered us 
projects directed at Ukraine's energy independence. They 
involve energy-saving technologies in chemical and petrochemical 
industries as well as modernization of our coal and atomic power 
stations, which for Percy Barnevick are the future of Ukrainian 
power engineering. They also provide for setting up a special 
international investment fund for atomic engineering and 
Ukrainian power engineering in general. ABB is planning soon to 
start up five or six joint ventures in Ukraine to implement its 
projects.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo February 17 TASS--The present Ukrainian 
parliament will have no time to settle the question of Ukraine's 
accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, handing over 
this problem to the new legislature to be elected on March 27, 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said in an interview with 
the Japanese ASAHI newspaper in Kiev on Thursday. 
  The president said, the newspaper notes, that he "favours 
stronger economic cooperation with Russia" but denies the 
existence of a territorial issue and that "the international 
community will not recognise" stronger political ties between 
the Crimea and Russia. 
  Kravchuk referred to the tripartite agreement on the 
withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, which was signed by 
him as well as by the Russian and U.S. presidents in Moscow. 
Under this agreement, Washington assumed the role of a 
guarantor of Ukraine's territorial integrity and inviolability 
of its borders. 
  Among outstanding issues between Ukraine and Russia, 
Kravchuk 
singled out a package of questions connected with the future of 
the Black Sea Fleet. For instance, he is worried over how and 
at what price to sell the Ukrainian part of the divided fleet to 
Russia. 
  The president also expressed hope for a success of his 
coming 
U.S. visit on March 4 and his meeting with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. According to Kravchuk, this visit will "help change 
the position of the international community on Ukraine which 
will become a nuclear-free state." 
  The Ukrainian president expressed his expectations that the 
United States will fulfill its obligations to boost financial 
aid to Ukraine. "Its total sum will possibly amount to 600 or 
700 million dollars," he said.

  [Text] Lvov February 23 TASS--The Ukrainian parliament will 
not discuss the issue of joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty until it receives concrete security guarantees, according 
to a local newspaper which quoted the opinion of "leading 
circles of the supreme legislature." 
  "It remains to guess what comes first--the security 
guarantees or the technical aging of missiles liable for 
elimination," the "RESPUBLIKA" newspaper asked on Wednesday. 
  The decision of the parliament to postpone the discussion of 
the issue was confirmed by the Ukrainian president. However, he 
did not explain the reasons for the delay, the daily stressed.

  [Text] A briefing held yesterday at the Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry assessed the publication with a pretentious heading -- 
commander in chief disclaims responsibility for safety of 
nuclear missiles in Ukraine -- published by the newspaper 
IZVESTIYA on 22 February 1994 as a regular attempt of specific 
circles in the Russian Federation to exacerbate 
Russian-Ukrainian relations. Our correspondent Ihor Bak was 
present at this briefing. 
  [Begin Bak recording] First of all, I would like to clarify 
the matter for those who had not read this article. It says 
that Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of the 
Russian Strategic Missile Forces, disclaims responsibility for 
the safety of nuclear missiles deployed on Ukrainian soil. He 
reported on his decision in an official letter to the Russian 
defense minister. IZVESTIYA cites this letter and the facts 
which, as IZVESTIYA puts it, can cause social explosion in the 
missile units deployed on Ukrainian territory and produce 
unforeseeable consequences. 
  Therefore, at the briefing, Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, 
Ukrainian deputy defense minister, refuted all the figures and 
facts cited by IZVESTIYA. He admitted as trustworthy only the 
information on the number of launchers for SS-19 and SS-24 
missiles which remained in combat readiness. Ivan Bizhan deemed 
as an invention claims that the commander of the 43d Missile 
Army Uladymir Mikhtyuk was forced to swear the Ukrainian loyalty 
oath. He is commander of the Army in which the prevailing 
majority of officers and warrant officers had voluntarily sworn 
allegiance to Ukraine. Moreover, history [as heard] makes 
officers -- who for some reasons do not want to do it -- swear 
loyalty to Ukraine. Due to the fact that they are specialists 
needed by Ukraine, nobody dismisses them from their positions. 
The officer strength level in the Ukrainian Missile Forces 
stands at over 85 percent and not at 60 percent, as IZVESTIYA 
reports. There are no reasons to make a fuss concerning the 
nuclear weapons in Ukraine, stated Ukrainian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Borys Tarasyuk, at the briefing. At the same time, he 
drew the attention of the journalists to the fact that IZVESTIYA 
had more than once published texts of coded messages and other 
classified documents. Therefore, this newspaper violates the 
agreement on state secrets signed by CIS states. [end recording]

  [Text] Kiev, 10 Feb (UKRINFORM-TASS) -- A telephone 
conversation took place today between German Federal Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  During the conversation Leonid Kravchuk gave explanations on 
the question of the elimination of nuclear weapons and also 
touched on bilateral Ukrainian-German relations. He stressed 
that Ukraine is fulfilling its obligations connected with moving 
toward nonnuclear status. It was also stressed that the 
fulfilment of these obligations entails a vast financial 
expenditure that is an inordinate burden on the Ukrainian 
economy. In this connection a request was made to Germany to 
give financial and technical assistance for Ukraine to fulfil 
its obligtions to eliminate nuclear weapons. There was also 
discussion of expanding economic relations between the two 
states. 
  For his part, the federal chancellor expressed understanding 
of the problems that Ukraine is tackling and stressed that 
Germany desires that Ukraine should maintain its sovereignty and 
move successfully along the path of reforms. 
  The leaders of the two states agreed on specific steps that 
will be made toward the further development of relations between 
Ukraine and Germany.

  [Text] Bonn, 14 Feb -- Ivan Piskovyy, Ukrainian Ambassador 
to Germany, recently visited the FRG Foreign Ministry and held a 
conversation with Dr. Josef Holik, the federal government 
spokesman on disarmament and arms control . 
  The federal government spokesman highly evaluated the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council's decision and the trilateral 
statement by the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. presidents which 
cleared the way for Ukraine's nuclear-free future. Ivan 
Piskovyy emphasized that Ukraine and its leadership now need 
political, moral, and financial support which would make the 
implementation of the nuclear disarmament program possible. 
  These purposes, the ambassador said, could be served, among 
other things, by an international nuclear disarmament bank in 
Ukraine, an idea which was once put forward by Ukraine President 
Leonid Kravchuk. The German side was handed a draft agreement 
on setting up such a fund.

  On his part, Strobe Talbott pointed out that the decision by 
the Ukrainian parliament makes its possible to significantly 
increase U.S. aid to our state toward the implementation of the 
programs of dismantling and eliminating nuclear weapons 
stationed on its territory. He also put special emphasis on the 
personal contribution and political courage of the president of 
Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, who had been defending consistently 
and selflessly the necessity of the full-scale ratification of 
START I and the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty by 
Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan </F>
Bizhan by Marat Pohorelov; place and date not given; from the 
"Independence" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Pohorelov: Many lances have been broken 
on the issue of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. The 
concrete steps toward the resolution of this issue are often 
assessed without taking into account the actual reality and the 
set of all existent factors, that is to say, in a one-sided 
parochial view. Therefore, the issue returns once and again to 
be viewed in our programs. Today we will take a look at this 
with the help of General Colonel Ivan Bizhan, deputy defense 
minister. 
  Bizhan: Despite the fact that a great deal has 
been said about this issue in the press, television, and on the 
radio, many people are still interested in it. I would like to 
say one more time that not a treaty but a declaration and an 
annex to this declaration were signed by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and the United States in 
Moscow. There are no significant discrepancies between this 
declaration and the Supreme Council resolution on ratifying the 
START I treaty. I would also want to emphasize that Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament issue involves the United States as well. 
This is exactly what we have wanted from the very beginning, 
when we began to address this issue. 
  Carefully looking at the annex to the statement signed by 
the 
presidents, one can see that the Russian Federation for the 
first time committed to service the nuclear warheads deployed in 
Ukraine, and which, according to the agreement, will be 
gradually transferred to Russia for dismantling. This is also 
one of the problems which we had been trying to solve, but which 
Russia had been refusing to solve, intending to exert pressure 
on Ukraine through this or to force it to adopt certain 
decisions. You know that we ourselves cannot maintain these 
nuclear warheads. Now, one does not have to convince anybody 
that the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine are our property. 
As you remember, one had to do this until recently, because the 
Russian Federation by no means wanted to admit that. It claimed 
that these weapons once belonged to the Soviet Union, and now 
they should be inherited by the Russian Federation. Therefore, 
it considered itself the only inheritor of these nuclear 
weapons. Now, when this problem has ceased to exist, another one 
arises: What should our state do with these nuclear weapons 
inherited after the downfall of the Soviet Union? For example, 
what could be done with the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine? 
Some people say that Ukraine should be a nuclear state. If 
this problem [of Ukraine's nuclear status] is examined in the 
context of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine, then how can 
Ukraine become a nuclear state? If we agree with the Russian 
Federation that Russia will service the nuclear weapons deployed 
in Ukraine, and that it will replace nuclear warheads whose 
warranty and shelf life have expired, and that it will hand over 
to us the systems of control...[Bizhan pauses] However, while 
saying that, we should ask ourselves a question: Will Russia 
agree with that? Will the United States agree? Will other 
states agree? And a whole range of other questions. This is 
unreal. To link our nuclear weapons to the nuclear status of 
the state is the only way, however unreal. 
  Assuming that Ukraine should become a nuclear state, it will 
be necessary to adopt a resolution to establish an entire 
infrastructure which a nuclear state should have. We do not 
have such a structure. Specialists should give their opinion on 
whether it is possible or not to do this. Although they have 
already said a lot about this, let them say more. What will 
this involve; what problems will this cause; what costs are 
entailed? What will be the consequences of this decision? Do 
we need that? Will this increase our security? There are also 
other problems we should resolve in this regard. Thus, the 
nuclear weapons deployed on the territory of our state and the 
nuclear status of our state are two different issues. Now we 
should solve this issue. The declaration signed by the 
president of our state and the annex to it concern nuclear 
weapons that we inherited from the Soviet Union and we currently 
possess. However, while solving this issue, we should proceed 
from objective circumstances. No matter what we say and what 
decisions are adopted, the circumstances are dictating [their 
terms] now. What kind of circumstances? For example, every 
nuclear warhead has a certain warranty period. You know that 
President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk, at a news conference given 
at Boryspil airport following his return from Moscow, said that 
the warranties of all the nuclear weapons deployed in our state 
will expire in 1999 or 2000. However, they begin to expire as 
early as this year. Therefore, a certain number of nuclear 
warheads will surpass their shelf life this year. This means 
that we will have to deal with this problem every year. No 
matter what decisions we adopt, we should resolve the problem of 
nuclear weapons which have surpassed their shelf life. 
Actually, nuclear weapons are one of the powerful security 
guarantees for a state, but only if a state is really a nuclear 
one. 
  For example, if we had all those elements, or all that 
infrastructure that accounts for the status of a nuclear state, 
this would unquestionably be a guarantee of our security. 
However, the things are not like that. The nuclear weapons 
deployed in Ukraine today cannot be a guarantee of our security 
because these weapons are nothing more than our property. The 
entire control system, the entire production system, the entire 
servicing and testing system is in the Russian Federation. No 
matter what our desires are, this is true. For some reason, we 
have recently discussed only those nuclear weapons which are 
deployed on our territory, having in mind the problems, or 
aspects, of our security. However, we should not forget the 
fact that, with regard to conventional arms, to conventional 
armed forces, our state is the second [power] on the continent, 
after the Russian Federation. Is this not an aspect of our 
state's security? It is, and it is an aspect that we can 
maintain on such a level of combat readiness, which would allow 
our Armed Forces to defend our state. It could be done at the 
expense of resolving the issue of nuclear weapons which are now 
in Ukraine. First of all, I have in mind financial aspects, 
when we will be able to allot larger funds to our conventional 
Armed Forces. Therefore, I think that we should not forget 
about this issue, too. Besides, the issue of our state security 
is an issue of our integration with European structures, 
including the Partnership for Peace program adopted during the 
recent NATO session. We should participate. We should 
integrate with NATO and other structures. It will also be one of 
the guarantees of our security. 
  I do not want to mention such issues as friendly relations 
with other states, in particular, with neighboring states, or 
the resolution of our many heavy economic problems. The 
resolution of these problems will also grant us security 
guarantees. Having resolved the issue of nuclear weapons 
deployed in our state, we will be able to resolve those other 
problems and aspects that constitute the entire body of our 
state security. 
  Pohorelov: Ivan Vasylyovich, let us close our 
interview with the following summation of the nuclear weapon 
issue in Ukraine today: One cannot be a king for only one day 
-- one must also think about the future. 
  Bizhan: Yes, you are right. Our status with 
regard to nuclear weapons, which are actually our property, is a 
temporary situation. This temporary situation will terminate at 
the end of the year of 2000. The number of nuclear warheads 
will be decreasing every year. No matter what resolution we 
adopt, the objective circumstances will drive us toward a 
reduction of nuclear warheads deployed on Ukraine's territory. 
It is because of objective circumstances and the connection 
with serious issues related to the nuclear and ecological 
security of our state. I do not think anyone will adopt a 
resolution which could bring tragedy, either nuclear or 
environmental.

  [Text] Kiev, 14 Feb -- Vasyl Durdynets, first deputy 
chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council and coordinator of the 
group of deputies for issues to do with ratification of the 
START Treaty, was interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent on 
nuclear problems and conditions for Ukraine to accede to the 
Lisbon protocol. 
  Mr. Durdynets noted that for these issues to be settled by 
the current parliament first of all guarantees from nuclear 
states are needed. There should be documents, in his opinion, 
which would make it legally binding on them not to use nuclear 
and conventional weapons against Ukraine, rule out economic 
pressure and guarantee the integrity and inviolability of our 
borders. The Foreign Ministry is now at work developing the 
form of guarantees. Mr. Durdynets emphasized that the accession 
of Ukraine to the Lisbon protocol and the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state is unrealistic. 
This contravenes both its military doctrine and official 
foreign policy. Mr. Durdynets's view is that "a state owning 
nuclear weapons" is the most acceptable formula for Ukraine. 
  On the question of the funds required to dismantle Ukrainian 
nuclear weapons, Vasyl Durdynets said a group of experts from 
Kharkov's physics and technology institute worked out an 
estimate for this. It came up with the minimum sum of $2.8 
billion. This sum is at today's rate. Mr. Durdynets spoke in 
favor of setting up a nuclear disarmament fund under UN auspices. 
  With regard to selling conventional weapons, Mr. Durdynets 
stressed that 38 percent of the USSR's military industrial 
complex was concentrated in Ukraine, although this issue so far 
remains unresolved. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, in his 
view, ought to defend somewhat more actively Ukraine's right to 
trade arms with the international community. 
  Vasyl Kryuchkov, member of the standing committee for issues 
of defense and state security, is of the opinion that the 
minimum sum required to dismantle Ukrainian nuclear weapons is 
$5 billion. If done professionally, it could be as much as $10 
billion.

<F P=106> [Press Agency NOVYNY interview with Ukrainian Minister of </F>
Environmental Protection Yuriy Kostenko; place and date not 
given: "It Is Not Disarmament, but Stripping the State Bare" -- 
first paragraph published in boldface] 
  [Text] Being convinced that the tripartite agreement on 
the fate of Ukrainian strategic missiles that he signed conforms 
to the parliamentary decree on this issue, Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk asked the people's deputies to annul their 
reservations regarding Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol and to 
adopt a decision on Ukraine joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty as a nonnuclear state. 
  This is how the Moscow statement was commented upon by Yuriy 
Kostenko, people's deputy, minister of environmental protection, 
and head of the special working group of deputies in charge of 
the preparation for ratifying START-1 and acquiring Ukraine's 
nonnuclear status. 
  Kostenko: The Moscow tripartite statement has, in 
fact, offered an entirely different procedure for Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament, a procedure different from what our Supreme 
Council decided on the issue. The new procedure does not take 
into account many aspects, associated both with Ukraine's 
national security and its economic interests. For this 
particular reason, the Moscow statement must be regarded as a 
totally different agreement and must be given a corresponding 
legal evaluation. 
  NOVYNY: However, it is a statement, and not an 
agreement. The parliament cannot either ratify or refuse to 
ratify it. 
  Kostenko: I realize this. The statement is 
formulated in such a manner as to make it impossible for the 
Supreme Council to consider it. These are so-called legal 
intrigues. However, one cannot overlook the fact that the 
supreme legislative body has adopted one procedure for nuclear 
disarmament and, at the same time, the executive power has 
proposed an entirely different one. That is why the Supreme 
Council, which has the right, ensured by the current 
Constitution, to discuss international agreements, also has the 
right to discuss this particular document and determine whether 
it is advantageous for Ukraine or, perhaps, it should be vetoed 
as being at variance with Ukraine's interests. Moreover, I want 
to stress the following point: The work conducted by the 
Supreme Council would, in my opinion, make it possible to more 
or less coordinate Ukraine's interests with those of other 
states that seek Ukraine's nonnuclear status. I do not see 
Ukraine's interests, either economic or military, in the Moscow 
document. Nor do I see there any security guarantees for 
Ukraine, guarantees about which there has been so much talk. 
  NOVYNY: How would you comment upon the fact that 
neither the statement, nor the supplement to it makes any 
mention of compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons 
transferred to Russia? 
  Kostenko: This once again emphasizes the fact 
that there exist certain discrepancies between what the Supreme 
Council adopted and what the president signed. The parliament's 
decree states clearly that there must also be compensation for 
the tactical nuclear weapons, whereas the Moscow statement does 
not deal with this issue separately. As far as I am concerned, 
Russia is just promising to consider this question and give some 
compensation. 
  NOVYNY: Is there any deadline for giving Ukraine 
compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons? 
  Kostenko: No, no deadline has been specified. 
Besides, this is difficult to do, because nobody knows at the 
expense of what this compensation must be made. If it is done 
from the money received for those 500 tonnes of highly enriched 
uranium that Russia will sell to the United States, compensation 
may only be given to Ukraine after the uranium is sold on the 
world market. Only after that will Russia receive some real 
money and be able to give some monetary compensation. Today, 
there are no funds, absolutely nothing. It is true that there 
also exists such a variant (it might be the most acceptable one 
for Ukraine) as compensation for the cost of every warhead. 
This could be done, because it is known how much uranium or 
plutonium they contain, and, therefore, the cost of the tactical 
weapons transferred by us might be determined. In accordance 
with preliminary estimates, it is more than $10 billion. If we 
proceed from this sum, Russia is indebted to Ukraine and not the 
other way round, as we are being assured today. Speaking about 
energy sources, in view of the fact that uranium and plutonium 
are extremely valuable energy sources, it might be possible to 
make an equivalent exchange: We can give them highly enriched 
uranium and plutonium and they can give us oil and gas. 
Unfortunately, however, this procedure was not adopted, 
moreover, during the negotiations, such an element as plutonium 
was totally "omitted." It is a very expensive element. By 
various estimates, 1 kg of highly enriched plutonium may cost up 
to $1 million and 1 kg of highly enriched uranium $100,000. 
Just imagine the cost of the materials that we have already 
transferred to Russia. 
  NOVYNY: Transferred with tactical weapons? 
  Kostenko: Yes, with tactical weapons alone, we 
transferred [to Russia] about 10 tonnes of highly enriched 
plutonium and about 90 tonnes of highly enriched uranium. What 
happened in Moscow cannot be referred to as nuclear disarmament; 
it is the stripping of the state bare. Not only in military, 
but also in economic and political aspects. 
  NOVYNY: The following information is known to 
have been leaked from presidential circles: If Ukraine had not 
agreed to concessions in Washington and in Boryspil, and then 
also in Moscow, it might have found itself in international 
political and economic isolation. What is your attitude to this? 
  Kostenko: I cannot agree with this thesis, 
because it is not the availability of nuclear weapons that 
determines the possibility of international isolation, about 
which there is so much talk. Had it been so, all those states 
that presently create nuclear weapons would also have found 
themselves in isolation. Today, there are about 20 countries 
worldwide that either have their own nuclear weapons, or are 
about to create them. These are so-called threshold states, 
which are in violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
Ukraine proceeds along the road toward nuclear disarmament, 
and, for that reason, it cannot constitute an obstacle to anyone. 
  That we do not, today, have effective economic ties with 
other countries points to one circumstance only -- the absence 
of reforms in Ukraine. We do not make a single step toward 
reforms, and as long as there are no reforms, industrial circles 
and financiers with large capital will not be interested in 
cooperating with Ukraine or in investing in its economy. That 
is why, if somebody says, today, that nuclear weapons have 
brought about Ukraine's international isolation, it will be an 
erroneous assessment of the situation that has taken shape. We 
will soon become convinced of this. Even after the entire 
disarmament strategy proposed by our president is implemented, 
investments will not flow into Ukraine all the same. They will 
nor flow as long as there are no real reforms. Incidentally, 
this was also stressed by Mr. Clinton, who said that Ukraine 
would only be given $175 million and the rest when economic 
reforms begin to be implemented.

  [Text] The press service of the Ukrainian president and 
the Government has reported that Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk had a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton yesterday. During the conversation, the presidents 
expressed satisfaction over the dynamically developing 
Ukrainian-U.S. relations. In particular, Bill Clinton highly 
commended the political course and practical actions by the 
Ukrainian leadership to destroy nuclear weapons according to the 
recent resolution of the Ukrainian parliament concerning the 
START Treaty. He also expressed the hope that Ukraine will 
shortly join the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
All these steps, in the U.S. President's opinion, open new 
possibilities for efficient economic cooperation between Ukraine 
and the United States both through mutual links and influential 
international financial institutions. Leonid Kravchuk and Bill 
Clinton concluded that the issues they had agreed on, after 
being worked on by experts and government officials, will be 
prepared as documents, some of which will be signed during the 
official visit of the Ukrainian president to the United States 
on 3-7 March 1994.

  [Text] As many as 13 industrialized countries are prepared 
to offer assistance to Ukraine in dismantling nuclear weapons. 
  The Ambassadors of Denmark, Norway, the Federal Germany, 
Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Britain, the 
United States, Canada, Sweden and Japan handed over in Kiev 
Monday a message to President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  The document says that Western governments welcome the 
ratification by the Ukrainian parliament of the Moscow statement 
made by presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the United States 
about the elimination of Ukrainian nuclear weapons and the fact 
that the Ukrainian parliament asked the government to exchange 
instruments of ratification with signatories of the START I 
Treaty. 
  At the news conference following the meeting with Ukrainian 
President, the Ambassadors of the above countries said that the 
NATO governments intend to cooperate on a bilateral basis not 
only in dismantling nuclear weapons, but in restoring the 
environment, conversion of the military production and 
re-training of the military personnel.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with chief of staff Anatoliy Lopata; </F>
place and date not given: "Not Operational"] 
  [Text] Are the nuclear missiles stationed in Ukraine a 
threat to international peace? Moscow says they are. For a 
long time Washington also stuck to its anti-Ukrainian course, 
while the Kiev government feels that it has been wrongfully 
branded as the scapegoat. FOCUS talked about the background of 
the missile controversy with Ukrainian Chief of Staff Anatoliy 
Lopata. The 53- year-old former Soviet commander sees himself 
as belonging to the new generation of the Ukrainian Army. 
  FOCUS: General Lopata, what is going to happen 
with the 1,800 nuclear warheads and 176 missiles? 
  Lopata: We regard the nuclear arms as a legacy 
from the Soviet Union. The missiles are under Ukrainian control 
only in the administrative sense, while operationally they are 
controlled by Moscow. We have no control over the guiding 
systems, which means they are not operational for us. Ukraine 
only services and maintains the missiles. They are rather like 
red-hot coals that were put into our hands. We may turn them 
round and round but they will always burn our hand. 
  FOCUS: How safe are the missiles? 
  Lopata: This question is one of our main 
challenges. The SS- 19 are quite outdated systems. Each 
missile base has exact rules for servicing. Both, the Russian 
Defense Ministry and Ukraine are responsible for their 
maintenance. Our joint responsibility has been settled in 
treaties. 
  FOCUS: But there were problems with the Russian 
specialists.... 
  Lopata: You are right. Russia can use this lever 
to exert political pressure. However, the supervisory guarantee 
lies with the Russian specialists, and we have to pay them for 
their services. 
  FOCUS: But they can also refuse to.... 
  Lopata: No, they are bound by contract. As far 
as the nuclear warheads are concerned, we must not forget that 
all combat components were produced in Russia. Ukraine set up 
the missiles, provided the bases, while the production center 
was always in Russia. Hundreds of enterprises used to be 
involved in one missile and its warheads. That is why the 
treaty establishes that the very enterprise that assembled the 
components is responsible for its return. Each missile has 
certain dates for inspection. Sometimes the deadlines for 
certain components are missed as a result of the political 
insecurities. Nevertheless, we have so far carried out all 
necessary work. 
  FOCUS: It has been said that the lifespan of some 
warheads will expire in 1994. 
  Lopata: This year it affects only an 
insignificant part of the warheads, 10 percent may have to be 
inspected. Yet, next year it will be more, and so it will 
continue year after year. The lifespan of most missiles does 
not expire before the year 2000. 
  FOCUS: Does this means that the nuclear threat 
remains? 
  Lopata: I would like to emphasize that Ukraine 
does not regard the nuclear missiles on its territory as arms. 
They are mainly of significant material value. Our objective 
is to return the fissile material that is produced through the 
destruction of the missiles, to Ukraine -- for our nuclear power 
plants. The United States, Russia, and Ukraine have agreed 
that, with the help of the Americans, Russia will take care of 
dismantling the warheads and reprocessing the fissile material 
and returning it to Ukraine. Of course, Russia would like to 
keep its secrets. 
  FOCUS: Are there still any real secrets between 
the major superpowers in this day and age? 
  Lopata: The greatest secret remains the 
technology for the production in the individual enterprises. 
The United States does not have systems such as our SS-24, and 
will not have them in the near future, either. These are 
absolutely new and powerful systems with a very high accuracy. 
It is almost impossible to destroy these missile bases, even if 
their location is known. After each strike the missile starts 
automatically and carries out a counterstrike. 
  FOCUS: Yeltsin has promised that the missiles 
would no longer be targeted at the United States. How can he 
say that, considering that the missiles start automatically? 
  Lopata: When the program is removed the missile 
cannot start. There is one program block that contains various 
targets. Each target can be automatically selected, even during 
flight -- yet if this block is removed all that remains is a 
missile that is only potentially operational. I prefer not to 
tell you for how long, though. 
  FOCUS: What is the nationality of the missile 
personnel? 
  Lopata: The soldiers and sergeants are all 
Ukrainian citizens, while at the level of officers it is about 
50 percent. They all can choose their place of living and work 
-- either in Ukraine or in Russia. This is the personal 
decision of each individual. A large part was ready to swear to 
defend Ukraine. Another part -- mostly Russians -- opted for 
Russia. According to our estimates some 70 percent remain in 
Ukraine. All this is taking place in a very friendly atmosphere. 
  FOCUS: Yet, in the Crimea things are different.... 
  Lopata: True, but we are trying to solve the 
problem with great caution. One condition is not to raise 
mutual territorial claims. The future of the Black Sea fleet 
and the Crimea are closely linked. It is not just a question of 
dividing up the fleet but also of the territory of the Crimea 
for the infrastructure of the fleet. 
  Communication systems, energy supply, and infrastructure of 
the Crimea are organically connected with Ukraine. The Crimea 
does not contribute anything to the state budget, but only 
causes expenses. Tourism does not yield any profits, the water 
and energy supply is paid for by Ukraine. 
  FOCUS: There are many countries in the Third 
World that are interested in the production of nuclear missiles. 
Do you know cases of Russia or Ukraine having supplied material 
to such countries? 
  Lopata: No, no, and no again. 
  FOCUS: But there have been most lucrative offers 
-- a great temptation for scientists who only earn some $20 a 
month. 
  Lopata: This danger will always exist. Besides, 
we only have limited possibilities to verify whether a scientist 
does not also works for somebody else. Every single one is 
personally responsible for one component or for a certain piece 
of information. It is necessary to create prospects for these 
people here. 
  FOCUS: Have there been cases where other 
countries wanted to buy nuclear arms or nuclear technology? 
  Lopata: I suspect that such attempts have been 
made. 
  FOCUS: How big is the military-industrial complex 
in Ukraine? 
  Lopata: Taking into account that the main part of 
the complex of the Soviet Union was shared between Russia and 
Ukraine, then Ukraine comes second today, after Russia. We used 
to have two academies, including one for missile technology, 34 
military schools, research institutes, and test laboratories. 
  FOCUS: How many plants are there? 
  Lopata: Well, not even we ourselves know that 
exactly. Nobody ever thought of counting them. You must 
understand the system. In the Soviet Union each plant, each 
enterprise fulfilled tasks even for the military complex. Today 
we are using no more than 15 percent of the former armament 
enterprises for military purposes. We gave up financing the 
huge complexes. Ukraine no longer places any arms orders. 
  FOCUS: So who still buys the arms that are still 
being produced? 
  Lopata: We hardly produce any more arms. If we 
do not order tanks they are not produced. For economic reasons, 
we have been forced to embark on the path of disarmament. For 
the future we would need research to launch our new Ukrainian 
tank on the market, for example. Yet, we do not have the money 
to produce it. 
  FOCUS: If somebody from Syria or Iraq were to 
ask, would you sell him something? 
  Lopata: If the offer were worthwhile, the 
government would examine it. We must look for customers. 
  FOCUS: Ukraine has demanded security guarantees 
against its powerful neighbor, Russia. Still, you do not have 
any troops at your eastern border. 
  Lopata: The creation of new structures along our 
eastern border is currently impossible for money problems. 
Ukraine does not need large armed forces but mobile reaction 
forces to protect its borders.

  [Text] Kiev, 21 Feb -- Members of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine Presidium discussed the working agenda of the Supreme 
Council session on 22-26 February. The issues of an 
all-Ukrainian referendum, Ukraine's membership in the CIS 
countries' economic union, and the accession of Ukraine to the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] were not included in the 
agenda. 
  Participants in the presidium sitting focused their 
attention 
mainly on debating the issue of the correspondence of the 
Republic of Crimea's legislative acts with the Constitution of 
Ukraine. Vasyl Kozarenko, people's deputy of Ukraine, said this 
issue virtually could not be settled now because of the lack of 
time and absence of a mechanism whereby Crimea's legislative 
acts could be brought in line with the Constitution of Ukraine. 
Legal acts of both the president and Ukraine's and Crimea's 
parliaments must be assessed, in Vasyl Kozarenko's opinion, by a 
constitutional court, which at present is nonexistent. 
  In all, Supreme Council Presidium members included around 50 
issues in next week's plenary agenda. The issue of introducing 
changes and amendments to some of Ukraine's legislative acts on 
privatization questions will primarily be tackled. Deputies are 
planning to address the question of mandatory social insurance 
contributions for 1994. 
  On 23 February, deputies are planning to discuss the Law on 
the Protection of Information in Automatic Systems in its second 
reading and elect a National Television Council [Natsionalna 
Rada po Telebachennyu]. The issue of resolving the payments 
crisis will also be looked at. 
  On Thursday, 24 February, the Supreme Council will examine 
the Law on Corruption in its second reading. Deputies are 
planning to introduce changes and amendments to the Law on the 
Elections of the President of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist 
Republic. The law was adopted in May 1991 and is still 
unchanged.

Polynesian Government, by Nicole Kern; date and place not given: 
"Flosse Behind Chirac -- President of French Polynesian 
Government Wants Nuclear Test Firings To Be Resumed, Deeming 
Them Essential for Credibility of French Defense Policy" -- 
first paragraph is LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] Gaston Flosse, the president of the French 
Polynesian Government, has a dual interest in the debate on 
stopping the Mururoa nuclear tests: first, as the top political 
leader in the region; second, as a deputy. 
  Kern: What is your position in the debate on the 
cessation of firings? 
  Flosse: As a Gaullist, my view is that we have 
already waited too long. The credibility of the French 
deterrent force is at stake. Tests are essential for our 
defense. 
  Kern: What do you think the decision not to resume 
the tests is based on? 
  Flosse: It is the president of the Republic who is 
quite firmly opposed to it. He is the head of the army. He is 
the man in charge for as long as the current period of 
cohabitation lasts. 
  Kern: Has the moratorium not had the advantage of 
enabling better relations with the other Pacific states? 
  Flosse: The nuclear tests had practically been 
forgotten in the region, and relations would not have 
deteriorated if France had not discontinued them. When the last 
test firings were made, Australia and New Zealand already 
reacted less argumentatively than in the past. At the last 
Pacific forum, the resolution opposing the tests still figured 
on the agenda, but no more than usual. On the other hand, a 
resumption of tests after the moratorium would risk heightening 
tension in the area again. 
  Kern: So you follow the same line as Jacques 
Chirac? 
  Flosse: Absolutely. For the resumption of tests 
is absolutely essential to our armaments. There is a need for 
progress in scientific research. I never saw any real motive 
for the moratorium other than pulling off a political coup. 
  Kern: Your determination may appear to be a desire 
to obtain new financial resources... 
  Flosse: Absolutely not. The past agreement with 
the defense minister within the context of the orientation law 
enabled us to obtain more than in the past. My position is not 
linked with any budgetary interest, it is purely political.

<F P=106> [Article by Adm. Marcel Duval, former chairman of our the </F>
National Defense Studies Committee and director of DEFENSE 
NATIONALE: "What Future for the Nuclear Weapons 
Nonproliferation Treaty?"] 
  [Exerpts] The Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which covers 
a 25-year period, will expire in 1995. Negotiations will then 
be needed to set the terms for its renewal. Adm. Marcel Duvan 
was kind enough to carry out an analysis of nonproliferation, of 
the treaty, of the concerns of different nuclear and nonnuclear 
states, and finally of the prospects for the future, 
particularly for our country. We are most grateful to him for 
this very complete study. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Future Prospects </H5>
  Having taken stock of nonproliferation, the term hitherto 
used to describe the totality of measures to prevent the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, let us now examine 
its future prospects on the eve of its expiry in 1995. As for 
the NPT itself, its indefinite renewal, which naturally is 
desired by the nuclear powers, would require an affirmative vote 
by 83 countries, since it is estimated that 165 countries will 
then be party to it. As the general assumption is that 45 
positive votes are guaranteed, those of at least 38 developing 
countries will also have to be secured. The Conference of 
Nonaligned States, which met in 1992, set the following 
conditions for extending the treaty: the cessation of nuclear 
tests; an end to the production of nuclear weapons; 
implementation of the START treaties; and the total elimination 
of these weapons by a given deadline. Furthermore, during the 
conference to prepare the revision of the NPT, which took place 
in May 1993, it appeared that many nonnuclear states, not all of 
which were nonaligned states, will oppose indefinite extension 
and may even propose a two-year trial period, at the end of 
which their demands would have to be implemented through 
international treaties. 
  We have seen that the United States has now decided to meet 
most of these demands by proposing the conclusion of a treaty 
totally banning nuclear tests, and of another prohibiting the 
production of fissile materials for explosive use. For its 
part, the United States has already declared a moratorium on its 
tests until 1995, and stopped its production of fissile 
materials, while also accepting international monitoring of its 
stocks. In addition, it has ceased modernization of its nuclear 
arsenal, since, for the first time for 50 years, it is no longer 
running a nuclear program now that it has ceased further work on 
its mobile strategic missile, and it canceled both its light 
strategic missile program and its programs for new nuclear 
warheads for its Trident submarine missiles and for new nuclear 
missiles for its B2 bombers. It has also undertaken the 
dismantling required by the START treaties, even though these 
have not yet been ratified by the other parties. In the face of 
this voluntary disarmament, some have wondered, analyzing 
statements by Americans in senior positions, whether this did 
not amount to a delegitimization by the United States of nuclear 
weapons so as to derive maximum advantage from its undisputed 
conventional superiority over any possible adversaries anywhere 
in the world. 
  Nevertheless, problems may still arise with other 
protagonists involved in the renewal of the NPT and the adoption 
of any other planned nonproliferation agreements linked to it. 
First, take the chaotic situation in the former Soviet Union, 
which particularly raises, as has been seen, the problem of 
Ukraine's adherence to the NPT. There will then remain the task 
of dismantling those nuclear weapons affected by the START 
treaty, which will take over 10 years and will require 
considerable financial assistance, not to mention the 
difficulties arising from the international monitoring of its 
implementation. To these concerns we should add, mindful of the 
Chernobyl catastrophe, those over the safety of nuclear plants 
for peaceful purposes and over the possibility of subjecting 
these plants to the controls which will inevitably be required 
by a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for 
weapons use. Finally, it is obvious that the degree to which all 
these proposals are welcomed in 1995 will be primarily 
influenced by the actions taken before this expiry by China, the 
most "proliferating" state whose actions frequently differ from 
its statements and which has the right of veto. It will also 
depend on the behavior of the undeclared nuclear powers. In 
other words, it will depend on Iraq's respect for its commitment 
to accepting long-term monitoring of its disarmament; on the 
outcome of the present confrontation over monitoring North 
Korea's installations; regarding Israel and Iran, on the peace 
process presently under way in the Middle East; while it may be 
hoped that the mutual deterrence between India and Pakistan will 
prevent their dispute over Kashmir from degenerating into open 
war. History teaches us that disarmament of all kinds is far 
more often a consequence of peace than the necessary 
prerequisite for it. This means that the struggle to prevent 
proliferation is undoubtedly far more of a political process, 
particularly at a regional level, than a matter of preventive 
technocratic measures. This does not imply that the latter have 
no effect, even if it is only to do everything possible to avoid 
the use of nuclear weapons in haste or in error, since, once the 
"nuclear taboo" has been breached, they have failed in their 
peace- keeping purpose. 
<H5>  Consequences for France </H5>
  We now have to consider the consequences of all the above 
for 
France, which for the past 35 years has based its defense policy 
on the peace-keeping effect of nuclear weapons, and has largely 
based its foreign policy on the independence of its deterrent. 
Thus, the "French exception" in this area will be particularly 
challenged by the nonproliferation measures to be submitted in 
1995 to the international community. 
  Of these, the major concern is obviously the total cessation 
of nuclear tests, since this not only poses both for ourselves 
and for others a threat to the safety of existing weapons, but 
would also prevent us from developing new programs, even though 
we presently have at least one major one under way, the M5, 
which, by considerably increasing both range and performance, is 
intended to give our "new generation" of nuclear-missile 
launching submarines (SNLE) "all-out" capabilities. To this 
technological constraint is added the psychological, and hence 
political one, which is bound to challenge the two super powers' 
previously-announced renunciation of mobile strategic missiles 
and multiple warheads, and of terrestrial and naval tactical 
nuclear weapons. In contrast, the cessation of production of 
fissile materials for explosive use would not appear to have any 
major consequences for our defense, at least over the medium 
term. 
  The increase in "denuclearized zones" would also seriously 
limit the freedom of action of our nuclear submarines, as they 
presently carry almost 90 percent of our nuclear deterrent 
capability. If this process were to extend to Europe, following 
the apparently conceivable withdrawal of U.S. airborne nuclear 
capacity still deployed there, then this would put an end to the 
possibility of eventually establishing a European deterrent. 
For this reason, and also to finally frame a common policy in 
this matter, it would be desirable to discuss all these 
nonproliferation measures within the European Union, or, failing 
this, on a Franco-British basis, as allowed by the recent 
establishment of a "Joint Commission on Nuclear Policy and 
Doctrine." At the national level, it would also appear 
desirable to reactivate the "Council on Exterior Nuclear 
Relations," set up in 1976 to respond to the concerns then 
beginning to be aroused here by proliferation. 
  The survival of our national deterrent, together with the 
need to consider establishing such a deterrent at the European 
level, must be justified in terms of the effectiveness to be 
expected of them in the face of threats which can be foreseen 
over a fairly long term. In this respect, the threat emanating 
from the still considerable nuclear arsenals located in the 
territory of the former Soviet Union has in no way disappeared, 
however unlikely any aggression by them appears at present. The 
greatest danger is probably that of the possibility of these 
nuclear weapons falling into the hands of groups of varying 
degrees of responsibility, for whom the exercise of our 
deterrent, backed up by the threat of massive reprisals, would 
run the risk both of being unacceptable to international public 
opinion, and of being ineffective. The same would apply, we 
believe, to any "troublemaker" located outside Europe who, armed 
with a few primitive weapons and suitable ballistic vehicles, 
would hide in some kind of "aggressive sanctuary," or even 
perpetrated nuclear blackmail. 
  In the face of such possible threats, two schools of thought 
are taking shape here. The first holds to the above doctrine, 
restricting it to the instance of major aggression, actually 
directed against our national territory, for which it feels the 
present arsenal is adequate. The second considers there is a 
need for a limited "nuclear counterthreat," capable of 
deployment overseas and intended to "inhibit" the destructive 
capacity of a terrorist state, and if need be to "decapitate" 
it. This would require, in the view of this school, very 
accurate mobile weapons with reduced collateral effects, with 
adjustable power, and the capability to penetrate the ground, 
and would thus mean new programs, and hence the need to carry 
out tests. In contrast, a rapprochement seems to be emerging 
between the two schools over the possible benefits, in the face 
of these new threats, in possessing a system based on ballistic 
theater antimissiles, or in other words a mobile system, even 
though during the Cold War France was opposed to any global 
system. Some consider that the disadvantage of establishing 
such a system is that it could give the "South" the impression 
that it is about to replace the "East" as the Western world's 
enemy. 
  The expiry in 1995 will therefore force us to formulate a 
view on all these matters. As for doctrines, we do not feel it 
is desirable to specify too closely the future conditions in 
which our nuclear deterrent could be used, or particularly to 
say what will not be done, so as to keep all our options open. 
It appears obvious that this deterrent will not be able to 
remain the absolute priority it was during the Cold War; but, as 
is amply proved by the present debates over nonproliferation and 
also those over the future course of the Security Council, it 
will certainly retain its political dimension. As it is no 
longer possible to "disinvent" the nuclear weapon, France must 
protect itself from its human know-how and its technical 
capabilities in this area, as these are largely what will ensure 
its future status as a "major medium power," and, if necessary, 
its survival if it were to be the object of any major aggression.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Before White Paper Is Released -- </F>
Most National Assembly Defense Commission Members Favor Limited 
Atomic `Strike' Capacity"] 
  [Text] France's nuclear deterrent must be adapted to new 
realities and include capabilities for limited and highly 
accurate strikes. This is the doctrine currently advocated by a 
very large majority of the National Assembly's Defense 
Commission members in the 150-page report they have just written 
to present their choices before the government presents its own 
White Paper on Defense and military planning bill. 
  This is the first such parliamentary initiative in the 30 
years that the Assembly has been required to give its opinion on 
a military planning bill. 
  RPR [Rally for the Republic] Ain representative and 
Commission President Jacques Boyon has denied charges that the 
commission views the report as a "counter White Paper"; the 
document lists the issues on which the majority and the 
opposition are in agreement, those on which there is some 
agreement between them, and those on which they disagree. PS 
[Socialist Party] Ille-et-Vilaine representative and former 
Commission President Jean-Michel Boucheron speaks of a 
"French-style consensus" on defense, with the only differences 
relating to nuclear testing and possibly the potential benefits 
of an antimissile defense system. 
  Commission members have more particularly focused on three 
basic issues: nuclear deterrence, the national service, and 
defense-related industries. 
  1. As for nuclear deterrence, the report states that "it is 
clear that while the current doctrine must be maintained, it 
needs to be adjusted to new realities. Our nuclear weapons must 
be designed bearing in mind a range of actions meant to defend 
our basic interests, and no longer our vital interests only. 
Deterrence can no longer be defined in `weak-to-strong' terms, 
but we will need capabilities for limited and highly accurate 
strikes. Such enlarged deterrence must prompt us to renew our 
nuclear weapon systems," which, according to a majority of 
commission members, presupposes resumed atomic testing even 
though "our current weapons are perfectly operational until 
2005." The commission notes that a broad consensus has emerged 
in favor of two nuclear "components": strategic submarines and a 
nuclear missile carried by the Rafale [fighter-bomber] (without 
choosing among Matra's competing Apache missile and 
Aerospatiale's ASLP [long-range air-to-surface missile]). 
  2. Conscription: This is the commission's preferred option 
as opposed to that of an exclusively professional army. The 
report notes that "developing civilian forms of national service 
must entail very high requirements with regard to equality of 
implementation -- equality among such new forms as well as with 
the military service. In any event, the search for new civilian 
forms must remain compatible with national defense requirements, 
and the needs of the Defense Ministry must retain priority 
status." 
  3. Industry: Most commission members -- a few of whom are 
the elected representatives of regions which boast armament 
production concerns -- condemn the general planning 
commissioner's recent report which suggests that, since France 
cannot do everything on its own due to financial considerations, 
it should abandon some activity areas in order to concentrate on 
priority sectors. 
  The report states that "clear differences have emerged as to 
the idea of focusing on some sectors of excellence and 
abandoning others, as apparently suggested in a recent planning 
report. A broad majority of commission members oppose this 
notion, deemed suicidal and unrealistic for our defense 
industry, and dangerous for our national independence. On the 
other hand, the commission acknowledges the need for European 
cooperation on a number of weapon types."

  [Text] Paris, Feb 16 (AFP) -- France's conventional forces 
will have a new role independent of nuclear weapons under a 
defence white paper being prepared by the government, officials 
said Wednesday. 
  A meeting of the country's defence council attended by 
President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, 
other top ministers and senior officers was set to approve the 
white paper later Wednesday [16 February]. 
  Since German reunification, France has carried out partial 
nuclear disarmament, reorganised its command structure and 
reduced its troop numbers. 
  The purpose of the white paper was to define post-Cold War 
strategy for the next 20 years, the officials said. 
  Up until the collapse of the Soviet Union, French strategy 
was founded on a single scenario -- a massive French 
conventional engagement alongside NATO allies in Central Europe, 
most likely in former Czechoslovakia. 
  The white paper sets out six scenarios for the commitment of 
French forces, the officials said, starting with "major 
conflict," implying use of nuclear weapons. 
  Others range through use of force to protect sovereignty of 
overseas posessions and the French sphere of influence in Africa 
and French action in a regional conflict developing from the 
breakup of the Soviet Union. 
  The white paper also states the need for French forces to be 
capable of sustaining long-term and distant operations, as in 
peace- keeping in Yugoslavia and Cambodia, and as in the Gulf 
war. 
  Mitterrand resisted pressure for change in nuclear strategy, 
informed sources said, and his views prevailed. 
  Sections of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) 
lobbied 
for a resumption of nuclear testing in order to develop small 
warheads that could be used in limited operations in a "madman" 
scenario. 
  Instead the strategy remains that of "the weak against the 
strong," as during the Cold War when the French deterrent was 
aimed against tens of thousands of Soviet warheads, the sources 
said. 
  Mitterrand has ordered an acceleration in the development of 
a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, the M5, scheduled to 
succeed the M45 in the year 2005. 
  The white paper will be presented to parliamentary defence 
and foreign affairs comissions ahead of debate in the National 
Assembly next June on financing new weapons over the five years 
1995-2000.

<F P=106> [Dominique Garraud Report: "Defense -- A White Paper </F>
Controlled by Mitterrand"] 
  [Text] The government's defense White Paper for the years 
2010- 2015 is coming up the home straight. Today, Francois 
Mitterrand will convene his second and last defense council 
which will include his prime minister, the foreign, defense and 
economy ministers, and France's main military leaders. At the 
same time, it was announced yesterday in the Official Journal 
that Edouard Balladur and Francois Leotard will on 23 February 
be presenting the document to the National Assembly defense 
committee and the Senate's foreign affairs committee, which have 
been specially convened for the event. This announcement 
appears to indicate that the White Paper will suffer no setbacks 
due to cohabitation. 
  A demonstration of a consensus "a la francaise" on defense, 
this agreement is however the result of a compromise imposed by 
the president, especially on the central issue of the nuclear 
deterrent force. RPR [Rally for the Republic] deputy Jacques 
Baumel, the vice president of the National Assembly's defense 
committee, said that the White Paper would be "the bastard child 
of cohabitation," and the facts would seem to support his 
statement. After being voluntarily excluded from the process of 
studying and drawing-up the paper which was assigned to some 100 
experts in military affairs, Francois Mitterrand carefully 
waited for the moment to make his mark. The general secretary 
of the Elysee, Hubert Vedrine, indirectly participated in the 
development of the document, keeping in close contact with 
Nicolas Bazire, Edouard Balladur's principle private secretary. 
The head of state had already met with the defense council on 8 
December to discuss the White Paper. 
  Francois Mitterrand underlined this role of "guardian of the 
doctrine" firstly by banning the resumption of nuclear testing 
before the end of his presidential mandate, flying in the face 
of all political and military advice from the parliamentary 
majority. He then again stressed the role just before the NATO 
summit at the start of January in Brussels. In an interview 
with AFP on 9 January, the head of state reaffirmed not only his 
"hostility" to resuming nuclear testing but also described the 
future tools of the French nuclear deterrent force: "In 1992 I 
decided to provide our next-generation submarines with a new 
missile (...) in the knowledge that this missile could also be 
installed on the Albion platform." 
  In short, this concerns the continued and accelerated 
development of the M5 ballistic missile intended to succeed the 
M45 by the year 2000 on submarines, and to develop a land-based 
version, the MS5 to replace the current S3D's on the Albion 
platform. This option has once again been pulled apart by a 
number of military chiefs and certain members of the 
parliamentary majority who would rather quite simply shut Albion 
down and modernize and develop the airborne force currently 
equipped with mid-range missiles (ASMP). 
  Moreover, it is no coincidence the Francois Mitterrand 
omitted to mention the airborne force in his interview. For 
months now, he has been careful to avoid the so-called French 
"weak to strong" doctrine (at one time opposing the tens of 
thousands of Soviet warheads) from becoming a "strong to weak or 
mad" deterrent which implies the modernization of the French 
arsenal with miniature and "decapitating" charges that could be 
carried by combat aircraft. 
  With the backing of Edouard Balladur, who, it seems, is 
little inclined to follow the (essentially RPR) promoters of 
doctrinal change, the White Paper should remain faithful to the 
initial doctrine, including the delivery of an "ultimate 
deterrent force." However, it will also stress the French desire 
to conclude a total nuclear test ban treaty. As for components 
of the nuclear force (air, sea, and submarine), it should 
advocate their reduction to two from three, although without 
specifying the one that would remain alongside the nuclear 
missile-launching submarines... 
  These details will have to be provided in the military 
planning law for 1995-2000 which should be put before parliament 
next June. This plan must decide on the finances that will be 
earmarked over five years for the development of new weapons. 
No doubt that Francois Mitterrand will ensure that the M5 
program is not sacrificed. 
  The planning law will take its lead from the White Paper, 
which describes the restructuring of the defense tool according 
to the evolution of the strategic situation. There are six 
possible scenarios: from a major crisis (that could require a 
nuclear response) to a crisis of sovereignty (in the French 
overseas departments and territories), and including regional 
crises. From this it should be possible to deduce the formats 
of the forces capable of intervening (quickly and far) and of 
managing several crises at once. These directions will ensure a 
certain autonomy for the conventional forces which, until now, 
have been completely separate from the nuclear deterrent option 
in the framework of an East-West conflict. The philosophy 
behind the White Paper is therefore to be found in Francois 
Leotard's constantly repeated statement that he does not want to 
see France "lowering her guard." 
  The problem is how to finance these ambitions. Here, the 
outlook is gloomy, given the requirements of Edouard Balladur's 
five year law on public spending control. A little while ago, 
the chiefs of staff were mentioning 5 percent as a figure for 
the annual volume increase in military arms expenditure between 
1995 and 2000. According to the national arms delegation, a 
"scant 3 percent" is needed to maintain the programs already 
launched (the Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft 
carrier, the Leclerc tank, the Tigre/Gerfaut and NH90 
helicopters, next-generation submarines, and ballistic missiles) 
for which the global cost would be around 574 billion French 
francs. The defense ministry has, for its part, envisaged 
scenarios based on 5 percent, 3 percent and 1 percent rises, and 
rises of even less that 1 percent. Francois Leotard today says 
that he "cannot do" with a rise of less than 1.5 percent. 
  That is the paradox: However smooth cohabitation was on the 
drafting of the White Paper, a nice intergovernmental and 
intramajority dispute on the military planning law is to be 
expected.

<F P=106> [Column by Rene Galy-Dejean, chairman of the National </F>
Assembly's Defense Commission and Rally for the Republic deputy 
in Paris: "Mr. Mitterrand's Trap" -- first paragraph is LE MONDE 
introduction] 
  [Text] After the ministerial meeting in the Elysee 
[presidential office] on Wednesday 15 February to discuss the 
Defense White Paper, Rene Galy-Dejean, author of two 
parliamentary reports on nuclear testing and the armaments 
industry, accused Francois Mitterrand of setting a trap for the 
majority concerning the M5 strategic missile. 
  One of the particularly tough problems in the military 
planning law is to be found in the fate reserved for the future 
M5 missile. Between 2005 and 2010, this missile could replace 
the M45, which is currently under development for the new 
generation of submarines. The M45 will carry the latest nuclear 
warhead, the TN75. Thus renovated, the French strategic ocean 
force will comprise, by unanimous opinion, a tool for deterrence 
whose reliability can be guaranteed for the next 10 years. 
  In this context, what question should the politicians in 
charge be asking? In my opinion, the immediate development of 
the M5 is the most serious mistake that could be made in the 
drafting of the planning law. Not only would it be a mistake in 
technological terms, but also in budgetary, strategic, and 
therefore political terms. 
  Technologically, the gain in performance attributed to the 
future missile -- and the gain which is likely to be achieved -- 
concerns range, accuracy, payload, and stealth. So far, 
however, this improved missile is felt to go hand in hand with a 
new warhead, the TN100, which is already in the design stage at 
the Atomic Energy Commission. This load will yield enhanced 
performance in terms of penetration and accuracy. 
  Is all this so very urgent? This does, it is true, represent 
decisive progress, but in only one area: The enhanced range 
"gives water" to submarines, i.e., it allows them to patrol in 
warm waters and to increase their potential and safety. 
However, as for the rest, there are a great many contradictions 
and uncertainties in the process! 
<H5>  Contradiction </H5>
  We are increasing the surface of the targeted objective, 
while at the same time a consensus is emerging for moving away 
from a "city-oriented" doctrine of deterrence toward a doctrine 
based on the destruction of forces, in other words one that is 
more "targeted" and sophisticated. We are increasing the volume 
and payload of the missile's warhead, while every indicator 
points to a constant move toward nuclear warheads which are 
smaller in volume and weight, but which have equal strength. 
This is even one of France's specialties. Moreover, we are 
implementing a new armaments system based on the TN100 -- a 
warhead that is innovative in terms of design and operation -- 
at a time when we are suspending nuclear tests and when, as a 
result, we are banning the validation of its design and 
development, and therefore the verification of the sought-after 
results. 
  To get around this contradiction, it is said that the 
current 
TN75 warhead, which will soon be in service, can be improved and 
adapted to the new M5 missile. This weakens the rhetoric and 
the deterrence. We find ourselves involved in an approach based 
on opportunity and not efficiency. Such opportunism has 
characterized the M5 missile since its birth and places a 
terrible financial burden on the defense budget and planning law. 
  It is estimated that the M5 missile alone, without its 
nuclear warhead, will cost around 65 billion francs. Its launch 
was announced to the Aerospatiale group in January 1992 -- two 
months before the last legislative elections -- in a letter from 
the defense minister (Pierre Joxe). This baptism may appear 
blighted with some suspicion of electioneering, even if I do not 
ignore the problematically low order load of Aerospatiale's 
"strategic missiles" division. 
  Yet, was the military staff in favor of this? Was a decision 
made in the Defense Council? 
  At the same time, the Defense Ministry published a 
"reference 
document" on planning, the stand-in for the law that was not 
discussed in Parliament. This "reference document" clearly 
showed that merely pursuing the irreversible programmes already 
under way would put too much pressure on the budget capacity in 
the medium term. Of course, funding allocated to the M5 missile 
in the 1993 budget was low, and it will be equally low in 1994. 
However, what will become of the new planning law if program 
authorizations have to be increased in the short term? We thus 
deprive the law of any maneuvering room, unless one major 
ongoing project is canceled. And who will take that risk? 
<H5>  Deterrence Thwarted </H5>
  Consequently, we are blocking the development of our 
deterrence strategy. This development, which now enjoys broad 
consensus within the Armed Forces and the majority, is imposed 
by geopolitical upheavals. 
  We know the broad outlines of this consensus. Submarines are 
an important -- if not key -- strategic element in our defense 
apparatus, but the search for greater flexibility and improved 
adaptation to the new context has led to the implementation of a 
second airborne "component" fitted with the LRAS (long-range 
air-to-surface) missile. This "component" would have strike 
capacities for a second and final warning. 
  At the same time, the discussion of the implementation of 
antimissile protection is necessary in our country. From now 
on, Aerospatiale -- despite the defection of the British over 
the LRAS -- is in a position to develop missiles capable of 
stopping ballistic missiles at mid-altitude. In addition, the 
company alone can equip France with a long-range air-to-surface 
missile. 
  All this will be made financially impossible by the further 
development of the M5 missile. This missile will destroy what 
little flexibility a sustained budgetary effort could give to 
the planning law. 
  It is here that we meet up with politics again. The trap 
which the president of the republic has just set for the 
government and its majority was laid out in a sentence spoken in 
an interview given to AFP by Francois Mitterrand (LE MONDE of 11 
January). He spoke of a "new missile which comprises a major 
improvement, namely in terms of range, and which could also be 
installed on the Albion platform." 
  So here is the M5 destroying the entire planning with all 
its 
might. Here is the compromised strategic development, the 
second weakened nuclear "component," and the antiballistic 
protection system postponed indefinitely. Here, lastly, is the 
Albion platform put back in the saddle and the "sanctuarization" 
of the reactivated territory. 
  Such a regression in our nuclear strategy is inconceivable. 
Or perhaps we are to think that Mr. Mitterrand, who came to 
power with a strong prejudice against deterrence, will leave his 
post by depriving his successor of this powerful tool, after he 
himself made use of it. The halting of nuclear testing and the 
fate of the M5 make one wonder. My feeling is that it would be 
desirable to stagger the implementation of the M5 in order to 
give France some latitude in adapting its strategy and equipping 
its forces for a new and dangerous world that is now emerging.

  [Text] Geneva, Feb 18 (AFP) -- The International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) stepped up its campaign to have blinding 
laser weapons banned by international convention. 
  ICRC legal adviser Louise Doswald-Beck told a press 
conference that "civilisation would take a step backwards if it 
tolerated such weapons," which could blind a person irreversibly 
at a distance of one kilometre (1,000 yards). 
  Presenting a 300 page report of experts engaged by the ICRC 
since 1991, Beck said "the laser weapon is silent, its ray is 
invisible and its effect is instantaneous." 
  The ICRC wants the weapon banned when the 1980 Geneva 
Convention is reviewed at the end of this year. 
  Doswald-Beck said individual shoulder-fired laser weapons 
costing just $100 were already being tested in the United States 
and could go into production next year. 
  The British specialist magazine JANE'S DEFENCE WEEKLY 
revealed in 1990 that laser weapons were used by the Royal Navy 
against Argentine pilots during the 1982 Falkland War and could 
have caused the unexplained crash of three aircraft. 
  The ICRC also wants much tighter control on the use of anti- 
personnel mines which tend to kill more civilians than 
combatants.

<F P=106> [Leonid Mlechin report: "New Generation of Lasers Could </F>
Soon Enter Various Armies' Arsenals"] 
  [Text] The International Red Cross Committee in Geneva has 
appealed to the United States and Britain, urging that the 
development of laser weapons, which can blind a person, be 
stopped. 
  The Red Cross is hoping to obtain a formal UN ban on the 
development and production of laser weapons. They are silent 
and invisible weapons. A person does not know that a laser is 
being aimed at him and has no time to prepare himself and 
somehow protect himself. 
  Laser weapons are an object of desire for all armies' 
generals. Several attempts to provide themselves with the combat 
lasers featured in science fiction novels have been dashed 
against the immutable laws of physics. In order to make a laser 
beam capable of burning through something it must be focused: 
This is impossible at long distances because of the law of 
diffraction. But it is also impossible to kill enemy soldiers or 
destroy his armored vehicles at short distances using modern 
lasers. So far lasers have found a use in high-precision 
weapons guidance systems. 
  According to information available to the Red Cross, a new 
generation of lasers could soon enter Western armies' arsenals. 
At a 1km radius such a weapon, Red Cross specialists claim, 
could permanently blind a person. One of the aims is to blind 
aircrew. The Geneva committee also fears that portable and 
easy-to-use combat lasers could fall into the hands of 
terrorists. 
  The demand to stop the development of laser weapons will 
make 
life difficult not only for the United States but also for 
Russia, which has overtaken the West in the development of 
lasers for terrestrial and space use. Millions of what were 
then noninflationary rubles went on attempts to develop lasers 
to destroy satellites and ballistic missiles in space. 
  Tracked laser guns were developed by the "Luch" central 
design bureau and then the "Astrofizika" science and production 
association, which was led by Nikolay Ustinov, son of Dmitriy 
Ustinov, Central Committee secretary for the military industry 
and later defense minister. In 20 years 200 million rubles were 
spent and a dozen vulnerable tracked monsters which had no 
chance on the battlefield were constructed. 
  Under Gorbachev work to improve the monster was halted. 
According to IZVESTIYA reports work was recently resumed. 
Possibly the generals are unable to abandon their long-standing 
dream. Maybe physics research is not standing still and there 
will be new opportunities to decrease the dimensions of combat 
lasers and make them cheaper. Their task is to disable the 
enemy's optical guidance instruments and blind operators. When 
enemy positions are illuminated by a laser beam the electronic 
optical guidance systems (of an aircraft, missile launcher, 
tank, artillery piece, or firearm) will themselves focus this 
beam and be disabled. If at this moment the operator is looking 
through the guidance instrument's eyepiece he will lose his 
sight.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Work for Russian Nuclear </F>
Experts"] 
  [Text] Three thousand Russian nuclear experts, previously 
working on nuclear weapons, could soon be employed at an 
institute for scientific and technological research in Moscow, 
paid for by the West and Japan. They would thus be switching to 
projects for the peaceful use of nuclear power and better 
protection for Russia's nuclear power stations. 
  Yesterday evening the European Parliament in Strasbourg gave 
the go-ahead for the founding of such an institute, by 
unanimously voting for a provisional protocol. This was 
required because the Russian Parliament, the Douma, was not able 
to ratify the agreement with the European Union, the United 
States, and Japan as a result of the stormy political events in 
Moscow. 
  During a debate in Strasbourg yesterday, the Dutch member of 
Parliament Jessica Larive (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
democracy]), European Parliament rapporteur on founding the new 
center in Moscow, referred to an urgent need to stop the 
braindrain from Russia of nuclear scientists who were all 
employed under the Soviet system on the production and 
maintenance of nuclear weapons. So far 500 have already left, 
possibly to suspected countries such as Iraq, Libya and Iran, 
plus the nuclear power China. 
  Between 1971 and 1993 some 700,000 people lived in the 10 
secret nuclear towns. Larive believes most of them are still 
there. But they no longer enjoy the former privileges such as 
high wages, free housing and education, and there are problems 
with food supplies. There is no other employment for the nuclear 
technicians, as they are bound to secrecy by the Russian 
Government. The hard core of 500 scientists with knowledge of 
the Soviet system for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons 
can now be employed on peaceful projects in Moscow. The 
European Union, the United States, and Japan have so far set 
aside some 126 million guilders for the center. Russia has even 
made a Moscow building available.

  [Text] Dismantling the nuclear warheads being withdrawn 
from the territory of Ukraine is an issue which is causing grave 
concern to those involved in the protection of the environment. 
The processing of radioactive materials may cause serious 
damage to the environment. Today, we learned that warheads from 
the Ukrainian missiles are being sent to the town of Arzamas-16. 
Viktor Danilov- Danilyan, the Minister of Natural Resources: 
  [Begin Danilov-Danilyan recording] Only to Arzamas-16. It is 
the enterprise that specializes in these particular things. 
From the point of view of the general safety of Russia it is 
better to bring Ukrainian warheads to Russia, to dismantle them 
and process what they contain, rather than to leave them in 
Ukraine. My honest word; this is better. If another incident 
should occur there, consequences will be far greater than from 
Chernobyl. (end recording)

  [Text] Moscow, March 2 (AFP) -- Ukraine has transferred to 
Russia some 60 strategic nuclear warheads in accordance with a 
treaty that calls for the Ukraine to dismantle its nuclear 
arsenal, the SEGODNYA newspaper reported Wednesday. 
  The paper, quoting what it said were highly reliable 
sources, 
said the warheads were loaded on a special train that was to 
arrive Wednesday in a city in the Caucasus where the weapons 
will be transferred to the factory where they were assembled. 
  A spokesman for the ministry of defense here denied the 
report saying "that no nuclear warheads have left the Ukraine 
for the moment." 
  SEGODNYA said that the weapons' transfer comes at a time 
when 
Russia and the U.S. need to improve relations following tension 
between the two stemming from a spy scandal involving a former 
top CIA official who has been charged with spying for Moscow.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report under the "Disarmament" rubric: </F>
"Evacuation of Warheads From Ukraine Begins. The First Tangible 
Result of Russian-American Partnership"] 
  [Text] Ironically, the first, really serious result of the 
Russian-American strategic partnership was achieved precisely at 
a time when the authorities in Washington and Moscow are once 
again, as in the glorious years of the Cold War, expelling 
diplomats, accusing each other of spying, at a time when 
bilateral relations in general are at the freezing point. 
  The counselors-cum-spies, Aleksandr Lysenko and James 
Morris, 
were packing their bags and packages as Ukrainian warheads were 
already heading for Russia. SEGODNYA has learned from more than 
reliable sources that Russia and Ukraine have finally gotten 
around to implementing in practice the 
Russian-American-Ukrainian trilateral agreement "On the Terms 
and Conditions of Eliminating Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons in 
Ukraine," which was signed in Moscow 14 January by Boris 
Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Bill Clinton. 
  Under the agreement, in the last days of February the first 
60 warheads removed from strategic missiles in service with the 
46th (Pervomayskaya) Missile Division of the 43d Missile Army 
were loaded on specially equipped flatcars of a special-purpose 
train and sent to Russia. Today, the train with the special 
cargo is to arrive in a closed city run by the Atomic Energy 
Ministry (former Medium Engineering Ministry) in the Urals, in 
the plant where the warheads had once been assembled. Now they 
will be dismantled. There are still, of course, around 2,000 
nuclear warheads remaining in Ukraine, but now there is hope 
that this problem will finally be resolved. 
  It will be resolved first of all by joint efforts of Russian 
and American politicians and diplomats who have managed to 
convince President Kravchuk that the nuclear warheads, which 
Ukraine can neither service, use, nor safely store on its own 
will not bring Ukraine security or profits. 
  We can expect that the first real success may hold up 
further 
worsening in Russian-American relations. Apart from friendly 
rhetoric, the strategic partnership does have a stable 
foundation, albeit a nuclear-missile one. The nuclear threat 
once helped to avert a third world war. Let us hope now that it 
will prevent Russian-American relations from taking too drastic 
turns in their course.

  [Text] A high-ranking Russian military official told 
Interfax on Wednesday that Russia was to begin the withdrawal of 
strategic missiles from Ukraine at the beginning of March. He 
also said that the first lot consisted of 60 warheads removed 
from the strategic missiles of the 46th missile division and 
43rd missile army. There are about 2,000 nuclear warheads in 
Ukraine. 
  He expressed satisfaction that Moscow and Kiev had found a 
political solution of this problem. He also said that delays in 
the withdrawal of the strategic nuclear weapons were due to the 
unpreparedness of corresponding documents. He believes that 
after the necessary papers are prepared by the Ukrainian customs 
and other agencies, there would be no further delays.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- A senior official of the 
Russian Defence Ministry denied press reports that dozens of 
nuclear charges from Ukraine had arrived for dismantling to an 
enterprise in the Urals in Russia. 
  The report "does not correspond to reality and is wishful 
thinking of reporters," General Vitaliy Yakovlev told TASS on 
Thursday commenting on a Wednesday report of the "SEGONYA" daily. 
  "No train with nuclear charges has departed from the 
neighbouring country to Russia so far," he added, but expressed 
hope that Ukraine's nuclear disarmament will begin soon. 
  Ukraine pledged to give up its nuclear weapons under an 
agreement signed with Russia and the United States in Moscow in 
January. 
  According to Yakovlev, there are nearly 2,000 nuclear 
charges 
in Ukraine at present. Their safety level causes great concern 
of experts and delays in their transportation to Russia can 
result in unpredictable consequences, he warned. 
  Russia guarantees to Ukraine safety of all work during 
transportation and scrapping of the nuclear weapons, according 
to the general.

  [Text] Russia has delivered no nuclear fuel for Ukrainian 
nuclear power stations since the time Ukraine, Russia and the 
U.S.A. signed an agreement in Moscow. First Deputy Chairman of 
the Ukrainian State Committee on Nuclear Power Nur Nigmatullin 
told Interfax-Ukraine that the document was supposed to be 
supplemented by inter-governmental agreements. "They have been 
drafted and are under discussion but the deliveries will not 
arrive until the agreements are signed," Nigmatullin explained. 
  The fuel will be supplied at a price of $600,000 to $700,000 
per fuel element for VVER-1000 reactors as compensation for 
warheads that will be sent to Russia for destruction. The 
Ukrainian nuclear power stations need 550 elements a year. 
  Nigmatullin said that the fuel supplied as compensation will 
last three to four years. "At the moment the Ukrainian nuclear 
power stations have a supply of fuel until May of June 1994," he 
added.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Disarmament" column: "The </F>
Fate of the Nuclear Train Is Again at a Dead End. This Time in 
a Railway Siding"] 
  [Text] Ukraine has suspended the evacuation of nuclear 
warheads to Russia. As SEGODNYA reported in its 2 March issue, 
60 "Ukrainian" nuclear warheads dismantled from the strategic 
missiles of the 46th (Pervomayskaya) Missile Division of the 43d 
Missile Army were delivered to embarkation points on flatcars of 
a special high- security train. But then everything stopped 
going according to plan: the train did not arrive at its 
destination -- the "electromechanical" plant in a closed town 
run by the Atomic Industry Ministry in the Urals region where 
nuclear charges are assembled (and dismantled).... 
  It will be recalled that on 14 January a tripartite 
Russian-U.S.- Ukrainian agreement was signed in Moscow on 
conditions for the liquidation of Ukrainian nuclear weapons in 
Ukraine. In subsequent weeks, experts on both sides prepared a 
coordinated schedule for the evacuation of the nuclear warheads. 
Specialists of the Russian Defense Ministry's 12th Main 
Directorate managed (with the assistance of the Ukrainian 
military) to resolve all technical problems within an early 
period. The warheads were delivered to the embarkation point 
and prepared for shipment. 
  The Ukrainian side, however, suddenly suspended the 
withdrawal, demanding confirmation that the Russian Atomic 
Industry Ministry will in March supply to Ukraine fuel 
assemblies for its nuclear power plants in exchange for the 
warheads. Ukraine badly needs nuclear fuel, with its power 
industry being on the verge of closure. But so far there has 
been no confirmation from Moscow about nuclear fuel supplies. 
Therefore the Ukrainian side also put on hold the loading of 
warheads because it is not at all safe to keep nuclear munitions 
"on wheels." 
  Meanwhile the Ukrainian president has begun his visit to 
Washington. Earlier it was expected that Leonid Kravchuk would 
report to President Clinton about the start of real 
implementation of the 14 January agreement which was apparently 
supposed to raise Kiev's prospects of getting U.S. economic 
assistance. At the end of February, however, the general 
atmosphere of Russian-U.S. relations changed: the Ames case, 
followed by mutual deportation of diplomats and the demands in 
Congress to freeze U.S. aid to Russia.... Kiev must have 
concluded that the orientation of U.S. foreign policy is 
changing and now there will be no direct linkage between 
economic assistance and the nuclear issue -- and the time has 
finally come for Ukraine also to show firmness in its relations 
with Moscow. 
  True, Moscow is behaving far from impeccably. To date the 
question about who will pay for fuel deliveries has not been 
settled. The Atomic Industry Ministry cannot just present fuel 
assemblies from its stocks to Ukraine as a gift: people in 
closed cities are also experiencing difficulties over the 
nonpayment of wages. As a result, the military just sits 
waiting with its dangerous, restless cargo until the politicians 
have figured out what has to come first, "the money or the 
goodies." Meanwhile the Russian Gazprom has already started to 
cut gas supplies to Ukraine, and this can hardly improve the 
general atmosphere of deep mutual distrust between Moscow and 
Kiev.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Ukrainian Nuclear Disarmament Has </F>
Begun"] 
  [Text] An event of which there has so long been so much 
talk in the capitals of three major world states -- Washington, 
Moscow, and Kiev -- has finally happened: Russia and Ukraine 
have begun implementing the trilateral accord signed in the 
Kremlin 14 January on the partial transfer of the nuclear 
warheads of strategic missiles and of strategic bomber cruise 
missiles to Russian territory for subsequent dismantling and 
salvaging. 
  They are not revealing the details of the current operation, 
its schedule, or the size of the transfers, citing the secrecy 
and security requirements stipulated in a special document. But 
independent experts maintain that the secret [liternyy] trains 
taking the nuclear warheads out of Ukraine must be taking 
several dozen warheads previously removed from SS-19 liquid-fuel 
strategic missiles of the 43d Missile Army's 46th Missile 
Division, which are in a pre-malfunction state. 
  Special cars are bringing elements for Ukrainian nuclear 
electric power stations to meet these trains. 
  According to information at the disposal of the editorial 
office, at least some 200 strategic missile warheads are to be 
removed from Ukrainian territory to Russian plants during the 10 
months of this year. In return Ukraine will receive by way of 
compensation, as a first real step, 100 tonnes of slightly 
enriched uranium in the form of those very fuel assemblies for 
its nuclear power industry. 
  It is no coincidence that these March days have been 
selected 
to start the removal of nuclear warheads from Ukrainian 
territory. At the time the secret train crossed Russia's border 
with specific weapons and headed deep into the country, toward 
the plants where they will be dismantled and salvaged, Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk was meeting with Bill Clinton. He had 
something to report in Washington. 
  The trilateral Moscow accord is being fulfilled. This 
attests that Kiev and Moscow are serious about the obligations 
they have assumed.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 6 Mar -- The first train loaded with the 
nuclear warheads of missiles situated on Ukrainian territory 
crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border early this morning. It is 
on its way to enterprises in Russia where this dangerous cargo 
will be dismantled and subsequently reprocessed and destroyed. 
An ITAR-TASS correspondent was informed of this by a 
top-ranking expert who wished to remain anonymous. 
  The expert believes that the movement of the trains carrying 
these nuclear warheads is being linked in a number of Russian 
ministries with the start of the practical implementation of the 
trilateral Russo-American-Ukrainian agreements on the 
liquidation of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine, which were signed 
in Moscow in January of this year. 
  Under the agreement, Russia has undertaken to deliver to 
Ukraine fuel for its nuclear power stations in exchange for the 
nuclear warheads, but not in the form of reprocessed nuclear 
material from the missiles that have been removed. According to 
the expert, it will take a long time to reprocess it, from 
several months to a year. Fuel for the Ukrainian nuclear power 
plants will be exchanged for fuel from Russia's reserves. 
  In reply to a question by the ITAR-TASS correspondent about 
help to Ukraine from Japan in eliminating nuclear weapons, the 
expert noted that international practice shows that nuclear 
weapons should be dismantled by whoever stockpiled them. The 
Russian side is capable of removing all nuclear warheads on the 
territory of Ukraine in the course of a year for dismantling 
subsequently at the enterprises where they were produced. The 
expert said that what may be at issue is help from Japanese 
specialists in secondary work, in particular, on dismantling 
silos. 
  Acording to reports from ITAR-TASS correspondents from 
Yekaterinburg, Cherlyabinsk, and Tomsk, a number of specialist 
enterprises in these cities do not rule out the possibility that 
they may get the Ukrainian consignment. They are ready to 
receive it there. Russian nuclear experts also guarantee the 
Ukrainian side that all work in the process of removing and 
recovering strategic weapons will be carried out safely. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent has been told by a duty officer 
at 
one of the main directorates of the Russian Ministry of Railways 
that, under the conditions of the tripartite agreement between 
Russia, the United States, and Ukraine, the route of the trains 
carrying the Ukrainian nuclear warheads is not to be disclosed. 
According to him, special strict security measures are observed 
on Russian railways when cargoes of this kind are transported. 
  According to the Russian Defense Ministry, there are about 
1300 warheads for intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBM), 
more than 600 warheads for air-launched cruise missiles and 176 
IBM missile launchers, including 130 SS-19 and 46 SS-24 
launchers, on Ukrainian territory. The state of nuclear safety 
in Ukraine causes particular concern to specialists and delays 
in withdrawing and dismantling them are fraught with 
unpredictable consequences. In particular, the guarantee period 
has expired for most warheads, and no maintenance is being 
carried out. Some weapons are on the point of posing a danger. 
The situation is being aggravated by the fact that there are 
not enough specialists in Ukraine to monitor the safety of 
nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> ["agt, hau" report: "Ukraine Demands Natural Gas for </F>
Nuclear Disarmament"] 
  [Excerpts] Moscow/Vienna -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk has linked his country's renunciation of nuclear 
weapons to the continuation of Russian natural gas deliveries to 
his country. In an interview for CIS television, he stated on 
Saturday evening [5 March] that fulfilling all agreements is 
possible only if the economy works. 
  Regardless of these threats, the Russian state corporation 
Gasprom continued to strongly reduce its deliveries to Ukraine 
on the weekend. Currently Ukraine is (still) fulfilling its 
obligations for disarmament. Yesterday, Sunday, a transport of 
nuclear warheads arrived in Russia, which are to be destroyed 
there in line with the agreements. [passage omitted] 
  The Ukrainian economy needs particularly large amounts of 
natural gas and oil from Russia. In an interview with DER 
STANDARD, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yuliy Ioffe said that 
Ukraine used 119 billion cubic meters of natural gas last year. 
Given Ukraine's own production of about 29 billion cubic 
meters, he said that the country had to import 90 billion cubic 
meters. 
  Since Russia is delivering only in exchange for hard foreign 
currency within the CIS, Ukraine's debts have multiplied, even 
though the dollar has been set at an exchange rate favorable for 
Ukraine. Gasprom foreign spokesman Nikolay Belyi told DER 
STANDARD last week that Ukraine owes his corporation 1.5 
trillion rubles (between $1.2 and $1.5 billion dollars).

  [Text] The Ukrainian president's statement as to the 
impossibility of implementing nuclear disarmament agreements if 
Russian gas supplies are stopped does not reflect "confrontation 
or intention to raise this issue sharply," Deputy Premier 
Valeriy Shmarov told Interfax-Ukraina. 
  On Saturday, in the course of his visit to the USA, Leonid 
Kravchuk told journalists that a stoppage of Ukrainian plants 
and factories because of gas shortages is real, and that it may 
jeopardize the implementation of all the previous accords, 
including the agreement concerning nuclear disarmament. 
  According to Shmarov, "the president hinted that, if 
economic 
pressure is brought to bear on Ukraine, the expectation that all 
of the country's resources will be accumulated to accomplish 
that task would be futile." 
  "So far we have requested Russia to raise supplies to the 
fixed level -- 100-105 million cubic meters a day," Shmarov 
said. "At the same time we urged local governments to halt gas 
supplies to plants and factories in order to give gas to the 
populace to hold out till the cold ends." 
  Shmarov believes that Russia's actions connected with 
reduced 
gas supplies have no political tinge. The Gasprom is a 
joint-stock society, and our debt should be paid to it," he said. 
  The deputy premier confirmed the reports that the first 
train 
carrying nuclear warheads crossed Ukraine's border with Russia 
on Saturday. According to him, in a cable sent to the Ukrainian 
government, Russia's Premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin, "guaranteed 
to ensure nuclear fuel supplies in accordance with our 
understanding within March." 
  As Shmarov said, early this year Russia delivered a 
consignment of fuel for the nuclear-power plant in Chernobyl, 
but that fuel was delivered under the "goods against money" 
scheme. 
  Under the agreement concerning Ukraine's nuclear 
disarmament, 
Russia supplies nuclear fuel in exchange for nuclear warheads 
only for the nuclear-power plants in Zaporozhye, Rovny and 
Southern Ukraine. 
  "Another consignment of nuclear warheads is being prepared 
to 
be despatched from Ukraine," Shmarov said. However it will be 
despatched "only if we see adequate actions on the part of 
Russia," he added.

  [Text] A second train, carrying 60 nuclear warheads of 
strategic rockets stationed in Ukraine, is expected to leave the 
Khmelnitskiy railroad station for Russia at 20:20 Moscow time 
Wednesday. An informed source in the Russian Defense Ministry 
told Interfax that the warheads would be sent to a factory in 
the Sverdlovsk Region for dismantling. 
  The first trainload of 60 warheads had left the city of 
Pervomaisk for Russia on March 4. 
  A total of nearly 2000 nuclear warheads remain in Ukraine in 
the hands of the 46th Rocketry Division stationed in Pervomayisk 
and the 43rd Rocketry Army stationed in Khmelnitskiy. 
  Meanwhile, officials in the Russian Nuclear Energy Ministry 
told Interfax that 120 heating elements had been sent by one of 
the Elektrostal, Moscow Region, factory to the Chernobyl nuclear 
power station at the expense of the Russian government.

  [Text] Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov 
declined to confirm reports that a second train loaded with 
nuclear munitions had left Ukraine for Russia on March 9. 
  "Information of this kind is extremely confidential as 
shipping such freights entails necessary security measures," he 
told Interfax-Ukraine. 
  "It would be desirable if people handling these processes on 
both sides did not create tense situations in future," Shmarov 
said. He added that "professionals did their best to ensure the 
security of the shipment and make sure the freight arrives at 
its destination by the shortest possible route." 
  Ukraine has not received nuclear fuel from Russia as 
envisioned in the trilateral statement by the U.S., Ukrainian 
and Russian presidents. The only thing the Ukrainian leadership 
received was a telegram from Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin stating that the Russian government would start the 
supplies before the end of this month.

  [Text] Here is some information we have received from 
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. It is a statement with the 
following content: 
  Recently Russia's mass media, in particular Interfax and the 
SEGODNYA newspaper have been circulating information about the 
dispatch from Ukraine's territory of special trains carrying 
nuclear warheads which are to be handed over to the Russian side 
in accordance with Ukraine's international obligations. At the 
same time, with reference to informed sources in the Russian 
Federation's Ministry of Defense, data of a strictly 
confidential nature is being broadcast. 
  The ease with which some journalists, referring to the 
Russian military, disseminate information throughout the world 
on the times, dates, and destinations of the trains carrying 
nuclear warheads evokes surprise, especially as Russian 
specialists cannot but acknowledge the fact that such actions 
create a real threat to the safety of the transportation of 
nuclear warheads. 
  Ukraine's Ministry of Defense Press Service states that such 
actions are provocative and inadmissible because they are 
directed at creating a new spiral of tension around Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament. Because of the lack of discipline among 
Russian information sources, Ukraine is now forced to make 
additional adjustments to the schedule and routes for the 
transportation of nuclear warheads.

  [Text] According to Associated Press, Ukraine has announced 
that it is suspending the dispatch to Russia of nuclear warheads 
from missiles on its territory. 
  The agency cites a Ukrainian Defense Ministry statement 
issued on Friday. Justifying this step, the Ukrainian ministry 
has accused the Russian media of disseminating confidential 
information on the transportation of the warheads from the 
Ukrainian territory into Russia. This is seen by the Ukrainian 
military as a threat to the safety of the nuclear materials due 
to be transported. 
  It was earlier reported that the first nuclear trainload 
arrived in Russia last Sunday.

  [Text] A member of the Russian parliament has denied recent 
reports in some of Moscow's newspapers that Kazakhstan and 
Ukraine have a secret agreement on the joint use of the Baykonur 
space- vehicle launching complex. 
  Konstantin Zatulin told a news conference in Almaty, where 
he 
had been monitoring the parliamentary elections as an 
international observer, that Russia and Kazakhstan were going to 
enter into a treaty on the further use of Baykonur. The 
document was due to be signed by the two countries' presidents 
in Moscow on March 30, he said. 
  Commenting on a meeting he had with Kazakh Deputy Prime 
Minister Yerik Asanbayev, Zatulin said Kazakhstan's leadership 
preferred not to bring up the dual citizenship issue, but that 
the next parliament might consider giving Russian the status of 
an official language.

strategic nuclear forces equipped with non-targeted missiles. 
  As INTERFAX learned at the presidential press service, the 
decree is aimed at implementing the Moscow Declaration signed by 
the Russian and U.S. presidents on January 14 and the joint 
statement by the Russian president and the British premier of 
February 15. 
  These documents said that Russian nuclear missiles will no 
longer be targeted against the USA and Great Britain. 
  By another decree Boris Yeltsin set up a commission on 
supreme military ranks and high military and specialized schools 
of the Presidential Council for Personnel Policy. The Russian 
presidential aide for national security Yury Baturin was 
appointed as the chairman of the commission, the presidential

<F P=106> [Article by Lev Fedorov, doctor of chemical sciences: "From </F>
Chemical Warfare to Ecological Warfare"] 
  [Text] SPASENIYE Reference Information -- Doctor of 
Chemical Sciences Lev Fedorov is president of the Alliance for 
Chemical Safety. The friend and comrade-in-arms of Vil 
Mirzayanov, he has traveled this fighter's entire journey -- 
from social persecution to KGB interrogations. Whereas we might 
stretch things to believe that the persecution of political 
dissidents is over, attempts continue to be made, as before, to 
nail "industrial" dissidents to the wall. 
  In mid-October, at their first assembly in Nizhniy Novgorod, 
a small group of activists of the antichemical movement founded 
the Alliance for Chemical Safety. Our organization is not very 
large at present, and certainly not widespread. However, we 
would like to make a beginning. We cannot allow the 
military-chemical complex, whose inclinations for poaching have 
long been well known, to make decisions regarding Russia's 
withdrawal from chemical warfare without consulting us -- the 
inhabitants of Russia. 
  I would like to invite into discussion (and into action!) 
the 
populace of those regions in which the chemical weapons of the 
land of the soviets have been stored in recent years at seven 
bases, and from which their continued journey can lead to just 
one destination -- nonexistence. We are addressing first and 
foremost those people who reside near three air bases and two 
artillery bases that store chemical munitions with the most 
toxic organophosphoric nerve-paralysis agents -- zarin, zoman, 
and V-gas. 
  The air bases housing chemicals were situated at three quite 
tranquil localities in Russia -- the city of Pochel (Bryansk 
Oblast), and the settlements of Leonidovka (Penza Oblast) and 
Maradykovskiy (Kirov Oblast). Protected here from impudent 
"hostile" eyes are various types of air-dropped bombs, molded 
aviation devices, components for all-purpose containers, and 
other "riches" we have no need for. 
  The chemical arsenals at rocket artillery bases were 
comfortably positioned in the settlement of Kizner (Udmurtia) 
and in the city of Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast). At one time 
chemical projectiles for tube and rocket artillery and warheads 
for missiles of various ranges were transported here. 
  None of us is guilty of what is the reality today. Those who 
dragged Russia into chemical warfare and accumulated stockpiles 
of chemical weapons preferred to remain in obscurity and can 
hardly be expected now to come out into the spotlight. No more 
deserving of trust, however, is the current wave of 
military-chemical establishment people, who are again attempting 
to take charge of something, this time -- the destruction of 
chemical weapons. And once again -- without us, although at the 
expense of our health and our interests. It seems these people 
are about to drag us out of chemical warfare and into ecological 
warfare without proper supervision on the part of society. 
  The sad story is that our chemical weapons stockpiles will 
have to be eliminated "in their storage locations" (KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA, 22 October 1993). This was acknowledged by General A.D. 
Kuntsevich, head of the "eliminators," and a zealous and not 
unselfish creator of our military-chemical offensive 
"achievements" (we are not talking about defensive arms here) in 
the past. And it is even more important that we not give sloppy 
people from the military-chemical complex complete freedom of 
discretion in managing this matter of greatest danger. Their 
thoughtlessness and lack of professionalism could well deliver 
us many new calamities. 
  In order to provide a convincing basis for the fears I am 
expressing here, I cite the interview, just published, with 
Colonel A.D. Gorbovskiy (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 27 January 1994). 
It is out of pure necessity that I provide the name of this 
gentleman -- he deserves no publicity. 
  As the head of some military-chemical inspection team, the 
colonel recently made a calculation of the amount of toxic 
substances Russia has on hand. It is suspicious that this amount 
coincided exactly with the figure officially declared previously 
-- 40,000 tonnes, and not a tonne more. Of course, the gentleman 
simply forgot to inform us as to what happened to the remaining 
tonnes which used to exist and were a topic of discussion. 
Which, by the way, are not a bit less toxic in the buried or 
submerged state than they are in the combat configuration -- 
when stored in the form of chemical munitions. 
  We go on; there is more. In his capacity as head of this 
inspection team, the colonel assured his fellow citizens, first 
and foremost the residents of the above-mentioned population 
centers, that the chemical munitions in their locality were 
being stored safely, and that "no instances of leakage of toxic 
substances have been recorded" at any of the arsenals. Well, 
suppose there is no automatic alarm system whatsoever at the 
bases in the city of Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast) and settlement of 
Kizner (Udmurtia) to signal the presence of toxic vapors in the 
atmosphere. And there never was! So it would seem that nothing 
exists to do the recording, especially when the soldier is 
sleeping and a "leak" is occurring. Things are not much better 
at the other bases. Thus, it is hardly worth talking so 
categorically about leaks. Especially since the environmental 
protection organs and sanitation and epidemiologic services of 
these localities are not allowed to get involved here -- 
"ecologists" in uniform are in charge. 
  No less interesting is the geographic aspect of the 
colonel's 
revelations. Once again, in his capacity as head of the 
inspection team, he "shut down" altogether the rocket artillery 
arsenal in the city of Shchuchye, announcing that all of our 
storage facilities "are located in the European part of Russia" 
and that "the most eastern" facility was situated in Chelyabinsk 
Oblast. I do not know whether or not there are in fact chemical 
weapons in the city of Shchuchye, but such an announcement was 
officially made (IZVESTIYA, 3 November 1992), and it was 
released following General Kuntsevich's optimistic speech 
delivered to committees of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet 
before it was burned down. 
  Finally, they are again trying to drag us into "speeding 
things up." The colonel acknowledges that the buildings housing 
our chemical munitions ensure reliable storage over an extended 
period of time. At the same time, his energetic complaints about 
the intractability of his fellow citizens arouse suspicion. It 
turns out that, because of a predilection for adequate 
resolution of ecological problems, Russia "will be unable to 
effect timely implementation of the program" for chemical 
weapons destruction. But why should Russia do anything at all 
that is to the detriment of its citizens? 
  In this regard, we must pause and raise a question to be 
dealt with before we can proceed further. We know that the 
American program of chemical weapons destruction emerged 
following, and as a result of, a 20-year debate between the 
military and people residing in the vicinity of the bases for 
the storage (and destruction) of chemical weapons. Residents met 
the military halfway only after being convinced of the absolute 
safety of the technology of destruction, not to mention 
everyday, purely economic interests. It was only after attaining 
a consensus with its populace that the United States embarked 
upon the official signing of the international Convention on 
Chemical Disarmament. 
  Why has not a similar debate begun here? I am thinking not 
only about the citizens of Russia who reside in the vicinity of 
the five above-mentioned bases where the most dangerous toxic 
substances are stored. This problem is a matter of importance to 
all the rest of the population as well. 
  It is all as simple as pie. They continue to consider us 
bystanders. Even those who have lived so close to chemical death 
for decades. 
  Returning to the beginning of this article, I would like to 
emphasize that we can hardly permit ourselves to continue such a 
negligent attitude toward our lives and our environment. Truly, 
these are far more important than the selfish interests of the 
colonels and generals who, originally out of a love for foreign 
travel, were excessively hasty in signing the Convention, and 
who now hasten to implement it with the same fervor. 
  Let us begin to do everything in sequence. Clearly, the 
process of ecologically safe destruction of chemical weapons 
cannot begin without serious -- and critical -- debate. But the 
proper level of debate can be ensured only if the residents of 
regions where the most toxic chemical weapons are stored unite 
in protest groups and define their positions and interests. We 
will not be able to run away from chemical weapons, of course. 
We have been chained to them. We can safeguard our interests, 
however, in the process of preparations for their destruction. 
  It is unimportant whether or not the groups under discussion 
join our alliance or fight independently for their interests. 
What is important is that the interests of people who reside in 
Russia be observed first and foremost when we part from the 
chemical weapons. Incidentally, this position in no way 
contradicts the Convention which was concluded.

<F P=106> [Lev Aleynik report under the "Security" rubric: "Lev </F>
Fedorov Unsure Russia Produces No Chemical Weapons. He Urges 
Investigation Into Military-Chemical Complex Activities"] 
  [Text] Dr. Lev Fedorov has stated that he "would not give 
guarantees" that Russia has totally discontinued the production 
of chemical weapons. These conclusions, according to co-author 
Vil Mirzayanov, are also suggested by the recent splash of 
events connected with "Mirzayanov case" and the reticence of 
officials unwilling to provide the public with details of the 
state of affairs in the military-chemical complex (MCC). 
  Lev Fedorov presented yesterday a report, "Chemical Weapons 
in Russia: History, Ecology, Politics." He stated in a press 
conference that "there are no forces in the government... that 
would regard seriously both the danger posed by the MCC, and the 
safety of the population. The government has not even started 
to solve the problems of getting rid of highly toxic dioxins; 
the questions we raised of elimination of liquid rocket fuel in 
the same class of danger as toxic substances also await 
consideration." 
  Lev Fedorov underlined that he and his colleagues "have so 
far received neither from the army nor industry any precise 
information on where and when they worked in Russia with 
chemical weapons. Society remains unaware of the size of the 
threat to our existence." In the opinion of Mr. Fedorov, people 
in Russia, and elsewhere in the world for that matter, "are 
being denied the opportunity to take an integral look at the 
country's military-chemical past and present: reserved for us 
are miserly crumbs of information. Meanwhile the MCC not only 
exists, but it is also totally unprepared to enter together with 
us into the next millennium; it cannot give up the idea that it 
can no longer hide the costly and highly dangerous chemical 
weapons toy, and that it will not be able to get a free ride on 
this any longer." Lev Fedorov stated that "it is necessary to 
campaign for the full declassification of documents once the 
country's leaders sign the convention renouncing chemical 
weapons, to look into our past and get rid of the old onus of 
secrets."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 5 Mar -- Russia has completed work on 
elaborating the concept of the destruction of toxic chemical 
agents. The elimination of chemical weapons will start after 
parliament has ratified the international convention on the 
destruction of chemical weapons, signed in January 1993, Colonel 
Viktor Kholstov, doctor of chemistry and deputy chief of the 
radiation, chemical, and biological protection troops, told the 
ITAR-TASS corespondent. He said that the convention may come 
into force from January 1995 if 65 world states sign and ratify 
it before this July. 
  According to this document, a signatory undertakes not to 
carry out any new development. Viktor Kholstov stated that 
chemical weapons are not being destroyed anywhere yet. All 
agents are in special arsenals, are well guarded, and do not 
represent a threat to the environment. If munitions become 
defective, V. Kholstov continued, Russia has a unique unit that 
makes it possible to neutralize them. This unit is without 
parallel and was inspected by 40 world delegations who saw for 
themselves how reliable it is. 
  As far as a national program for the elimination of chemical 
weapons is concerned, in Viktor Kholstov's opinion, it is 
necessary both for the adoption of political decisions and to 
substantiate financial outlays. 
  After the convention is ratified, the state is obliged to 
completely destroy over 10 years all chemical weapons on its 
territory, Colonel Kholstov said. This requires special 
facilities and specific financing. Such a draft program was 
drawn up while the USSR still existed, but the implementation of 
the measures it prescribed was thwarted for various reasons. 
For instance, the facility built near Chapayevsk was not made 
operational due to mass protests from the population, which was 
deliberately misinformed by certain groupings for their own ends. 
  The program was taken up again in 1992 after Boris Yeltsin 
stated that Russia had inherited earlier disarmament commitments. 
  Around two dozen ministeries and departments and several 
hundred specialists have been involved in drawing up the new 
version of the program. The government has allocated resources 
for testing the technology, and Russian and American scientists 
and engineers inspected the Chapayevsk facility near Samara for 
safety. 
  Authorative commissions of experts assessed the facility 
highly and recommended that similar facilties be set up in other 
regions of the country. 
  In reply to a question by the ITAR-TASS correspondent as to 
whether new types of chemical weapons were being developed, 
Viktor Kholstov said that nobody would be so brave as to assert 
that no such work was being undertaken abroad. "Russia is not 
violating international agreements, but the strengthening of 
national security lies within its scope just as it does in any 
sovereign, self- respecting state."

  [Text] The volumes of procurements of arms, military 
equipment, and defense scientific and design developments will 
be preserved in 1994 in the volumes determined by the 
government's decision dated last December 21. Interfax has 
learned that this decision was adopted at a conference chaired 
by Russia's First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets on Friday. The 
Finance Ministry was proposed to foresee an appropriate level of 
military order financing before sending the state budget to the 
State Duma. 
  Conference participants pointed out that a sharp reduction 
of 
defense order would result in unrecoverable consequences for the 
country's defense potential and would necessitate social 
compensation payments in accordance with the legislature. As 
participants of the conference note, they will exceed possible 
economy from the reduction of the defense order planned earlier 
by Rbs [Rubles] 2-3 Tn (Trillion]. 
  The conference particularly considered the proposal of the 
First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin on the mechanism 
to end the crisis in defense enterprises, which also produce 
civilian products.

<F P=106> [Report by Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION Defence </F>
Correspondent] 
  [Text] Russia is forging ahead with large-scale research 
into the development of high-tech weapons despite the nation's 
economic crisis. Many of the country's top scientists are 
employed on a wide range of major arms projects, not just to 
boost domestic defence but to capture lucrative overseas sales. 
  And British and Western experts would be anxious to get 
their 
hands on top-secret scientific data. 
  "Weapons research is continuing in all areas -- the range is 
extensive," said Robert Hall, editor of Jane's Intelligence 
Review. 
  The Russians have a unique approach to many scientific 
problems because of the restrictions they faced during the Cold 
War. Lack of access to the West's computer revolution left them 
reliant on such areas as theoretical mathematics. And they 
became great innovative "lateral thinkers" to overcome some of 
the scientific hurdles they faced. Consequently their expertise 
in areas such as electromagnetic power, aerodynamics, underwater 
propulsion, and laser, microwave and other "beam" technology 
often rivals that of the West and sometimes exceeds it. 
  The Russians have already demonstrated they can generate 10 
times the electromagnetic energy the United States has achieved 
and with much smaller equipment. This could be used in a 
variety of weapons, such as tank guns and an air "bomb" that 
could disable all electronics over a wide area. 
  There is also speculation that the Russians have developed 
an 
ultra-quiet submarine propulsion system that uses 
electromagnetic forces to draw in water through a duct and 
squirt it out the stern. 
  Some of their electronic systems have confused Western 
experts, including the Zaslon radar fitted to MiG-31 aircraft. 
Leading electronics expert Mike Witt said: "This system puzzled 
Western experts when it was unveiled in 1991 because it appeared 
to be able to see backwards." 
  Russian scientists are also working on a system known as 
Infra- Red Search and Track that detects aircraft by their heat 
and, therefore, overcomes so-called "Stealth" technology. 
  Britain is developing a similar system for the four-nation 
Eurofighter project and scientists would be very keen to 
establish how the Russian system works. 
  Russia is making significant progress in missile technology 
and last year unveiled its equivalent of the US Patriot 
anti-missile system known as the S300V. During a demonstration 
at Abu Dhabi four missiles were fired and successfully destroyed 
targets in the air almost 20 miles away. It is said to be able 
to track 24 targets simultaneously and then prioritise the 
targets before firing four missiles from two launchers. 
  Advanced work is being carried out to develop affordable 
anti- aircraft missiles such as the new shoulder-launched Igla 
which should bring in desperately needed hard currency from 
sales abroad.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Polutov] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok, 10 Mar -- TOKYO SHIMBUN is the first 
foreign news organization to be allowed to report on a 
dismantling plant for nuclear-powered submarines in the Russian 
Far East. This plant is known to be the source of radioactive 
waste dumped into the Japan Sea last October, and we were 
allowed to take photos of submarines being dismantled. The 
plant was filled with about 300 containers of solid nuclear 
waste, and it was obvious the plant's storage capacity was 
reaching its limits. 
  Last month, Russia refused to accept the new London 
Convention, which prohibits the dumping of any radioactive waste 
into the sea. The submarine dismantling plant is facing 
difficulties in continuing its operations due to a surplus of 
radioactive waste. Therefore, the plant is calling for the 
resumption of dumping of radioactive waste. 
  "Zvezda (Star)" plant is located in Borshoy-Kamen Bay, 120 
kilometers east of Vladivostok. The plant was founded in 1954 
as a dock for warships and submarines, but is currently 
dismantling superannuated nuclear-powered submarines which were 
scrapped one after another during the past several years. 
  Unauthorized entry to the plant is strictly forbidden, and 
the gate is guarded by security authorities. The plant is 
divided into A and B zones, and when this correspondent visited 
the facility, a "Delta-1" class (displacement: 9,000 tons) was 
being disassembled in A zone. Both the bow and the stern of the 
Delta-1 were sliced off, and the body was placed in a dock as if 
it were a huge sausage. Its missile launcher used to be a great 
threat to the Western nations, but it has now been reduced to a 
pile of scrap iron. Compared to the beautifully streamlined 
shapes of Russian submarines, of which this correspondent is 
familiar, the heap of scrap iron looked miserable. 
  Director Maslakov said that the Zvezda plant had already 
dismantled five nuclear submarines. He added that the plant 
currently has four submarines to dismantle, but two of them are 
still untouched. 
  Since the Russian Pacific Fleet has discontinued its dumping 
of solid nuclear waste from 1990, about 300 containers (with a 
capacity of 1.5 cubic meters each) of solid nuclear waste have 
been stored in the plant. The dumping of liquid nuclear waste 
was also suspended last fall due to criticism from the 
international community. The liquid waste tankers "TNT-5" and 
"TNT-27" were moored at a pier near the plant, but they were 
said to be full of liquid waste. 
  Explaining the seriousness of the current situation, 
Director 
Maslakov stated: "This plant is just like a man without a 
kidney. The dismantling of nuclear submarines cannot continue 
without the disposal of nuclear waste. If the plant stops its 
operations, the Pacific Fleet would become unable to carry on 
its normal duties, which may cause social unrest." 
  To say nothing of the budget to build new disposal 
facilities, the plant cannot afford to pay wages to its 
employees. Director Maslakov said "the resumption of nuclear 
waste dumping is inevitable unless Japan and other Western 
nations offer funds for constructing (nuclear waste disposal 
facilities)."

  [Text] New York March 7 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
kravchuk said there is a direct connection between Ukraine's 
nuclear weapons and its economic status. 
  Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his 
visit to the United States in New york City on Monday, Kravchuk 
said that "when ukraine gets rid of the last nuclear missile, 
its economy will be freed from the heavy burden and the republic 
will be able to step up the process of reform." 
  "We realise that the West links nuclear weapons with 
assistance to reform programmes. But I would like to say that 
the process of freeing oneself from nuclear weapons is not 
directly connected with the process of reform. When discussing 
this question, we proceed from the possibility of providing us 
with security guarantees. If the economic situation continues 
to worsen, it will be harder for us to carry out the processes 
which we have pledged to carry out. This is true not only of 
nuclear weapons, but also of the country's debt," Kravchuk said. 
  "It should be understood that in conditions of economic 
chaos 
it is extremely hard to fulfil one's obligations. Ukraine is 
not trying to play a `nuclear card.' We are speaking about 
absolutely logical facts which should be taken into 
consideration. The first trainload of nuclear warheads has 
already arrived in Russia. Ukraine is adherent to the 
three-party accords signed in Moscow. But it must be helped in 
carrying out the process of nuclear disarmament, not hampered," 
the Ukrainian leader said.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk during </F>
question and answer session at news conference in Kiev -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] 
Japanese TV and Radio Corporation [word indistinct]. Could you 
tell us, Mr. President, whether Ukraine plans to dismantle all 
of its nuclear weapons, and what the prospects are for getting 
real security guarantees after their elimination. 
  Kravchuk: According to the trilateral agreement, 
Ukraine will dismantle all its nuclear arms. Incidentally, 
START I, which the Supreme Council has ratified, and Paragraph 5 
of the Lisbon Protocol, reservations on which have been lifted, 
imply precisely that -- the elimination of all nuclear arms. 
According to the bilateral agreements, in particular those with 
Russia, Ukraine will abide by its commitments provided other 
states do the same and abide by their commitments, without 
creating complications during the period of eliminating nuclear 
arms. We must find ways to solve the most complex issues 
without putting the brakes on this extremely important process 
for the entire world and all its people. 
  As for security guarantees, the United States, Russia, and 
other states, have given their consent for such guarantees, and 
this is no longer a problem. Our ministry [not further 
specified] is currently working on a relevant mechanism to 
determine whether it will be a statement or an agreement, who 
will sign it, and what its content will be. But we also realize 
that both Russia and the United States tie the provision of 
security guarantees in a documented form with the ratification 
of the Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT], although by lifting the 
reservations with regard to the Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine has 
committed itself to joining the NPT as a non-nuclear state. It 
is a commitment and not mere words, but the NPT has to be 
ratified. Relevant documents have been submitted to the Supreme 
Council, and we will work persistently together with the 
ministry and the Cabinet of Ministers in order to gradually push 
it through and work this problem out. 
  I am convinced that Ukraine will, in accordance with its 
obligations and the conceptual principles it has declared, act 
consistently in this sensitive global area. This is a long-term 
and fundamental policy for our state. [Passage omitted] 
  Correspondent Makarychenko: Leonid Makarychenko, 
Intelnews agency. Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I would still 
like to get a more precise reply to the question of whether the 
movement of fuel for Ukraine's nuclear power stations in the 
reverse direction -- from Russia -- has begun. Second, will 
your accord with Russia and the United States, your dialogue, 
allow a market to open to Ukrainian enterprises for conventional 
armaments? And third, Ukraine's space program. The carriers 
which launch space ships can easily launch other loads, too. 
Will these limitations not concern space programs? 
  Kravchuk: Well, we have just taken out 60 
warheads. So this is not yet such a, say, large amount that one 
can talk about a reverse movement. We are to take out 200 
warheads by the end of May. An appropriate scheme is being 
elaborated. I stress that the agreement, which has been 
concluded and initialled by Ukraine and Russia, envisages this; 
that is, whenever this may be, for example, in one week or in 
two, but it is envisaged. This does not mean that containers 
with nuclear warheads meet, greet each other, and go their 
separate ways. There should be a certain timeframe. But this 
is envisaged in the agreement. That is, this is envisaged both 
in (?the) trilateral statement and in the documents affixed to 
it. And no one, neither Russia nor Ukraine, have refused. That 
is, this will be carried out. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- A framework 
agreement between the Governments of Ukraine and Japan "On 
cooperation in eliminating nuclear weapons in Ukraine and 
setting up a cooperation committee" was signed at Ukraine's 
Foreign Affairs Ministry on 2 March. On behalf of the Ukrainian 
side the agreement was signed by Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko and on behalf of the Japanese side by Japan's 
ambassador to Ukraine Shoji Suezawa. "This is the first 
agreement between Japan and the independent Ukraine since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between our two states in 
1992. Japan hopes Ukraine will confidently travel the road of 
rejecting nuclear weapons and will accede to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty as a non nuclear state," Suedzawa 
stated. Zlenko pointed out that Japan was one of the first 
countries to have signed such an agreement. In his view, "this 
document will promote stronger cooperation between our 
countries. The signing of this agreement is a certain 
contribution to implementing the trilateral statement by the 
Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian presidents, signed on 14 January." 
  A UNIAN correspondent has been informed by the Japanese 
Embassy in Ukraine that the final sum of Japanese aid to 
eliminate nuclear weapons in Ukraine has not been determined yet.

sciences: "Ukraine's Nuclear `Cheapness'"] 
  [Text] Here is information that was broadcast on 16 
January on the "Ostankino" TV channel: "Ukraine will not 
receive any other compensations except for reciprocal fuel 
elements for atomic electric power plants." Proceeding from 
this concise thesis, what advantages for Ukraine can one speak 
about in general? 
  First, Ukraine will only receive $300 million out of the 
$800 
million allocated by the United States for the nuclear 
disarmament of the CIS countries. This sum [$300 million] is 
allocated for dismantling the world's third most powerful 
nuclear arsenal that is much larger than those of, for example, 
Belarus and Kazakhstan taken together. 
  Second, Ukraine will have to allocate several times that sum 
from its own resources for the destruction of the missiles 
themselves, their fuel filling, and especially launch silos. In 
accordance with previous estimates, this will amount to at least 
$3.2 billion. However, who will cover the resulting deficit of 
about $3 billion for the service being rendered by Ukraine in 
order to reinforce the national security of the United States 
and Russia, something, which the leaders of those countries do 
not deny. What about the advertised free market principles, 
based upon a balance of demand and supply? 
  Third, if something really needs to be compensated for in 
full, it is Ukraine's growing strategic vulnerability. In 
accordance with the information issued by high-ranking 
representatives of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense that was 
broadcast on Ukrainian TV Channel One on 17 January, it may be 
necessary to proceed to modern types of nonnuclear weapons, 
something about which the Ukrainian president cautioned earlier. 
This means that it will be necessary to take additional 
enormous sums from the budget. However, due to the absence of 
any prospects of resolving this problem without assistance from 
the Russian military industrial complex, more specifically, by 
crediting its functioning, this may only be done by lowering the 
standard of living of the Ukrainian population. 
  Fourth, such crediting will, in fact, be done for Russia's 
atomic industry. Russia has the possibility of selling the 
Ukrainian part of uranium for hard currency and at world prices 
and, at the same time, setting exclusive prices for those fuel 
elements that will be supplied to Ukraine. Belarus has already 
expressed its disagreement with Russia's thesis that the "lion's 
share" of profits from the sales of uranium will go toward 
covering the expenditure for destroying the missiles (IZVESTIYA, 
19 January 1994). 
  Moreover, at the news conference held by Colonel General Ye. 
Maslin, main expert of Russia's Ministry of Defense, that was 
broadcast by "Ostankino" on 18 January, a categorical demand was 
made that all nuclear missile warheads be immediately 
transferred to Russia as only then would reciprocal supplies of 
fuel elements be made. As they say, the more you have, the more 
you want. 
  On the whole, even from the point of view of the degree of 
reliability of the highly advertised economic advantages that 
Ukraine may get, all of this does not look as radiant and nice 
as the numerous "advertisers" are trying to prove. At the same 
time, the "Ostankino" TV channel asserts with confidence and 
optimism that here, too, "Russia will in no way sacrifice its 
own national interests." Can anyone say the same thing about 
Ukraine? 
  This particularly applies to the problem of guaranteeing 
Ukraine's national security, especially against the background 
of the recent "optimistically probabilistic" statement by the 
U.S. president who said there were "very good chances that 
Russia will not become an expansionist state again and will not 
threaten its neighbors." In simpler terms, this statement means 
that the United States will certainly never get involved in 
warfare with nuclear Russia, even if the latter does resume its 
"old" practices. 
  What real guarantees for Ukraine can one talk about in 
general, if the two formal presidential guarantees in respect of 
the 14 January 1994 agreement will expire in three years time? 
  Regarding declarations about the beginning of a new 
nonnuclear era, India has already dropped its "nuclear fly" into 
the nonnuclear "ointment" of the American and Russian promises, 
having declared that it was not going to proceed in the 
"Ukrainian direction," also in view of all its accompanying 
motivations. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that Ukraine will 
remain the only standard-bearer of the movement toward a radiant 
"nonnuclear" future. It is true, however, that we are used to 
moving in "radiant" directions. In recent decades, we have done 
nothing but that.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Mykola Bilovil, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA </F>
military columnist: "We Will Never Give Away Our Lard or Our 
Missiles! Once Again About Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] Ever since the question of eliminating Ukrainian 
strategic weapons arose, a song that I heard sung on the beach 
by a little girl has been haunting me: "The old woman took care 
of her old man as long as he had lard [Ukrainian traditional 
staple food]." 
  Nuclear weapons constitute our lard. 
  These are 46 SS-24 launchers, 130 SS-19 units, and about 40 
heavy bombers TU-160 and TU-95 MS, for which 670 cruise missiles 
equipped with nuclear warheads are stored. 
  The availability of such quantities of powerful weapons has, 
in fact, placed Ukraine at the center of worldwide attention, to 
an extent that even the U.S. President overcame his reluctance 
and made a visit to Boryspil airport -- our capital's air gate 
-- to meet with President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  Some people triumphed on this occasion -- a victory of our 
diplomacy -- major foreign leaders are coming to us cap in hand. 
However, we should not be so naive! They will come to us and 
will try to please us as long as our "old man" president has 
that same "lard" that everybody wants. Since, as long as we 
have it, someone's [Russia's] hands are securely bound. 
  Isn't this clear? Who would care about us today and who 
would remember about us in this time of economic troubles, if, 
by virtue of fate, we had not become heirs to those same 
strategic forces, which, over the long years of the "Cold War," 
helped maintain peace and quiet? 
  It is of interest to recall the evolution in U.S.-Ukrainian 
relations from the very beginning of the process of nuclear 
missile disarmament. At first, the frenzied pressure upon us: 
Give away all of your missiles or things will be bad for you! 
We gave away tactical weapons.... The world silently accepted 
our gift to Russia, but for us this only meant losses. 
  The pressure built up. At long last, we came to our senses 
and put forward conditions: security guarantees, financial 
assistance, and compensations. At first, nobody would even 
listen to us. Just behold that enfeebled Ukraine putting 
forward conditions! Even the first U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine 
Roman Popadyuk started threatening us: You are inviting fire. 
  We were not scared. We had enough common sense to uphold our 
position. 
  This time, the Tripartite Statement was signed in Moscow. 
However, here, too, we only got great promises in words and 
nothing specific in practice. 
  UKRAYINSKA HAZETA has written about all of these sudden 
changes around our lard, which is presently referred to as 
"Ukrainian snickers," since its first issue. It also stated 
that nuclear weapons have too much influence upon the world 
climate and that it should not be treated too lightly. 
  Even though we had been led to that same borderline where, 
it 
might seem, one could already echo Hemingway's "Farewell to 
arms!" our parliament had enough brains not to make the last 
step leading to the abyss: The deputies voted against Ukraine's 
joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  Oh, how much excitement this caused in the Russian press, 
radio, and television! There was more mayhem about this in 
Russia than in the United States. 
  Why did Russia raise that outcry? Is it interested in our 
disarmament more than the United States is? 
  It appears so. How can it be otherwise? Belarus handed over 
its missiles and so did Kazakhstan. Stubborn Ukraine alone 
prevents Russia from becoming the only nuclear-missile queen on 
the territory of the former Warsaw Pact. There is enough in it 
to cause one to go out of his mind! 
  One important circumstance rendered the Russians 
particularly 
anxious: In 1995, the validity of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty expires. The future of this document will depend upon 
the decisions of an international conference. Unless Ukraine 
joins the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty now, this question may 
become irrelevant in its own right. 
  Russian papers write that, in such a case, the "domino 
theory" will work and quite a number of states will remain 
nuclear. 
  For my part, I want to ask: Why are you so concerned about 
the future? Don't you see that, today, Israel, China, and North 
Korea are becoming nuclear powers? Or let faraway countries arm 
themselves, while nearby Ukraine must give away its nuclear 
warheads? 
  Incidentally, a few words about the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. It was approved by the UN General Assembly in 1968. 
Today, 158 states are signatories. The main objective of the 
treaty is to restrict the proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
to ensure international control over the fulfillment by the 
states of their obligations. For those who are signatories to 
the treaty and have nuclear weapons, these obligations mean that 
nuclear weapons or nuclear detonators should not be passed on to 
any other country, and nonnuclear states should not be 
encouraged to acquire nuclear arsenals. Those, who do not have 
such weapons, undertake not to receive them from others and not 
to manufacture them at home. 
  As one can see, there is not a single word on the relations 
of nuclear states among themselves. It follows from this that 
they may pass these deadly weapons to one another. 
  However, there is not a single allusion at the situation, 
which has taken shape in our country after the disintegration of 
the USSR. Ukraine was not a nuclear state, and strategic forces 
of the Union were deployed on its territory. Ukraine never was 
a participant in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, because 
there was no need for it to be one. It appears that it made a 
bad error by signing the Lisbon Protocol, having thereby driven 
itself into a kind of trap. Had there been good will on the part 
of the world community, Ukraine's signature would have simply be 
canceled as legally invalid. 
  However, nobody cares now and everybody keeps demanding: 
Ukraine, get yourself into the noose that you have prepared for 
yourself. They are demanding, because they know that the 
unfortunate year 1995 will come, the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty will become ineffective, and Ukraine will have to declare 
itself a nuclear power and join the nuclear club. 
  It is true that our parliament ratified Article 5 of the 
Lisbon Protocol recommending Ukraine to join the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty as soon as possible. However, a 
question arises: On what terms? As a nuclear power or as a 
nonnuclear state? 
  Academician I. Yukhnovskyy stresses in UKRAYINSKA HAZETA 
that 
we are owners, but not masters of strategic complexes. This 
situation is also not provided for in the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. Why then should we join it and in what 
capacity? 
  In my opinion, we must state our position once and for all. 
Here, all international bodies should have helped us, if they 
had sincere and open intentions. We can see that all they do is 
making fabrications and trying hard to swindle us and bring us 
to our knees, so that they could then deal with a secondary and 
obedient state. What will then remain from our independence, 
which we have gained through such a painful process. Just 
recollections? 
  I do not believe that there is no way out from this 
extremely 
complicated situation, a way out that will be acceptable for 
everybody. 
  Is the Ukrainian state with such a great scientific and 
technological potential unable to deal with its own missiles? 
If there are too many of them, we must only leave the quantity 
we need and ensure their proper servicing, without aiming them 
at anyone. Let them remain on stand-by. The rest of the 
missiles must be dismantled, the fuel must be used for peaceful 
purposes, and the silos and frames of the launchers for economic 
needs. I fully agree with Ihor Rafayilovych [Yukhnovskyy]. 
  All of this must be done by our own efforts. We are capable 
of doing this. Our scientists have already found a way to 
neutralize the extremely harmful component of nuclear fuel -- 
heptyl. At the same time, Americans proposed their assistance 
in processing the highly enriched uranium into low-grade uranium. 
  What else do we need? Money, perhaps? Right, and let Bill 
Clinton fulfill his promises. 
  It is hard to understand why we remain poor when we have 
such 
wealth. Other states put in much effort to extract uranium, and 
they sell it. We have nuclear fuel as the stuffing of warheads. 
Is it really more difficult to extract it from there than from 
mines? 
  I also have a question for new U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine 
Mr. 
W. Miller. If his country is really capable of providing us 
with considerable monetary assistance (on credit, of course), 
why doesn't it do it now instead of simply declaring its 
intentions? 
  Give us the necessary capital and we, jointly with U.S. 
entrepreneurs, will very quickly organize the processing of 
highly enriched uranium into low-grade uranium, will repay you 
with it, will provide our atomic plants with fuel, and will also 
sell it to Russia or exchange it for something there. This is a 
perfectly realistic project from which everybody will benefit. 
However, no way, Washington does not accept such a variant. It 
only has one demand: Give away your missiles, Ukraine. Then we 
will wipe our feet on you. Isn't it so, Mr. Miller? Please 
explain this to our readers and to our people. Explain honestly 
and openly. 
  Nuclear fuel is now in very short supply. In Russia -- at 
the Smolensk, Leningrad, and Kursk atomic electric power plants 
[AES] -- fuel reserves are coming to an end. At the Chernobyl 
AES, one power unit has already been halted. An energy collapse 
has set in. Or, perhaps, we are being deliberately pushed into 
such a situation in order that we would later buy that same 
uranium, at any price, from the United States? 
  Answer this question, too, Mr. Miller. 
  Our president intends to ask between $600 million and $800 
million from the United States. This capital might help us 
emerge from the crisis. However, there is little hope that this 
money will be obtained. Who needs a strong and powerful Ukraine? 
  As for those missiles that still remain in their combat 
positions, they could serve as a counterbalance until Ukraine 
joins the nuclear club and becomes, on that basis, a participant 
in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Following that and 
together with all other nuclear powers Ukraine will start 
disarming. 
  Between 3 and 8 March, L.M. Kravchuk will meet with Bill 
Clinton in the United States. Bill Clinton's letter, announced 
by our president at the Supreme Council session, led our 
parliamentarians to vote for removing reservations from the 
Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol. In that letter, the U.S. 
President promised to double all types of assistance to us and 
even to take care of our missile officers. The latter is very 
important. Because, today, our commander of a rocket division 
gets 2.2 million coupons and a lieutenant in the Russian Army -- 
190,000 rubles [figures as published]. 
  However, will everything be the way we would like it to be? 
  Doubts, doubts.... That is why we would very much like our 
president to adopt the right line of conduct, so that all of us 
would not have to sing "the old woman took care of her old man 
as long as he had lard...."

  [Text] Ukraine's minister of defense Army General V. 
Radetskyy visited a garrison stationed in Vinnytsya Oblast. 
  During the meeting with officers and generals at the 
headquarters of Ukraine's Air Force, Vitaliy Radetskyy stressed 
that the merger of the Air Force and Air Defense had been 
suspended. It is necessary to work on this problem as a 
promising one. The defense minister presented the new Air Force 
commander -- Lieutenant General Volodymyr Antonets, appointed to 
the post by a Ukrainian presidential edict. 
  "We are military people and must fulfill our supreme 
commander's order," commented the minister upon the changes in 
the personnel. "Rally passions within troops are 
inadmissible...." 
  Radetskyy also met with officers of the command of the 43d 
Strategic Rocket Troops and stressed once again that Ukraine is 
a missile and space power and that even after the program for 
nuclear disarmament is completed, missile specialists will have 
to fulfill specific work for the defense of our country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mr. Leotard Criticizes Mr. </F>
Mitterrand's Suggestions on M-5 Nuclear Missile Programs"] 
  [Text] On Thursday, 3 March, Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard spoke before the National Assembly's Finance Committee 
in a public session. He stated that the wish to adapt the TN-75 
missile warhead (already in use on the current M-45 missile) to 
the future M-5 submarine missile and the wish to produce a 
land-based version, christened the S-5, for the Albion platform 
silos, would be decisions entailing "unreasonable costs." By 
saying this, Mr. Leotard indirectly criticized a wish expressed 
by the head of state in a recent interview with AFP and which he 
repeated, with a vigor that surprised his listeners, at the 
meeting of the Defense Council on 16 February. 
  Mr. Leotard stressed: "If we are to implement the M-5 
nuclear missile program, we need to carry out tests to develop 
the new TN- 100 warhead (which was originally intended for it)." 
Replying to former (Socialist) Defense Minister Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement, who asked him about the possibility of equipping 
the M-5 missile with the TN-75 nuclear warhead which currently 
arms the existing M-45 submarine missiles, Mr. Leotard said: 
"That would be unreasonably expensive." He continued: 
"Adapting the M-5 to the Albion platform in its land-based 
version named S-5 would also incur unreasonable costs." 
  Much heavier than the current S-3D missiles equipping the 
Albion platform, the M-5 missile and its land-based derivative, 
the S-5, would mean restructuring the underground silos. The 
TN-100 warhead has the dual advantage of being smaller and more 
"stealthy" than the TN-75. It is known that Rally for the 
Republic President Jacques Chirac is in favor of the M-5 program 
and of restarting tests to perfect the new nuclear warhead.

  Moreover, Mr. Leotard stated that the M-5 program was begun 
early, "in 1992 instead of in 1995" by former Defense Minister 
Pierre Joxe, and that "we must return to a more normal rate of 
progression for this program." He continued by saying that, as 
indicated in the White Paper for Defense, "nuclear modernization 
has been placed on temporary hold," but that an "unprecedented" 
budgetary effort is being made with a view to the development of 
nuclear test simulation technologies, with 1994 funding 
amounting to 280 million French francs [Fr]. Mr. Leotard 
stated: "This amount should double" in the 1995-2000 military 
programming law, enabling France to acquire the simulation 
capacities enjoyed by the Americans "in nine or 10 years' time." 
  The defense minister pointed out: "In no way is the existing 
French deterrent threatened by the moratorium imposed on nuclear 
tests," which remain necessary "to acquire this simulation 
capacity." He thus indicated that the future military 
programming law would take this fact into consideration. He 
also stated that the renewal of the nonproliferation treaty in 
1995 does not pose any particular problems for France, which 
will sign it. On the other hand, he reminded the committee that 
France would only approve the total test ban treaty, currently 
being negotiated in Geneva and which the Americans would like to 
see concluded in 1996, "if France masters the capacity for 
simulation." 
<H5>  Maintaining the Level of Equipment Credits </H5>
  In addition, the minister expressed his wish to see 
"equipment credits maintained or increased in constant franc 
terms" in the next five-year programming law. "The chosen base 
is Fr100.4 billion," i.e., an initial sum equal to equipment 
credits granted in 1994. 
  The budget for the military programming law is currently 
being studied by the government. It should have been submitted 
to the Defense Council on 16 February, but was not because the 
prime minister's final arbitration had not yet been received. 
Mr. Mitterrand is demanding that the final project be submitted 
by the end of March. Within the government, discussions have 
run into difficulties concerning the annual rate of increase of 
defense credits before inflation. 
  The defense minister envisages a rise of 2.5 to 3 percent, 
which would still mean sacrificing certain arms programs 
(reducing orders, spreading orders over time, or even radically 
abandoning whole projects). The budget minister, who must 
operate within the limits of the law controlling public 
expenditure passed by Parliament at the end of 1993, refused to 
depart from the rule whereby all state expenditure must be 
reduced by an average of 0.5 percent over the next few years. 
  Lastly, Mr. Leotard stated, for the first time, that the 
cost 
of each Rafale fighter aircraft would be Fr315 million 
unequipped and Fr588 million fully armed and with all spare 
parts and regular maintenance included.

"Britain and Russia Stand Down Their Missiles"] 
  [Text] Russia and Britain agreed yesterday to stop aiming 
strategic nuclear missiles at one another's territory in a move 
seen as vital to helping Boris Yeltsin's reform programme and 
undermining those calling for a return to Russian expansionism. 
  The agreement, intended to take effect from May, was sealed 
at talks in the Kremlin between Mr. Yeltsin, the Russian 
president, and John Major. 
  Mr. Major hailed the move as a "remarkable and courageous" 
step which would have been inconceivable a few years ago. 
  In immediate operational terms the declaration means little. 
But aside from its intended impact on Russian domestic opinion 
it is a powerful symbol of political change, marking the end of 
the nuclear confrontation that for the past 40 years has been 
used by successive British governments to justify spending 
billions of pounds on maintaining first V bombers, then 
submarines, on constant strategic alert. 
  The Russians signed a similar deal with the Americans after 
President Clinton's visit to Moscow in January. British 
officials said yesterday that the momentum provided by the 
Anglo-Russian deal could help to curb the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Britain and the former Red Army have also agreed, for the 
first time since the second world war, to hold joint military 
exercises in Russia and Britain next year. Whether they will 
include the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force has yet to be 
decided, but Mr. Major told Mr. Yeltsin that he would be happy 
to hold the first exercise, at battalion strength, in Britain. 
  "This degree of military co-operation at this particular 
level is unprecedented," Mr. Major said at a glittering signing 
ceremony in the Red Room at the Kremlin. 
  British Embassy officials said that the proposed 
de-targeting 
would cover both countries' entire stocks of strategic nuclear 
weapons. Long range ballistic missiles are aimed at programming 
their guidance computers with the geographical co-ordinates of 
the target, whether an enemy missile silo, a military command 
bunker or a city. However, the process probably takes only 
minutes -- perhaps seconds -- and it could be reversed in an 
equally short time. 
  Britain's present nuclear force -- soon to be replaced by 
Trident -- consists of four Polaris missile submarines, one of 
which is always on patrol in the Atlantic. Each submarine 
carries 16 ballistic missiles, each with a range of 2,900 miles 
and a multiple Chevaline warhead designed to penetrate the 
former Soviet missile defences. 
  Chevaline replaced a simpler warhead in the 1980's. Because 
the technical difficulties were underestimated, it cost far more 
than forecast. But it was pushed through because of a presumed 
need to meet the so-called "Moscow criterion" -- convincing the 
former Soviet leaders that if they attacked Britain they would 
not remain safe in their Moscow bunkers. A Polaris missile, with 
its new multiple warhead, including radar decoys, would always 
get through the anti-missile defences, however much they were 
improved. 
  For some time now, threatening Moscow has ceased to be the 
decisive criterion of Britain's strategic deterrent policy. The 
&pound;10 billion Trident submarine programme is being justified 
as 
insurance against deliberately unspecified threats, and perhaps 
even to deter Third World dictators who acquire nuclear weapons 
in the way that Saddam Hussein nearly did. 
  However, with Nato officials increasingly worried that 
Russia 
may yet revert to an imperialist stance against neighbouring 
countries, Britain hopes that the move on missiles will have 
some symbolic significance within Russia. 
  One British official said: "It sends a powerful signal that 
neither side considers the other adversaries." The British 
clearly hope that it will also help to undercut popular support 
for Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Liberal Democrat 
party, whose far-right expansionist doctrine has been based on 
the premise that the West is a sworn enemy of Russia. 
  In an attempt to head off his internal critics, Mr. Yeltsin 
yesterday praised the "dynamics" of his own visit to Britain 
last year and this week's return trip by Mr. Major. He said 
de-targeting had been seen as "a hypothetical question for 
generations, possibly even centuries ahead. But now it is 
reality." 
  He repeatedly assured Mr. Major in their talks that he was 
committed to moving ahead with the economic reform programme and 
he would not be put off by opposition from his parliament. 
  The de-targeting follows Nato's decision in January to back 
a 
"partnership for peace" agreement giving the new eastern 
European democracies associated Nato status. 
  Paradoxically, Moscow may never have been on the active 
target list, because although the Polaris force could in 
extremis be used independently by Britain, it has long been 
assigned to Nato. 
  Its targets were chosen in the context of Nato's Nuclear 
Operations Plan, prepared by the Supreme Allied Commander's 
staff at Mons, Belgium, and as an adjunct to the U.S. Single 
Integrated Operational Plan drawn up in Omaha, Nebraska. 
  Institutionally, removing Russia from the list does 
therefore 
make a considerable difference. The most fascinating question 
raised by yesterday's agreement is: what other targets, if any, 
will now be chosen as more appropriate? And will the computers' 
previous programmes be wiped out, or merely stored?

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Evans, defense correspondent: "Rifkind </F>
Tackles Missile Threat"] 
  [Text] Britain may need to buy a ballistic-missile defence 
system to counter an increasing threat from the proliferation of 
long-range weapons. Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence Secretary, said 
yesterday. He has ordered a two-year study into whether the 
spending of billions to protect this country and its servicemen 
abroad would be justified. 
  Mr. Rifkind added that a study was also under way to examine 
the possible purchase of stand-off cruise missiles, another 
expensive option. He emphasised that ballistic-missile 
technology was not confined just to those countries that Britain 
had "traditionally regarded as threatening us". 
  The need for a ballistic-missile defence system is based on 
the assumption that such countries as Libya or Iraq, within 
potential range of Britain, could pose a threat within ten years 
or so. More than 20 countries are known to be buying or 
developing ballistic-missile systems. 
  During the Cold War, Britain's strategy against a Soviet 
missile attack was based on deterrence. The possession of 
Polaris and its replacement Trident missile system was thought 
sufficient to deter the Soviet Union from launching a nuclear 
attack. 
  In the post-Cold War era, the threat could come from 
countries prepared to call Britain's bluff and launch an attack, 
gambling that the Government would not retaliate with a 
strategic Trident missile. Partly to meet this threat, the 
Ministry of Defence intends to convert some Trident missiles 
into sub-strategic, shorter-range systems. 
  The new study will examine which countries are likely to 
acquire effective missile systems, whether they pose a threat to 
Britain, what warheads they might have (nuclear, chemical, 
biological or conventional) and if a defensive system is 
affordable. Although there is no estimate, a national system 
could cost several billion pounds. 
  Addressing the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College, 
London, Mr. Rifkind said ballistic-missile defence had moved 
from the "Star Wars" projects of Cold War days to programmes 
with more limited scope.

  [Text] Tokyo March 7 TASS -- The first-ever seminar on 
control over arms trade has opened in Tokyo for new independent 
states, former republics of the Soviet Union. Only three of the 
ex-Soviet countries, the Baltic republics, are not attending. 
The other twelve countries sent twenty specialists on 
disarmament and customs officers to attend the seminar. 
  Japan's Foreign Ministry, the main organiser of the five-day 
seminar, told ITAR-TASS that earlier such contacts had been 
carried out only on bilateral level, including with Russia. 
  But as Tokyo grows ever more concerned over the growing 
scale 
of arms trading, including illegal, in Asia, Japan's Foreign 
Ministry and Ministry of Foreign Commerce and Industry have 
decided to considerably increase the range of participants in 
the seminar within the frame of the general technical assistance 
to new independent states. 
  The seminar's chief task is to demonstrate to ex-Soviet 
republics, in most of which the custom services are just gaining 
their footing, the latest achievements for use in combatting 
illegal trade operations and discuss measures undertaken by the 
Japanese government to supervise armaments, disarmament and the 
proliferation of weapons and their components.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Seismologists and 
diplomats from 23 countries met in Tokyo on Monday [14 March] to 
discuss problems involved in monitoring underground nuclear 
tests, a central theme of the Comprehensive Test Ban (CTB) 
treaty now under negotiation, Foreign Ministry officials said 
Monday. 
  Thirty-six seismologists and diplomats in charge of the CTB 
negotiations from such nations as Australia, China, France, 
India, Russia and the United States gathered for an unofficial 
meeting at the ministry, the officials said. 
  The participants mainly discussed seismological methods of 
detecting nuclear tests, including their effectiveness, cost and 
operation, they said. 
  Since it was the first time seismologists and CTB 
negotiators 
have held such a meeting, the two sides exchanged general views 
and did not attempt to reach a particular agreement, they said. 
  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the seismologists will visit the 
Meteorological Agency to study Japanese systems to monitor 
earthquakes, they said. 
  Nuclear tests have been conducted only underground since 
1984, based on the 1963 partial nuclear test ban treaty. 
  Artificial earthquakes caused by nuclear explosions are 
registered at seismological observatories in each country. 
  Scientific experts set up a group in 1976 to discuss ways to 
create a system to monitor nuclear tests using seismological 
methods.

<H5>  Iran </H5>
  Some 883 kilos of morphine have been seized from an 
international drug gang in the border village of Gonbad-Kahriz, 
according to the prosecutor of the provincial Islamic 
revolution's tribunal. He said four active members of the gang 
were also arrested during the operation. Provincial law 
enforcement forces have seized about 4.3 tons of morphine from 
17 international drug gangs and arrested 110 traffickers over 
the past 11 months. (Tehran IRNA in English 1903 GMT 23 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Italy </H5>
  Men from the Special Operations Section working with 
carabinieri from Massa Carrara, have seized nine sacks 
containing 450 kilos of pure cocaine hidden in a consignment of 
coffee. The sacks were found inside a container unloaded from a 
cargo ship called "Saint-Pierre," which was flying a Cypriot 
flag and which came from Colombia. The cocaine, which has a 
street value of 200 billion lire, was destined, according to the 
carabinieri, for a group of Sicilian mafia members active in 
northern Italy and came from the Medellin cartel. (Rome RAI 
Televideo Teletext in Italian 1402 GMT 23 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Spain </H5>
  The Malaga Civil Guard has intercepted a consignment of 2.5 
tons of hashish in an operation carried out in the last few 
days. The drugs seized would have been worth over 7.5 billion 
pesetas on the black market. The police have broken up the main 
network of drug traffickers operating in Cantabria, arresting 
its 13 members. Various amounts of heroin, cocaine, and hashish 
were seized, as well as money, firearms, cars, a boat, and 
numerous jewels. The alleged leader of the drug-trafficking 
network, Juan Marin Cardenas, was arrested and handed over to 
the judiciary three years ago, when 2 kilos of cocaine that had 
come from Galicia were found in his possession. (Madrid RNE-1 
Radio Network in Spanish 1900 GMT 19 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Turkey </H5>
  A British woman is in jail in Turkey, accused of trying to 
smuggle 60,000 English pounds worth of heroin out of Istanbul's 
Ataturk Airport. Angela Corkmaz, understood to be 36 and 
married to a Turk, is alleged to have been carrying a kilo of 
the drug as she tried to board a charter flight back to England.

  [Text] President Guillermo Endara of Panama and President 
Cesar Gaviria of Colombia have signed a joint declaration at the 
fourth meeting of the Colombian-Panamanian neighbors' 
commission. The two presidents signed the Transfer of Convicted 
Individuals Treaty, the Illegal Immigrants Agreement, and the 
Complementary Protocol on the Legal Assistant and Mutual 
Cooperation Agreement in Medellin. They also created the 
Permanent Commission for the Demarcation of the 
Colombian-Panamanian Border at the meeting. This commission will 
hold its first technical meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota on 17 and 
18 March. 
  In one of the paragraphs of the joint declaration, President 
Gaviria reiterated his satisfaction with Panama's efforts for 
the orderly transfer of the Panama Canal, which will occur on 31 
December 1999, and the canal's administration. According to a 
press note released by the Panamanian Presidency, the two 
presidents expressed their firm conviction that a full and 
participative democracy is the appropriate framework to meet the 
people's needs. They also agreed that social development 
programs strengthen democracy and that fighting poverty is a 
priority. 
  An ANSA dispatch, datelined Medellin, reports that yesterday 
Gaviria stressed the need for Colombia and Panama to consolidate 
their integration and cooperation to fight drug trafficking 
jointly. He maintained that "the big effort" the two countries 
are making to confront drug trafficking would be greatly 
rewarded "if we were able to strengthen coordination and 
cooperation between our nations' authorities on a permanent 
basis. Colombia and Panama have a great opportunity to fight 
this scourge; we can do more to make this threat disappear 
forever," Gaviria said at the opening of the fourth meeting of 
the Colombian-Panamanian neighbors' commission.

  [Text] The creation of an International Judicial Assistance 
Office, involving the United Nations and each country on the 
continent, to promote the exchange of information that may 
contribute to complete investigations into cases of drug 
trafficking, was approved during the recent South American 
Antidrug Convention. This was an initiative of the Peruvian 
delegation. 
  Information on this important agreement was disclosed by 
Ernesto Vera Tudela, member of the 11th Lima Criminal Superior 
Court, who represented Peru together with Victor Prado, Judge 
Irma Simeon, and prosecutor Loayza y Sanchez of the Attorney 
General's Office. 
  The convention was held in Bogota, Colombia, and had the 
merit, thanks to Peru, of implementing an agreement that was 
signed but never enacted in 1988, when the first proposal to 
create a Judicial Assistance Office of these characteristics was 
made. 
  Vera Tudela said that the Peruvian proposal was approved and 
received the congratulations of the Colombian Justice Minister 
himself, in view of the fact that offices of this nature, at a 
continental level, are currently necessary to provide 
information requested by any Judicial Branch of the area in 
order to be able to complete an investigation. 
  Vera Tudela commented: "Police investigations were only 
coordinated through Interpol, but we lack a coordination between 
Judicial Branches in order to be able to complete investigations 
which many times reach a stalemate because the necessary 
evidence or information is retained in another country." 
  He added that the purpose is to create this office at a 
Judicial Branch level so that it can encourage the signing of 
conventions and agreements of public need, to allow the 
clarification not only of drug trafficking crimes but also 
crimes against the state, trafficking in minors, etc.

  [Text] Although the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left] is not being investigated by the Controlled Substances 
Court, it is the main defendant in the Chavarria case. 
  The trial against Isaac Chavarria, accused of drug 
trafficking as a result of testimony by drug trafficker Meco 
Dominguez, is turning into a process against the MIR. The 
Dominguez file is a bomb that is beginning to take effect. 
  According to Meco Dominguez' testimony, Isaac Chavarria was 
a 
powerful drug trafficker protected by the MIR. The drugs and 
documents found at Chavarria's house and farms, as well as the 
testimony of half a dozen arrested drug traffickers are 
confirming the charges made by Dominguez. 
  Chavarria was an official MIR member. He obtained a MIR 
membership card in 1992 signed by Santa Cruz Prefect Rolando 
Arostegui and the MIR chief of Santa Cruz Department. 
  A Chavarria employee who is now under arrest, (Wilbert Cox 
Molina), described how Chavarria purchased and sold drugs. 
(Wilbert) states: "I also want to mention here that while my 
employer, Isaac Chavarria, whom I guarded, was hospitalized in 
the Calacoto Clinic in La Paz, he was visited on several 
occasions by Colonel Jorge Velazquez, chief of the Government 
House aides de camp; Mrs. Edith Paz Zamora; and Rosario Paz 
Zamora, who took him flowers; as well as by [MIR president] 
Oscar Eid Franco, who paid the hospital bill. He gave Edgar 
Fernandez [another Chavarria employee] about $25,000 to pay the 
hospital expenses." Oscar Eid Franco has confirmed that he paid 
the bill. 
  In this file we also find the answers to several questions. 
Meco Dominguez was arrested and taken to court when he broke his 
partnership with Chavarria and therefore with the MIR. Dominguez 
operated in the Regine discotheque, which has been closed by 
police investigations. Discotheque owner Juan Carlos Peredo Paz 
was arrested recently. Peredo Paz is a MIR member and a former 
official from the Agricultural Bank and the National Bank 
Superintendency. He has been a middleman in operations to 
launder dollars from drug trafficking activities. Peredo Paz has 
acknowledged that twice he received checks from Meco Dominguez 
for a total of $1.3 million. 
  In the third section of Meco Dominguez' case file we find a 
letter found by the Special Anti-Narcotics Force [FELCN] in 
Chavarria's house. It is signed by Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, who 
is currently at large. In this letter, Edgar Fernandez tells 
Chavarria, for whom he worked, that in November 1990 he was 
arrested by the FELCN in La Paz but was soon released from 
prison thanks to a telephone call that he, Edgar Fernandez, 
thinks was made by Susana Seleme [not further identified] from 
Government House. 
  Two pieces of evidence that unfortunately involve former 
President Jaime Paz Zamora are missing from this file. One of 
them is a video found in the house of Chavarria that FELCN did 
not want to show to either the public or the court. The FELCN 
also did not send to court the conflicting testimony between 
Meco Dominguez and Chavarria. In the testimony, Dominguez said 
in front of Chavarria that when Jaime Paz Zamora was president 
of the Republic he had lunch with Chavarria in a Santa Cruz 
restaurant. Meco Dominguez was present at the lunch but he says 
he did not hear the conversation between the two. 
  Two photographs, which already have been published in the 
newspapers, are also missing from the file. The first one, which 
was first published four years ago, shows Jaime Paz Zamora and 
Chavarria together. The second picture was published on 20 
February by EL DIARIO and shows Paz Zamora, Meco Dominguez, and 
top MIR leaders together. 
  The only explanation the MIR has given to the public so far 
is that, in effect, there was a friendship between Paz Zamora 
and Chavarria. The charges made by Meco Dominguez now must be 
proven or rejected in court. Has this friendship led Paz Zamora 
to cover up the illegal activities of Isaac Chavarria?

  [Text] The following is a JATA report on the connections 
between the MIR [Movement of Revolutionary Left] leadership and 
Bolivian drug kingpins: 
  The MIR leadership held meetings with Carmelo Meco Domingez, 
Isaac Chavarria Diaz de Medina, and Jorge Roca Suarez, aka Techo 
de Paja. This is what sentenced drug trafficker Meco Dominguez 
testified before Brazilian officials on 10 November 1993. At 
the time, Meco Dominguez was being sought by the Bolivian 
courts. According to the report, Meco Dominguez voluntarily 
presented himself before Brazilian police in Mato Grosso do Sul 
to provide information on his illegal activities in Bolivia. 
  Carmelo Meco Dominguez told the Brazilians that he, and his 
partner Chavarria, held at least 10 meetings with the MIR 
leadership to discuss issues pertaining to the financing of the 
1987 municipal elections and the 1989 general elections. 
  Dominguez told Brazilian antinarcotics police that these 
meetings were attended by the following MIR leaders: Jaime Paz 
Zamora; Oscar Eid Franco; Gaspar Encina; Rosario Paz Zamora; 
(Susana Seleme); [name indistinct] Arostegui; Jorge Mendez; 
Isaac Chavarria; Jorge Roca Suarez, aka Techo de Paja; and 
(Sando Kasp Saucedo), aka Checo. 
  Carmelo Meco Dominguez told Brazilian authorities that the 
meeting's objective was to discuss the financing of the 
elections and that he accepted this proposal in good faith 
because it was going to be good for the country. 
  Dominguez added that Paz Zamora and the aforementioned 
persons attended several meetings at Isaac Chavarria's house. 
He said: I want to note that we held about 10 meetings before 
the elections. We also held a very special meeting on 15 April 
1987 at Orlando Vaca Diez's house on Sucre Street in Santa Cruz 
to celebrate Jaime Paz Zamora's birthday. 
  This contradicts what [MIR President] Oscar Eid said on 21 
February on this program. Eid Franco said Carmelo Meco 
Dominguez was an uninvited guest, but on 10 November 1993 
Dominguez told Mato Grosso do Sul antinarcotics agents that he 
had been one of the organizers of the birthday party. Dominguez 
also said he had hired a Mexican folk band. How can anyone 
allege that Carmelo Dominguez was an uninvited guest. (He 
appears in one of the pictures taken at the time). He had 
organized the party and hired the Jalisco Mexican band in Santa 
Cruz. This party was publicized the next day in Santa Cruz 
newspapers. 
  Dominguez added that in July 1987, Paz Zamora arrived in 
Santa Cruz to hold another special meeting and that he 
personally went to Viru-Viru airport in his blue Toyota station 
wagon to drive the MIR leader to Isaac Chavarria's house, where 
they met Jorge Roca Suarez, aka Techo de Paja.

  [Text] La Paz, 24 Feb (EFE) -- The Bolivian Armed Forces 
today asked for clarification about alleged relations between 
traffickers and outstanding Bolivian politicians. They affirmed 
that the democratic system is guaranteed by the military 
institutions. 
  General Fernando Sanjinez, the Armed Forces commander in 
chief, today pointed out the need for a detailed investigation 
to see if trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez's charges are true. 
  The arrested trafficker leveled charges during his 
declaration to Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) and a La Paz 
judge. "Meco" Dominguez, who has Chagas disease, could not 
finish his declaration in view of his poor health condition. 
  He linked former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora and the 
leadership of his party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left 
(MIR), to the top Bolivian drug traffickers who allegedly 
provided financial support and transportation during their 
electoral campaigns. 
  Amid ever increasing dissatisfaction of their fellow party 
members, the MIR leaders today resumed a confidential meeting to 
analyze the charges of their alleged links with drug trafficking. 
  Acting MIR President Oscar Eid was challenged by some 
factions which plan to "save the party," while other factions 
urged Paz Zamora to break his silence and isolation, "guide the 
party," and "face the situation" now that his leadership is 
under discussion. 
  Meanwhile, newspapers published new photographs of Paz 
Zamora 
and Isaac "Oso" Chavarria--who was arrested by the FELCN in 
January during one of the largest antinarcotics operations--as 
well as a copy of one Guillermo Capobianco's handwritten letters 
dated 13 July 1987. 
  In the letter he congratulates Chavarria on his birthday. It 
begins: "Dear Oso: I will not be able to accompany Jaime and 
Oscar at the big celebration." The letter is signed by 
Capobianco, who was then an important MIR leader in Santa Cruz. 
  Other MIR leaders said that in 1987 "no one knew Mr. 
Chavarria was linked to drug trafficking."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Drug Trafficking Problem: Unfavorable Winds </F>
Blow From Washington"] 
  [Text] The U.S. anti-drug policy seems to have taken an 
unexpected and dramatic turn. First President Clinton himself, 
and later on the main U.S. Government authorities responsible 
for this area, announced to the world that the new 
administration had decided to lay emphasis on the prevention of 
drug consumption, and reduce repression activities. 
  This announcement made sense taking into account the 
lamentable and universal failure of the repression activities 
carried out by the Army and police of that superpower, as well 
as of those carried out by the cocaine producing countries. The 
millions invested during the last years of the U.S. Republican 
administration were wasted, because repression by itself only 
pushes drug prices up, and this in turn gives the drug 
traffickers more power, thus generating more production and 
involving new people in this illegal trade. Another irrefutable 
argument was that U.S. taxpayers were sick of seeing their money 
ill spent on repression actions within their country and abroad, 
instead of being used for more profitable purposes. 
  Bolivia received this news with a sense of relief and hope. 
The escalation in repression activities was not solving the 
problem at all; on the contrary it was creating the appropriate 
conditions for a fearful and dangerous wave of violence 
which--like what is happening in Colombia--could lead to 
bloodshed in the country, cause victims having nothing to do 
with drug trafficking, place the democratic process at stake, 
increase political and personal rivalries, and bring more hunger 
and unemployment to the conflictive rural areas engaged in 
producing coca leaves. 
  Recent reports from Washington point in a different 
direction, however, and one not so encouraging for Bolivia, as 
the plan to emphasize prevention rather than repression only 
applies to the United States, as the armed struggle against drug 
trafficking in Bolivia will be even greater. As a correspondent 
of the international media pointed out when the announcement was 
made on 9 February, the change furnished by Clinton's plan 
forecasts days of peace for the United States but of war for 
Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Mexico. 
  One could say that the increasing militarization of the 
struggle against drug trafficking is a positive fact, because it 
is a chance for the Armed Forces and police to receive more 
funds, thus relieving the National Treasury. This, however, is 
a cynical and highly dangerous conclusion for the country, which 
has nevertheless been handling this area in a very unscrupulous 
manner, through successive administrations. It is quite obvious 
that between intensifying a stupid war in the country, and 
having a poor Army and police, the latter is the much better 
choice. 
  If the government does not reject this alarming prospect, 
one 
could believe that this new policy is not only welcomed in 
Bolivia, but also that it was promoted by our government. One 
must not forget that behind this policy in the United States 
there are people of great influence in the State Department who 
support its implementation. 
  The official U.S. announcement states that $13 billion will 
be earmarked for the treatment and prevention of drug abuse in 
the United States, while $427 million will be invested to 
"eradicate" cocaine and heroin, the latter in the "golden 
triangle" formed by Laos, Burma, and Thailand. 
  It should also be recalled that these definitions of policy 
are part of a much broader concept which the Clinton 
administration calls "global affairs," [preceding two words in 
English] that is, a strategic concept focused on the U.S. 
national interests in its new role--which is now generally 
acknowledged--as international policeman. 
  Thus, the so-called struggle against drug trafficking is 
also 
designed to maintain satellite armies and their own forces 
trained in combat on foreign terrain. This was the cause of the 
recent and bitter controversy in Colombia, generated by the 
small and highly specialized units of the U.S. Army which enter 
into whatever country in the capacity of "engineers" or 
"physicians" engaged in civilian projects. The truth is--and 
this is quite obvious--that they carry out maneuvers using the 
"rapid deployment tactics" with which we became familiar two 
years ago. 
  Bolivians have the duty to be on the alert, and support our 
government if it dares to raise before international 
organizations the expediency of depenalizing drug production and 
consumption that are at this point banned. A sound argument 
would be that if we continue on this same path, Bolivia will be 
threatened by instability and violence, which is in no way 
suitable for South America's international system. People would 
listen to us if we had the courage to make the proposal. But in 
order to be able to do so we need to give up the comfortable 
situation of our Armed Forces living on the repression of drug 
trafficking.

  [Text] Minister of Government German Quiroga expressed his 
doubts about depositions made by two notorious drug traffickers 
involving former Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora in alleged 
meetings with "Thatched Roof" [drug lord Jorge Roca Suarez]. 
Quiroga said: "These depositions have been made by convicts 
linked to drug trafficking." 
  Quiroga said: "It is important not to hurt the dignity of 
citizens, especially those citizens who have occupied our 
nation's highest posts." He noted: "We must not forget the 
status of the people who made these depositions." 
  Quiroga recalled that the depositions were made by criminals 
who had been convicted by the courts of justice for being linked 
to drug trafficking rings. 
  Quiroga nevertheless reported that the depositions, videos, 
and photographs linked to drug trafficking crimes are part of 
the case portfolio sent to the courts of justice yesterday. 
  Minister Quiroga described the evidence as open to the 
public. He said: "It is therefore open to review by national 
public opinion." 
  Quiroga noted: "It is not fair to comment on issues that may 
have been brought up without carrying out an assessment, a 
review, and a complete investigation into these depositions." 
  In response to questions posed by journalists accredited to 
Government Palace, Quiroga pointed out: "There are serious 
contradictions between the depositions of the two drug 
traffickers." He noted: "The courts will make the actual 
assessment and conduct the appropriate investigations."

  [Text] La Paz, 25 Feb (EFE) -- The leaders of the Movement 
of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), former Bolivian President Jaime 
Paz Zamora's party, after two days of meetings behind closed 
doors asked Congress to investigate its possible link with drug 
trafficking. 
  Confessed drug trafficker Carmelo Dominguez, aka ``Meco,'' 
in 
a statement to authorities of the Special Antinarcotics Force 
(FELCN), linked Paz Zamora and his closest aids with the most 
important Bolivian drug traffickers. 
  Acting MIR leader Oscar Eid said that a congressional 
commission will determine whether or not the party as an 
institution was linked to drug trafficking, and added that if 
there is evidence involving one or another of the leaders, "we 
will promote the appropriate legal proceedings." 
  Eid also asserted that "there is no reason for the former 
chief of state (Paz Zamora) to be subject to any investigation." 
  So far the Bolivian media have published about half a dozen 
photographs of Paz Zamora accompanied by former Army Captain 
Isaac Chavarria, aka Oso, who is regarded by the FELCN as one of 
the greatest alleged drug traffickers. 
  Dominguez asserted that Paz Zamora personally "closed a 
deal" 
during a meeting in 1987 with Chavarria and Jorge Roca Suarez, 
aka "Techo de Paja [Thatched Roof]"--currently in prison in 
California, the United States, charged with drug 
trafficking--for $500,000 in financial aid for the MIR's 
electoral campaign.

  [Text] During its plenary session yesterday, the Chamber of 
Deputies accepted the Movement of the Revolutionary Left's [MIR] 
request that the lower house's Constitution Commission 
investigate this party. 
  I have said, quote, investigate this party, unquote, 
intentionally because MIR Deputy Mario Rueda Pena will now 
explain to us that the MIR is by no means, nor is it even 
suspected of being, involved with drug trafficking, but rather 
some of its leaders. 
  [Begin Rueda recording] It is not the MIR, my party--and 
this 
must be made quite clear--but some MIR leaders and militants, 
who have been mentioned by two outstanding Bolivian drug 
traffickers such as Meco Dominguez and Chavarria, to the judges 
in charge of hearing drug cases. I think Meco Dominguez rather 
than Chavarria made the charges. Therefore, let us not mistake 
the trees for the forest. The trees are those mentioned, and 
the forest is the institution, the party. It is not a matter of 
saying that the MIR is being investigated; I belong to the MIR, 
and nobody can say I am involved with drug trafficking, that I 
am linked to drug trafficking, or can you accuse me of that? 
Not me. Anyway, the Chamber of Deputies Constitutional 
Commission will determine who is involved. Well, they already 
have the names, the names have already been made public, and 
among them more or less 300 to 500 outstanding MIR leaders are 
not mentioned, nor are the thousands and thousands of militants 
the MIR has in its capacity as an institution. [end recording] 
  Mario Ruedas is right. But the MIR leaders themselves are to 
blame for the confusion. The MIR leaders yesterday held a news 
conference during which they said that the MIR rejects, the MIR 
is submitting itself, the MIR--several things in its capacity as 
an institution, as a political party--but they did not bother to 
identify those involved in this affair with Meco Dominguez and 
Oso Chavarria. We are referring to an institution with more 
than 20 years of impeccable reputation.

  [Text] MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] leader 
Fernando Cajias has said that his party should give an 
explanation not only to Congress, but also to the public. 
  The first problem was that of corruption. Now 
"narcopolitics" [narcopolitica] is casting doubts over the New 
Majority faction of the MIR. 
  Party leader Fernando Cajias has said that the important 
thing in this democratic war is to defend and preserve the 
project that the party has historically endorsed. 
  [Begin Cajias recording] To this end it is essential to 
introduce changes, because we believe that [passage indistinct]. 
[end recording] 
  The new MIR proposal is that in addition to giving an 
explanation to the public, the party has to reorganize itself. 
[recorded passage indistinct] 
  Jaime Paz is reportedly untouchable. Is that true? We asked 
Cajias about it. 
  [Begin Cajias recording] I believe that, undoubtedly, as he 
is--in metaphorical language--the marshal of the forces, he has 
to be spared for the big battles that still lie ahead. Yet this 
does not prevent him from the obligation to give orientation and 
guidance. 
  (I made) a proposal, but I did not say that he has to give 
an 
overly encompassing explanation of some problems, but he does 
have to break his silence, particularly at an internal party 
level, in order to guide party members. [end recording] 
  Cajias finally emphasized that the MIR should give an 
explanation to the country.

  [Text] Former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco said 
Isaac Chavarria evidently financed the Revolutionary Left 
Movement's, MIR's, political campaign. He explained that a MIR 
committee was then in charge of collecting those funds. 
  Capobianco added, however, that he did not know about 
Chavarria's illegal activities and Chavarria had introduced 
himself as a prosperous businessman. 
  Capobianco requested that Gonzalo Torrico explain whether he 
knew about Chavarria's illegal activities. The former minister 
said Chavarria contributed money to the MIR New Majority 
political campaign, but he does not know exactly when the 
contribution was made. He added that Chavarria lent his planes 
to former President Jaime Paz Zamora's campaign, during which 
the photographs that have been creating commotion were taken. 
  Capobianco explained that he does not know how much 
Chavarria 
gave the campaign. He denied, however, receiving these funds 
because they were handed to a committee of MIR members in charge 
of receiving this sort of campaign contribution. 
  Capobianco pointed out that at the time, the MIR was fully 
implementing the New Majority political program, but did not 
count on the financial help of prosperous businessmen as 
interested as we were, he said, in financially supporting them. 
He added that at that time, Chavarria introduced himself as a 
prosperous businessman dedicated to agricultural activities in 
the Chiquitana region and offered to help in the implementation 
work [words indistinct]. From then on, he said, facts are known 
to a [word indistinct] committee and that he has nothing to do 
with them.

  [Text] Cochabamba, 16 Feb (EL MUNDO) -- President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada said: "We disagree with the reduction of U.S. 
economic aid for interdiction and against drug trafficking. We 
believe we should have serious and permanent U.S. economic aid 
without disregarding national sovereignty. We should not be left 
alone with this problem. The United States now wants to 
concentrate more on the struggle against drug trafficking within 
its borders." 
  Sanchez de Lozada held a very confidential meeting in 
Cochabamba's El Carmen Hotel with a U.S. senator [Robert Graham] 
from Florida who is a member of a committee on appropriations 
and intelligence and with the U.S. ambassador. Sanchez said: 
"The meeting was very important to let them know we believe it 
is just and necessary to have the continuation of aid but 
without violating national sovereignty. The struggle against 
drug trafficking is a Bolivian priority; it is not imposed but 
we need support for its success." 
  Sanchez emphasized: The policy and appropriation of funds to 
fight drug trafficking depend a great deal on the U.S. 
committee. For Bolivia this is very important; there is a trend 
to cut resources for the developing countries. The U.S. 
Government also has problems with the budget deficit. 
  Sanchez, who denied reports that the U.S. officials gave 
some 
kind of ultimatum for the total eradication of coca within the 
framework of the "Zero Option" project, said this issue was not 
discussed. 
  Sanchez added: "There is nothing concrete on the `Zero 
Option' project. What we are after is a new project that would 
not leave us with the traditional mechanism of repression, 
eradication, and substitution. The `Zero Option' is still 
unknown. We are seeking a final solution, not a traumatic 
solution, to get out of this situation because that would not be 
good for anyone, for either the country, the peasants, or the 
world." 
  Sanchez also said he conveyed to the U.S. ambassador and the 
senator the firm Bolivian commitment, as a country and a 
society, to struggle against drug trafficking, and "to try to 
get out of the drug business" that is destroying youths and 
becoming very dangerous because when it is combined with armed 
groups or cartels it will create violence. 
  Sanchez indicated that this is an economic and social 
problem; it is not only a problem of repression because jobs 
also should be offered to the coca growers--"this is why we are 
trying to carry out projects such as the Capitalization and 
Popular Participation projects. Jobs must be created in the 
coca areas and the entire country to prevent coca growing from 
being a good business because the price of coca varies according 
to the level of repression." 
  Regarding the charges made by coca growers that members of 
Direco [Coca Reduction Directorate] and Dinaco [National Coca 
Control Directorate] were eradicating coca by force on 14 
February, President Sanchez said there is no forced coca 
eradication in the country. "It is not included in the 
legislation and, according to Law No. 1008 of Coca and 
Controlled Substances, only after payments are made is it 
mandatory to eradicate the coca plantations; all the other 
eradications are still voluntary." 
  Meanwhile, coca growers have declared themselves in a state 
of emergency, suspended coca substitution, and announced a large 
meeting for today in Villa Tunari to protest the lack of 
government answers to their demands for alternative development 
and the depenalization of coca, and for the defense of coca, 
which they are sure will be eradicated by force to fulfill the 
eradication quota of 6,500 hectares by 31 March because not even 
50 percent of that quota has been fulfilled. 
  President Sanchez said: "The eradication is voluntary in 
Bolivia. The coca growers are like COB [Bolivian Labor 
Federation] members; they talk without knowing or give 
information for their benefit or distort it. But I am not 
offended; it is part of democracy."

<F P=106> [Interview with Daniel Sanchez Chavez, director of the </F>
National Directorate for Agricultural Reconversion; place and 
date not given; first paragraph is LOS TIEMPOS editorial 
introduction] 
  [Text] The cultivation of coca leaves has cultural value in 
the countries of the Andes Mountains and is the source of 
livelihood for thousands of Bolivian families. This crop now 
faces eradication of its surplus production. However, the budget 
for eradication has been cut, and new forms of activity have 
been adopted to achieve technical viability and provide 
favorable economic prospects, thereby creating a natural way of 
changing economic life. FACETAS spoke with Dr. Daniel Sanchez 
Chavez, director of the National Directorate of Agricultural 
Reconversion (DIRECO), who has been the director of this 
organization since April 1992. A specialist in this subject who 
has done post-graduate work in Japan, San Jose, Costa Rica, and 
Brazil, Daniel Sanchez analyzes and considers the process of 
agricultural reconversion in this interview. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] Is DIRECO a repressive agency or a technical 
organization? 
  [Sanchez] The National Directorate of Agricultural 
Reconversion, or DIRECO, is an institution which has, among 
other purposes, the objective of planning, executing, and 
supervising plans for reducing the cultivation of coca leaves in 
the illegal and surplus transitional production areas, as 
provided for by law. All of this is done within the framework of 
voluntary cooperation with the farmers producing coca leaves. 
Therefore, it can be seen that our work is clearly technical in 
character and distinct from any kind of repressive activity. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] In view of the changes in DIRECO what kind of 
work does it perform? 
  [Sanchez] In the work program of the National Directorate of 
Agricultural Reconversion (DIRECO) the efforts of its officials 
to develop goals and objectives are of primary importance. 
Consequently, some of their efforts have been devoted to 
improving working conditions by providing our employees with 
annual vacations; arranging for their reassignment to other 
duties, which means higher salaries for better trained and more 
efficient, professional workers; and making the 200 employees of 
DIRECO eligible for the benefits of social security. 
Furthermore, we have restructured the agency to make it function 
more efficiently and to integrate the operational, technical 
support, and administrative areas. We know that this effort has 
still not gone far enough, and some unsatisfied expectations 
remain. 
  In the operational area, beginning in 1992, DIRECO undertook 
a new type of activity called "Reduction Programs," which 
consist of carrying out public works of a social type, in 
exchange for the farmers' reducing a certain number of hectares 
of coca leaf cultivation, in a framework of negotiation and 
cooperation with the communities benefiting from such work. In 
this way, during the 1992 operational year, 17 public works of 
different types were undertaken in several communities, at an 
overall cost of 224,225 bolivianos. During the 1993 operational 
year, 32 public works costing 317,071 bolivianos were completed. 
As a result, DIRECO has been turned into an agent of change 
which makes it possible for it to achieve credibility and 
develop a technical and nonrepressive identity. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] What is the framework under which DIRECO 
carries on its activities, under the existing, bilateral 
agreements? 
  [Sanchez] The Bilateral Agreement contains an understanding 
between the American and Bolivian Governments. In it the 
government of the United States of North America commits itself 
to provide aid to the Bolivian economic recovery program, and 
the Bolivian Government commits itself to implement the Law on 
the Production of Coca Leaves and Controlled Substances. This 
law provides for crop reduction, substitution, and development, 
through the application of an integrated development and 
substitution program involving 5,000 to 8,000 hectares planted 
to coca each year. 
  In the framework of this basic document DIRECO must prepare 
and execute an Operational Plan aimed at satisfying the 
objectives contained in the policy approved by the Bolivian 
Government. This policy provides for the cooperation and 
voluntary participation of coca leaf producers in the illicit 
and surplus coca leaf producing areas of Bolivia. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] "Reduction, Substitution, and Development"--is 
this the trilogy of alternative development in which DIRECO is 
participating? 
  [Sanchez] I believe that, given the complexity of this 
process, it is difficult to identify the actions and 
responsibility of each of the organizations implementing this 
program. However, the concept and techniques involved in this 
activity must be understood, together with the disinterested 
contribution of each of these organizations and based on their 
full cooperation and understanding. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] It was stated in a local publication that 
plans 
for the eradication of coca fields are far from complete. It has 
even been insinuated that there has been a kind of political 
boycott of the process. How much of this is true? 
  [Sanchez] The newspaper OPINION published an article 
indicating that plans for the eradication of coca fields are far 
from complete, within the approved time framework. It even 
insinuated that we are in the midst of a kind of political party 
boycott. As of 31 December 1993 DIRECO had completed about 60 
percent of its operational plan. During the next three months of 
the initial, planning period, the remaining 40 percent of the 
preparations can be completed, in accordance with existing 
plans, to carry out "Reduction Programs" in several communities. 
  Although this prospect is not particularly encouraging, we 
believe that, thanks to the efforts made by the personnel 
involved, we have succeeded in completing the second section of 
our plan. This was accomplished despite the serious limitations 
which we faced in 1993, such as a sustained and steadily rising 
increase in the price of coca leaves, the temporary suspension 
of funds earmarked for compensation and agricultural grants, and 
the unyielding opposition of the leadership of trade unions and 
elite groups in Bolivia which are opposed to the plans for a 
reduction in the planting of coca leaves. We believe that, 
thanks to the efforts made by our personnel, we have 
successfully completed the second segment of our plan. 
  Regarding the publication to which we referred, I must 
assume 
that the author of that article is completely ignorant about our 
policies and plans for a reduction in coca planting and the 
context in which this is taking place. The article in question 
gives the impression that we have hidden objectives. This does 
not reflect the ethical and moral behavior of a serious and 
responsible reporter. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] "Reduction Works"--is this a new plan for the 
eradication of coca plantings? 
  [Sanchez] I would say that it is a new way of doing things 
which made it possible for us to meet the urgent needs of the 
communities involved and to satisfy them to the extent that our 
budget allows us and given the predisposition of all members of 
the communes concerned to carry on a plan of concerted and 
negotiated reduction. In that way we can contribute to change 
and to the social and economic development of the region. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] Will the limitations be dealt with in the 
context of the program of agricultural reconversion? 
  [Sanchez] Agricultural reconversion is a long-term program 
and is a function of the emphasis on agriculture in the 
subtropical area of Cochabamba. It should be said that, on the 
basis of agricultural and ecological conditions in the region, 
the change in the patterns of production is based on permanent 
or perennial species of plants which begin to provide their 
"harvest" over the medium term. Consequently, this is a slow 
process, on the one hand. On the other hand, to be most 
effective, it requires very close coordination with all agencies 
involved in the agrarian sector. 
  So far, significant progress has been made in all of the 
programs undertaken by the IBTA/Chapare Project [Bolivian 
Institute of Agricultural and Livestock Technology at the 
Chapare]. A transfer of technology has taken place, involving 
systems of production which aim at accomplishing that mission. 
We think that what has been done so far is not enough, and there 
is a long way to go. We hope to do this in a coordinated and 
jointly agreed way, so that we will be able to get the best 
results. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] How would you summarize the social and 
economic 
background of coca leaf plantations? The peasant producers have 
accepted this program. Has there been any follow up? 
  [Sanchez] Although coca leaf growing has a cultural value in 
the Andean countries and is the means of support for many 
families in the subtropical areas of these countries, it is also 
used for illicit purposes which attack the morals and proper 
behavior of the people living in the countries which produce 
coca leaves. Consequently, plans for the reduction of coca 
planting have the objective of eradicating surplus production, 
while respecting the production of acceptable amounts intended 
for traditional, medicinal, and legal usage, related to our 
culture. 
  The farmers who voluntarily accept the plans for a reduction 
in the size of their fields planted to coca receive $2,000 in 
compensation, through the Agricultural Donation Fund. We believe 
that if the money from this fund is reinvested in planting a new 
area with a crop having technical viability and good marketing 
prospects, a change in the economy will come naturally. DIRECO 
does not follow up on changes made by those who own this 
agricultural land because there are other institutions working 
in this area. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] A reduction in North American aid has been 
reported. What is the truth about this? 
  [Sanchez] Any agreement is based on the implementation of 
its 
various parts, and any digression from this standard may involve 
a failure to comply with the goals that have been set. From that 
point of view it is necessary for all of the sectors involved in 
this problem to sit down to discuss and present our best 
considered points of view, while we remain fundamentally 
concerned about the best interests of our country and society. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] Following the layoff of employees at your 
directorate, there has been some discussion that DIRECO will 
soon be abolished. What are the facts about this? 
  [Sanchez] The personnel reduction at DIRECO is the result of 
financial problems and in no way was caused by false arguments 
which have been spread in the course of discussion of the 
problem. 
  It is a good thing to emphasize that the budgetary reduction 
which DIRECO has suffered has confronted us with the painful 
need to do without the services of some very capable people. The 
instinct of self-preservation demands that we face up to the 
lack of understanding and the critical remarks made by the 
people concerned.

  [Text]MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] Deputy 
Sergio Medinacelli, CONDEPA [Conscience of the Fatherland] 
Deputy Eduardo Paz, and ADN [Nationalist Democratic Action] 
Senator Jorge Landivar believe the new U.S. antidrug strategy, 
escalating the drug enforcement in the producing countries, will 
entail social problems. Therefore, their initial reaction was to 
reject transferring the "dirty war" to Bolivia. 
  In this regard, the three opposition congressmen lashed out 
at the fact that Bill Clinton's administration has decided to 
give more attention to its "domestic policy," leaving the 
producing countries at the mercy of clashes between drug 
traffickers and antidrug forces that, more often than not, kill 
peasants and not the criminals deeply involved in drug 
trafficking activities. 
  Landivar exclaimed: "We will not allow our country to become 
another Colombia." Paz pointed out: "An innocent people's 
bloodbath will be the result of an antidrug war." Medinacelli 
stressed: "We cannot pay for Clinton's pragmatism." 
<H5>  Like in the Industrial Field </H5>
  Medinacelli compared the U.S. decision with a situation that 
arose a few years ago in the industrial field when the United 
States purchased mineral complexes from Bolivia and paid for tin 
alone. Nevertheless, when the United States realized that 
refining tin damaged the U.S. environment, it preferred the 
refining to be carried out in our country. 
  The MIR congressman added: "The same happens with drug 
trafficking. First, the United States waged a cruel war against 
drug trafficking in which even politicians were involved, and 
now it wants this dirty war to be waged outside U.S. territory." 
<H5>  The Armed Forces Will Not Join the War </H5>
  After pointing out that the U.S. contribution always 
involved 
interdiction, with its consequences of violence and death, Paz 
ruled out the possibility that the Armed Forces might join the 
struggle against drug trafficking because in the past few years 
the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) has managed to 
accumulate more "firepower" than the Bolivian Army. 
  The CONDEPA deputy noted: "The U.S. decision will promote an 
antinational discussion on the viability of alternative 
development in our country." 
<H5>  He Is Not Acquainted With Latin America </H5>
  For his part, Landivar said Clinton's decision seems to be a 
result of his unawareness of the positive results yielded by 
alternative development in the Latin American countries. 
  In Bolivia, Landivar said, the Repentance Decree was the 
outcome of the social isolation to which the drug traffickers 
have been exposed through well-developed consciousness-raising 
campaigns.

  [Excerpt] Drug Prevention and Social Rehabilitation Under 
Secretary Jose Luis Harb yesterday disclosed that the Bolivian 
and Chilean Governments have agreed to unify their policies to 
prevent drug consumption in the high risk regions in both 
countries. 
  The plan is to establish control, education, and health 
promotion policies, as well as to work on drug prevention 
programs and the struggle against drug trafficking, as part of a 
plan to change the antinarcotics strategy. 
  In Jose Luis Harb's opinion, the most important achievements 
in international negotiations were those reached with the 
Chilean Government. 
  He asserted: "Important agreements have been reached for the 
establishment of common and reciprocal actions in the 
interdiction field, and for the exchange of information on the 
border control and particularly on illegal precursors smuggled 
into the country." 
  The "narco-influence" ["narco-influencia"] phenomenon, which 
the government has identified as the "number one" threat to 
youths in Bolivian territory, has increased the level of drug 
consumption in the country to 2 percent of the Bolivian 
population. 
  According to a study conducted by the Drug Prevention and 
Social Rehabilitation Undersecretariat, "narco-influence" has 
become the main concern of the Government Ministry due to 
Bolivia's character as a drug producer and generator of cocaine 
trafficking to the rest of the world. 
  Jose Luis Harb commented: "Most youths start off by getting 
involved in drug production, then in drug trafficking, and they 
end up becoming highly addicted." 
  This is how the "narco-influence" phenomenon is generated in 
Bolivia, although he did not mention the true origin of "the 
youths' involvement in the underworld." [passage omitted]

  [Text] National Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz 
yesterday warned that the government of President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada has undertaken an all-out offensive against 
drug trafficking by increasing antidrug operations in Chapare, 
by seizing substances that are considered precursors, and by 
eliminating all excessive or "illegal" coca farms in that area. 
Soliz said: "We want to make it clear that we are not 
fomenting a clash with peasants, but we will not hesitate to 
enforce the law." 
  He said that under the terms of Law 1008, legal coca farms 
destined for traditional consumption can cover an area of only 
12,000 hectares in the Yungas of La Paz. He reiterated that 
35,200 hectares must be eliminated in the next few years, 
regardless of whether peasants agree or disagree with this. 
"Illegal coca plantations are concentrated in Chapare. There 
are people who went to that area for the sole purpose of growing 
illegal coca plantations and causing problems for the 
government. We have reports that those people cut down many 
trees to prevent the government from enforcing the law," Soliz 
said. 
<H5>  Pits and Coca </H5>
  He explained that recent antidrug operations in Chapare have 
disclosed that coca has been planted for the exclusive purpose 
of producing cocaine. Maceration pits, which are the first 
stage for preparation of the drug, were detected a few meters 
from the plantations. 
  After showing to reporters several pictures of presumably 
new 
plantations, Soliz said that this type of activity cannot and 
must not be tolerated, for the sake of the country's image and 
of the commitments that Bolivian authorities have assumed with 
foreign governments. 
  He reported that in this regard, his secretariat has ordered 
the immediate destruction of illegal farms, adding that--in his 
opinion--this position is endorsed by the peasants who want to 
engage in the alternative development programs and plans. 
  He said that under the terms of the law, almost seven 
hectares were eradicated in the past two days, and that this 
task will continue in the following days. 
<H5>  Eradication </H5>
  Asked about fulfillment of the target of eradicating 5,000 
hectares of coca farms, which has been agreed upon with the U.S. 
Government, Soliz admitted that this target will hardly be 
fulfilled. "We doubt that the total number of agreed upon 
hectares will be eradicated, but the government will make all 
efforts to comply with its international commitment beyond 31 
March, which was the previously established deadline," he said. 
  Bilateral agreements are annually signed with the U.S. 
Government. The Bolivian side has to eradicate a specific 
number of "illegal" hectares in return for U.S. Government 
promises to provide economic aid to Bolivia for its balance of 
payments. 
  During fiscal year 1994, which is about to end in the United 
States, an agreement was reached providing for the eradication 
of 5,000 hectares in return for $40 million. This target, 
however, will not be fulfilled. 
  Fewer than 3,000 hectares of illegal farms have so far been 
eradicated. Meanwhile, disbursement of a third $10 million 
installment remains uncertain. Asked about the subject, Soliz 
said that the fourth installment will not be received because of 
the nonfulfillment of the target. 
<H5>  Less Money, More Hectares </H5>
  According to the explanation given by Soliz, for the 1995 
U.S. fiscal year--which has just begun--Bolivia will have to 
promise to eradicate a larger area of illegal coca farms. "When 
the next agreement is signed, the idea is to eradicate the 
largest possible area of `illegal' farms which do no good to the 
country," Soliz said. 
  However, he declined to refer to an increase in U.S. 
economic aid, which for the past two years has dropped 
considerably from $66 million in fiscal year 1993 to almost $40 
million in fiscal year 1994. If this downward trend continues, 
Bolivian obligations will grow as U.S. aid drops, Chapare coca 
growers' leaders have said.

  [Text] "Faced with a governmental onslaught," the 
Federation of Tropical Carrasco Settlers [Federacion de 
Colonizadores de Carrasco Tropical] is reorganizing the coca 
defense committees and has proposed "Option One" ["Opcion 
Uno"]--the expulsion of the DEA--to counter the government's 
"Option Zero" ["Opcion Cero"] which involves a massive reduction 
of our country's coca crops. 
  The communique was released following the government's 
decision to forcefully reduce all coca crops in the Chapare 
region and to mobilize Coca Reduction Directorate (DIRECO) 
agents who "intimidate and threaten our rank-and-file comrades, 
forcing them to reduce their coca crops." 
  In response to the government's "Option Zero"--which 
involves 
the eradication of our coca crops as a way of drug 
enforcement--the Federation of Tropical Carrasco Settlers 
proposes "Option One"--the expulsion of DEA officials from our 
country--"to reassert our national sovereignty." 
  The eight-point communique released yesterday, after the 
government again suspended a meeting scheduled to discuss coca 
problems, instructs federation members to nationally and 
regionally reorganize coca defense committees, which comprise 
all existing institutions and organizations. 
  In a serious warning, which seems like an imposition, the 
federation members call on citizens' committees of the tropical 
region and mayors' offices to support the coca growers' struggle. 
  The communique notes: "If they refuse, the coca producers 
will intervene these institutions." 
  The coca growers communique states: "Reject any governmental 
attempt to carry out a forceful reduction of coca crops." The 
communique also declares "a state of emergency and constant 
mobilization of our federation's ranks, and a suspension of the 
voluntary reduction of our coca crops until the government 
implements development projects." 
  The coordinating committee of the five coca growers 
federations also proposes "calling a protest rally in the town 
of Ivirgarzama as soon as possible." 
  The communique concludes by stating: "Faced with the 
government's Option Zero--which involves the complete removal of 
coca in the tropical region--we propose Option One, involving 
the DEA's expulsion from our national territory."

  [Text] Cochabamba -- Some 50,000 coca growers affiliated to 
the five coca growers federations of this department have been 
told to fight the imminent compulsory coca eradication that has 
generated a strained atmosphere in this tropical zone. 
  According to information obtained, the government has 
instructed the National Coca Control Directorate (DINACO) and 
the Coca Eradication Directorate (DIRECO) to fulfill the plan to 
eradicate all surplus coca plantations by 31 March "with or 
without dialogue." 
  Jorge Martinez, coordinator of the five federations, voiced 
his "deep concern" over the fact that government authorities 
"have given this order but they do not want to dialogue because 
since January they have repeatedly suspended scheduled meetings. 
They promised an answer in writing but have failed to give it." 
  Martinez asserted: "We are certain that the government is 
seeking to justify the compulsory eradication of coca 
plantations." He said that in view of this, the latest 
emergency meeting held in Ivirgazama decided to declare coca 
growers in a state of alert and mobilization. 
  He added: "We are organized," adding that the committees for 
the defense of coca leaf production in labor organizations and 
unions "are already alert." He said they have decided to 
suspend the voluntary eradication "in response to the 
government's lack of interest." 
  The leader added that "although the government is making fun 
of us" they will wait until 16 February for the announced 
meeting to take place, even though DIRECO "constantly threatens 
and pressures us." 
  Martinez charges that members of the Victor Ustariz Regiment 
and of the Special Forces Training Center (CITE) will enter the 
tropical zone to carry out maneuvers, but they believe "it is 
part of the plan to use force to eradicate the coca plantations." 
  In the face of this, he warned that coca growers will begin 
a 
hunger strike because they do not have the means to face the 
military men. He added: "There is a very tense atmosphere, there 
is fear that clashes will take place. This is, seemingly, what 
the gringos want to justify the intervention." 
  Martinez recalled that coca growers proposed amending 
Supreme 
Decree No. 23668 which eliminated the participation of the 
peasants as established by Supreme Decree No. 22270. "Now the 
government ministry is in charge of promoting development in 
Chapare and this is not right. We have made concrete proposals 
but have not received any answer." 
  Martinez added that if the authorities in charge of handling 
coca producer affairs do not answer, they will request an 
audience with the president of the Republic to whom they will 
explain their problems "within the framework of the people's 
participation plan he always talks about."

  [Editorial Report] Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese on 20 February publishes on page A12 a 700-word 
article by Gabriel Nogueira entitled "Deputy Denounces Air Taxi 
Companies." 
  The author bases his article on a report by Deputy Jose 
Dirceu based on Congressional Investigating Committee, CPI, and 
Federal Police investigations of the Paulo Cesar, PC, Farias and 
budget corruption schemes. 
  The author says the creation of "air taxi companies has 
become one of the most lucrative ways to launder money earned 
irregularly. Most large construction companies involved in the 
PC and budget scandals have planes registered as air taxis, 
which are used by legislators and public company executives in 
exchange for favors and in order to evade taxes." 
  The author says most companies use the legal benefits of 
current legislation granting tax exemptions to air taxi 
companies and facilitating the remittal of dollars abroad 
through leasing operations. 
  The author says: "Dozens of people open ghost companies 
abroad in the name of figureheads to purchase planes in the 
international market. Jose Dirceu says that once this is done 
the local company makes a contract with `the foreign company' 
for a rental operation (leasing) and starts legally remitting 
large sums of money abroad." The author says an additional 
advantage is that the law allows companies to deduct the amount 
paid for renting the planes from their tax reports. 
  The author says: "Civil Aviation Department, DAC, rules that 
regulate the operation of these planes are not respected and 
transgressors go unpunished because of the lack of supervision. 
There is no control over the millions of dollars sent abroad 
through false plane leasing operations." 
  The author says that "besides the famous cases of Brasil Jet 
and Mundial Aerotaxi owned by Paulo Cesar Farias," Deputy Jose 
Dirceu mentions the Taming company owned by Mendes Junior 
Construction Company, Aerotaxi Pampulha owned by Andrade 
Gutierrez Construction Company, Wanair owned by Cowan Company, 
the plane fleet owned by Tratex Construction Company, Crasa Taxi 
owned by CR Almeida Company, Morro Vermello owned by Camargo 
Correa Construction Company, Embrataxi owned by former Minas 
Gerais Governor Newton Cardoso, and the Plata company owned by 
economist Jose Carlos Alves doe Santos.

  [Text] In view of the arrest or possible surrender of Cali 
Cartel members, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has 
insisted in his well-known policy of the carrot and the stick. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentifed reporter] Were you aware that 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Hector Fabio Urdinola would 
surrender first? 
  [De Greiff] Yes, these are the two people who have appointed 
lawyers with whom we are advancing the process. You can be sure 
that I am confident, and the lawyers have said as much, that the 
process will not be limited to these two people but involve many 
others who unfortunately have engaged in drug trafficking. 
  [Reporter] Will they be the first ones? 
  [De Greiff] That is correct. 
  [Second unidentified reporter] Are we going to be having 
announcements as happened in the past with Pablo Escobar? 
  [De Greiff] Pardon me? 
  [Second reporter] Will we be having announcements of 
surrenders, as happened with Pablo Escobar in the past? 
  [De Greiff] I hope not, because they know and must keep in 
mind that as long as they do not surrender, we are going to 
continue pursuing them. Ultimately, they will meet with either 
Escobar's fate or the fate of those who have surrendered to 
justice. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Sandra Vergara from the "National </F>
Newscast"--passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff came to cool 
tempers. He assured he committed no irregularities in terms of 
the procedures for having Cali Cartel members surrender to 
justice. He met with Attorney General Carlos Arrieta early this 
morning, and he will meet with President Cesar Gaviria later 
this afternoon. 
  The prosecutor general will meet with the president of the 
Republic in a few hours to explain his position and the 
procedures carried out so far by the Prosecutor General's Office 
regarding the policy governing the surrender of Cali Cartel 
members. 
  After meeting with the prosecutor general, the attorney 
general today admitted there had been a confrontation between 
the Prosecutor General's Office and the Attorney General's 
Office because of a lack of clarity when charges were issued 
against alleged Cali Cartel members Olmedo Ocampo, Juan Carlos 
Ramirez, and Elmer Herrera. 
  [Arrieta] "State institutions cannot quarrel among 
themselves. It does not make sense. That is what government 
officials are for; that is why we sit down and talk, and when we 
talk, we make things clear and comprehensible. This does not 
mean there are no differences. There may be differences on 
various occasions." 
  On the other hand, the prosecutor general said a preliminary 
investigation continues against the three to uncover any facts 
that may incriminate them. 
  [De Greiff] "A permit or license to act illegally cannot 
possibly be issued in Colombia. It would be monstrous if this 
were possible. You cannot arrest a person just because an 
official thinks he is a criminal, only if you have proof that 
the person is a criminal." 
  The attorney general and the prosecutor general do not rule 
out the possibility that the alleged Cali Cartel members who 
presented themselves at the Prosecutor General's Office could 
have been taking part in a scheme designed to provoke a 
confrontation between the two government institutions. 
  [Arrieta] ``We are not dealing with honest citizens or with 
common people. We are dealing with a drug cartel. When you 
negotiate with a cartel, you must start with the assumption that 
all sorts of things might happen. The state must develop the 
ability to understand, prepare itself, and avoid all of their 
tricks." 
  [De Greiff] "We are not going to let them drag us into their 
game. We are going to proceed with the law in our hands and 
with the formalities established by the law in our efforts to 
convict these people." 
  It was also stated that the process for the surrender of 
Cali 
Cartel members remains suspended. Another subject that has 
angered the prosecutor general is the rumors of an alleged 
mediation by the Prosecutor General's Office to put an end to 
the war between the Cali and Medellin Cartels. 
  [De Greiff] "Naturally, the Prosecutor General's Office 
cannot serve as mediator between criminal organizations to stop 
them from killing each other or to achieve peace between them. 
It would be atrocious if that were true. That is not the 
mission of the Prosecutor General's Office, nor would the 
Prosecutor General's Office accept such a mission."

<F P=106> [From "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Credible legal sources have told Emisoras Caracol 
that members of the so-called Cali Cartel will not surrender en 
masse because of penal code stipulations, more particularly 
because of the vagueness and ambiguity of Article 389-E, which 
lately has been the subject of a spirited controversy among the 
Prosecutor General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, and 
officials of the Justice Ministry. 
  This recent controversy has prompted lawyers of the drug 
traffickers, who are being accused by authorities, to revise 
their strategy. Therefore, one of the Ordinolas [as heard] and 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela might be surrendering soon. 
  The mass surrenders that were announced at the end of 1993, 
however, following Pablo Escobar's death, will not take place. 
This was fully confirmed to Emisoras Caracol. 
  In the meantime, "Caracol's 0600-0900" learned the United 
States is very concerned about the latest Cali Cartel 
developments, and it has virtually suspended all cooperation in 
delivering and providing proof for pending trials of Cali 
Cartel's leaders. 
  The refusal to deliver evidence is based on the fact that 
the 
U.S. Government and Justice Department are currently unclear 
about what path Colombian justice will take regarding the 
Cartel. If the evidence were to be submitted to the Colombian 
Government, then the opportunity to use it in pending U.S. 
trials of the so-called drug traffickers will be lost.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 19 Feb (AFP) -- The daily EL 
TIEMPO, published in Santa Fe de Bogota, reported today that the 
Cali and Medellin Cartels, Colombia's two largest cocaine 
trafficking organizations, are negotiating a peace agreement 
after seven years of bloody war. According to EL TIEMPO, 
negotiations began two months ago, just 15 days after an elite 
Army squad killed Medellin Cartel's top leader Pablo Escobar on 
2 December. 
  The majority of Escobar's most well-known and violent 
lieutenants are already in prison after voluntarily surrendering 
to justice to obtain the legal benefits granted by a special law 
offered by the government to drug traffickers who turn 
themselves in. Cali Cartel leaders, through their lawyers, have 
contacted Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff to coordinate 
their surrender to justice. 
  According to EL TIEMPO, representatives from the two 
criminal 
organizations met clandestinely on 11 February somewhere in 
southwestern Valle del Cauca Department, where the Cali Cartel 
is based, to negotiate a peace agreement. EL TIEMPO reported a 
pregnant woman was also present at the meeting, representing 
Escobar's widow. 
  After Escobar's death, his eldest son, Juan Pablo Escobar, 
issued a public call for peace to his father's enemies, asking 
them to put an end to the confrontation and offering to talk. EL 
TIEMPO says the Cali Cartel practically imposed its conditions 
on the Medellin Cartel to end the confrontation because, 
according to a source cited by the daily, "the winner imposes 
the conditions." 
  According to EL TIEMPO, Cali Cartel leaders demanded the 
withdrawal of charges against brothers Fidel and Carlos Castano, 
who were accused of perpetrating an attack on a commercial plane 
that exploded on the air with 111 persons on board in December 
1989, from Escobar's men. In their confessions to obtain a 
reduction of their sentences, Medellin Cartel leaders reportedly 
accused the Castano brothers, well-known paramilitary chiefs, of 
perpetrating the terrorist attack on the plane. 
  Cali Cartel members also demanded that their traditional 
enemies turn over to them a man identified as Julio Mamey, who 
is accused of murdering Antioquia Department Governor Antonio 
Roldan Betancur in July 1989 when a car bomb exploded as his car 
was passing by. Authorities blamed the Cali Cartel for Roldan 
Betancur's murder, therefore, the Cali Cartel wants Mamey to 
tell the Prosecutor General's office that he received the order 
to kill the governor directly from Pablo Escobar, the Medellin 
Cartel's slain chief. 
  The Cali Cartel drug traffickers also demanded that the rest 
of Pablo Escobar's men who are still at large surrender to 
justice and serve the sentences issued by the Prosecutor 
General's Office. In addition, they demanded that Escobar's 
fortune be used to help the victims of the terrorism he 
unleashed during the past few years in Colombia. 
  Finally, EL TIEMPO reported that four of Escobar's top men, 
who are currently in prison, have already signed the peace 
agreement.

  [Text] Cali Cartel men, who appeared at the Prosecutor 
General's Office, have an extensive criminal record. Even though 
the prosecutor general said they do not have any outstanding 
debts with the justice system, their criminal record is 
extensive. 
  This is Elmer Herrera Buitrago. [video shows still 
photograph of man] The DEA, in one of its reports, calls him the 
drug king. He has been arrested five times in the United States 
for the possession of cocaine, conspiracy to distribute drugs, 
and conspiracy to escape. He served one sentence at the Oxford 
penitentiary. The DEA considers him to be the other big Cali 
Cartel associate in charge of distributing drugs in New York and 
money laundering operations. When he appeared before the 
prosecutor general he said he was in fact captured, prosecuted, 
sentenced, and released for these crimes in the United States. 
  Jose Olmedo Campo Duque, another one of the three 
individuals 
who appeared before the prosecutor general's office, owns 
properties raided by authorities in several narcotics 
operations. His farm, called Miralindo, was raided during the 
Green Ice and Robledo III Operations. San Francisco de Portugal, 
another one of his properties, was also raided during the 
Robledo II and III operations following the assassination of 
Carlos Galan and the Green Ice Operation. This property is 
currently in the hands of the National Narcotics Council. The 
cars that were confiscated were turned over to the Civil 
Aeronautics authorities. At this same farm, authorities found 
Russian-made weapons, six passports with the same name, and 
savings accounts from banks in Panama, Guatemala, and Miami. He 
was investigated for the killing of an Administrative Department 
of Security agent in 1990 and is still under investigation for 
vehicle theft and robbery. 
  On 2 May 1992, authorities raided his apartment on the 12th 
floor of the (Marley) Building in Cartagena. There they found 
weapons, various caliber ammunition, jewels, and a safe-conduct 
pass for Beatriz Elena Cuervo Londono. This raid was part of 
file No. 95-13 of a Santa Fe de Bogota public court order. The 
strange thing is that this file is under the name of Ivan 
Urdinola Grajales. In the Prosecutor General's Office files, 
this raid appears under another number, 15-156, a file which is 
still in the preliminary stages and which no one is responsible 
for yet. NTC News was able to determine that Jose Olmedo Campo 
Duque is still living on the 12th floor of this building. 
  Today, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said he knows 
about the criminal records of the Cali Cartel men who went to 
his office, and he added that he does not believe the Cali 
Cartel men will surrender in the next few hours. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office confirmed it knows about the 
raids and arrests made abroad against Jose Olmedo Campo Duque 
and Elmer Herrera Buitrago, alleged Cali drug traffickers. For 
the Prosecutor General's Office, however, these actions do not 
constitute enough evidence to link them to criminal drug 
trafficking activities. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] Up until now we have not seen 
any 
evidence against him as a result of those raids. [end recording] 
  Herrera Buitrago said he testified before De Greiff that he 
had been in prison for drug trafficking in the United States. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] If he served a sentence in the 
past, then naturally it is in the past. [end recording] 
  Gustavo de Greiff said Cali Cartel drug traffickers will not 
surrender in the next few hours. 
  [Begin De Greiff recording] We cannot say it is something 
imminent. [end recording] 
  Gustavo de Greiff said he will meet with the lawyers of the 
Cali drug traffickers and government officials the first week of 
March.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de </F>
Greiff by Felix de Bedout on 26 February; place not given; from 
the "NTC News" newscast--live] 
  [Excerpt] [De Bedout] Prosecutor General, what progress was 
made toward the surrender of Cali Cartel members during the 
meeting held yesterday? 
  [De Greiff] We made significant progress in stipulating the 
guidelines for cooperation and settling the details regarding 
the prison where they will stay. 
  [De Bedout] Which prison will it be? 
  [De Greiff] I think it will be one of the two 
maximum-security prisons that already exist in Valle Department, 
such as Palmira and Cali. 
  [De Bedout] This surrender process has been very 
controversial. Has the Prosecutor General's Office gone out of 
its way to facilitate the conditions for Cali Cartel members to 
surrender? 
  [De Greiff] No, no. I believe that the criminals' surrender 
and incarceration will not only benefit the country, but we will 
also be making progress toward defeating drug trafficking. 
  In the United States--for reasons I do not understand very 
well--they believe the fight against drug trafficking is useless 
and that only drug traffickers should be targeted. They argue 
that ending drug trafficking is an impossible mission, so they 
say the best course is to fight drug traffickers and try to stop 
as many of them as possible. Thus their war against drug 
trafficking has not been very successful. 
  I believe that both objectives--that drug traffickers pay 
for 
their crimes against society and that efforts be made to end 
drug trafficking--should be tackled. In Colombia's current 
situation--and we are not being naive or too optimistic--we 
might be able to defeat drug trafficking, at least in some areas 
of the country. In addition, we might be able to reduce the 
territory of those drug traffickers who want to continue their 
criminal activities. Gradually we can continue fighting them 
and reducing their territory even further until eventually--God 
willing--we can defeat this scourge. 
  [De Bedout] But do you believe that legalization would 
constitute a definitive cure? 
  [De Greiff] This issue requires more time and more research 
by economists, sociologists, doctors, chemists. I have only 
said that legalization is a possibility that must be considered. 
We must destroy the profits made by drug traffickers so this 
crime becomes less tempting and is eventually stamped out. 
  I reiterate: Colombia cannot do this unilaterally; it must 
be a multilateral action. We must promote research regarding 
this possibility and in the meantime continue our relentless 
fight on both fronts: against drug traffickers and drug 
trafficking. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Carolina Sanchez; from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Talks with attorneys representing Cali cartel 
members resumed over the past few hours despite the obvious 
cooling between the government and the Prosecutor General's 
Office over the drug traffickers' surrender process. The last 
meeting included the justice minister and the prosecutor general. 
  [Begin recording] [Sanchez] Government officials, Prosecutor 
General de Greiff, and attorneys representing the drug 
traffickers in Valle Department met again on the evening of 25 
February. This time the meeting focused on two specific topics: 
prisons and cooperation that should be shown by those criminals 
who have expressed their willingness to surrender. 
  [Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez] First we discussed the 
need to have these drug traffickers imprisoned in maximum 
security prisons. Second, we said their cooperation with the 
justice system must be efficient as [word indistinct] the 
surrender policy. 
  [Sanchez] The various organizations that participated in the 
meeting--the Administrative Department of Security, the 
Prosecutor General's Office, and the Justice Ministry--will 
review the proposals presented by the drug traffickers' 
representative, and the parties will meet again in eight days. 
  The government expects those criminals who surrender to 
cooperate efficiently with the system; that is, to provide 
evidence that can be used to prosecute other criminals and to 
help dismantle laboratories and drug trafficking networks. [end

<F P=106> [From "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] An investigation by the Prosecutor General's Office 
has indicated that drug traffickers from northern Valle del 
Cauca Department planned to prevent the arrival of U.S. Marines 
and to halt the Colombian Navy's intelligence network on the 
Colombian Pacific coast. 
  According to the Prosecutor General's Office, the plan 
included the hiring of two noncommissioned officers to accuse 
Navy Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez and other officers of the murder 
of more than 100 leftist leaders and labor union leaders from 
the Barrancabermeja area. 
  The Colombian Navy's intelligence network was established in 
August 1991 to fight gunrunning and drug trafficking activities 
on the Colombian Pacific coast. Drug traffickers later 
determined that Captain Juan Carlos Alvarez was responsible for 
establishing the network. Alvarez was then transferred to 
Barrancabermeja, where he organized the Navy's intelligence 
network along the Magdalena River. His mission was to uncover 
possible guerrilla attack plans. 
  In January 1993 Capt. Alvarez was transferred to Cartagena, 
where he was murdered on 6 August of that same year. According 
to the Prosecutor General's Office investigation, the captain 
was murdered by drug traffickers from Valle del Cauca. Jorge 
Hernan Gil has been identified as one of the hired assassins who 
murdered Alvarez. The Prosecutor General's Office also 
determined that a great deal of information had reached the drug 
traffickers in Valle del Cauca Department by way of Saulo 
Segura, an NCO who had worked on the Pacific network and who, 
along with Juan Carlos Lopez Maquilon, accused Col. Rodrigo 
Quinonez and other Navy officers of murdering more than 100 
leftist leaders and labor union leaders in Barrancabermeja. 
  The connection of both NCO's with the Cali Cartel is 
mentioned in statements made by several witnesses to the 
Prosecutor General's Office. Once the officers' connections 
were discovered, the drug traffickers hired four lawyers and 
sent the two NCO's to testify against the Navy intelligence 
chief and against several Pacific network officers. According 
to documents in the hands of the Prosecutor General's Office, 
the cartel intended to undermine the work done by the Navy 
intelligence network and prevent the arrival of the gringos in 
Juanchaco. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office uncovered this plan after 
three months of investigation, but the Cali Cartel was able to 
achieve one of its objective: to dismantle the Navy's 
intelligence network on the Pacific coast. 
  This week the Prosecutor General's Office issued arrest 
warrants against the two NCO's, but they have disappeared. One 
of them was taken out of the country.

  [Text] Alleged Valle Department drug trafficker Jaime 
Orejuela will not be released as was thought. The Cali regional 
prosecutor's office has issued a warrant for his arrest. 
  "National Newscast" established, through high-level sources 
within the Dijin [Judicial Police and Investigations 
Directorate], that an arrest warrant was issued yesterday by the 
Cali regional prosecutor's office against Jaime Orejuela 
Caballero for the illegal possession of weapons. Also, the 
Bogota regional prosecutor's office has another preliminary 
investigation under way for illegal profiteering. 
  With the Cali arrest warrant, Orejuela Caballero will be 
unable to gain his freedom or be extradited to the United States 
where he is sought for his role in cocaine production, 
possession, and distribution. In addition, the Colombian 
Constitution forbids the extradition of native-born Colombian 
citizens. 
  The DEA has also reported that Orejuela Caballero was 
involved in the murder of his former wife, and he is under 
investigation for his role in counterfeiting and arms 
trafficking to Colombia.

  [Text] Bogota, 23 Feb (EFE) -- Authorities have reported 
that Jaime Orejuela Caballero, one of the most important bosses 
of the drug-trafficking Cali Cartel, a man wanted by the United 
States, was arrested Tuesday by the Colombian police in a Cali 
neighborhood. According to Cali Police Chief General Jose 
Eustasio Reyes, his men captured 50-year-old Orejuela Caballero 
while he was driving his automobile in a Cali suburb. 
  Orejuela, who was transferred by plane to Bogota, is wanted 
by Interpol and could be transferred to the United States 
although no official announcement has been made about 
extradition plans. Gen. Reyes reported that a New York City 
court has filed an arrest warrant for the Colombian mafia boss, 
who is accused of possessing, producing, and distributing 
cocaine in NYC. He faces other charges also. 
  A few hours before the arrest, Colombia's Prosecutor General 
Gustavo De Greiff said in the city of Medellin, which is the 
headquarters of another notorious drug-traffic cartel, 
negotiations for the surrender of Cali Cartel chiefs are under 
way. The prosecutor general said the possible surrender of 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales, 
two alleged bosses of the Cali Cartel, is being negotiated. 
  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez told De Greiff in a letter 
that he is afraid there could be "legal maneuvers" behind the 
efforts of the drug-traffickers' attorneys, which are geared 
toward allowing the authorities to investigate the accused, then 
finding them not guilty due to a lack of evidence in Colombia. 
  According to the U.S. DEA, the Cali Cartel is Colombia's 
most 
important mafia group, more important than the almost dismantled 
Medellin Cartel, which controls 80 percent of the cocaine 
shipments to the United States.

<F P=106> [Article by Julian Rios Rojas: "Second Round Against </F>
Cartels"] 
  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota--The death of the drug trafficker 
Pablo Escobar Gaviria marked the beginning of a new battle in 
Colombia: putting an end to the Cali Cartel. 
  According to the international police forces, the proof that 
the organization started coming under attack this year is shown 
in the results of recent operations that have made it possible 
to seize abroad gigantic cocaine shipments originating with the 
Cali Cartel. 
  In Colombia, the Counternarcotics Police and the state's 
intelligence and security agencies also have set out to battle 
that group head-on, because, according to a high-ranking 
official of the institution, "Now, there will be more time to 
fight it." 
  The authorities prepared a study on the organization's 
modus operandi, in order to learn the systems for 
trafficking with the alkaloid, as well as its production and the 
processing sites. 
  EL ESPECTADOR had access to several intelligence analyses 
that, surprisingly, reveal that the Cali drug traffickers 
control 80 percent of the cocaine shipped abroad. 
  The reports demonstrate that the Cali Cartel specializes in 
coca growing and production, and, finally, its crystallization. 
According to the documents, that cartel was formerly purchasing 
basic cocaine paste in Peru and Bolivia but, for the past 
several years, has been producing its own coca. 
  These reports reveal that, in view of the offensive 
conducted 
by the Counternarcotics Police against the drug trafficking 
ring, the latter decided to transfer its laboratories and some 
of its members to Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil. 
  The police official queried claimed: "Ecuador has become a 
bridge for the Cali Cartel. Impressive amounts of the drugs 
confiscated have come from that country." 
  This statement corroborates the results of some operations 
against the international rings in which cocaine shipments 
loaded in Ecuadoran ports have been seized. 
  This year the most severe blow dealt to the Cali Cartel by 
the police forces of Colombia, Italy, and the United Kingdom was 
operation "Angelo II." In this operation, after extensive 
intelligence work lasting over four months, a cocaine shipment 
that had departed from Ecuador was discovered. 
  Ten persons were captured, including some of the principal 
liaisons in Colombia and abroad. The Counternarcotics Police 
director, Colonel Teodoro Campo Gomez, returned from Italy this 
weekend, and will submit a detailed report on the operation. 
<H5>  In Venezuela as Well </H5>
  Moreover, the drug traffickers have crossed the 
Colombian-Venezuelan border, engaging in their illicit 
activities from several of that country's jungle sites. 
  One of those Venezuelan locales discovered by the Colombian 
police is the site known as Puerto Ayacucho, where the Cali 
cartel is growing and processing coca for subsequent shipment to 
Europe. 
  The police reports indicate that Brazil has become another 
strategic point for the Cali Cartel. Its members are producing 
large volumes of cocaine there also. 
  Insofar as Colombia is concerned, only 5 percent of that 
drug 
is produced in Valle del Cauca; while 75 percent comes from the 
departments of Guaviare, Vichada, Vaupes, Meta, Casanare, Huila, 
Putumayo, Arauca, and Amazonas. Another large percentage is 
produced in Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil. 
  The reports note that, simultaneously with its cocaine 
trafficking, the Cali Cartel is laundering money in Argentina, 
Chile, and Panama. In this latter country, two business firms 
located in the Colon free trade zone are being investigated for 
laundering dollars on behalf of the Cali Cartel. 
  The investigators believe that, this year, the Cali Cartel 
will not be able to produce more than 20 percent of the cocaine. 
They claim that the operations being conducted are causing the 
members of that organization to tremble.

  [Text] San Jose, 19 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- A San Jose court has 
accepted a U.S. extradition request for Cuban citizen Huber 
Matos, charged with allegedly defrauding the U.S. Treasury. 
Huber Matos, who has lived in San Jose since January 1993, is 
the son of Cuban exile leader Huber Matos, owner of a San Jose 
radio station and head of the Independent and Democratic Cuba 
(CID) organization. 
  The extradition request, which was filed by the U.S. Embassy 
in Costa Rica, says that Matos and Juana Mayda Perez Batista are 
accused of "administration irregularities" of a Miami (USA) 
clinic. Judicial sources said the two Cubans have been charged 
with using "fraudulent methods'' against U.S. Government 
agencies to charge for fictitious or unnecessary services given 
to patients at a medical center in Miami. 
  According to the records filed with the Costa Rican court, 
Matos faces 21 criminal counts in southern Florida for money 
laundering, 49 for postal fraud, 24 for charging money with 
false documents, and one for conspiracy and violating federal 
laws. Federal Judge Barry Garber issued the U.S. arrest warrant 
against Matos on 23 June 1993. 
  The Costa Rican court handling the extradition request has 
imposed a precautionary measure on Matos banning him from 
leaving the country until a decision is made on his case. 
  A bilateral extradition treaty between Costa Rica and the 
United States exists. It was suspended in January 1993 when the 
Constitutionality Court declared several of its articles 
"unconstitutional."

replacing another general, George Joulwan. In his assumption of 
command speech, the new chief of this strategic territory stated 
among other things that terrorism and drug trafficking continue 
to undermine Latin American democracies. One can expect almost 
anything from a U.S. general (on active duty) except that he be 
so misinformed. Perhaps, however, McCaffrey's remarks were part 
of the profession of faith of the bullheaded U.S. military, 
whose only current mission seems to be meddling in the internal 
affairs of other countries while always seeking a pretext to 
conceal the ploy. 
  What fundamentally undermines the democracies in America is 
the indiscriminate implementation of neoliberal policies that 
have plunged the people into edginess over poverty and the 
possibility of losing their jobs. Despite being elements of 
destabilization, terrorism and drug trafficking have less 
bearing on the internal situation of the Latin American nations 
than the adjustment plans. Moreover, if indeed drug trafficking 
and terrorism stemming from drug trafficking played a key role 
in destabilizing governments, countries such as the United 
States would carry a large share of the responsibility, 
primarily because U.S. drug demand is the greatest in the world. 
  One really has to read between the lines in McCaffrey's 
speech--mainly when he says his purpose in the Southern Command 
is to continue establishing ties of cooperation in the entire 
Latin American region to promote and consolidate security. In 
general terms, those ties of cooperation take the form of 
dispatching U.S. troops from the Southern Command, which is 
headquartered in Panama, to various countries. Once there, they 
conduct missions of repression, such as the ones conducted 
periodically in Bolivia and other nations to eradicate the coca 
crop. 
  More often that not, U.S. soldiers conduct these tasks in 
the 
company of local troops. This is often a mere formality, 
because the one taking the lead in planning the repression is 
the U.S. side. In recent years, however, U.S. Army troops have 
tried to disguise their interventionist ploys using the pretext 
of social assistance--namely, the construction of bridges and 
roads and the repair of this or that rural school, tasks that do 
not hide their true intentions. Today, under different 
pretexts, U.S. troops are deployed in remote and rugged areas of 
Latin American nations. The speech about cooperation does not 
deceive anyone today, because the United States has always had 
the ambition to control everything in our nations. 
  In addition, Gen. McCaffrey, whose past is linked to U.S. 
military intervention in Vietnam and Iraq, knows he is the 
appropriate figure to hold the post of chief of the Southern 
Command. Fortunately, the meddling incursions of the U.S. 
military from the Southern Command will exist for only five more 
years, because on 31 December 1999, the Torrijos-Carter treaties 
signed in 1977 should begin to take effect, which will put an 
end to the U.S. presence in Panama and will return the nation's 
interoceanic waterway to the Panamanians.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eliseo Zamora (not further identified) by </F>
mobile unit reporter Mariela Diaz; date and place not given; 
monitored in progress--live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Zamora] ...the United States of America and the 
South American drug producing countries decided that traffickers 
should be forced to violate our air space occasionally, and 
sometimes our jurisdictional waters, when choosing the fastest 
route. 
  [Diaz] Does this mean that drugs are brought to Cuba either 
by plane or by boat? And how far off the Cuban coast are these 
packages dropped? 
  [Zamora] As you said, they try to violate our airspace and 
our jurisdictional waters. Of course, we always try to take 
appropriate steps to prevent such elements from violating our 
waters and our airspace. And as I was telling you, although our 
territory is not internally affected by drug trafficking or drug 
consumption and is free of organized criminal groups dedicated 
to international drug trafficking activities, Cuba keeps as a 
priority the battle against this evil--the battle against those 
actions that seek to use our jurisdictional waters and our 
airspace for illegal drug trafficking operations, or as shelter 
to avoid the antidrug forces that persecute them in neighboring 
countries. Thus, when our nation is enduring a serious economic 
crisis, the product of the double blockade against our country, 
our government's response to this evil remains solid and firm. 
  [Diaz] Your explanation is very clear; but this is a country 
with an economic crisis, and I believe this could lead to a 
social crisis. Worse yet would be that such evils proliferate in 
our country. My question to you was about Cuba's real situation 
concerning drug consumption and trafficking. 
  [Zamora] As you know very well, from the very beginning the 
Revolution has provided everything to our citizens so they can 
develop all their potentials in the educational, cultural, 
scientific, and technical fields. And this has prevented our 
citizens from expressing any interest or need to resort to the 
drug phenomenon. This is the basic reason, and often our friends 
abroad cannot understand it because they cannot conceive that 
this problem does not exist in Cuba. But we who live in the 
fatherland know that this is true, and that the Revolution is 
the basic element that has helped us stay away from this evil 
that is adversely affecting mankind. 
  [Diaz] Precisely. Roughly, how many criminal actions were 
reported in 1993? Can you provide those figures? 
  [Zamora] By all means. To have an idea of the scope of this 
international phenomenon, in 1993 a total of 3,3364 kg of 
cocaine were seized in 79 different operations, which is an 
increase of 104 percent as compared to 1992. These drugs are 
dropped in packages through a system called plane bombing, then 
are collected by fast boats. In 72 cases these drugs were found 
on the Cuban coast or floating on waters near Cuban territory. 
And 27 kg were seized from traffickers who were either trying to 
carry the drug into the country or out of the country. The final 
destination of these drugs was the European countries and 
Canada; but, of course, the objective was the use of our 
airports. 
  [Diaz] On another occasion I will continue talking with 
Eliseo Zamora about the National Drug Commission founded in Cuba 
in 1989. I know there are people in their homes who are still 
willing to listen to us, especially when dealing with such 
important subjects as this one.

<F P=106> [Report by Hector Aguilar; from the "Good Morning From </F>
Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Attorney General's Office in 
north Quintana Roo have reported that in a joint operation with 
the Mexican Navy the authorities seized almost 1.5 tons of pure 
Colombian cocaine base packed in 61 packages contained in 24 
bundles. 
  This seizure, which can be described as the most important 
so 
far this year, took place approximately 80 km from Cancun, on 
the beaches of Acumal, where the bundles were dropped into the 
sea from an aircraft. Apparently, the bundles were to be 
illegally transshipped in a 30-meter-long fiberglass boat that 
had a radio with a marine band and other frequencies. 
  The boat and the cocaine are under Navy guard in Cozumel. 
The Federal Judicial Police are investigating the origin of the 
cocaine.

<F P=106> [By Julian Rodriguez Marin] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 20 Feb (EFE) -- The Mexican Government 
dealt a severe blow to drug trafficking in 1993 by seizing over 
500 tons of drugs, ranging from cocaine to ephedrine, and 
confiscating thousands of weapons, vehicles, and two dozen 
planes, according to the Attorney General's Office (PGR). 
  The data supplied to EFE indicate that last year authorities 
seized 45 tons of cocaine, 404.2 tons of marijuana, 59.8 tons of 
heroin, 83.1 tons of opium, 1.6 tons of ephedrine, and 
confiscated 1,567 weapons, 1,793 vehicles, and 24 aircraft. In 
addition, according to the PGR, 11,489 hectares of marijuana 
plantations and 3,500 hectares of poppy plantations were 
destroyed. The report added that 6,804 persons from Mexico and 
29 persons from other countries were arrested for drug-related 
offenses, while 25 police officers were killed in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. 
  Among the most reputed mafias controlling the production and 
distribution of narcotics in Mexico are the "cartels" of the 
Mexican cities of Juarez, Tijuana, Matamoros, Sinaloa, and 
Jalisco. 
  From Ciudad Juarez on the northern border, the "Cartel of 
Juarez"--one of the oldest drug rings--takes drugs into the 
United States through the "central route," which runs from the 
States of Oaxaca to Coahuila and is linked to Colombia's 
Medellin Cartel. Its main "capos" were brothers Eduardo and 
Rafael Munoz Talavera (both of whom are imprisoned). Carlos 
Tapia Anchondo, Carlos Enrique Tapia Ponce, and Cuahutemoc Ortiz 
are now in charge. 
  The chief kingpins of the "Sinaloa Cartel" are Joaquin "El 
Chapo" Guzman and Luis "El Guero" Palma. Guzman was arrested in 
connection with the death of Cardinal Jesus Posadas Ocampo on 24 
May 1993 at the Guadalajara airport. 
  The "Tijuana Cartel" has an area of influence throughout the 
Baja California Peninsula and its "capos" are brothers Ramon and 
Francisco Arellano Felix. One is under arrest, and the other is 
wanted in connection with the shooting of Cardinal Posadas. 
  The "Jalisco Cartel" operates in the States of Jalisco, 
Nayarit, and Colima. One of its leaders was Rafael Caro 
Quintero and it is now run by Caro Quintero's relatives Emilio 
Quintero Payan and Juan Jose Quintero, who are devoted to 
marijuana production although they also traffic in cocaine. 
  The "Matamoros Cartel" or "Gulf Cartel" operates in the Gulf 
of Mexico area. It brings marijuana and cocaine into the United 
States through Matamoros, and its leader is Juan Garcia Abrego. 
  Mexican authorities have detected various routes for drug 
trafficking. The "central" route originates in Colombia from 
where the drugs are transported by air to the northern states. 
The "Pacific" route originates in Colombia from where the drugs 
are taken by air to Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero. Next they are 
transported by sea to the United States. The "Caribbean-Gulf of 
Mexico" route originates in Colombia and leads to Guatemala and 
Belize. It then goes through Yucatan and travels the gulf coast 
to Tamaulipas. Finally, the "Pacific Coast" route reaches the 
State of Guerrero through the Pacific Coast. 
  The mafias are competing for the enormous U.S. market, 
where--according to official reports--revenues from drug 
trafficking reach $52 billion annually. 
  According to a PGR report, in 1992 gross revenues from drug 
trafficking in Mexico represented an amount equal to the net 
foreign currency revenues for Mexican petroleum and nonpetroleum 
exports, plus the value of maquiladoras in 1990. Most of this 
money stays outside Mexican territory. According to reports from 
1992, the number of drug addicts in Mexico is less than two 
million people. Forty percent of them smoke marijuana, while 
heroin and cocaine consumers total 3.4 percent. The remaining 
addicts are addicted to other drugs such as sedatives, 
amphetamines, analgesics, and drugs that are inhaled.

  [Text] The spread of coca plantations to southern Peru and 
the processing of cocaine paste have increased drug trafficking 
near Bolivia and Brazil. It necessarily follows that cocaine 
should get to consumer markets via new routes. 
  This information--which was provided by an international 
probe into narcotics control--together with the analysis of the 
data submitted by drug enforcement agencies in Paraguay have led 
to the conclusion that our country would be the new cocaine 
route. 
  The National Police's Narcotics Department and the National 
Narcotics Directorate [Dinar] are investigating this new route 
and all the evidence seems to indicate that the drug enters the 
country via the Paraguay River and is transported to a port, 
possibly Concepcion, or another located further upstream. 
  The National Police's Narcotics Department has sent 
personnel 
to Fuerte Olimpo to check a shipment of Brazilian cigarettes 
that were consigned to our country from Zarate Port, Bolivia. 
  This drew the attention of the police authorities as the 
expense involved in transporting the cigarette shipment via the 
Transchaco Highway to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, and from 
there to Zarate Port, where it is loaded into a motorboat that 
goes downstream in the direction of Concepcion is totally 
unjustified. 
  Following the exodus of authorities from Bahia Negra, the 
place is an ideal "post" for drug traffickers to send 
cocaine--which presumably comes from Colombia rather than from 
Santa Cruz de la Sierra--to the Pedro Juan Caballero cocaine 
cartel. 
  This new, small-scale cartel allegedly used this route to 
bring 150 kg of cocaine hydrochloride into the country at the 
end of last week. The Dinar and the National Police's Narcotics 
Department are currently delving into this issue. It is 
surmised that the shipment is already in Pedro Juan Caballero, 
the capital of Amambay Department. 
  There are concrete data to the effect that chemical products 
for processing cocaine are given in exchange for the drug. 
Ether, acetone, and hydrochloric acid come from Brazil through 
Bella Vista and are transported to Concepcion, from where they 
are allegedly shipped to Bolivia. The lack of transport, 
communications, and checkpoints enables the drug traffickers to 
continue their business unhampered.

  [Text] According to an official communique issued by the 
Supreme Military Justice Council, Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, 
alias El Vaticano, Peru's most powerful drug trafficker, was 
sentenced today by a military court to life imprisonment. He 
will serve this sentence at the Callao Naval Base where he will 
be Abimael Guzman's neighbor. 
  According to a document circulated today by the Supreme 
Military Justice Council, Chavez was sentenced to life and will 
serve it at the maximum security prison at the Callao Naval 
Base, possibly in a cell next to or near terrorist leader 
Abimael Guzman Reynoso. 
  Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, alias El Vaticano, has 
been condemned for treason against the fatherland and the state, 
but he will be tried for illegal drug trafficking in a civilian 
court. El Vaticano, however, will not go to the Justice Palace 
offices. Instead, the penal judge will go to the naval base 
installations just as has already been done once, according to 
information given by a military spokesmen. 
  El Vaticano was captured in Cali, Colombia, where he was 
living. According to what has been established, however, he 
continued handling the drug business in the Peruvian jungle. 
The criminal, who is now serving a life sentence, was 
considered Peru's most powerful drug trafficker due to the 
amount of drugs he collected and shipped to Colombia to be 
converted into cocaine for subsequent shipment to the U.S. and 
European markets.

  [Text] A bill presented by the executive branch to the CCD 
[Democratic Constituent Congress] seriously punishing the 
cultivation of poppy has just suffered its first defeat in legal 
experts' circles. According to the bill, the sentences range 
between 12 and 20 years of imprisonment and there is no room for 
procedural benefits. In the Andean Jurists Commission's (CAJ) 
opinion, this openly contradicts the so-called "Fujimori thesis" 
that was included in the 1991 penal code and no longer 
classifies cultivation as a drug trafficking crime. The 
executive branch's bill intends to radically eradicate this 
fairly new crop. The CAJ claims that if peasants raise this 
crop, it will be because its price is competitive and not 
because of fraudulent intention. The CAJ also claims that the 
punishment will not be a deterrent as long as poverty in the 
area prevails. The CAJ claims that the punishment might, 
rather, contribute to increasing prices and cases of corruption 
and abuse by producers, and an overwhelming growth in the prison 
population.

  [Text] PNP [Peruvian National Police] intelligence sources 
disclosed that Wilber Alvarado Linares, aka Champa, one of the 
main drug dealers in the Upper Huallaga, allegedly has taken the 
place of Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, as 
the main drug supplier for the Cali cartel. 
  Moreover, the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, barons of the 
cartel, allegedly have chosen to contact Champa to try to 
recover the advance they paid Vaticano to buy white cocaine 
paste. 
  According to our sources, the arrest of Vaticano in Cali, 
Colombia, will represent a hard blow to the Rodriguez Orejuelas' 
"economy" if they fail to identify the "buyers" who received an 
advance for the purchase of a "large quantity" of drugs. 
  Other traffickers such as "Camboya," "Escorpio," "Santena," 
"Joselito," "Chuquin," "Mecano," "Tico," "Nano," etc., who also 
have "interests" in the Upper Huallaga might also be affected 
for having given Vaticano an advance of several thousands of 
dollars. 
  In this regard, it was learned that Elias Chavez 
Penaherrera, 
aka Lan, who is Vaticano's brother and the pilot of his private 
aircraft, may take Vaticano's place because he knows his 
"contacts" and probably the drug buyers who received the advance 
payment from the Cali cartel. 
  Moreover, the National Intelligence Service has discovered 
that Vaticano and the aforementioned drug traffickers had their 
operations center in the Upper Huallaga, Palma Pampa, Ramal de 
Aspuzana, Huicungo, "Boca de Diablo," Bellavista, and Bolognesi 
Province. 
  As for Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, it was learned 
that the Intelligence Services as well as Dinandro [Anti-Drug 
Division] are after several of his front men whose names are 
being kept secret and other people also involved in drug 
trafficking.

  [Text] Although it is the first time since 1904 the United 
States has admitted that drug trafficking is also a U.S. 
domestic problem, expectations regarding the U.S. Government's 
change of attitude regarding countries such as Peru and Bolivia 
are not very encouraging because "in their capacity as 
producers, they will be abandoned to their fate; they will be 
given no aid and no importance will be granted to alternative 
development crops (for coca leaves)". 
  This statement was made on 10 February by the UN expert on 
drug affairs and agricultural development, Iban de Rementeria, 
who said the change in the anti-drug strategy announced on 9 
February by U.S. President Bill Clinton represents a "complete 
change in U.S. anti-drug policy." 
  De Rementeria said: "Since 1904 the United States has 
maintained that drugs are a foreign problem. This is the first 
time they have admitted it is a domestic problem. This is a 
step forward because they admit that it is a health and 
educational problem and not just a police issue." 
  The UN official believes this change of attitude regarding 
the drug problem was promoted by the failure of the U.S. 
administration's anti-drug policy, which during the past few 
years cost more than $10 billion per year. 
  "Drug consumption in the United States has really not 
dropped. During the past six years the number of consumers has 
remained more or less the same," he said as he commented that it 
is estimated there are 10 million cocaine and marijuana addicts 
in the United States. 
  In referring to Clinton's new strategy, de Rementeria said: 
"We must not have illusions because we remain alone in this 
field." 
  From his viewpoint, the importance of reducing or 
substituting coca crops has become a secondary issue. 
  De Rementeria added: "I do not see how we can plan an 
alternative development program with the current international 
agricultural policies if the GATT Uruguay Round has 
institutionalized subsidies in developed countries and this 
condemns agriculture in the Third World to failure."

  The idea is to emphasize prevention rather than repression 
which, generally speaking, has been used since, or even before 
the tenure of President George Bush. 
  One reason for the change of strategy is that the one used 
so 
far has proven ineffective and only increased the number of 
consumers by an average of 140,000 new addicts per year to the 
incredible current number of 10 million consumers. 
  At the same time as it announced the so-called New National 
Antinarcotics Strategy, the White House also asked the U.S. 
Congress to approve a $13.2-billion allocation to implement this 
program. This includes a substantial increase in the funds 
earmarked for cooperation with drug producer countries. 
  This directly concerns us because Peru is the world's 
biggest 
coca leaf producer and the money allocated for cooperation is 
earmarked for eradicating plantations and destroying 
laboratories. 
  U.S. Government officials have said that this money--which 
will not reach Peru or Bolivia until October--will also be used 
to strengthen the Peruvian and Bolivian judicial systems and to 
train their respective specialized police units. 
  Despite a relative increase, and the strategy implemented in 
Peru, the main changes by U.S. officials do not seem positive. 
  Iban de Rementeria--a UN expert in narcotics affairs and 
agricultural development who termed the U.S. strategy "a 
complete turn around"--has stated that although it is right that 
the United States has admitted for the first time since 1904 
that the drug problem is a domestic problem, there are other 
aspects that reveal faults in the new strategy as far as our 
countries are concerned. 
  Rementeria said: "There should be no illusions because we 
continue alone in this field," adding that prospects for Peru 
and Bolivia are not good because "in their capacity as producers 
they will be abandoned to their fate, they will be given no aid, 
and no importance will be granted to the alternative development 
crops." 
  To a certain extent, the current international agricultural 
policies upheld by the GATT are even more serious because the 
recent Uruguay Round has institutionalized the subsidy system in 
developed countries, condemning agriculture in the Third World 
"to failure." 
  Bolivian Chamber of Deputies President Guillermo Bedregal 
has 
mentioned the serious social conflicts that would be unleashed 
in his country following a cut in the alternative development 
program. 
  As we can see, it is not just a matter of a mere 
substitution 
of plantations, which to a great extent has failed because a 
series of complementary aspects--such as guaranteeing peasants 
access to market--were overlooked. 
  Alternative development is what is sought and needed now; so 
that the coca grower's problems will be tackled in a 
comprehensive way, that the peasant will by no means be regarded 
as a delinquent or an accomplice, but merely a producer with 
limited possibilities and without an "alternative"--for the time 
being--to survive. 
  The solution to the immensely complex trafficking problem 
must, therefore, contemplate the problem of the peasants--who 
are on many occasions involuntarily and exploited producers of 
the raw material--whose needs and interests must also be 
considered.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Ignacio Mayorca] </F>
  [Text] During a news conference in the presence of the 100 
members of the Inter-American Defense College's [CID] Class 33 
currently visiting Venezuela, Brigadier General Alvaro Rafael 
Barboza Rodriguez, Joint Staff operations director, reported 
that between 50 and 60 tons of various drugs circulate through 
Venezuela annually. 
  The CID director and U.S. Army Major Gen. James Harding said 
that the students come from 14 countries on the continent. CID 
courses last 10 months, beginning in July. "This is an 
opportunity to exchange views and get to know these countries a 
little better. It is a very simple project." he said. 
  In halting Spanish, Maj. Harding said that according to data 
supplied by CID and the Inter-American Defense Board, which he 
leads also, terrorism and drug trafficking are the major threats 
to the continent's security. "We should strive jointly to find a 
solution to the drug trafficking problem, which goes beyond 
borders and helps the entire world. The cooperation of all 
governments is required," he said. 
  In the morning Harding paid a courtesy visit to Defense 
Minister General Rafael Montero Revette. The CID members will 
fly to Colombia on Thursday. 
  Gen. Barboza, former commander of the Venezuela unit which 
operated in Honduras and Nicaragua on pacification duties, was 
selected by the Defense Ministry to make a general assessment of 
the "military situation" in Venezuela. He described as a threat 
the use of Venezuela as "a springboard for the traffic of drugs 
to Central America and their final destination, the United 
States." An estimate of the quantity of drugs circulating 
through Venezuela was made by the National Guard. "Only 10 
percent of this quantity is seized. This gives an idea of the 
seriousness of the problem," he said. He also reported on the 
discovery of marijuana and coca plantations in the Perija 
Mountains and areas close to the Colombian border. Money 
laundering "has been detected essentially in four areas: 
Tachira; Zulia, near Maicao; Caracas, through real estate 
operations; and the country's eastern region," he said. 
  He recalled that the most successful years in the 
counternarcotics struggle were 1991 and 1992, when 11.981 tons 
and 12.681 tons, respectively, were confiscated. In 1993 the 
drug seizure level again was close to three tons, a figure 
similar to that of 1990. Cocaine is the most often confiscated 
drug. Next comes marijuana, 400 kilos of which are seized 
annually. "The fact that heroin is entering the local market 
again is worrisome," he said. 
  The UN believes this is a worldwide problem. The number of 
involved countries has risen from 64 in 1990 to 138 in the first 
half of 1993. 
  Gen. Barboza announced that this year the Armed Forces will 
put two flight control radar sites in operation. One of them 
will be located in Falcon State and cover the country's central 
and western region. The other, located in Nueva Esparta, will 
serve to monitor flights between the country's central and 
eastern regions. These sites are being installed through 
agreements with U.S. counternarcotics agencies, such as DEA, 
CIA, and others. "These sites will be operated jointly with our 
Armed Forces," he said. 
  This illegal activity can be monitored more by effectively 
by 
observing the flight patterns of the drug traffickers' planes, 
that is to say, speed, altitude, time, and routes, as well as 
the types of planes used. A special overflight program, 
originating in Panama and reaching Peru and Bolivia with 
observers aboard, is being set up. Special surveillance 
operations can be conducted on the request of the Venezuelan 
Government or the U.S. Southern Command authorities.

  [Text] Guangzhou, February 18 (CNS)--The Guangdong 
Department of Public Security successfully cracked a big 
drug-trafficking ring composed of drug traffickers from Hong 
Kong, Guangdong, Yunnan and Guangxi with the arrest of 26 
suspects including three Hong Kong persons, seizing 17,400 grams 
of heroin, RMB [renminbi] 1.2 million in cash and a number of 
instruments for the processing of drugs. 
  Police in Zhaoqing carried out an undercover action on 
November 2 last year after learning that drug traffickers from 
Hong Kong had gone there with a big amount of money for trading 
drugs with a local drug-dealer at his luxury residence. The 
police launched a raid on the drug-traffickers early the 
following early morning when the four suspects appeared outside 
the house carrying bulging bags. They were arrested and 7,500 
grams of heroin were found in the bags. The police also 
captured three other suspects inside the house and discovered 
RMB 620,000 in cash which had been brought there by the Hong 
Kong suspects as well as 8,700 grams of heroin. 
  The police went on the same day to arrest two other suspects 
who had sneaked into Shenzhen from Hong Kong and were found to 
be accomplices in the drug-trafficking. Two more hideouts for 
the drug trade were smashed in the urban area of Zhaoqing with 
five drug-traffickers arrested. 
  Further raids were later carried out in Yunnan, Guangxi and 
Luoding in Guangdong with the ring-leader together with six 
suspects being captured. The drug ring was wiped out with the 
elimination of the drug route by which the drugs were first 
brought in from Yunnan and transported to Zhaoqing in Guangdong 
via Guangxi for later shipment to Hong Kong drug dealers.

  [Text] A foreign tourist illegally carrying more than 120 
grams of marijuana was arrested at the Shoudu Airport's security 
inspection station. This is the first time that the station has 
cracked a case of a passenger carrying marijuana. 
  At about 1930 on 28 January, when this passenger was 
undergoing a security inspection, the exit alarm bell went off. 
Li Jianhua, an inspector at the second section of the security 
inspection, found that the cigarette cases that the passenger 
carried were full of a solid yellow material and another 
cigarette case had six cigarettes without tobacco inside. 
Through the laboratory test, the customhouse maintained that 
the solid yellow substance is marijuana. 
  This passenger is from Canada and his name is Bhagg. He is a 
foreign teacher at a certain institute in Beijing. He carried 
the marijuana and attempted to take it himself. 
  On 1719 on 31 January, the security inspection station of 
the 
Shoudu International Airport discovered another passenger 
illegally carrying marijuana. 
  The alarm went off when the passenger went through the 
international personal safety inspection section. Inspector 
Gong Fanying found 20 grams of marijuana in his socks. This 
passenger was from Xinjiang. He planned to take flight No. TK 
753 on the same evening to Turkey via Pakistan. It was reported 
that this is the fourth case [as published] of illegal 
possession of narcotics discovered at the security inspection 
station of the Shoudu International Airport.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Up to 2,000 Moslem youths 
staged an anti-American demonstration in front of the US Embassy 
here Tuesday, accusing it of involvement in drug trafficking and 
of anti-Moslem policies. 
  "We demand an apology from the US government over the 
involvement of its two diplomatic staff in the crime of drug 
trafficking," said members of the group, which claims to belong 
to the Front for Indonesian Youths Saviour. 
  One leader, haranguing the crowd through a megaphone, said 
the United States was influencing Indonesian youth with what he 
called a destructive culture, was unfair towards the Moslem 
world and was always forcing its interests on others. 
  "America, out ... America, AIDS ... America, narcotics ..." 
the crowd alternately yelled, as well as calling for the hanging 
of the two embassy staff. 
  The crowd, which according to police estimates numbered 
2,000 
people, delivered a statement to the US Embassy. 
  The embassy's spokesman was not available for comment. 
  The demonstration leader also blamed the unrealization of 
the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's (NATO) threat to launch an 
airstrike on Serbian positions in Bosnia on pressures from 
Washington. 
  Washington, he said, was also trying to pressure Indonesia, 
the world's largest Moslem-populated nation, to open ties with 
Israel. 
  Indonesia, with about 88 percent of its 186 million 
population following Islam, is a staunch supporter of the 
Palestinian and Arab cause, and has no diplomatic ties with 
Israel. 
  Reading out parts of the statement handed to the embassy, 
they also accused US diplomats [of] "contempt for Indonesian 
laws," for sending two embassy staff members, accused last month 
of drug trafficking, to the United States last week. 
  The embassy has said the men would be court martialed in the 
United States. 
  The demonstrators demanded that the two Americans, 
identified 
as Joseph Bryner and Michael Karajin, be returned to Indonesia 
for trial and that the embassy apologize for their conduct. 
  The two, one holding diplomatic immunity, were among four 
foreigners and two Indonesian nabbed by the police here for 
their alleged involvement in the trade of a dangerous drug, 
known as Ecstasy. 
  The group, also said Washington needs to be fair and honest 
in viewing the rise of Islam and its followers and avoid the 
influence of the Jewish lobby when determining its foreign 
policy. 
  The group dispersed peacefully by themselves before police 
made any move to end the demonstration. There were no arrests, 
witnesses said.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 22 (ANTARA) -- Thousands of students 
from Jakarta and Bandung staged a demonstration in front of the 
US Embassy here Tuesday, on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue and the 
recent drug trafficking involving two staff members of the 
embassy. 
  "We insist that the US Government apologize over the 
involvement of its diplomatic staff in illegal-drug dealing," 
said the protesters, calling themselves the Salvation Front for 
Indonesia's Youth Generation (FPGMI). 
  They also accused the US Government for influencing 
Indonesian youths with its "destructive culture", being unfair 
towards the Islamic world and forcing its interest on others. 
  "The inconsistencies of the US in upholding justice and 
truth 
are reflected in its double-standard policy toward Islamic 
world," they claimed. 
  The demonstrators interspersed anti-American chants with 
shoutings of "God is great" and sang a march. 
  "US Embassy: we sell xtc (ecstasy), narcotics and morphine", 
"USA satellite of Zionism" and "Nato and USA are cowards, not 
heroes," said the banner and poster totting crowd. 
  Two protesters then delivered a copy of their statement to 
an 
embassy staff, while the others peacefully and voluntarily 
dispersed before the police could make any moves to end the 
demonstration, which occurred in less than an hour. 
  In the statement, the demonstrators demanded that the US 
Government honor and respect Indonesia's law and sovereignty by 
not abusing their priviledges. 
  They also insisted that the US act honestly and fairly 
towards the Islamic world as well as refrain from using trade 
and economic issues for their own interests. 
  In addition, they wanted the two members of staff caught in 
drug trafficking, Steven J. Bryner and Peter M. Karajin III, to 
be tried under Indonesian law. The two US diplomats who were 
arrested by the Indonesian authorities for the alleged drug 
trafficking, were recently brought back to the United States by 
the DEA officials. 
  There were no arrests in the demonstration, witnesses said.

<F P=106> [By Widi Yarmanto, Yuli Ismartono, Ivan Haris, Kukuh </F>
Karsadi, and Rihad Wiranto] 
  [Text] The persistent press reports on the proliferation of 
narcotics in our country have inspired our police to work hard. 
They have now successfully arrested two Dutch and two U.S. 
nationals believed to be involved in trafficking Ecstasy (XTC) 
pills. Police are also investigating whether the arrest is 
related to the case of Ria Irawan [Jakarta actress whose friend 
died of a drug overdose in her house]. 
  Addressing the parliament's Commission I [Roman numeral 
one], 
Police Major General M. Hindarto, head of Jakarta Metropolitan 
Police, said the suspects were apprehended at the Borobudur 
Hotel on Sunday night [13 February] last week. A total of 7,575 
Ecstasy pills were seized from them. 
  The two Dutch nationals are Christian van den Bosch and 
Leonard Jacobus. They have been detained at the Jakarta 
Metropolitan Police headquarters since last Thursday. The two 
other suspects are Americans, namely Steven Joseph Bryner, 25, 
and Peter Michael Karajin, 25. They are not diplomats, but Air 
Force sergeants in charge of the postal service or Army Post 
Office [APO, three preceding words in English] who are accorded 
diplomatic status at the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. 
  The two Americans are in charge of handling packages and 
letters to and from the United States via U.S. military 
aircraft. The U.S. Embassy dismissed reports that the two had 
received the dangerous pills through the APO facility and 
claimed that the pills had been sent through the regular postal 
service. 
  Before the Indonesian Government declared the two Americans 
undesirable persons, the U.S. Embassy hurriedly sent them home 
on Thursday night [17 February] last week. The two sergeants 
will reportedly be handed over to the U.S. authorities to face a 
court-martial. 
  Regardless of the issue of whether it is proper for the 
suspects to be tried there, the U.S. authorities apparently want 
to show their gratitude by sending several DEA officers based in 
a certain Asian country to Jakarta to work together with the 
Indonesian counterparts to break up the drug syndicate. 
  However, Sabam Sirait, a member of Parliament's Commission 
I, 
expressed regret for the repatriation of the two U.S. nationals. 
"They should have been tried in Indonesia," he said. Another 
TEMPO source said: "If this had taken place in Singapore or 
Malaysia, they would have faced the gallows." 
  The suspects admitted that thousands of such dangerous pills 
had been imported from the Netherlands. They had also been in 
operation since 1992. In Jakarta, they used to sell these pills 
to foreigners or yuppies [preceding word in English]. One pill 
costs between 60,000 to 200,000 rupiah. It is not surprising 
that there is a surge in the use of narcotics in Jakarta. This 
was disclosed by Maj. Gen. Hindarto to parliament, adding that 
there was a 93-percent increase in 1993 compared to the previous 
year. 
  As for the two Dutch nationals, it is not yet clear whether 
they will be charged under the Narcotics or the Health Act. "If 
it turns out that the pills do not contain addictive substances, 
they will be charged under the Health Act, which bans the import 
of dangerous medicine without the health minister's permit," 
said a police officer. 
  The Health Act No. 23/1992 bans the production or 
distribution of unlicensed medicine or medicinal ingredients. 
Offenders face a maximum imprisonment of 15 years or 
300-million-rupiah fine. 
  How intensive is our police's knowledge of the drug 
distribution network in Indonesia? Both Lieutenant Colonel A. 
Latief Rabar, chief of the Jakarta Metropolitan Police's 
Information Service, and Colonel Hari Sutanto, chief of the 
Police Headqaurters' Information Service, admit they know little 
about it. 
  However, a TEMPO source, a student who often buys Inex 
[expansion unknown] pills said firmly that Christian van den 
Bosch was the distributor of the pills. The network had one 
Eurasian assistant, but after the arrival of Sergeant Steve, it 
became more effective and coordinated. The pills were stored in 
his house in the Kebayoran Baru area. 
  The pills were mailed in neat packages from the Netherlands, 
and they safely arrived at the address of two foreigners who 
worked at a prominent English-language school in Kebayoran Baru, 
South Jakarta. The pills were then distributed, with some being 
delivered to fashion models, homosexual and lesbian groups, and 
company executives. In this money-soaked business, there are 
rules to be observed: For example, fellow distributors cannot 
cheat one another. There are also ethical rules: A distributor 
cannot be a consumer, otherwise he will be heavily indebted to 
the main distributor. For example, a man called Nonon owed 
Christian about 40 million rupiah. As he is unable to pay the 
debt, Nonon has now "disapppeared." It is not clear whether he 
is hiding or if he has been finished off in line with the law of 
the jungle in this business. 
  Besides the Christian-Steve syndicate, there is also the 
Johnson group. This Caucasian man often shuttles the 
Jakarta-Bali route. In Jakarta, he often operates in several 
nightclubs. Johnson is believed to be distributing not only 
Ecstasy pills, but also hashish, ganja sticks, and cocaine. A 
TEMPO source said: "Johnson is certainly involved in the 
Colombian connection". 
  With the assistance of the DEA, our police are expected to 
get to the root of the problem, which has caused great distress 
to society.

  [Text] Jakarta (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--Detectives of POLDA 
METRO JAYA [Metropolitan Jakarta Regional Police] have snared 
two groups of dried marijuana distributors who had attempted to 
distribute 50 kilograms of the illicit substance in the Jakarta 
area. The two apprehended groups consist of eight people, two of 
whom are women and two of whom are college students. 
  This information was presented Tuesday [25 January] by 
Colonel (Police) Drs. Gunawan, chief of the POLDA METRO JAYA 
Detective Service, who was accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel 
(Police) A. Latief Rabar, chief of the Regional Police 
Information Agency. Gunawan acknowledged that, thanks to 
information from the community, the two groups had been under 
officer surveillance since November 1993. 
  The first group, which had a Medan-Jakarta network, was 
raided on 2 January at the house of distributor B.A.K., alias 
Empek (39), a resident of Engsek Lane, RT [Neighborhood] 001/02, 
Tambun Village, Bekasi. B.A.K. confessed that he obtained the 
substance from Mrs. Amb. (42), a housewife residing at Pondok 
Ungu, RT 001/07, Medan Satria Ward, Bekasi. 
  Mrs. Amb. confessed that she had been distributing marijuana 
for a long time from supplies brought overland by Mrs. Leg., 
alias Inang (42), a housewife residing at Jl. Jemadi, Lane VI, 
Pulobayan, Medan. 
  Besides arresting the three members of this group, officers 
seized 30 kilograms of dried marijuana ready for sale. "We are 
still looking for two Medan members of the ring," Gunawan 
revealed. 
<H5>  Two College Students </H5>
  Gunawan said that when officers raided the second group, 
which had an Aceh-Medan-Jakarta network, on Thursday, 20 
January, at its rented headquarters at 10B Percetakan Negara 
Street, Rawasari Ward, Central Jakarta, they apprehended four 
members and seized 20 kilograms of dried marijuana. 
  Some group members said that a shipment consisting of a 
similar amount was to be delivered by a person the next day. 
Upon hearing that, the officers blockaded the site. Therefore, 
when A.R. bin A.G. (36), a farmer residing at Ujung Padang, 
Labuhanhaji, Aceh, arrived Friday morning, 21 January, carrying 
a suitcase containing 10 kilograms of marijuana, he was 
immediately apprehended. 
  The four members arrested on Thursday were Teuku M.A. (30), 
a 
merchant residing in Dayaklabu Village, Pidi, Aceh; Sdm. (29), a 
state college student from Meredu, Pidi, Aceh; Skr. (29), a 
driver from Rakyat Street, Kadura Lane, Medan; and Teuku Zul. 
(30), a private college student from Mesanak Vilage, Sigli City, 
Aceh. "The two members who were students had reached their 
eighth semesters," Gunawan disclosed. 
  According to statements by the members, the marijuana 
distributed by the Aceh-Medan-Jakarta group was brought to 
Jakarta by parcel truck. Gunawan also revealed that Mrs. Amb.'s 
group was in the same group with Mrs. Panj., who was arrested in 
Medan some time ago for possession of 113 kilograms of marijuana.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 2 January--The effort to prevent drug 
addiction by education, which has been under way in the country 
for the past 10 years, is showing encouraging success. This was 
stated by Lee Lam Thye, vice president of Pemadam Kebangsaan 
[National Drug Prevention Program]. 
  According to him, the rate of drug addiction, that is, the 
number of new drug abusers, has fallen by more than 50 percent, 
based on a study published by the Pasukan Petugas Anti-Dadah 
[PPAD--Anti-Drug Detachment] in the Office of the Prime Minister. 
  In a New Year's statement issued on 2 January he said: "In 
1983 the PPAD registered 14,624 new addicts, whereas in 1993 the 
total number declined, as 6,797 new addicts were registered." 
  However, in the 1990's the drug addiction prevention effort 
using education needs to concentrate on the problem of repeat 
offenders. 
  He said: "In 1993 10,637 repeat offenders were registered 
throughout the country, or 61 percent of all drug addicts 
recorded." 
  Lee said that for this reason the drug rehabilitation effort 
needs to be supported by parents whose children are addicted to 
drugs. 
  He said: "The community must also show a high level of 
commitment to welcoming drug addicts who have come to their 
senses." 
  Beginning in 1994, the National Drug Prevention Program will 
increase its efforts to help the government in its war on drugs. 
  He said: "This is in accordance with the objective adopted 
by 
nongovernment organizations (NGO) of helping the government 
resolve the social problems of the community." 
  According to Lee, the National Drug Prevention Program will 
increase its preventive educational programs by establishing a 
rehabilitation service program for former drug addicts who have 
been released from treatment centers. 
  He stated: "The National Drug Prevention Program hopes to be 
able to set up a larger number of rehabilitation service centers 
throughout the country to help former addicts return to the 
community." 
  Lee said that the National Drug Prevention Program wants the 
people to participate in the war against drug addiction by 
carrying on preventive educational programs in the community. 
  Furthermore, the people should support former addicts by 
giving them an opportunity to return to the community.

  [Text] Kota Bharu, 28 December--Yahya Agil, a land 
development agent who worked for FELDA [Federal Land Development 
Authority], was sentenced to death on 28 December by the High 
Court in Kota Bharu after he was found guilty of distributing 
8,434.9 grams of marijuana four years ago. 
  Yahya, 37 years old and who had worked for the FELDA office 
in Lok Heng Timur in the State of Johor, was sentenced to death 
under Section 39B of the Dangerous Substances Act of 1952, as 
amended in 1983. 
  He was arrested by police in possession of the marijuana, 
which was discovered in a car in Kampung Tok Kamis, District of 
Pasir Puteh [State of Kelantan], 40 kilometers from Kota Bharu 
at about 1150 on 25 December 1989. 
  During the hearing of the case Yahya was represented by 
Attorney Lua Kok Hiyong, and the prosecution was conducted by 
Amiruddin Abdul Rahman, deputy public prosecutor (DPP). 
  When Ariffin Zakaria, the judge in the case, announced his 
decision on the matter, he said: "The accused is found guilty as 
charged and as proved, and the punishment for you is death." 
  Ariffin also ordered that the marijuana involved in this 
case 
should be destroyed. 
  When the sentence was handed down, Za'bah Hussein, Yahya's 
33-year-old wife who was in the court at the time, screamed 
continuously. When Yahya was led away from the bench of the 
accused, Za'bah rushed forward and threw her arms around her 
husband's neck, while continuing to sob. However, Yahya, the 
father of three children, appeared calm. He only looked downcast 
after he was led out of the courtroom when he saw one of his 
children sitting on a bench outside.

  [Text] Yesterday Director Epimaco Velasco, of the National 
Bureau of Investigation (NBI), stated that a test case for the 
death penalty will be the case which they will bring against two 
notorious drug traffickers believed to be the source of 200 
million pesos worth of shabu confiscated by the Philippine Navy 
from a fishing boat sometime ago. 
  In this connection, also yesterday, the owner of F/B Pamela 
Blizette, a fishing boat from which was confiscated 8.5 kilos of 
shabu, surrendered to the NBI. 
  Torcuato Cunanan, 60, a broker residing at 758 Bagong 
Silang, 
San Nicolas, Binondo, Manila, personally went to the Narcotics 
Division of the NBI after he learned that the NBI was looking 
for him in connection with the above-mentioned case. 
  Most likely, Cunanan denied any knowledge of the seizure of 
the shabu and emphasized that he was no longer the owner of the 
fishing vessel, since he sold it in June 1992. 
  Cunanan pointed to a certain Alfredo Tiongco, who supposedly 
bought the said fishing boat. However, the NBI will continue to 
investigate him, since the 10 bags of shabu which were in the 
fishing boat were consigned to him. 
  With regard to his statement that he sold the boat to 
Tiongco 
in 1992, the NBI has learned that in the last registration of 
the fishing boat, he (Cunanan) is still listed as the owner. 
  He (Cunanan) also stated that Tiongco was a former customer 
of his brokerage firm. 
  From the record check of the NBI, it was learned that a 
standing arrest warrant has been issued for Cunanan and Tiongco 
for violating customs laws, that is, for smuggling. The warrant 
was issued in 1988. 
  According to Director Velasco, the case against these two 
men 
is a possible test case for the death penalty.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] At the Police Department at 
1400 on 9 December, Police Lieutenant General Kowit Phakdiphum, 
the commissioner of the Narcotics Control Bureau [NCB], said 
that there have been reports that Hong Kong police officials 
arrested suspected narcotics traffickers on 8 December. Among 
those arrested was a Thai, Major General Thanat Phakpadiphat, 
who is assigned to Supreme Command. [passage omitted] 
  When asked if Maj. Gen. Thanat's name is on the list of 
suspected narcotics traffickers, Lt. Gen. Kowit said that his 
name is not on the list. Because this was an American arrest 
warrant, Hong Kong police officials will have to extradite the 
suspect to the United States. The United States will state its 
reasons and show us what evidence it has later on. As for the 
details about this case, all that he knows is that prior to 
this, American police officials arrested two Thais on 6 December. 
  A report stated that Maj. Gen. Thanat was arrested at 1200 
hours on 8 December along with a first lieutenant who serves as 
his aide. But after being questioned, the first lieutenant was 
released because he was not involved. Before the arrest of Maj. 
Gen. Thanat, U.S. DEA officials arrested Mr. Michael Woo, a Thai 
Chinese, and Miss Saowani, surname unknown, and seized 30 kg of 
heroin. During the interrogation, Mr. Woo implicated Maj. Gen. 
Thanat, who was later arrested. 
  When Maj. Gen. Thanat went to pick up his share of the 
money, 
$20,000, he was arrested. A news source said that besides Maj. 
Gen. Thanat, the United States has also issued a warrant for the 
arrest of Mr. Lee Chin Hung, a Yunnanese Chinese who works for 
Khun Sa. American officials asked the Thai Police Department to 
find and arrest this suspect, because it had been learned that 
he was hiding in Thailand. At 1300 hours on 9 December, NCB 
officials arrested Mr. Lee at the Chanphen Restaurant on Rama 4 
Road, Bangkok. He will be extradited to the United States for 
further handling of the case. 
  General Wimon Wongwanit, the Army commander-in-chief, talked 
about the arrest of Maj. Gen. Thanat, a CRMA Class 9 officer 
assigned to Supreme Command who was arrested in Hong Kong on 
charges of being involved in narcotics-trafficking activities. 
He said that he has been informed that the person arrested 
really was a soldier, but just because he is a major general 
doesn't necessarily mean that he serves in the Army. But 
regardless of which unit he is in, if he violated the law, he 
must be dealt with in accord with the law. He said that 
officials acted correctly in arresting him. Those in the 
military must know that if they break the law, the military will 
not protect them. 
  Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, the director of 
the 
Information Office, Supreme Command, said that he has received a 
report on the arrest of Maj. Gen. Thanat and that he has 
reported this to General Prasoet Sanrut, the deputy supreme 
commander. He does not yet know the details, but the Thai 
consulate in Hong Kong has been asked to investigate the matter. 
If he did commit a crime, he must be dealt with in accord with 
the law. 
  Lieutenant General Chettha Thanacharo, the 1st Army Region 
commander, said that those who violate the law must bear the 
consequences. The only thing is that we must wait for the 
verdict. He said that he just learned of this. According to 
military regulations, the matter must be handled in accord with 
the law. Discipline must be enforced very strictly, because he 
is a soldier. "According to military regulations, if a soldier 
breaks the law, he must be dealt with very harshly. His crime 
cannot be covered up. He must be punished severely. We must see 
what his intention was. Maj. Gen. Thanat is a good person. It's 
hard to believe that he was involved in something like that."

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The AFP news service issued a 
report from Hong Kong on 10 December stating that Major General 
Thanat Phakpadiphat, a 55-year-old officer assigned to Supreme 
Command, appeared at the Hong Kong court last Thursday while 
awaiting extradition to the United States on charges of having 
smuggled $4 million worth of narcotics. He will have to wait 
until 4 February 1994, because it will take American officials 
that long to prepare the extradition documents. For the time 
being, Maj. Gen. Thanat will remain in the custody of the Hong 
Kong court. 
  Maj. Gen. Thanat was arrested at the Hong Kong airport last 
Wednesday. U.S. DEA officials, with the cooperation of U.S. 
consular officials in Hong Kong, informed Hong Kong police that 
he was going to travel to Hong Kong in order to pick up $20,000, 
his share of the money. 
  As for Maj. Gen. Thanat's background, he was promoted to 
major general in 1993. He spent his career working for Supreme 
Command before being appointed assistant director of the 
Directorate of Joint Communications, Supreme Command. He 
attended the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy [CRMA] as a 
member of Class 9. Other members of this class include General 
Mongkhon Amphonphisit, the deputy chief of staff officers, 
Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, the director of the 
Information Office, Supreme Command, and Lieutenant General 
Chettha Thanacharo, the 1st Army Region commander. 
  He was once dismissed from government service for being 
involved in the April Hawai rebellion in 1981. That was during 
the period when he served as an aide to General San Chitpatima, 
the head of the Revolutionary Council. But later on, he was 
reinstated in the military. [passage omitted] 
  On the morning of 10 December at the Sirikit National 
Conference Center, Mr. Chuan Likphai, the prime minister, said 
that the case involving Maj. Gen. Thanat must be handled based 
on the facts and in accord with the law. A reporter asked if 
officials will request that Maj. Gen. Thanat be returned to 
Thailand so that the case can be handled here. The prime 
minister said that the facts must be reviewed first. 
  Mr. Chamni Sakdiset, the deputy minister of interior, said 
that heroin trafficking is an individual offense. Even if the 
person is a soldier, that has nothing to do with the military. 
If he is guilty, action must be taken against him. We must allow 
those who arrested him to handle the case. We could handle the 
case, but the country that prosecutes this case must give its 
reasons and state what evidence it has. 
  Mr. Samak Sunthorawet, the leader of the Thai Citizen Party, 
said that narcotics trafficking is a very serious charge. Thus, 
those concerned should explain things. They may claim that this 
is a personal matter, but this will undoubtedly affect the 
institution to some extent. He said that the military will 
probably conclude this matter very quickly. And if no other unit 
is implicated, this won't affect anything. We must wait until 
the accused makes his statement. 
  Mr. Surin Phitsuwan, the deputy minister of foreign affairs, 
said that he just read about the arrest of a general on 
narcotics trafficking charges. The government has clearly stated 
its policy on this. The government has a clear policy on 
suppressing narcotics and will resolutely support international 
narcotics suppression organizations. The U.S. DEA has frequently 
requested the cooperation of the Thai Government. He was asked, 
In view of the fact that a high-ranking officer has been 
implicated, what can the Thai Government do to put a good face 
on this? The deputy foreign minister said that we must question 
his superiors. But this was the act of an individual. You can't 
blame the military. There are evil people in all organizations. 
If he is guilty, he must be punished in accord with the law. 
  Police General Praman Adireksan, the leader of the 
opposition, said that as a former soldier, when he learned that 
a Thai general had been arrested on narcotics trafficking 
charges, he felt very distressed, because this will tarnish the 
Army's image.

  [Excerpts] Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri, the minister of 
foreign affairs, said that he had received a report from the 
Thai consul general in Hong Kong regarding the arrest of an army 
officer on narcotics charges. He has ordered the Thai consulate 
to coordinate things, help find a lawyer, and provide other help. 
  Hong Kong police officials and U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement 
Administration] officials arrested Major General Thanat 
Phakpadiphat, who is assigned to the Supreme Command, in Hong 
Kong on charges of trafficking in heroin. 
  The minister of foreign affairs, who was interviewed by 
reporters before leaving on a trip to Cambodia on 11 December, 
said that he has not been contacted by Major General Thanat. If 
it is found that he actually was involved in illegal activities, 
resolute action must be taken in accord with the law. As for 
whether he will be extradited to the United States for trial, 
that depends on the extradition treaty between the United States 
and Hong Kong. [passage omitted] 
  In an interview, General Wichit Sukmak, the minister of 
defense, said that Major General Thanat's arrest by DEA 
officials in Hong Kong is a personal matter and will not affect 
the Army's image.

narcotics-trafficking charges. He said that this is a personal 
matter and that he doesn't know much about this. If he knew 
anything about this, he would be smarter than American 
officials. Those who do something wrong must be dealt with in 
accord with the law. That's it. As for issuing statements about 
this, that is the duty of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The 
military probably won't get involved. 
  The reporter asked, If someone in the military is involved 
in 
narcotics trafficking, will that affect the military? Lt. Gen. 
Chettha said that it shouldn't. The military is a huge 
organization. If only five out of a hundred people are bad, 
that's pretty good. But there are more than 100,000 people in 
the military. This shouldn't have any adverse effect on the 
military. We have constantly carried on narcotics suppression 
activities. Even abroad, even if the president or prime minister 
is involved in such activities, action must be taken in accord 
with the law. If there is clear evidence that a high-ranking 
official is involved, he must be punished in accord with the 
law. But if he is innocent, the military has disciplinary 
measures to provide help. 
  General Charan Kunlawanit, the secretary general of the 
National Security Council (NSC), said that foreigners have 
frequently charged that Thais are involved in 
narcotics-trafficking activities. But he would like to ask 
foreigners, "Instead of focusing on the traffickers, why don't 
you stop buying drugs? If foreigners focus on just the one 
aspect, they will never solve this problem." The reporter said 
that there have been reports that both civilian and military 
officials are involved in narcotics trafficking. Gen. Charan 
said that he doesn't know anything about that. But he said that 
this does not concern the security of the nation. Rather, this 
is a matter of someone breaking the law. The units concerned 
must conduct an investigation. He does not, however, always 
believe what foreigners say, because foreigners like to meddle 
in Thailand's affairs. Thailand has done good things, but 
foreigners have never praised us. Thus, things must be done very 
carefully. [passage omitted] 
  General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the minister of interior and 
minister of labor, was interviewed by a reporter at Wat Phra 
Simahathat about the reports that other senior government 
officials are involved in narcotics trafficking. He said that 
the person's position has nothing to do with it. Anyone who 
violates the law must be punished. As for coordinating things 
with American officials in arresting high-ranking military 
officers said to be involved in narcotics trafficking, police 
officials are monitoring and investigating things. There are 
data, but before any action can be taken, there must be 
compelling evidence. An investigation must be conducted first. 
We can't base our actions on what they say. He said that 
everything will turn out fine. We have to do things in our own 
way. There is no reason for concern, because we know what is 
what. We know what is going on. Thailand has constantly helped 
the United States on narcotics matters. It's not true that we 
won't help. We have given more help than people realize.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Police Lieutenant General Kowit 
Phakdiphum, the commissioner of the Narcotics Control Bureau, 
talked about the arrest of Major General Thanat by DEA [Drug 
Enforcement Administration] officials. He said that the DEA 
informed him of the impending arrest just two or three days 
before the arrest. The first arrests were made in Eugene, 
Oregon. Then, Maj. Gen. Thanat was arrested in Hong Kong. The 
two arrests were connected to each other. American officials 
have confirmed that they have evidence. DEA officials asked for 
our cooperation in arresting a Chinese Burmese named Mr. Lee. 
Thai police officials arrested him on 9 December and extradited 
him on 11 December. Most recently, DEA officials arrested the 
sixth member of this gang in Oregon. None of those arrested 
there were Thais. 
  The reporter asked if the DEA had identified any Thais as 
being involved with this narcotics trafficking gang. Police Lt. 
Gen. Kowit said that no such information has been provided. He 
said that he had met with the head of the DEA in Thailand 
earlier in the day and that they had talked about the Associated 
Press report that a Thai police official was involved in this. 
But the DEA official told him that they have no evidence to that 
effect, unless the suspects implicate others. 
  The reporter asked if this arrest will tarnish Thailand's 
image. Police Lt. Gen. Kowit said that this will have a good 
effect, because it will show the world that Thailand is 
cooperating and that we are sincere about wanting to suppress 
narcotics. The United States has praised Thailand for this. 
  The reporter asked is the DEA had confirmed that no Thai 
police officials or soldiers were involved. Police Lt. Gen. 
Kowit said that none were involved. But that may not be so in 
other cases, because nothing has happened yet. As far as this 
case is concerned, Maj. Gen. Thanat has personal ties to Thais 
living in Oregon. It's unlikely that others were involved. He 
confirmed that there is strong evidence against Maj. Gen. 
Thanat. He was not arrested as a scapegoat as some fear. 
  As the person responsible for overseeing the work of the 
Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), Mr. Amnuai 
Wirawan, the deputy prime minister, said that the ONCB is doing 
a good job. The arrest of a Thai general abroad has nothing to 
do with the ONCB. 
  Mr. Amnuai said that with respect to statements by U.S. 
officials that senior Thai military officers, police officials, 
and civil servants are involved in narcotics trafficking 
activities, the ONCB has frequently contacted international 
organizations concerning suppression activities. It must be 
admitted that there are some senior Thai officials who are 
involved. But there are only a few such people. There are a few 
bad people in every large organization. Steps must be taken to 
get rid of the "rotten fish." "I don't think that this news will 
tarnish the image of Thai officials, because there are many good 
people in the Thai bureaucracy. The Thai Government has 
constantly helped other countries suppress narcotics. If 
Thailand had not made those arrests, the damage would have been 
much greater. The military has never tried to pull strings to 
help one of its men." 
  The reporter asked if the ONCB will coordinate things with 
the United States and ask for the names of those senior [Thai] 
officials said to be involved in narcotics trafficking 
activities so that action can be taken against them. Mr. Amnuai 
said that we have always cooperated with them. Thailand has 
compiled a list of names, too, and some of the names appear on 
both lists. Some of the names do not appear in the directory of 
Thai officials but appear abroad. There is nothing unusual about 
this. 
  Police General Prathin Santipraphop, the acting director 
general of the Police Department, discussed the statement made 
by General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, minister of interior, who said 
that information provided by the DEA indicates that police 
officers are involved in narcotics trafficking activities. 
Police Gen. Prathin said that the Ministry of Interior has not 
issued any instructions. If information is provided, the matter 
must be investigated. The United States has not said who is on 
the list. The only names that have been released are the names 
of those who were arrested. 
  Lieutenant General Anuphap Songsunthon, the 2d Army Region 
commander, said that the news that a major general has been 
charged with trafficking in heroin is very disturbing. The Army 
is a very large organization and so there are both good people 
and bad people in it. But high-ranking officials should not be 
involved in such things. Being involved in narcotics-trafficking 
activities is a very serious matter. But what happened is a 
personal matter. This has nothing to do with the military. 
  Second Lieutenant Phairot Suwannachawi, a National 
Development Party member of Parliament from Nakhon Ratchasima 
Province and an activist in Group 16, said that the units 
concerned, that is, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ONCB, 
and the Police Department, must provide clear and detailed 
information to show if there are real grounds for charging a 
general with being involved in heroin trafficking. Otherwise, 
when senior Thai officials travel abroad, they may not be 
treated with respect. He said that he once traveled abroad 
together with a provincial governor and they were both stripped 
and searched. This is a terrible matter. But this is a personal 
matter that does not involve the military. He said that he hopes 
that politicians and the mass media will think carefully before 
saying anything or criticizing something.

  [Text] The abbot of Wat Tham Krabok in Saraburi yesterday 
said he had closed his drug rehabilitation centre to new Hmong 
arrivals, as the Interior Ministry announced it was considering 
a plan to wipe out the remaining anti-Vientiane movement 
allegedly operating from the temple. 
  Phra Chamrun Panchan said he regretted the decision not to 
admit more Hmong drug addicts for treatment. 
  "It's a pity we have to close our rehabilitation centre to 
the Hmong hilltribe people at a time when more and more of them 
have realized the need to kick the habit," said the abbot, a 
recipient of the prestigious Magsaysay award for public service. 
  He said he had recently turned away a group of 105 Hmong 
from 
Nan province who wanted his help to get over their drug 
addiction. 
  Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut, who did not 
provide details of the plan to put an end to anti-Vientiane 
activity based in Thailand, yesterday said some of the Hmong at 
the drug treatment centre are connected with right-wing 
anti-Vientiane rebel leader Vang Pao. 
  Deputy Interior Ministry Permanent Secretary Chaloem 
Phromloet said that 6,052 of the 10,000 Hmong at the temple are 
illegal immigrants from Laos, not from northern Thailand as are 
the others who are known as Thai Pukhao. 
  According to the ministry's figures, there are less than 200 
drug addicts at Wat Tham Krabok. 
  The National Security Council last year asked the Interior 
Ministry to screen residents of the temple to separate the drug 
addicts from the alleged Hmong rebels in disguise. The ministry 
was also asked to take necessary action against those using the 
temple for reasons other than drug rehabilitation. 
  Phra Chamrun said provincial authorities had deployed 
militiamen around his temple for several weeks after a report 
last year that the sprawling compound had been used by rightwing 
Hmong opposed to the Lao government as a staging area for 
sabotage and acts of terrorism inside Laos. 
  "But the militiamen have since been recalled because they 
did 
not find any illegal activities committed by the Hmong people," 
he said. 
  He said he wanted the provincial authorities to send in 
observers to monitor the work of his staff at the drug 
rehabilitation centre to make sure no illegal activities took 
place. 
  The abbot complained that the authorities tended to regard 
him and his staff with suspicion. 
  Phra Chamrun said although the number of Hmong hilltribe 
people undergoing treatment was small, the majority of the close 
to 10,000 Hmong at the temple were their family members and 
relatives. 
  The abbot denied that any of the Hmong residing at his 
temple 
had anything to do with Gen Vang Pao, the leader of a Hmong 
armed force opposed to Vientiane.

  [Text] This week's TIEN PHONG (VANGUARD) Magazine carries 
Quang Binh's article about a case of drug trafficking involving 
more than 230 kg of opium, the biggest drug trafficking case 
discovered so far. The case was discovered by officers of the 
Intersectional Force at the No. 45 Check Point of the Sixth 
National Highways in Son La Province on 25 January. 
  The opium was carried in six gunny sacks and transported in 
a 
car belonging to the Dien Bien Education Department of Lai Chau 
Province with registration number 27A-2278. The car was driven 
by Mr. Nguyen Minh Chau to take Mr. Nguyen Xuan Ngan, acting 
director of the Lai Chau Department of Education and Training, 
and other education cadres to Hanoi for a meeting. 
  According to initial statements made by the suspects, the 
owner of the drug is Mr. Nguyen Dang Quang, age 36 of Gia Luong 
District of Ha Bac Province. He was given a ride to Hanoi. 
  The incident was investigated by law enforcement agencies to 
clarify the involvement of each suspect for a correct trial 
under the law.

  [Text] According to sources from the antismuggling 
department under the Customs General Department, customs 
officers at the Ho Chi Minh City postal service have uncovered a 
case of drug trafficking through the postal service as follows: 
  While checking a parcel destined for the United States, 
Customs Inspector Le Dinh Khang discovered that the liner of a 
blanket contained a layer of morphine. The liner itself was fit 
into a quilt. The overall weight of the blanket was 5.95 
kilograms and the layer of morphine alone weighed about 3 
kilograms. The name of the sender was Tran Thi Quang Kim, a 
resident of Thong Nhat District in Dong Nai Province, and the 
name of the receiver was Ly Quang Minh, an overseas Vietnamese 
in the United States. It was also known that Nong Thi Kim Dung, 
a resident of Ba Ria-Vung Tau, brought the parcel to the post 
office. 
  Both the proof of the crime and the persons involved have 
already been handed over to the Ho Chi Minh public security 
service for further investigation.

<F P=106> [Article: "Antidrug Education in Schools--Drug Addiction, </F>
Production, and Trade Today"] 
  [Excerpts] According to World Health Organization data, the 
world as a whole has 50 million drug addicts using 3,303 tons of 
opium annually. Southeast Asia has about 5 million addicts using 
1,889 tons of opium. Our country today has about 500,000 
addicts using 25 tons of opium annually. In 11 northern 
highland provinces alone, opium addicts number 130,000. A survey 
of the ages of addicts conducted by the detoxification center of 
Cao Bang Province shows that of 14,813 addicts, those in the 
9-16 age group account for 13 percent; the 17-30 age group, 47 
percent; 31-45, 26 percent; and 46-80, 14 percent. 
  The majority of drug addicts in our country smoke opium. In 
Quang Nam-Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City, there are some heroin 
addicts. Drug addiction prevails in the male population, with 
females accounting for only 1.92-8.33 percent. Most drug addicts 
have level I and level II educational backgrounds, with those in 
the well-to-do and rich group accounting for 47-80 percent and 
poor people 20-30 percent of all cases. 
  At present, narcotics are produced on an ever-increasing 
scale. Except for a small quantity of them being legally 
produced, their trade is illegal. In the world today, many 
regions, such as a number of Latin American countries and 
Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia, or Southeast Asia such as the 
border area between Thailand, Laos, and Burma, are considered 
major drug centers. Some countries like Turkey and Iran openly 
grow poppy. In Vietnam, according to reports, from October to 
December 1992, in 9 northern provinces (Lao Cai, Ha Giang, Son 
La, Lai Chau, Yen Bai, Cao Bang, Nghe An, Thanh Hoa, and Hoa 
Binh) 41 districts raised poppy in a total area of 12,925 
hectares. [passage omitted] 
  In Vietnam, opium smoking, intravenous use of drugs, and 
smuggling of narcotics are increasing. This is a source of 
concern and worries for society as a whole. On 29 January 1993, 
the government issued Resolution 06/CP "On Strengthening 
Leadership Over Prevention and Control of Narcotics." This 
resolution clearly asserts that "It is necessary to firmly fight 
this ill by taking various propaganda, campaigning, educational, 
economic, administrative-handling, and criminal-law measures."

<F P=106> [Article by Dang Van Ky: "Fighting Opium Smoking in Nghe </F>
An--Efforts Failing To Discourage Desire To Smoke"] 
  [Excerpts] Each year Nghe An produces 14 tons of 
opium, excluding several tons coming into the province from 
Laos. Where does it go? Tens of thousands of people, emaciated 
and sick, are suffering from and going broke because of opium. 
Hundreds of billions of dong are being poured into a bottomless 
pocket. Questions remain unanswered.... 
  Dreadful Figures 
  [Passage omitted] According to statistics, Ky Son District, 
a 
district that shares 192 kilometers of border with Laos, has 
3,000 opium addicts; Tuong Duong District, 1,400; Que Phong 
District, 1,800; Quy Chau District, 174; Quynh Giang Village (in 
Quynh Luu District), a village that is located on National Route 
1A, 57. The City of Vinh and other districts all have some 
addicts, but are not included in the statistics, which show a 
total of over 6,000 drug addicts in Nghe An. 
  If we look more closely, we will find that the poorer and 
more backward the rural areas are, the larger the numbers of 
addicts they have. This is true in terms of ethnic groups. Of 
the total of over 5,000 addicts in the Nghe An highland 
districts, the Hmong people account for 37 percent; the Hdu, 37 
percent; the Thai, 24 percent, but the Vietnamese, only 2 
percent. A more harmful fact is this: The addicts in the 15-45 
age group account for 78 percent, with many children among the 
addicts being breadwinners that their families depend on. What 
will become of their race? 
  Let us give you other statistics: There currently are in the 
highlands of Nghe An 3,250 hectares of land used for poppy 
cultivation, with annual opium output reaching 14,000 kilograms. 
In addition, 1,000 kilograms are brought in from Laos through 
the smuggling route. These amounts are enough not only to 
supply the 6,000 Nghe An addicts with opium, but also to 
"support" tens of thousands of people being "in the same boat" 
from Hanoi to Saigon. 
  Not Very Successful Fights 
  The people of Nghe An did not wait until today to fight 
back. 
If we go back nearly half a century, after August 1945, Nghe An 
had at least four memorable timeframes. The first phase in the 
years of 1945-1946 saw a campaign aimed at attacking social 
ills, including opium addiction. People smashed opium smoking 
paraphernalia, threw opium into streams, and happily announced 
to fellow villagers that they had quit smoking opium. In some 
villages close to 100 addicts succeeded in giving up smoking. 
Stopping the habit 100 percent. Some until now. 
  More than 10 years after the delta had enthusiastically 
carried out the land reforms, the highlands was crazy 
about democratic reforms. All social ills were blamed 
on "enemy plots." People who were caught in these ills were 
considered "caught by the enemy's tricks." As a result, lots of 
people secretly threw both their smoking paraphernalia and opium 
into caves. The fact that people were told to obey orders was by 
itself a force. 
  About five years later people realized that opium addiction 
had not decreased but actually was rising. Some localities lost 
their hope, sighed, and let things happen according to their 
fate. Other localities, the most outstanding one being Ky Son 
District, did exactly the opposite: They firmly fought back. The 
leadership at the district level made a decision to order 
forced concentration. They issued summons to call 
addicts to appear at a specified location. Fences had been 
erected. Guards were stationed everywhere. Did addicts froth at 
the mouth as a symptom of withdrawal? They were free to do so. 
Did they scratch, curse, and break things? They were free to 
do so. Did they defecate and urinate? They were free to do so. 
Did any chronic ailments recur because of a lack of opium? Too 
bad if they happened to them that way. The concentration camps 
became a battlefield, a dumpsite, an unbelievable place.... 
People called them the quitting method. 
  In the past, the Tran dynasty fought the Chinese and 
Mongolian invaders three times before being able to persuade 
them that they should not dare to come to this "land in the 
south" anymore. Nghe An fought the "opium invader" twice, but 
it remained unbeaten. That was really a kind of terrible weed. 
Therefore, as we entered the 1990's, 30 years after that 
dreadful "quitting method," once again the detoxification 
campaign had to be revived. This campaign has been going on 
since the beginning of 1992. 
  In the face of the AIDS danger, mankind as a whole has 
unanimously spoken against the intravenous use of drugs. Vietnam 
is a part of this global campaign. And Nghe An is a part of 
this national part. This means that compared to the three 
previous antidrug campaigns, obviously the campaign this time is 
different in both nature and scope. 
  Addicts generally consist of: First, well-to-do people who 
have nothing to do but to seek pleasure, like the group of "da 
do" (red stone) people in Quynh Chau, or the new rich. Second, 
adolescents who curiously try something new by smoking just for 
fun and then get hooked. However, the third kind of addicts is 
the most numerous and pitiable: They are victims of poverty and 
backwardness. Addiction happens to these people in two ways. 
The first comes from the belief that opium has a tonic quality 
that gives them strength. To chop down trees and to clear bushes 
to make terraced fields is not an easy job, and this does not 
count the distance to be traveled that requires climbing hills 
and crossing streams. To compensate for this expending of 
energy, an appropriate intake of protein is needed. But these 
people usually do not have much to eat, just a few bowls of 
rice, even just a few pieces of manioc or wild roots. Then they 
come to the opium-smoking paraphernalia. And as a magic wand, a 
few puffs banish the fatigue in their body. They do not know 
that the opium provides them with stimulation that creates a 
false strength, a strength that saps their own body. The second 
way: Because of poverty and backwardness, they contract 
diseases. They do not get treatment by doctors, except for folk 
healers. They do not have medicines, but they have opium. Do 
they have to give it up? No, they just take a tiny piece of 
opium, put it into their mouth, and swallow it. Diseases are 
cured right away. When they are sick again, they will get 
another tiny piece of opium and swallow it. They do not even 
know when they have been hooked. This explains why we have 
"all-family" addiction and addiction of fetuses, just like the 
case of Hua Bac Village (in Ky Son District) where all 
residents, old and young, 100 percent of its population, are 
addicts. 
  In the detoxification campaign this time, the province has 
the participation of its Ethnic Minorities Committee and Labor, 
War Invalids, and Social Welfare Service. As to districts, they 
usually send in a district deputy chairman. Villages send in 
their chairmen. Currently, Nghe An has five detoxification 
centers. Four are located in districts--Ky Son, Tuong Duong, Que 
Phong, and Quy Chau--and one in a village, Quynh Giang (which 
once held the leading banner in the nationwide public health 
field, with the center director, Tran Chu, earning the title of 
the field's hero). 
  Although there are organs and individuals responsible for 
the 
campaign, the method that is used to carry out this totally 
scientific task has been labeled "up to your convenience and 
creativity." This is thus the greatest weakness of this current 
detoxification campaign. Because the centers are allowed to use 
their own "creativity," each center uses its own method and has 
its own prescription. Let us take the largest detoxification 
center, Ky Son District, as an example. Ky Son had a medical 
aid station of the border defense forces in Subregion 50. It 
consisted of one physician, two doctor's assistants, seven 
nurses, and one orderly. By the middle of 1993 (after more than 
a year), it had completed detoxification in 118 cases. It 
achieved a high rate of success, much higher than that of other 
detoxification centers. 
  "Please tell me the reasons for your success," I once asked 
district Deputy Chairman Mua No Tu, the head of the 
detoxification committee. 
  "There were many reasons," Mua No Tu answered me, smiling. 
"First of all, the addicts wanted to be rid of the habit. They 
were broke. Their houses leaked. They had no rice. Their 
clothes were all rags. They were emaciated and sick. Both 
wives and husbands showed displeasure toward each other on their 
face. If they did not undergo detoxifying treatment, they would 
die. You see, my dear journalist, we enjoy lots of affection. 
In some villages, as we announced the detoxification program 
available for 10 addicts, 30 and 40 people showed up, which made 
us send several of them home." 
  The Subregion 50 physicians really had been working hard in 
this totally humanitarian task. They had to travel all the way 
to Hanoi to learn from other physicians and to find medications. 
The Hanoi physicians, out of respect for their colleagues, 
taught them the method of treatment and sold them 10 doses of 
medications at the total price of 3 million dong. Back at the 
center, they used three doses on three patients. The first day, 
everything was fine. The second day, everything was fine. The 
third day, oh God, the patients either got mad or fainted. 
Everybody was scared stiff. Orders were given to stop the 
medication in order to look for another prescription. But which 
one? The Ky Son District CPV [Communist Party of Vietnam] 
Committee secretary, Cao Tien Tan, had a traditional 
prescription handed down from his ancestors which he believed 
was good. But unfortunately he was in the position of a 
district party secretary. What if something happened? 
  "In Vientiane there is a brilliant healer," somebody 
suggested. 
  The center wrote a letter to invite him over. Having learned 
from the experience with the Hanoi prescription, the prospective 
employer wrote: 
  "We invite you to come and stay to treat our patients. We 
will provide you with meals and drinks. After the treatment, if 
it brings about good results, we will pay you the full amount of 
3 million dong for the 10 doses of medications. We will 
reimburse you for travel expenses, too." 
  The Vientiane doctor replied that he was very busy and that 
he would only sell the medications and could not stay at all. 
Why? It was obvious that he was not sure about the results of 
the treatment. Finally, the center had to lose 1.6 million dong 
as "supplemental allowance" paid to him. 
  Ky Son also sent people to Vinh to buy other medications. 
And 
finally it had to use the district party secretary's 
prescription, now called TK92. It was TK92 that helped to cure 
113 of the 118 cases, with only five patients becoming addicted 
again because of a recurrence of their chronic diseases. What 
did they use to treat these diseases? Once again, opium. And 
so they became addicted once more. Presently, patients in Van 
Chan District (in Yen Bai Province) and in Thai Binh Province 
have used TK92, with good results (but TK92 used for addicts in 
Quy Chau District has not brought about any good results, 
probably because of a failure to follow exactly the physician's 
prescribed instructions). 
  The method that Quynh Giang Village used to detoxify addicts 
was totally different from that used by Ky Son. Whether because 
the 57 addicts there had violated the honor of a locality that 
had been given the national public health leading banner, or 
because of any other reasons, that Quynh Giang adopted the 
"dictatorial" measure to bear upon its addicts, we did not know. 
Prior to organizing the detoxification program, the village had 
built four high walls. It also put up a barbed-wire fence. In 
addition to the medical staff, the village cadres also stationed 
four public security men there. Then orders were issued for 
holding a meeting. Then people were sent out to escort the 
addicts in. It was as noisy as an operation launched to catch a 
bunch of bandits. In the first phase, there were 11 
detoxification patients. After two months, a review found that 
five of them became addicted again. In the second phase, 12 
patients were to receive treatment, but three of them escaped 
because of excessive fear. The nine addicts who were caught and 
taken to the center all went on "medication hunger strike" and 
promised that they would quit the habit by themselves. 
  The results obtained in other centers were no better than 
those in Quynh Giang. Que Phong took in 22 addicts for 
detoxification, but four of them escaped from the center, 
leaving 18 behind. After two months, a review found that 14 
became addicted again. In Quy Chau, after two months, 18 of 24 
patients smoked again. In Tuong Duong, after two months, 18 of 
27 patients smoked again. And so, excluding the Ky Son 
detoxification center, only 24 cases were treated sucessfully in 
the other four centers. 
  And yet, in this phase 1, the state had spent 170 million 
dong. 
  It was because of the successes and failures in phase 1 that 
the campaign leaders have changed the way to manage it. Since 
the middle of 1993 the Nghe An Public Health Service has been in 
charge of the detoxification program in the province. Perhaps 
this is the right approach. Medically speaking, drug addiction 
is a disease. Since it is a disease, treatment must come from 
physicians. 
  Question Marks Remaining 
  After more than a year of detoxification in Nghe An we must 
reluctantly ask these questions: Can Nghe An save the more than 
6,000 people, the pitiable and reproachable people, from the 
vicious cycle of addiction? When is this mission of salvation 
over? It is difficult for anybody to offer an answer. However, 
this is not the only pain. We do not know whether some 
adolescents, malaria patients, and people afflicted by stomach 
diseases, stomach aches, and so on are getting close to opium 
and befriending it at the same time when statisticians are 
adding and subtracting figures or not. We do not know whether 
during the two years in which Nghe An succeeded in saving those 
150 people from opium addiction the same number of people might 
have been "caught in the trap" of opium. 
  The most important issue, which most absolutely requires 
action, is to destroy the source of materials. It is just that 
simple. It is complicated, too. If we try to know everything, we 
will find that very many Hmong villages live on growing poppy. A 
couple who grows poppy harvests from 1.5 to 2.5 kilograms of 
opium in each production season. The price of a kilogram of 
opium at its source is 1 million dong. According to its plan, 
Nghe An Province will spend 2.3 billion dong to help ethnic 
groups to buy cows, pigs, seedlings, and so on in order to 
switch from growing poppy to growing other crops. Is it all 
right that way? To be more exact, is it completely all right 
that way? What is the use of raising cows and pigs and finding 
nobody to buy them because the terrain consists only of 
mountains, chasms, and hilly land, where there are no means of 
communications at all? This means that we must build roads. If 
that sum of money--2.3 billion dong--from the Bank of Vietnam is 
also spent on building roads and bridges, it will be just a drop 
in the bucket! 
  There also is this question: Because the highlands of Nghe 
An had once produced 14 tons of opium a year and still had been 
getting tons of the same stuff from across the border, when this 
stuff becomes scarce, how much of it--2 tons, or 4 tons--will we 
expect to see sweep across the border now? 
  And so we still cannot stop worrying about the unexpected 
consequences of this black demon that is called opium! 
  Vinh, October 1993.

  [Text] Vienna, Feb. 19, IRNA -- The Tehran communique will 
be the pivot of the 30th session of the United Nations 
sub-committee on narcotic drugs to be held in Damascus 21 
February, Mojtaba Arastoo, Iran's ambassador to the Vienna-based 
international organizations announced here today. 
  He added that the Damascus session will discuss the latest 
developments regarding drug trafficking in the Middle and Near 
East as well as the ways to campaign [against] the cultivation 
of opium poppy. 
  Arastoo said that the Tehran communique consists of an 
introduction and six chapters, adding that the first chapter 
calls on all countries to join the 1961, 1971 and 1988 
conventions on narcotic drugs. 
  The first chapter also stresses the need for developing 
financial and regional strategies to fight drug trafficking, he 
added. 
  Destroying illegal poppy farms, creating substitute farming, 
confiscating the wealth accumulated as a result of drug 
trafficking and fighting drug abuse are among the issues 
incorporated into the other chapters of the communique, Arastoo 
said. 
  He also added that the communique envisages the 
establishment 
of an Islamic fund and seeks cooperation of international 
financial organizations for undertaking job-oriented projects 
and setting up of educational centers to enhance the awareness 
of people regarding drug abuse in the areas where poppy is 
cultivated. 
  The relentless campaign of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
against drug trafficking, on the one hand, and the economic 
conditions prevailing [in] the newly-independent republics of 
the former Soviet Union on the other, have given an impetus to 
drug trafficking via the routes of these republics to Europe, he 
said. 
  The agenda of the sub-committee has considerably expanded 
subject wise and from geographic point of view, he added. 
  Referring to the recent visit of the executive director of 
the UN international drug control program to Tehran, he said 
that in the near future a regional office of the said program 
would be established in Islamabad, and a trilateral memorandum 
of understanding would be signed among Iran, Pakistan and the 
U.N. 
  Arastoo left Vienna for Damascus Saturday to deliver a 
speech 
in the opening session of the sub-committee as the former 
chairman.

  [Excerpt] Under the auspices of Prime Minister Mahmud 
al-Zu'bi, the 30th session of the subcommittee in charge of 
illegal drug trafficking and related issues in the Near and 
Middle East was opened today. Interior Minister Dr. Muhammad 
Harbah deputized for the prime minister. The session opening 
was attended by a number of ministers; (Bernard Farahi), 
representative of the UN drug-control program; and (Kendall), 
secretary general of Interpol. The opening was also attended by 
assistant ministers, heads of desks and departments at the 
Interior Ministry, representatives of the popular organizations 
and trade unions, a number of Arab and foreign ambassadors in 
Damascus, and the heads and members of the delegations 
participating in the session. 
  Dr. Harbah delivered a speech in which he welcomed the 
participants in this session, noting the importance of its 
convening in Damascus. He added that this shows Syria's 
interest in the issue of narcotics. 
  The interior minister referred to the drug combating law 
issued last year. He said this law has two characteristics: 
  First: The law views drug addicts as individuals who must be 
treated. He added that the country has established specialized 
sanatoriums for the treatment of addicts and has avoided legal 
pursuit of addicts if they approached a sanatorium for 
treatment. He added that an establishment has been set up to 
care for and rehabilitate addicts who had received treatment in 
sanatoriums so that they can adapt to the society and prevent 
their deviation. 
  Second: The law calls for applying tough measures, including 
the death penalty, against all those who commit crimes of 
trafficking, cultivating, or manufacturing drugs. 
  The interior minister added that in 1987 Syria formed a 
national committee for narcotics and psychotropic drugs. This 
committee is charged with laying down general policies and 
coordinating cooperation between the various drug combating 
quarters in the country and their Arab and international 
counterparts. He added that an independent directorate for 
drugs was established in Syria with the aim of activating and 
reinforcing preventive, combat, and treatment measures. 
  Minister Harbah added that Syria has participated in laying 
down and endorsing the Arab strategy for combating the illegal 
use of narcotics and psychotropic drugs, the phased steps 
stemming from this strategy, and in adopting an ideal unified 
Arab draft law on narcotics. 
  Dr. Harbah said: Syria concluded bilateral cooperation 
agreements in the drug combating field with Saudi Arabia, 
Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and Oman. It also signed the Arab 
agreement for drug combating adopted by the Arab Interior 
Ministers Council at the beginning of this year. It has been 
cooperating with the Arab Center for Security Studies and 
Training in holding narcotics seminars. 
  On the international level, Harbah stressed that Syria is a 
party to the international agreements on narcotics and a member 
of the subcommittee on illegal drug trafficking in the Near and 
Middle East. He added that Syria signed bilateral agreements 
with Turkey, Cyprus, and Iran for cooperation in combating 
drugs. He said that it also participates in regional seminars 
and meetings on combating drugs. The minister reiterated the 
importance of this seminar and presented many basic working 
points. Noting the importance of self immunity, he said: We, 
in Syria, work hard to implant in our youths religious, social, 
and cultural deterrents which are an important factor and 
impregnable shield which protect people from falling victim to 
narcotics. We also work toward tackling ignorance, family 
divisions, and illiteracy. The interior minister underscored 
the role of educational institutions as well as cultural, 
social, and sport clubs in looking after youths and protecting 
them. He also highlighted the role of popular organizations and 
trade unions which contributed to enlightening people. 
Consequently, he added, the narcotics problem remained very 
limited and was not a cause for concern. 
  The interior minister added: In order to continue the war on 
drugs, illegal cultivation of narcotic plants should be stopped, 
drug combating personnel should receive continuous training to 
enhance their performance, and the extradition of drug criminals 
must be included in agreements signed between countries.

  [Text] Damascus--The 30th session of the subcommittee in 
charge of illegal drug trafficking and related issues in the 
Near and Middle East was concluded at noon today. At the end of 
the session, conferees approved a number of reports on the 
future of illegal drug trafficking in the region. The reports 
outline possible preventive measures and call for vigilance by 
regional states over the emergence of new trafficking methods 
and techniques. They also call for the adoption of measures to 
reduce illegal production in the region, which should be 
followed by measures to reduce illegal demand for drugs in 
consuming countries; the promulgation of appropriate 
regulations, the adoption of other measures to effectively 
implement the provisions of the 1988 agreement; and the exchange 
of information on criminal organizations involved in illegal 
drug trafficking in the region. 
  The reports also stressed the need for collective efforts 
and 
vigilance, especially at border monitoring posts, in order to 
ensure greater effectiveness in organizing the traffic of 
sulfates, and for supporting the recommendations of the 
international conference on chemical operations. The reports 
urge governments to extend support for the database of the 
international commission for controlling narcotics, ensuring a 
swift exchange of information among competent authorities, and 
for issuing national legislation that prohibits the possession 
of some critical chemical substances. 
  On cooperation in the field of cross-border investigations, 
the reports stressed the need for close coordination to exchange 
information and enable the authorities to fully achieve their 
objective of spotting and arresting the traffickers. The 
reports noted the need for coordination among international 
organizations to prepare model training programs in the field of 
combating money laundering and for coordination with Arab and 
international centers to improve the performance of workers in 
the field of combating drugs in the Near and Middle East. The 
reports stress the need to promote cooperation among the World 
Health Organization, Interpol, the customs cooperation council, 
the international commission for monitoring drugs, the Arab 
center for security studies and training, and the Arab Interior 
Ministers' Council. They also stressed the need for cooperation 
with the world network for regional intelligence communications 
through the special bureau that is scheduled to be set up in the 
Middle East in April 1994, and for preparing programs that deal 
with the issue of treating and rehabilitating drug addicts.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Feb (MENA)--The Counternarcotics agencies 
at the Cairo Security Directorate have succeeded in the past 
four months in seizing 67 kg of hashish and four kg of heroin, 
estimated at 1.4 million pounds, 500 grams of opium, and four kg 
of various types of narcotic pills. Brigadier General 'Abdallah 
al-Watiri, head of the Counternarcotics Department at the Cairo 
Security Directorate, said today that the Counternarcotics 
Department succeeded in the past nine months in eliminating most 
drug trafficking dens in Cairo, particularly the areas of 
al-Batniyah, al-Jayyarah, al-Husayniyah, and Birkat al-Hajj. 
  Al-Watiri said that the intensive campaigns by 
counternarcotics personnel led to the seizure of a number of 
kiosks that sell the bango plant, which is a cheap drug compared 
to other types. The price of one kilogram of bango ranges from 
600 to 900 pounds, whereas one kilo of heroin sells for 400,000 
pounds. He noted that campaigns were launched against certain 
pharmacies, which resulted in the closure of many pharmacies 
that trade illegally in certain medicines and tranquilizers that 
contain narcotic and alcoholic ingredients. The Health Ministry 
and the Pharmacists Association have been notified.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The 30th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic 
Drugs opened in Damascus yesterday. The Tehran Declaration, 
which was approved in 1371 [year beginning 21 March 1992] by all 
members, is the most important focus of the session. During the 
Damascus conference, the latest developments concerning drug 
smuggling in the Middle East and the way to confront poppy 
cultivation and the laundering of money obtained from drug 
trafficking will be discussed. 
  During the past decade the Middle East has witnessed an 
increase in drug production, so much so that some countries in 
the area have become major heroin and opium exporters. Pakistan 
and Afghanistan are among the countries facing increasing 
difficulties from an increase in poppy cultivation despite the 
struggles by their police forces. In areas in Pakistan that are 
far from the central government and outside the control of the 
police force, drug smugglers are manufacturing and refining 
narcotics in large laboratories. The existence of remote 
mountainous regions in Pakistan and civil wars and conflicts in 
Afghanistan for many years have paved the grounds for the growth 
of drug trafficking groups and the conversion of wheat fields 
into fields for the cultivation of narcotics. 
  Unfortunately, because of its location on the international 
drug transit route from the Golden Crescent to Europe, Iran has 
gained special importance in the Middle East for large drug 
trafficking groups. Thus, the major problem that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is facing in its fight against the big drug 
networks is, more than anything else, the problem of regional 
smuggling that is carried out from outside its borders. 
Smugglers enter the country primarily through the 1,400-km long 
eastern border and attempt to transfer narcotics to Europe. 
  On this basis, in our country special programs have been 
introduced, including the establishment of border observation 
posts and roving and stationary bases, the creation of a 
prohibitive zone in part of the border region, and ambush and 
destruction operations, all of which have helped to destroy many 
networks. 
  During recent years, because of more control on the eastern 
border and increased field operations, large narcotics bands 
have decided to alter their transit routes. Some from the 
southern route have chosen Persian Gulf countries, while others 
from the northern route have chosen Central Asian countries. 
However, Iran continues to be considered the major route. 
  On this basis, efforts by law-enforcement forces have 
intensified and the number of narcotic finds are increasing each 
year. For example, the quantity of narcotics found during the 
past 11 months increased 25 tonnes from the same period last 
year. 
  On the regional level, as a pivotal country in the Economic 
Cooperation Organization [ECO], the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
started new operations within its framework. In the future, a 
memorandum of understanding is to be signed between Iran and 
Pakistan, with UN cooperation, under which the control of drugs 
in the region will be further facilitated and coordinated. 
  The Islamic Republic's efforts in the Middle East have led 
to 
praise by the UN secretary general's executive deputy in charge 
of narcotics control and by the Interpol secretary general. 
Iran is trying--through regional cooperation and by 
intensifying the struggle at home--to create a healthier and 
better society for the younger generation. Within this context, 
the continuation of the struggle and a more serious approach in 
implementing the law-enforcement forces' programs are of great 
importance.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 20, IRNA -- Commander of the Iranian 
law enforcement forces Major General Reza Seifollahi here Sunday 
said that 20 drug traffickers were killed and 11 others were 
injured when a convoy of illicit drugs was smashed in 
Sistan-Baluchestan border province, in southeast of Iran, two 
days ago. 
  The commander added that 103 drug traffickers were arrested 
and a total of 3,287 kg of opium was seized from them during the 
operation. 
  He noted that the amount of narcotics seized in the current 
Iranian month of Bahman (Jan. 21-Feb. 19) showed an increase of 
45 percent compared to the same period last year. 
  Pointing to the severe clashes the law enforcement forces 
had 
with traffickers in border areas in the past eight months, the 
commander added that the forces had also seized 80,066 kg of 
narcotics in current year showing an increase of 15 tons as 
compared to the previous year. 
  He further said that 14,612 traffickers and 43,464 addicts 
have also been arrested this year. 
  Seifollahi pointed out that the law enforcement experts had 
made a device to be employed in eight provinces to identify and 
register the number of those addicted to hashish in the country. 
  As for government policy to severe struggle against 
smugglers, General Seifollahi said that to this end the law 
enforcement forces had carried out several operations in 
Sistan-Baluchestan and the Persian Gulf coastal provinces of 
Bushehr and Hormozgan.

  [Editorial Report] Damascus Syrian Arab Television Network 
in Arabic at 1900 GMT on 20 February airs a special program 
entitled "Documentary on Syria's Efforts in the Field of 
Combating Drugs and Narcotics" produced by the "Interior 
Ministry in cooperation with the Syrian Arab Television" under 
the supervision of the "Moral Guidance Directorate, in 
coordination with the Criminal Investigation Department." 
  The program starts with a general review of the problem of 
drug abuse in the world and the international efforts to combat 
the problem. The program notes that "although Syria is not a 
country of drug plantation, processing, or production, it 
is--because of its location--a country of passage. 
Consequently, it is not immune to the threats posed by this 
problem. Syria, like other countries, is certainly a target for 
the merchants and traffickers of this fatal poison." 
  The program adds that Syria has signed every international 
agreement and protocol on countering narcotics and is linked 
with several countries in the world by bilateral agreements on 
the subject. Syria is also a member of Interpol, which is a 
principal player in the war on drug trafficking, and has played 
a key role in formulating the unified Arab strategy on combating 
drug abuse and the draft unified Arab law on narcotics, the 
report adds. 
  The program includes interviews with a professor of 
international law in Damascus University's Law Faculty who 
explains Syria's involvement in the world drive to combat drug 
abuse. He notes that a law on combating drugs was issued in 
1992 and explains the provisions of that law, which stipulates 
severe punishments for producers, farmers, and traffickers of 
drugs. The law also stipulates provisions to fight drug-related 
money laundering, he says. 
  In an interview for the program, the director of 
Ibn-al-Nafis 
Hospital in Damascus says a unit has been set up in his hospital 
to treat drug addicts free of charge. Patients, he says, are 
treated in strict confidence and no information about them is 
divulged to any one. 
  The announcer notes that the Interior Ministry is providing 
every facility to help develop the anti-narcotics agencies to 
enable them to fulfill their duties. He says that Syria has 
scored major achievements in the fight against drug trafficking 
and confiscates and destroys large quantities of various 
narcotics each year.

  [Text] A task force to combat drug abuse has been launched 
in Monrovia. According to a release from the New African Rescue 
Center in Monrovia, the rate of drug abuse is on the increase in 
Liberia due to the civil war. The New African Rescue Center has 
(adopted) plans to extend its program to combat drug abuse in 
the rural part of Liberia. Stressing the importance of this 
campaign, the organization has called upon all peace-loving 
Liberians, the Interim Government of National Unity, 
nongovernmental organizations, and private voluntary 
organizations operating in the country to beef up its efforts by 
fighting against drug abuse in our society.

  [Text] The police have cracked down on what they described 
as their biggest ever exposure of a crime syndicate in this 
country. In a joint operation in Transvaal and Natal last night, 
they arrested at least 46 members of the syndicate known as the 
Boere Mafia. Fraud and theft amounting to more than 250 million 
rands are involved. Over 300 members of the police took part in 
the operation. Teams were sent as far as Groblersdal to arrest 
members of the Boere Mafia at their homes. All their homes were 
searched thoroughly for evidence. Seventeen stolen vehicles 
were also taken possession of. 
  The suspects will appear in court in Pretoria and 
Pietermaritzburg today on charges of complicity to murder police 
officials, armed robbery, housebreaking, credit card and check 
fraud, and theft. The police have been on the syndicate's trail 
for at least two years. 
  In August last year 19 people were arrested. Some of those 
released on bail at the time were again arrested last night. 
The police say the court cases could take up to three years.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jurgen Storbeck, German `caretaker </F>
co-ordinator' of Europol by Isabel Conway, date and place not 
given; "Like All Tigers, It Needs Its Teeth"] 
  [Text] It is, say its critics, in the wrong place, and 
with the wrong brief. It has no legal identity, no agreed 
budget and no executive powers. But, according to Jurgen 
Storbeck, German caretaker co-ordinator of Europol, the European 
Drugs Intelligence Unit, it's going to work. 
  The official launch this month of Europol, in a leafy Hague 
suburb with a residence for Jesuit priests on one side and a 
high-school playground on the other, was more an act of faith 
than a warning to international drugs traders. 
  But Storbeck believes it can still justify its existence as 
a 
symbol of Europe's yearning for a common security policy. "A 
lot will depend on the leeway we are given by justice and other 
European Union ministers, who will ultimately decide where 
Europol is going at their convention later this year," maintains 
Storbeck. 
  His biggest fear, he told The European, is of 
"over-restrictive rules and regulations" which would "take the 
teeth out of the mouth of the tiger before he was even grown 
from a cub". 
  Storbeck's vision is of a strongly federalist Europol drugs 
unit with a wide brief so that "international task forces under 
the authority of member states, but supported by Europol, could 
be formed to fight drug trafficking, money laundering and other 
investigations into organised crime. [no closing '' as 
published] "I believe that in time the politicians will agree 
to a much more federal role for Europol. It might have been 
unthinkable ten years ago, but drugs and other forms of crime 
are creating such major problems now that this will in time be 
seen as essential," says Storbeck, an Interpol veteran. 
  Storbeck recognises that Europol is facing weighty 
bureaucratic and technical obstacles, not least of which is its 
"cart before the horse" status. 
  It does not have a legal identity yet and depends on a maze 
of national and bilateral agreements and goodwill rather than 
the compulsory sharing of intelligence between its partners. It 
cannot prove itself until a draft treaty setting out its powers 
and duties is drawn up, agreed and ratified by the 12 states in 
October. Its non-executive nature means that Europol cannot 
establish a formal relationship with Interpol and other key 
crime-fighting organisations or look to a future crime-busting 
role beyond its current limited horizons. 
  The only employees so far are the skeleton staff of 19 
liaison officers seconded from the 12 member states spread out 
around the huge building which once housed the Dutch 
Intelligence service. Contacts with their own national police 
force are maintained by telephone and fax, although some 
countries expect computer access to their national criminal 
files shortly. 
  Recruitment of Europol's administrative staff and the 
provision of the required 24-hour ring of steel depends on the 
member states eventually agreeing a budget. Getting the unit 
running will cost in the region of 35 million guilders ($18m), 
according to Europol chiefs. The available budget of 4 million 
guilders this year falls far short of that. 
  Storbeck claims that Europol is already proving that it can 
offer a "much faster service" than Interpol. Even without 
executive powers, the liaison officers (by the year's end 50 
will be based in The Hague) are demonstrating the commitment of 
member states to co-operate fully with each other's requests for 
help in co-ordinating information and eventually developing an 
intelligence network, he reports. 
  Storbeck says: "I would like it to be obligatory for member 
states to assist each other in gathering information and 
swapping intelligence within the new structure. But that is for 
the politicians to decide."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial report] Vienna NEWS in German on 24 Feb 94 on 
pages 44-49 carries a 2,100-word "exclusive" report by Alexander 
Czogalla, entitled "Street of Drugs," on heroin transports from 
the town of Elazig in eastern Turkey to Vienna. 
  The meeting of two Turkish drug dealers with a Tunisian 
customer in Vienna is described. According to an Interpol 
report, drugs valued at 2 billion schillings were sold in Vienna 
last year. NEWS describes in detail how the drug money is 
laundered in Austrian casinos, paid into anonymous accounts in 
several Viennese banks, and then transferred to Turkey. 
  The article notes that European investigators have been 
concentrating on the small town of Elazig for two years. They 
call it "Europe's heroin exchange" because "more schillings, 
German marks, and dollars flow to the roughly 30 banks in the 
town than to Ankara or Istanbul put together." Reportedly, 
almost all heroin shipments to or via Vienna come from Elazig 
and almost all the dealers caught by the Austrian drugs squad 
are citizens of this town. Captain Gerhard Joszt from Interpol 
in Vienna wants to bust this heroin connection together with his 
European colleagues in Wiesbaden. "According to the police, 4.3 
tonnes of heroin are delivered to Vienna every year," but only 
16 kg were seized in 1992. It is noted that the drug bosses have 
developed a "gigantic apparatus consisting of hundreds of 
followers, clever action plans, and internal secret codes." 
  The report continues with a description of a visit to 
Elazig, 
which is booming. The people drive luxurious cars and wear 
"models of Armani and Chanel." While the mayor denies that drug 
deals are carried out in his town, a member of the Turkish 
secret police states the following: "The crude opium from 
Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, and Iraq is illegally taken here 
across the border. It is transformed into heroin with the help 
of French chemists in laboratories that are hidden in cellars in 
Bingol and Palu, suburbs of Elazig. Then it is transported to 
Europe overland in trucks with vegetables and fruit and by ship. 
The smugglers mostly choose the Balkan route via Sofia or 
Budapest. In Bratislava the heroin is loaded into Bulgarian or 
Czech trucks and taken to Vienna." Five extended families are 
in control of the drug business in Elazig, while their relatives 
are in Austria, Germany, Spain, Belgium, and France. 
  The report concludes with the following statement of the 
German mafia expert Dagobert Lindlau: "Because of its 
negligence, Austria became the toy of organized crime long ago."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Police experts see a new wave 
of drugs approaching the German capital. So far, there have 
been 8,000 to 9,000 heroin or cocaine addicts in Berlin, 
according to official estimates. Says an investigator: "I am 
sure that in the future the large East European dealers will use 
the distribution network for illegal cigarettes to sell hard 
drugs.'' 
  There is also a new route for smuggling drugs into the 
capital--the West African route. The drugs come from Ghana via 
Zurich to Berlin. Since the end of last year the drug 
investigators have been watching this trend. The drug couriers 
swallow condoms filled with drugs, so-called containers. Then 
they fly to Europe and report to their contacts. At the end of 
1993 alone the investigators caught four couriers from Ghana 
with forged passports. According to findings by the criminal 
police, the hot goods are partly produced in western Africa. 
However, South American cartels, too, use Ghana as an interim 
storage site for transports to Germany. Behind the African 
gangs of smugglers there are mostly old tribal ties with a 
strict hierarchy and their own language. Last year Berlin drug 
investigators seized 15 kg of heroin and 35 kg of cocaine. In 
1992 they caught 12.3 kg of heroin and 26.5 kg of cocaine.

Kloten--Implicated in International Traffick of 150 Kilograms of 
Cocaine"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Lugano/Agno, 21 Feb (ATS) -- A Ticino police 
corporal, implicated in a vast international cocaine deal, was 
arrested last Friday at Kloten airport. He had been working for 
six years at Agno airport near Lugano. The man admitted his 
crimes, according to the Lugano public ministry and the canton 
police. 
  Living in Barbengo in the southern suburbs of Lugano, the 40 
year-old police corporal had been under surveillance for several 
weeks. The man was arrested on his return from a trip to Mexico. 
  Immediately questioned by Ticino Prosecutor Jacques Ducry, 
the policeman made confessions. He had been involved, since 
February 1991, in international cocaine trafficking in South 
America, Switzerland, and Italy. A casual cocaine user, the 
Ticino corporal had imported and delivered 150 kg of cocaine, 
making 70,000 Swiss francs. 
  The Ticino authorities stated that the police corporal had 
been in contact with the world of drug traffickers in the course 
of his duties at Lugano airport. The canton's police force 
asked the State Council to suspend the man immediately. The 
corporal was imprisoned at the end of his period in custody. 
The Ticino authorities stressed: "The inquiry is being made at 
an international level and therfore we cannot reveal any more 
information."

  [Text] Acting on information that a large quantity of 
narcotic tablets were about to be smuggled into Turkey, the 
teams of the Directorate of Police Narcotics Department in 
Istanbul arrested the members of a group of drug traffickers who 
sold Captagon tablets to the Arab countries through Turkey. The 
operation took three months. 
  The police teams established that a certain Atif Baytaz 
would 
smuggle the tablets into the country. They placed him under 
surveillance and established that he met Ali Demir, a truck 
driver in his hotel. Demir later picked up the tablets from a 
house in Karagumruk and drove his truck to meet with the people 
who wished to buy them. A car owned by Mehmet Kasar, a known 
drug trafficker, approached his vehicle. The police teams 
arrested Demir and Ahmet Gani Bilici, Cengiz Cincih, and Kamil 
Goren, who worked for Mehmet Kasar as they were transferring the 
Captagon tablets from the truck to Kasar's car. Atif Baytaz and 
Mehmet Kasar were also arrested at about the same time. 
  The teams are reported to have impounded 3.5 million 
Captagon 
tablets, the estimated market value of which is $5 million.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Samachablo Begs To Be Saved!"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Today, almost everyone has forgotten about the 
problems in Samachablo [South Ossetia]. The war in Abkhazia has 
overshadowed the tragic events taking place there. Sometimes 
the press or mass media remind us in short reports that the 
situation in Samachablo is ostensibly normal.... A Georgian 
would use this word ironically as anyone who has a good 
knowledge of the prevailing situation there would, I believe, 
not call it normal.... 
  Let us begin with the fact that the so-called South Ossetian 
supreme council has adopted a new constitution whereby so-called 
South Ossetia consists of four rayons: Tskhinvali, Znauri, 
Java, and Leningori. 
  Tskhinvali, the capital of so-called South Ossetia is 
preparing for new elections. Georgian jurisdiction does not 
extend to Georgian territory in Samachablo. The Russian ruble 
is the only currency in circulation there. This probably 
contributes to the fact that the so-called [Russian] 
peacekeeping troops brought into Samachablo are naturally 
defending the interests of the Ossetian side. 
  Samachablo and, in particular, Tskhinvali have become a 
thriving center for the narcotics business that is so widespread 
in Georgia. It is a known fact that 80 percent of the cars 
hijacked in Georgia are driven to Samachablo and exchanged for 
drugs that are brought in freely through the Roki Tunnel 
[linking South and North Ossetia]. We have also learned that, 
apparently, "brave" Georgian men are bringing to Tskhinvali 
girls aged between 14 and 17 and are now starting to exchange 
this "live commodity" also for drugs. 
  One way or another, the current authorities either are 
"unable to see" or do not want to see the complex political 
situation that has taken shape in Samachablo. [passage omitted] 
  Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Guram Beruashvili, 
a 
member of the all-Georgian Merab Kostava Society, has been 
elected chairman of the gamgeoba [board of administration] of 
the Eredvi temi [commune, embracing a number of villages in Gori 
rayon]. [passage omitted] 
  In our conversation with him, Batoni Guram pointed out with 
chagrin that, leaving aside the political situation that had 
taken shape, the narcotics business had become one of the most 
painful problems in Samachablo today. In spite of the fact that 
the Georgian police were doing everything to capture the car 
thieves and those supplying them with drugs, the Ossetians, with 
the help of the Russian peacekeeping troops, were nevertheless 
managing to secure their release. Those involved in the 
narcotics business here are mainly Ossetians who freely bring in 
drugs via the Roki Tunnel from the North Caucasus. 
  The authorities should probably devise additional measures 
to 
halt these crimes as the actions of the Ossetian side, 
encouraged by Russian support, have already become brazen.

  [Text] Tbilisi, February 24 (SNARK)--Young people of Racha 
region in the north of Georgia are on the edge of survival--this 
is the opinion of Soso Makhadiany, the deputy of the Georgian 
parliament. The reason is that during last four months Racha, 
the relatively well-being settlement, transmuted into the center 
of drug business and drug addiction. He said to SNARK that the 
drugs are trafficked in Georgia from Georgia. 
  According to Makhadiany the only way to stop this evil is to 
block the border, that passed through Oni city. The police 
doesn't control the situation, and even more, the authorities of 
the region are involved in the drug business.

Lithuania"] 
  [Excerpts] RESPUBLIKA has already reported about the 
detention of three men last Wednesday [2 February], accused of 
keeping and selling drugs. More than a kilogram of opium and 
800 grams of marijuana were found on them. These traffickers 
are supposed to have arrived in Lithuania from Kyrgyzstan. 
[passage omitted] 
  First of all, the police tried to discover the addressee of 
this shipment in Lithuania. Unfortunately, they managed to 
learn very little from the detained persons. The latter 
pretended immediately that they hardly understood Russian. They 
did not have any personal documents. Currently, the detainees 
are kept at the Vilnius reception and distribution center where 
the police are trying to establish their identity. 
  The next day after the detention of the people from the 
south, employees from the Interior Ministry Division for the 
Prevention of Illegal Drug Production and Sale carried out 
several actions in cooperation with the Vilnius police. Another 
person was detained, and the officials discovered around 600 
grams of marijuana and several grams of opium while searching 
his apartment. Incidentally, according to specialists, the 
opium found in the man's apartment was definitely produced 
outside Lithuania--its quality was too high. A policeman's 
uniform and several masks were also discovered during the 
search. The man is supposed to be a member of a well-organized 
gang in Lithuania which engages in drug production and 
trafficking. The police refused to provide any details until the 
investigation is completed. 
  While inspecting trains in Kybartai (Vilkaviskis region) 
last 
Thursday, customs officers confiscated almost five kilograms of 
ground poppy heads found on Russian residents V. Gavrilov, O. 
Popov, and I. Osipova. [passage omitted]

  Narcotics Agents at Maiquetia International Airport seized 
60 
kg of cocaine hidden in two bronze statues bound for Molini Sur 
in Miami. Francisco Javier Godoy Blanco, owner of a foundry in 
Cua, was later arrested. Godoy had been exporting sculptures 
since 1989. The National Guard has asked the DEA to arrest four 
other persons, including two Colombians and Godoy's cousin, 
Simon Blanco. Godoy admitted during his interrogation that he 
worked for a Medellin organization. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in

today arrested Venezuelan Luis Eduardo Gil Guerrero and 
Colombian Luis Eduardo Diaz-Granados Vinas at Simon Bolivar 
International Airport in Maiquetia. Each had swallowed 1 kg of 
cocaine before boarding a plane bound for Holland. The men were 
taken to the hospital to have their stomachs pumped to retrieve 
the drug, which had been sealed in condoms. Police claim the 
drug traffickers work for the Cali Cartel. (Caracas EL

  Two Colombians were arrested at Simon Bolivar International 
Airport in Maiquetia carrying 2.5 kg of cocaine in their

90 capsules, and the other expelled 80 capsules. The cocaine 
was from Colombia and bound for the United States. (Caracas

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Diaz from Sucre] </F>
  [Text] The strong party structure of the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left, MIR, and of the Nationalist Democratic 
Action, ADN, is silently crumbling as the result of the 
withdrawal of several of their members. The crisis became more 
acute following the dissemination of charges about alleged links 
between high-ranking MIR leaders--including [former Bolivian 
President] Jaime Paz Zamora--with drug traffickers. MIR and ADN 
congressmen have been observed to maintain a discreet silence 
over the issue, thus causing the two parties middle-ranking 
leaders' to leave the parties' ranks. 
  ADN leader Gaston Encina, who was previously one of the main 
MIR defenders, does not want to comment on the issue and is 
withdrawing from the political scenario. The public, however, 
would like to hear his opinion because it is known that he also 
participated in the meetings with drug traffickers, as the 
charges state. 
  The crisis is affecting not only former President Jaime Paz 
Zamora's party; it has also stained Mr. Hugo Banzer Suarez' 
party. In the last few hours, the withdrawal of several ADN 
members and middle-ranking leaders has been reported. Among the 
withdrawing ADN members is Jorge Landivar Rua, a former 
Chuquisaca Department ADN governor. He said: We have been 
fighting corruption and are now indignant that trafficking may 
have permeated the national structure of our political parties. 
I bluntly repudiate the situation because these links, 
particularly MIR links, with drug trafficking are twofold 
corrupt, Landivar said. 
  The MIR and ADN crisis is becoming more acute.

  [Text] As was said a few minutes ago, the leaders of the 
Movement of the Revolutionary Left, the MIR, have placed 
themselves at the disposal of the Chamber of Deputies 
Constitution Committee to be investigated. 
  A FIDES news agency cable refers to a particular case: 
Through a note handed to the Chamber of Deputies president, 
former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco, who is a member 
of the MIR, has placed himself at the disposal of the Chamber of 
Deputies Justice Committee. Drug traffickers questioned during 
investigations conducted by the Judicial Police have made the 
serious charge of Capobianco having links with drug traffickers. 
Capobianco today appeared before the Constitution Committee to 
deliver the aforementioned note. On the occasion, he said that 
in the note addressed to Constitution Committee President (Luis 
Sandoval Moron), he ratifies his decision to request that the 
Committee members begin the investigation. Capobianco declined 
to make a statement on his party's behalf. He only said that 
for three years he has been wanting to be heard by a 
constitutional institution.

  [Text] The FIDES news agency managed to interview Isaac 
Chavarria in his high security cell in Chonchocoro. Mr. 
Chavarria revealed some very important things. Breathing oxygen 
from two cylinders next to his bed, he said: As Jaime Paz 
Zamora's stalwart and loyal man, I cooperated with the political 
campaign of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, MIR, in 
1989, and I also helped guarantee Paz Zamora's physical safety. 
He meant that he was a bodyguard. 
  He stated that rumors that the MIR leadership had received 
money from drug trafficking are false. He reaffirmed that there 
is no link between the MIR and the money obtained from drug 
trafficking. He pointed out that he did not supply any money, 
but rather his small airplane, and the physical safety that is 
worth more than $100 million [sentence as heard]. 
  He added: I protected a man who had been in a plane crash, 
and it was my job to help him arrive at his destination alive. 
He said: It is completely unfair to hold me in this prison. He 
pointed out that he was a victim of a political plot to harm 
important personalities. 
  About a picture of Paz Zamora and Chavarria, known as the 
narcophoto, and which was published during the former 
Nationalist Revolutionary Movement's administration, Chavarria 
said: On that occasion I stood beside him to open the door of 
the plane. 
  This is a long interview, of which only some of the most 
important points were excerpted. Chavarria insisted that he 
wants to confront Meco Dominguez to refute his charges, 
especially against the MIR leaders.

  [Text] La Paz, 4 Mar (EFE) -- Radio Panamericana reported 
here that Susana Seleme, former President Jaime Paz Zamora's 
private secretary, was arrested today in the city of Santa Cruz 
on charges of alleged involvement in the drug trade. 
  Seleme's arrest was neither confirmed nor denied by Interior 
Minister German Quiroga. Seleme is considered to have been one 
of Paz Zamora's closest aides both during and after his 
presidential tenure. 
  Quiroga stated that he could not talk about arrests or 
arrest 
warrants because this is a confidential matter. He did not rule 
out, however, the arrest of other politicians linked to Paz 
Zamora's administration (1989-93).

  [Text] Oscar Eid Franco, president of the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left [MIR], this morning reported an attempt to 
abduct and arrest Susana Seleme, former President Jaime Paz 
Zamora's private secretary. 
  Eid Franco also confirmed that former President Paz Zamora 
testified as a witness before the military court in Tarija in 
connection with the TAB [Bolivian Transportation Airline] case 
on the alleged irregular purchase of five aircraft during his 
government. 
  [Begin Eid recording] I want to confirm that at 1700 on 3 
March at his residence (El Picacho), Jaime Paz Zamora was 
questioned as a witness by the Supreme Military Court regarding 
the TAB case. This legal procedure was fulfilled on 3 March and 
the Military Court already has the necessary information at hand. 
  I also would like to protest and report the attempt to 
abduct 
and arrest fellow partisan Susana Seleme on 3 March in Santa 
Cruz, a procedure that fully violates our laws. We regret this 
sort of thing happening in democracy, especially because we 
already have asked Congress to carry out an investigation. 
Therefore, these procedures only mar the image of our 
organization because the only information valid for the adoption 
of legal measures then will be from an investigation. [end

that she had been arrested by Special Antinarcotics Force 
(FELCN) members. 
  During a telephone conversation with EFE, Susana Seleme said

testify. 
  Radio Panamericana of La Paz today said that Seleme had been 
arrested for alleged links with drug trafficking. 
  Interior Minister German Quiroga did not want either to

confirm or deny that an arrest warrant has been issued against 
other leaders in Paz Zamora's party, the Movement of the 
Revolutionary Left (MIR).

  [Text] La Paz, 27 Feb (EFE) -- Spaniard Manuel Ramon Puchol 
did not die of a drug overdose: He was beaten to death by some 
military men in the Bolivian town of San Matias according to a 
report by the office of the police chief of that Amazon town, as 
reported by Radio Panamericana and by ANF [Fides News Agency]. 
  Same sources added that Captain Rodomiro Rada, the San 
Matias 
Police chief, informed Santa Cruz department Police Commander 
Armando Morin Sanchez today that Puchol died on the evening of 
10 February at the Monte Florida 14th Infantry barracks, 
following a beating by a group of military men. 
  Radio Panamericana of La Paz reported that Army Lieutenant 
Marco Antonio Mejia Alarcon is responsible for Puchol's death. 
  The San Matias Police report states that British subject 
Douglas James Morrison and some San Matias residents saw Mejia 
Alarcon brutally beating Puchol on the evening of 10 February. 
  After declaring that he witnessed the brutal beating of 
Puchol by Mejia Alarcon and other military men, Morrison left 
San Matias last Thursday, sought protection at the British and 
Spanish Embassies in La Paz, and his whereabouts are now unknown. 
  Despite the statement by Morrison, Interior Minister German 
Quiroga, Police Commander General Luis Rocha, and General 
Reynaldo Caceres--the Army Commander in Chief--emphasized last 
Friday that there was no evidence that San Matias military men 
had beaten Puchol and that he died of a cocaine overdose. 
  Puchol, 33, was a Spanish Justice Ministry official who 
arrived on 10 February in San Matias, in the Bolivian department 
of Santa Cruz which borders with Brazil. A few days earlier, he 
made a study of the Xingu Indian tribe in the Brazilian region 
of Mato Grosso. 
  Interior Ministry sources informed EFE on 16 February that 
early on February 11, Bolivian military men left Puchol's dead 
body at a San Matias hospital, explaining that they found it in 
a vehicle abandoned in a jungle zone.

  [Text] La Paz, 25 Feb (EFE) -- Bolivian Foreign Minister

"investigate the real cause" of the death of Puchol, who died on 
10 February in San Matias, Bolivia.

Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana "to whom I expressed our regrets and 
guaranteed the Bolivian Government's political will to clarify 
this murder." 
  According to witnesses, Puchol, 33, died on 10 February in

  [Text] The Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, holds the 
government responsible for the clashes that occurred early on 
the morning of 26 February at Chapare, Cochabamba Department. 
  Nearly 15,000 Chapare coca growers staged a demonstration on 
25 February, rejecting the compulsory eradication of their 
plantations. This demonstration, which in the opinion of COB 
Executive Secretary Oscar Salas was entirely legal, brought to 
the region Mobile Rural Patrol Unit, Umopar, agents who occupied 
the site. A clash was the result early on the morning of 26 
February. 
  [Begin Salas recording] Blood was shed during the violent 
repression, and 18 fellow coca growers were injured. [end 
recording] 
  While the COB asserts that 18 people were injured, some with 
buckshot, the government reports that only three people were 
injured: two of them coca growers and the third an Umopar 
officer. The COB also asserts that 78 people had been arrested, 
although they have now been released. The government, however, 
asserts that only 60 people were arrested. 
  Despite the reigning tense calm, an agreement has been 
reached with the government by which the coca growers ask not to 
be confused with drug traffickers. 
  [Begin Salas recording] Their repressive fury was against 
the 
coca growers instead of against drug traffickers. The other 
point is that there must be an equivalence, that coca must be 
replaced by other products. [end recording] 
  Salas categorically pointed out that no one can force 
growers 
to eradicate their coca plantations because the alternative 
development programs are not being implemented. If the 
government forces this measure, it would be removing their 
livelihood. 
  It must also be said that the coca growers are unaware of 
the 
contents of the few alternative development programs, which 
still remain on paper.

most of them Colombians who operated in the outskirts of San 
Jose de Chiquitos. 
  The forces destroyed a laboratory that processed 450 kg of 
cocaine per week, and seized weapons including M-16 automatic 
rifles, shotguns, revolvers, and rifles. They are also 
confiscated automobiles and houses owned by the drug traffickers 
in the city of Santa Cruz. 
  It has also been reported that from 20 to 30 top Colombian 
drug traffickers linked to the Medellin and Cali cartels could 
be operating in Bolivia. They enter or leave Bolivia time after 
time as tourists going across the border with Brazil.

  [Text] Drug trafficking has several faces. One of them is 
what has been occurring in Chapare: clashes between Rural Mobile 
Patrol Unit agents and coca growers. Foreign Minister Antonio 
Aranibar has pointed out that Law 1008 is being strictly 
complied with, and that the clashes that have been taking place 
in Chapare are essentially a result of the fact that new coca 
plantations have been found. 
  [Begin Aranibar recording] This conflictive situation in the 
Chapare region is a result of the national government's 
decision, which has been channeled through the appropriate 
Ministry of Government organizations and the National 
Secretariat for Social Defense, to comply with Law 1008 with 
regard to illegal coca growing in the Chapare region. Coca has 
recently been planted in the region, and this violates Law 1008 
and harms the international commitments made by Bolivia. [end

<F P=106> [Article by Potosi correspondent Mario Mamani Morales] </F>
  [Text] 14 February -- When assuming office as the new 
national leader of the General Trade Union Confederation of 
Bolivian Peasant Workers [CSTUCB], Felix Santos Zambrana 
emphatically said: "We are going to launch a strong offensive 
against small estates [as published] in Bolivia so that lands 
may revert to their original owners--the peasantry." Santos was 
elected CSTUCB leader during a convention held in Cochabamba. 
  The new leader stated that the problem of land will be one 
of 
his overriding concerns as CSTUCB leader. 
  According to data provided by this trade union, there are 
approximately 36 million hectares of arable land in Bolivia, of 
which only 4 million are owned by true peasants; the remaining 
32 million hectares have been given away to the big landowners 
or large estate owners, especially in the departments of Pando, 
Beni, and Santa Cruz. 
  With regard to this issue, Santos explained that "there are, 
however, 3 million of us peasants who are affiliated with the 
CSTUCB, and who are demanding that we be given lands so as to be 
able to eke out a living. We are not asking for a present, but 
rather to be given back what has always belonged to us." 
  While a few big landowners have control of most of the land 
in Bolivia, more than a million Bolivian peasants are tilling 
others' lands in Argentina and Chile. "Need has led them to 
grovel for a job in other nations, which they enrich because 
they have no future in the land of their forefathers." 
  According to Santos, an average of 45 Bolivians emigrate to 
Argentina every day from Potosi Department alone. Even though 
most of them are illiterate peasants, they are skillful 
agricultural workers. Argentine ranchers are thus exploiting 
this situation to their own advantage. 
  Santos stated that in order to put an end to this situation, 
the CSTUCB will further a policy of dialogue with the government 
so as to effect a land reform that will enable thousands of 
peasants to settle in lands located in eastern Bolivia, where 
there are projects under way providing technical, agricultural, 
health, and education support. 
  "If they do not pay heed to our demands, we will then be 
forced to invade the land given out to big landowners, who 
moreover do not cultivate it," he asserted. 
  According to Santos, Law 1008 is an enemy to coca growers 
but 
not to drug traffickers. "Peasants are maltreated, persecuted, 
killed, their homes are burned down, their organizations are 
intervened with, while drug traffickers themselves go 
unscathed," he says. 
  He contends that the jails are packed with peasants who have 
been driven by hunger to engage in processing drugs, whereas 
wealthy drug kingpins who bribe authorities never have to go 
through difficult moments if they are ever caught. 
  Santos is of the opinion that "coca ought to be processed 
and 
exported, whether as pharmaceutical products or for other 
legally accepted uses, and for these drugs Bolivia should get 
export earnings that favor peasants through legal channels." 
  This is the first time in 17 years that CSUTCB has entrusted 
its leadership to a Quechua Indian. 
  The CSUTCB was established on 26 June 1979, and has been 
headed by Aymara leaders from La Paz Department for 14 years. 
Only once was it headed by an Aymara from Oruro City (Juan de 
la Cruz Villca). Chapaco, Camba, and Quechua Indians have never 
had a seat in the union's executive board. 
  Santos advocates that his new management strategy will seek 
to "be the bulwark of a multicultural Bolivian state, which we 
will seek to establish through the integration and strengthening 
of Aymara, Guarani, Chapaco, Camba, and Quechua Indian cultures." 
  He told LA RAZON that the "military-peasant pact" made with 
the help of civilians during the past military regimes was a red 
herring to carve up the land, "but the time has come for us to 
struggle to have our grievances met once and for all." 
  The multicultural state that he proposes will consist of 
achieving the full representation for all nationalities existing 
in Bolivian territory, through the establishment of "Assemblies 
of Nationalities" first, and then of a great peasant 
organization. 
  Santos stated that "there are qualified people among us 
peasants. We have become aware of the reality that involves 500 
years of exploitation and pillage of our natural resources, our 
lands, and we have decided that we have had enough of so much 
humiliation."

  [Text] Campo Grande -- The seizure on 23 February of 305 kg 
of highly pure cocaine at a police post on BR-262 highway--23 km 
from Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State [MS]--revealed a new 
drug trafficking route. The drug traffickers now are crossing 
through the town of Tres Lagoas in eastern MS on the Sao Paulo 
State [SP] border. As a result of an investigation of fast 
fortunes, Federal Police discovered a gang of Tres Lagoas 
farmers and businessmen. The head of the gang, Osvaldir Garcia, 
belongs to one of the town's established families. 
  Police received information about the drugs but could not 
seize the first cargo of 338 kg, which was delivered a month 
ago. The seized cocaine was bought in Bolivia for $2,000 per 
kilo and hidden in a secret compartment in the chassis of a dump 
truck with license plate FV-4435 from Andradina (SP). The truck, 
which was being towed because its engine was ruined, had been 
assembled in the Bolivian town of Puerto Quijarro, on the MS 
border. 
  Part of the cocaine was being sent to Rio de Janeiro, where 
it would be sold for $7,000 per kilo, and also to Europe, where 
it would be sold for $40,000 per kilo. Police arrested truck 
driver Claudio Goncalves, 39, and tow truck driver Benedito 
Cardoso Filho and are keeping them at the Federal Police 
Superintendency in Campo Grande. Osvaldir Garcia and three other 
drug traffickers escaped, but their preventive arrest already 
has been decreed.

<F P=106> [Article: "PF Seizes Bolivian Woman With Suitcase Lined With </F>
4 Kilos of Cocaine"] 
  [Text] At 2300 the day before yesterday, the PF (Federal 
Police) arrested Editha Enelda Lobo de Ruiz, 28, on a charge of 
drug trafficking. Police officers found about four kg of cocaine 
camouflaged as the inner lining of a suitcase that was in her 
possession. 
  According to the PF, the Bolivian woman had used a resin to 
glue the cocaine to the suitcase. She had arrived at Cumbica 
International Airport in Guarulhos (in Greater Sao Paulo) hours 
earlier on a flight from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. The 
suspect was about to board Varig Flight 766 for Zurich, 
Switzerland. 
  Airport police suspected her because of the weight of the 
briefcase [as published] (about 8.5 kg) and because her passport 
showed that she had made another trip from Santa Cruz de la 
Sierra to Europe--the traditional drug trafficking route--within 
the previous 30 days. According to the PF, the case will have to 
be treated chemically to remove the cocaine paste. Editha was 
taken to a Federal Police cell on Piaui Street in Higienopolis 
(downtown Sao Paulo). She is being held without bail.

<F P=106> [Article by Claudio Julio Tognolli: "Armored Car Holdups </F>
Reveal Backwoods CV"] 
  [Text] The newest modus operandi adopted by the Rio de 
Janeiro criminal organization known as the Red Command [CV] 
consists of holding up armored cars in Sao Paulo. The attacks 
are carried out in cooperation with Sao Paulo holdup men who 
have formed the so-called Backwoods Command (CC). That new 
command is said to have robbed 38 armored cars in the state and 
gotten away with $13 million. 
  Nilo Batista, Rio de Janeiro's secretary of Civil Police, 
said last week that the CC had been holding up armored cars in 
Rio de Janeiro. According to him, the CV is "exporting" its 
technology to Sao Paulo, while the CC is sending its technology 
to Rio de Janeiro. 
  FOLHA DE SAO PAULO has learned from the Civil and Military 
Police in Sao Paulo that the Backwoods Command's leader is Isael 
Marques da Silva, 38, of Sao Paulo. He escaped from the DEIC 
[Criminal Investigations Department] jail in Carandiru (in the 
northern zone) on 1 August of last year after all the 
closed-circuit television cameras had been intentionally put out 
of focus to enable 45 prisoners to escape. 
  Isael Marques da Silva is now being named as the link 
between 
the Red Command and the Backwoods Command. AR-15 rifles, Uzi 
submachineguns, grenades, and Mossberg shotguns--the Red 
Command's favorite weapons--were used in the 38 armored car 
holdups in Sao Paulo. According to agents of the Military Police 
Intelligence Service, Isael supplies the arms market in Sao 
Paulo through his contacts with Reginaldo Lucas de Souza, one of 
the top men in the CV. Reginaldo was arrested in Sao Paulo on 2 
August 1992 after holding up the L'Hermitage Apartments in 
Jardins (southern zone). On 30 January 1993, he was transferred 
from the North Sao Paulo Detention Center to the Marilia Jail 
(400 km to the north), from where he escaped on 6 February of 
that year. 
  A report by the Sao Paulo PM [Military Police] Intelligence 
Service says that the Red Command began establishing itself in 
Sao Paulo in December 1990, beginning in the Tiradentes housing 
project (in the eastern zone), where four members of the group 
died in a shoot-out with the PM. The report says that the CV "is 
sending in weapons and money and joining with the drug traffic 
and with big names in Sao Paulo's numbers racket." 
  According to the PM in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and the 
book Comando Vermelho (Red Command) by Carlos Amorim, 
the Red Command has 6,500 armed men, and 10,000 people involved 
in the drug traffic have ties with the organization. The CV's 
activities result in a turnover of $50,000 a day in Sao Paulo 
and Rio de Janeiro. The CV controls 100 major transit and 
distribution points in the drug traffic. The organization 
carries out an average of one holdup per day in Rio de Janeiro 
and an average of three per month in Sao Paulo. 
<H5>  Sao Paulo Used as `Tax Haven' </H5>
  FOLHA DE SAO PAULO's reporters checked 18 police districts 
and the files of the Sao Paulo Military Police looking for 
evidence of the CV's presence in the city over the past two 
years. 
  The most revealing evidence was found in the 36th Police 
District (Paraiso), and it involved Sergeant Jorge Luis de Souza 
Santos of the Rio de Janeiro PM. He was arrested in Sao Paulo at 
the end of 1992 as he was trying to extort money from an 
executive of the Barun [as published] Bovery firm by accusing 
him of cocaine trafficking so that he could then demand money to 
keep silent. 
  The sergeant is currently in the Bangu I maximum security 
prison in Rio de Janeiro. Before being transferred there, the 
sergeant told Police Chief Aldo Galiano, Jr., how he had been 
operating in Sao Paulo. "The sergeant told me that he was 
working for the CV and that he had lost two kilos of cocaine in 
Rio de Janeiro. The result was that he owed the CV $50,000, and 
he decided to come to Sao Paulo to get money so he would not 
have to pay 50 percent of his robbery proceeds to the leaders in 
Rio," the chief said. "Sao Paulo is undoubtedly a kind of tax 
haven for them." 
  A visit to the Sao Paulo Counter-Kidnapping Headquarters 
(Deas) turned up more evidence of the CV's presence in Sao 
Paulo. One of the CV's top leaders, Eroi de Lara, was arrested 
in Sao Paulo in 1992 on charges of being the leader in 
kidnappings. 
<H5>  Groups Active in Prison </H5>
  The CV and the Backwoods Command have formed the so-called 
Freedom Group, consisting of leaders of the two groups. Darcy da 
Silva, president of the Sao Paulo Union of Penitentiary 
Officers, says that the group exists not only on the street but 
also in the Sao Paulo Detention Center. "It consists of 90 
prisoners from Rio de Janeiro who are distributed between Blocks 
2 and 4 of the Detention Center," Darcy claims. He says the 
group is being formed because "no one looks into the past of Rio 
de Janeiro criminals arrested in Sao Paulo." 
  A survey conducted by FOLHA DE SAO PAULO at four police 
stations in Sao Paulo shows that the criminal records of three 
CV big shots now in prison in Sao Paulo are known. One is Adauto 
Teixeira. He is in the state penitentiary after robbing five 
apartments. He said in court that "the stolen money is used to 
pay lawyers and improve conditions for those who are prisoners." 
Rio de Janeiro kidnapper Eloi de Lara is serving a sentence in 
the state penitentiary. Valteir Polito was sent to the Detention 
Center for robbing an apartment in 1992. Arrested with him was 
Leonardo Martins, who has "FV" (Red Phalange) tattooed on his 
right arm. Leonardo was transferred to the jail in Assis, Sao 
Paulo, from where he escaped at the beginning of 1993, when 
Polito also escaped. Both men are said to be links between the 
commands. 
  Jose de Mello Junqueira, Sao Paulo's secretary of 
penitentiary administration, says he is not aware of the 
establishment of the Freedom Group.

  [Text] Goiania--As the gateway in a new drug trafficking 
route, the southwestern part of Goias--bordering on Mato 
Grosso--is going to be the target of a Federal Police sweep. The 
seizure of a shipment of 198 kg of cocaine in the municipality 
of Aparecida do Rio Doce (in southwestern Goias) early last 
Saturday morning provided the PF [Federal Police] with 
confirmation that Goias is part of the international traffic's 
network of routes and that it is being used to transport drugs 
from Bolivia on their way to destinations abroad. Although the 
198 kg of cocaine in question constitute the largest drug 
seizure ever in that state, PF Police Chief Leone Oliveira, who 
was in charge of the operation, estimates that the amount in 
question represents less than 5 percent of the total passing 
through the region every month. 
  The drug, which was found in false bottoms built into two 
stake trucks of the kind used to carry cattle, is now at the 
Federal Police Superintendency in Goiania, where it will be 
incinerated as soon as court authorization is received. The 
drivers of the two trucks, Domingos Donizeth Vilani, 37, and 
Moises Fernandes Maciel, 33, are now in custody.

  Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres

the countries that have legalized drugs or from the U.S. states 
that have legalized marijuana always show that consumption has 
increased. This is why I insist on education and prevention 
programs.

  [Text] The annual UN report on world drug trafficking, 
according to which the outlook is pretty discouraging, was 
unveiled today. For UN members, the war against drug 
trafficking has not even begun. The report by the UN 
International Control Board concludes drug cartels are 
increasing their economic power and political influence. It 
noted drug traffickers are increasingly violent and ruthless in 
their attempt to control the drug-trafficking network. 
Regarding Colombia, the report states drug traffickers have 
always tried to exert influence on the legislative branch and 
government. During presentation of the document, Prosecutor 
General de Greiff said the antidrug war has been a failure. 
  [Begin de Greiff recording] Here in Colombia, Mr. Gonzalo 
Rodriguez Gacha has died at the hands of authorities. Mr. Pablo 
Escobar has died. Mr. Carlos Lehder was extradited. We have in 
jail a large number of drug traffickers, and what has happened 
in the market? Absolutely nothing. 
  [Arturo Heinz, UN director in Colombia, identified by

to be an overall approach between the narcotics demand and 
supply. This is a complex problem; it is not a unilateral 
problem in which the culprits are the consumers or producers. 
[end recording] The prosecutor general stated whereas in 
Colombia the policy is to open the door to drug traffickers who 
want to surrender to justice, the United States prefers to 
withhold evidence, hoping the Colombian drug traffickers will 
turn up in other countries. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 Feb (DPA) -- Today, 
Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said the U.S. 
Government is not interested in supplying evidence to condemn 
the chiefs of the drug trafficking mafia because it does not 
trust Colombian justice. In this manner, De Greiff reaffirmed 
the difficulties his office has encountered in its attempt to 
collect evidence in the United States against the main "capos" 
of the Cali Cartel, several of whom have expressed their desire 
to surrender and collaborate with authorities. "Colombia is 
being deserted. The United States is not interested in 
collaborating with Colombian justice although there are judicial 
exchange agreements," De Greiff pointed out. 
  The prosecutor general added that U.S. authorities are 
"withholding evidence" to reveal later should the mafiosos be 
captured in their country without taking into account that 
several of them are thinking about surrendering in Colombia. In 
the opinion of the director of the Colombian justice system, the 
government in Washington should change its strategy of 
withholding evidence and "open its doors" to criminals who wish 
to surrender and supply valuable information to defeat drug 
trafficking. 
  De Greiff confirmed that his office is still in touch with 
lawyers who claim to represent Gilberto Rodriguez, charged with 
being the leader of the Cali Cartel, as part of a rapprochement 
process, started last year and intensified in the past weeks. 
Talks between De Greiff and these lawyers have developed so 
smoothly that the prosecutor general and the media are not 
ruling out the possibility that Rodriguez, who is known by the 
alias of "El Ajedrecista," might surrender in mid-March. 
According to official reports, Rodriguez wants to take advantage 
of the decrees President Cesar Gaviria signed in 1990 offering 
substantial sentence reductions to drug traffickers and 
terrorists who surrender, confess to at least one crime, and 
effectively collaborate with the authorities. 
  Spokesmen for the Prosecutor General's Office claim that one 
of the difficulties facing this process is the lack of evidence 
to indict the mafiosos because many of the charges made in the 
past were leveled by the media and cannot be confirmed. Three 
men charged with being Cali Cartel leaders appeared before the 
Prosecutor General's Office in mid-January but were not held 
because there were no warrants for their arrest.

<F P=106> ["Text" of letter from acting Attorney General Maruicio </F>
Echeverri to Prosecutor General Gustavo De Greiff on 25 February] 
  [Text] Per the conversation we had this morning in which 
you voiced your concern about a statement I allegedly made 
saying that this office would stop participating in the 
surrender to justice process of persons allegedly linked to drug 
trafficking in Valle del Cauca, allow me to clarify: 
  The Attorney General's Office will not dissociate itself 
from 
the process inasmuch as Article 44 of Law 81, 1993, establishes 
a clear and legal obligation to directly participate in each of 
the criminal cases that could begin against people who request 
benefits for effectively collaborating with justice, according 
to the terms established in Law 81. 
  It is obvious that the presence of the Attorney General's 
Office, in the conversations that have taken place so far, only 
seeks to learn about the circumstances surrounding the 
establishment of bases that could result in the benefits 
established by the law. 
  As the legal circumstances may merit, the Office of the 
Attorney General of the nation will independently define its 
stand with regard to each case. Yours truly, [Signed] Mauricio 
Echeverri, attorney general of the nation

  [Text] National Drug Directorate Director Gabriel de Vega 
Pinzon has said that the fight against drug trafficking in the 
world has not failed because it has not even begun yet in many 
countries. He did admit that, unfortunately, Colombia continues 
to be the world's top producer and exporter of cocaine. He 
rejected the attempt to label the drug cartels as Colombian and 
complained about the international community's indolence with 
which it treats our country in the face of this problem while 
indirectly benefiting from the illegal activities of drug 
traffickers. 
  De Vega Pinzon noted that a double standard continues to 
exist in sectors of the international community because, on the 
one hand, they try to stigmatize us and call us the big culprits 
in the drug trafficking problem and, on the other hand, they 
fail to see their own faults. 
  He said that despite the cooperation given by some 
countries, 
which makes it reasonable to think this evil will be defeated, 
there are a lot of other countries where the sale of drugs is 
practically free and where bank secrecy laws are so secure that 
they pave the way for laundering large amounts of capital from 
drug trafficking businesses. 
  He concluded that the pressure Colombia has exerted on the 
drug trafficking cartels has been so great that they have been 
forced to expand their organizations to other Latin American 
countries, many of which do not give the importance Colombia 
gives to this problem.

  [Text] The International Drugs Control Board [Junta 
Internacional de Fiscalizacion de Drogas] has charged drug 
traffickers are continuously infiltrating the Colombian 
Government and Congress. 
  The board has information about visits attorneys of the Cali 
Cartel have made to Congress during discussions of the Penal 
Procedures Code and about acts of intimidation by other cartels 
when the Geneva Convention on drug trafficking was being 
discussed. 
  [Begin Rene Saa Vidal, Drugs Control Board spokesman, 
recording] One main concern was the fact Congress did not 
approve the Vienna Convention, which had been presented for 
approval in 1992, due to pressure exerted on the extradition 
issue, especially. 
  The investigations that Congress made years ago, as well as 
recently, about how certain congressmen are directly involved 
with drug traffickers have led the board to affirm there is a 
continuous concern over the fact that drug traffickers are 
trying to exert influence in parliament. [end recording] 
  The board has also denounced the vast corruptive clout drug 
traffickers have in countries where there are drug-trafficking 
activities. Concerning Colombia, the board has found evidence 
that certain cartel men have infiltrated the Attorney General's 
Office. 
  The board has also stated in Colombia little or nothing has 
been done to combat drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [Article by Camilo Chaparro] </F>
  [Text] A week before Juan David Ochoa Vasquez is to work 
out a settlement with the Prosecutor General's Office, EL TIEMPO 
obtained exclusive access to Fabio Ochoa Vasquez's confession. 
  In this confession the youngest of the Ochoa Vasquez 
brothers 
gave the Prosecutor General's Office new details on how the 
Medellin drug traffickers operated. 
  Ochoa's statement revealed routes, the modus 
operandi, drug destinations, money laundering, and their 
ties with the owners of "Tranquilandia." 
  Based on this confession, which was supported and confirmed 
by testimony from two other drug traffickers who have confessed, 
Jaime Mejia Sanin and Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, and by 
statements given to U.S. Justice Department officials by Max 
Mermelstein and Carlos Lehder, the state on 20 December 1993 
sentenced Fabio Ochoa to eight and one-half years in prison, 
without reductions. 
  As an example, Mermelstein--considered one of the Medellin 
Cartel's principal contacts in the United States--said that 
between 1981 and 1983 he worked with the cartel and helped bring 
56 tons of cocaine to the United States. 
  Speaking of the youngest of the Ochoa brothers involved in 
drug trafficking, Mermelstein said he first met him in 1978 and 
received from him "a kilo of cocaine in Miami; later he [Ochoa] 
showed me another 100 kilos in an apartment." 
  He added that on a number of occasions he met with members 
of 
the Medellin Cartel--among whom he mentioned Fabio Ochoa--in 
Panama, Miami, and the capital of Antioquia, to discuss drug 
trafficking deals. He also said he had visited the 
"Tranquilandia" lab, set up by the cartel between 1983 and 1984 
in the Yari forests (Caqueta department). 
<H5>  The "Stake" System </H5>
  Fabio Ochoa confessed to being involved in drug trafficking 
for 16 years, starting in 1974 and leaving the business, he 
said, in mid-1990, when he turned himself in. 
  Ochoa's testimony, obtained exclusively by EL TIEMPO, says 
that "he primarily sold drugs, periodically exporting varying 
amounts of cocaine, which increased over time, to the United 
States." 
  According to this confessed trafficker, his first shipment 
consisted of a half kilo of drugs; over the years he sent tons 
of drugs to the United States. 
  Of these amounts, Ochoa said that only part belonged to him, 
as they were sent through a system the drug traffickers called 
"a stake," meaning that the shipment did not come from a single 
person, but from several people. 
  Although Ochoa gave details on some of the shipments, the 
Prosecutor General's Office and the special judge of Medellin, 
who endorsed the settlement between the state and this criminal, 
said that because of the passage of time and the informal and 
clandestine way in which those operations were conducted, no 
further information is available on each of the drug shipments 
in which the youngest of the Ochoa clan participated. 
  Ochoa said that in 1988 he participated "as a stake-holder 
in 
shipping cocaine to the United States." The special Medellin 
judge revealed in his sentence that the cocaine was shipped on a 
route that started in Bolivia and went through Argentina. 
  On this shipment, the document reveals that Ochoa faked the 
import of salted anchovies to New York to conceal 1,124 kilos of 
cocaine. 
  In late 1989 and early 1990, he was also involved in sending 
cocaine to Spain, but the final destination of this shipment was 
the United States. 
  The youngest of the Ochoa family, the first of the family to 
turn himself in, also confessed to the crime of conspiring to 
commit a crime, as he set up and ran a drug trafficking 
organization. 
<H5>  Failure in Darien </H5>
  He also stated that there were links with some drug 
processing labs and that he had lent approximately $250,000 to 
the owners of "Tranquilandia," possibly so they would complete 
the construction of that laboratory in the Colombian forests. 
  Ochoa added that they paid that money back with "cheaper and 
better quality merchandise." 
  In 1984, according to his confession, he again provided 
money 
to finance a large drug processing lab in the Darien region near 
the Panamanian border, but according to Ochoa, this facility 
never operated because it was discovered by the authorities. 
  According to Ochoa, on "one occasion in 1986, he rented land 
and had a runway developed near the banks of the Middle 
Magdalena River. This runway was to be used for transporting 
drugs." 
  This clandestine runway, he added, was a failure because it 
was in an area with strong guerrilla influence. 
  The drug trafficker also confessed to illicit enrichment, 
"acquiring horses, livestock, cars, and ranches." These assets 
came to an approximate total value of $2 million. "He is 
prepared to turn over the equivalent of this amount, since this 
property has been converted into other assets, both personal and 
real estate property," said the special judge in confirming the 
negotiated settlement reached between the Prosecutor General's 
Office and the accused. 
  Ochoa also confessed that he had used various persons from 
his organization in financial and commercial operations to 
launder the dollars he received from drug trafficking. These 
operations took place in Panama and in Medellin.

  [Text] Francisco Galan, Army of National Liberation, ELN, 
leader, was transferred to Itagui maximum security prison in the 
last few hours. A petition for protection recognized the 
guerrilla's right not to remain in solitary confinement. There 
was intense activity at Itagui prison since early today. The 
unexpected transfer of Galan and Juan Fernando Ospina Montoya, 
alias El Gordo, a Medellin Cartel member, was carried out 
without a great fuss. 
  Galan was transferred from Santa Fe de Bogota aboard a 
National Police airplane after a judge ruled in his favor when a 
petition was filed requesting he be removed from the military 
garrison where he was being held and sent to a prison. 
  Ospina Montoya was flown from Medellin to the capital aboard 
the same plane. He is to testify before a faceless judge, who is 
in charge of his case, in the next few hours. Ospina Montoya 
surrendered to justice on 4 July 1991 together with La Garra, El 
Angelito, and Icopur. He was one of the few who was unable to 
escape Envigado prison.

  [Text] Alleged drug trafficker Jaime Orejuela Caballero of 
the Cali Cartel was taken to Shaio Clinic in Bogota following a 
heart attack. Orejuela was being held at DIJIN [Judicial Police 
and Investigations Directorate] headquarters after he was 
arrested during a narcotics operation in Cali. 
  The alleged drug trafficker developed symptoms of angina, 
which prompted authorities to take him to a cardiology center. 
Orejuela was admitted to the Shaio Clinic on the evening of 17 
February with severe chest pains, nausea, and fatigue. 
Specialists performed a catheter exploration and found one 
artery was 90 percent obstructed. Orejuela also suffers from 
diabetes, which will affect his present cardiac condition. 
Doctors will perform surgery to remove the obstruction. 
Orejuela is now in his room in this clinic under permanent 
DIJIN and Metropolitan Police guard. The only visitors he is 
allowed are his wife, father, and attorney.

  [Text] San Jose, 28 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Luis Fishman, Costa 
Rican security minister, termed as "not serious and not precise" 
a UN report in which that nation's drug policy is questioned. 
The report was disclosed this weekend in Vienna, Austria. 
  The government official said that this very day he is 
sending 
a note requesting "to be told what is the basis of that report, 
when it was made, and who was interviewed." Fishman explained 
that the government had no knowledge that this study had been 
made. "No UN official consulted the police authorities in the 
country. The report is irresponsible and unimportant," the 
minister signaled. 
  The report, disclosed by the UN Inter-American Board on Drug 
Control which is headquartered in Vienna, on a study conducted 
in the middle of last year, highlights the "evident" lack of 
coordination among the police institutions as being among the 
problems Costa Rica suffers in this field. 
  Rafael Angel Guillen, director of the Judicial Investigation 
Agency, also denied the lack of coordination among police 
institutions. Meanwhile Guillen highlighted the permanent 
struggle being waged to prevent his country from becoming a 
bridge for drug trafficking activities from South America to the 
United States. 
  The UN report indicates that marijuana cultivation in 
isolated areas of Costa Rica has increased despite police 
efforts while it assures that Costa Rica is becoming 
increasingly a bridge for drug trafficking to the United States 
and Europe. "In the past two years (marijuana abuse) has 
doubled, while cocaine abuse has tripled," adds the report 
disclosed in Vienna. It also criticizes the "excessive" and 
incorrect use of lesser hypnotics and tranquilizers that 
constitute a real problem.

  [Excerpts] Seventy-one kg of cocaine targeted for the U.S. 
market was seized during February by the Haitian anti-drug 
service, including 31 kg on 28 February at the Port-au-Prince 
harbor. The drug seized on 28 February was concealed in boxes 
inside a container from Curacao. Businessman Jean St. Fort 
Pierre was arrested. Jean-Max Blanc filed a report: 
  [Begin recording in Creole] On 28 February in the 
Port-au-Prince harbor, the capital's anti-drug brigade seized 31 
kg of cocaine, shipped from Curacao. Within two weeks, 43 kg of 
cocaine was seized by the anti-drug brigade following the 
seizure of the 12 kg that a voodoo priestess was last week 
carrying to the United States. Since the beginning of the year, 
brigade authorities report they have seized 71 kg of cocaine and 
arrested 17 people involved in drug trafficking. 
  Major Casimir Louis states that the greatest problem the 
service now faces is the problem of justice. [passage omitted]. 
  About two weeks ago, the office broke up a drug network 
outside Port-au-Prince. At that time, the authorities seized two 
kg of cocaine, which is still in their office, and $100,000 U.S. 
In a statement by Maj. Casimir Louis on 1 March, the officer 
denied the accusation regarding the involvement of the Haitian 
military in drug trafficking. He recognizes, however, that just 
as in all other institutions, the military could be involved in 
drugs, a military Casimir Louis calls dissident. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to authorities, a kg of cocaine costs between $20 
and $25 [as heard] on the U.S. market. The amount of the drug 
that the authorities seized on 1 March is evaluated at 
$2,800,000. [end recording]

  [Text] The anti-drug brigade in Haiti netted a new catch of 
drug dealers in Port-au-Prince where about 10 kg of cocaine were 
seized on 24 February at the Port-au-Prince Airport and three 
persons linked to drug trafficking were arrested. Jean Max Blanc 
filed a report: 
  [Begin recording in Creole] On 24 February, the anti-drug 
police in Haiti arrested a voodoo priestess who was trying to 
travel with 12 kilos of cocaine. The police arrested Mrs. Fritz 
Betty Obin as she was attempting to travel to the United States 
aboard American Airlines. Mrs. Obin confessed that she was 
surprised by her arrest because she uses powerful magic to help 
the drug pass through. She admitted that from 4 May 1993 to 7 
January 1994, she had already traveled with 30 kilos of cocaine. 
The amount that the anti-drug police seized would have brought 
this amount up to 42 kilos that the voodoo priestess would have 
passed through. 
  The national anti-drug brigade advises that last week, six 
foreigners, two men from Colombia, two from The Bahamas, one 
from the Dominican Republic, and one from Venezuela of Colombian 
origin were arrested. At that time, the police seized more than 
$100,000 U.S. 
  Police seized five kilos of cocaine in the house of Juan 
Alberto Ramirez (Azujo), alias Pedro. According to one of the 
anti-drug brigade authorities, Mr.(Azujo) is reportedly the head 
of a cartel sending drugs to the United States through Haiti. 
  A kilo of cocaine is worth more than $10,000 U.S. [end

  [Text] A drug trafficking network led by a Colombian man 
was broken over the past few days. According to the head of the 
Information and Joint Coordination Center [CICC], Colonel 
Antoine Atouriste, the head of the drug network, Juan Alberto 
Ramirez (Azurio), reportedly linked to the Cali cartel, was 
arrested on 11 February at his home in (Pegguy-Ville). Five 
kilos of cocaine, weapons, ammunition, and $100,000 were seized 
in Ramirez (Azurio)'s home. 
  Two other men from Colombia, two from The Bahamas, and one 
from the Dominican Republic, linked to this network, which is 
considered the most active in recent months in Haiti, were also 
apprehended in the north of the country and in Port-au-Prince, 
according to the head of the CICC.

  [Excerpts] President Bill Clinton's announcement of a new 
strategy to combat drugs in the United States closely resembles 
the recommendations that Mexico has always been making. It 
involves not only combating drug production at its origin, but 
also giving priority attention to preventive measures and the 
drug traffic's sources of financing, as well as "money 
laundering." This claim was made yesterday by the attorney 
general of the republic, Diego Valades. [passage omitted] 
  He explained that this did not mean that the United States 
will have a greater role in combating drugs within the national 
territory, declaring categorically that this battle is incumbent 
on Mexicans alone. Therefore, the role of DEA [Drug Enforcement 
Administration] agents will continue along the same line, 
without any change at present, and with no increase in the 
numbers of personnel. 
  He remarked that Mexico is not currently receiving financial 
aid to combat the drug traffic, stressing: "Our country is 
fighting drugs with its own resources and its own decisions." 
Nevertheless, he admitted that support of a technical and 
informational type is, in fact, being received. 
  Diego Valades announced that the PGR [Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic] will assign these activities to an 
additional 800 Federal Judicial Police agents, who will come on 
duty within a maximum of five months. They will be devoted 
exclusively to the narcotics area. 
  As for the flow of drugs to Mexico and the United States, 
the 
nation's attorney general reported that the figures have 
remained stable, noting that one of the major concerns here is 
heroin consumption. He added that, last month, one of the 
largest shipments of that narcotic was seized, exceeding all 
those for the past 15 years, totaling 120 kg. To highlight the 
number, he noted that the confiscation used as the theme of the 
film "Contact in France" amounted to 40 kg. 
  He then observed that, with the introduction of the 
constitutional amendments to the Penal Code and the Code of 
Penal Procedures, which have now established the legal category 
of organized crime, Mexico can have access to a standard 
instrument of a legal nature for more effectively combating 
organized crime. He added that the most significant form of this 
crime, because of its damaging effects, is represented by the 
drug traffic.

  [Excerpts] Claiming that the battle against the drug 
traffic has not been a futile effort, and that "this battle 
waged by all Mexicans will not be lost," the attorney general of 
the republic, Diego Valades, stressed: "The fact is that we 
cannot allow the spread of an opinion considering the battle 
against that social cancer to be useless." 
  Chairing the first working session with the commissioner, 
general directors, and area directors of the National Institute 
To Combat Drugs [INCD], Valades Rios remarked: "Present here are 
many of the leaders who will make a victory in this area really 
happen." 
  Speaking before Raul Campos Rabago, commissioner of the 
National Institute To Combat Drugs, the head of the institution 
of federal justice declared that the public servants working for 
it are the initiators of a new institutional project in the 
country. "Many doubted that the creation of an institute of this 
type was possible, and many are now admitting their mistake in 
doubting the chances for success of an agency such as this. Our 
achievements are being demonstrated every day." 
  Addressing the personnel comprising the aforementioned 
institute's top-level administration, the attorney general 
indicated that the programs already established will be 
continued, and that none of what has already been gained will be 
left unfinished. 
  The official asserted: "The commitment is not one for 
changing, but rather for intensifying and carrying even further 
what has been done with enormous effort. Expanding the results 
accrued is a commitment to the nation, the president, and 
ourselves." 
  Diego Valades claimed that it was now necessary to spur the 
efforts already expended, "not only to halt the large volumes of 
drugs circulating in the country and contribute to the health 
sector's activities, but also to restore to our society the 
confidence that others are attempting to deny it." [passage 
omitted] 
  Diego Valades added: "At times, we must exert great patience 
in surmounting the limitations on such fundamental resources as 
our physical facilities. However, I know not only your problems, 
but also your capacities and potential. We shall solve your 
problems, because that is our responsibility. And you will be 
assigned to solve the country's problems insofar as drugs are 
concerned." 
  The official stressed that the training and refresher 
courses 
for both agents of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office and 
those of the Federal Judicial Police have made it possible to 
form a professional group to investigate this type of crime. He 
commented: "We have a great professional capacity, and a great 
individual and collective will. I am sure that, day by day, 
intense efforts will be expended on work as well as collective 
intelligence exercises, that will make it possible to provide 
solutions for the problems arising every day." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Raymundo Leon] </F>
  [Text] La Paz, Baja California Sur, 2 February--Today, the 
PAN [National Action Party] state president, Pedro Macias de 
Lara, claimed that Baja California Sur [BCS] is a springboard to 
the United States for drug traffickers. It also shows a high 
rate of drug consumption. He offered to furnish evidence of this 
to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR). 
  Remarking that small planes are often observed landing in 
various parts of the state, he said that this should be 
investigated by the PGR and the counternarcotics authorities. 
  He questioned the effort of the PGR, noting its failure to 
publicize the results of investigations conducted in the case of 
small planes loaded with drugs that crashed in BCS territory 
months ago. 
  He asserted that, to date, the Attorney General's Office has 
maintained secrecy regarding the crash of a plane carrying five 
tons of cocaine. It occurred during April 1993, in this 
municipality's Los Barriles community, 60 km south of here. 
  He revealed that he, personally, had reports from an 
ex-official pertaining to the drug traffic, adding: "I would be 
willing to give details to the PGR authorities."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Rafael Loret de Mola: "The Narcos and Marcos"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] At first, the explanation of 
the rebellion's [editorial note: `rebellion's' refers to the 
revolt in Chiapas] social nature and the pictures of 
impoverished peasants carrying wooden rifles sufficed to shock 
the public and place the blame on the institutional abandonment 
of ethnic groups. Later, certain heated issues, such as that of 
the military equipment, began to be explained, putting the 
conflict on a different plane. 
  The notorious Sub-Commander Marcos recently revealed (in a 
newspaper on Sunday, 6 February) that many of the weapons in his 
possession come from the Mexican Army. According to the account 
given by the neo-Zapatista leader, the officers do not turn over 
all the submachineguns, rifles, and grenades seized from drug 
traffickers to their superiors. The bulk of the weapons is put 
up for sale, overtly and brazenly, creating an endless circular 
structure: from the "narcos" to the Army, from the latter to the 
"narcos," and so on, indefinitely. Based on the explanation 
given, the "guerrilla fighters" modified the pace. 
  For the foregoing to occur, there must have been some 
specific circumstances, including the complicity of the military 
and the complacency of the drug traffickers. This requirement is 
due to the natural difficulty in gaining access to the select 
core of clandestine clients among the military personnel, whose 
preeminent mission is to incapacitate (and, of course, not 
rearm) criminals and potential adversaries of the government of 
the republic. The tragic aspect of the story lies in the fact 
that those offering military merchandise could become the next 
mortal victims of the purchasers. 
  This shady relationship jeopardizes the national security 
and, of itself, explains several of the original statements made 
about the scope of the clandestine neo-Zapatista army, its 
financing, and the authorities' unspeakable negligence. Despite 
the dimensions of the surveillance in an agitated region, the 
authorities failed to take timely action to prevent the New 
Year's uprising, even though many warnings were given, and there 
was evidence of paramilitary exercises at various "barracks" in 
the Lacandona sierra region. 
  Regardless of the persistent statements by government 
sources, the incredible apathy of the military is irrational, 
when it was obvious that high-powered weapons were being 
accumulated and thousands of (supposedly monolingual) villagers 
were being trained. They were called upon to decide, through a 
less tainted vote than usual, whether or not to give the war cry 
as a last resort for easing their ancestral humiliation and 
increasingly underprivileged status, as well as the pangs of 
hunger, poverty, and disease. 
  Although it may seem strange, the leaders of the so-called 
Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) were always in 
control: first, when they recruited the impoverished Indians, 
and subsequently, upon becoming accomplices of bad members of 
the military. The latter quite shamelessly put in the "rebels'" 
hands the shrapnel required to start a revolution of alarming 
proportions (they were fully aware of the potential of the 
weapons confiscated and later sold) and obviously dangerous to 
the Mexican political system. [passage omitted] 
  The "narcos," for their part, have their own perspective. 
Would they perhaps benefit from the rise of an armed force other 
than their own, to pave the way for a war with social aspects, 
unrelated to the drug traffic? Since 1 January, has anyone paid 
attention to the activities of the "capos" and cartels? By 
connecting the two questions, surprising conclusions could be 
reached, especially if we start with a free, spontaneous 
confession of the original ownership of the weapons now 
supporting the rebels in the Lacandona sierra. Despite the 
meager exchange of lead (only a few days of tension before the 
unilateral cease-fire, scrupulously observed by the 
neo-Zapatistas thereafter), the weapons have served to modify 
the Salinist regime's plans, to discredit its achievements 
(especially on the international scene), and to display its 
baggage, compounded by neoliberalist arrogance and government 
blindness. 
  The undercurrent of tension is becoming turbulent. 
Determining the connections between Marcos, the "narcos," and 
certain unethical officials (who presumably marketed the 
weapons) would help to explain the real motive for the uprising. 
There is evidence for doing so.

  [Text] The highway checkpoints (Precos) set up by the 
Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] have helped 
to curb some of the drug trafficking, kidnappings, and assaults 
in the national highway network. Therefore, as the institution 
of federal justice announced yesterday, this type of police 
checkpoint will soon be expanded. 
  The office stressed that there are currently 19 Precos in 
operation, disseminated in 13 states of the republic with high 
rates of crime on highways, noting that there is less insecurity 
in those states now. The Federal Judicial Police forces detailed 
to them have arrested large numbers of criminals, with a 
presence that has prevented the commission of crimes to a 
considerable extent. 
  The Precos operate in towns such as Ensenada, Baja 
California; and settlements such as Benjamin Hill and San 
Luis-Rio Colorado, Sonora; Los Mochis and Villa Union, Sinaloa; 
El Sueco, Chihuahua; Gomez Palacio and Santiago Papasquiario, 
Durango; Las Norias (Southern Highway, San Fernando), 
Tamaulipas; Carapan (Glorieta Highway crossing) and Zitacuaro 
(Southern Highway and Huetamo), Michoacan; and 
Linares-Monterrey-Monclova Highway, Nuevo Leon. They are also 
located at boundaries: in Guerrero; Michoacan (Ixtapa-Lazaro 
Cardenas Highway); La Ventosa, Oaxaca; Gregorio Mendez, Tabasco; 
Huehuetan and Comitan, Chiapas; and Caoba and Kilometer 56 
(Chetumal-Carrillo Puerto Highway), Quintana Roo. 
  The PGR noted that these checkpoint operations are headed by 
highly qualified personnel, including agents from the Public 
Prosecutor's Office and the Federal Judicial Police, and a 
representative of the Human Rights Commission, to prevent 
irregularities and to ensure that their operations adhere 
strictly to the law. Their only goal is to raise the levels of 
security for persons traveling on the nation's highways, 
especially the federal ones. Their intention is to reduce the 
crime rate and to meet the demand expressed by various social 
sectors for a resolute battle against the drug traffic and arms 
contraband. 
  They are also required to cooperate with the state 
governments to prevent kidnappings; and, if they should occur, 
they must assist the local authorities in investigating them, as 
well as intensifying the battle against the drug traffic.

  [Text] The closing of the preliminary investigation period 
has been ordered in the suit being brought in the Fourth 
District Court of Criminal Proceedings against the ex-secretary 
of safety and roadways, Santiago Tapia Aceves; the Federal 
Judicial Police ex-first commander, Fulvio Jimenez Turengano; 
and the presumed drug trafficker, Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias 
"El Chapo." They are presumed guilty of the crimes of improper 
exercise of public service and bribery. The order was given by 
the agent of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, who called 
for the maximum penalty, 15 years in prison, to be imposed on 
them, since their guilt of the criminal acts ascribed to them is 
considered to have been demonstrated. 
  The defendants' legal representatives, for their part, 
stated 
to the administrator of justice responsible for bringing the 
pertinent criminal suit, Pablo Vicente Monroy Gomez, that, 
during the process, the criminal liability of those indicted was 
not accredited. Claiming that, on the contrary, their clients' 
innocence had been proven, their defenders declared: "Therefore, 
they should be acquitted of the charges brought against them and 
their immediate release should be ordered." 
  After this final day of the period in question, the 
aforementioned administrator of justice will have 15 working 
days to set the date for the hearing in these proceedings. On 
that occasion, both parties (the accusers and defendants) will 
ratify their concluding arguments, so that the judge may finally 
set the date for a judgment in the case. 
  According to the records of the proceedings, on 18 June 
1993, 
the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic brought 
criminal action against the following: Tapia Aceves, who 
recently received a provisional release; the presumed drug 
dealer, "El Chapo" Guzman; the Federal Judicial Police ex-first 
commander, Fulvio Jimenez Turengano; the ex-chief of the 
Oriente-Venustiano Carranza Second Sector, Rogelio Herrera 
Perez, aka "El Pispion"; and the deputy chief of that Crime 
Prevention Police sector, Oscar Daniel Salcedo Ochoa, aka "El 
Caballo." With this action, criminal proceedings 85/93 were 
initiated. 
  The federal judge decided to order the formal imprisonment 
of 
those implicated, since the Federal Public Ministry believed 
that there was sufficient evidence to establish their 
participation in the crimes of which they were accused. Of the 
group, only Joaquin Guzman Loera was notified of his formal 
incarceration in the federal maximum security prison at Almoloya 
de Juarez, in the Mexican state of Chiapas, on the Guatemalan 
border, where he has been confined since his capture. 
  During the proceedings, it was indicated that the amount of 
the bribe with which Santiago Tapia Aceves is charged had not 
been determined, because there is no exact sum that he is 
considered to have received from "El Chapo" Guzman for his 
release. Meanwhile, the nine Crime Prevention Police members who 
made the pertinent charge ratified their claim on the judicial 
premises. There, the representatives of the news media were 
asked to keep the identities of these policemen confidential, 
because of the reprisals that might be taken against them.

  [Text] Torreon, Coahuila, 11 February--In the lake region, 
adolescents and youths are the main victims of drug addiction, 
because 40 percent of the addicts are aged between 15 and 19, 25 
percent between 20 and 24, and the rest 25 years and older. The 
majority are of the male sex, single, and from the lower and 
lower-middle classes. This statement was made by the director of 
the local Youth Rehabilitation Center (CIJ), Beatriz Montemayor 
Gonzalez. 
  She added that the conclusion was based on a study made from 
1991 to 1993, with a sample of 1,700 patients; stressing that in 
70 percent of the cases their schooling did not exceed the basic 
intermediate level, and that a high rate of school and work 
instability was recorded. 
  Over 60 percent of the drug addicts in treatment require 
daily drug consumption; others, on several days a week; and 40 
percent are consuming two or more substances simultaneously. 
Montemayor Gonzalez noted that the most frequent combinations 
are marijuana with alcohol or inhalants. 
  She indicated that drug consumption most often begins 
between 
ages 10 and 19, primarily with marijuana or inhalants. These are 
followed by depressants intended for medical use, and the first 
experimenting with drug use is generally with school or work 
friends or companions. It occurs on public streets, in private 
residences, or at educational centers. 
  Montemayor Gonzalez concluded by remarking that these are 
some of the results of an extensive study made by the CIJ with 
personnel specializing in the treatment of patients suffering 
from drug addiction within the lake region.

  [Excerpt] Another sizable drug shipment, this time totaling 
three tons and 876 kg, was confiscated yesterday by federal 
agents assigned to the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic [PGR] and detailed to Nuevo Leon State. With other 
seizures made recently, this brings the figure for the week to 
10 tons. The total worth of these drugs is approximately 250 
million new pesos. 
  On this occasion, the Federal Judicial Police agents 
captured 
10 presumed drug dealers who were about to move the drugs to the 
United States. Of the five vehicles seized from them, four were 
escorting a trailer truck carrying the marijuana under a 
shipment of fertilizer. 
  The PGR's branch office in that state reported that, after a 
series of investigations, it was learned that a group of drug 
traffickers intended to make the move in the vicinity of the 
highway leading from Monterrey to Reynosa, Tamaulipas. 
  Arrested on that highway, near the La Tortola ranch, were 
Fernando Ruiz Salgado, Gumaro Garza de la Garza, Juan Ariel 
Lopez Moreno, and Jorge Antonio Gomez Garza. They were riding in 
a Grand Marquis vehicle without license plates, forming the 
surveillance convoy for the large marijuana shipment. 
  Also arrested were Jaime Ortiz Garcia, Edgar Moreno Silva, 
and Maximo Avila Murillo, riding in a Cutlass sedan, and Edmundo 
Canales Rodriguez, all of whom were engaged in surveillance. Two 
Nissan compact cars were seized as well. 
  The last one to be arrested, Jaime Ramirez Gonzalez, was 
driving the red tractor trailer truck with treads. Realizing 
that he had been detected, he attempted to escape with the 
truck; however, after a chase along the highway, he was forced 
to stop. When the vehicle was searched, hundreds of packages 
wrapped in self-stick plastic, with a gross weight of three tons 
and 876 kg, were discovered. 
  The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office indicated that, 
within 
the next few hours, the decision would be made for the remand of 
these individuals to the pertinent district court, based on 
their presumed guilt of committing various crimes against 
health. An investigation is also being made to determine the 
possible participation of Jose Luis Antu Martinez, who attempted 
to obstruct the federal agents' work. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yesterday, in the town of Tijuana, Baja California, 
Federal Judicial Police [PJF] personnel captured three presumed 
drug dealers with 43 kg and 980 grams of cocaine base in their 
possession. The drugs were worth over 120 million new pesos and 
were to be shipped to the United States. 
  Martin Torres Flores, Fausto Gonzalez Solis, and Jose Luis 
Rivas Rosas were arrested by federal agents on the 
Guadalajara-Tepic highway, eight km from the municipality of 
Magdalena. They were carrying the drugs in compartments 
concealed under the roof of a van with state of California 
plates. 
  According to investigations conducted by the agent of the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, a vehicle with certain 
characteristics was due to travel along that highway carrying 
the alkaloid shipment. 
  Hence, at a checkpoint in the aforementioned locality, the 
PJF agents intercepted these individuals riding in a red Dodge 
Ram van with a detachable roof and license plates 30X100. 
  When the vehicle was searched, the drugs were found, and 
those subjects, together with the cocaine, were taken into 
custody and placed at the disposal of the agent at the Federal 
Public Prosecutor's Office. In their preliminary statements, 
they claimed that the alkaloid had come from Tuxpan, Jalisco, 
and was bound for Tijuana, Baja California, to be smuggled into 
the United States later. 
  It should be noted that, thus far in this administration, a 
total of 225 tons of cocaine has been seized in antidrug 
operations throughout the country. Moreover, 165 Federal 
Judicial Police agents have lost their lives in direct 
confrontations associated with the relentless battle against the 
drug traffic.

  [Excerpt] A spectacular blow was dealt to the drug traffic 
yesterday by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic 
[PGR]. In several operations conducted in five of the 
Federation's states, it seized 11 tons and 215 kg of dried and 
packed marijuana worth over 200 million new pesos. In addition, 
22 presumed drug traffickers were arrested, and 15 automotive 
vehicles confiscated. 
  During the same operations, Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
personnel seized 92.5 kg of ephedrine, a chemical precursor used 
to manufacture amphetamines and to "cut" cocaine, so as to make 
that stimulant more potent. 
  The institution of federal justice cited a report from 
Sonora 
State, on the largest seizure of drugs, totaling 5,304 kg of 
marijuana, in an operation carried out in the vicinity of 
Benjamin Hill, at a PJF highway checkpoint. The PGR's 
representative in that state noted that the drugs were found on 
a tank truck bearing the label "nitrogen," which had left 
Guadalajara bound for the town of Tijuana, Baja California. The 
Federal Judicial Police discovered the ephedrine together with 
the marijuana. 
  The vehicle's driver, Juan Silva Saenz, claimed that the 
drugs had been packed in Jalisco State, and stored in a false 
bottom of the tank truck's structure. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A 56-kg shipment of a synthetic drug known as 
"crystal" (worth over $600,000) was seized yesterday in 
Mexicali, Baja California, by personnel from the Office of the 
Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], who also arrested two 
presumed drug dealers. 
  The institution of federal justice warned that this drug is 
a 
toxic substance 400 times more potent than cocaine, producing 
addiction when first consumed. Within a short time, it also 
causes irreversible damage and inevitable death to those using 
it. 
  According to reports submitted to the Federal Judicial 
Police 
chief, Adrian Carrera, the drug, derived from amphetamines and 
other chemical substances, was discovered by the federal agents 
at this area's international airport. 
  Based on investigations conducted for some time, it was 
learned that a purchase and sale operation involving the fatal 
narcotic was to take place at the airport. Therefore, an 
operation was mounted a week ago, bringing results yesterday. 
  The drugs were in that airport's baggage department and, 
when 
they were located, the PGR agents merely waited for the owners 
to show up. 
  Yesterday, Joaquin Montano Moreno and Enrique Moreno Sanchez 
appeared to claim the aforementioned packages. When they were 
caught, they could not explain the presence of the drugs, and 
hence were placed at the disposal of the agent from the Federal 
Public Prosecutor's Office, as persons presumed guilty of crimes 
against health. The drugs presumably were to be sent to the 
United States. 
  It is known that the product called "crystal," like other 
synthetic drugs such as "ice" and "crack," is being processed in 
clandestine laboratories from amphetamines. It is often sold at 
a relatively low price, owing to its small production cost. 
Nevertheless, it is highly toxic, causing fatal damage to the 
human body.

<F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Deputy Doris Tijerino said today the U.S. Embassy 
does not want the National Assembly plenum to pass the antidrug 
law, because it does not include the DEA's collaboration with 
the National Police on drug control. 
  The police and National Assembly commission that prepared 
the 
draft bill on narcotics, psychotropic substances and so forth 
still disagree on certain controversial issues such as whether 
the DEA should participate in Nicaraguan drug-trafficking 
investigations. Tijerino says the antidrug law should be 
educational instead of repressive. 
  [Begin Tijerino recording] Excessive pressure has been 
exerted on the commission to make the law repressive. My 
concern is it may repress our youths, a point that is obvious 
from the disregard that has been shown for the need to allow the 
Nicaraguan Youth Council to work with the National Council. 
[end recording] 
  Commander Leonel Espinoza, of the National Police Narcotics 
Department, has said the following: 
  [Begin Espinoza recording] Every law contains repressive 
elements, but this law also calls for a national council that 
will design a plan that will also address general preventive 
issues such as education, children, and youths; in other words, 
the law contemplates the preventive side of the struggle against 
drug related crimes, not only the coercive side of it. [end 
recording] 
  Deputy Tijerino says the U.S. Embassy did not want the 
plenum 
to pass the law. [Begin recording] 
  Unidentified reporter: Who has come under pressure 
and what type? 
  Tijerino: I have met with David Noble, and I was 
informed that before the draft bill was sent to the plenum for 
discussion it was delivered to the U.S. Embassy so that the 
embassy could say whether it adhered to international 
agreements. Mr. Noble asked me, diplomatically, of course, if I 
would agree to a withdrawal of the law from debate. This means 
U.S. Embassy officials oppose the law, because it does not 
guarantee unrestricted activities by organizations such as the 
DEA, which promotes police operations against drug trafficking. 
[end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Commander Espinosa has said the following: 
  [Begin Espinosa recording] I have said openly we will 
cooperate with every police force in the world. We believe 
certain police organizations have more experience in the 
struggle against drug trafficking and more vested interests as 
well, but such cooperation is totally fair and normal. [end 
recording] 
  The antidrug law had been stored away for over two years, 
and 
during the second session of debates progress was made only on 
Article Five, which was discussed today for more than three 
hours. The law will continue to be discussed at the National 
Assembly, and its approval is expected within several weeks.

<F P=106> [State of the Nation Address by Panamanian President </F>
Guillermo Endara at the Legislative Palace in Panama City--live] 
  [Excerpts] Your Excellencies Arturo Vallarino, president of 
the Legislative Assembly; Dr. Arturo Hoyos, president of the 
Supreme Court of Justice; Vice President Guillermo Ford Boyd; 
Mr. Ministers and Deputy Ministers; Mr. Comptroller General and 
Deputy Comptroller General; Reverend Oscar Brown, auxiliary 
bishop of Panama; honorable Attorney General and Solicitor 
General; honorable Supreme Court of Justice Magistrates; 
honorable Electoral Tribunal Magistrates; Governors; Mayors of 
Panama City and San Miguelito Districts; directors, managers, 
deputy directors, and assistant managers of decentralized 
agencies; special guests; members of the local and foreign 
media; ladies and gentlemen: 
  This is the ninth and last time I will appear before you to 
fulfill my constitutional obligation of addressing you at the 
beginning of each legislative period to deliver a message on 
administrative matters. The next time I come to this arena, in 
six months, I will be doing it to deliver the presidential sash 
to the president the people will freely elect in May. At that 
time, the Legislative Assembly will comprise citizens who enjoy 
the approval of the majority of their voters. Because of this, 
the legislative period that begins today provides the current 
Legislative Assembly with a final opportunity to discuss the 
important bills it still has to discuss. Whatever is not done 
within the next four months will be left as unconcluded work by 
the representatives who were elected in 1989. [passage omitted] 
  Today I want to stress a bill that is on your legislative 
agenda. This bill is inspired by the legal duties that officials 
charged with enforcing and interpreting the law fulfill on a 
daily basis. In addition, various social sectors directly 
affected by related crimes have made recommendations. With this 
bill, an attempt is being made to amend Law 23 of 1986 and some 
provisions of the penal code. All of this is being made to make 
more effective the struggle against the scourge of drug abuse 
and narcotics trafficking. 
  This topic is very important. It is, unfortunately, a very 
current issue. During the last legislative period, you ratified 
the Vienna Convention on drugs and money laundering. This was 
another important step to establish, once more, Panama's 
commitment in the international struggle against these evils. 
The 1988 Vienna Convention--the name used to identify the 
convention against the illegal trafficking of drugs and 
psychotropic substances approved by the United Nations--is one 
aspect of our country's commitment within international 
cooperation. To this we must add the agreements signed with the 
United States of America, the United Kingdom and Northern 
Ireland, Colombia, and all the Central American republics to 
collaborate in the eradication of the illegal trafficking of 
drugs and psychotropic substances to prevent the shipment of 
chemicals and basic substances and, in general, to provide legal 
assistance in connection with drug trafficking and other crimes. 
  Currently, we are extending this network of international 
agreements on this same matter through negotiations that have 
gotten under way with Canada, Mexico, and the Russian Federation. 
  On this occasion, we have to make further progress with the 
approval of new internal regulations against drug trafficking 
and money laundering. For several years, we have discussed a 
possible review of existing legislation on this topic. 
  The Legislative Assembly's Drug Commission began this 
process 
in 1991. The Attorney General's Office presented a bill during 
the previous legislative period. If changes proposed to 
existing laws are approved, we will have comprehensive 
guidelines to modernize and consolidate the legal basis needed 
for this struggle. 
  We cannot deny this reality: Panama is threatened by drug 
trafficking, drug abuse, and money laundering. We are not the 
only ones to suffer the dangers and consequences of these evils, 
but we cannot find consolation in this fact. The Panamanian 
people have repeatedly expressed their concern over the fact 
that drugs could be undermining the foundations of our society. 
  The Panamanian Government also has expressed this same 
concern several times at various international forums. The 
health and welfare of a generation of young Panamanians is at 
stake. The future of this nation rests on the shoulders of 
these Panamanians. In addition, we are witnessing, with great 
surprise, a new wave of murder, kidnapping, and other crimes 
that are characterized by a special kind of cruelty and savagery. 
  Without a doubt, these crimes are directly linked to this 
imported scourge. Legitimate economic and financial activities 
in our country are overshadowed by money-laundering activities. 
Drug traffickers act against our sovereignty when they make a 
mockery of our borders and economic institutions and try to buy 
people and influence with their dirty money. 
  My words are not exaggerated one bit. Quite the contrary, I 
am understating the situation. This is a sad and dangerous 
reality, and we cannot allow this to happen. The people demand 
that you--men and women who have been elected to serve 
society--take action on this matter. Mothers in Santiago, Bocas 
del Toro, and Penonome; teachers in Chitre and David; honest 
bankers in Panama City; policemen in Colon, Darien, and Los 
Santos--all of them demand action against this evil of our times 
and demand the approval of the necessary tools to fight it. 
These legal instruments will not by themselves solve the 
problem completely. They must be enforced by able, devoted, 
honest, and well-paid officials. Ample economic resources are 
also required. Nevertheless, strict and effective legislation 
is essential to avert an unfair fight. 
  The country is in the middle of an important election 
campaign. The new legislation that you deputies are to debate 
does not entail political purposes. This legislation has not 
originated in any political party and favors no special 
interests. Quite the contrary, it benefits all Panamanians. 
Our fellow citizens demand and deserve the approval of this 
legislation. 
  I wish to refer briefly to some of the items that may be 
good 
to introduce into legislation extant. These items are included 
in the recommendations presented by the Attorney General's 
Office and supported by various sectors of society. 
  In the first place, to investigate these crimes it is 
necessary for our legislation to include canons on two settings 
that it currently does not envisage: the undercover agent and 
controlled deliveries. Both are necessary to be able to 
infiltrate international mafia bands and to destroy them with 
overwhelming evidence obtained from within the criminal 
organizations themselves. 
  Next, it is necessary to apply stiffer measures, other than 
preventive detention, on those found guilty of drug trafficking 
or related crimes. We cannot deceive ourselves. We must admit 
that this business moves plenty of dirty money. This money 
starts to move as soon as a drug trafficker is apprehended and 
sent to prison. He starts to make his tempting moves 
immediately, determined to buy any weak consciences available to 
him or which succumb to his dishonest approaches. For this 
reason, it is necessary that only magistrates may lift 
preliminary measures, such as preventive detention. The 
magistrates will be made fully responsible for their actions. 
  Third, we must admit that profits can be made in this 
business, not only in cash, but in other assets, negotiable 
certificates, securities, or goods. All of these can be 
laundered and, in turn, must be confiscated. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to revise the structure of the 
agency 
that conducts investigations on drug trafficking cases. 
Presently, the Drug Secretariat through a single office 
investigates all drug- and money-laundering related crimes. The 
accumulation of files and the bottleneck are evident. It is 
necessary to decentralize functions to make the punishment of 
criminals more expeditious and effective. Also, the situation 
of drug addicts has not been overlooked in the project. 
  We must offer alternatives for their rehabilitation and, 
later, for their rejoining of society. To this effect, we have 
been planning that all of these goods, instruments, or valuables 
that have been seized in these cases be turned over to the 
National Commission for the Study and Prevention of Drug-Related 
Crimes. This commission would then assign them to the government 
or nongovernmental institutions that form part of it, or will 
put them up for public bidding in order to create a common fund 
for campaigns and programs for the prevention, rehabilitation, 
and repression of these crimes. 
  Last, I want to specifically point out a new measure in our 
penal code. Not only is it new, but in addition it is needed 
immediately. I am referring to the new measure that will 
establish penalties for using money or any illegal financial 
resources coming from drug trafficking to finance political 
campaigns. This measure, which would be new in terms of 
legislation of this kind, would be designed to alert us against 
the temptation of willingly ruining the exercise of free 
democracy. Such links would be shameful and denigrating. Let it 
be clearly understood by narcotics traffickers that in times of 
democracy their shameful money is never welcome, and much less 
welcome in Panamanian political campaigns. Let the drug barons 
know that in Panama there is a definite political determination 
that rejects their activities and their money. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Celiano Fonseca including live telephone </F>
interview with Roberto Leyton, former Panamanian ambassador to 
the OAS, by RPC Television News Director Julio Miller; from "The 
RPC Television News" newscast] 
  [Text] [Fonseca] Panamanian attorney Ricardo Leyton and 28 
other Panamanian and U.S. citizens have been arrested in Tampa, 
Florida, on charges of conspiring to launder money. News 
Director Julio Miller is on the telephone with Roberto Leyton, 
former Panamanian ambassador to the OAS. 
  Miller: Mr. Leyton, is this information from the 
United States true? 
  Leyton: I can only tell you what I know, which is 
what my brother's lawyers told me when I talked to them at noon. 
They told me that the charge is indeed conspiracy to launder 
money, and that my brother has reiterated his absolute 
innocence. They have said that there is no specific accusation 
against my brother. They themselves concede that they have 
never seen anything similar to this because my brother has not 
been accused of conducting any transactions with cash money, 
which is what is regularly referred to as money laundering--an 
attempt to convert money obtained illegally into cash. 
  According to what my brother has told them, he has strictly 
abided by Panamanian laws; all money transfers were conducted 
with the proper authorization of the people he was representing; 
and those transfers never involved cash money, but were bank 
transactions of money that had already been deposited in 
renowned banks. According to him, he has done nothing different 
from what corporate lawyers do in Panama. 
  Miller: Mr. Leyton, what about the involvement of 
companies such as Merryl-Lynch and the existence of 45 kg of 
cocaine that were going to be introduced in the United States? 
  Leyton: I repeat again: I have no information 
regarding any drug accusations against my brother, only about 
the charge of conspiring to launder money. From a newscast I 
watched before, I think Merryl-Lynch is involved, but I have no 
proof of this. My sole concern is my brother. 
  Miller: When will a decision be made? 
  Leyton: I have no information on that. All I know 
is there will be a hearing on 4 March to determine bail. The 
lawyers have already told me that it is difficult for foreigners 
to obtain bail because they have no collateral. My brother does 
not have enough resources to make a deposit as large as the one 
they usually request, however, there will be a hearing to 
discuss this matter. 
  I want to use this opportunity to denounce the slander and 
evil intentions of people who have tried to involve me in this 
matter. I have nothing to do with this situation, I do not even 
work with my brother. We have not even had a single client in 
common. Ricardo is my brother, I believe he is innocent, and I 
will support him as his brother, but we run our offices 
independently. I do not know for sure if there are political 
motivations behind this, but I want to explain that my brother 
and I do not even belong to the same political party or follow 
the same political trends. Do you have any more questions? 
  Miller: Thanks, Mr. Leyton. We are very grateful 
for your statement. 
  Fonseca: During his first statement in Tampa, 
Ricardo Leyton has maintained his innocence. With regard to 
this case, 28 persons have been arrested. Thus far, reports 
have mentioned that Luis Sanchez, a businessman, and Ricardo 
McFadden, an auditor, were arrested with Leyton in Tampa. RPC 
Television learned that on 4 March, the Tampa Court will decide 
whether or not Leyton and the other 28 suspects will be freed on 
bail. RPC reports indicate that several covert DEA agents 
infiltrated the group of presumed investors, and that they were 
the ones to leak the information and provide the details to 
issue an arrest warrant against Leyton and the others who are 
accused.

  [Text] Lima, 28 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian authorities have 
dealt a very severe blow to the drug traffickers in the region 
when the police seized 3.5 tonnes of cocaine basic paste in the 
Manu jungle, which is the drug traffickers' new center of 
operations. 
  Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, the president of the Armed Forces 
Joint Command and commanding general of the Peruvian Army, 
stated the drug seized is comparable to 50 percent of all the 
cocaine seized in the Peruvian Amazons jungle over the past 
three years. 
  The basic paste, from which cocaine is refined, was stored 
at 
an abandoned airport at Boca Manu, in the jungle Department of 
Madre de Dios, adjacent to Bolivia and Brazil. According to 
authorities, drug traffickers have started to use this area in 
the past three months. Apparently, the basic paste was coming 
from Bolivia and was to be shipped to Colombia. The operation 
was prepared by the Army, the National Drug Police, and U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration personnel. 
  Gen. Hermoza stated that the drug cache belonged to drug 
trafficker Cachique Rivera, another Peruvian drug kingpin who 
was unknown to the public up to now. During the past three 
months, Madre de Dios residents have been reporting airplanes in 
the area; possibly Colombian airplanes picking up basic paste in 
Peru. 
  Last week, the police seized a shipment of 30 tons of 
sulfuric acid which was being transported by three persons--who 
were also arrested--to the Palmapampa area in the southern 
Andean Ayacucho Department. The drug traffickers have also 
established bases in this area. Sulfuric acid is indispensable 
to producing cocaine basic paste. 
  The weekly SI publication reported today that drug 
trafficking prospers "under the very noses of the Army" in the 
Huallaga Valley area in the jungle Department of San Martin. 
The weekly notes "a large part of the Huallaga population lives 
off drug trafficking money, in one way or another. There is no 
authority or institution that has not been infiltrated by drug 
terrorism." 
  According to the SI publication, Colombian Waldo Vargas 
Arias, alias "Ministro," pays $100 a month to teachers in 
several towns to improve their wages. "Ministro" is a partner 
of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez, alias "Vaticano," who was 
arrested in Cali (Colombia) on 14 January and sent to Peru on 
that same day. 
  The weekly reports that drug airplanes leave the Bellavista 
community regularly although nobody sees or knows anything. 
"Don't forget everybody here eats when there is a flight," a 
local authority, who asked his name not be revealed, told SI. 
  However, since former Army Major Evaristo Castillo charged 
complicity between military personnel and the drug 
traffickers--charges he reiterated yesterday, 
Sunday--authorities have initiated operations to find "Ministro" 
and assert he will soon fall into the hands of the police. 
  Authorities announced on Friday the Drug Police have 
arrested nine drug traffickers, five of them Colombians, members 
of the organization headed by "Ministro" in Bellavista. The 
Bellavista community is close to another community called 
Campanilla, where "Vaticano" used to have a mansion. However, 
community residents told reporters they do not know Chavez or if 
he lived in this town.

  [Excerpts] General Jaime Salinas Sedo--whom Amnesty 
International has described as a prisoner of conscience--will 
celebrate his 58th birthday on 23 February at the Real Felipe 
prison where he is serving an eight year sentence for attempting 
to restore the broken democratic institutional order in the 
country, an effort considered "a crime" in present day Peru. 
[passage omitted] 
  Outside the Real Felipe prison, however, his assistants and 
friends are organizing another celebration: The birth of the 13 
November Movement (M-13), a nonpolitical organization created 
with the objective of obtaining amnesty for military officers 
imprisoned at Real Felipe and the vindication of the name of 
those who suffered ill-treatment or persecution following the 13 
November 1992 constitutional rebellion. 
  The M-13 will be officially launched on 18 February (the 
first anniversary of Sedo's sentencing) during a news conference 
"somewhere in Lima." The place will be announced only hours 
before to prevent interference from SIN [National Intelligence 
Service] agents. The founding documents will be signed on 20 
February during a spartan ceremony that is expected to take 
place at the Real Felipe prison yard before the arrested 
military officers. 
  The M-13 is inspired by a UN resolution that condemns the 
imprisonment of the constitutionalist officers, and by a growing 
national and international support for the rebels release. It 
promises a hard legal battle that will create headaches for the 
military leadership that rules the country from behind the 
presidential chair. 
  Surveys show that Salinas Sedo has the important support of 
6 
percent of the voters. He has become a serious presidential 
alternative, creating a new front to compete against Javier 
Perez de Cuellar and Ricardo Belmont's possible candidacies. 
  For this reason the sponsors of M-13 stress: "The movement 
seeks amnesty for the arrested military officers and a ban on 
partisan politics in the barracks. The movement seeks to 
contribute to Peru's democratic stabilization through the 
support of all the institutions and individuals who want to live 
in a country where the Constitution prevails over authoritarian 
adventures." 
  In an interview on the Radio Miraflores "Double Meaning" 
program, Javier Valle Riestra defined Salinas Sedo's possible 
presidential candidacy in these terms: "Some people go to jail 
from powerful positions, others rise to power from jail. 
General Salinas is a Peruvian citizen imprisoned for defending 
the Constitution. He is willing to fight for democracy. He has 
a military background and a seducing Peruvian character. This 
is why he must be pardoned. His sentence does not disqualify 
him from participating in elections." [passage omitted] 
  Salinas Sedo showed more concern for the possible 
consequences of the arrest of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez 
Panaherrera, alias "Vaticano." I do not know if "Vaticano's 
report is correct, but if it is, it will have very serious 
repercussions and the effects will be worse than the revolt 
created by La Cantuta because the corruption caused by 
traffickers can destroy the Peruvian Army." [passage omitted] 
  Concerning the National Police "reorganization" following 
the 
guidelines established by the SIN, Salinas Sedo recognized that 
many organizations need reorganizing. He said: "I do not 
understand why the government is seeking to minimize the 
activities of Dincote which, paradoxically, has given the 
government its best results. The only reason is the egoist and 
jealous attitude of the SIN."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on drug-related crimes, investigations, trials, 
sentencings, and other activities in the PRC monitored by Hong 
Kong Bureau during the period 15-28 February 1994. The source 
and mode of processing are given in parentheses at the end of 
each entry. 
  A German woman went on trial on 28 February in Tianjin on 
charges of trafficking nearly five kg of marijuana. Doris 
Wunsch, 37, was reportedly caught trying to board a ship to 
Japan from Tianjin on 19 July 1993 with 4.84 kg of marijuana 
concealed in a double-bottomed suitcase. 
  At the time of her arrest, Wunsch had, according to Chinese 
press reports, admitted being met in Beijing by an Austrian man 
who handed her the double-bottomed suitcase, telling her it 
contained contraband. The man, later found to be Australian, 
asked her to carry the suitcase to Japan and gave her an address 
for a second rendezvous upon arrival. The Australian reportedly 
left Beijing on 18 July. (Summary) (Hong Kong AFP in English 
0457 GMT 28 Feb 94) 
  The Guangdong Department of Public Security broke up a large 
drug-trafficking ring composed of criminals from Hong Kong, 
Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi through arrests over the last two 
months of 1993. Police arrested a total of 26 suspects, 
including three from Hong Kong, and seized 17.4 kg of heroin and 
1.2 million yuan in cash. 
  Police in Zhaoqing ran an undercover operation on 2 November 
and arrested drug traffickers from Hong Kong, as well as a local 
drug-dealer. The police recovered 16.2 kg of heroin and 620,000 
yuan in cash. Later the same day, two accomplices were arrested 
in Shenzhen and two hideouts in Zhaoqing were smashed. 
  Further raids were carried out in Yunnan, Guangxi, and 
Luoding in Guangdong, capturing the ringleader. The drug ring 
was wiped out with the elimination of the drug route by which 
the drugs were first brought in from Yunnan and transported to 
Zhaoqing in Guangdong via Guangxi for later shipment to Hong 
Kong drug dealers. (Summary) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in

  [Text] Nanning, March 4 (CNS) -- The Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region has made noticeable achievements in cracking 
down on gun- and drug-smuggling with over 1,000 firearms of 
various kinds and a batch of narcotics being seized and 49 gun- 
and drug-smuggling gangs campaigned against within just the last 
half-year. 
  Since the normalization of relations between China and 
Vietnam, the two countries have seen their border trade 
developing very rapidly while at the same time criminal 
activities including gun- and drug-smuggling across the border 
have been increasingly rampant. Starting from June last year, 
the frontier guards under the armed police force in the region 
have concentrated their strength and adopted effective measures 
to fight against such criminal activities with the cracking down 
on 152 gun- and drug-smuggling cases involving 1,463 firearms, 
7,179 bullets, 418 grenades, 69.037 kilograms of opium and 7.099 
kilograms of heroin being seized and 49 criminal rings involving 
239 persons smashed. 
  The executive deputy secretary of the regional party 
committee, Mr. Ding Tingmu, speaking at a victory meeting on 
fighting against these crimes, said that the fight facing the 
region against these criminal activities remained arduous since 
there was a land and sea border of over 2,000 kilometres to 
patrol there. In order to safeguard the normal order of 
production and living and the economic development in the border 
areas, the fight against such crime would be carried on for a 
long time to come.

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, March 1 (CNA) -- Police arrested two drug 
dealers Tuesday [1 March] and confiscated 159 kilograms of 
mainland Chinese "Double Lion" heroin, marking the largest 
heroin seizure in Taiwan history. 
  The 443 small bricks of heroin have an estimated street 
value 
of NT$10 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (US$377.34 million), 
police said. 
  Police identified the drug dealers as Chang Chi-ching, 28, 
and Chang Ming-hui, 32. Both have close ties with international 
drug rings, according to an officer at the Taipei city police 
headquarters. 
  Police began an investigation of the two late last year 
after 
discovering they might have ties with a drug trafficking ring 
headed by Lin Kwang-cheng. Lin was arrested last December. 
  Police found that the two men had developed an islandwide 
drug distribution network and maintained close relations with 
international drug traffickers. 
  Chang Chi-ching told the police that the drugs seized in 
Tuesday's raid were smuggled into Taiwan from Bangkok in early 
February. 
  "The drugs were smuggled into Taiwan at the Chiching fishing 
port near Kaohsiung on the eve of the lunar new year holiday," 
Chang said. 
  He admitted that his ring used to smuggle heroin into Taiwan 
from Thailand's Golden Triangle and re-export the drug to the 
United States and Italy. Because of sluggish sales in the 
American and European markets in recent years, Chang said his 
group began to make inroads into the Southeast Asian market.

<F P=106> [From the Press Review for 25 February] </F>
  [Text] The Journal GIAO DUC THOI DAI carries an article by 
Dang Thi Thanh Huong [Contemporay Education] under the 
headline: "The Brown Fairy in Yen Bai," on Yen Bai Province, 
located adjacent to Lao Cai and Vinh Phu provinces. Six 
different ethnic minority groups make up the population of Yen 
Bai Province. 
  Apart from rare timber, the local people earn their living 
mainly from growing poppy. Because of this, the people are used 
to taking opium and drug addiction has consequently developed at 
an alarming rate. Opium is making its presence increasingly 
felt in Yen Bai and has caused many to succumb to the magic of 
its soothing white smoke. A considerable number of people have 
been reported to have died from severe drug addiction. Not only 
is opium available in the black market, it has also found its 
way into various schools and ranks of government cadres, 
bringing men and also women under its influence. Women are said 
to have passionately turned to this habit to find solace in the 
opium smoke. 
  In 1993, Yen Bai province issued many decrees on measures to 
fight this bad practice. It has invested in drug rehabilitation 
centers and also launched repeated crackdowns on drug addicts. 
However, not much results have been obtained. That is why this 
spring, Yen Bai is still bathed in the ghostly white color of 
the poppy flower.

the Cairo Security Directorate seized 1 kg of crude heroin, with 
an estimated value of 1 million pounds, from two newcomers to 
the drug-trafficking scene who wished to distribute the heroin 
to small traffickers. 
  Brigadier General 'Abdallah al-Watidi, director of the 
Counternarcotics Department at the Cairo Security Directorate, 
said that investigations had revealed that Yasir Muhammad Fathi, 
28, a cook at the Taba Hilton; and 'Abd-al-Wahhab Hasan Rashwan, 
40, an employee of the Red Sea Bus Company, possessed a large 
quantity of heroin powder that they planned to sell. They were

  [Text] Madras, Jan. 12--The Narcotics Control Bureau (South 
zone) has started an all-out war on drug trafficking in Tamil 
Nadu, with Tuticorin emerging as a gateway for smuggling of 
heroin, opium and ganja into Sri Lanka. 
  During last year, the bureau busted nine drug rings having 
international links and arrested 27 traffickers, most of them 
Sri Lankan Tamils. The syndicates involved local financiers, 
middlemen, couriers and their counterparts across the sea. The 
seizures included heroin worth Rs.14.85 crores and opium valued 
at Rs.2.5 crores (international prices), besides destruction of 
26 tonnes of ganja on the Western Ghats. 
  Consequent to the beefing up of security along the West 
Coast 
following the serial bomb blasts in Bombay in March last, the 
drug traffickers have moved towards the East coast, especially 
south India. 
  Investigation showed that much of the drug trafficking 
originated in Delhi, Bombay and Madhya Pradesh from where 
couriers arrived by air in Madras and other cities and moved the 
contraband, with the help of local contactmen, by bus or other 
vehicles to selected coastal points for being smuggled into Sri 
Lanka by boat. A well-knit group of smugglers helped in the job. 
  In the end of 1992 and early part of last year, the 
Directorate of Revenue Intelligence effected some sensational 
seizures. In October 1992, as much as 252.440 kg of opium, was 
seized at Tuticorin and Madras and two persons were arrested. 
The drugs were meant to be shipped to Sri Lanka. 
  In February last year, seven kg of brown sugar and 31 kg of 
opium were seized near Tuticorin and four persons nabbed. Again 
in May, 66.100 kg of heroin was seized near Salem and in 
follow-up searches, 361.00 kg of opium recovered in Pudukottai 
and Dindigul-Anna district, leading to the arrest of nine 
persons. The drugs in these cases originated from Madhya Pradesh 
and were to be sent by sea to Colombo from Tuticorin. 
  The following table shows the seizures made in 1992-93, 
thanks to the implementation of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances Act by all enforcement agencies in the four southern 
States.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Despite constraints in terms of manpower and machinery, the 
bureau has achieved remarkable success in controlling the drug 
trafficking, depending exclusively on its intelligence and 
surveillance. But unfortunately, in most of the cases, the Sri 
Lankan Tamils managed to secure bail, jump it and reach home 
stealthily with the cooperation of local fishermen, says Mr. 
P.V.K. Reddy, Deputy Director, NCB (South Zone), Madras. 
  Since 1992, the bureau has neutralised six drug trafficking 
rings with the arrest of 20 persons, of whom four were detained 
under the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances, Act, 1988. 
  Extradition: During his recent two-day visit to 
Colombo to attend the SAARC (South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation) technical committee meeting on ways to 
combat drug trafficking, Mr. Reddy held wide ranging discussions 
with Sri Lankan Police and Narcotic Bureau officials including 
on the need for extraditing Sri Lankan Tamils who escaped into 
the island after being let on bail in Tamil Nadu. He said the 
1988 United Nations Convention on drugs empowered countries to 
extradite drug offenders. It appeared the Sri Lankan authorities 
were unaware of the fact that narcotic drugs were periodically 
smuggled to European countries from Colombo. 
  According to one source, drugs are smuggled in crates 
transporting the island's traditional exports like tea, rubber 
and coconut husk. Another modus operandi was to 
transport narcotic drugs in fishing boats and then load them 
mid-sea in ships bound for European destinations. 
  The origin of the drug trafficking could be traced to the 
massive influx of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees into Tamil Nadu 
following the ethnic turmoil that erupted in the early 80s. Some 
of them, having found their economic roots totally cut off, saw 
an easy means of sustaining themselves by drug trafficking with 
the help of many relatives who had found refuge in West European 
countries.

<F P=106> [Article signed E. In.: "Fight Against International Drug </F>
Traffic: France and Morocco Adopt a Drug Cooperation Program"] 
  [Text] The fourth leading exporter of cannabis resin 
worldwide, Morocco remains the main supplier of hashish imported 
into France. Faced with this unpleasant economic fact 
(unpleasant for King Hassan II's allies), late last week Paris 
and Rabat adopted a cooperation program to fight drugs. 
  The joint action plan, which reflects the Moroccan 
authorities' change of attitude since the fall of 1992, aims to 
reduce the Moroccan production of cannabis resin, which the Drug 
Geopolitical Observation Council estimated at more than 1,500 
tons in 1992, for about 30,000 hectares [ha] under 
cultivation.[.sup]1[/] The Moroccan king corrected that 
figure, mentioning 50,000 ha under cultivation. 
  In traditional cannabis-growing areas, i.e., the Rif and the 
northern provinces, French-Moroccan cooperation will involve 
projects to develop tourism and mountain economy and create 
small- and mid-size businesses, as well as agronomic research 
and drinking-water supply projects. 
  On the repressive side, the plan of action mentions the 
organization of seminars on police and customs methods, the 
exchange of information on trafficker networks, and improved 
judicial cooperation. Seventy years after the French state 
authorized cannabis growing in northern Morocco, under the 
control of the Moroccan Bureau of Kif and Tobacco, 
French-Moroccan cooperation comes up to the expectations of the 
European Council which, in December, adopted a specific program 
to fight drug in Morocco, and invited member states to sign 
bilateral agreements.

  [Text] Islamabad -- The money generated by narcotics 
business in Pakistan amounts to 25 percent of the shadow economy 
i.e five percent of the total gross domestic product (GDP). 
This was stated by the International Narcotics Control Board 
[INCB] member while launching the Board's annual world drug 
report for the year 1993. Matti Teravainen Director of UNDCP 
[United Nations Drug Control Program] launched the report at the 
UN Center on Monday. 
  According to the UN member internal drug sales in Pakistan 
were generating a revenue of 1.2 billion dollars while the 
illegal export earnings amounted to 1.3 billion dollars 
annually. It was also said that half of the opium produced in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan was consumed locally. 
  The representatives expressed satisfaction over the efforts 
made by the Government of Pakistan to curb the drug menace. 
Both the Pakistani and UN representatives were of the view that 
the unstable situation in Afghanistan was one of the main factor 
hindering the proper checking of drug trafficking across the 
border. Secretary Narcotics Board, Dil Jan Khan was absolutely 
silent over some of the questions put by Press reporters. The 
Secretary revealed to the newsmen that the government was 
serious in dealing with drug cartels and said that the 
government had disqualified several politicians and had laws to 
forfeit the property of drug-barons. Why are the politicians 
only disqualified and not imprisoned came a question from a 
reporter which the Secretary did not answer. 
  According to the Report of the INCB the drug situation has 
worsened during the past two decades. The report draws 
attention to the more use of synthetic stimulants in all regions 
of the world. They report reveals substantial seizures of 
fenetylline [as published] tablets in the Middle East, smuggling 
of amphetamines and pemoline [as published] in West Africa. 
Amphetamines abuses in the Scandinavia and other parts of 
Europe including designers drugs were also said to be growing at 
an alarming rate in America and Asia. 
  The Report of the INBC says that Afghanistan is one of the 
largest producer of opium in the world with 57,000 hectares 
under poppy cultivation and 2,000 tonnes production of raw opium 
annually. The opium production in Pakistan is estimated to be 
140 to 180 tonnes annually. Most of the processing of opium 
into heroin is believed to take place in Tirah area of the 
Khyber District close to the Afghanistan border with 100 heroin 
laboratories operating in the region. 
  According to an estimate mentioned in the Report about 70 to 
80 per cent of the heroin seized in Europe in 1992 had 
originated from Pakistan and Afghanistan and reached Europe via 
Balkan route i.e. through Iran and Turkey which is the main 
route of drug trade.

  [Text] Windhoek Feb 27 SAPA -- Africa continued to be the 
weakest link in the international war against drugs, with 
cannabis (dagga) the continents' most abused drug, according to 
a new report. Fifteen african countries were not party to any 
drug-control treaty, according to the International Narcotics 
Control Board (INCB) 1993 report. 
  It said the worldwide drug menace had outgrown its 
traditional classification as a criminal and social issue to 
penetrate international politics and economics. 
  Although the INCB recognised prevailing political, economic, 
social and even climatic conditions that created obstacles for 
African governments, it said limited law enforcement and weak 
control over the pharmaceutical market had contributed to 
increased drug abuse. Increased cultivation of dagga was 
attributed to growing domestic demand and trafficking to 
European markets. Supplies came from local cultivation and 
regional trafficking, said the report, which annually reviews 
the world drug scene and international compliance with three 
major drug control treaties. 
  Heroin abuse, which a few years ago was a limited 
phenomenon, 
was increasing because African airports were being used to 
smuggle the drug into mainly European markets. A similar trend 
had been observed with cocaine, mainly in west Africa. 
  The current drug pattern in Africa showed how quickly abuse 
and trafficking could spread in a region, notably central Africa 
and most recently to southern Africa where the report 
highlighted the illicit manufacture and distribution of 
methaqualone (mandrax). 
  Established in 1968 as an independent and quasi-judicial 
organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug 
conventions, the INCB seeks to identify weaknesses in national 
and international drug control.
