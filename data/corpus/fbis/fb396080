  [Text] Brasilia -- The Cuban Government will sell Brazil 
$30 million in generic medicines that will arrive in the country 
between 30 and 60 days. This commercial agreement will be used 
to pay part of the Cuban debt with Brazil, which totals $48 
million. This was reported by Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage 
D'Avila, who is visiting Brazil to negotiate investment 
strategies in the country. 
  Lage met yesterday with President Itamar Franco and with 
Health Minister Henrique Santillo. Lage stated that Cuba is 
able to supply several medicines to Brazil at good prices. He 
said Cuba can sell Brazil generic medicines, like antibiotics 
and anesthetics. 
  Carlos Lage explained that the Cuban Government is 
"patiently" awaiting the Brazilian discussion over the 
effectiveness of the anti-meningitis meningococcic B-type 
vaccine produced in Cuba. "We are aware this issue is being 
thoroughly discussed in Brazil but I would like to remind 
everyone that we are the scientific proof of the vaccine's 
effectiveness."

those younger than five." He said: "This is the only 
meningitis vaccine that exists so we are going to use it."

<F P=106> [Article by Edmilson Silva "especially" for O ESTADO] </F>
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- The argument among health experts 
on the effectiveness of the Cuban anti-meningitis vaccine is 
continuing. In Rio de Janeiro County the death rate from 
meningitis is also subject to debate. According to National 
Meningitis Commission [CNM] Chairwoman Marilia Bulhoes, the 
death rate is declining. Meanwhile, Municipal Health Secretary 
Ronaldo Gazolla and Keyla Marzochi, head of the biological 
sciences department of the National Public Health School 
sponsored by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, claim that the death 
rate from meningitis is high and worrisome. 
  Approximately 5 million doses of expired anti-meningitis 
vaccine still are being kept in cold storage at the Athaualpa de 
Paiva Foundation facilities in a Rio de Janeiro suburb. The 
Cuban Government promised to replace the lot free of charge as 
soon as news about the loss worth some $50 million hit the press. 
  The CNM chairwoman advised Health Minister Henrique Santillo 
against importing the vaccine on the grounds that it does not 
protect children younger than four, the age bracket most 
vulnerable to meningitis. The champions of the Cuban vaccine 
argue that despite the fact that it does not offer total 
protection, the Cuban vaccine is the only one that has been 
tested in Brazil with an average success rate of 70 percent. 
  The matter is far from closed. On 8 February, the CNM will 
meet in Brasilia once more. Meanwhile, the United States is 
testing a similar vaccine in Chile that could become available 
on the market very soon. 
  According to Bulhoes, the CNM chose not to use the Cuban 
vaccine after the Adolfo Lutz Institute in Sao Paulo conducted 
studies that showed a significant increase in antibodies, 
meaning immunity, in only 22 percent of the children ages 23 
months or less, in 45 percent of the children between 24 and 47 
months, and in 42 percent of children between 48 and 53 months. 
When used in Amapa State, the same vaccine increased the 
immunity of only 12 percent of the children who had been 
vaccinated. Health expert Keyla Marzochi claims that studies 
showed that the vaccine was effective in "at least" 70 percent 
of the children four years and older in Sao Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro. 
  Marzochi reported that in Rio de Janeiro County the 
vaccine's 
average rate of success for children between six months and nine 
years was 74 percent, while for those four years or older the 
rate of success was 82 percent. Marzochi stated that the Adolfo 
Lutz Institute conducted laboratory rather than epidemiological 
studies. Laboratory testing uses significantly smaller samples. 
  Marzochi argued: "Bearing in mind that the World Health 
Organization (WHO) recommends a vaccine against leishmaniasis, a 
nonfatal disease, whose rate of success is only 50 percent, why 
shouldn't we use a vaccine that gives protection to an average 
of 70 percent of those who have been vaccinated?" 
  The first lot of 5 million doses of Cuban vaccine against 
B-type meningitis were purchased at $10 per dose on instructions 
from former Health Minister Alceni Guerra, on the advice of 
then-Health Ministry Secretary General Augusto Farias, the 
brother of Paulo Cesar Farias. In 1990 and 1991, the death rate 
from meningitis stood at 15 percent of those who caught the 
disease; in 1992 it climbed to 19 percent, and in 1993 it 
reached 23 percent. 
  Rio de Janeiro Municipal Health Secretary Ronaldo Gazzola 
spoke in favor of using the vaccine in Rio de Janeiro and 
pointed out that the main concern that prompted him to suggest 
to Health Minister Santillo to import the Cuban vaccine was the 
upswing in the death rate. Marozchi feels that just replacing 
the Cuban vaccine would not be enough. "The best thing for 
Brazil would be for the deal to include an agreement on the 
transfer of technology so the vaccine could be produced in 
Brazil."

<F P=106> [Report by journalist Eva Alvarez at Convention Center in </F>
Havana -- live] 
  [Text] Today, here at the Convention Center, a meeting took 
place between the American Association of Medicine -- Cuba is 
vice president of the Latin American chapter of this 
association; the Cuban Minstry of Public Health; and a 
delegation from the International Studies Center, presided over 
by Wayne Smith. This delegation has been invited to this 
workshop. 
  The topic of the discussions this morning was public health 
in Cuba, its situation and predictions; the same topic, but 
regarding the United States; and two other points that were 
developed in the afternoon having to do with the consequences of 
the blockade on Cuban public health care, and the program of 
health care reform proposed by Clinton. 
  For the U.S., it was learned from author (Sara Santana) that 
the Cuban health care system offers indisputable advantages over 
the American one, where an integrated health care system does 
not exist, nor any connection between assistance and prevention. 
Teaching and [words indistinct] research are problems for each 
institution. 
  Dr. (Pablo Castro) presented for the Cuban side the 
development of Cuban health care, the increase in hospital beds, 
expansion of the physicians' corps by over 27,000 doctors, 
development of the teaching system and the medico-pharmaceutical 
industry, and the guidelines and objectives set forth for the 
year 2,000 -- among them, notably, redefining strategy because 
contagious and infectious diseases have been conquered, the 
battle now being focused on non- contagious chronic illnesses, 
such as [word indistinct] in 50 percent of fatal cases. 
  This has been Eva Alvarez reporting on the Cuba-United 
States 
meeting on health for Radio Rebelde's Exclusive program.

  [Excerpts] The spread of typhoid fever in the residence 
halls in Annaba in the past few days has led to the interruption 
of studies and prompted calls for an investigation into the 
origin of this disease. Medical reports released in Annaba 
indicated that the threat of typhoid was over; 27 cases were 
still in the hospital out of the 38 cases that had been treated, 
with eight cases confirmed as typhoid. [passage omitted] 
  It is worth noting that the governor of Annaba has set up an 
emergency plan to fight this disease and is coordinating efforts 
with the health centers and university hospitals in the province 
with a view to carrying out the necessary tests and determining 
the exact number of cases among the students.

  [Text] Kopargaon, January 14 (PTI) -- The Central 
government has formed an "AIDS-control board" in every state 
under the presidentship of the state health secretary, according 
to a spokesman of the Union Health Ministry. 
  The Centre will provide full financial assistance to the 
board, the spokesman told newsmen at Shirdi, near here. 
  He said AIDS could be brought under control if social 
organisations support and actively participate in the fieldwork. 
  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), by 1996 
about three million people in India may be HIV positive and 
1,79,000 [as printed] of them are likely to be affected by AIDS, 
he said, adding that there were 16,000 HIV positive cases as of 
December 1993 in Maharashtra. 
  As per available figures, 116 patients were affected by 
AIDS, 
72 in Bombay, 21 in Pune, Thane 9, Nagpur 4, Jalgaon 2, Yavatmal

  [Text] Madras, Jan. 24 -- In the first ever study of HIV 
infection among leprosy patients, doctors at the Central Leprosy 
Teaching and Research Institute, Chengalpattu in Tamil Nadu have 
found that 19 out of 1,172 persons screened carried the virus. 
  According to a paper presented at the 18th biennial 
conference of the Indian Association of Leprologists which 
concluded here on Saturday, the study was conducted in two 
phases among patients above 16 years of age belonging to both 
sexes. In the first phase, out of the 463 patients screened, 14 
were found to carry the virus. In the second phase 5 out of 709 
patients tested positive. 
  Asked about the objective of the study, Dr. Gupte of ICMR 
[Indian Council of Medical Research], President, Indian 
Leprologists Association, said that many AIDS patients had been 
found to be infected by bacterial diseases like tuberculosis in 
the final stages of the disease. Hence such studies could 
explore the possibility of their contracting leprosy, which also 
was caused by bacteria.

  [Text] Madras, Jan. 24 -- While the West claims to have 
almost obliterated leprosy, India has the unique and disturbing 
distinction of having more than half the number of leprosy 
patients in the world. The reality becomes even starker when 
statistics reveal that out of every 10,000 in Tamil Nadu, 11 
persons have leprosy and in some tribal pockets in Kerala the 
incidence is so high that 30 out of every 1,000 suffer from this 
disease which still raises instant revulsion on anybody's face a 
manifestation of the stereotyped perception about the disease. 
  At present, achieving a leprosy-free condition is only a 
distant possibility and the plausible target before the 
leprologists in the country is to bring the incidence down to 
one in 10,000 by the turn of the century. Even this demands 
untiring and committed endeavour on the part of leprologists and 
depends on various other factors including treatment regimen and 
diagnostic facilities, public awareness, authentic information 
on the subject, etc. A plethora of information on various 
aspects of leprosy was deliberated upon at the 18th biennial 
conference of the Indian Association of Leprologists held 
recently at Madras. 
<H5>  Significant Findings </H5>
  About 300 delegates from all over the country and a few from 
abroad participated in the conference. Several scientific papers 
and findings of various projects on diverse aspects of the 
disease were presented of which some findings were very 
significant and encouraging, Dr. Simon, Organising secretary of 
the conference said. According to one study conducted by Dr. C. 
Appanraj, district leprosy officer, Tuticorin, even infants were 
found to have been infected by leprosy, defying popular belief 
that the incubation period of the causative bacterium was very 
long and intra-uterine infection was not possible. The infection 
was found even in a two and a half month old baby. This study 
warrants that all children with suspicious lesions should be 
evaluated, irrespective of their age. 
  Another study on the effect of Multi Drug Therapy (MDT) on 
Women, by Dr. K. Bhaskar Subuddhi of the Gandhi Memorial Leprosy 
Foundation, Wardha, Maharashtra, revealed that the eradication 
of leprosy would be earlier among women than men. The study 
showed that the incidence rate, prevalence rate, relapse rate 
and child incidence rate were always less among females. A paper 
presented by a group of doctors of B.S. Medical College, 
Bankura, West Bengal, showed that 5 percent of the 2,000 
patients selected for study were found to be blind either in one 
eye or both the eyes. The study reiterated the fact that 
although the regimen of MDT had reduced ocular leprosy, many 
instances of blindness were still found among leprosy patients. 
About 40 percent of them were blind in both the eyes and 68 
percent of them curable. 
  A paper on the new, four week regimen of treatment by Dr. 
Amar Kant Jha Amar of the Patna Medical College Hospital 
indicated that the method was very effective, well tolerated and 
needed wider trials. Various papers covering the entire gamut of 
leprosy were also presented and evaluated at the conference. 
<H5>  Fresh Cases </H5>
  Dr. M.D. Gupte of the ICMR, president of the Indian 
Leprologists Association told THE HINDU that still substantial 
number of fresh cases of leprosy were being reported. The 
findings of the experiment of vaccines, MW and ICRC, currently 
being conducted in Tamil Nadu, will be available by 1998 and if 
the results were positive it would go a long way in the 
eradication of the disease. It is the first study of its kind in 
the world. The incidence of single lesion leprosy was 
widespread, but 60-70 percent of it healed without treatment, he 
said. The experiments on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PRC) and 
Molecular Biology were in the preliminary stages and the results 
would be useful for the detection of leprosy. The participation 
of the younger generation at the conference was encouraging, he 
said. 
  And a piece of advice by Dr. Simon: "Please don't turn the 
health visitor away. Anybody can contract the disease, whether 
rich or poor, it is completely curable and early detection is 
very important for treatment."

  [Text] Varanasi, Jan 28 -- There are about 1.7 million 
cancer patients in India and about 30,000 to 35,000 people die 
annually from this disease, a medical expert warned today. 
  Dr. S.P. Kohli, Deputy Director General, Ministry of Health 
told the first international conference of the Indian 
Association of Alliative Care here that cancer is no longer a 
problem of developed countries but a matter of concern for 
developing countries also. 
  She said the problem had acquired greater magnitude due to 
an 
increase in life expectancy resulting in a greater ratio of old 
people in the population, increase in population, improved life 
style as well as modernisation. 
  In India, breast, cervix and uterus cancer was most common 
in 
women while men were more prone to mouth, larynx and lung cancer. 
  These types of cancer were tobacco-related and could be 
prevented by proper education, creating awareness and stopping 
tobacco intake. 
  Lung cancer was nearly nine times more common in smokers 
than 
in non-smokers, Dr. Kohli said. 
  Considering this, the Union Government had chalked out a 
plan 
of action for prevention of cancer at an early stage, prevention 
of tobacco intake in any form, early diagnosis of cancer 
specially in cervic, breast and mouth. 
  She said that it was most unfortunate that most of the 
cancer 
patients in India reported at a very advanced stage in hospitals 
and regional cancer centres, rendering the therapy ineffective. 
  She suggested that since there were more advanced cancer 
cases in India, Palliative therapy should be provided to such 
patients effectively. 
  In India, 30 percent of the cancer cases could not be 
treated 
with active therapy and "we could provide only palliative 
therapy in such cases," Dr. Kohli said. 
  Cancer pain is not an imitable part of cancer, contrary to 
common belief. Little is done to alleviate pain simply due to 
inadequacy of medical education in cancer pain therapy, she said. 
  Medical students were taught to treat cancer but not cancer 
pain. She suggested introduction of pain relief and palliative 
care education at undergraduate and post-graduate teaching level. 
  The Union Government had started producing oral morphine in 
collaboration with the World Health Organisation directly to 10 
identified regional cancer centres. There was a proposal to 
provide oral morphine to other teaching government medical 
institutions, too. 
  She said that morphine was the cheapest and most effective 
pain killer in cancer. Pain could be minimised in 80 to 98 
percent of cancer cases if right drug in right dose and at right 
time was given, she said.

  [Text] A new explanation for the Iraqi curse, a disease 
plaguing thousands of U.S. and British troops who served during 
the anti-Iraq aggression, has surfaced. The U.S. television 
network CNN today said that an official of the British Lyon 
Corporation, which specializes in the production of sweets and 
chocolates, has revealed that U.S. counterparts used banned 
chemical products in the production of sweets that were 
specially prepared for the U.S. troops taking part in the Gulf 
war. 
  CNN quoted Edward Harrison as saying that if it were not for 
the chemical products used in the production of sweets, the 
sweets corporations would not have been able to cope with the 
problem presented by chocolate melting under the extremely high 
temperature in Saudi Arabia, where the U.S. troops were deployed. 
  It is to be recalled that U.S. troops complained that the 
sweets they received at the time were not in good shape. This 
prompted the U.S. military command to ask U.S. sweets 
corporations to find a rapid solution to this problem. 
  An official source in Baghdad commented on this news report, 
saying that the U.S. Department of Defense is making various 
attempts and promoting various lies to obliterate the facts 
pertaining to the mysterious disease that has plagued U.S. and 
British troops. Independent U.S. scientific quarters, he added, 
have said that the cause of this disease is the handling of 
shells coated with depleted uranium, which produces radioactive 
reactions inside vehicles, aircraft, and tanks, thus affecting 
the health of troops, not to mention the impact the on 
environment.

  [Excerpt] Baghdad, Feb 7 (INA) -- A recent report by a Food 
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) mission has confirmed earlier 
conclusions by another FAO/WFP survey that warns of a rapid 
deterioration in food supply situation throughout Iraq. The 
present mission report, issued in December last year, notes with 
deep concerns the prevalence of several commonly recognized 
pre-famine indicators. These conclusions, based on observations 
and interviews in several areas of the country, confirm the 
presence of such indicators as very high food prices, collapse 
of private incomes, depletion of personal assets as well as 
rapidly increasing numbers of the destitutes. Following is the 
fourth part of the FAO mission report: 
  The shortage in water supply has led to severe problems in 
hygiene. According to health authorities outbreaks of lice, 
typhoid, and cholera continue to be serious public health 
problems in al-Basrah and throughout the country (department in 
al-Basrah, personal communication). 
  Moreover, sanitation has become a common problem in schools 
that now have 2-3 shifts a day leading to facilitated 
transmission of water-borne diseases amongst the primary age 
school children. Care International reported that in 1954 [year 
as received] it plans to rehabilitate school lavatories. 
  Although the extensive vaccination supply system and the 
cold 
chain broke down completely immediately after the war, 
immunization rates are back well above 80 percent, better than 
pre-war levels in certain areas (UNICEF 1993, personal 
communication). The Ministry of Health has received substantial 
assistance from UNICEF/WHO in maintaining the cold chain and in 
the provision of vaccines for immunization. The mission noted 
adequate stocks of vaccines in Maysan and Irbil Governorates. 
In addition, many mothers when asked, knew about the BCG 
vaccination. 
  Although little is known about the incidence of acute 
respiratory factions (ARI), drugs to treat infections in 
children remain inadequate. The mission noted that several 
cases of ARI in the pediatric wards of Saddam City Hospital in 
Baghdad. These cases were receiving antibiotic treatment but 
physicians complained of shortages, especially during the later 
winter months when ARI is a more frequent occurrence. WHO does 
provide drugs and other medical supplies, but the total amount 
is insufficient to meet the needs of the population. In July to 
March 1993, 780,000 U.S. dollars worth of drugs were provided 
under the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Programme. However, 
drugs to treat chronic diseases, anesthesia to perform basic 
surgical procedures, nitrous oxide for birthing facilities as 
well as antibiotics to control infection after surgery are 
virtually unavailable as reported by several hospitals and the 
minister of health. This was offered as the explanation of why 
hospitals are now functioning at 40-50 percent of their original 
capacity in spite of the reported increase in infectious disease 
and severe malnutrition. 
  Only severely ill cases are now being treated. Even when 
drugs are available, their price on the free market may be 200 
times greater than the government rationed price, thus making 
them virtually unobtainable for the poor. 
  In summary, food insecurity at the household level, 
inadequate water and sanitary system, and the shortage of drugs 
to treat infections are likely to result in more serious 
malnutrition. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Liat Collins] </F>
  [Text] A dramatic increase in rabies cases last year is 
causing concern at the National Veterinary Service, which 
reported 70 cases in 1993, the highest number since 1957. There 
were only 46 reported cases in 1992. 
  "The increase -- which is very worrying -- is because of the 
rising incidents among foxes and jackals," said Chief 
Veterinarian Avner Shimshoni. "It shows that without efforts to 
reduce the jackal and fox population there is no way of stopping 
the spread of rabies." 
  Just 15 of the reported rabies cases last year were in dogs; 
43 were among foxes and jackals and the rest in other animals 
including one sheep, an ass, a cat, and cattle. In 1992, 23 
rabies cases were dogs and 13 were foxes and jackals. 
  During 1993, 117,129 dogs were vaccinated against rabies -- 
an increase of 10 percent over the previous year -- but a 
quarter of the dog population remains without anti-rabies 
inoculation, Shimshoni noted. 
  The rise in the numbers of dog owners vaccinating their pets 
is partly a response to the drop in license and vaccine fees in 
some towns. New regulations in force at the end of 1993 put a 
maximum price dog license at NIS [new Israeli shekels] 37.5 and 
NIS 13.5 for the vaccine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yelena Vasilyevna Zavatskaya, deputy head </F>
physician at the Maritime Kray Center for the Prevention and 
Treatment of AIDS, by Vladimir Isakov; from the "Lunch Hour 
Break" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] AIDS has been called the Bubonic Plague of the 20th 
century. What action is being taken in the Maritime Kray to 
prevent the spread of this disease? Our correspondent, Vladimir 
Isakov, spoke to Yelena Vasilyevna Zavatskaya, deputy head 
physician at the kray Center for the Prevention and Treatment of 
AIDS. [Begin recording] 
  Isakov: Yelena Vasilyeva, I have a question for 
you: When and why was our center established? 
  Zavatskaya: The kray AIDS center was established 
in 1989. It is unusual because, with the exception of Moscow, 
there is no equal to it in Russia. 
  We have identified seven cases of HIV in the Maritime Kray, 
five of these in just the past two years. This is far more than 
in any other Far East region. There is one case each in Magadan 
and Kamchatka Oblasts, and one in Khabarovsk Kray. 
  Isakov: What do you think is the reason? 
  Zavatskaya: The fact that HIV infected people in 
the northern regions have had sexual partners in Vladivostok and 
Nakhodka. However, they do not know their names and surnames, 
and they simply have not shown up here yet. We want people to 
seek medical advice. We have discreet examination, treatment, 
and consulting rooms and a crisis center with a round-the-clock 
crisis telephone line. We will preserve the anonymity of 
patients. We urge people who suspect they may have contracted 
AIDS to call us by telephone on 236311. We have an outpatients' 
clinic where they can be examined by such attending specialists 
as a [termotrenerologist], a gynecologist, a physiotherapist, an 
infectious diseases specialist, and a pediatrician. 
  Isakov: If, for example, someone becomes an HIV 
carrier, how soon should they come to you? 
  Zavatskaya: People with HIV generally go rather a 
long time before they become unwell, but they can still infect 
others through sex. People should simply be aware that this 
disease does not run a course like most other diseases and if 
there is any reason to suspect they may have contracted it, they 
must have themselves checked. 
  Isakov: Is there criminal liability if an 
HIV-infected person knowingly has sex with another person? 
  Zavatskaya: They sign an undertaking not to 
spread the disease, as with any other venereal disease. 
  Isakov: Yelena Vasilyevna, do you have modern 
equipment that can diagnose HIV infection? 
  Zavatskaya: We have a laboratory which can 
diagnose the presence of antibodies in the blood. There is no 
need to be afraid because there are HIV-infected people at the 
center; in fact, I would like to say that, in general, 
HIV-infected people are no cause for general concern. For 
instance, on 1 December I felt bad when I read in the NASH 
VLADIVOSTOK newspaper that here in Maritime Kray, [journalist] 
Marina Sokolova calls them AIDS carriers when the rest of the 
world refers to them as HIV-infected. The whole world is 
battling to protect these people. In principle, it is possible 
for anyone to become infected through sexual contact, yet here 
we call them AIDS carriers. There is no protection for them. 
Young people are committing suicide because it is impossible to 
live with the stigma of this in our society. That is what I 
wanted to stress: There must be protection and there must not be 
such aggression. As things stand, if there is an information 
leak, the carriers do not have a chance to live and work. 
  Isakov: Can you tell us if is any medicine which 
can bolster the immune system? 
  Zavatskaya: There is the world-renowned 
azidothymidine [AZT]. The Russian name for this preparation is 
(kimozit) and if patients need it, they will receive it free of 
charge. 
  Isakov: And finally, what is your wish for our 
listeners? 
  Zavatskaya: I have a big favor to ask. If you 
suffer any change in bodily function, or if something is 
worrying you, please come in. The round-the-clock crisis 
telephone number is 236311, or you can visit our examination, 
treatment, and consulting rooms at 50 Botisenko [Street] between 
0800 and 1800 hours daily and give a blood sample. You do not 
need to use your name. We will test it for HIV and Wassermann 
reaction, and you need not even come back for your results -- we 
can advise you by telephone if you wish. [end recording]

  [Text] An AIDS checkpoint has been opened at the "Psou" 
checkpoint where Russia's land border with Georgia and Abkhazia 
passes. Now together with the Soviet passport with its hammer 
and sickle those entering Russia are required to produce a 
certificate stating that the citizen does not carry the HIV 
infection. If there is no certificate an analysis is made at 
the checkpoint for 5,000 rubles. Otherwise entry to Russia is 
not allowed. According to Nikolay Kochetkov, director of the 
Sochi AIDS prevention center, among 200 citizens checked at the 
checkpoint two have already been found suffering from syphilis, 
as have 20 drug addicts and one person suspected of carrying the 
AIDS virus.

  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 30 Jan -- An outbreak of 
diphtheria, claiming two human lives in December and putting 
over 50 islanders in the hospital, has been localized. In 
January, only 10 Sakhalin residents caught the dangerous 
infection. Enough vaccines and serums have been brought into 
the oblast for the treatment and prevention of diphtheria. To 
combat it, the oblast administration has set up a special 
operational headquarters and has allocated foreign currency for 
the acquisition of medicines. 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the head of the 
health 
administration of the oblast, Aleksandr Moshenskiy, that most 
probably the local internal affairs administration's corrective 
labor institutions were the source of infection; nearly 
one-third of sufferers are located in the labor colonies.

<F P=106> [Correspondent Z. Fedotova report over video, including </F>
interview with Ye.N. Belyayev, chairman of the State Committee 
for Sanitation and Epidemiological Supervision (Sanepidnadzor); 
from the "Utro" program -- place and date not given; recorded] 
  [Text] Fedotova: Yevgeniy Nikolayevich, even 
last year the number of cases of diphtheria infection increased 
to such an extent in the country that medical officials 
repeatedly said that an epidemic is at hand. Is this true? 
  Belyayev: Yes, it is. In fact, as of today we 
have registered more than 15,000 cases of diphtheria -- 4,500 of 
them are children, and 388 people have already died, including 
79 children. So we must talk about the threat of an epidemic. 
[video cuts to show hospital, children being immunized] 
  Fedotova: Yevgeniy Belyayev considers that 
science has provided a reliable substance to combat diphtheria. 
The disease can be reduced to just a few odd cases while the 
threat of an epidemic can be completely eliminated if 95 percent 
of children and 80 percent of the entire population of the 
country undergo a proper series of vaccinations. 
  However, only about 72.6 percent of children are being 
vaccinated during their first year, and 81.9 percent by the age 
of three. What is the reason for these low figures? Yevgeniy 
Belyayev thinks there are several. Here are some of them: An 
unjustifiably broad spectrum of conditions counterposing medical 
evidence in the country's present treatment facilities. In fact 
there are eight of them. In the United States there are only 
two -- a high fever or some immune deficiency. These are the 
only grounds excusing American children from compulsory 
inoculation. Another problem is that the annual schedules for 
vaccinations of the population have been altered four times in 
the past 12 years and this has given rise to shortcomings in the 
organization and implementation of the vaccination campaign. 
[video again shows Fedotova talking to Belyayev] 
  And what about those strange parents who prevent their 
children from being vaccinated for various reasons. It seems 
that this is the way people are -- they wait until it is too 
late. As a matter of fact, Yevgeniy Belyayev unequivocally 
challenged one of the claims made by recalcitrant parents that 
domestic vaccines are of poor quality. He said our preparations 
correspond to the requirements of world standards; they have 
been tested and recognized and will help stop the epidemic. 
  Belyayev: Together with scientists and officials 
of the Ministry of Health and other interested departments we 
developed a federal program of preventive vaccinations last 
year. It was approved by the government and it envisages 
considerable allocations of funds. We adopted a decision to 
inoculate the entire population during 1994-95. The state 
recognizes its responsibility to defend you from diphtheria. 
You too should accept the responsibility for immunizing your 
children. Have them vaccinated this year. This will prevent 
you from getting ill. Without detailed, conscientious, 
precise, and well-organized work in every polyclinic, every 
school, and every adult outpatients clinic we will not solve the 
problem. All children's immunization charts and health records 
need to be checked. 
  I would also like to appeal to the producers. We have two 
enterprises turning out the vaccines. Do everything to ensure 
that we have a sufficient quantity of vaccine this year. You 
can do this. I must also appeal to workers of the State 
Sanitation and Epidemiological Service. Do not limit yourselves 
to helping in organizing this work. To help is your sacred 
task. But you, epidemiological physicians, have been invested 
with extensive rights. You must perform the function of 
supervision. You must demand maximum compliance. 
  Fedotova: Another thought was expressed during 
our conversation. 
  Belyayev: Recently our service has adopted a 
strict policy of strengthening supervisory functions and many 
are unhappy about this. They do not like it. Attempts are again 
being made to make our service subservient to some other 
department, and to belittle its role in society. However this 
process is irreversible everywhere in the world. It is a state 
service, and that is how it ought to be. Efforts to make it part 
of some department are an attempt to curry favor with the shadow 
economy and shady people engaged in small business, and I think 
that in this case we should take a firm stand.

  [Text] A dangeorus situation is developing in St. 
Petersburg as regards the number of cases of diphtheria. Last 
year the disease proved fatal for 51 St. Petersburgers -- none 
of the dead had been innoculated -- including six children. 
  Commenting on the lamentable statistics for infectious 
diseases, experts point to the steady rise in such diseases as 
tuberculosis, syphilis, and gonorrhea. Deaths from dysentery 
also rose: Last year 172 St. Petersburgers died. The number of 
cases of viral hepatitis was up 80 percent, with the number of 
St. Petersburgers who died from the disease doubling last year. 
  Experts so far see no grounds for an improvement in the 
epidemiological situation in St. Petersburg although special 
programs to combat the most widespread diseases are being 
formulated and implemented at federal and municipal levels.

  [Text] Samara -- A diphtheria outbreak has been noted in 
Samara Oblast. In just under two months 21 instances of people 
falling ill with this dangerous disease have been identified. A 
whole family of five including two children aged four and seven 
has become infected in Novokuybyshevsk. For the seven-year-old 
child, who had not been inoculated against diphtheria, the 
disease proved fatal. A three-year-old child has also died in a 
family of down-and-outs who came to Samara from Krasnodar and 
has been living at the railroad station.

  [Text] Announcer: Yelena Bonner today demanded 
that Vil Mirzoyanov, the chemical expert, should have an open 
trial. Bonner's view is that the legal proceedings violate the 
legal rules, which means that human rights continue to be a 
hollow concept in Russia. 
  The problem raised by Mirzoyanov is becoming public 
knowledge 
and more details are now emerging. Aleksey Kondulukov reports: 
  Kondulukov: The chemical scandal in Russia is 
assuming ever broader dimensions. Vil Mirzoyanov, the chemical 
expert who disclosed to the public that new types of chemical 
weapons are under development and undergoing testing is already 
under lock and key in the Matrosskaya Tishina prison. The 
Moscow City Court has already held its first session devoted to 
this case. There have already been first appeals and first 
public petitions to the president. 
  Now yet another letter to Yeltsin has emerged, this time 
from 
Uglev, another chemical expert who is also threatened with 
arrest. Uglev says that Russia is not currently equipped to 
destroy the stockpiles of chemical weapons in our country, and 
this is the reason why these weapons are being destroyed by the 
most primitive of means, without any regard to observing 
ecological norms. Uglev says that chemical weapons are being 
destroyed at the Shikhany range in Saratov Oblast as though they 
are ordinary ammunition. 
  Uglev: "In individual cases it is poured directly 
into the ground. That is all, that is what it is all about. Or 
they explode shells filled with... [pauses] with chemical 
substances." 
  Announcer: The soil, the subsoil and the 
atmosphere are becoming contaminated. The incidence of cancer 
among the population living nearby has increased. Uglev's view 
is that this is a direct consequence of ecological 
infringements, and he should know, because he himself 
participated in the development of chemical weapons, and his 
knowledge of their disabling factors is second to none. 
  In his letter to the president, Uglev stated that if the 
country's leadership fails to focus attention on these problems, 
he will, on 4 February, make public the formula of a new type of 
chemical weapon. The ultimatum was effective, and Uglev 
recently met with Baturin, the president's national security 
aide. Uglev says that the authorities have at long last become 
interested in this subject matter. 
  Uglev: "It seems there will be no sensation on 4 
February, because there is a definite accord with the 
presidential aide and, when all is said and done, I think that 
the main aim has been reached. I am satisfied, to a 
considerable extent, although the Mirzoyanov case has so far 
remained deadlocked, generally speaking. 
  I said to Mr. Baturin literally what follows: If the 
president issued orders to fire on the White House, there is no 
need to fire on the Moscow City Court -- it is sufficient, as it 
were, to articulate your point of view to the judges." 
  Announcer: Whatever happens, the court's next 
session in the Mirzoyanov's case is tomorrow, and tomorrow we 
will know for sure how events have unfolded. [Video shows

<F P=106> [Article by Nadezhda Nadezhdina: "To Neither Live Nor Die </F>
Like Others Do; What Ails Our Society, and Is There Hope for a 
Cure?"; first paragraph is boldface TRUD introduction] 
  [Text] In 1959, immediately after graduating from 
Moscow Medical Institute, Vladmiir Ivanovich Mishugin left for 
Sakhalin on assignment. He was sent, and he went. For 5 years he 
worked there on the remote island in a maternity home. He 
returned to Moscow, headed a department, and became deputy chief 
and later chief physician of the hospital. He completed 
international courses of the World Health Organization. For 13 
years now he has been the chief physician of Moscow's Hospital 
No. 52. He has seen a great deal during these years, knows a 
great deal, and has thought over a great deal. He has something 
to say. 
  What is a hospital? A place where they operate, treat, and 
care for patients and help them recover their strength. But I 
would put it more briefly: A hospital is a center of pain and 
sorrow. That is why a physician who bends over a patient in the 
operating room, during resuscitation, or simply in a ward 
intensely catches his breathing and pulse and sees how suffering 
is replaced by hope in his eyes. I once thought that in the 
physician's consciousness there was no room just then for the 
thoughts that would scare, sadden, or gladden him beyond the 
hospital walls and that our profession demands such 
concentration and such self-denial. But now this life outside 
the hospital digs into the wards every hour of every day. And 
sometimes you do not know what you must save a patient from: 
from the hypertension crisis that brought him here or from what 
awaits him beyond the hospital walls. 
  The rule of thumb is that the health of the masses is the 
property of the country. So why then aren't we trying to augment 
this property? True, this is a difficult transitional time. But 
each individual's life is unique. People are eating poorly. The 
demand for bread and potatoes is growing. Vegetables, fruits, 
and juices are far from available to everyone. Drugs are 
incredibly expensive. One of my doctor friends stopped seeing a 
patient because the patient could not afford the pills: "He had 
better find a way to buy them because burials are even more 
expensive." A bitter joke! 
  And in addition, life has twisted around so that many have 
stopped seeing physicians. The reasons are many. Here are the 
statistics: A polyclinic is designed for 20,000 visits each year 
and has 10 sections and 10 therapists. The results are tallied: 
16,000 to 18,000 visits maximum. This means that they are forced 
to consolidate sections and reduce the number of physicians. As 
a result, the medical service of the microrayon becomes 
increasingly worse. 
  It is a bitter paradox: the number of polyclinic visits is 
decreasing while the number of emergency calls is increasing. We 
feel it ourselves: There is almost no systematic 
hospitalization. Before, they would hospitalize you with chronic 
appendicitis. For a a cold, you would receive anti-inflammatory 
treatment. In a week or two a person was back on his feet. New 
they transport you with a ruptured appendix or else with 
peritonitis. But by then there is a threat to life. Patients 
arrive in very grave condition, the ambulance brings in 50 or 
more persons each day, and operating rooms work day and night 
because often it is already too late for anything besides a 
scalpel to help. 
  Our surgeons are excellent. But after an operation, patients 
need care. Otherwise, even a person whose operation was 
successful may be lost. And again the winds of the disorder of 
life blow into our wards. There is essentially no one to care 
for patients. Nurses earn 32,000 and nurse's aides earn 10,500, 
which is below the minimum pension. Who will take the job? 
Before, young women graduated from medical school and were sent 
to work in hospitals or polyclinics. Now, they put their 
diplomas in some remote drawer, or else they seek work in 
commercial situations. 
  There are no nurse's aides. There are 44 positions in the 
admissions department, and only 17 are filled. Before, 
moonlighting students from the medical higher educational 
institutions filled them and entered hospital life nevertheless. 
Today there are none: blood, pain, moans....It is better to 
unload the car at night to earn a few "pieces" in addition to 
one's stipend than to wheel patients from floor to floor and 
help the helpless... 
  And in the departments? Take vascular neurology. Impairments 
in the brain's blood circulation and strokes. Everyone is 
bedridden. They do not raise their hands, their legs are 
paralyzed, and their speech is unintelligible. They cannot feed 
themselves or perform self-care. A few are visited by relatives 
often. But how many there are who go without visitors for a 
month. The department is scheduled to have 26 nurses and 18 
nurse's aides; however, 14 nurses and 2 nurse's aides work 
there. And the departments has not 70 patients as planned, but 
87. I will not take the blame. Our dear nurses work selflessly. 
But can they really provide real care. One wipes the floor, 
throws down the rag, quickly washes her hands, and goes to give 
an injection. Parishioners have come from the church. They have 
been called to be sick nurses. All traces of them have been 
wiped out after only a couple of weeks. The work is very hard. 
That is why a nurse cannot be found. And each combines at least 
two positions. It is simply impossible to live on one nurse's 
salary. 
  Nearly 40 percent of our patients are elderly. They are the 
worst of all. Well, we bring them in from an acute situation, 
and every one of them has a heap of chronic illnesses. Their 
legs do not work, and their pressure is very unsteady. They are 
thin and weak. You look at just what is holding a soul inside 
it. And we cannot leave them in the hospital longer. What we 
have is a conveyer. The ambulance keeps on bringing them. The 
next one needs the cot. And it breaks your heart to sign a 
patient out. Just how will he get by this way at home? 
  Not long ago they brought in an old man directly from the 
polyclinic. He was suffering from acute hypertension. He lay in 
the ward, and we treated and fed him. And once he asked a nurse 
to telephone his daughter. Our Verochka became interested and 
asked, "And do you live with your daughter?" "Together, 
together," he said, "and I hand over my pension. She is all 
alone. Her husband left, and she has two children. Is she really 
in the mood for me? We called the apartment and only had time to 
say "This is the hospital calling" before they hung up at the 
other end of the line. And this happened several times. The old 
man had to be signed out. He was recovering. No one came for 
him. What was there to do? They took a car and drove him home. 
It was locked. The neighbors said, "The little children are in 
kindergarten 5 days each week, and the mother herself gets home 
late." They drove him home the next evening, and again it was 
locked. It ate the old man's heart out. His face went blank, and 
he whispered under his breath, "You see, nobody needs me..." And 
what were we to do? The daughter had to be found through the 
police. 
  You start to think, and your heart breaks. Whom do you feel 
sorry for? I understand how it is for the young woman. She 
worked somewhere as a recordkeeper at a factory. She earned 
20,000 and assistance for her children. One time the old man 
told us that nearly every morning she took work as a 
deliveryperson. Later, she moonlighted as a helper in a store to 
have a kopeck for herself. After all, children must be clothed, 
provided with shoes, and fed. She would return home exhausted 
and would again wash, cook, and scrub the floors. And she is 
still young and wants some kind of life...But to abandon her 
father? 
  Once I recall his worried eyes, I lose all sympathy for the 
young woman...In the hospital I grew attached to our sweet old 
man and felt sorry for him. But would they take him home to his 
daughter. His pressure was brought down, but he could barely 
walk, his joints ached, and he had an old man's cough. No one 
would pour him a glass of tea.... 
  I certainly would not have mentioned this case had it been 
the only one. In nearly every department there lie old men who 
were ready to be discharged long ago. But we could not. You just 
don't say "leave". And their relatives are in no hurry to come 
for them. Sometimes it is worse. We drive them home. They open 
the door, look out, and shout, "Why did you bring him here? He 
can hardly walk. You take care of him. It's your duty...." And 
sometimes enterprising people assume guardianship over an 
elderly person. He transfers his privatized apartment over to 
them according to all the rules, and at his very first sign of 
indisposition, they send their "ward" off to the hospital. They 
sell the apartment. You can whistle for them in a field....And 
where is he to go? To the old folks' home? 
  We need hospitals with nursing care. Let them be hospitals 
that charge. Every elderly man and elderly woman has some kind 
of pension. They can lie calmly, get better, and recover their 
strength as much as possible. And they can leave when then are 
able to care for themselves. We have been talking about this. 
But what's this about nursing care hospitals, they wonder, when 
there are not enough places for patients with acute illnesses? 
It will happen. We will wait until things in the economy take a 
turn for the better. We were promised this first in 92, then in 
93, and now in 95. This means that today's elderly have no 
possibility of seeing anything better. What hasn't befallen 
their fate: the camps, the war, the 5-year-plans, and the shock 
Siberian construction jobs. Can concern for them be put off 
until "after stabilization"? 
  The most terrifying thing is that your close relatives 
refuse 
to bury you. As far as I remember, this never happened before. 
Perhaps the man is some homeless vagrant. It was impossible to 
find his relatives, so the hospital had to bury him. And then? 
The son comes, takes the death certificate, and fills out an 
application: Because of financial circumstances, I am unable to 
bury my relative...I request....Upon my word, this past year it 
has ceased to amaze us. 
  Yes, funerals today are incredibly expensive, and the grants 
that the government gives do not even cover one-third of the 
cost. But to not send your father, wife, or son on their final 
journey? To not bend over them, not throw a handful of earth 
into a fresh grave. How can one live afterward? God, what is 
happening to us? 
  We gather in the hospital's staff room in a rare free moment 
and think. Of course, people's lives are hard. In some families 
they live from pay to pay, and they don't have enough bread. But 
really, was it easy during the war? During the evacuation a 
mother was ready to give her last skirt for milk for her little 
children. And she woke up and went to bed with deathly fear for 
her husband, who was fighting somewhere near the Dnepr. But 
there was never such bitterness. They helped one another how 
they could. They took care of the little children, and they took 
pity on the old people. The common misfortune united them. In 
the name of one common great purpose -- victory -- they were 
ready to endure. But today? 
  There are rich as well as poor. One child brings a Snickers 
and kiwi to school, while another mother can only put a piece of 
bread into the child's bag....No, I am not for poverty-ridden 
socialist equality. Let the rich be. They create jobs and 
sustain the public coffers with their taxes. Only poverty must 
not be below what we now call the "subsistence minimum." And how 
much lower can it go if it is already the "minimum"? And nearly 
every fourth family among us lives that way. Is this not the 
reason for the bitterness? 
  Many of those who before believed in the coming communism 
have now been drawn to the church. But even religion will not 
bring calm to society. The discussions of the politicians -- the 
democrats, the reds, the browns, the market proponents, the 
market opponents -- are loud. In another family, instead of 
putting the children to bed on time, they argue about Gaydar and 
Yeltsin until they are hoarse. Excess politization, like a 
disease, poisons the consciousness. Simple human values -- 
compassion, common experience, concern for the elderly and 
children, loyalty to one's wife or husband -- have lost their 
worth. Where are the quiet family joys when everyone used to 
gather in the evening, albeit at a meager table, but where 
everyone was happy because despite all the trouble in the world, 
they still had undying love, warmth, and the comfort of home? We 
physicians may understand more clearly than others that it is 
not only the physical but also the moral health of the people 
that is in danger. Only, where are the drugs for this malady?

released by the National Disease Prevention Centre, more and 
more people have influenza in Lithuania. 
  The researh of the Infectious Diseases Centre showed that 
the 
virus A of the influenza has been spread in Lithuania. The 
greatest number of those having flu is in Klaipeda, although the 
situation has been stabilized this week. In Vilnius the number 
of those who have flu increased by 3.6 times this week. 
  In Kaunas the number of flu patients has increased by three 
times, in Siauliai -- by 4.5 times, in Panevezys -- by 1.5 
times. The number of flu patients also increases in 
Marijampole, Kupiskis, Plunge. 
  According to doctors, the flu epidemic is not so active as 
it 
was last year and there have not been serious complications 
registered so far.

  [Text] Yaroslav Novytskyy, a Lvov scientist, has created a 
preparation based upon celandine [Latin: Chelidonium majus] -- a 
biennial herb of the poppy family -- for the treatment of cancer 
and AIDS. The scientist first used it to treat his brother, who 
had cancer, and cured him. Unable to implement his plans in his

he continued his research. It proved a success: On the basis 
of celandine, an even more effective medicinal preparation, 
Ukrayinian, was obtained. 
  The scientist's invention has been patented in many

of the world. Major pharmaceutical firms and companies are 
offering the inventor a lot of money for the patent to produce 
this preparation, but he is in no hurry. Last year, Ukrayinian 
was successfully tested at the Kiev Medical Institute.

  [Text] Four cases of AIDS carriers were discovered in 
January. An artiste from Romania, a house assistant from 
Zimbabwe and two Cypriot men both aged 32 made up the four. 
Between October 1986 and to date, 159 cases have been spotted 
affecting 88 Cypriots and 71 foreigners. Of the 88 Cypriots, 77 
are men and 11 women.

  [Text] Four people, a worker from Africa and three 
Cypriots, were identified HIV-positive in February, an official 
announcement said Wednesday. 
  The two infected Cypriots are both 32 years old and the 
third 
is 20. All of them contacted the virus from sexual intercourse 
with an AIDS carrier most likely outside Cyprus, probably Greece 
or Thailand, the announcement added. 
  Since October 1986, 163 people - 91 Cypriots and 72 
foreigners - were infected by the deadly disease. Of the 91 
Cypriots, 80 of them are men. 
  Seventy-seven of the total number of Cypriot carriers live 
on 
the island while 14 live abroad. 
  So far 16 Cypriots suffering from AIDS have died, while two 
other carriers died from other causes. 
  The age group 20-29 concentrated 42 of the 91 Cypriots 
carrying AIDS. The second high-risk group is between 30 and 39 
which concentrated 29 cases. 
  The most common way (76 percent) of contacting the disease 
is 
through sexual intercourse, the announcement said.

  [Text] Microsystems engineers at the Munich-based 
Fraunhofer Institute of Solid-State Chemistry, working with 
microbiologists from the University of Regensburg, have 
developed a new HIV test in which a biosensor detects traces of 
the AIDS virus in blood samples. The Fraunhofer Society (FhG) 
has recently announced that the system, which works 
automatically, is ideal for use in mobile units and large test 
batches and is cheaper and faster than conventional detection 
methods. 
  The new process is based on the same test principle as 
previous methods, exploiting the antigen-antibody reaction. 
When a human being becomes infected with the HIV, which 
triggers the lethal immune-deficiency disease, AIDS, his or her 
immune system produces specific antibodies to proteins on the 
surface of the pathogen. These proteins are termed antigens. If 
a blood sample is exposed to artificially produced antigens, any 
AIDS antibodies present in the blood will fasten onto them. In 
the conventional enzyme immune test, which takes several hours, 
this bond triggers a change of color. 
  The FhG reports that the new system detects the 
antigen-antibody reaction in only 10 minutes. An injection 
valve feeds the blood sample into a stream of liquid flowing 
through a measuring chamber with a sensitive piezoelectric 
oscillator. An electronic alternating field causes these thin, 
pure quartz platelets, of the type used, for instance, in 
watches and modern digital scales, to vibrate. If anything is 
deposited on the quartz, the oscillation frequency changes, the 
change being recorded by the oscillator and the frequency 
counter. 
  The researchers used gold, to which proteins adhere well, to 
coat the quartz platelets with AIDS virus antigens. As soon as 
HIV antibodies fasten onto the sensor, its mass increases, as 
does its oscillation frequency. It is reported that test 
batches of a thousand samples each can be tested automatically 
with this process. If the AIDS antibody is discovered in one of 
the samples, the apparatus must be cleaned or the piezoelectric 
oscillator changed. The society's report states that all 
previous tests showed a marked difference in response to 
positive and antibody-free serum samples. As the new test is 
basically an offshoot of the conventional detection process, the 
researchers assume that it is equally accurate.

  [Text] The new Max Planck Institute of the Biology of 
Infection is due to begin work in the eastern part of Berlin at 
the beginning of 1994 and to move into new premises close to the 
Charite in 1998 at the latest. The establishment of this 
institute is regarded as a rare scientific opportunity to devote 
appropriate attention to this area, which is of importance in 
terms of both basic research and medical practice. 
  A third of all fatalities in the world can be traced to 
diseases caused by microbial pathogens. One and a half billion 
people -- primarily in the third world, suffer from the 19 
infectious diseases (excluding AIDS), for which American doctors 
consider new vaccines must be developed as a matter of priority. 
  The methods used in molecular and cytobiology, immunology, 
epidemiology, and structural chemistry now make it possible to 
arrive at a better understanding of the biology of the infection 
process and, consequently, at new approaches to the prevention 
and treatment of infectious diseases. Research into the biology 
of infection has thus increased considerably worldwide, 
although, apart from exceptions such as virus-dependent 
infectious diseases, it has not yet attained an internationally 
competitive level in Germany. 
  With the founding of a Max Planck Institute of the Biology 
of 
Infection to carry out multidisciplinary research the MPG [Max 
Planck Society] has taken a decisive step toward establishing 
this field in the Federal Republic of Germany. 
  By the time the institute is complete, it will comprise four 
departments: 
  -- Immunology (headed by Professor Stefan E.A. Kaufmann), 
which will primarily study the interactions between immune 
systems and microbial pathogens, with particular reference to 
defensive and pathogenic mechanisms; 
  -- Molecular Genetics, which will work on the molecular 
basis 
of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and identify and 
analyze the factors responsible for virulence; 
  -- Cytobiology, which will focus primarily on the invasion 
of 
host cells by microbes and on topics relating to intracellular 
proliferation and cell-to-cell spreading. Methods provided by 
cytobiology, electron microscopy, and biochemistry will be used 
to study communication between pathogen and host cell; 
  -- Epidemiology, which will set out to identify virulence 
and 
resistance characteristics relevant to the spread of infectious 
diseases and to study microecosystems involved in infectious 
diseases. 
  The plan from the outset is to include clinical research as 
an integral part of the institute's overall approach and to 
recruit clinicians specializing in infectious diseases to work 
with research teams. Programs of research into infectious 
diseases in developing countries will also be drawn up and 
undertaken either in collaboration with the research 
laboratories already established in the countries concerned or 
by setting up field stations there. It is also planned to 
extend the institute's scientific range by establishing 
independent teams of young scientists to work on topics that 
complement the research undertaken in the institute's own 
departments.

  [Text] The AIDS virus destroys the immune system upon 
infection and has no incubation period, according to new 
evidence presented at Greece's Fifth National AIDS Convention 
yesterday. 
  "During the convention it will be proved that the virus has 
no dormant period," said epidemiologist Dr. A. Khatzakis 
yesterday. 
  Dermatologist Ioannis Stratigos said doctors had thought the 
disease had an incubation period because "HIV positive people 
maintain relatively good health for six to 10 years." 
  But while the medical community has been struggling to 
understand the virus, residents of a Piraievs suburb are showing 
less compassion over a hostel for the HIV-positive. 
  "We fear for our children's health," said one hostel 
neighbour, while another said the AIDS victims should be moved 
out of the city. 
  "We just want to live with dignity and find a job," said 
AIDS-affected Andonis. But not all neighbours are negative. 
"These kids are my friends," said Nikolaos Roumeliotis who 
lives right next door.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- France will host a 
17-nation AIDS summit in Paris in November because the AIDS 
epidemic is now too serious to leave to medical experts alone, 
an emissary for the French health minister said Tuesday [8 
March] in Tokyo. 
  Jean Francois Girard, director general of health in the 
French Ministry of Social Affairs, Health and City, told a news 
conference that the one-day summit will bring together heads of 
at least 17 nations to consider ways to fight the AIDS epidemic 
on a global level. 
  "Till now, health problems have been treated by doctors, but 
AIDS is too serious to be treated only by doctors," Girard said. 
  "For the first time in the history of the world, heads of 
government will be considering a health problem. It will be a 
historic turning point." 
  Girard visited the Health and Welfare Ministry on Monday and 
the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday to explain the goals and solicit 
participation. 
  He said the 17 countries to be invited include those whose 
contribution to the international fight against AIDS is the 
greatest. Among them are Australia, Canada, France, Japan, 
Russia, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. 
  He said United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
has indicated he would like to attend. 
  Girard said several international organizations, including 
the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. Education, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the U.N. 
Children's Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. Fund for Population 
Activities (UNFPA) and the World Bank will have input into 
planning the summit agenda. 
  He said experts in many other AIDS-affected countries who 
are 
not invited will be consulted at the preparatory stage. 
  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will chair the 
summit, 
for which no final date has been set. 
  The gathering was originally scheduled for June, but Girard 
said it was postponed because many heads of state could not come 
in June and because Japan will host an international meeting of 
AIDS experts, including doctors, researchers, and AIDS 
sufferers, in Yokohama in August. 
  About 10,000 people from more than 140 countries, including 
some 1,000 AIDS patients and carriers of the AIDS-causing human 
immunodeficiency virus, are expected to attend the Yokohama 
meeting. 
  Girard said the Paris AIDS summit will be able to capitalize 
on decisions made at the Yokohama conference.

  [Text] Zagreb, Feb 2 (AFP) -- More than half the medicine 
donated to the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the former 
Yugoslavia is unusable, the WHO said in a statement here 
Wednesday [2 February]. 
  Around 15 percent of donated medicines had passed their 
deadline for use or were otherwise unusable, and 30 percent were 
totally inappropriate for the needs of the population, the WHO 
said. 
  Sorting out what medicines could be used had cost WHO and 
charity organisations precious time. Carrying the useless 
medicines had filled up valuable cargo space in stores, on 
aircraft and lorries, the WHO added. 
  Only medicines which still had more than a year to run to 
their expiry date and which are included in the WHO list of 
essential drugs should be sent, it said.

  In the past week, 6,576 cases of infectious diseases were 
registered in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Enterocolitis makes up the 
majority of cases, followed by influenza and infectious 
hepatitis. Medical equipment and expert medical teams are most 
needed in the areas where the aggressor continues to attack 
fiercely. In accordance with the normalization of the 
situation, preparations have begun for the return of displaced 
persons within the country, and of those from other countries. 
The number of Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees has climbed to 
1,260,088. Of these, 727,234 refugees have been registered in 
areas under the control of the legitimate authorities. The 
majority of our refugees are in Germany, Croatia, Austria, 
Switzerland, and in other countries.

<F P=106> ["(aha)"-signed report: "The Discovery of Czech Scientists </F>
May Help Cure AIDS"] 
  [Text] Prague -- The discovery of a new group of chemical 
substances by scientists from the Department of Chemistry and 
Biochemistry of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in the 
mid-1980's can essentially affect the development of medical 
drugs against AIDS. The new drugs based on the substance 
developed by the Czech scientists affects diseases caused by the 
so-called DNA viruses, or retroviruses [retroviry] that appear 
in connection with immune deficiency, particularly in AIDS 
patients and in patients that have undergone tissue transplants. 
  "The new preparation should solve, for example, the problem 
of shingles (an eye disease causing blindness), hepatitis, and 
even AIDS. It has an effect on viruses for which medical 
science has no drugs," Antonin Holy from the Academy of Sciences 
said. Patients would take the drug once a week, or at longer 
intervals. 
  The U.S. firm Gilead Sciences from California has obtained a 
license for utilizing the discovery of the Czech scientists and 
is attempting to manufacture the drug. In the United States, 
where the preparation is being tested on AIDS, experts say that 
it really affects the condition of people who suffer from 
full-blown AIDS. Clinical tests of all the preparations are not 
yet completed.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout report: "We Are Under the </F>
Threat of Bacteriological Weapons!"] 
  [Text] According to findings by CESKY DENIK reporters, a 
very dangerous family of bacteriological and virological weapons 
is secretly stored on the Czech Republic's territory. Our 
country is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, which this 
obliges us not to allow our army to develop bacteriological or 
virological weapons, use them, or store them without 
international approval. 
  Within the framework of the former Warsaw Pact, the then 
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic was authorized to develop 
bacteriological weapons. A very secret site was designated for 
this purpose in the Military Research Institute near Techonin in 
the Orlicke Hory mountains. The Research Institute operated 
within the framework of the Military Medical Academy in Hradec 
Kralove. Scientists from other Warsaw Pact countries 
participated in the development and testing of these very 
dangerous and inhumane weapons. They were mostly from the former 
Soviet Union -- from a Leningrad institute -- Bulgarians, and 
others. CESKY DENIK reporters have found out that the species 
of the bacteria and viruses developed in Techonin had been 
stored in various places in the Czech Republic until recently. 
On other, unknown places, they may still be stored. This is not 
only a violation of the Czech Republic's international 
obligations, but also a criminal act -- at the very least -- of 
posing a public threat with unpredictable consequences. 
  It is very likely that in the Military Research Institute in 
Technonin species of biological weapons are still being stored, 
or have been destroyed only very recently. They are for 
example, a culture of cholera, the plague, smallpox, tularemia, 
meningitis, and the rare psittacosis.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout report: "A Crime Endangering </F>
Central Europe!"] 
  [Text] One of the places where, until recently, our army 
concealed very dangerous bacteriological and virological weapons 
was the Central Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice! 
  CESKY DENIK reporters have discovered that strains for 
bacteriological weapons were stored, without expert supervision 
and the necessary caution, in a laboratory leased to a private 
company on the grounds of the Central Military Hospital in 
Stresovice. They were developed on the basis of a former Warsaw 
Pact treaty in a research institute in Techonin in East Bohemia. 
The laboratory, with its containers full of cultures for 
dangerous infectious germs prepared for combat use, was leased 
to the private Klinlab company. According to the information 
available, Deputy Defense Minister Engineer Miroslav Kalousek 
was involved in establishing this company and in leasing part of 
the Central Military Hospital, including the facility used by 
this company. The Defense Ministry also purchased expensive 
laboratory equipment for the Klinlab company. The whole project 
was described as top secret and of special significance. 
  Some of the containers, in which various kinds of bacteria 
for weapons "cultivated" by Czechoslovak military experts were 
stored, were sold into private hands, that is, to the Klinlab 
company. 
  Bacteriological and viral weapons are among the most 
insidious and dangerous. International agreements commit the 
Czech Republic to preventing their use, development, and 
storage. It is apparent from the findings of the CESKY DENIK 
reporters that the cultures for the bacteriological weapons were 
stored in the Central Military Hospital with the knowledge of 
some of our most senior military representatives.

<F P=106> ["(lek)"-signed report: "The Military Institute Did Not </F>
Develop Biological Weapons, Says Propper"] 
  [Text] Hradec Kralove -- The former Military Research 
Institute in Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains (now the J.E. 
Purkyne Military Medical Academy Institute of Immunology and 
Microbiology) did not develop in the past -- nor is it doing so 
at present -- bacteriological weapons. This statement was made 
yesterday by Petr Propper, the institute's former director. 
"The institute dealt exclusively with defense-related 
research," he said. 
  Propper described as false the claim in CESKY DENIK that 
dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses, in whose development 
the Techonin-based research institute was involved, are stored 
in various locations in the Czech Republic. 
  According to Josef Fusek, the rector of the Military Medical 
Academy in Hradec Kralove, no bacterial or viral strains with 
transmuted immunological properties were ever developed at the 
institute. Fusek also denied that cholera, plague, smallpox, 
meningitis, or psittacosis germs would have been stored in the 
institute's laboratory. According to him, the research 
concerned other infectious diseases, for example, tularaemia. 
  A commission of experts visited the Techonin institute last 
week -- on the order of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys -- where 
they carried out an inspection and destroyed the cultures that 
will no longer be used for current research, said Fusek. 
  According to staff from the Charles University Faculty of 
Medicine Institute of Microbiology, strains of all the existing 
bacteria and viruses -- including cholera, plague, smallpox, and 
other diseases -- are stored in a number of microbiological 
laboratories. The way they store and dispose of them is, of 
course, subject to the regulations of the World Health 
Organization, which rules out any threat to the population. 
  The Defense Ministry will not, according to its Press 
Department, respond to the report in CESKY DENIK.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes commentary: "Illegal Bacteria"] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl enriched the 
world by the knowledge of the appearance of nuclear death. The 
beginning of the nuclear age was announced by an act of war in 
the war that the United States neither began nor provoked. It 
took place at the time when the consequences were not known. 
The Chernobyl accident took place at the time when the 
consequences were known. Nevertheless, our subservient state 
leadership did practically nothing to protect the society 
against the aftermath of this accident. The crime of public 
endangerment, which then took place, has not been punished. 
  A journalist must not swallow any bait, nor can he miss any 
alarming news. The rumors about SS-20 missiles "forgotten" by 
the occupational power [on Czech territory] are among the things 
that simply cannot be missed. That is true despite the fact 
that one must know how to use a flare, or a warhead, and an 
explosion accidentally triggered by a layman is less likely than 
by an incompetent manipulation with a hand grenade. 
  The situation was worse when unverifiable rumors referred to 
a warhead with a chemical warfare agent. It was just the more 
"poignant" as both the Soviets and Czechoslovakia once promised 
that they would not keep such warfare agents. 
  Moreover, the treaties in which the USSR and former 
Czechoslovakia vouch that they will not use bacteriological or 
virological weapons would make a respectable library. It is not 
only that they promised not to use the weapons -- they actually 
promised not to have them. 
  Of course, some disease cultures, bacteria, and viruses are 
stored and cultivated for scientific reasons, even in the 
civilian sector. There are, however, long series of treaties 
and agreements that specify where and how. Under no 
circumstances, however, at a single location or even a single 
country. If they have, for instance, smallpox in Stockholm, 
then they do not have typhoid, which in turn is, let us say, in 
Milan. These treaties and agreements are also binding for the 
Czech Republic. 
  Nevertheless, the cultures, and in a form ready for combat 
use, have been and are here. In our army, completing its 
transformation and under the leadership of a Christian minister, 
who should know something about it? Our top brass, as is well 
known, are founding businesses, consortia, etc. You will find a 
small civilian business under the name of Klinlab also in the 
Central Military Hospital building. Similar cultures were 
brought there from Techonin in eastern Bohemia, where they were 
cultivated for the Warsaw Pact. They are stored in the Central 
Military Hospital contrary to all the aforementioned 
documentation. It is simply a commonplace company, equipped, 
however, at the expense of the Army, i.e. at the expense of the 
ordinary taxpayer. All this with the knowledge of the reformed 
General Nekvasil. Even his economic deputy, Kalousek, knew 
about it, for he approved the purchase of the equipment for the 
Klinlab company, which was certainly not cheap. 
  As we have managed to ascertain, the serum banks stored in 
the Military Hospital building contain gel ready for immediate 
use. Hence, a catastrophe can be set off by trickling out small 
pox, bubonic plague, or psitacosis etc., in the subway for 
instance. 
  An unintentional release could threaten Prague with, at 
least, the fate of Sverdlovsk (it is now called Ekaterinburg 
again), where a bacteriological warfare agent was released into 
the ventilation system of the local "pharmaceuticals factory" 
and, subsequently, mysterious epidemics broke out in the city. 
An unknown epidemic pneumonia was the most common cause of 
death. 
  In the Czech Army, the bacteriological and virological death 
received the mark PTZD [prisne tajne, zvlastni dulezitost] -- 
top secret, privileged information. The Central Military 
Hospital in Prague, in the building of which the Klinlab is 
located, is a military zone, where the police has no business. 
At the same time, it is also accessible to hospital visitors on 
the weekends, and, of course, to outpatients. This means that 
it is generally accessible. The building itself can even be 
accessed underground. 
  The building has been visited occasionally by a certain 
Colonel Zaykov and Mr. Frolov. Colonel Zaykov used to be a KGB 
attache, while Mr. Frolov was an adviser at the Foreign Trade 
Ministry. Currently, they both hold valid cards for foreigners 
with permanent residence here, and engage in business. How 
about selling these cultures to, let us say, Libya. Let us hope 
that the appropriate authorities will deal with this case in all 
seriousness.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes and Lubor Kohout report: "The Viral and </F>
Bacterial Strains Stored in the Central Military Hospital Are 
Destroyed Posthaste"] 
  [Text] In the CESKY DENIK on Thursday and Friday [17 and 
18 March, see referent item], we have reported the existence of 
still- maintained bacterial and viral strains developed for use 
as biological weapons. According to the findings by the CESKY 
DENIK reporters, one of the banks of these strains was concealed 
in the Central Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice. 
  Yesterday, Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys called an 
extraordinary news conference; as he phrased it, "just to calm 
down the public." 
  Antonin Baudys declared that he was first informed about the 
existence of the particularly dangerous viruses and bacteria on 
13 February of this year. Subsequently, he received more 
information from various sources on 17 February. On the basis 
of this information, an interdepartmental commission was formed, 
in which Health Ministry experts were also represented. The 
commission, according to Baudys, investigated and assessed the 
situation, and also decided to liquidate the biological bank 
quickly because it was "no longer useful." The bacterial and 
viral cultures were also destroyed under extraordinary security 
measures between 24 and 25 February with the knowledge and 
instructions of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and Army Chief 
of Staff Nekvasil. Furthermore, Baudys said that similar 
measures were also taken in the Techonin Military Research 
Institute at the beginning of March. It was precisely in this 
Institute that, according to the CESKY DENIK sources, biological 
weapons for the Warsaw Pact were developed. According to claims 
by the military representatives, however, this bank of 
biological cultures was a commonplace affair, and their 
maintenance did not violate any international treaties. 
  An employee of the Techonin Military Research Institute, 
Ales 
Macela, stated that in the facility where he works, no viral or 
bacterial strains have been cultivated for use in biological 
warfare. Moreover, he claimed that all documentation about the 
research has remained in Techonin. According to him, the 
research was conducted for defense purposes only. According to 
CESKY DENIK sources, however, the documentation was transferred 
to Prague under extraordinary security measures at the beginning 
of March. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Kalousek said that the Klinlab 
company had leased nonresidential premises in the Central 
Military Hospital building. It was precisely in the 
laboratories operated by this company that the bank of viral and 
bacterial cultures that were quickly destroyed on 25 February 
was stored.

<F P=106> [Lubor Kohout commentary: "From Baudys' Realm of Fantasy"] </F>
  [Text] Fairy tales are meant for children; of course, some 
adults like them too. Especially the old, traditional ones. 
The appeal of modern fairy tales is not so strong. Defense 
Minister Antonin Baudys, with the support of his subordinates, 
told us one like this last Friday [18 March]. The minister 
deemed it necessary to respond to the articles published in 
CESKY DENIK. They claimed that strains of bacteria and viruses 
intended for use as the basis for biological weapons are being 
stored (or concealed) in our military facilities. 
  If we summarize the statements made by the ministerial and 
army top brass, this is what we get: Bacteriological and 
virological weapons were never developed in our secret military 
facilities, and not at all for the purposes of the Warsaw Pact. 
The institute in Techonin never took part in such activity; the 
scientists in its laboratories only worked on immunological 
research. According to Ales Macela, the current vice president 
of the Military Medical Academy and a leading research worker at 
the Techonin institute, there were no technical conditions in 
his institute for achieving genetic changes in individual 
strains. The two batches of strains of bacteria and viruses -- 
the one in Techonin and the one that was kept in the building 
leased to the Klinlab (Clinical Laboratories) limited company in 
the Central Military Hospital in Stresovice -- were simply 
harmless batches prepared in case the state was involved in a 
defense emergency. Moreover, 80 percent of them were common 
viruses and a mere 20 percent were exotic viruses. Summa 
summarum: By storing the aforementioned strains, the army in no 
way violated the international convention on prohibiting the 
use, development, and accumulation of biological weapons. The 
interdepartmental commission, whose establishment was initiated 
by Baudys, decided that it was no longer necessary to keep the 
strains and, therefore, the viral banks were destroyed. 
Absolutely nothing happened -- irresponsible journalists from 
CESKY DENIK just want to injure our army. 
  In considering whether it is CESKY DENIK or the gentlemen 
from the Defense Ministry and the army who are telling fairy 
tales, it is enough to recall some of the facts confirmed by 
Minister Baudys himself and Chief of the General Staff Nekvasil: 
On 13 February, in connection with the personnel changes in the 
military health service department, Baudys finds out for the 
first time about the existence of batches of strains. An 
investigation follows, and on 17 February an interdepartmental 
commission is set up on Baudys' initiative. The swift 
destruction of the first batch in Stresovice begins during the 
next seven days. The defense minister personally orders the 
destruction. The chief of the General Staff also gives his 
personal guarantee that the destruction was carried out safely 
and that there was no risk. On 9 March the ministerial and army 
top brass receive the news that there is another batch of 
strains in Techonin in East Bohemia. Another swift destruction 
follows. 
  Other facts, not mentioned by Baudys, speak plainly. The 
whole affair has been investigated since the beginning by 
officers from Military Defense Intelligence (VOZ), who were 
present at the destruction along with the Military Police. VOZ 
is also taking care of the Techonin research documentation; of 
course, on Friday Ales Macela claimed that it is still stored in 
Techonin. The Defense Ministry is handing over part of the case 
to the Security and Information Service. What on earth for? 
After all, only allegedly "common and no longer necessary" 
strains were destroyed! 
  There were several ways Minister Baudys could have acted 
before Friday. One of these was telling the truth. He could 
have said that genetically altered viruses and bacteria 
developed for use as biological weapons had been concealed 
without his knowledge. He could have admitted that they are 
still -- in all probability -- "stored" in other, so far 
unknown, places. He chose another course of action, and thus 
associated himself with the people who had developed and 
concealed these materials. Parliamentary Foreign Affairs 
Committee Chairman Jiri Payne declared yesterday that the whole 
incident has to be thoroughly investigated. It only remains for 
me to add that, if CESKY DENIK has not reported the truth, the 
authors of the articles are, according to the law, criminally 
liable. They could, for example, have committed the crime of 
spreading alarming reports. If the defense minister is familiar 
with the criminal law, then he knows that he is required to 
submit a complaint. He will probably not do so, however, and he 
knows why. The ministerial fairy tales would not be enough to 
obtain a conviction in a law-governed state.

<F P=106> [Jan Benes commentary: "About Deputy Minister Kalousek's </F>
'Expedient Lie'"] 
  [Text] In the course of an extraordinary news conference 
called by the defense minister to calm down the public, Deputy 
Defense Minister Kalousek described the CESKY DENIK information 
about contributing to Klinlab equipment with Army supplies as an 
expedient lie. The deputy minister is apparently well-versed in 
the field so he knew what he was talking about. What he said 
was an expedient untruth. 
  This time around, we will not devote our attention to the 
problem of biological warfare agents (for, at this time, the 
explanation of the difference between an offensive and defensive 
cholera is beyond our ability). 
  We will leave that for some other time, including the 
military laboratories in Olesnice, as well as the equipment for 
the reproduction of viruses, with which the Techonin Research 
Institute was equipped despite the claims made by the Defense 
Ministry officials calming down the public. After all, it was 
from here that the Bulgarian, Romanian, GDR, and Russian experts 
-- who used to work here -- withdrew their research and 
documentation. 
  So, that is one group of expedient untruths. Let us, 
however, devote ourselves to the Klinlab Co., a company that 
operates in the building of the Military Hospital in 
[Prague-]Stresovice. It was precisely in the facility leased to 
Klinlab that the bank of "completely common viruses" was located 
that was destroyed on Defense Minister Baudys' order under 
extraordinary security measures. 
  First, already in 1992, expensive foreign-made equipment was 
bought for the Central Military Health Institution -- a 
laboratory glass washer, for instance, or an automatic analyzer 
-- just to guarantee a good future for the Central Military 
Hospital [UVN]. The purchases were made by the deputy chief of 
the Central Military Health Institution (UVZU), Dr. Moravek. 
The justification was that the UVZU would produce and market 
hygienically pure water for commercial purposes. Shortly 
thereafter, however, a questionnaire was circulated among the 
employees of this institution recruiting "experts" for the 
future private laboratory institute called Klinlab. The 
questionnaire was then used to justify (the people want it) the 
establishment of Klinlab. This company assumed, however, only 
the profit-making or profit promising part of the UVZU. Under 
the auspices of Economics Deputy Minister Kalousek, the company 
was authorized to manage the six-floor facility in the UVN by a 
contract dated 10 September 1993 and signed with the Army for 
Klinlab by no one else but Dr. Moravek, still an officer on 
active duty. He signed as the executive secretary of a company 
that had not yet been founded, much less registered. 
  This violates a good number of laws and regulations -- 
including the defense minister's order No. 9 of 11 February 1993. 
  Only a month after the signing of the lease (which leaves 
the 
owner with the obligations of the owner, including construction 
alterations), on 11 October 1993, the Klinlab company contract 
was signed, and only on 23 October 1993 is Klinlab entered on 
the company register. 
  In a state governed by rule of law, the contract would 
certainly be invalid. In a state governed by rule of law, the 
people signing such contracts would be considered cheats. 
Furthermore, Dr. Moravek and all the other officers from the 
Klinlab Ltd. who signed the contract brazenly violated Law 
143/1992 in its Article 3, Section 4 of the government 
instruction, according to which they are paid their salary with 
a 25 percent bonus provided they do not engage in business but 
only serve in the Army! 
  The Klinlab lease contract (let us assume that the same 
ministerial office is responsible for its organization, which 
refused other privatization projects, including one from Canada) 
rents the relevant part of the UVN for 720,123 korunas annually 
to the, of course, not yet existing legal entity, and the money 
was then lent to them interest-free for a fixed term, i.e., 
until the purchase contract is signed. All that happens on 1 
December 1993. Material and supplies worth dozens of millions is 
passed onto Klinlab without inventory, and when an inventory is 
taken of the furniture and equipment, it is calculated at 
write-off prices. Regarding the laboratory equipment valued at 
approximately 30 million korunas, then, Klinlab chooses what it 
needs and purchases (until the date of the purchase contract it 
will use it free of charge) the equipment at a later date. 
  So, this is the expedient lie about Engineer Kalousek of 
which we are guilty. 
  The military equipment that was profitable for the Army, 
including the equipment purchased for taxpayer's money, will 
pass into private hands. The money-losing equipment will be 
kept by the Army. 
  Of course, some soldiers wanted to object. That was an ill- 
advised idea. After all, the appropriate commission 
investigated it. Even Colonel Krizenecky put his iron in the 
fire, and so did Military Prosecutor Dr. Novak. The same one 
who was investigating but never concluded the investigation of 
the activities of another man of the Kalousek-type at the 
Defense Ministry, the current director of the Nase Vojsko [Our 
Army] publishing house, Jakub Cisar -- of course, that was still 
in the Orbis publishing house. 
  We will reach the stage of socialism in our country, we will 
be successful in defending the peace, and we will thwart the 
iniquitous activities of traitors, and so on along the arduous 
path towards a better tomorrow. The officers will get paid (by 
us, friends) for not engaging in business. They conduct 
business (with our money). Are we to believe that the sale of 
microbes, eventually to be thrown into a synagogue as an 
example, presents a problem for such enterprising entrepreneurs?

<F P=106> [J. Vujadinovic report: "At Risk Even With `Common' Sex"] </F>
  [Text] Regarding the trend that hitherto placed drug 
addicts at the top of the groups most at risk of contracting the 
AIDS virus, according to data for the last year for the Belgrade 
area, where there is the greatest concentration of registered 
cases, a certain increase of AIDS cases among heterosexuals has 
been detected. 
  According to Verica Ilic, epidemiologist from the City 
Institute for Health Care, in the course of the last year 32 HIV 
positive cases were registered, 43 diseased cases, and 58 
fatalities. The institute registered some 30 HIV positive cases 
among drug addicts, while 31 people contracted the virus through 
heterosexual intercourse. 
  "Two years ago intravenous drug addicts were the group most 
at risk. However, last year there was a considerable decrease 
of cases in this group -- from 59.7 percent (registered 1992), 
the percentage of drug addicts in the total number of HIV 
positive cases dropped to 36.6 percent. On the other hand, in 
1992 there were 23.6 percent of cases that had contracted HIV 
virus through heterosexual intercourse, while in 1993 there was 
a considerable increase in the number of such cases, jumping to 
32.9 percent of the total," Ilic says. 
  How then can the possible mass spreading of AIDS virus be 
prevented in the future, in view of such a turnabout of the 
groups at risk, placing heterosexuals ahead? 
  "The most difficult thing is to control the sexual behavior 
of people, and make them change it. It is particularly 
difficult, in view of the turbulent times that we are living in, 
to make young people change it. AIDS is certainly a deadly 
disease, but those are also an entrance for all the problems 
that the young people have today [sentence as published]. On 
the one hand, sex is an outlet, but on the other hand, nobody 
has enough time for teenagers. It is precisely for that reason 
that we are insisting on talking to them and educating them," 
Viktorija Cucic, Yugoslav coordinator for AIDS with the WHO and 
chairman of the Yugoslav Association for AIDS Prevention. 
  Starting from the association's basic goal -- to educate as 
many young people as possible, in order to prevent death from 
ignorance -- the travelling caravan headed by Cucic has recently 
arrived in Montenegro, where a seminar has been held for 95 
youngsters. "We also work with the teachers, using the program 
"Together Against AIDS." It is about educational seminars 
comprising six lessons each, which involve the most contemporary 
educational methods. After the seminars, the teachers 
themselves organize courses in their schools for students," 
Cucic explains. She also underlines that, given the poor 
financial circumstances in Yugoslav health care, knowledge and 
sane behavior are now the only available instruments for 
fighting AIDS, so the association is making efforts to equip the 
people with those instruments in order to develop in them 
responsibility for their own health.

Concern"] 
  [Text] During 1993, the number of patients suffering from 
brucellosis decreased markedly in comparison to the figure for 
1992. According to data from the republic's Institute for 
Preventative Medicine, last year there were 561 cases, as 
opposed to 922 in 1992. The Director of the Institute for 
Epidemiology and Microbiology, Dr. Dusko Panev, cautioned that 
brucellosis remains a serious problem in the republic. In view 
of the unquestionable effect of the struggle against the spread 
of this animal disease among humans, there will not only be a 
continuing campaign against it in the forthcoming period, but 
also a determined "plugging" of some "cracks" in the defensive 
lines. 
  First and foremost, explained Dr. Panev, the number of 
opstinas [townships] and inhabited places where the disease has 
been registered does not show such a great decline. More 
precisely, if in 1992 brucellosis was in evidence in 177 
inhabited places within 22 opstinas, last year the disease 
"climbed" in 150 inhabited places within 19 opstinas, in other 
words, it remained present on the territory throughout the 
republic. In the previous period, the "hottest" places were the 
districts of Strumica (133 as opposed to 154 cases in 1992), 
Radovis (103), Valandovo (45), Skopje (59), Kumanovo, 
Veles...[as published] 
  In contrast to the still problematic private sector, the 
social sector is much more effective in the struggle against 
this animal disease. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated 
that the reasons for the spread are most often connected with 
contact of the individual producers and through the consumption 
of impure milk and cheese from goats and sheep. 
  According to Dr. Panev, "Despite all the effort, it is still 
possible to find milk producers at the market who do not have 
adequate safety certification. And it is exactly from such food 
items that people have become ill with brucellosis in the past 
few years. Earlier, this disease was a job-related illness of 
herdsmen and veterinarians. But now, the victims are those who 
have not observed commonly accepted preventive measures, 
(pasturizing milk and cheese) both among families raising 
livestock and those supplied by them." 
  The struggle against brucellosis is a complex, longterm 
process that may take several decades. Since 1980, when the 
disease appeared here in epidemic form, the main forces in the 
eradication campaign have been veterinarians and health workers. 
Dr. Panev explained that, last year alone, medical personnel 
carried out more than 13,000 serological tests and more than 
14,000 medical examinations, placed 426 inhabited places under 
medical supervision, and visited 1,184 sites.... 
  With early detection of the disease and the use of effective 
medicines, the intensity and the channels through which the 
disease is transmitted from one medium to another are localized 
and defenses are established. In this area, cooperation with 
veterinary bodies is exceptional. Meanwhile, the "gates" have 
opened a little for some other organizations whose participation 
is necessary to increase the effectiveness of the effort. 
Foremost in this respect are the police organzations that are 
often overlooked in the transportation of livestock; they should 
be demanding the compulsory "veterinary" certificates which are 
shown for exactly these reasons. The services should also 
provide compensation for the sick animals that are destroyed. 
But when the "injured parties" are humble, it is not surprising 
that some shepherds see the solution to their problems in 
marketing products from sick animals in a neighboring villages 
or opstinas.... This cycle, in any case, must be stopped.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional public health and epidemiological 
developments monitored through 25 March. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Whooping Cough -- Bogota health officials have reported 17 
children have died due to whooping cough in Bajo Naya, on the 
border between Valle and Cauca. The Health Commission has gone 
into the Indian communities to confirm an alleged condition but 
found the cause to be an epidemic of whooping cough. (Santa Fe 
de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 6 March 94 pp 1, 8) 
<H5>  Costa Rica </H5>
  AIDS -- According to the latest statistics released by the 
Health Ministry, there have been 23 new cases of AIDS this year 
-- 11 by homosexuals and seven by heterosexuals, all of whom 
contracted the disease through sexual contact. The cause is 
unknown in one of the cases. The incidence of women is very 
low, according to the official report, as only one woman is 
registered for every 11 men. So far there have been 586 cases 
reported nationwide, half of which are in San Jose. (San Jose 
LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 19 March 94 p 9A) 
<H5>  Ecuador </H5>
  AIDS -- Health Minister Dr. Patricio Abad has reported there 
has been an evident increase in the number of AIDS cases in 
Ecuador, which now total 714. The incidence increased to .62 
per every 100,000 inhabitants during 1993. [figures as received] 
The most cases have been registered in the coastal area. 
(Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 14 March 94) 
  Diphtheria -- A epidemic has been reported in Quito, 
according to Health Ministry officials. Despite statements 
denying further spreading of the illness, the cases are still 
increasing in number; there are 25 cases so far, and two people 
have already died. The ministry has only 700,000 doses of the 
vaccine but has begun a massive inoculation campaign to try and 
control the epidemic. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2026 GMT 21 March 
94) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  Cholera -- Cholera continues to thwart the poor areas of 
Quetzaltenango, as six people have died within a short period. 
Authorities have been unsuccessful in convincing relatives to 
bury their dead quickly, instead of mourning them for the usual 
24 hours. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 17 March 94 p 
33) 
  Cholera -- Health officials have reported cholera has hit 
Escuintla, Guatemala, and Izabal Departments the hardest, with 
34 percent, 26 percent, and 6.8 percent of the cases 
respectively. Health Minister Gustavo Hernandez has told 
reporters during a meeting with international health 
organizations there has been a 33-percent increase in the number 
of cases this year in relation to the same period in 1993. 
(Guatemala City SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 23 March 94 p 3) 
<H5>  Honduras </H5>
  Cholera -- Atlantic Coast communities have reported six new 
cases of cholera. Official reports state the total figure is 
640 for the first three months of the year, and 16 people have 
died. Officials are bracing for the Easter holidays, as 
thousands of vacationers converge on regional beaches. (Hamburg 
DPA in Spanish 1742 GMT 24 March 94) 
<H5>  Mexico </H5>
  Mange -- Chihuahua Indians are suffering from mange, 
according to a report by a group of missionaries touring poor 
communities in the region. A Tarahumara community near the U.S. 
border has 70 cases. Missionaries have called the situation an 
epidemic, as cases tend to increase due to the high level of 
malnutrition and the lack of health services in the area. 
(Madrid EFE in Spanish 2224 GMT 13 March 94) 
<H5>  Panama </H5>
  AIDS -- Epidemiologist Xavier Saenz-Llorens, from the 
Children's Hospital, has reported there are 625 children under 
the age of 15 who have the AIDS virus. Overall, there are 
approximately 15,000 cases nationwide. Eleven children have 
died so far. A good 95 percent of these cases are due to 
prenatal infection, meaning they contracted the disease inside 
the womb. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 22 March 
94 p A1) 
  HIV -- Dr. Amalia French, director of Santo Tomas Hospital, 
has reported there are approximately 30,000 HIV carriers in 
Panama, meaning, she explained, 15,000 to 20,000 people will 
develop the disease over the next 10 years. Health officials 
say there are insufficient resources to deal with such a high 
number and stress the need for prevention. (Panama City

<F P=106> [Articles by Juan Carlos Rivera and Alberto Salazar] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In recent months, as a result 
of our country's sanatorium policy, consideration has been given 
to reincorporating AIDS patients into society. This raises the 
possibility of outpatient treatment with ongoing medical 
checkups and monitoring of the virus and illustrates our respect 
for patients as individuals and the protection of their human 
rights. Reincorporation, which will be only for those who have 
accepted their condition as HIV-positive, are sufficiently 
mature and psychologically well balanced, and display 
responsible social and sexual conduct, will not mean the 
disappearance of the sanatoriums. The move is part of Cuba's 
advancing and consistent program for battling AIDS. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Box, p 8] </H5>
  The AIDS sanatorium in Pinar del Rio has 44 patients, 
although there were 96 HIV-positives in the provinces in October 
1993. The rest are in Los Cocos in Havana. There have been 20 
deaths since the disease emerged. The sanatorium has 48 
employees. Its director, Dr. Angel Fulladosa, says that surveys 
in college preparatory schools in the province reveal that 
youngsters know quite a bit about AIDS. Most, however, answer 
yes to this question: "And if you feel like it, do you have 
sexual relations even if you know that you are HIV-positive?" 
[passage omitted] 
  Moreover, drugstores are no longer carrying condoms, and 
youngsters are not in the habit of using them anyway. The high 
risk groups in the province are girls 14 to 18 and boys 16 to 
20. There are other risk groups as well, though. There is 
systematic monitoring in the province, and 700,000 tests have 
been done since studies began in 1986. This enables us to say 
that there must not be more than a few undetected cases in the 
province. 
  The young people here can receive visits from their 
relatives 
or go home for several days, and this helps their morale 
greatly. Some sanatoriums have also started gradually releasing 
patients back into their neighborhoods. They have good relations 
here with the locals, and friendships are developing. All of 
this is helping to make the youngsters less aggressive. Proper, 
humanitarian treatment improves social relations, Fulladosa 
says, as we tour the sanatorium's new facilities under 
construction: soon to be completed bungalows among the trees 
with a maximum capacity of 150. 
  While many governments and health-care systems around the 
world seem powerless or at least bewildered by the geometric 
spread of AIDS, Cuba still has an extremely low rate of HIV 
infection, under 0.01. The containment of the epidemic on our 
island is often attributed, especially overseas, to the 
sanatorium policy implemented by local medical authorities. As a 
result, many will be surprised to hear that Cuba now proposes to 
provide outpatient treatment to every HIV-positive person who 
wants to and can receive it. 
  This decision does not, however, imply that the country is 
even partially giving up on an institution that has proven its 
effectiveness in containing the disease. BOHEMIA asked Dr. 
Reinaldo Gil Suarez, who runs the National Program Against AIDS, 
and Dr. Mariluz Rodriguez Alvarez, the director of the National 
Health Education Center, to comment on this subject. 
  "The National Program Against AIDS is 10 years old now," 
explains Gil Suarez. "The first measures were taken in 1983. 
They consisted of a system of surveillance against opportunistic 
diseases and a ban on imports of blood products from countries 
in which AIDS was present. This averted major problems for us. 
Because we ourselves produced these drugs, with the necessary 
rigor and care, the number of people who got infected this way 
can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and concurrently the 
nation developed its own technology for manufacturing these 
items. 
  "In late 1985 and early 1986 we looked into the possibility 
of doing testing with diagnostic kits in spite of their high 
price on the market. We also decided to fight AIDS as just 
another sexually transmitted disease, by identifying risk 
groups, undertaking major prevention and education efforts among 
the population, and preventing infection through the perinatal 
route. 
  "Another element in the strategy was the establishment of 
sanatoriums for those who tested HIV-positive. HIV-positives 
were thus surrounded by various kinds of specialists to prevent 
fatal complications, and the chances of the virus spreading 
among the healthy population were considerably lessened. 
  "As you can see, the system of sanatoriums is one of the 
pillars of our success in battling AIDS, but it is not the only 
one." 
  At this point in the conversation Dr. Rodriguez Alvarez 
remarked that outpatient treatment is not altogether new, 
inasmuch as several HIV-positive persons have been receiving it 
for five years, either full-time or taking periodic leaves in 
the company of medical personnel or a relative who makes sure 
that their behavior on the street is above reproach. 
  "Outpatient treatment," the director of the National Health 
Education Center adds, "represents a higher stage in the 
development of the program and should in no way be related to 
the financial limitations facing the country. We have been and 
will be unstinting with resources in battling the disease, and 
the proof of this is that those who avail themselves of this 
arrangement will continue to receive medication absolutely free 
of charge and a special diet that meets all protein and calorie 
requirements. 
  "Now then," Dr. Suarez Gil says, retaking the floor, "not 
all 
sanatorium patients will automatically be reincorporated into 
society. Each sanatorium has commissions that decide which 
patients are responsible enough about their own health and that 
of the community. There is enough background information for a 
correct decision in each case, because we are familiar with the 
earlier lives of these persons, their work and social history, 
their ethical values, the families they came from, and, 
something very important, their behavior inside the sanatorium, 
how they are reconciling themselves to the disease, etc. 
  "In addition to the principle of selectivity, there is also 
the principle of choice. No patient will be forced to accept 
outpatient treatment even if the medical commission decides that 
he can. Only those who deserve and want it can receive it. We 
even anticipate offering them the chance to keep on living in 
the sanatorium and to study or work on the outside. 
  "They are also guaranteed ongoing specialized medical care, 
whether at the sanatorium, through family physicians (who have 
been appropriately trained in this connection), in provincial 
hospitals, or at the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical 
Medicine," Gil Suarez notes. 
  "As we see things," Dr. Rodriguez Alvarez remarks, 
"reincorporating HIV-positive people into their families and 
into society at large will reinforce the prevention and 
education work that we physicians are doing in various ways. The 
message will be most effective among young people, who represent 
the highest risk group, because it will be conveyed by people 
their own age who dress the same, have the same general tastes, 
the same psychology, and ways of looking at the world...." 
  "The patients are displaying an admirable willingness to 
cooperate in this connection. The sanatoriums have done a lot of 
work with them, and we should underscore their involvement in a 
prevention system that they themselves have inspired and built 
in the centers in which they are patients. AIDS patients and 
HIV-positives are represented on the AIDS national technical 
commission, and one of them, a physician, is even the head of 
the prevention section. 
  "I should point out that outpatient care is not granted for 
a 
specific period of time. The behavior of the people who can and 
choose to avail themselves of this treatment will be 
systematically monitored, and if they are unruly or violate, 
even in a minor way, the principles on which it rests, they are 
brought back into the sanatorium permanently."

<F P=106> [Article by Marco Bustamente: "War Against Onchocerciasis"; </F>
first paragraph is editorial introduction] 
  [Excerpt] More than one year ago VISTAZO reported on the 
possibility that Ecuador would be the first country in the world 
to control Onchocerciasis. This possibility is about to become a 
reality. 
  Discovered in Ecuador in the Province of Esmeraldas in the 
mid 1970's, Onchocerciasis, a disease caused by a fly bite which 
can end up causing blindness in its victims, received attention 
in the Ecuadoran press a little more than one year ago. The 
reason for the attention was unfortunately the low state of 
public health in that province. A discussion of the cause of 
this situation ranged between malaria, a viral disease related 
to AIDS, and "river blindness," or Onchocerciasis. 
  The positive aspect of this discussion, as VISTAZO reported, 
lay in the possibility that, because the territory in which the 
disease has been found is limited to rural areas of the Province 
of Esmeraldas, its transmission can be controlled, and this 
illness can be eradicated. This prediction was made by Ronald 
Guderian, a North American researcher from Vozandes Hospital in 
Quito. It was regarded with healthy skepticism by VISTAZO. Up to 
now the only disease in the world which has been successfully 
eradicated has been measles. This was done following an effort 
made by thousands of scientists, the expenditure of millions of 
dollars, and the passage of more than two decades. Furthermore, 
the last time that the term "eradication" was used in Ecuador 
was in connection with malaria. And although the National 
Service for the Eradication of Malaria, or SNEM, the government 
office in charge of handling this disease, still does not 
consider that the illness has been conquered, malaria 
eradication in Ecuador for the moment remains a well-intentioned 
wish, rather than a realistic goal. 
  Nevertheless, the control and eventual eradication of 
Onchocerciasis is quite probable in Ecuador. Guderian says, 
"Yes, Onchocerciasis can be controlled." In fact he is the 
principal author of the "National Plan for the Elimination of 
Onchocerciasis in Ecuador," which he wrote in collaboration with 
Dr. Mariela Anselmi and Dr. Alberto Narvaez, of the Ministry of 
Public Health. Action on the plan began in 1993 and will be 
completed in 1997. The difference between this document and 
other, similar plans which have only been on paper, can be 
summarized in two terms: money and the effective distribution of 
medicine to those suffering from the disease. 
  Guderian and his team, with the cooperation of the Ministry 
of Health, have obtained funds from foreign sources amounting to 
$170,000 for the first year of the program. By 1997 these funds 
will have totaled $730,000. This will be the financial cost of 
freeing Ecuador and nearly 25,000 Ecuadorans -- principally 
black citizens and members of the "Chachi" tribe of Indians in 
Esmeralda Province. 
  As a result Ecuador is in an excellent position to be the 
first country to control the spread of this disease and 
accomplish its eradication, due to the availability of money, 
including funds from the local, private sector, the limited 
geographic distribution of the disease, the previous experience 
of Ecuadoran and foreign researchers, the lack of excessive 
bureaucracy in the program, the improved, though modest, 
cooperation of the Ministry of Health, and the donation of a 
medicine called "Ivermectina" by the Merck Pharmaceutical 
Company. 
  Guderian has said: "According to the goals agreed upon at 
two 
recent, scientific meetings, our goals are stopping the spread 
of the disease by the year 2000 and achieving its eradication by 
2011." Evaluation of the program at the national level will be 
conducted by Dr. Jose Rumbea, professor of tropical medicine at 
the University of Guayaquil and an associate of Guderian in the 
control program. 
<H5>  Key Drug </H5>
  Rural areas of the Province of Esmeraldas basically have 
onchocerciasis because, in the affected areas -- the basins of 
the Cayapas and Santiago Rivers and other, small areas where the 
disease is found -- there are flies of the "Simulium" variety, 
known popularly as "juros" [always there], which transmit the 
disease. For example, when a person living in the Province of 
Esmeralda or an Indian of the "Chachi" tribe goes to the rivers 
to get water, he or she is bitten by a fly already infected with 
so-called "microfilary" parasites. In the bite the fly injects 
onchocerciasis larvae, which eventually settle in subcutaneous 
skin tissue, where they develop into adult worms. These worms 
are encapsulated by the body. In an attempt to isolate them the 
body forms subcutaneous nodules. Inside these nodules are worms 
which produce thousands of microfilary parasites which spread 
out into nearby body tissue. Immune reactions against the 
microfilary parasites, which account for most of the symptoms, 
can cause anything from blindness to skin wrinkles. If the 
microfilary parasites block lymphatic circulation, it is 
possible to see elephantiasis, a grotesque and pendulous growth 
of tissue alongside the obstruction. 
  Trying to control the flies has turned out to be impractical 
because of the cost. The strategy which Guderian and his 
associates have followed is based on "taking away the raw 
material," so to speak, from the flies transmitting the disease. 
How is this done? In the first place, by extracting the 
subcutaneous nodules, where the adult worms produce thousands of 
microfilary parasites. This procedure is called "nodulectomy." 
Secondly, trying to reduce the number of microfilary parasites 
which, after leaving the nodules, move to the surrounding 
tissue, waiting for a fly which transmits the disease but is not 
yet infected to bite the sick person. The fly then becomes 
infected and can bite another, healthy person, continuing the 
transmission of the disease. The drug which successfully kills 
these microfilary parasites is called "Ivermectina." It has been 
donated by the Merck Pharmaceutical Company to the control 
program, thanks in part to efforts made by Dr. Plutarco Naranjo, 
the former minister of health. 
  During the periodic trips which the researchers make to the 
areas affected by the disease they have evaluated more than 
20,000 persons who have the disease. They provide them with 
"Ivermectina" twice a year and, if necessary, perform 
nodulectomies to remove the adult worms. According to Dr. 
Marlene Silva, coordinator of the present program, "When we go 
to see them, the great majority of the patients are interested 
in receiving `Ivermectina.' We work with their community 
leaders. Only in this way have we succeeded in reaching those 
20,000 patients." In effect, according to Doctor Rumbea, who 
evaluates the results, "We have seen how, in certain cases, the 
number of microfilary parasites has been reduced after treatment 
from about 1,000 microfilary parasites per cubic millimeter of 
skin down to two or three microfilary parasites per cubic 
millimeter. Furthermore, the program for controlling 
onchocerciasis in Ecuador can serve as a guide for other 
programs, like the one in Colombia." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Said Gada: "Tizi-Ouzou: Diphtheria Panic" -- </F>
first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] Diphtheria is worse than AIDS. At least in the way 
it is transmitted (through the air). This important detail had 
created widespread panic among the people. Among the medical 
community, though, there is calm although the basic tools for 
responding do not exist. Thus far quickly eradicating the 
epidemic remains uncertain. 
  Ever since this epidemic spread in the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou, 
there has been a combat-like commotion among local public-health 
authorities. Six people have died, a total of 140 people have 
been hospitalized, and there were as many cases of healthy 
carriers, it was reported at the University Hospital Center. 
Besides, the state of alert is always maintained. 
  However at the "Antidiphtheria Combat Committee," which had 
been set up as soon as the epidemic appeared, they are clear 
about it. For them, the situation has just about been brought 
under control. It should be mentioned that this 
multidisciplinary group made up of experts continues to meet 
each Sunday to get updated on the situation. 
  It has been pointed out that the first case of diphtheria 
was 
reported in Ath Zmenzer, a rural community of 11,000 located 
about 10 km from the town of Tizi-Ouzou. A young ninth grade 
student died and several people were infected. Not only had the 
news shaken village residents it had also produced major panic. 
The rush to get vaccinated was indescribable. The small 
treatment room could clearly not satisfy everyone. The doctor at 
the health center, who only works mornings (?), and was 
overwhelmed, had to push the panic-stricken crowd back. 
  Because of the confusion between antidiphtheria vaccines and 
DWTP (diphtheria, whopping cough, tetanus, and poliomyelitis), 
several people ran to private pharmacies (because public-sector 
pharmacies did not sell them) to buy some. 
<H5>  Limited Vaccination </H5>
  After the death of this teenager, only some members of his 
family were vaccinated, it was said. As to the grade school he 
attended, it would appear matters were not taken seriously. One 
teacher recalled: "The day the vaccination team arrived at our 
school, only the dead boy's class was vaccinated and the teacher 
who was in class at the exact time they arrived." 
  Several months later, the wait was still on. Among all of 
the 
staff and all the students, the panic was continuous. 
  Dr. Bourbia, the main leader in the antidiphtheria fight, 
stated that: "a real panic arose around the vaccination in 
Tizi-Ouzou. Of course, even if the vaccines are available, you 
cannot vaccinate an entire population. People need to understand 
that you can only vaccinate [text illegible], such as the family 
or classmates where school children are involved." 
  In fact, these vaccination "criteria" are not followed, as 
we 
have just seen. Is this an isolated case? Don't be too sure of 
it! The people's vaccination coverage is far from satisfying the 
required standards. This epidemic revealed all. 
  At Draa Ben Khedda, a medium-sized city, the situation is 
more dramatic. It is Sunday, 30 January, and the time is 1000. 
At the city's polyclinic, many people are waiting. Parents are 
anxious. A middle-aged woman carrying a baby in her arms 
exclaims: "I have come for my baby's second vaccination and they 
have just told me there isn't any." 
  A nurse would add that: "We are out of our supply of DWTP 
and 
we have been for 10 days. We are expecting a delivery of vaccine 
any day now." Given this situation, parents had to buy it for 
106 Algerian dinars. For their part, pharmacists pointed out 
that all the vaccines were gone and that their orders would not 
be filled until the end of February. In every corner of the 
wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou, the diphtheria epidemic is still a primary 
discussion topic. 
  For their part, public-health officials are reassuring. They 
say that of the 140 cases of diphtheria, there were few typical 
cases, and that the number of new cases is clearly declining. 
According to these same officials, the patients are responding 
well, "despite the lack of serum and the insufficiency of 
vaccines." In addition, we would point out that the Nedir 
Mohamed Hospital made available 30 beds from their infectious 
diseases unit and 40 beds from their psychiatric unit. So every 
possible agency was requisitioned and nine patients were 
transferred to the El-Kettar Hospital in Algiers. Furthermore, 
it was revealed that the individuals affected are, generally 
speaking, between the ages of 10 and 15 who were poorly 
vaccinated or not at all. As to the origin of this epidemic, a 
source in the medical community stated that the population of 
the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou was infected by a citizen of the wilaya 
of Bouira who was reported to have stayed in the south of 
Algeria (a region supposedly infected by peoples of the Sahara). 
  It should be noted that the affected areas are the most 
remote (Azzefoun, Ain El-Hammam, Draa El-Mizan). In these very 
remote areas, the people are very far away from health services. 
One country doctor said that he had not been aware of the 
existence of diphtheria in his area until after the burial of 
one patient. 
  Well, now! Even the medical community is caught unaware. For 
some, [diphtheria] is basically a childhood disease. 
Furthermore, it is said that there exists another viral illness 
(infectious mononucleosis) that has the same symptoms as 
diphtheria. 
  Upper respiratory ailments (influenza, colds, angina) make 
it 
difficult to diagnose positive diphtheria cases, they go on to 
say. In the case of Dr. Bourbia, he has to wait until the end of 
the winter, which would bring its share of upper respiratory 
illnesses, to isolate the diphtheria cases and hope to eradicate 
it once and for all. But, when you are dealing with an epidemic, 
no one can predict how it will develop. Several questions remain. 
  How did we get to this point? Was vaccination coverage 
correct? At school, is the vaccination certificate 
systematically required? Have the public-health officials 
assumed their responsibilities to force parents to vaccinate 
their children who were born at home? 
  Diphtheria is a contagious, deadly illness. You can be a 
healthy carrier and transmit the disease to anybody who is 
unvaccinated. In other words, the lives of many of us are in 
danger.

Under a decision by the Greater Sochi Administration, all 
foreigners coming to our country, including inhabitants of the

they have been tested for the virus, or undergo a test then and

<F P=106> [Igor Chernyak report under the rubric "According to Rumors </F>
and From Authoritative Sources": "AIDS in Army Colors"] 
  [Text] In an interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Viktor 
Kolkov, chief physician of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Defense, denied a report carried in certain newspapers that 13 
Russian Armed Forces officers have been diagnosed with AIDS and 
are under examination by Army medics. In his words, as of today 
there are no AIDS sufferers in the Russian Army and Navy. 
However, since 1989 15 carriers of this illness, that is to 
say, HIV-positive persons, have been detected by military 
medics. Five are continuing service in the troops, under 
constant medical supervision. Ten have been discharged to the 
reserves and transferred to the supervision of the civilian 
health organs. The virus was detected in officers up to 40 
years of age, and the majority were infected while on leave or 
tours of duty. 
  Viktor Kolkov said that work on diagnosing AIDS in the 
Russian Armed Forces began back in 1987, and in 1989 
laboratories for research into infection and immunization were 
set up. (According to information not confirmed by the chief 
physician, these laboratories exist today in dozens of 
hospitals, and a special department for the treatment of 
HIV-positive patients operates in Podolsk Military Hospital.) 
Kolkov also said that servicemen giving blood, foreigners 
studying in military academies, Russian servicemen returning 
from foreign tours of duty, and persons infected with venereal 
diseases and also certain other clinical illnesses are subject 
to compulsory testing for HIV. 
  Induction commissions, according to Kolkov, are not yet 
charged with testing draftees for AIDS, except in cases where 
commission doctors have reasons for suspicion. "We have 
already tested more than 1.5 million persons; we are simply 
unable to test all draftees and personnel," Kolkov said. At the 
same time Viktor Kolkov rejected forecasts that the number of 
AIDS and HIV sufferers in the Army will increase dramatically in 
the near future. In his words, there are no grounds for panic, 
and conditions in this respect are incomparably better in the 
Russian Armed Forces than in the U.S. and other Western 
countries' armies.

"Ufa Remains a Place Dangerous to Life"] 
  [Text] Research by scientists has shown that in individual 
parts of Ufa the maximum permissible concentrations of an 
extremely toxic substance -- dioxin -- in the air exceed the 
norm by tens of times. In the area where the "Khimprom" 
Production Association, which produces herbicides, is located 
this figure is equal to almost 20,000 times the maximum 
permissible concentration. Newborn babies take in up to 80 
times the maximum permissible concentration of dioxin every day 
with their mother's milk. The republic's gene pool is perishing 
catastrophically. Mothers' milk and the blood and adipose 
tissue of the inhabitants of Bashkortostan are literally 
"larded" with toxic substances in quantities dangerous to life. 
This has been stated by Gennadiy Minin, the republic's chief 
state physician. 
  Misfortune came to the land of Bashkortostan in April 1990. 
Unpurified waste and drainage water from Ufa's "Khimprom" flowed 
into the city water intake, poisoning thousands of cubic meters 
of drinking water with phenol. Knowing nothing, almost all the 
residents of the city with a population of 1 million used 
poisoned water for a long time. Then a large amount of dioxin 
was discovered in the water, the air, and the soil. 
  Despite the city folk's protests, "Khimprom" is continuing 
to 
poison the environment or, rather, what is left of it. In 
addition, one more installation in Ufa has been discovered which 
is surreptitiously destroying nature and people with dioxin -- 
an experimental plant for the production of herbicides. 
  Equipment to analyze the content of dioxin in the 
environment 
was purchased abroad at tremendous expense. But this is not the 
first year that it has been lying totally inactive. Taking 
advantage of the lack of control over it, the Bashkortostan 
State Committee for Ecology and Nature Use is squandering huge 
sums allocated to nature conservation. But a start has not been 
made on resolving the "dioxin problem" in the republic.

military towns. In Belarus, there are 16 such settlements that 
are to be handed over to various religious groups and the ICFB 
according to a government resolution. These organizations, with 
the help of investors and other sides that are involved in this 
process, should convert them into convalescent spas for people 
who suffered from the Chernobyl disaster, nursing homes, hotels, 
and other facilities. [Begin recording] 
  Unidentified Reporter: Nikolay 
Nikolayevich, how will the ICFB carry out the conversion of 
military towns? 
  Unidentified ICFB official: At a recently held 
ICFB conference, which was attended by all leading religious 
groups and officials of the nine ministries that support our 
work, a decision was adopted on the ICFB's participation in the 
conversion of military towns. A meeting with representatives of 
the Chernobyl Union -- which has already taken over some 
military towns -- showed that the Chernobyl Union supports this 
idea. A meeting between Ivan [name indistinct] and 
representatives of leading religious groups confirmed that the 
government agrees to hand over military towns to the ICFB and 
Belarus' leading religious groups. [end recording] 
  To begin with, officials of the involved organizations will 
visit those facilities to inspect the buildings. Later, 
reconstruction and modernization of those facilities will begin, 
to ensure that military towns serve the people well. The idea 
is good, if only there are enough resources to implement it.

<F P=106> [Article by Leena Hietanen: "Estonian Abortion Numbers </F>
Highest in Europe"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- In Western countries the women who need 
abortions are young and unmarried using abortion to postpone 
their first time of giving birth. In Estonia abortion is used 
most often by women who are married and have already had 
children. This is the finding of a study published last fall 
which is the first study of its kind in the region covered by 
the former USSR. 
<H5>  First Pregnancy Leads to Marriage </H5>
  The abortion study was conducted by Estonian population 
researchers Kalev Katus and Allan Puur together with the 
University of Michigan. The study is part of a broader study on 
fertility. 
  Some 360 women who had had abortions in a Tallinn hospital 
during 1991 were interviewed in the study. The researchers had 
hospital data on the women in addition to the information 
supplied by the women. 
  The information supplied by the women and the hospital had a 
high degree of correlation, which is a significant difference 
between this study and studies elsewhere in the world. In 
Sweden, for example, women reported only one-half of their 
abortions, and in the United States only one-third. 
  "In general, no moral or guilt issues are connected with 
abortion, and thus they are no embarrassment," says Allan Puur. 
  Sixty-eight percent of the women having abortions are 
married, 18 percent are in cohabitation arrangements, and 14 
percent are unmarried. In Western countries an average of 75 
percent of abortions are by young, unmarried women. 
  In Estonia the first pregnancy generally leads to marriage. 
When a woman becomes pregnant she would rather legalize the 
relationship. In Estonia the age at which women get married is 
quite young, 23, while in Finland this age is 26, and in Sweden 
27. 
  The objective of the study is to determine who are the women 
that resort to abortions the most often. 
  "The ethnic background was the most consistent factor 
apparent for those who choose abortion as a means of birth 
control. Russian women have more abortions than Estonian women 
do," observed Allan Puur. 
  According to the study, 43 percent of the Estonian women had 
had no previous abortions. The comparable figure for 
non-Estonian women was 29 percent. Four percent of the Estonians 
and 9 percent of non-Estonians had had three abortions 
previously. 
  "For Estonian women an abortion is usually the result of an 
unsuccessful effort at birth control, whereas for Russians it is 
actually the primary means of birth control," says Puur. 
  According to the researchers the difference in conduct for 
Estonian and Russian women is basically due to the different 
times at which changes in population growth patterns first 
became apparent. In Estonia, the drop from a high fertility rate 
to a low one occurred much earlier than in Russia. That is why 
there is a much older tradition of controlling population growth 
in Estonia. 
  Allan Puur does not believe that prostitution is in any way 
reflected in the statistics. The number of abortions in Estonia 
was high already decades prior to abortion becoming an issue. 
  Customs that originated during the USSR era may be one 
explanation as to why abortion is used as a method of birth 
control. 
  The researchers included a question on whether birth control 
means had been used in the period of time preceding the last 
abortion. Fifty-two percent of Estonian women had been using 
some means of birth control while the comparable figure for 
non-Estonians was 18 percent. 
<H5>  Birth Control Expensive </H5>
  A gynecologist at Tallinn Central Hospital, Mall Varvas, 
feels that Estonia's high abortion numbers are due to the fact 
that society has a positive attitude toward abortion. 
  During the last three years it has been easy to obtain 
contraceptives in Estonia. Condoms are found in drug stores and 
on the shelves of newsstands. The most popular item, an 
intrauterine device, costs 50 kroons or about 20 markkas. Birth 
control pills cost about 20-25 markkas per month, which is too 
much for young women, according to Mall Varvas. The intrauterine 
device is most popular with both women who have and who have not 
given birth because of its lower cost. Abortions are usually 
free of cost. For those who do not belong to the government 
health program it costs about 180 markkas. 
  Varvas suspects that the young do not like to use condoms 
for 
the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases has increased 
significantly. 
  "The low level of contraceptive use is a result of a lack of 
concern about one's own personal health in Estonia. People do 
not talk about healthy life-styles." 
  "There are also deficiencies in the training of doctors. We 
have not been trained to dispense information. Doctors do not 
give patients birth control instructions even during the 
abortion treatment," says Varvas.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorma Rotko: "Swine Fever Killed Thousands of </F>
Estonian Swine -- Over 200 Carcasses in Quarantine, No Danger to 
Humans From the Disease"] 
  [Text] The swine disease ravaging one farm in Valuste in 
the Jarvenmaa region of Estonia has been confirmed to be swine 
fever in an analysis conducted in a laboratory in Tartu. The 
disease has caused more damage than feared, since over 1,000 
swine have died of it. Animals that may have been carrying swine 
fever have also been sent to be slaughtered. 
  At the Rakvere meat combine there are 207 swine carcasses in 
quarantine that are to be inspected before use to prevent the 
spread of swine fever. 
  Swine fever does not present any danger to humans or house 
pets, but both may be carriers of the dangerous disease. The 
origin of the swine fever in Valuste is not known. One 
hypothesis is that it came from Poland, where the disease is 
prevalent. In Estonia it occurred a previous time in 1962. 
  It is reported from the large farm in Valuste, which is 
organized in the form of a corporation, that the disease 
symptoms were discovered back at the beginning of December, but 
it was not possible at that time to determine that it was swine 
fever. 
  Suspicions were aroused when the swine began to die. At the 
beginning of December there were about 2,200 swine, and on 
Thursday [27 January] only 360 [figures as published] were left. 
Of course, part of the swine had been sold. On Wednesday [26 
January] 15 swine died and were buried using a power shovel. 
  The Estonians fear that swine fever may spread. Pork is 
continually sold by the farm to persons residing in the region. 
The farm is a former collective farm, and its employees also 
have their own swine, which are obviously in danger of contagion. 
  Fresh meat may not be imported into Finland from Estonia, 
but 
at the Tallinn market, at least, a lot of it is sold to Finns. 
Sausage that is not fully cooked may also contain pathogenic 
agents, since eliminating them from the meat requires boiling 
for two hours.

<F P=106> [Article by Colin Randall in Belfast: "Hepatitis Check for </F>
100,000 Mothers"] 
  [Text] At least 100,000 women are being offered blood tests 
for hepatitis C after the Irish Republic's blood transfusion 
service discovered they could be at risk from contaminated blood 
products used over a period of 21 years. 
  Thousands of mothers swamped call lines yesterday amid fears 
that some could have contracted the virus from anti-D 
immunoglobulin injected between 1970 and 1991 to women about to 
give birth to babies of a different blood group. 
  The nationwide screening programme was announced after the 
Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board's discovery that an 
infected batch produced in 1977 could be responsible for 
hepatitis anti-bodies found recently in a small number of female 
blood donors who had given birth during that year. 
  Dr. Terry Walsh, the board's chief medical officer, said 
yesterday that all the women were clinically well and that the 
total number of infected women was likely to be very low. "It is 
important to say that there is no panic but there is a need for 
concern," he said. "Otherwise we would not be carrying out the 
screening." 
  Anti-D product has been given to rhesus negative women 
expecting rhesus positive children since 1970 to protect the 
unborn babies from haemolytic disease, which can cause 
stillbirth, brain damage or severe anaemia. 
  About 7,000 rhesus negative women in Ireland now receive the 
treatment, regarded as a valuable pregnancy aid that is 
estimated to save as many as 100 babies in the country each year. 
  Hepatitis C can cause jaundice or, in the most extreme 
cases, 
potentially fatal liver disease in later life. 
  However, medical experts in the Republic believe that most 
women affected by contaminated anti-D would be likely to suffer 
benign liver inflammation at worse. 
  The blood transfusion service's discovery of hepatitis C 
antibodies in blood donors was made last month by its Cork 
regional director, Dr. Joan Power. 
  She said that while women who gave birth in 1977 were the 
focus of the screening programme, the board wished to ensure 
there was no risk at other times. 
  The source of the contamination has not yet been identified 
but Dr. Power stressed that the product concerned was not 
administered to any women outside Ireland.

<F P=106> [Article by freelance journalist Inger Sundelin: "Businesses </F>
Develop HIV Policy"] 
  [Text] When the first AIDS cases were reported at the 
beginning of the 1980's, HIV and AIDS were unknown phenomena for 
most of us. Today, after a great many information campaigns, 
newspaper articles, and TV and radio programs, hardly anyone has 
escaped hearing about the HIV virus and the immune deficiency 
disease, AIDS. A new HIV-infected person is found in Sweden 
every day and the number of infected people is approaching 
4,000. The likelihood that someone at a place of work may be 
infected is increasing all the time. 
  In the beginning, business executives were at a loss when 
one 
of their employees turned out to be HIV-positive. Today things 
are different and more and more businesses are now drawing up 
action programs for these problems. One of the first businesses 
to produce an HIV policy was Volvo. 
<H5>  Everyone Informed </H5>
  "We made a move very early. Back at the beginning of the 
1980's Leif Wallin, who was the corporation physician at that 
time, advocated spreading information about HIV and AIDS," said 
Lennart Dimberg, company physician at Volvo Airplane Engines in 
Tollhattan and former corporation physician. 
  Volvo issued easily understandable written information to 
all 
its employees. With the help of comic strips everyone was 
informed about what HIV and AIDS are, how the infection is 
spread and how it is not. It is at least as important to tell 
people about the latter as it is to describe the actual methods 
of infection. 
  The Volvo corporation has decided that HIV should not be a 
reason to refuse to allow people to work for Volvo. 
  "I have taken part in hiring HIV-positive people," Dimberg 
went on. However the company advises employees not to tell 
fellow workers and job supervisors that they have HIV. 
  "They tell us in the company health care system, that is 
enough," said Dimberg. "People don't tell everybody if they have 
hepatitis, syphilis, or any other disease, so why talk about 
HIV?" 
  There is a risk that complications will arise and rumors 
will 
spread and that the infected person will not get any of the 
support and security from the job group that he or she needs. 
  "Anxiety is the big problem, not infection," Dimberg said. 
  SCA [Swedish Cellulose Company] is another company that has 
a 
policy on this problem. It was produced after company executives 
received an inquiry from their employees abroad in the 
mid-1980's about what preparations they had for HIV/AIDS. 
  "We had none at all, so we appointed a working group that 
included union people, corporate executives and members of the 
safety committee and assigned them the task of coming up with a 
policy," said Rolf Gatugard, chief safety adviser at SCA 
Ortviken, Inc. 
<H5>  Test Not Required </H5>
  SCA does not require that employees be tested for HIV, 
whether this involves new job applicants or existing personnel. 
However the company does recommend that all employees who work 
abroad be tested both before and after their trip. 
  "The group discussed whether or not an infected person 
should 
tell his or her fellow workers. We reached the conclusion that 
it should be a matter between the doctor and the infected 
person," Gatugard said. "If someone tells, there is a big risk 
that it will create a lot of anxiety among fellow workers and 
they may reject the infected person instead of providing 
support." 
  SAS [Scandinavian Airlines] has no formal HIV policy. 
However 
the corporation has produced some internal guidelines that the 
company health care system follows. We were told this by Anders 
Huss, one of the company physicians at SAS. SAS employees are 
not tested, whether they are new employees or existing 
personnel. With one exception: pilot training applicants must be 
tested for HIV. It is an important goal not to give people with 
HIV infection special treatment. 
  "I do not feel that it is of any importance from the 
company's point of view that an employee is a symptom-free 
carrier of the HIV virus." 
  There is no reason to dismiss or reassign anyone because he 
or she represents a risk of infection to others, Huss said. 
  "On the other hand there may be good reason to consider 
reassignment to protect infection-prone HIV-positive workers who 
have a lot of contact with customers in their work and are thus 
exposed to a risk of infection themselves. The goal is to move 
them to a less exposed job." 
  SAS applies the same principles to HIV as it does to any 
other disease when it comes to reassignment and sick leave on a 
full-time or part-time basis. The deciding factor is the 
person's ability to work in relation to the job requirements. 
  There is no single answer to the question of whether 
infected 
people should tell their fellow workers or not, Huss feels. They 
must decide this for themselves. 
  "Personally I usually advise those who are unsure not to 
tell. The people around them may be frightened and the result 
can be that the HIV-infected person is rejected by the group 
instead of receiving support." Huss thinks that the "hysteria" 
surrounding HIV has largely disappeared. 
  Like SCA, SAS recommends that its employees be tested before 
and after working abroad. In addition the company has placed 
"emergency kits" containing intravenous drip units, needles, and 
syringes in all the places around the world where SAS personnel 
are stationed.

<F P=106> [Article by David Fletcher, health services correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Surgeons in more than four out of 10 hospitals have 
been told to slow down the number of operations they perform 
because their hospital is running out of money, the Royal 
College of Surgeons said yesterday. 
  It said its survey of 234 surgeons in all areas of the 
country found widespread reductions in routine operations and 
cuts in the number of out-patients being seen. 
  The same happened a year ago. "None of the contract-related 
financial problems of last year appears to have been resolved," 
the college said. 
  The survey found that general surgery was worst affected, 
with 30 percent of hospitals slowing down operations, followed 
by orthopaedics (26 percent), urology (26) and ear, nose and 
throat treatment (12). 
  As a result, the number of patients waiting for treatment 
has 
increased in more than half of all general surgical departments 
and in four out of 10 orthopaedic departments. The survey 
confirmed previous findings that hospitals are increasingly 
giving preference to patients referred by fund-holding GP's, who 
have the money to pay for their treatment. 
  Some had also been told to treat more "extra-contractual 
referrals" -- patients sent by other health districts which had 
agreed to pay the cost. 
  Prof. Norman Browse, professor of surgery at St Thomas' 
Hospital and president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said 
the college considered that patients should be treated according 
to clinical priority, not financial criteria. 
  The Health Department said that health authorities had to 
decide the priorities in allocating cash between primary care, 
non-urgent surgery and community care. 
  "There is an extra &pound;1.6 billion available for health 
care 
next year and we would like to see doctors more involved in the 
process of deciding those priorities."

<F P=106> [Article by Victoria Macdonald: "Chance To End Hepatitis B </F>
Deaths `Ignored'"] 
  [Text] The Government is resisting expert advice and a 
recommendation from the World Health Organisation to introduce a 
national immunisation programme against hepatitis B, a virus 
1,000 times more infectious than AIDS. 
  Health ministers claim the incidence is too low to be of 
significance, even though it kills one in five carriers and more 
than 600 people a year die of it in Britain. 
  In response to a written question from Dawn Primarolo, 
Labour 
health spokesman, Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said 
last week: "Immunisation strategy is kept under review." 
  But sources at the health department said ministers were 
concerned at the cost of such a programme. 
  The WHO first recommended national immunisation in 1991 and 
this was endorsed by the World Health Assembly the following 
year. 
  Experts in Britain have told the health department that an 
immunisation programme targeting infants or teenagers -- or both 
-- could effectively wipe out the virus. They have also called 
for more effective notification of the disease because they fear 
it is being vastly under-reported. 
  The United States, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore and 
Canada are among countries that have already followed the 
recommendations. 
  Professor Arie Zuckerman, of the Royal Free Hospital, an 
adviser on viral diseases to the health department and the WHO, 
said last week: "This is an infection which is preventable. It 
is also a very important public health issue." 
  Like AIDS, hepatitis B is transmitted sexually or by 
infected 
blood or contaminated medical instruments. The WHO estimates 
that one in 20 people in Europe alone have or have had the 
virus. But Prof. Zuckerman said the problem here was the lack of 
epidemiological data. 
  "The official view is based on the notification rates to the 
Public Health Laboratory Service. But I do not buy that, because 
in most cases the symptoms are not recognised and not all cases 
are reported," he said. 
  It could affect 15 to 20 per cent of the population rather 
than the less than one per cent cited by the health department. 
  "Eradicating hepatitis B by immunisation is an achievable 
target and the UK should participate in the WHO programme," 
Prof. Zuckerman said. 
  "If you compare the costs of treatment with prevention, then 
there is no question about which is cheaper."

<F P=106> [Article by David Brown, agriculture correspondent: "AIDS </F>
Virus Cattle Sent for Slaughter"] 
  [Text] Three cattle from a Cheshire herd have been sent for 
slaughter after an AIDS-related virus was found. 
  However the meat is safe to eat, the Ministry of Agriculture 
said yesterday. 
  Farmer David Blything, of Green Lane Farm, Kelso, where 
traces of bovine immuno deficienco virus (BIV) have been found 
in at least two animals, said yesterday that the meat was likely 
to be made into mince or beefburgers. 
  Mr. Jim Jack, solicitor for Mr. Blything, said last night 
one 
of the cattle was sold for slaughter before tests showed it 
contained BIV antibodies. 
  A second animal, which tested positive, had also been sent 
for slaughter as had a third from the herd which had not shown 
signs of antibodies. 
  BIV is a distant relative of HIV virus in humans, but the 
ministry said there was no risk to public health. 
  It originated in the United States and was first discovered 
in Britain in 1990. 
  -- Pig farmers were facing a serious economic crisis, Mr. 
David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said at 
its annual meeting in London yesterday. 
  An urgent message had been sent by him to Mr. Renee 
Steichen, 
EC farm commissioner, urging him to speed up an inquiry into 
state aid given to French pig producers. 
  The NFU says that the state aid puts the British producers 
at 
a competitive disadvantage.

<F P=106> [Article by Inger Atterstam: "200,000 To Be Vaccinated </F>
Against Diphtheria"] 
  [Text] An extensive program to vaccinate special risk 
groups in Sweden against diphtheria is being initiated by the 
appropriate Swedish authorities. In all, close to 200,000 Swedes 
are expected to be candidates for vaccination. 
  The reason for this action is a fast-growing diphtheria 
epidemic primarily in Russia, but also in the Baltic states. 
  "The development in Russia has caused us to analyze the 
situation regarding protection against diphtheria in Sweden and 
propose vaccination of specially exposed risk persons," says 
professor Hans Wigzell, head of the Institute for Protection 
Against Contagious Diseases in Solna. 
<H5>  Customs People and Police </H5>
  The groups being considered for vaccination are persons who 
come in contact with persons from Russia and the Baltic states. 
This involves customs, police and Coast Guard personnel, as well 
as employees at refugee centers, ferry personnel and persons who 
travel frequently in these countries, for example truck drivers. 
  Responsible for the package of measures, in addition to the 
Institute for Protection Against Contagious Diseases, are also 
the Social Administration and the Occupational Health 
Administration. 
  The diphtheria epidemic in Russia started in 1992 mainly in 
a 
few large Russian cities, and then spread to the entire country. 
In 1992, 3,897 cases of diphtheria were reported in Russia, and 
by October 1993, 9,923 cases, 2,756 of which were children. 
Three hundred deaths are known in Russia. 
<H5>  Lower Incidence </H5>
  In the Baltic states the incidence is still somewhat lower, 
but in 1993 between five and ten cases were recorded in these 
countries. 
  "It is an extremely worrying development in these 
countries," 
says Thomas Linglof, a physician at the epidemiology department 
of the Contagious Diseases Institute. He has visited the 
countries in question in order to study the development. 
  "A major problem is partly that access to vaccine is poor in 
these countries, and partly that people mistrust vaccination. It 
is mostly due to their fear of becoming infected from unclean 
syringes. 
  In Finland as well four cases of diphtheria occurred in 
1993, 
and that has led to the Finnish authorities to recommend that 
all persons over 40 should be vaccinated against diphtheria. 
  "There is no reason to do anything similar in Sweden," says 
Hans Wigzell. "Such a mass vaccination has more disadvantages 
than advantages; among other things, it implies a risk of side 
effects and becomes tremendously expensive." 
<H5>  Close Contacts </H5>
  The evaluation of the Contagious Diseases Institute is that 
Sweden does not face a threat of a diphtheria epidemic. 
  "But with the close contacts that exist between our 
countries, there is major risk that we could get a small number 
of cases," says Thomas Linglof. 
  Diphtheria is caused by a bacterium and can cause difficult, 
often lethal, throat infections as well as cardiac and nervous 
symptoms. 
  All Swedes born in 1955 and later have been vaccinated 
against diphtheria, while those persons who were born before 
vaccination was introduced have poorer protection against the 
disease. According to certain studies, as many as 80 percent of 
Swedes over 40 have no defense against diphtheria. 
<H5>  Outbreak Among Derelicts </H5>
  During 1984-86 a noted outbreak of diphtheria occurred among 
derelict alcoholics in Goteborg, resulting in, among other 
things, a large number of people being vaccinated. 
  "That time the diphtheria never spread outside the groups 
initially affected," says Hans Wigzell. "This shows that we 
nevertheless have good protection against diphtheria in Sweden 
and there is no reason for panic now either." 
  Persons who are to visit Russia or the Baltic states are 
advised to have themselves vaccinated against diphtheria, and 
health care personnel are called on to detect and carefully 
analyze all cases of unclear throat infections.

by country and disease. Source follows each item. 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  Dysentery -- "The outbreak of dysentery that has affected 
Cabo Delgado Province since the end of the first half of 1993 
caused 51 deaths by the end of February. Reports from Cabo 
Delgado say that the outbreak has already affected all districts 
of the province with the exception of Ibo Islands. A total of 
4,027 cases were recorded by February." (Maputo Radio Mozambique 
Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 13 Mar 94) 
<H5>  South Africa </H5>
  AIDS -- "3,071 AIDS cases have been reported in South Africa 
since the epidemic started in 1983, and 1,188 cases were 
diagnosed last year, the Department of National Health said on 
Friday. AIDS was still under-reported, a statement said. Adult 
AIDS cases doubled in 1993, from 527 in 1992 to 1,062. 
Paediatric AIDS was probably the worst-reported category. Only 
half these cases were reported last year (104), compared to 
(211) the previous year. Sexual transmission of AIDS accounted 
for almost 80 per cent (2,435) of cases, and transmission from 
mother to child accounted for 16 per cent (481) of cases. Blood 
transfusions and blood products were the mode of transmission in 
1.5 per cent of cases. The mode of transmission was not stated 
in 3.5 per cent of AIDS reports, the statement said. To date 
only two patients have been reported who contracted the HIV 
virus through intravenous drug abuse." (Johannesburg SAPA in 
English 1336 GMT 11 Mar 94)

outbreaks of and reports on various diseases. Items are listed 
by country and disease. Source follows each item. 
<H5>  Botswana </H5>
  AIDS -- Health Minister Bahitik Temane says a large 
proportion of patients have been admitted in every Botswana 
hospital with AIDS-related illnesses. Presenting his ministry's 
budget to Parliament yesterday, Mr. Temane said in the future 
the country's health services might not be able to maintain 
standards, as more and more resources get swallowed up by 
AIDS-related services. He said alternative programs like 
home-based care are being developed, but prevention remains the 
best solution. (Gaborone Radio Botswana Network in English 1610 
GMT 18 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  Diarrhea -- One person is dead and other serious cases of 
bloody diarrhea were reported since it affected the Mahelane 
location of Changalane Administration Region in Maputo 
Province's Namaacha District. Between 30 and 40 patients 
suffering from bloody diarrhea are being treated at the 
Changalane Health Post. Nurse Helena Bila says the epidemic is 
spreading because the people are using water from the Changalane 
River without boiling it. (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in 
Portuguese 1030 GMT 14 Mar 94) 
  Dysentery -- A total of 25 people have died of dysentery in 
Gaza Province over the past two months. Medical superintendent 
Dr. Mario Marine said more than 6,500 cases of dysentery were 
registered during the same period. Chokwe District was the most 
affected with about 2,000 cases. Dr. Mario Marine said the 
disease is mostly caused by bad hygiene and the consumption of 
unclean water. (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 
1030 GMT 17 Mar 94) 
  Dysentery -- The MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY (AIM) has 
learned that two government soldiers died of dysentery at the 
Lichinga Assembly Area in the capital of Niassa Province last 
February. The provincial government has already sent medicine 
and health personnel to the assembly area and improved the 
soldiers'diet. (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 
1400 GMT 19 Mar 94) 
  Cholera -- "Cholera has been affecting Cabo Delgado Province 
since the end of last year and it has already caused six deaths. 
A total of 660 cases of cholera were diagnosed between January 
and February of this year. Meanwhile, dysentery killed another 
four people over the same period." (Maputo Radio Mozambique 
Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 15 Mar 94) 
  AIDS -- "Officials of the National Program Against AIDS have 
said they were frightened of the AIDS situation in Tete 
Province. AIDS has grown tremendously in that province. The 
team visited Tete Province's Changara, Cahora Bassa, and the 
provincial capital." (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in 
Protuguese 1030 GMT 16 mar 94) 
<H5>  Namibia </H5>
  Tuberculosis -- "The oldest and most primitive people in 
southern Africa, the San or Bushmen of Namibia, are being 
threatened by a tuberculosis epidemic." Dr. Hans Nel, district 
surgeon for Gobabis, reports: "It is approximately the highest 
prevalence rate of tuberculosis right now in the world. When we 
started this study there were only 18 cases that we knew of that 
were positive for tuberculosis. At the end of one year's study 
and follow-up study there were 385 cases, which meant that there 
was quite a large percentage of positive cases identified." "It 
can pose a threat to the elimination of the Bushmen as a whole, 
especially the fact that they are a small group in a community, 
grouped together in a certain area in Namibia." (Johannesburg 
Channel Africa Radio in English 1100 GMT 17 Mar 94) 
  Meningitis -- Josef Mothina writes that "mass immunisation 
against the worst outbreak of meningitis in Namibia in 10 years 
is to start this week. So far at least 150 cases of the killer 
disease have been reported countrywide. Since the end of 
January, when the first cases of the disease were reported, 69 
cases have occurred in the south; 52 in Katutura and seven in 
the Otjozondjupa region." (Windhoek THE NAMIBIAN in English 14 
Mar 94 pp 1, 2) 
<H5>  South Africa </H5>
  New TB Strain -- Kathryn Strachan reports that "a new 
multidrug- resistant strain of tuberculosis is emerging in South 
Africa, with about 2 percent of TB [tuberculosis] cases proving 
resistant to treatment." At the Tuberculosis Beyond 2000 
conference in Pretoria on 14 March, Medical Research Council 
spokesman Dr. Karin Weyer said "in the U.S., HIV infection had 
been associated with outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB. This 
was cause for concern for SA, as the incidence of HIV was 
increasing. However, while nearly all multidrug-resistant TB 
patients in the U.S. were HIV positive, in SA the proportion was 
only about 3 percent. Local estimates of multidrug-resistant TB 
were low." (Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 15 Mar 94 p 2) 
<H5>  Zimbabwe </H5>
  AIDS -- The cumulative number of AIDS cases is estimated to 
rise to more than 130,000 by the end of this year, according to 
the National AIDS Coordination Program. There were more than 
30,000 estimated new cases of AIDS in 1993. At the moment, 
however, there are only 28,000 full-blown AIDS cases. (Harare

<H5>  Lesotho </H5>
  TB -- "The Mafiteng district has been rated second after 
Maseru in the number of tuberculosis, TB, cases. Addressing a 
gathering to mark the World Tuberculosis Day in Mafiteng this 
week, the honorable minister of health and social welfare, Dr. 
Khauhelo Ralitapole, said an average of 400 TB cases were 
treated at the Mafiteng government hospital every year." An 
estimated 50 percent of all patients at hospitals in the country 
suffered from TB. A TB specialist in the ministry of health, Dr. 
Brenda Cochrane, warned that "the TB virus was one of the major 
causes of death in Lesotho. The most common was TB of the lungs 
in both men and women." (Maseru Radio Lesotho in English 1130 
GMT 27 Mar 94) 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  AIDS -- More than 800 AIDS cases have been diagnosed in this 
country over the last five years. NOTICIAS newspaper reports

in Portuguese 0800 GMT 22 Mar 94) 
  AIDS -- The weekly DOMINGO newspaper reports today that 
150,000 people are infected with the AIDS virus in Mozambique. 
The newspaper was quoting Dr. (Agostinho Barreto), director of 
the national program for fighting AIDS and sexually transmitted 
diseases. Noting that the estimated figure applies to December 
of last year, Dr. (Barreto) added that it is far from reflecting 
the truth because the country does not have the right equipment 
to carry out accurate diagnosis. He also said that AIDS is 
growing fastest in central Manica, Sofala, and Tete Provinces, 
which account for 55 percent of all AIDS cases in the country. 
(Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 0800 GMT 27 Mar 
94) 
  TB -- The Cabo Delgado health authorities say "860 cases of 
tuberculosis were diagnosed in 1993. Of that figure, 309 cases 
were reported in urban centers of Montepuez and Pemba, and the 
remainder in rural areas. In 1993, 779 leprosy cases were 
reported in the same province." (Maputo Radio Mozambique 
Network in Portuguese 0800 GMT 23 Mar 94) 
  Diarrhea in Sofala -- "Diarrhea is reemerging in Beira, the 
capital of Sofala Province. Beira Hospital's cholera ward 
admitted 30 patients suffering from that ailment during the 
first 10 days of this month. One of those patients has died." 
(Maputo NOTICIAS in Portuguese 18 Mar 94 p 3) 
  Diarrhea in Gaza -- "Some 360 cases of diarrhea with traces 
of blood have been reported in Gaza Province's Chibuto District 
since March 1993." The health director for Chibuto District 
said that an average of five to six people are diagnosed with 
that ailment every week. There have been no deaths so far. 
(Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1030 GMT 26 Mar 
94) 
  Dysentery in Manica -- The epidemic which broke out in 
Manica 
Province early last year continues to be a threat to public 
health, with the number of cases growing considerably in Chimoio 
and in other districts of Manica Province. By the end of last 
year, the epidemic had killed 27 people, out of 8,966 cases 
reported. (Maputo NOTICIAS in Portuguese 18 Mar 94 p 3) 
  Dysentery in Gaza -- At least 25 people have died of 
dysentery in Gaza Province over the past year. The province 
also registered more than 6,500 cases of dysentery during this 
period. This was revealed by provincial chief doctor Mario 
Marize. Dr. Marize said the most affected district is Chokwe, 
with about 2,000 cases, followed by Chicualacuala and Guija. 
(Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1730 GMT 24 Mar

<H5>  Namibia </H5>
  Malaria -- "According to statistics from the Kavango and 
Caprivi regions, at least 191,206 malaria cases, with 134 
deaths, have been reported since last year in the northeast of 
Namibia." According to the 1993 annual medical report more than 
60,000 of all outpatients were under the age of five. Nearly 
6,000 adults, with 53 deaths, were admitted to hospitals last 
year with malaria. This year 434 adults were admitted to 
hospital, with four deaths recorded. Of the 7,356 children 
admitted to hospitals with malaria in 1993, 75 died. Since the 
beginning of this year 559 children have already been admitted, 
2 died. (Windhoek DIE REPUBLIKEIN in Afrikaans 17 Mar 94 p 5) 
  Meningitis -- "Altogether 257 cases of meningitis, with 18 
deaths recorded, have been reported countrywide since the 
beginning of the year. Most cases occurred in the Windhoek 
district. Meningitis vaccine arrived in Namibia yesterday from 
the Pasteur Institute in France." (Windhoek DIE REPUBLIKEIN in 
Afrikaans 18 Mar 94 p 1) 
<H5>  Swaziland </H5>
  Malaria -- "At least six people had been killed by malaria 
in 
Lubombo -- four of them this month alone." A spokesman for the 
Malaria Control Unit said the malaria outbreak started "early 
this year with two people killed last month and four this 
month." (Mbabane THE SWAZI OBSERVER in English 24 Mar 94 p 1)

from rivers and lakes is the reason for the epidemic which is 
causing an average of 15 to 20 deaths per day, AZAP stated. The 
epidemic spreads very quickly because of inadequate means to 
fight it, and because of the almost total lack of drugs, AZAP 
added. It has now affected the six localities of Malemba-Nkulu 
Zone, AZAP said without giving the exact number of victims.

  [Text] Yamoussoukro, 13 March (PANA) -- African countries 
must increase immunisation of their children beyond present 
levels if child killer diseases are to be eradicated quickly, 
participants at the Fourth International Seminar on 
Immunisations in Africa said Sunday [13 March] in Yamoussoukro, 
the Ivorian capital. 
  "Individual governments have to increase their input and 
intensify community involvement in the vaccination programmes," 
said Kebba Jobe, a Gambian participant, said. Speaking before 
the start of the seminar Jobe, who manages his country's 
expanded programme on immunization, said the Gambia had attained 
69 percent immunisation for children aged below one year. He 
said donors must continue supporting Gambia to reduce the cost 
of vaccines and thereby increase the percentage of immunisation. 
  A Mauritanian delegate, Dr. Pradbodh Munbodh, said managers 
of immunisation programmes in Africa should adopt private sector 
working methods to reduce bureaucracy. He told delegates from 
South Africa that by 1992, Mauritania had attained vaccination 
of between 75 and 80 percent of all pregnant women, 85 percent 
of children against measles and 90 percent against diphteria, 
whooping cough and tetanus. "Since you face an enourmous 
vaccination task in your country, the best thing is to motivate 
the paramedical personnel directly involved in the field," he 
told Ray Mabope, the African National Congress' (ANC) national 
chair on vaccination and immunisation and Bonginkosi Mhlanga of 
the Pan-Africanist Congress' (PAC) health directorate. Mabope 
said that with its three vaccine manufacturing institutions, 
South Africa should be able to vaccinate all its children within 
the next few years and become a vaccine supplier to countries in 
the southern African development community. 
  This, he said, would entail rationalising the activities of 
the South African Institute for Medical Research, the State 
Vaccine Institute and the National Institute of Virology "to cut 
down wastage." 
  Mhlanga said that although the South African Government 
claimed it had achieved 80 percent immunisation of its children, 
"we have to unify the country first before analysing the 
situation in South Africa, especially in the homelands, where 
the situation is not clear." South Africa is due to form its 
first democratic government after the country's first non-racial 
elections on 26-28 April. 
  The four-day seminar, which has attracted vaccination 
experts 
from Africa, Europe and the United States, is to be opened later 
today by Cote d'Ivoire's health minister, Maurice Guikahue. The 
theme is: "To build a durable partnership for immunisations for 
Africa." It is the fourth of its kind, after those of Bamako in 
1974, Dakar in 1981 and Niamey in 1987. 
  South Africa, which is taking part for the first time, is 
represented by an eight-person multiracial delegation, including 
representatives of government and the former liberation 
movements -- ANC and PAC.

  [Excerpt] Dr. William Shija, minister for information and 
broadcasting, has urged newsmen in the country to consider ways 
of educating the public on reasons that stifle the campaign 
against AIDS. Honorable Shija made the call while opening a 
week's seminar for mass media institutions on AIDS at Kibaha 
today. 
  In his speech, which was read on his behalf by the director 
of the Department of Information, Ndugu Bwire Musarika, the 
minister said that recent figures indicated that Tanzania had 
many more AIDS patients than other East African countries. He 
said that according to the figures cases of AIDS had increased 
rapidly in the country during the last three years. He added 
that the alarming spread of AIDS in the country called for new 
strategies in combating the disease, including use of the mass 
media. 
  Hon. Shija said abject poverty, over-population in towns, 
and 
frequent family squabbles had greatly contributed to the spread 
of AIDS in many African countries. He called on journalists to 
be composed while filing reports on AIDS without being alarmist 
but to file reports which contained a message on ways of 
controlling the spread of the disease. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Poliovirus (PV) is the main etiological agent of 
paralytic poliomyelitis. A recombinant of PV1 was identified 
during the molecular epidemiological survey by using sequence 
analysis of the genomic PV1/2A junction region (residues 
3296-3445). The PV1 isolates were tested at the beginning by 
Sabin 1-specific PCR and Dot hybridization and was excluded from 
vaccine-related PV1. Its sequencing data of the 150 nucleotides 
shared 97 percent homology to Sabin 1. Expanded sequencing of 
its 5'-side revealed many nucleotide substitutions identical to 
those of wild PV1 from residue 3262 upward, which indicates the 
recombination site at residues 3262/3263 junction. Fourteen of 
57 PV1 isolates collected from 13 provinces or autonomous 
regions were found to be recombinant by a recombinant-specific 
PCR developed by us. The high sequence similarity among them 
suggests that these 14 PV1 isolates probably were the progeny of 
a recombinant produced by a patient dually infected by wild and 
Sabin 1. Studies of virulence, immunogenicity, transmissibility, 
etc. of this recombinant are going on.

  [Text] Aedes albopictus and Ae. 
aegypti mosquitoes were tested for their ability for 
transovarial transmission of chikungunya (CHIK) virus. The 
strains of CHIK virus employed for B8635, M81 and Ross isolated 
from Yunnan, China or Africa. Studies showed that these two 
species of mosquitoes were capable of transmitting CHIK virus by 
bite to susceptible hosts. Parental females of Ae. 
albopictus and Ae. aegypti were infected orally 
with CHIK virus, and 3070 first generation progeny from infected 
mothers were pooled into 55 pools and examined for the virus. 
Positive rate of pools from Ae. albopictus were 46.15 
percent (6/13) for larvae, 33.33 percent (4/12) for adult 
females and 62.50 percent (5/8) for adult males. Positive rate 
of pools from Ae. aegypti were 18.18 percent (2/11) 
for larvae and 22.22 percent (2/9) for adult females. In another 
experiment, CHIK viruses were detected in second and third 
generations progeny obtained from individual infected Ae. 
albopictus and Ae. aegypti. Based on these 
studies, infected females were capable of transmitting the virus 
vertically to their offspring. There was no apparent difference 
in transovarial transmission capabilities of these two species 
in orally infected mosquitoes. These results indicate that 
Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti have the 
potential to play a role in the maintenance of CHIK virus in 
nature.

  [Text] During April-May 1991, by using SAT, CFT, and 
Coomb's methods an epidemiological surveillance on brucellosis 
among human beings and animals in some villages and pasturelands 
of Su Nan County was conducted. The results were that the serum 
brucella antibody was found positive in 61 cases (19.06 percent 
out of 320 human beings) and 49 cases were diagnosed as 
brucellosis. An investigation on 497 cattle and 1989 sheep with 
SAT methods was also made. The result showed that 15 sera 
showing a positive reaction all came from sheep. The rate was 
0.75 percent.

  [Text] Twenty-four strains of poliovirus type 1 isolated in 
12 different provinces in China were sequenced in the VP1/2A 
region (150 nucleotides) by the dideoxy chain termination 
method. After comparing these sequences with the Sabin 1 
reference strain and with 15 strains from province Taiwan and 
other neighboring countries using the gene alignment program 
from the PCGene, two dendrograms were constructed. We found six 
independent genotypes among the Chinese viruses and 14 genotypes 
among the world viruses. This interesting finding strongly 
suggested that there were molecular epidemiological 
relationships among viruses from China and other countries.

  [Text] Thailand will cooperate with Laos and Cambodia to 
prevent and solve the spread of AIDS, which follows the growth 
of tourism in the region. 
  Michai Wirawaithaya, a former Thai cabinet official and 
anti-AIDS activist, said in Phnom Penh that AIDS poses a threat 
to Cambodia and is comparable to a big time bomb that will cause 
a tragedy if the Cambodian Government ignores its spread. 
Citing Thailand as an example, Michai said recognition of 
reality and of the importance of preventing AIDS will lead to a 
successful remedy of the problem. The successful Thai campaign 
to inform the public about AIDS prevention has reduced the 
contraction of AIDS in Thailand from 1,200 to 600 cases daily, 
or 50 percent prevention effectiveness. Michai plans to invite 
members of the Cambodian Government's National AIDS Prevention 
Committee to observe AIDS prevention efforts and the final 
stages of AIDS infection cases in Thailand. 
  On cooperation with Laos, Dr. Siriwat Thiptharawadon, the 
Nong Khai Province public health officer, said that in order to 
cope with contagious diseases -- including AIDS -- that will 
follow the increased convenience of travel between Thailand and 
Laos after the April opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, 
Nong Khai Province will stage a medical and public health 
seminar with 75 Thai and Lao officials concerned with the 
control of contagious diseases. The seminar is aimed at 
formulating suggestions, ways, and plans to combat contagious 
diseases along the Thai-Lao border, particularly after the 
opening of the Friendship Bridge. It is also aimed at 
increasing understanding among these officials in control of 
contagious diseases and effecting coordination between the two 
countries in case of epidemics.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Almost 20 percent of 
public health centers, the nation's front-line defense against 
AIDS, do not know what hospitals they can refer AIDS patients 
to, a health ministry report released Wednesday [16 March] said. 
  The report said the figure indicates that the Health and 
Welfare Ministry's attempt to encourage a nationwide system of 
base hospitals as a key element of its anti-AIDS strategy is 
still incomplete. 
  A ministry team studying the epidemiology of AIDS made the 
finding after compiling results from 688 responses received by 
mid-January to questionnaires sent out in November to the 848 
centers. 
  The ministry found that 688 centers or 81 percent of the 
total responded to the survey. Of the respondents, 675 or 98 
percent offered an AIDS-related telephone inquiry service and 
633, or 92 percent, offered AIDS-related interviews. 
  But the ministry said only 555, or 81 percent, of the 
centers 
knew of hospitals to which they could refer AIDS patients or 
people who were infected with the AIDS-causing human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
  The ministry has requested each prefecture to stipulate at 
least two hospitals which can serve as centers for the treatment 
of AIDS but by late January only four prefectures had complied.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 17 KYODO -- Japan will have a 
relatively low 18,000 persons with AIDS and the AIDS-causing 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by 2002, a Health and Welfare 
Ministry team studying the epidemiology of AIDS said Thursday 
[17 March]. 
  The number is low compared to the United States which 
already 
has 340,000 patients with full-blown AIDS and where one person 
in 200 is estimated to either have AIDS or is HIV positive. 
  The team said their forecast is lower than original 
estimates. 
  It would mean that by early next century only one in every 
7,000 people in Japan would have AIDS or be HIV positive. 
  Mitsuhiro Kamakura, a member of the team who lectures at 
Keio 
University's school of medicine, attributed the low forecast in 
part to what he said was Japan's high average standard of 
education, and its low numbers of homosexuals and drug users. 
  The team's findings will be announced in detail at a meeting 
of the Japanese Society for Hygiene in Kanazawa from April 6. 
  In late 1993, the ministry's AIDS Surveillance Committee 
said 
Japan had 1,410 known HIV-positive and AIDS patients, excluding 
those infected through tainted blood transfusions, but that the 
real figure could be nine times as high. 
  In July last year, the committee also predicted some 26,000 
HIV-positive and AIDS patients in Japan by 1998. 
  The revised estimate was reached after consulting 80 experts 
on all aspects of AIDS. The estimate also takes account of the 
probability of the development of an AIDS vaccine. 
  The estimate for 2000 includes about 3,100 AIDS patients and 
about 14,700 persons who are HIV positive. 
  The committee said there is a 52.6 percent chance of a 
viable 
AIDS vaccine by 2005.

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- New technology 
researches to improve medical services are brisk among the 
medical workers of Korea. During the past one year, many 
inventions and rationalization proposals have been produced in 
the prophylactic and therapheutic organs in Pyongyang. More 
than [word indistinct] of them have been introduced into clinics. 
  One of the noteworthy successes is the separation and 
culture of pylorus spirillum, a main causer of gastric and [word 
indistinct] ulcers, and the development of a new Koryo medicine 
of big effect in treating them. 
  New technologies introduced in the treatment of liver [word 
indistinct] hypertension portails and acute pneumonia and a 
special method of suture for preventing suppuration in operation 
are also effective in clinical practice. 
  Soft cupping and water-eczema and massage appliances also 
have won the favor of the patients. 
  Medical workers, while giving preventive and curative 
assistance to working people, write many valuable medical 
treatises. They total ten and several thousand annually 
nationwide. 
  Scientific symposiums on the researches of medical workers 
are regularly held. 
  The active efforts of the medical workers reliably guarantee 
the health of the working people.

  [Text] Port Moresby, March 23 (AFP) -- Doctors have gone to 
the isolated Trobriand Islands northeast of here to investigate 
reports that more than 200 people have died from a malaria 
outbreak, Papua New Guinea (PNG) officials said Wednesday. 
  National disaster and emergency chief Leith Anderson said 
hundreds more were reportedly seriously ill. 
  He said communications from Trobriand were poor, but 
information reaching his office Tuesday said the epidemic had 
killed more than 200 men, women and children in the past two 
months -- with the old and very young hardest hit. 
  Anderson said the epidemic appeared to have hit Kiriwina -- 
the main island -- and the Kaileuna, Vakuta and Kitava island 
groups. 
  The Trobriands are about 400 kilometers (240 miles) 
northeast 
of here.

<F P=106> [Article by J. Esplanada and C. Avendano] </F>
  [Text] AIDS has spread to 25 cities and provinces in the 
country, Health Secretary Juan Flavier disclosed yesterday. 
  In a press briefing in Malacanang [presidential office], 
Flavier said most of those affected are in Metro Manila, Angeles 
City and Olongapo City. 
  He also disclosed that two more Filipinos died of AIDS last 
month, bringing to 77 the number of recorded casualties since 
the mid-1980's. 
  Flavier did not identify the victims. He did not say either 
where they died. 
  The two reportedly died some time between 8 February this 
year, when the last previous AIDS death was reported, and 28 
February. 
  As of end-February, Flavier said the health department's 
AIDS/ Human Immunodeficiency Virus Registry had recorded 475 
individuals with HIV, the microorganism that causes AIDS and 
breaks down the human body's defenses against diseases. 
  Of that number, 125 became full-blown AIDS cases, with 77 
dying eventually. 
  Tens of thousands more Filipinos may have been infected with 
HIV but remain undocumented. 
  Flavier earlier estimated their number at 50,000. The basis 
for that estimate was not explained. 
  The health department has also said that, in 98 percent of 
recorded AIDS cases here, HIV was transmitted through blood 
transfusion, with sexual contact accounting for the remaining 2 
percent. 
  There is no known cure for AIDS. 
  But the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila has started using AZT, 
or azidothymidine, on HIV patients. 
  The drug widely used in the Untied States and other 
countries, reportedly slows down the virus' damage to the immune 
system. But it is known to produce side effects like severe 
headache and anemia. 
  The health department's AIDS unit, in the meantime, will 
conduct random AIDS test in New Bilibid Prisons in Muntinlupa in 
response to a request from the Department of Justice. 
  But Flavier said the test "will not be coercive" stressing 
he 
was "against mandatory testing because this will make those who 
are positive to go underground and it will be self-defeating." 
  Justice Franklin Drilon the other day sought "mandatory 
test" 
for 78 inmates at the penitentiary amid reports that a bar girl 
with HIV was providing sexual services to rich or influential 
prisoners there. 
  In Congress, Senator Freddie Webb, chair of the Senate 
special committee on AIDS, said mandatory tests would violate 
the prisoners' human rights and only contribute to the 
"hysteria, stigma, ignorance and misperception" associated with 
the disease. 
  On Drilon's statement that a person loses his civil and 
political rights upon his conviction, Webb asked: "Does a 
person also forfeit his rights as a human upon conviction?" 
  Instead of curbing AIDS at the penitentiary, Webb said 
forced 
tests just might encouraged its spread. 
  He cited the "window period," during which a person may have 
contracted HIV but will test negative because he has not yet 
developed antibodies against it. 
  It takes six months after sexual contact for the virus to 
show up in an AIDS test. 
  "Forced testing may only lead infected inmates who are HIV- 
negative to have a false sense of security," Webb said. 
[sentence as published] 
  In general, he said, mandatory testing could raise a scare 
that would force infected sex workers, homosexuals and other 
citizens to go underground, out of the reach of those who could 
help them. 
  Instead of forced test, he said, Bureau of Prisons Director 
Vicente Vinarao should "do his job" of imposing discipline in 
the penitentiary to prevent irregularities and malpractice. 
  In a related development, the Senate approved Monday night a 
bill promoting voluntary blood donation and regulating the 
practice of "bloodbanking and transfusion medicine." 
  The bill is intended to help curb diseases transmitted 
through blood transfusion, such as AIDS, syphilis, hepatitis B 
and malaria. 
  It also aims to phase out commercial blood banks and 
establish a national voluntary blood donation program within 
three years of its implementation. 
  Dr. Dennis Maducdoc, chief of the health department's AIDS 
unit, said yesterday arrangements were being made with Vinarao 
and Bureau of Research and Laboratories Director Marietta Bacay 
for the random, voluntary testing of inmates by this week the 
earliest. 
  A second HIV antibody test will be given after six months 
taking into account the so-called window period. 
  The test detects the antibodies a person produces in 
response 
to the AIDS virus in his blood. 
  The health department, Maducdoc said, has a standing policy 
against compulsory HIV testing and prefers that a person submit 
himself to the test on his own free will. 
  Once a person decides to take the test, "we will go there 
and 
provide the services," he said. 
  In a news briefing, Maducdoc said testing of the inmates 
would give the health department an opportunity to find out for 
the first time "what is happening inside (the country's) jails." 
  He disclosed that the health department had received 
proposals from non-governmental organizations for financial 
assistance to an AIDS information and education program for the 
inmates. 
  "But this was not given priority for lack of funds," he 
said. 
  He promised, however, to recommend some of these proposals 
to 
an AIDS donors' meeting in June.

  [Text] Cebu City -- An unusually high number of typhoid 
fever cases has been reported in Metro Cebu and health officials 
are now conducting an epidemiological investigation to trace its 
source. 
  Assistant Regional Health Director Jose Rodriguez said the 
health department's disease surveillance center reported 28 
confirmed cases of typhoid fever admitted in at least six 
hospitals in the city. 
  Of the 28 confirmed cases, 11 are from Cebu City, eight from 
Lapulapu City, four from Mandaue City, one from Toledo City, and 
two each from Liloan and Talisay towns. 
  As this developed, Rodriguez said they have sent an 
epidemiological team to Cordova in Mactan Island to check 
reports that 18 people are suspected to have been afflicted by 
typhoid fever. 
  Rodriguez said that the number of typhoid cases for the 
period from January to middle of February is very much higher 
than that recorded for the same period last year. 
  Typhoid fever is caused by the fever-causing bacteria called 
"Salmonella typhi." Its symptoms, aside from fever, include 
headaches and abdominal pains. 
  Rodriguez said typhoid fever is dangerous in that, if not 
immediately detected and cured, could lead to the rupture of the 
intestines. 
  Regional Health Director Consuelo Aranas signed directives 
asking health officers in every city and municipality in the 
region to monitor the situation and conduct epidemiological 
investigation.

  [Text] The military's planned testing of an AIDS vaccine 
on HIV-positive soldiers has been suspended while another 
candidate vaccine undergoes trials, according to a high-ranking 
officer in the Defense Ministry's Medical Department. 
  The department's Military Research Institute had intended to 
run trials with the vaccine gpl60. Approval was given by the 
National Committee on AIDS on February 14. 
  Produced by the Micro Genesis company of the United States, 
gp160 is designed to combat the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
(HIV), which leads to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or 
AIDS. 
  "The candidate vaccine (gpl60) has not performed 
satisfactorily in tests on Americans," said the officer, who 
declined to be named. 
  The institute was considering another multivalent vaccine 
produced by United Biochemicals Inc (UBI) of the U.S. 
  "It is a synthetic vaccine which is designed to treat many 
kinds of HIV infection, including the Thai strain," the officer 
said. 
  However military testing of the vaccine could not start for 
another six to eight months and would need the approval of the 
National Committee on AIDS. 
  The committee has already approved testing of a UBI vaccine 
by the Thai Red Cross under the auspices of the World Health 
Organization. 
  Project director Prof. Praphan Phanuphak announced on 
Wednesday that tests would start on May I using civilian 
volunteers who test HIV-negative. 
  "WHO will be responsible for scrutinizing the trials and 
making sure there is no breach of ethics or human rights," he 
said.

  [Text] An inspection of our hospitals shows that they 
cannot fill the needs of patients treated with blood or its 
by-products. The blood donation problem has become more 
distressing because of the simple fact of the danger of the 
spread of AIDS, as well as the increase of accidents resulting 
from the increase in the number of vehicles in our country. We 
interviewed Agim Kociraj, director of the Blood Transfusion 
Service, about this problem. 
  Unattributed reporter: Mr. Agim, how is such a 
situation created? 
  Kociraj: As the public is aware, three cases of 
HIV positive AIDS infection have been identified in Albania. 
The very important role of the Blood Transfusion Service in the 
spread of this infection is also known. At this very important 
moment, we have managed to exert 100 percent control over the 
amount of blood collected from the blood donation system with 
regard to the presence of this very dangerous infection. 
However, the fact that all of the blood is 100 percent 
controlled does not mean that the danger is completely 
eliminated. Everyone knows that the methodology used cannot 
identify the presence of the infection in its first phases. It 
is known that this infection can be reduced at minimum, but 
cannot be eliminated. In order to reduce to a minimum the 
possibility of the infection spreading through the blood, it is 
necessary to include in the blood donation system blood donors 
from groups that less endangered than the majority of the 
population insofar as carrying this infection. The fact that in 
Albania the system operates with 100 percent paid donors does 
not help much in this direction. This for the very obvious fact 
that a small group of paid blood donors are always one of the 
most endangered groups insofar as being an AIDS virus carrier. 
  What is envisioned, and what is being done in this 
direction? 
  Viewing the problem with much seriousness, the Health 
Ministry, in cooperation with the Blood Transfusion Service, has 
passed a new regulation that anticipates collecting blood from 
less endangered groups, first from the relatives and friends of 
patients who need blood in our hospitals. This has considerable 
importance because family members and relatives are of the less 
endangered groups insofar as carrying the AIDS virus. For this 
reason, we think we should cooperate with the relatives, family 
members, visitors, and friends of the sick who need blood, so 
that they prove their bond with the patients, considering that 
these patients not only need blood but need the best ensured 
blood. 
  This is the short-term program. The long-term program 
contains a very broad propagandistic campaign for the creation 
of a completely new tradition that has not heretofore existed in 
Albania -- the establishment of voluntary, unpaid blood 
donation. This program includes governmental and 
non-governmental institutions such as the Albanian Red Cross and 
the Health Education Directorate. Enormous assistance by the 
mass media is absolutely necessary in this direction. For this 
reason, I take advantage of the opportunity to first thank 
Albanian Television, which is showing interest in the 
introduction of this program.

<F P=106> [Report by Chong Chang-won] </F>
  [Text] An International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
reliable source said: In the course of its inspection of 
nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, North Korea, the IAEA inspection 
team discovered today that some seals of main nuclear facilities 
were damaged and is taking follow-up measures. 
  The source said that seals for reactors of five megawatt and 
over, which had been used for extracting plutonium, were not 
damaged and that some seals in the radiochemical laboratory -- a 
nuclear waste reprocessing facility -- and in the nuclear fuel 
producing plant seemed to have problems. 
  The source explained: It is a convention for an inspection 
team to confirm if nuclear materials in containers with damaged 
seals are identical to those listed in the first report 
submitted by a country that is subject to IAEA inspections, as 
soon as seal damage is confirmed. This enables the inspection 
team to determine if nuclear materials have been diverted to 
other purposes. 
  David Kyd, information director of the IAEA, said: I am 
unable to comment now on the question about seal damage in North 
Korea's nuclear facilities. I will report the details of the 
result of the ongoing inspection on North Korea to the next 
meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors. 
  Saying that the inspection team is now smoothly conducting 
inspections at Yongbyon, Director Kyd hinted that the question 
about the seal damage, which caused arguments between the 
inspection team and the North Korean authorities, has been 
solved smoothly. 
  The inspection team will continue to inspect nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon until this weekend and will leave 
Pyongyang around 15 March after winding up its inspection early 
next week.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that North Korea had trouble 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection 
team from the beginning of the inspection because it did not 
comply with the agreement to allow IAEA's full-scope inspection 
[chonmyon sachal] but only allowed limited inspection [chehan 
sachal], including the replacement of surveillance devices. 
  It has been learned that the IAEA will closely review the 
inspection results as soon as the inspection team returns early 
this week to decide whether or not to call a special Board of 
Governors meeting. 
  According to information from a well-informed IAEA source 
obtained today, during the 10-day inspection, which began on 3 
March, North Korea did not allow the checking of the points for 
the full-scope inspection required by the IAEA and only allowed 
limited inspections, including the replacement of surveillance 
devices. 
  The source said North Korea only allowed limited 
inspections, 
including the replacement of surveillance devices, and that 
inspections on North Korean facilities did not go smoothly from 
the beginning. It seemed that the inspection team and the North 
Korean authorities had considerable disagreement regarding the 
broken seals in the radioactive chemical laboratory, in 
particular. 
  The source said the inspection team considered returning 
earlier than the original two-week schedule because North Korea 
did not immediately allow follow-up steps for the confirmation 
of the contents resulted from the broken seals in the 
radioactive chemical laboratory. 
  The inspection team finished their preparations to leave on 
11 and 12 March and will return early this week. The IAEA 
established a policy to call an emergency special Board of 
Governors meeting if it comes to a conclusion that the 
inspections required by the IAEA were not conducted after 
receiving a more accurate inspection report from the inspection 
team.

  [Text] A relevant government official said on 11 March: 
During the course of the nuclear inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] -- which started on 3 
March -- North Korea has so far refused to allow the IAEA 
inspection team to take samples from the "hot cell," which is a 
facility to extract or process plutonium from the radiochemical 
laboratory, one of the key objects of the nuclear inspections. 
Therefore, North Korea has been in conflict with the IAEA. 
  Taking samples from the hot cell is an important means for 
the nuclear inspection to check North Korea's plutonium 
processing. Also, this is an important clue in determining the 
differences between the amount of plutonium extracted as 
declared by North Korea and the amount of plutonium North Korea 
has really processed. 
  A relevant government official said that "the ongoing 
conflict between North Korea and the IAEA regarding the nuclear 
inspection is due to North Korea's refusal to allow the 
extraction of the samples from the hot cell," and that "the IAEA 
and the United States are very dissatisfied with its refusal." 
  He said that "despite its agreement with the IAEA in the 
course of nuclear negotiations regarding the sample extraction 
from the hot cell, necessary for guaranteeing nuclear safety, 
North Korea had refused an actual inspection." 
  Concerning this, a relevant Foreign Ministry official said 
that "whether the North Korean refusal to allow the inspectors 
to obtain samples from hot cells has threatened the objective of 
the inspection is a matter that the IAEA should decide on" and 
that "we need to watch the other processes of the inspection 
because there are some other means to check the plutonium 
extraction without the extraction of samples from the hot cell."

<F P=106> [Report by Pak Tu-sik] </F>
  [Text] It was learned on 12 March that the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has made partial changes on its 
inspection plan, in which the agency was to begin inspections on 
North Korean nuclear facilities on 3 March and finish them 
around 14 March, and decided to have some members of the 
inspection team remain in North Korea for additional inspections. 
  Since North Korea postponed inspections on the radioactive 
chemical laboratory in Yongbyon, contrary to what it had 
promised to the IAEA, and sufficient inspections cannot be 
completed by 14 March -- deadline for scheduled inspections -- 
the IAEA decided to extend the schedule and have some members 
stay there for one or two more days to inspect the facility. It 
has been learned that the IAEA had already made a tentative 
agreement with North Korea on the inspection method of the 
radioactive chemical laboratory, which is believed to be a 
nuclear reprocessing facility. The IAEA plans to have 
inspection members, aside from the ones who will stay longer, 
return to the IAEA's secretariat office in Vienna on 15 March as 
scheduled. 
  A well-informed diplomatic source in Seoul explained: "The 
IAEA actually finished inspecting the North Korean nuclear 
facilities during the past inspections and is eager to have the 
results back at the IAEA headquarters for analysis. Some 
members will stay for a more thorough inspection of the last 
radioactive chemical laboratory and all of them will be back by 
the middle of next week." Regarding the broken seals, the IAEA 
verified the information and accepted North Korea's explanation 
that "those were because of careless handling." 
  The source said: "North Korea intended to test the will of 
the ROK and U.S. Governments by deliberately creating obstacles 
to the exchange of North and South special envoys, however, the 
IAEA appraises that North Korea accepted comparatively easily 
the IAEA inspections, which are directly connected with UN 
sanctions."

  [Text] It has been learned that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] will decide this week whether it will 
convene a special Board of Governors meeting to intensively 
discuss the North Korean nuclear issue after hearing the precise 
report of the inspection team's activities in North Korea. 
  North Korea did not allow the inspection team to immediately 
confirm whether some seals, which are the core target of the 
current inspection, were broken or not. Thus, North Korea 
restricted the team's inspection activities. The IAEA regards 
this as an act of breaking the agreement. 
  Accordingly, the IAEA inspection team was going to leave 
earlier than the originally scheduled period of two-weeks. 
However, the inspection team abandoned the early departure idea 
in consideration of China's reaction. 
  The IAEA inspection team is going to leave Pyongyang around 
15 March after completing its inspection activities.

<F P=106> [Report by staff correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Tehran -- Major General Mohsen Reza'i scoffed at 
Western media reports that claim Iran is for nuclear weapons 
saying "Political logic, morality, our own culture and above all 
the situation in today's world does not allow us to have such 
deadly weapons. [quotation marks as received] 
  The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps head said, "Political 
wisdom asks us not to go for weapons which could cause 
devastation for humanity." 
  "Of course, we are for traditional weapons and that too just 
for self-defense...and that's all," he said. 
  The eight-year Iraqi imposed war is proof of the real nature 
of our combatants who never violated the internationally 
recognized norms concerning war Major Gen. Reza'i recalled. 
  He was referring to the Iraqi forces who left no stone 
unturned violating the basic tradition of war using chemical 
bombs against both civilians and military personnel. The Iraqi 
forces also frequently bombed purely civilians areas during 
their 1980-88 imposed war. 
  "That Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons...is just 
baseless rumor," Reza'i refuted. 
  Western media repeatedly say Iran will or has already 
provided the necessary facilities to Communist North Korea for 
testing missiles with ranges up to 1,000 kilometers. What is 
Reza'i's explanation? 
  "No, a firm no," Major Gen. Reza'i told the TEHRAN TIMES in 
an exclusive interview at his office. 
  "By now the entire world should know that Iran is very 
sensitive as far as our soil and military facilities are 
concerned and we will never allow others to use it...no matter 
how friendly `others' are," he said referring to the friendly 
ties with North Korea. 
  "As long as I'm talking about the real nature of the Islamic 
combatants and the officials of the Islamic Republic, it will 
not be out of place to mention the Russian requests which Iran 
turned down without a second thought," Reza'i, 41, said. 
  "Despite our animosity and enmity against the United States 
we rejected repeated requests from Moscow to deliver to them the 
F-14 fighter plane and the wire-guided anti-tank missile, TOW," 
he said. 
  He disclosed that even the U.S. through various channels 
tried to obtain a Soviet-made T-72 tank which we seized from the 
Ba'thist forces during the Iraqi-imposed war. 
  The United States once more received 'a firm no' from the 
Islamic Republic despite a number of tempting offers from the 
Pentagon, he said. 
  Maj. Gen. Reza'i, head the IRGC for the last 13 years, comes 
from Masjed Soleyman, Khuzestan Province. 
  In answer to another question, Reza'i said the Kuridish 
problem in Iraq is under our observation and our forces are 
ready to counter any sort of terrorist activities launched from 
there. 
  Referring to the agreement signed by Iran and Turkey he 
said, 
"It has eased the situation." 
  He denounced Iraq for sending terrorists and taking undue 
advantage from the present situation in the region underlining 
the fact that that itself was a violation of the 1988 ceasefire 
and against the traditional practice of friendly neighbors. 
  Reza'i is married with five children and currently studying 
economics at the post-graduate level. He has a glorious record 
of revolutionary activities against the now defunct Shah's 
regime. 
  Commenting on the Persian Gulf he said, "The geographical 
situation of the waterway is such that the deep water is on 
Iran's side which enables the Islamic forces to keep alien 
warships under observation." 
  Without going into details he said there was a plot 
engineered by Britain, Israel and the United States designed to 
keep regional tensions high. 
  "I think," he said, "the plot proved to be a mouse trap for 
the United States. 
  "It's my view that no country should think that they can 
take 
undue advantage from the differences between Iran and another 
Persian Gulf country," he warned. 
  He pointed out that the Iraqi regime made the same mistake 
in 
1980 and "we all know the consequences of that." 
  "I tell my friends in the UAE to listen to my advice as Iran 
wants to continue friendly relations with all the shaykhdoms 
there," Reza'i said. 
  The IRGC played a vital role during the Iraqi-imposed war 
and 
received compliments from the Leader of the world's deprived, 
the late Imam Khomeyni. 
  Commenting on the post-war era Reza'i said the IRGC is busy 
with extensive construction projects in the country. He said 
IRGC personnel, popularly known in Iran as 'Sepahis,' are 
constructing a major dam, Karkheh, in Khuzestan Province. For 
the last two years, the Sepahis have been building the dam which 
is 3 kilometers long, 150 meters high with a capacity of 7 
billion cubic meters of water. 
  So far Rls. 600 billion have been spent on the project and 
it 
is estimated that Rls. 1 trillion will be spent before it is 
completed. 
  The IRGC personnel are also working on the 100-kilometer 
Tehran- Saveh highway to provide a natural gas supply network 
for the nation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "South Africa: A Nuclear Nightmare"] </F>
  [Text] New details of the government's nuclear partnership 
with Israel and its efforts to design sophisticated nuclear 
weapons capable of devastating civilian populations as far away 
as Lagos and Nairobi are contained in a series of official 
documents in Africa Confidential's possession. The documents -- 
transcripts from the secret trial of a South African Air Force 
officer and from the government's classified submissions to the 
International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) -- show that much 
vital information has been kept from the public. They also show 
that President Frederik de Klerk's statement to parliament on 23 
March 1993 that the government had built then destroyed just six 
crude nuclear devices fell far short of the whole truth. 
  The sophistication of the securocrats' nuclear ambitions in 
the 1970's and 1980's was grotesquely at odds with the disarray 
and venality among the government officials involved in the 
project, as evidence given in the secret trial of Air Force 
Brigadier Johann Blaauw in 1987-88 at the Supreme Court in 
Capetown makes clear. 
  Classified documents from the trial obtained by Africa 
Confidential trace how Brig. Blaauw, who negotiated a deal with 
Israel for the supply of tritium (a key ingredient required to 
make thermonuclear weapons) fell out with former Minister of 
Labour and Mines Fanie Botha. Blaauw claimed that Botha had 
promised him diamond concessions in Namaqualand, on South 
Africa's western seaboard, in return for his work on the nuclear 
programme but then failed to deliver. Botha denied this but 
said that Blaauw ad threatened to make public details about the 
nuclear programme and the alleged improprieties linked to it. By 
the time of their falling out, Botha had incurred substantial 
debts and had his assets sequestrated following his resignation 
from ministerial office and parliament on 15 November 1983 after 
some highly critical press reports. 
  In November l984, the police in Pretoria arrested Blaauw on 
charges of attempted extortion against Fanie Botha and 
possession of secret data concerning the Koeberg nuclear power 
reactor. However, Blaauw was acquitted in September 1988 and he 
is still pursuing his claim for the allegedly promised mining 
concessions through the civil courts. 
  Blaauw had an exemplary Air Force career which began in 
World 
War II and included service with Western forces in Palestine, 
the Korean War and the Berlin airlift. Following his retirement 
from the Air Force in l975, Blaauw was the messenger in some of 
Pretoria's most sensitive military transactions with Israel. 
  It is difficult to see how De Klerk, who took over the 
mining 
portfolio from Botha, would not have been briefed about the 
tensions between Botha and Blaauw and the nature of Blaauw's 
work on the nuclear programme with Israel. 
  In fact, De Klerk testified at Blaauw's trial, saying that 
Fanie Botha, a political rival, approached him after a cabinet 
meeting and told him he had been in the process of awarding a 
mining concession to Blaauw and asking if a way could be found 
to grant it. There is absolutely no evidence linking De Klerk 
to the illicit transactions surrounding the nuclear programme 
and sources close to the highest levels of government have told 
Africa Confidential that De Klerk got in and out of the ministry 
as quickly as possible. By the end of the 1980's, De Klerk was 
said to be unable "to come to terms philosophically" with the 
securocrats' plans to develop thermonuclear weapons whose 
primary target would be African civilians. 
  However, De Klerk's apparent "road to Damascus" on the 
nuclear weapons programme still has not facilitated a full 
admission of the extent of the government's nuclear programme. 
This lack of frankness about the nuclear programme concerns 
senior officials in Western governments particularly at a time 
when South Africa is negotiating a delicate transition where the 
loyalties of some senior officials in the security forces appear 
uncertain. 
  Blaauw's errand to secure tritium from Israel is 
significant: 
Tritium is a gas used to boost the power of nuclear weapons 
creating fusion or thermonuclear bombs. In information 
submitted to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency], 
which monitors compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty (NPT) for the United Nations, the government admitted 
that its weapons programme had involved lithium-6 separation, a 
means of producing tritium. So sensitive is this information 
that senior African National Congress (ANC) officials, some of 
whom will be holding ministerial office after the April 
elections, have been refused access to it. 
  According to a September 1993 IAEA document obtained by 
Africa Confidential, the programme had also progressed by the 
early 1980's to planning a 150 megawatt reactor capable of 
producing tritium and plutonium. The reactor, which was to have 
been built at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay, never got beyond the 
basic engineering preparations. But Pretoria continued to work 
on developing thermonuclear weapons until 1985 or l986, 
according to Wynand de Villiers of Pretoria's Atomic Energy 
Corporation and Roger Jardine, the ANC's science policy 
coordinator. Pretoria began dismantling its nuclear weapons 
programme in 1990, in preparation for signing the NPT the 
following year. 
  In his 24 March 1993 speech De Klerk also insisted that "at 
no time did South Africa acquire nuclear technology from another 
country." Apart from United States intelligence reports 
attesting to Israeli-South African nuclear collaboration, 
additional information would have been available to De Klerk, 
during his tenure at the Mines Ministry, to indicate that 
tritium production is the result of a highly sophisticated 
technology, one which South Africa had not mastered. 
  At his trial, Blaauw testified that he negotiated for the 
supply of 30 grammes of tritium from Israel in exchange for 600 
tonnes of "yellowcake" (uranium oxide). The tritium-yellowcake 
exchange deal is described in some detail in a recent book by 
William E. Burrows and Robert Windrem. 
Footnote 
  "Critical Mass" by William Burrows and Robert Windrem (Simon 
and Schuster) 1994). They write that the sensitive arrangements 
were jointly overseen by South Africa's then intelligence 
agency, the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) and the Israeli 
intelligence division Lish Ka le-Kishrei (Lakam) which 
specialised in nuclear and technological procurement and came to 
public attention when it was linked to the Jonathan Jay Pollard 
spy scandal in the USA in 1985. 
  Blaauw testified at the trial that he had established South 
Africa's Israeli connection through a South African who had 
emigrated to Israel. In this way Blaauw was able to make 
high-level military contacts in Israel. Initially the two men 
arranged the emergency supply of South African spare parts for 
Mirage aircraft, needed by Israel after the 1973 war. 
  Then Blaauw arranged a deal with an Israeli front company in 
Wiesbaden, Germany, through which he obtained British tanks and 
Browning machine guns for South Africa, according to the trial 
documents. Finally, Blaauw said he was approached by one 
"Benjamine" of Lakam (almost certainly Benjamin Blumberg, chief 
of Lakam between 1957 and 1981), who asked if South Africa would 
sell Israel yellowcake which can be enriched to make fuel for 
nuclear weapons or power reactors. 
  Through his service in South African military liaison during 
the Rhodesian war, in which he took part in many joint covert 
activities with Salisbury and helped set up a meeting between 
white leader Ian Smith, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and 
South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Blaauw became a 
confidant of General Hendrik van den Bergh, then head of the 
security police -- and subsequently the head of BOSS. He told 
the court that he then approached Van den Bergh with Lakam's 
request and Van den Bergh got the go-ahead for the deal from 
John Vorster. In April 1976 Vorster visited Israel and signed a 
comprehensive set of military and economic cooperation pacts. 
  According to Burrows' and Windrem's book, Israeli and South 
African officials, including director of Lakam Benjamin Blumberg 
and then Information Ministry Secretary Eschel Rhoodie travelled 
as escorts on the twelve flights which brought the tritium -- 
2.5 grams at a time -- to South Africa. Small as the quantity 
was, it would have been enough to make one bomb every six weeks. 
  Piet Koornhof, Minister for Mines at the time the yellowcake 
deal was struck, was replaced by Fanie Botha in a Vorster 
reshuffle. Fanie Botha's interest in the Defence portfolio was 
known by Vorster: Blaauw testified that arrangements were made 
for Botha to tour secret Israeli military installations in 
preparation for his elevation to the defence portfolio. Blaauw 
said he handled the details of Botha's itinerary and accompanied 
him to Israel. 
  Botha was a hit with the Israelis. "Look after Fanie Botha," 
Blaauw's contact in Israel told him. He explained to the court 
that Israel wanted to keep Botha at the Mines Ministry until the 
yellowcake shipments were complete. After that, they were eager 
for him to become Defence Minister, hoping that he would be more 
cooperative than Pieter W. Botha, who held the post at the time. 
  Blaauw testified that he began diverting funds to Fanie 
Botha 
from a US$1 million "gift" he had received from Israel. The 
objective was not to sweeten Botha, Blaauw explained, but to 
keep his political career from being destroyed by mounting 
personal debt. 
  Botha's trusted administrative secretary Frances Peter van 
Ravensway Whelpton, however, was an outright crook. He pocketed 
all but Rand [R] 110,000 ($34,000) of the R. 420,000 that Blaauw 
provided for Botha between 1977 and 1980. The funds were 
channelled through Whelpton so that Botha would not know the 
source and to distance him from the source, which was kickbacks 
from Pretoria's arms deals with Israel, according to Blaauw. 
Additionally, Blaauw admitted making small payments to 
Whelpton, who apparently conceived and facilitated the grant of 
mining concessions on state-owned land (Sea Areas 1 and 2 on the 
West Coast) to Blaauw's company Ondombo Beleggings which 
precipitated the fall out with Botha. Whelpton pleaded guilty 
to extortion and illicitly possessing state secrets and was 
sentenced to five years in prison. It was several months before 
Blaauw realised that Botha was slow to hand over the mining 
leases because those areas had already been promised to others. 
  As an interesting sidenote, two senior officials from Anglo- 
American submitted testimony to the trial. According to the 
presiding judge's interpretation of the testimony of Harry 
Oppenheimer (Chairman of Anglo-American from 1957 to March 1983) 
was that Oppenheimer undertook to do what he could to assist 
Fanie Botha and in fact had an interview with Tertius Myburgh, 
the editor of the Sunday Times, as a result of which no 
information about Fanie Botha's financial position was published 
in that newspaper [sentence as published]. 
  However, the judge's interpretation is at variance with 
Oppenheimer's recollection of his testimony. Oppenheimer told 
Africa Confidential on 2 February 1994 that although he had no 
control over what was published in the English press in South 
Africa he had "said he would pass on to Myburgh what Botha had 
told him. He subsequently told Myburgh the substance of his 
conversation with Botha, but he did not ask Myburgh whether he 
intended to publish any story relating to the Minister's 
affairs. Myburgh did say he was aware of rumours surrounding 
Minister Botha's affairs, and that these were being investigated 
by his reporters. Oppenheimer did not ask, nor did Myburgh 
undertake, not to publish any information regarding Botha's 
financial position." According to Oppenheimer, nothing was 
published about Botha at that time for fear of libel. 
  The current Chairman of Anglo American, Julian Ogilvie 
Thompson, has given his version of the events surrounding the 
applications for the mining rights on Namaqualand sea areas l-5. 
Blaauw testified that he had disputed with Ogilvie Thompson 
about which concessions Anglo American should pursue. Ogilvie 
Thompson has told Africa Confidential that he first met Blaauw 
in June 1979 in Anglo American's offices where Blaauw "advised 
De Beers (Anglo American's sister company) of a change in the 
Namaqualand sea areas from discouraging to encouraging 
applications for rights to prospect for diamonds." De Beers 
subsequently applied for mining rights in sea areas 1-5 but the 
forms were mislaid. Ogilvie Thompson says that the last time he 
met Blaauw, who he says was trying to negotiate the concessions 
for himself, was in March 1980 at a rendezvous on the N1 
highway, when he gave Blaauw a duplicate set of the mining 
rights applications which were to be delivered personally to the 
Minister. Ogilvie Thompson added: "No payment was asked for or 
made by De Beers to any person in connection with these 
applications." 
  The Namaqualand sea areas 1-2 were awarded to State Alluvial 
Diggings and UK-based Selection Trust Company respectively, and 
sea area 3 to US-based Sedco. Areas 4 and 5 went to De Beers: 
Setrust, Sedco and De Beers have subsequently joined together 
in a joint venture. 
  In 1981, after attempting to secure the promised leases by 
legal action, Blaauw joined by Whelpton began to pressure Botha, 
who in turn began lobbying the Van Winsen Committee which had 
begun reviewing the leases. According to the court documents, 
Blaauw and Whelpton also began threatening to expose how, during 
the power struggle sparked by John Vorster's fall in the 1978 
information scandal, Fanie Botha, a weak contender for the 
succession, agreed that Blaauw should eavesdrop on the phones 
and conversations of some his rivals including Foreign Minister 
Pik Botha, De Klerk, I.S.J. Schoeman, A.J. Raubenheimer, and A. 
P. Treurnicht. 
  Blaauw and Whelpton also planned to allege publicly that 
Fanie Botha plotted with them to implicate two National Party 
MPs in illegal diamond transactions, according to testimony in 
the case. Another alleged plan, to circulate stories in 
Parliament about a sex scandal involving Pik Botha, also made 
its way into the court record. More seriously and perhaps a 
harbinger of the corruption exposed in the 1990s, the court 
entered as evidence a document, which according to Blaauw 
testimony, contained a list of Swiss bank accounts opened by 
senior officials in the government. The document passed through 
the hands of Whelpton and Blaauw, although it is not clear for 
what purpose. 
  When Blaauw threatened to release this information, Botha 
called in the police, who began taping telephone calls and 
meetings. Botha, who never flatly confirmed or denied that he 
had granted the concessions, later admitted to Judge G. Friedman 
that he had erased parts of the tape of his meetings with Blaauw. 
  Friedman cleared Blaauw of extortion and appeared convinced 
that Fanie Botha had promised him the concessions in July 1979. 
It was proper for Blaauw to have the classified document 
concerning Koeberg's fuel requirements, ruled Friedman, because 
he was working closely with Wynand de Villiers, director of the 
Atomic Energy Corporation, to obtain enriched uranium for the 
reactor.

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Stober and Jane Hunter, the American-based </F>
editor of ISRAELI FOREIGN AFFAIRS, "an independent publication 
on Israel's activities outside the Middle East, and the author 
of many articles on Israeli-South African military collaboration 
and Israel's nuclear weapons"] 
  [Text] Testimony in the trial of South African Air Force 
Brigadier Johann Blaauw, and South African submissions to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, leave no doubt that 
President F.W. de Klerk is still lying about key aspects of his 
government's nuclear weapons programme. 
  First disclosed in AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, Blaauw's evidence 
was 
the subject of a MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN front page story last week, 
which called into question De Klerk's assertion last year that 
South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons technology or 
material from another country, or provided another country with 
nuclear materials. Reacting to the expose, De Klerk insisted 
that South Africa's procurement of 30g of tritium from Israel, 
and its provision of yellow cake urinium to Israel, were not 
part of collaboration between the countries on nuclear and 
conventional weapons. 
  His statement was endorsed by Atomic Energy Corporation 
chief 
Waldo Stumpf. Cape Supreme Court documents make it clear that 
Blaauw was the government's key intermediary in sensitive 
military deals with Israel, including those involving tritium 
and yellow cake. 
  It was General Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for 
State Security (Boss) who personally asked Blaauw to get 
tritium, according to the documents. They note that the 30g 
Blaauw ultimately secured "was sufficient for the manufacture of 
12 atomic bombs." 
  The tritium shipments were so sensitive that ranking South 
African and Israeli officials accompanied the 12 air shipments 
of the gaseous substance, and the heads of both governments were 
notified each time a shipment was successfully completed, 
according to the newly published book CRITICAL MASS by U.S. 
journalists William Burrows and Robert Windrem. 
  Much of what South African officials withheld from the 
public 
was told to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), which is charged with verifying the government's 
compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. According 
to a confidential IAEA document -- it bears the identifying 
numbers GOV/2684 and 93-03174 -- South Africa's Atomic Energy 
Corporation "received some tritium in 1977, but after the 
withdrawal of a small sample for the verification of its 
quality, the material remained in store until 1987." 
  During that time, according to the IAEA document, South 
Africa was engaged in "theoretical and practical" research on 
"lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible 
future use in boosted devices." 
  The government also did the preliminary engineering work on 
a 
reactor -- "to be built at a site at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay" 
-- to produce and recover plutonium and tritium, says the IAEA, 
repeating information provided by the De Klerk administration. 
It adds: "In September 1985 the South African government 
decided to .. stop all work related to possible plutonium 
devices and to limit the production of lithium-6, but to allow 
further development work on implosion technology and theoretical 
work on more advanced devices." 
  The 1985 date seems compellingly to coincide with the 
refusal 
of international financial organisations to roll over their 
loans to South Africa. It is reasonable to infer that if 
sanctions had not started to bite, the South African Government 
would have built an advanced nuclear device whose only purpose 
could be to attack -- or threaten -- nations within range of its 
surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. 
  Even after putting its advanced weapons programme on ice, 
South Africa kept the tritium for another two years. With 
extensive Israeli help, it worked on developing its own versions 
of Israel's Jericho missiles. 
  After the two countries jointly tested a South African 
Jericho clone from the Overberg test range in July 1989, U.S. 
officials told reporters that one of the several missiles Israel 
was helping South Africa develop was intended for delivering 
nuclear warheads. Last year De Klerk asserted that South Africa 
only planned to make seven crude nuclear weapons and only 
intended the six which were actually made as a "deterrent". 
This purportedly meant testing a bomb in order to blackmail 
Washington to save the established order from "total onslaught". 
  At an international conference last weekend to discuss 
future 
nuclear policy for South Africa, the head of the ANC's [African 
National Congress] science and technology department, Roger 
Jardine, slammed De Klerk's "list of lies" about South Africa's 
nuclear weapons programme. He called for the nuclear industry 
to be opened to full public scrutiny.

  [Text] Officials at the Egyptian Nuclear Energy Agency have 
stated that Finnish officials, in cooperation with the Israeli 
Atomic Energy Organization, are currently examining a site in 
the Negev Desert, a few kilometers away from the al-'Awja' area 
in Egypt, for a 400-megawatt Russian nuclear plant. 
  The Egyptian officials pointed out that Finland had bought a 
number of Russian nuclear reactors and agreed to supply Israel 
with one of them after upgrading it and introducing Western 
technology to it. It will be used to generate electricity.

<F P=106> [Walid Abi-Murshid report: "After Failure of Its Endeavors </F>
With German Siemens And Czech Skoda, Iran Is Concluding Contract 
With Spanish Nuclear Company To Divert Two Reactors to Military 
Use"] 
  [Text] London -- Tehran is currently negotiating with a 
Spanish company for engineers and nuclear technology to supply 
it with the technology needed to divert four nuclear reactors in 
Iran from civilian to military use. 
  Iran turned to a Spanish company to supply it with the 
diversion technology known as "Diversion" [word in English] 
after it failed in the past to obtain this technology from the 
German company Siemens and the Czech company Skoda. Iran 
accuses the German and Czech companies of submitting to U.S. 
pressure in their withdrawal from the project to offer their 
nuclear engineering services. As is known, the Spanish company 
dealt in the past with the German company Siemens and it has the 
nuclear engineering expertise available to the German company. 
The Spanish company participated with Siemens in building the 
Bushehr reactors in Iran. 
  After the failure of its previous attempts to obtain Western 
diversion technology, which is more advanced than Russian and 
Chinese technology, Tehran was eager to submit its new order for 
Spanish technology in the framework of its endeavors to improve 
safety levels for the two nuclear reactors it is building with 
Russian expertise in Gargar and the two reactors (300 megawatts) 
it is building with Chinese expertise in al-Ahvaz. 
  Nearly a month ago the Iranian Nuclear Energy Commission 
signed a contract with the Spanish company, under which the 
latter undertakes to provide engineering services for one of the 
two Chinese reactors in al-Ahvaz , and a similar contract to 
provide the same services for the the Russian Bushehr reactor, 
after signing a contract with the Russians to rebuild it. The 
deal concluded with the Spanish company totals $80 million. 
  In the first stage Iran hopes that the Spanish company will 
resume building the Bushehr reactor, 80 percent of which has 
been completed, before the German company Siemens pulls out of 
the project. 
  As is known, the capacity of this reactor is 1,000 
megawatts. 
  However, Tehran expects now to obtain technology from Spain 
to divert the Bushehr and Gargar reactors from civilian to 
military use. 
  Tehran's great interest in these negotiations is reflected 
in 
the level of its negotiating delegation, which is headed by Reza 
Amrollahi [as transliterated], assistant to President Rafsanjani 
for nuclear affairs and chairman of the Iranian Nuclear Energy 
Commission, his deputy Mahir 'Alizadeh, and Mohammad Kazem 
Rasuli, director of the Nuclear Technological Center in Esfahan 
(ENTC). 
  In charge of the negotiations from the Spanish side are the 
director general of the Spanish company and his assistant. The 
director general of the Spanish company participated with 
Siemens in building the Bushehr reactor. 
  It is worth mentioning that 300-megawatt nuclear reactors 
are 
technologically capable of being diverted from civilian to 
military use.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 16, IRNA -- A spokesman for the Atomic 
Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Ali Shirzadian, here 
Wednesday strongly denied the recent allegations by London-based 
Arabic daily AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT on Tehran-Madrid nuclear 
cooperation for military purposes. 
  Interviewed by IRNA, Shirzadian stressed that Iran's nuclear 
program aims at peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and its 
activities are within the framework of the rules and regulations 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The daily which is simultaneously published in London and 
Beirut, in its Monday edition alleged that a Spanish nuclear 
firm is to provide Iran with necessary technology to transform 
its two nuclear installations for peaceful utilization of that 
energy into plants with military purposes. 
  The daily claimed that the Spanish company is to sell 
diversion technology to IRAN under a 80 million dlrs [dollars] 
contract signed by an Iranian nuclear delegation in Madrid last 
month. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear 
Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and has repeatedly announced its 
firm adherence to it. 
  The official noted that Iran has always proclaimed that its 
nuclear facilites are open to the IAEA and the agency's 
inspection teams have repeatedly confirmed that Iran's nuclear 
program is for peaceful purposes. 
  Despite the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
repeatedly rejected such wild reports, some segments of the 
western media are trying to portray Iran as a country which is 
in quest for nuclear arms, regretted Shirzadian. 
  In a separate statement today, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs also rejected rumours circulated by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
daily accusing Iran of seeking nuclear weapons. 
  The statment dismissed as "baseless" the daily's allegations 
and called it part of the psychological war against Iran by the 
arrogant countries and the zionist regime. 
  Certain media often lauch such fabrications of Iran's 
cooperation with a third party, in a bid to poison world public 
opinion against Iran's peaceful nuclear program and the peaceful 
ends of its foreign policy and they want to undermine its 
friendly relations with Spain, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  On December 2, Iran's permanent representative at the United 
Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, announced at the general assembly 
meeting that Iran is firmly committed to the establishment of 
the Middle East as a nuclear free zone (NFZ).

<F P=106> [Report by Raymond Whittaker: "Libyan Nerve Gas Tanks Go </F>
Missing in Malaysia"] 
  [Text] Equipment for a Libyan poison gas plant, made by a 
British-owned company in Malaysia and returned there last year 
after the United Nations Security Council blocked delivery, has 
disappeared. 
  The issue has resurfaced as the Pergau dam affair has put 
British dealings with Malaysia under intense scrutiny. It could 
complicate government attempts to remain on good terms with a 
country sensitive to any perceived interference in relations 
with fellow Islamic states. 
  Concern over Malaysia's Libyan connection was renewed 
recently when the government auctioned eight steel reactor tanks 
which had been returned from Singapore, where they were seized 
last March on the orders of the Security Council's sanctions 
committee. The buyer was a small local trading company whose 
only contact is a mobile telephone number. The equipment left a 
Malaysian customs warehouse a few weeks ago, though other 
governments have been told it is in the country and will not be 
permitted to reach Libya. 
  But one Western diplomat said: "We are not 100 per cent 
happy, and won't be until we see this equipment in the hands of 
a non- Libyan end-user who actually wants it." 
  Britain has co-ordinated efforts to keep the tanks out of 
Libya since becoming aware in 1989 of Tripoli's attempts to 
obtain them. It says the equipment could produce hundreds of 
tons of mustard gas and nerve gases. Kuala Lumpur refused to 
stop the first delivery attempt, saying they were for civilian 
use. 
  The telephone number of the buyer, Wargamas Management, is 
unobtainable, but investigators who have spoken to the company's 
directors say they claim to be trying to sell the vessels to 
Petronas, Malaysia's state oil company, or an American company. 
Another source said the equipment had been tailor-made for 
Tripoli and could not be adapted easily for other uses. 
  A spokesman for the Malaysian High Commission in London 
declined to comment, saying he would have to check with Kuala 
Lumpur. 
  Libya first tried in 1989 to order reactor vessels from a 
British engineering company, APV, saying they would be used to 
produce drilling mud for the oil industry. Western agencies 
suspected that they would be used to make chemical weapons. 
When the order was rejected, the Libyans turned to an obscure 
Malaysian company, Pacificwide Management, which again has only 
a mobile number. Pacificwide ordered the equipment from APV's 
Malaysian subsidiary, APV Hill and Mills, and went to court to 
obtain completion of the contract after the British-owned 
company, having become aware of the destination of the vessels, 
tried to back out. 
  With the Malaysian government refusing to intervene, Britain 
went to the sanctions committee. The shipment was declared to 
be a violation of the embargo imposed on Libya to force the 
handover of two intelligence agents accused of the Lockerbie 
bombing.

  [Text] The Kursk AES has been visited by a group of 
specialists of the "Tajura" Libyan nuclear research center. 
Al-Qadhdhafi's envoys suggested that the Kursk power engineers 
carry out research on the core -- the center -- of a working 
reactor. But they received a firm refusal. 
  However, the AES press center reported that a protocol of 
intent to conduct certain joint experiments and to implement a 
number of projects was nonetheless signed with the Libyan 
nuclear power workers. 
  The Kursk AES management flatly refused to reveal the sum 
being received for cooperation with the Libyan Jamahiriyah. It 
is a commercial secret. But it has been learned from certain 
sources that it is many times more than $100,000. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi's envoys were able to convince both 
"Atomenergoeksport" and the Kursk AES management that they have 
no intention of using nuclear power for anything other than 
peaceful purposes.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Lysenko: "German Police Fear Nuclear </F>
Terror"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The police are leaning toward the 
conclusion that the Lake Constance air crash (see IZVESTIYA Nos. 
23, 24, and 26) was probably just a clever trick by criminals 
trying to cover their tracks. 
  The Cessna's passengers -- Josef Rimmele and Klaus Eichler 
-- 
were in cahoots with the "Russian nuclear mafia." But the 
Cessna could not have been carrying 70 kilograms of cesium-137, 
since it would have required a four-tonne lead container in 
order to prevent radioactive emissions. A Cessna-425 cannot 
lift that kind of load. 
  The federal police and intelligence service are warning of a 
new threat from the east. The intelligence service submitted a 
report to the FRG chancellor entitled "Nuclear Black Market -- 
Nuclear Terror." 
  German specialists are particularly concerned about the 
increasing flow of radioactive materials from the CIS countries. 
Germany is acting as a staging post in the nuclear trade. In 
1990 the police recorded four instances of "nuclear trade." In 
1992 the figure was 158, while in 1993 there were exactly 200 
attempts to sell radioactive materials. 
  What kind of wares are the businessmen from the CIS 
offering? 
From plutonium and uranium-235 to cesium-137, cobalt-60, and 
strontium-90. 
  One-half of the 300 people suspected of trading in 
radioactive materials are from East Europe. The vast majority 
are citizens of Poland and Russia. According to German 
intelligence data, Kaunas and Vilnius are centers of "illegal 
nuclear activity." 
  German citizens, mainly from the former GDR, are also 
involved in all these attempts to organize the trade in 
radioactive materials. For example, the Cessna's missing 
passenger, Josef Rimmele, had connections with Klaus-Peter 
Nedvig [name as transliterated], son of the former chief of the 
GDR police. His successor, Klaus Eichler, caught Interpol's eye 
after he had attempted to buy a consignment of osmium from a 
Hungarian. 
  The Russian mafia has spread throughout Germany, the German 
papers write. 
  The German police frankly admit that, unbeknownst to state 
institutions, Russian emigres have been able to establish an 
entire network of firms as a front for illegal business. These 
firms are in close touch with criminal groups inside the CIS.

  [Text] Chelyabinsk, 16 Feb -- By the end of the year, Iraqi 
nuclear fuel will be reprocessed and, in accordance with 
agreement, will be completely returned to the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency], which has taken on the 
financial compensation for the expenditure. This was stated 
today by Viktor Fetisov, director of the leading enterprise of 
the national atomic industry -- the Mayak chemical combine. He 
was commenting on a media report that the enterprise had 
accepted for reprocessing the whole batch of enriched uranium 
from the research reactor in Iraq as planned. 
  We succeeded in winning the competition for effecting the 
project for rendering services to the IAEA, the Mayak chief 
said. It was a question of transporting from Iraq and 
reprocessing the nuclear fuel from the research reactor in 
fulfillment of the decisions of the UN Security Council 
resolution. In this connection, relevant instructions were 
taken from the Russian Government. This work is to our 
advantage since it makes it possible to take up unused 
production capacity and provide work for highly qualified staff.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Work For Russian Nuclear </F>
Experts"] 
  [Text] Three thousand Russian nuclear experts, previously 
working on nuclear weapons, could soon be employed at an 
institute for scientific and technological research in Moscow, 
paid for by the West and Japan. They would thus be switching to 
projects for the peaceful use of nuclear power and better 
protection for Russia's nuclear power stations. 
  Yesterday evening the European Parliament in Strasbourg gave 
the go-ahead for the founding of such an institute, by 
unanimously voting for a provisional protocol. This was 
required because the Russian Parliament, the Douma, was not able 
to ratify the agreement with the European Union, the United 
States, and Japan as a result of the stormy political events in 
Moscow. 
  During a debate in Strasbourg yesterday, the Dutch member of 
Parliament Jessica Larive (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
democracy]), European Parliament rapporteur on founding the new 
center in Moscow, referred to an urgent need to stop the 
braindrain from Russia of nuclear scientists who were all 
employed under the Soviet system on the production and 
maintenance of nuclear weapons. So far 500 have already left, 
possibly to suspected countries such as Iraq, Libya and Iran, 
plus the nuclear power China. 
  Between 1971 and 1993 some 700,000 people lived in the 10 
secret nuclear towns. Larive believes most of them are still 
there. But they no longer enjoy the former privileges such as 
high wages, free housing and education, and there are problems 
with food supplies. There is no other employment for the nuclear 
technicians, as they are bound to secrecy by the Russian 
Government. The hard core of 500 scientists with knowledge of 
the Soviet system for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons 
can now be employed on peaceful projects in Moscow. The 
European Union, the United States, and Japan have so far set 
aside some 126 million guilders for the center. Russia has even 
made a Moscow building available.

<F P=106> [Report by Choe Sang-hun] </F>
  [Text] Tunisia is seeking South Korean expertise in the 
high- tech fields of biotechnology, nuclear research techniques 
and computer and information technology, said a top science 
administrator from the North African country. 
  "South Korea has done a lot in acquiring advanced Western 
technologies and we want to learn from their experience and see 
what Koreans could do for our high-tech efforts," said Monji 
Safra in an interview with THE KOREA HERALD yesterday. 
  The Tunisian secretary of state to the prime minister in 
charge of scientific research and technology is here on a 
three-day visit to prepare a general agreement on science and 
technological cooperation with South Korea. 
  He met with Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung and 
other South Korean officials and heads of research institutes to 
discuss such an agreement yesterday. 
  Safra named biotechnology, nuclear research and computers as 
potential sectors for bilateral technological cooperation. 
  "We want to see what our biotechnology centers could do in 
joint efforts with their South Korean counterparts to improve 
seeds and increase agricultural productivity," he said. 
  Tunisia also has an ambition of becoming the chief provider 
of computer software for Arab and African countries, especially 
software adopted for the needs of small businesses. 
  The country is investing heavily in telecommunications. For 
example, it is interested in developing software needed to 
monitor satellites because one of the Arabsats is monitored from 
Tunis, Safra said. 
  The Tunisian official also said his country is planning its 
first nuclear research center to promote the peaceful use of 
nuclear technology for medical, agricultural and industrial 
purposes. 
  "And we hope South Korea will help us by sending experts to 
give us advice on building nuclear laboratories, which are 
urgently needed," he said. 
  Although some private South Korean companies are already 
operating in Tunisia, Safra's visit marks the first big 
commitment to establish bilateral technological ties at an 
official level. 
  During his stay here, Safra visited Taedok Science Town and 
six research institutes, including the Korea Institute of 
Science and Technology, to discuss an exchange of researchers. 
  Korea International Cooperation Agency has agreed to offer 
three scholarships for Tunisian researchers to attend seminars 
and study in research institutes here. 
  "This cooperation on the official level will certainly help 
lay the foundation for more cooperation in the private sector," 
Safra said. 
  Samsung is already in Tunisia assembling microcomputers and 
Goldstar is producing household electric appliances there. 
  For foreign investors, there could be little doubt about the 
importance of Tunisia's geographical location, Safra said. The 
North African region has 60 million people and Europe is 
directly across the Mediterranean Sea. 
  "By being in Tunisia, foreign companies will be in a 
position 
not only to expand into the North African market but also to use 
it as a gateway to the European market," Safra said. 
  Tunisia plans to open two free trade zones this year where 
foreign investors can work without any taxes and use cheap local 
labor on a contract basis so that they will not have to pay 
social taxes or comply with local labor regulations. 
  As long as the local value added is more than 40 percent of 
the value of a product, the product is considered Tunisian, and 
almost all Tunisian products get free access to the European 
market except for a few agricultural products. 
  Safra leaves the country today. His visit here included a 
meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, where he said 
he made clear his country's position that every country in the 
world, including North Korea, must allow nuclear inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tunisia is a 
member of the board of IAEA.

  [Text] France has offered to revive the agreement for a 
nuclear power plant. The offer is under consideration at the 
highest level. This was stated by Shahid Hasan, the prime 
minister's special assistant on economic affairs, at a news 
conference in Islamabad yesterday. He said that the French 
Government had started talks in which an offer was made to 
revive an agreement on the nuclear power plant, which was signed 
during the previous Pakistan People's Party government.

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Stober] </F>
  [Text] The MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN is this week able to print 
the 
details of a court case the government has kept hidden for five 
years, revealing that President F.W. de Klerk was not telling 
the full truth when he revealed South Africa's nuclear weapons 
programme last year. 
  The court records of the trial of Brigadier Johann Blaauw in 
1989 show that De Klerk's statement to parliament contained 
three direct lies about South Africa's collaboration with other 
countries in the nuclear programme. It also indicates that he 
underplayed the extent of the programme when he told of the 
existence of no more than six crude atomic bombs. The record 
also puts on display the level of corruption in the government 
in the 1980's, allowing former minister of mines Fanie Botha, a 
perpetual insolvent, to sit in parliament and the cabinet and 
even serve as leader of the House. Judge J. Friedman said that 
in order to hide his state of affairs Botha was "prepared to 
commit perjury, fraud and deceit; he was prepared to become 
involved in political chicanery of the most despicable kind ... 
he was prepared to lie to the prosecutor ... he was prepared to 
lie deliberately under oath ... no reliance can be placed on his 
evidence." 
  Botha was later jailed for one year. Transcripts of the 
trial confirm South Africa and Israel collaborated on the 
development of nuclear weapons -- and prove De Klerk lied on 
three counts: 
  -- He stated South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons 
technology or material from another country. 
  -- He stated that South Africa had never provided material 
to 
another country. 
  -- He stated that South Africa had never co-operated with 
another country in this regard. 
  The September 1989 Supreme Court judgment, in the "in 
camera" 
case of former South African Air Force [SAAF] Brigadier Blaauw, 
reveals startling details of South African-Israeli swaps of 
nuclear weapon technology and material and extensive 
collaboration between the two. Until now reporting on the 
judgment has been banned under the Nuclear Energy Act and the 
Criminal Procedure Act. As recently as last week, the 
government tried to block the story threatening the SUNDAY TIMES 
with an interdict if it printed it. 
  In October 1987, Blaauw was charged with attempting to 
extort 
mining concessions from Botha, by threatening to reveal that he 
was financially bankrupt. During the trail it emerged that 
Blaauw had in fact shored up Botha's finances with the help of 
the Israelis and brokered many of the key nuclear deals between 
South Africa and Israel. Blaauw was found not guilty on all 
charges. 
  After his retirement from the SAAF in 1975, Blaauw acted as 
a 
go- between for Israel and South Africa on military matters. In 
1976, he was approached by a member of an Israeli council 
involved in the clandestine purchase of nuclear materials and 
asked to obtain South African "yellow cake" for Israel. Yellow 
cake is an uranium oxide which, when enriched, can be used for 
the production of nuclear weapons. 
  Blaauw got agreement for the sale of 50 [metric] tons of 
yellow cake from the then prime minister B.J. Vorster, and the 
former head of the Bureau of State security, Hendrik van den 
Bergh, despite resistance from the then minister of mines, Piet 
Koornhof. Koornhof was replaced by Botha who was instructed to 
ensure the deal went through. Blaauw arranged a tour of Israeli 
military installations for Botha and the Israelis quickly struck 
up a good relationship with Botha. 
  Said the judgment: "Blaauw testified that there was, at that 
stage, a high degree of confidence developing between the South 
African and Israeli governments which involved the exchange of 
military technology, joint aeronautic ventures and the supply of 
`knowhow' by Israel to South Africa in regard to the manufacture 
of weaponry." 
  After the yellow cake deal went through, Blaauw was asked by 
Van den Bergh to see if Israel would supply tritium to South 
Africa. Tritium boosts the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The 
Israelis agreed to supply 30g of tritium to South Africa -- 
enough for 12 atomic bombs. In exchange, South Africa delivered 
two more consignments of yellow cake, of 50 [metric] tons and 
500 [metric] tons, to Israel. 
  Details of the transactions are recorded in CRITICAL MASS, a 
recently published book by William Burrows and Robert Windrem, 
which investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons among 
developing countries. While the deals were going through, Botha 
slid into bankruptcy and his political career was threatened by 
a R[rand]1.7-million overdraft he owed Volkskas. But help was 
at hand. 
  Said the judgment: "The Israelis were interested in keeping 
Botha in the portfolio of mines because the yellow cake 
transactions had not yet fully materialised. There was every 
possibility of Botha becoming the minister of defence and they 
would have preferred Botha to hold that portfolio." 
  The Israelis gave Blaauw $1-million -- then worth R800,000 
-- 
as a "gift for what I had done for them." With the money, 
Blaauw gave Botha cash transfusions and kept him financially and 
politically alive. Blaauw and Botha fell out after Botha failed 
to deliver valuable mining concessions promised to Blaauw as a 
reward for his services to South Africa's nuclear programme, in 
July 1979. 
  In court, Botha alleged Blaauw attempted to force him to 
hand 
over the concessions by threatening to reveal details of Botha's 
illegal attempts to get evidence of corruption from his rivals 
in the struggle for the leadership of the National Party, after 
the fall of Vorster in 1979. 
  In his speech to parliament in March last year, when he 
announced he had ordered the dismantling of South Africa's 
nuclear arsenal, De Klerk baldly stated: "I wish to emphasise 
that at no time did South Africa acquire nuclear weapons 
technology or materials from another country, nor has it 
provided any to any other country, or co-operated with another 
country in this regard." 
  When confronted with the court records by the international 
London based magazine, AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, which first broke 
the story, the office of the state president replied: "South 
Africa did not acquire nuclear weapons technology from another 
country. Although tritium many be used in initiators of nuclear 
explosive devices, (although not in the devices produced by 
South Africa) it has many other commercial uses. South Africa 
has been active in the commercial exploitation of tritium for 
some time and has procured this material from various sources in 
the past." 
  Despite De Klerk's 1993 announcement, details of South 
Africa's nuclear programme remain shrouded in secrecy. Said ANC 
[African National Congress] science and technology head Roger 
Jardine: "They are prepared to give a tour of the complex but 
have never given details of the programme. A senior official 
once offered to tell me everything -- but only if I signed the 
Official Secrets Act."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 15 February 
carry articles discussing the North Korean stance in connection 
with its nuclear issue with the 21 February International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting approaching, 
which reportedly would lead to referring the issue to the UN 
Security Council and then to sanctions on North Korea by the UN 
Security Council. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO on 15 February carries on page 
4 
a 1,000-word article by Ottawa-based correspondent Pak Tu-sik 
entitled "North Korean Nuclear Issue Heading for the UN Security 
Council -- China and Japan Openly Revealing Their Intention of 
Seeking Practical Profit." The article refers to the remark 
made by Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa at the U.S.-Japanese 
summit talks held in Washington on 11 February. He is quoted as 
saying: "If the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN 
Security Council, Japan will cooperate with the United Nations 
within the scope that our local laws permit." The article notes 
that Japan's attitude in attaching a string to the issue 
suggests that Japan is seeking a reward for its cooperation with 
the United Nations in dealing with the North Korean nuclear 
issue. The article then notes the Chinese position of delaying 
the UN Security Council's moves toward resolving the North 
Korean nuclear issue and says, "China makes it clear that China 
does not want the UN Security Council to take up the issue 
directly. China may not want the North Korean nuclear issue to 
be referred to the United Nations, which may well create a 
crisis near China and expose the Chinese position to the 
judgment of the international arena. Meanwhile, it is also true 
that China regards the present situation as a golden opportunity 
to expand its influence on the Sino-U.S. relations and on the 
Korean peninsula." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 2 a 
600- word article dispatched by reporter Chong Pyong-chin from 
Washington in the "Reporter's Eye" column entitled "Facsimile 
Dispatched by Ho Chong." The article notes two different pieces 
of North Korean reactions reaching the ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu's Washington field camp dealing with the North Korean 
nuclear issue around noon on 13 February [EST], one being the 
North Korean NODONG SINMUN and Central Broadcast's bellicose 
warning "We will regard any sanctions and pressure on Korea as 
an act of war provocation," and the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's negotiation-seeking comment "The U.S. 
Government should make clear its correct position toward the 
third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks." The article notes that Ho 
Chong, North Korean representative to the United Nations, sent 
facsimile of the latter, namely, the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman's comment, to the news agencies and even to 
the residences of correspondents from around the world in 
Washington. The article notes that North Korea did not show 
such a kindness for the former, namely, the NODONG SINMUN and 
the Central Broadcast's warning. The article concludes, "We may 
be able to discern the North Korean `nuclear strategy' from the 
behavior of the North Korean UN mission distributing door to 
door the `proposal aimed at negotiation,' instead of the 
`warning,' with the deadline for the UN Security Council 
decision on sanctions approaching only several days away, timing 
it with the ROK foreign minister's visit to the United States." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 5 a 
1,300-word article by Ottawa-based correspondent Chong 
Pyong-chin entitled "What Is the True Intent of the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry Spokesman's Comment -- North Korea Tries To Get 
Open Confirmation of Its Behind-the-Scenes Agreement With the 
United States." The article notes the meaning of the North 
Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment issued on 12 
February and says: "the ROK and the United States regard it as 
the North Korean proposal that the United States confirm the 
secretive and intermittent exchange of views between the United 
States and North Korea." The article goes on to note the 
remarks by an ROK Government official who accompanied Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu on his visit to the United States, who is 
quoted as saying: "We think that North Korea openly asked for 
the card which the ROK and the United States was going to 
present. This seems to be the North Korean intention of leading 
the situation positively rather than negatively." The article 
then notes, "North Korea is, in fact, asking the United States 
to help North Korea establish its justification for its own 
people at home, in allowing the IAEA inspection team to visit 
North Korea, that the inspection team could come to North Korea 
because of its own good will" rather than being forced by the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty obligations. The article also 
notes that North Korea wants to have the U.S.-North Korean 
behind-the-scenes exchange of views notarized so that it can 
secure the anticipated fruits if the third round of U.S.-North 
Korean talks are held." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on 15 February carries on page 5 a 
900- word article by reporter Yu Sung-u entitled "Why Is North 
Korea So Indecisive Between Hardline and Dialogue? -- Hardline 
and Moderate Negotiation Strategy Utilizing Time Before 
International Sanctions." The article notes the background 
behind North Korea's sending two different messages one after 
the other in connection with its nuclear issue, that is, while 
it maintained a stiff stance for some time on the nuclear 
inspection by the IAEA, North Korea hinted on the possibility of 
resolving the issue through dialogue at the last minute. The 
article notes, "Some North Korean watchers believe that North 
Korea takes this position because it thinks there is still some 
time left before actual sanctions are taken." The article then 
notes the opinion of another group of watchers that says that 
"North Korean President Kim Il-song may have tentatively taken 
back the authority on diplomacy and economy from his son Kim 
Chong-il to institute the authority himself. This may have 
caused the issuance of the apparently conflicting messages." 
The article notes the opinion of yet another group of watchers 
that says "North Korea is trying to fully use the time before 
the actual sanctions are taken," because it could still use the 
double tactic of negotiation of hawk and dove before the 
sanctions can actually produce effects. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 4 an 800-word 
article entitled "The Last U.S. Persuasion To the North" by 
correspondent Nam Chan-sun from Washington. 
  The article reports that the United States is making its 
final persuasive move through the North Korean mission in the 
United Nations and the PRC is also doing everything possible to 
join the effort to persuade North Korea. The article reports 
that such persuasive efforts are based on the analysis that 
North Korea values the clue for dialogue [taehwaui pulssi] as 
has been revealed through the remarks of a North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman on 12 February. 
  The article notes the fact that most conditions except one 
or 
two were agreed upon between North Korea and the IAEA and that 
the ROK foreign minister's "appeal" during his recent U.S. visit 
encouraged the United States to continue to be persuasive. 
  The article notes that "persuasion does not mean any more 
concession but is focused on having North Korea realize the 
situation after the nuclear issue is referred to the UN Security 
Council." 
  The article reports that the ROK Government is criticized 
for 
having weakened the "stick character" of the persuasion by 
announcing that it will continue dialogue with Pyongyang even 
after the North Korean nuclear issue is referred to the UN 
Security Council. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 
1,200-word article by correspondent Yang Sung-hyon from Ottawa. 
  Comparing the two communications made by North Korea on 12 
February -- the hard-line toned NODONG SINMUN commentary and the 
moderate remarks of a Foreign Ministry spokesman -- the article 
reports that the government analyzes the former as "for domestic 
use" targeting the hard-liners and public opinion inside North 
Korea, and the latter as a message to the international 
community. 
  The article analyzes that "ROK Foreign Minister Han's visit 
to the United States provided North Korea with a pretext for 
changing its direction" and adds that government officials 
believe there is a great possibility that North Korean 
working-level officials reported such moves of the ROK and the 
United States as an "achievement of the Republic's demand." 
  The article notes that it is still too early to be 
optimistic 
because the United State and the IAEA have yet to assess North 
Korea's true intentions and North Korea has to confirm with the 
IAEA if the IAEA's expression of "inspections for the continuity 
of safeguards" coincides with North Korea's demands. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 
700-word 
entitled "Attention on North Korea's Last Nuclear Card" by 
correspondent Yi Sung-chol from Ottawa. 
  The article notes that ROK and U.S. officials agree that 
North Korea will soon suggest the resumption of dialogue with 
the United States and that the attention is focused on when and 
what the contents will be. 
  The article quotes an ROK Government official as saying: 
"analyzing the 12 February remarks of the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, North Korea is focusing on facilitating 
pretexts rather than insisting on their demands." 
  The article reports the official also added that North Korea 
has finally realized that it is impossible for the United States 
to pressure IAEA more to ease inspection conditions. 
  The article reports the ROK and U.S. authorities are 
discussing the optimum level of pretexts available to the 
expected demands from North Korea. 
  As to the timing, the article reports that related officials 
expect North Korea will request the United States to hold a 
dialogue on 19 February at the latest and that a high-ranking 
ROK Government official expects that the IAEA's resolution to 
refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council 
will be adopted on 23 February. 
  The article reports the ROK and U.S. Governments are 
studying 
countermeasures based on three assumptions before 19 February: 
First, when North Korea expresses its willingness to accept 
nuclear inspections; Second, when the nuclear inspections begin; 
Third, when no agreement is reached. 
  The article reports that an ROK Government authority said if 
North Korea agrees to accept nuclear inspection, there is a 
great possibility that the United Nations will adopt a 
resolution to impose sanctions with a deadline for nuclear 
inspections.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation from 17 
February ROK vernacular newspapers on reactions to North Korea's 
acceptance of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] and prospects for future developments in 
this issue. This topic is covered extensively by the vernacular 
press with The CHOSON ILBO, TONG-A ILBO, HANGUK ILBO, KYONGHYANG 
SINMUN, SEOUL SINMUN, and HANGYORE SINMUN all carrying 
responsive editorials and articles analyzing future development 
prospects. 
<H5>  Reactions </H5>
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO, TONG-A ILBO, and HANGUK ILBO 
newspapers carry 800-word editorials on page 3 welcoming North 
Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections but caution that 
although the emergency atmosphere has dissipated on the Korean 
peninsula due to North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspection, 
it is too early in the negotiation process to expect too much 
from North Korea. 
  Pointing out that "the nuclear issue began with the IAEA's 
demand for special inspections [tukpyol sachal]," the CHOSON 
ILBO editorial entitled "No More Nuclear Games," says that "ad 
hoc and ordinary inspections [imsi mit tongsang sachal] on seven 
declared facilities are meaningless" and that "the developments 
in the nuclear issue will only be possible following special 
inspections." The editorial warns that if North Korea accepted 
the inspections to avoid UN Security Council's sanctions, it 
will only add to its image of being "an impossible country to 
deal with" and urges North Korea to keep in mind the "economic 
benefits" that are to be gained from the resolution of the 
nuclear issue. The editorial concludes by telling readers to 
wait until North Korea accepts special and mutual inspections 
[sangho sachal] between the North and the South. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO editorial entitled "Still A Long 
Way 
To Go To Resolve North Korea's Nuclear Issue" chimes in with 
CHOSON ILBO by saying that "real negotiations begin when the 
issues of special inspection on two undeclared facilities and 
mutual inspections [sangho sachal] between the North and the 
South are discussed at the third round of the U.S.-North Korea 
talks," but adds that developments prove that North Korea only 
takes action when faced with "resolute measures [tanohan 
taecho]." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO editorial entitled "While 
Catastrophe Has Been Avoided on the North Korean Nuclear Issue" 
says that "although North Korea's avoidance of catastrophe and 
economic sanctions is to be praised, ... this does not mean a 
complete resolution of the nuclear issue." The editorial urges 
the government to be fully prepared for North Korea's tricks as 
the sudden change is part of a "meticulous, premeditated plan." 
  HANGUK ILBO's 800-word article by Paris correspondent Han 
Ki-pong on page 2, in analyzing the implications of the long 
drawn-out negotiations process, says that "no progress has been 
made from the starting point of negotiations a year ago," but 
that the resolution of conflict between North Korea and the 
international community is important in and of itself. 
  HANGUK ILBO carries an 800-word article by Choe Kyu-sik on 
page 4 on the ROK Government's view on North Korea's acceptance 
of nuclear inspections. While finding North Korea's decision 
"fortunate and welcoming," the government expressed its position 
that it is too early to be optimistic. The article says that 
the government hopes to have meaningful development in 
working-level contacts concerning the exchange of special envoys 
and to lead North Korea to completely return to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] system following a successful 
third round of U.S.-North Korea talks regarding the special 
inspections [tukpyol sachal] of the two undeclared facilities. 
While the government does not interpret North Korea's 
acceptance of inspections to mean complete abandonment of 
nuclear development, it is not being interpreted as "a temporary 
step" to get out of the recent emergency situation, but as one 
official put it, "a meaningful breakthrough." This official is 
said to have noted that "it is a considerable development that 
North Korea accepted ad hoc inspections [imsi sachal] on two 
facilities when it had only allowed replacement of batteries and 
films." 
  On page 5, HANGUK ILBO carries a 700-word article by Yu 
Sung-u noting the two interpretations among relevant government 
officials on North Korea's acceptance of inspections: One, that 
it is part of a long-term negotiation strategy, and two, that 
there has been a sudden change in power structure within North 
Korea. Supporters of the former theory feel that North Korea's 
concession was planned to prevent the resumption of Team Spirit 
and that "it may be short-sighted to analyze that North Korea 
changed its attitude because it felt pressured by the 21 
February deadline." Those who support the latter view note that 
while the declaration to withdraw from the NPT and the 
proclamation of a semi-war state in North Korea were done in Kim 
Chong-il's name, measures to settle the situation have been done 
in Kim Il-song's name. The article speculates that Kim Il-song 
may have chosen to involve himself in the settlement process 
after judging Kim Chong-il's management of diplomatic and 
economic affairs to have failed and concludes by saying that the 
issue of succession of power remains uncertain. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 
an 800-word editorial entitled "The Problem of Inspections on 
North Korea's Nuclear Facilities Starts Now." The editorial 
welcomes North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections as 
evidence that North Korea wants to avoid serious confrontation 
with international society due to the nuclear issue. The 
editorial reports, however, that "the problem is how sincerely 
North Korea will accept IAEA inspections in the future," noting 
that there have been differences of opinion between the IAEA and 
North Korea regarding procedural matters on inspections, 
including its form and scope. 
  Noting that North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear 
inspections is "nothing but a beginning" and "it is no more than 
returning to the situation one year ago when North Korea 
declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, NPT," the editorial stresses that "in a sense, North 
Korea's acceptance has no new, special meaning other than just 
the start of discussions on the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  The editorial urges North Korea to allow the IAEA to inspect 
all nuclear facilities, including undeclared sites in Yongbyon 
and, at the same time, stresses the need for the United States 
and the IAEA to continue negotiations with Pyongyang "with a 
consistent principle." The editorial concludes that "the 
government should realize that if it continues its policy toward 
North Korea and its nuclear policy with an irresolute and 
inconsistent attitude, the people's unrest will intensify." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 
3 
an 800-word editorial entitled: "North-South Dialogue Should 
Also Be Resumed." While defining North Korea's acceptance of 
nuclear inspections this time and the IAEA's announcement to 
send its inspection team to Pyongyang soon as "a dramatic 
solution," the editorial notes that North Korea failed to 
mention if the two undeclared sites in Yongbyon -- which are 
under suspicion of storing liquid and solid nuclear fuel -- will 
be inspected this time. The editorial analyzes that North 
Korea's acceptance does not mean a solution to the North Korean 
nuclear issue, but means a start to its solution, stressing that 
success of the issue depends entirely on North Korea's attitude. 
  The editorial notes that "now that North Korea has agreed to 
IAEA full-scope inspection, the only remaining problem is to 
resume a meaningful dialogue between North and South Korea to 
discuss mutual inspections between the North and the South to 
confirm denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." 
  The editorial concludes that North Korea, which has thus far 
adhered to dialogue with the United States, should correctly 
understand the need for North-South dialogue, adding that "North 
Korea should be aware that the improvement of its relations with 
the United States cannot be achieved without South Korea's 
consent." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 
3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "The North Korean Nuclear 
Issue Has Passed the Crisis Stage." The editorial notes that 
North Korea's decision on 16 February to accept the IAEA demand 
for nuclear inspections is a "blitzkrieg" decision and that 
"with this the North Korean nuclear issue, which was heading 
toward a crisis stage, was defused for a while." 
  Enumerating the ominous moves of the recent months in 
connection with the North Korean nuclear issue -- such as tense 
North Korean- IAEA relations, the dispatch of a U.S. national 
intelligence team to South Korea, the announcement of U.S. plans 
to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to South 
Korea, the plan to resume the Team Spirit exercise, the 
preparations for referring the North Korean nuclear issue to the 
UN Security Council, and North Korea's reactions to these moves 
-- the editorial notes that "these were indeed shocking moves 
for those directly related to the nuclear issue and who live in 
the southern part of the peninsula." The editorial then 
appraises our government's efforts to prevent a crisis of war on 
the peninsula, indicating Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's recent 
meetings with U.S. Government officials. The editorial expresses 
the hope for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. 
  HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 2 a 900-word article by 
Kim 
Tae-ho analyzing the prospects for the North Korean nuclear 
issue in the wake of North Korea's acceptance of IAEA 
inspections. Quoting an official concerned at the National 
Unification Board, NUB, as commenting that "now the first button 
has been fastened," the article reports that the NUB official's 
comment has two implications: One is that negotiations for the 
nuclear issue as a whole will be smoother in the future and the 
other is that North Korea's acceptance is just a new start. 
  The article stresses that the resumption of North-South 
dialogue depends on whether the Team Spirit exercise is 
suspended. The article also analyzes that North Korea will 
probably demand not only the suspension of the exercise, but 
also the renouncement of the international cooperative system 
against North Korea in connection with the nuclear issue in 
return for the realization of exchanges of North-South special 
envoys. The article stresses the need not to persistently 
adhere to a solution of the nuclear issue as we see it today, 
but to first promote economic and personnel exchanges between 
the North and the South. 
<H5>  Prospects </H5>
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean carries on page 4 a 
1,000-word article by Yi Sung-u on prospects for North-South 
relations following North Korea's acceptance of nuclear 
inspections. Noting that the ROK Government is busy preparing 
necessary actions for resumption of North-South contacts, the 
article reports the government is optimistic that contacts will 
be resumed and yet assumes a prudent attitude that no 
significant progress will be made soon. 
  The article notes that as North Korea employed a 
foot-dragging tactic, the government assumed a flexible attitude 
in accordance with North Korea's reactions. Recalling that 
unification-related ministers met on 25 January and confirmed 
the government position that the nuclear impasse will be broken 
only when the North fully returns to the NPT, accepts 
substantial inspections by the IAEA, and basically agrees on 
South-North mutual nuclear inspections, the article predicts 
"chances are high that the government will flexibly readjust its 
stance in accordance with how IAEA inspections and North 
Korean-U.S. contacts will proceed." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries a 
1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong 
Chin-sok on prospects for North Korean-U.S. relations. The 
article reports "North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections 
does not mean that nuclear transparency has been guaranteed. 
However, the North Korean nuclear issue has entered a new stage 
in which chances for a crisis on the Korean peninsula have been 
diminished to some extent and the safety-valve of the nuclear 
issue has been sealed." 
  The article reports that there are numerous diplomatic, 
political, and legal obstacles that should be overcome for the 
promotion of North Korean-U.S. relations. The article predicts 
that even if high-level U.S.-North Korean dialogue is resumed, 
there is a great possibility that relatively slow progress will 
be made in the issues of suspending the Team Spirit exercise and 
promoting ties because the nuclear issue has not been cleared 
from the agenda. 
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,200-word 
article by Pak Tu-sik entitled "How Things Will Turn Out After 
North Korea's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections." Noting that 
North Korea has defused the crisis over the nuclear issue by 
accepting IAEA inspections, the article predicts that North 
Korean-U.S. negotiations or North Korean-Japanese negotiations 
will start in the first half of this year if progress is made at 
the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  The article questions if inter-Korean contacts for the 
exchange of special envoys can take place smoothly. The article 
points out that the "two sides should lower the level of their 
demands." 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean carries on page 2 an 
1,200-word article by Nam Chan-chong entitled: "How the Third 
U.S.-DPRK Talks Will Evolve." 
  Noting the future obstacles of U.S.-DPRK talks, the article 
reports that "to remove these obstacles, North Korea must allow 
the IAEA inspection team to inspect thoroughly its seven 
reported nuclear facilities and the exchange of special envoys 
between the North and South must be carried out." 
  The article reports that "the ROK and the United States will 
announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise this weekend 
when the IAEA inspection team arrives in Pyongyang," noting an 
agreement reached between North Korea and the United States at 
their 18th working-level contact held in New York on 29 December 
1993. 
  Referring to the U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles to 
South 
Korea as a new agenda item in the negotiations between North 
Korea and the United States, the article reports: "Although the 
United States says that it will deploy Patriot missiles to South 
Korea for defensive purposes, Pyongyang will make it a issue at 
the meeting with the U.S. side." Noting the possibility of the 
U.S. cancellation of its plan to deploy the Patriots, the 
article reports that "Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has said 
that the ROK and the United States decided to discuss it after 
21 February." 
  TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 1,000-word article by Pak 
Che- kyun entitled: "The Situation After North Korea's 
Acceptance of Nuclear Inspection." Referring to the ROK role in 
North Korean-U.S. talks and in North Korean-IAEA contacts, the 
article reports: "The resumption of North-South dialogue is 
getting closer as the IAEA inspection team is allowed to travel 
to North Korea this weekend." 
  Referring to the need to settle the simultaneous North-South 
inspection issue by the North and South themselves after IAEA 
special inspections are conducted, the article urges the 
government to actively strengthen cooperation with the United 
States to make North Korea aware of the importance of the 
improvement of North- South relations in order to improve 
U.S.-North Korean relations. The article continues that "some 
government officials say that the government must show its new 
negotiating card, such as the North- South economic cooperation 
card, to realize North-South dialogue." 
  TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 900-word article by Kim 
Cha-su entitled: "The Background and Prospects of North Korea's 
Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections." The article reports: "It 
is very successful to confirm North Korea's attitude to resolve 
the nuclear issue through dialogue," referring to the 
government's preparations to respond to North Korea's acceptance 
of nuclear inspections. Noting the background of North Korea's 
acceptance of the nuclear inspections, the article reports that 
"North Korea accepted the inspections a day before Kim 
Chong-il's birthday, and that this is intended to attract 
international recognition of the Kim Chong-il power system by 
creating an atmosphere in which North Korea gives a gift to the 
international community." 
  TONG-A ILBO carries on page 4 a 400-word article by Yi 
Chin-yong entitled: "The Prospects for IAEA Nuclear Inspection 
of North Korea." Referring to the need to inspect the two 
undeclared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon to clearly dispel the 
suspicion of North Korea's nuclear weapon development, the 
article reports that "this issue is likely to be discussed at 
the upcoming U.S.-DPRK high-level talks." Noting the background 
of North Korea's refusal to accept IAEA inspections and its 
decision to withdraw from the NPT, the article concludes that 
"it will take a long time to even confirm the result of the 
inspections. Therefore, it is too early to be optimistic over 
the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  The leftist-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean carries on 
page 
3 an 1,000-word article by Pak Chong-mun entitled: "North 
Korea, South Korea, and the United States Stopped at the Edge of 
a Precipice." Referring to Vice Foreign Minister Hong 
Sun-yong's remarks that "North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA 
nuclear inspection is only the beginning to the resolution of 
the nuclear issue," the article points out several complicated 
problems in the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Referring to the IAEA upcoming inspections as an opportunity 
for maintaining the continuity of nuclear safeguards and for 
guaranteeing the transparency of future nuclear inspection 
activities, the article predicts that "North Korea will 
cooperate with the IAEA inspection team in order to improve 
relations with the United States in the future."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of an 
editorial and articles published on the moderate vernacular 
daily CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 16 February on North Korea's 
"lightning acceptance" of nuclear inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The paper publishes on page 3 a 2,300-word article by 
Vienna- 
based correspondent Yu Chae-sik, entitled "Strategic Concession 
Fearing International Pressure -- Also Can Be Intentional Delay 
Tactic To Gain `a Lot.'" Noting that North Korea on 15 February 
informed the IAEA of its decision to "accept nuclear 
inspections" in a "lightning manner," the article says that with 
this, tensions regarding "the crisis of a war breaking," which 
has been openly talked about by the people, have now been 
"calmed down for a while." 
  The article points out several observations made by relevant 
IAEA officials in Vienna concerning the background of "North 
Korea's abrupt turn around" from the position of refusal of 
inspections. First, North Korea "yielded to the tough pressure" 
of the international community, of the United States, in 
particular. Explaining the process of the past contacts between 
the United States and North Korea on the inspection issue, the 
article says that an agreement was reached between the two sides 
but there was no "progress" in the six contacts held between 
North Korea and IAEA owing to differences in positions on the 
scope of the inspections. The IAEA declared that if normal 
inspections of "seven nuclear facilities" are not accepted, it 
will not dispatch an inspection team to North Korea. Prompted by 
this, "voices for sanctions on North Korea" and "criticism" of 
the Clinton Administration's "moderate policy" began to "surge." 
Pointing to the U.S. Defense Department's announcement of its 
operational plan to "occupy Pyongyang" and to the U.S. "final 
notice" on referring the issue to the UN Security Council, the 
article notes that this situation has driven North Korea to 
keenly realize that it can "no longer endure" the situation and 
that it may "loose" even what it has already gained. North Korea 
is also clearly aware that the United States has become the only 
"superpower" of the world which will "put its decision into 
practice without fail" once it decides to do so. 
  Second, the acceptance of inspections at the "final stage" 
is 
North Korea's "original strategy." In other words, even after 
North Korea agreed to accept inspections of "seven facilities," 
it is attempting to "gain some more" during negotiations with 
the United States. Judging that nothing can be obtained from 
"seven declared facilities," North Korea made a "strategic 
concession" in order to prepare itself for high-level talks with 
the United States while continuing the dialogue. 
  The article says that another observation which should not 
be 
overlooked is that North Korea agreed on inspections because the 
IAEA made "a certain concession," as revealed by North Korean 
Councilor Yun Ho-chin. If this is true, the article says, the 
IAEA might have decided to apply special regulations only to 
North Korea, not the "general regulation" which is applied to 
all IAEA members, thus leaving room for "making an issue" among 
its member states. 
  The article stresses that North Korea's acceptance of 
inspections is significant because it "halted the two trains 
dashing toward each other" but it is only the "beginning" of the 
North Korean nuclear issue because more thoroughgoing 
negotiations should be held between North Korea and the United 
States and between North Korea and the IAEA in order to ensure 
"transparency" of the North Korean nuclear issue through 
"special inspections" of two undeclared facilities in Yongbyon. 
  The paper publishes on page 3 a 1,300-word article by 
Washington- based correspondent Chin Chang-uk entitled "The 
United States Is Embarrassed by the Entanglement of Its Policy 
on North Korea." The article says that although the United 
States "immediately" announced a statement on 15 February 
"welcoming" North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections, it 
cannot conceal its "embarrassment" for the "abrupt entanglement" 
of its policies on North Korea, noting that the United States, 
judging that North Korea would not accept inspections until the 
IAEA Board of Governors meeting on 21 February, worked out 
"concrete measures" for economic sanctions against North Korea 
by referring the inspection issue to the UN Security Council. 
  The article says that the U.S. embarrassment is shown by its 
difficulty in deciding whether it would deploy Patriot missiles 
to the ROK or not and it has stated that an "urgent revision to 
the plan" to stage the 1994 Team Spirit joint military exercise 
is "necessary" in the event that the IAEA inspection team visits 
North Korea in the future. The article says that the United 
States should also make a "difficult diplomatic reversal" of its 
discussions with permanent member states of the UN Security 
Council because it had already discussed with them "sanctions 
against North Korea." 
  On the other hand, the article goes on to say that the U.S. 
Government believes that a series of such "hardline measures" 
have had the effect of making North Korea accept nuclear 
inspections. However, it also thinks that a "drastic revision" 
in the direction of its policies toward North Korea will be 
necessary. The article notes that it is likely that the United 
States will strongly demand that North Korea accept the 
inspection of "two undeclared nuclear facilities" in addition to 
the issue of exchanging special envoys between North and South 
Korea. The article says that whether the United States will 
deploy Patriot missiles to the Korean peninsula or not, even 
after North Korea accepts nuclear inspection, will become "a 
point of contention" between the United States and North Korea. 
  The paper published on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial 
entitled 
"The North's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspection Is Only the 
Beginning." Noting North Korea's acceptance of inspections as 
"fortunate," the editorial says that this is only a "clue" to 
the solution of the problem and that North Korea will demand 
discussions of "economic assistance and improved relations" by 
holding the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks. 
The paper stresses that a "satisfactory result" should be 
brought about by the IAEA inspection and "peaceful use" of North 
Korean nuclear facilities must be "confirmed." The editorial 
also emphasizes that "practical dialogue" between the North and 
the South should be held before the issues of suspending the 
Team Spirit exercise and of holding high- level U.S.-North Korea 
talks are discussed.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials from ROK vernacular newspapers published 
on 14 February on the future of the North Korean nuclear issue 
following the remarks made by a spokesman of the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry on 12 February and ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu's recent visit to the United States. 
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word article by correspondent Pak Tu-sik from Washington 
on the possibility of a new turn in the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  Reviewing the contents point by point, the article analyzes 
that the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's 12 February 
comment implies another new turn in the North Korean nuclear 
issue, which has been aggravated since a statement was issued by 
a spokesman of North Korean Foreign Ministry on 31 January. 
  The article says that although it cannot be expected that 
the 
North Korean nuclear issue will be resolved through dialogue by 
21 February, it notes: "it has been confirmed that North Korea 
does want a breakthrough of the current situation which could 
only result in UN Security Council's measures." 
  The article notes North Korea's sudden assertion that it 
received "new facts" that the United States is willing to 
continue dialogue and that the inspections of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are purely for the continuity of 
safeguards -- while the two conditions are not new at all -- are 
to "accumulate pretexts for internal reporting procedures." 
  The article concludes that the behind-the-scenes 
communications between the United States and North Korea in the 
remainder of the week will be noteworthy. 
  The moderate CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 an 
800- word editorial on the follow-up measures on the nuclear 
issue. 
  The editorial says "if it is inevitable to seek resolutions 
in the frame of sanctions instead of negotiations, the 
government should clearly convey to North Korea that the 
sanctions are not threats but a reality, and should be prepared 
to clearly interpret North Korea's response." 
  Therefore, the editorial urges that a communications channel 
is established to quickly communicate our decision to the top 
decision maker in North Korea in order to prevent a crisis 
resulting from delayed communications. 
  If this does not work out, the editorial says crisis 
management measures should be sought at this stage. The 
editorial stresses that the most important thing at this stage 
is to cautiously manage the domestic systems in the ROK and the 
United States so that a prudent countermeasure to minimize the 
crisis can be carried out with a national consensus of opinion. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a 
600-word article by correspondent Nam Chang-sun from Washington 
entitled "Main Role and Supporting Role in Handling the North 
Korean Nuclear Issue." 
  Noting that there had been frequent contacts between South 
and North Korea a year ago for the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula, the article regrets that now the nuclear issue 
has become an issue to be resolved between North Korea and the 
United States or the IAEA. 
  The article analyzes that North Korea succeeded to exclude 
South Korea from the issue because "it was aware of the effects 
and limits of South Korea's carrots and sticks and disregarded 
them." 
  The article says Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's hasty visit 
to the United States to pull back the Clinton Administration 
from rushing into a hard-line position and to "confirm" that the 
U.S. policy on the North Korean nuclear issue was the same as 
ours, vividly shows the ROK's supporting role. 
  The article asserts that we should seek a way to play the 
main role in the North Korean nuclear issue because it is 
directly linked with our destiny. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 
a 1,400-word article by correspondent Yi Sung-chol from 
Washington analyzing the possibility of a breakthrough in the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The article notes that the comment made by a spokesman of 
North Korean Foreign Ministry was announced on the same day 
NODONG SINMUN carried a hard-line commentary that any sanctions 
will be regarded as a proclamation of war, and quotes an ROK 
Government official as saying: "the NODONG SINMUN commentary 
and Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment can be analyzed as a 
fake operation." 
  The article reports North Korea seemed to have put 
considerable emphasis on the Foreign Ministry spokesman's 
comment because it even distributed copies of the contents to 
ROK and Western correspondents in the United States. 
  The article analyzes that "such a move of change resulted 
from the North Korean leaders' crisis awareness" as well as "the 
ROK Foreign Minister's efforts during his recent visit to the 
United States to create an atmosphere for North Korea's change." 
  The article worries that optimism can be destroyed at any 
moment if the real emphasis was on the NODONG SINMUN commentary 
and the other comment was a harassing tactic noting that no 
changes were seen in North Korea's contact with the United 
States in New York or with the IAEA in Vienna. 
  The article reports the ROK and U.S. Governments are 
establishing phased countermeasures while analyzing North 
Korea's real intent.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday [11 March] brushed aside speculation that 
Japan will arm itself with nuclear weapons, a Foreign Ministry 
official said. 
  "We wish to contribute to peace and security in the 
(Northeast Asian) region while maintaining the set-up under the 
Japan-U.S. security arrangements," the official quoted Hosokawa 
as saying in an interview with the Korean Broadcasting System 
(KBS). 
  "It is impossible for us to go nuclear in light of the 
nuclear allergy of our people," he reportedly said, explaining 
Tokyo's strictly defensive national security policy under its 
war-renouncing Constitution. 
  The interview, held at Hosokawa's official residence, will 
be 
broadcast on the evening of March 22 in a prime-time special KBS 
program on the premier ahead of South Korean President Kim Yong- 
sam's visit to Japan from March 24 through 26. 
  Hosokawa, who visited South Korea for a summit with Kim last 
November, voiced hope the two leaders will reaffirm the need for 
future-oriented Tokyo-Seoul ties, the official said. 
  Expressing deep concern about North Korea's suspected 
nuclear 
weapons development program, the premier called for cooperation 
among Japan, South Korea and the United States in resolving the 
issue, the official said. 
  On bilateral economic relations, Hosokawa noted that the 
transfer of high technology from Japan to South Korea and the 
bilateral trade imbalance in favor of Japan will be brought up 
in discussion of a soon-to-be-created intergovernmental forum 
for new economic partnership, the official said. 
  Hosokawa was also quoted as saying both Japan and the U.S. 
should "take cool and sensible steps" to resolve their brewing 
trade spat, the official said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Kutakhov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo February 17 TASS -- Japan is quite capable of 
building its own nuclear bomb, like any other country with 
similar potential and nuclear power engineering industry, but 
Russian scientists are not apprehensive, according to Professor 
Viktor Murogov, director of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry's 
Institute of Physics and Energy. Professor Murogov was speaking 
upon return from Tokyo, where he attended an international 
roundtable conference on the use of plutonium. 
  "Tokyo is clearly orientated towards the solution of 
energy-supply problems. More, the country announced that it 
renounced nuclear weapons," the scientist said. 
  Japan's ability to produce nuclear weapons within a brief 
period of time became a subject of speculations after the SUNDAY 
TIMES published at the end of January excerpts from a 
confidential British Government report on the matter. 
  "In the development of its nuclear power engineering Tokyo 
is 
oriented to advanced technologies in the field of plutonium and 
the development of reactors of fast neutrons, although the 
Japanese do not yet have such reactors," Murogov said. 
  He said Japan is lagging behind Russia in this respect and 
added that the lag amounted to some 10 years. "Japan buys 
technologies we developed earlier, which brings us good returns 
in hard currency". 
  Murogov said no brain drain has been reported from Russia to 
Japan, although Russian nuclear specialists regularly visit 
Japan, as they do the United States and Western Europe.

  [Text] It was confirmed on 11 March that North Korea is 
developing two new types of long-distance ground-to-ground 
missiles with a longer range than Nodong-1 (whose range is 1,000 
km). 
  Regarding foreign papers' recent reports that North Korea is 
developing new types of missiles with a range of either 2,000 km 
or 3,500 km (tentatively named Taepodong 1 and 2), a government 
intelligence source said: The contents of the reports are 
generally true. U.S. intelligence authorities notified ROK 
authorities early this year about this development. 
Intelligence authorities of the two countries have thereby been 
keeping careful watch.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, Feb 14 (AFP) -- North Korea possesses 
nuclear weapons, a senior Russian national defence institute 
official said Monday [14 February]. 
  Vladimir Kumachev, of Russia's Institute of National 
Security 
and Strategic Research, told AFP that "according to information 
we have received, North Korea has nuclear warheads." 
  Pyongyang also had launch vehicles "which had been perfected 
by the North Koreans themselves to give a longer range" to their 
missiles, added Kumachev, who is an adviser to the director of 
the institute, which was set up in 1991 with the backing of the 
defence and foreign ministries. 
  "We know they have carried out tests in certain African 
countries under totalitarian regimes," he said. 
  Kumachev said the then Soviet Union learned as early as 1985 
that North Korea was starting to develop nuclear weapons, 
prompting Moscow to recall most of its specialists stationed in 
the country. 
  Kumachev added: "We established that the Koreans were 
enriching their uranium more than was necessary for non-military 
purposes, and we learned that secret underground bases had been 
set up in the mountains." 
  At the end of the 1970's the Soviet Union sent about 10 
conventional missiles to North Korea "to protect its frontiers 
with South Korea," while further missile deliveries were made 
via third countries, including Iraq, he said. 
  "We still retain around 15 experts in North Korea to keep us 
up to date with and to monitor its nuclear programme," Kumachev 
said, adding that all now worked exclusively in the civil 
nuclear industry sector. 
  "Our specialists obviously do not have access to all the 
essential information, but they file regular reports on their 
activities to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." 
  Kumachev's comments followed a report earlier Monday by 
Japan's JIJI PRESS that Pyongyang has developed a nuclear bomb 
with the help of Russian nuclear experts. 
  Russian researchers told JIJI that the former Soviet Union 
was engaged in a joint plan with North Korea to build a nuclear 
bomb until 1985, and that Russian scientists continued to 
provide clandestine assistance to Pyongyang. 
  If confirmed, the reports would provide the first proof that 
North Korea has nuclear weapons. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 19 (YONHAP) -- China has recently 
disclosed that North Korea may already possess one or more 
nuclear bombs, the JIJI news agency reported in a dispatch from 
Washington on Saturday. Beijing has in the past opposed 
Pyongyang's acquisition of nuclear arms. 
  Quoting a U.S. military source, JIJI said the United States 
had on many occasions contacted China, a staunch ally of North 
Korea, to determine whether Pyongyang possessed nuclear weapons. 
The answer from China had always been negative on such a 
possibility, the report said. 
  JIJI said the American source based his view on North 
Korea's 
arsenal on information obtained from China in the recent past. 
When a U.S. War College delegation called at the Chinese defense 
college during a visit to Beijing last January, Chinese 
officials said, "North Korea may already possess nuclear arms," 
JIJI quoted the source as saying. 
  The report said the U.S. source believes that China now 
virtually recognizes that North Korea has nuclear weapons based 
on tips from Pyongyang officials during military exchanges 
between the two allies. The source added that there is no way to 
know how many nuclear bombs North Korea may now have, but the 
number could be one or two, according to the JIJI report.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 14 
February in connection with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's 
current visit to the United States to tune the ROK-U.S. policy 
on the nuclear issue. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean carries on page 5 
a 
1,600-world article by Washington-based correspondent Yang 
Sung-hyon summing up Foreign Minister Han's visit to the United 
States. 
  Recalling that North Korea begins to show signs of change 
through its 12 February Foreign Ministry statement while Foreign 
Minister Han's U.S. visit was close to an end, the article 
analyzes that Foreign Minister Han attempted to deliver three 
different messages to North Korea through his U.S. visit. 
  The article says the first message is "the invariable 
efforts 
to settle the nuclear matter through dialogue." The article 
notes that the ROK and the United States, through in-depth 
discussions, were able to tug out an agreement to "open a 
dialogue channel to the last moment for the solution of nuclear 
problem." 
  The second message, the article maintains, is connected with 
"the reports on a crisis on the Korean peninsula and the United 
States preparing stern measures against North Korea." The 
article interprets Han's expression of mild gestures as a move 
to avoid the current situation on the Korean peninsula being 
termed as a crisis. Citing the ROK-U.S. agreement that if the 
North Korean issue was referred to the Security Council, U.N. 
action against Pyongyang should be taken in stages rather than 
through immediate sanctions, the article says Han made clear 
that "the ROK and the United States have no intention of driving 
North Korea to an extreme situation." 
  The third message, the article notes, is "an expression of 
firm will to use a stick if North Korea continues to hold out to 
the end." The article says that the ROK and U.S. Governments 
try to deliver a warning to North Korea that unless North Korea 
accepts inspections by the end of February, sanctions by the 
international community against North Korea will be "out of our 
hands." 
  The article sees that North Korea reacted to Han's such 
messages through its 12 February Foreign Ministry statement and 
concludes that "in this perspective, Han's visit can be 
evaluated as successful." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,400-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Pyong-chin on 
Foreign Minister Han's achievements during his U.S. visit. 
  Citing press reports focusing on possible military scenarios 
in case of war on the Korean peninsula, the article says Han, in 
connection with this, has calmed down the U.S. media's 
aggravated reports by pointing out detailed points. 
  The article continues that "the purpose of Han's U.S. visit 
is to narrow the differences in opinions for the solution of the 
nuclear problem and to make correct diagnosis of the reports on 
a crisis on the Korean peninsula by going into the epicenter of 
the reports." 
  The article then adds that "President Kim's personal letter 
to President Clinton also firmly reaffirmed ROK-U.S. cooperation 
over the nuclear issue and expressed "concern and 
unpleasantness" over the U.S. media's reports on a crisis on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The article concludes by saying that Han reassured the U.S. 
media that the current military movements on the Korean 
peninsula -- including the recent reports on concentration of 
North Korean troops near the DMZ, deployment of the Patriot 
missiles, and resumption of Team Spirit exercise -- are not 
something new aimed at preparing steps to countermeasure a 
possible crisis.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Tues -- Defense Minister Datuk Sri 
Najib Tun Razak says there is a need to boost the capabilities 
of the armed forces to ensure political stability and economic 
development. 
  He said today the government had set aside funds to 
modernise 
the armed forces to deter any prospective aggressor. 
  "With the armed forces' improved capabilities, an aggressor 
will think twice about testing our defence," he added. 
  Najib said this when interviewed on the TV3's inaugural 
Malaysia Hari Ini [Malaysia Today] morning talk show. 
  He also said the government was reviewing the national 
defense policy to keep it in line with the changes and 
challenges facing the armed forces. 
  He said the higher defense spending should not be seen as an 
attempt by Malaysia to join the arms race. 
  However, this was to keep up with developments in defense 
technology to ensure the armed forces had modern equipment and 
for continuous economic development. 
  During the special programme, Najib also answered public 
enquiries and suggestions through the toll-free telephone lines. 
  To a caller's question, Najib said the armed forces did not 
plan to include nuclear arms as part of its modernization 
programme. 
  There was no need for such weapons in the region since the 
end of the Cold War had removed superpower rivalry in the 
region, he explained. 
  To another question, Najib said Malaysian troops were safe 
in 
Bosnia despite the Serb forces' recent threat to retaliate 
against the air strike threat by NATO. 
  NATO had threatened to carry out air strikes if the Serb 
forces did not pull back their heavy guns from the hills around 
Sarajevo.

  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Three men were arrested in this 
Thai-Cambodian border district yesterday for allegedly smuggling 
dangerous goods, suspected to be uranium, into the country. 
  A combined unit of police and military officers arrested 
Narong Foitakhu, 48, Thawon Plangkamon, 46, and Khian Phongsi, 
60, near a market in Ban Khlong Luk and seized a tin box 
suspected to contain the radioactive substance. 
  The rusty box, which is 28 cms long, 21 cms wide, and 6 cms 
tall, and weighing about 4.2 kgs, is imprinted with a danger 
sign and a phrase in English which reads: "1974-1994 Uranium 
999X Made in USA 2350827." 
  The police said they have not yet opened the box as they 
fear 
that the contents inside might be dangerous. The box would be 
sent to either the Mineral Resources Department or the Army's 
Chemical Department for inspection. 
  According to the police, the suspects confessed that they 
were hired to bring the box from Cambodia to a customer in 
Bangkok. The suspects reportedly said that Cambodian people 
told them the substance inside the box was a mineral that could 
"eat iron" since nails or metal scrap placed on the box 
decomposed very quickly. 
  The three have been charged with violating the Customs Act 
by 
importing and possessing prohibited articles.

  [Text] The Burapha Special Task Force has urged the Army's 
Scientific Department to immediately identify the substance 
contained in a tin box seized by a combined unit of police and 
military officers from three men last week. 
  The deputy commander of the Aranyaprathet task force unit, 
Col. Itsara Watcharaprathip, said senior Army officers in 
Bangkok showed high interest in the box suspected to contain 
uranium. 
  The rusty box, which is 28 cms long, 21 cms wide and 6 cms 
deep and weighs about 4.2 kgs, bears a danger sign and a phrase 
in English which reads "1974-1994 Uranum 999x Made in USA 
2350827". 
  Col. Itsara said he received an order from his superior to 
closely monitor the reported smuggling dangerous goods, 
suspected to be radioactive substances, and to try to prevent 
them entering the country. 
  He said he had an intelligence report that at least 10 
similar boxes weighing from one to five kgs were smuggled into 
Thailand and were sold to junk dealers for 200,000 to 1,000,000 
baht.

  [Text] The head of the atomic energy authority issued a 
press release yesterday urging the public not to be alarmed over 
recent cases involving radioactive material. 
  Suchat Mongkhonphan, secretary-general of the Office of 
Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), said the quantities and types of 
uranium involved meant they were not dangerous to public health. 
  But the release also suggests that the eight barrels of 
hazardous waste imported last year by a Thai company may have 
contained small quantities of the uranium isotope -- Uranium-235 
-- considered most dangerous. 
  It was revealed last week that Thai Tantalum Co Ltd had 
imported from the United States nearly 3,000 kgs of toxic sludge 
contaminated by radioactivity. Officials from the Department of 
Industrial Works later announced that the company's import 
licence would be revoked. 
  Last June, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission had sent a 
letter to Suchat's office via the Thai Embassy in Washington 
warning that the waste contained radioactive substances. But 
the OAEP has not been able to locate any records acknowledging 
the letter's receipt. 
  Thai Tantalum claimed that tests run on the sludge showed 
with a 90 percent certainty that it contains less than 0.2 
percent (or roughly 5.5 kgs) of thorium and uranium, two highly 
radioactive substances. 
  "The company has donated the sludge to the OAEP and we now 
have it in possession," Suchat announced. 
  "There is uranium contamination, but very little in quantity 
and most of it is Uranium-238. 
  "The level of radioactivity is not considered dangerous for 
anyone. Its concentration is below the standard set by the 
Atomic Energy for Peace Act of 1960." 
  The press release did not mention the exact amount of 
radioactive material in the sludge. According to an amendment 
to the law, those importing material containing 15 percent or 
more of uranium or thorium must obtain a licence from the Atomic 
Energy Commission. 
  The press release explained that 99.28 percent of uranium 
found in nature is Uranium-238. Uranium-235, which makes up 
only 0.71 percent of the isotopes found naturally, is the type 
that is used in nuclear reactors and to make bombs. The other 
uranium isotope found in nature is Uranium-234, it said. 
  It had not previously been known that isotopes other than 
Uranium-238 were present in the sludge. 
  "The office will use the material for research," the report 
explained. 
  Suchat also asserted that the uranium boxes reportedly being 
smuggled into Thailand from Cambodia are not dangerous. 
  "From our experience -- we have come across this kind of box 
twice before -- we have found they contain depleted uranium 
[Uranium-238] and have very low radioactivity," Suchat 
maintained. 
  He also explained that when Uranium-235 (or enriched 
uranium) 
is extracted for use from natural uranium, the remainder is 
called depleted uranium. It is considered very cheap, he said.

  [Text] Government officials announced yesterday that they 
will revoke the import licence granted to a firrn which has 
brought in nearly 3,000 kg of hazardous waste contaminated by 
radioactivity from the US. 
  The amount of radioactivity released by the materials 
already 
imported has not actually been measured but both company and 
state officials believe the concentrations of radioactive 
elements are so low as to pose no danger to public health. 
  However, for safety's sake, the materials will reportedly be 
transported to Bangkok today to be used by the Office of Atomic 
Energy for Peace (OAEP). 
  Thai Tantalum Co Ltd imported the waste last year as raw 
material for the extraction of tantalum pentoxide and columbium 
pentoxide -- used to make electronic capacitors -- at its 
factory in the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate. 
  But company president Yut Eamsa-at said it was only a "free 
sample" and had not been used because it was low-grade. He 
agreed yesterday not to import any more of the substance. 
  Officials from the Department of Industrial Works' Office of 
Hazardous Substances (OHS) were informed about the shipment and 
issued Thai Tantalum an import licence. But they were not told 
that it contained radioactive substances, or that it came from a 
hazardous waste site. 
  "We believe Thai Tantalum was just looking for cheap raw 
materials and they are not interested in importing any more of 
the waste," OHS Director Virah Mavichak said yesterday. "The 
amount of radioactivity is believed to be low, but we are 
unhappy that it came from a waste site. So we will revoke the 
import licence." 
  According to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 
documents, the shipment originated from a hazardous waste site 
in Muskogee, Oklahoma which contains roughly 21 tonnes of 
thorium and nine tonnes of uranium, both highly radioactive 
substances. The waste site belongs to Fansteel Inc, a former 
producer of tantalum and columbium products which now supplies 
Thai Tantalum with technical expertise. 
  Thai Tantalum officials yesterday could not say for sure how 
much radioactive matenal was in the waste brought into Thailand. 
According to Jim Hill, a former employee of Fansteel now working 
as Thai Tantalum's lab manager, the thorium and uranium were 
unevenly distributed through Fansteel's sludge ponds, which were 
"the size of a football field" and contained 13.4 million kg of 
mostly solid waste. 
  An X-ray analysis of the imported materials carried out by 
Hill revealed with "90 percent certainty" that uranium and 
thorium made up less than 0.2 percent of the sludge, or 5.5 kg. 
He said some of the standards needed to carry out the analysis 
were lacking. 
  However, Thai Tantalum has never actually measured the 
radioactivity of the imported materials, or of the estimated 60 
kg of radioactive materials it puts in its state-of-the-art 
landfill every day, because it does not have a geiger counter. 
  But Yut sought to assure the public that the low 
concentrations of radioactive material, combined with the 
factory's hi-tech waste treatment system, meant that the area 
was safe. The company's former plant in Phuket was burned to 
the ground in 1986 by protestors afraid of being exposed to 
radioactivity.

  [Text] The Brazilian Government is willing to comply with 
the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) guidelines. In an 
official document, the government admitted that the 
implementation of the MTCR guidelines does not imply any sort of 
limitation on special national programs or harm international 
cooperation in such programs. In addition, the government 
commits itself to complying with export control rules compatible 
with the MTCR guidelines as soon as draft bill No. 2535/92 takes 
effect. 
  This decision, which was announced 11 February, befits the 
efforts made by the Brazilian Government in the last few weeks 
to show the international community that the country is 
contributing to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and that its nuclear and aerospace programs have 
strictly peaceful objectives. Thus, the government believes it 
has taken one more step toward obtaining sensitive technology.

<F P=106> [Article by Senator Dirceu Carneiro, Brazilian Social </F>
Democracy Party-Santa Catarina State, who coordinated the 
nuclear safeguards bill and is the Budget Committee's second 
vice president] 
  [Text] The executive branch's position regarding nuclear 
safeguards has been causing controversy in the national media, 
which has been unable, so far, to supply society with useful and 
clarifying information on the issue. The nuclear safeguards are 
being examined by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, but it 
is a complex matter and demands that the Foreign Ministry hold 
exhaustive negotiations at the international level. 
  The consequences of signing this sort of treaty are, 
theoretically, permanent in the history of a country. Before 
signing it, therefore, society must meditate and debate the 
issue and the government must disseminate information on it. In 
such cases, the legislative branch digests all the information 
and assigns to it the period of political and social time 
required to allow all areas of society to give their opinion on 
the issue. It is legitimate that the legislative branch does so: 
It is its right and duty. 
  Brazil did not sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(TNP), and will not do it in the future either, considering it 
discriminatory and unfair. The Brazilian Constitution, however, 
forbids the construction of atomic bombs, and I believe Brazil 
is the only country to have done so. Nonetheless, the 
international community conveniently included Brazil in the 
group of countries that did not sign the TNP because they do not 
have the bomb, side by side with India, Pakistan, and Israel. It 
thus punished the country and made it difficult for us to have 
access to sensitive technologies. 
  To overcome this discrimination, Brazil and Argentina 
created 
the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control 
(ABACC), which is a regional agency similar to the EC's Euraton. 
The establishment of ABACC and the signature of the 
Quadripartite Accord by Brazil, Argentina, ABACC, and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reduced foreign 
pressure on Brazil and allowed it to join the international 
community. 
  To comply with these agreements, we must offer guarantees to 
the safeguards but we also can prevent foreign organizations, 
which comprise more than 85 countries and have differing 
interests, from using the "special surveys" argument and harming 
our country. These agreements may be used as tools to exert 
political pressure over matters absolutely unrelated to nuclear 
energy. This is what we want to prevent by better analyzing the 
text of the safeguards agreement. 
  So far, we have corrected certain vague parts of the text of 
the Supplement Adjustments to the Quadripartite Accord on 
control of nuclear energy use. All the Senate has to do now is 
approve the agreement, and it probably will do it without 
difficulties. 
  Anyway, the world already expected Brazil to adopt the 
safeguards. This is why I deem absurd the news reported by the 
press, which I believe to be fake news proposed by a lobby 
[preceding word in English], that Germany plans to break the 
nuclear agreement signed with Brazil and oppose our 
participation in the UN Security Council, unless we approve the 
Quadripartite Accord and the Tlatelolco Treaty. 
  Our agreement with the Germans, which is independent, 
already 
contemplates safeguards with Germany. The Germans have no 
relation whatsoever with the Tlatelolco Treaty, which is a 
regional agreement. The Quadripartite Accord, however, is a 
claim by the entire developed world that, through the news of an 
alleged threat by the Germans, seems to be interested in 
exerting pressure on Brazil to transform it into a captive 
market. 
  Nowadays, there is a basic problem that must be solved 
before 
the safeguards are voted on. Otherwise, we may take from Brazil 
its right to sovereignty. We must eliminate an amendment to the 
Tlatelolco Treaty that forbids the construction and use of 
atomic weapons in Latin America because it clashes with one of 
the objectives Brazil sought to maintain in the text of the 
Quadripartite Accord, i.e., the prohibition on conducting 
special surveys based on charges made in the national territory. 
The amendment that must be eliminated allows this sort of survey. 
  Through this amendment, the IAEA experts could come to 
Brazil 
to survey any facility, reported or not to IAEA, and take 
possession of industrial information that could be used to stop 
our development. Learning about progress in a specific research 
project, the developed countries could harm Brazil by failing to 
transfer technology to us that would allow us to advance in that 
research and begin manufacturing the same products they do. As a 
result of commercial interests and other sorts of interests, 
these countries would struggle to maintain international 
preservation of their products. 
  These concerns, which are known to all Brazilians, have been 
guiding the Brazilian Foreign Affairs Committee's analysis of 
the issue. 
  The first positive result of this position was Brazil's 
obtaining the approval of the Supplemental Adjustments even 
before ratification of the quadripartite agreement. This gave 
acknowledged, obvious benefits to Brazil. 
  Other results were the formal statements by the IAEA and the 
Organization to Ban Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (OPANAL), 
confirming that the supplemental adjustments of the 
quadripartite agreement apply to the Tlatelolco Treaty. The text 
of the Tlatelolco Treaty, unlike that of the quadripartite 
agreement, permits inspections in any country under suspicion. 
After the Persian Gulf war, this instrument became a dangerous 
tool used by the IAEA, especially for inspections prompted by 
the pressing of charges, a method that is unacceptable to Brazil. 
  The responsibility of Congress is to obtain the best for 
Brazil. Despite the desires of some government officials, who 
are efficiently lobbying through the press, we will not 
deliberate before the matter is fully clarified. Ratifying the 
treaty -- which has already been signed -- one week earlier or 
one week later will make no difference. Consequently, the 
Brazilian position has been clearly outlined to the 
international community; it is a fact. Within this context, 
ratifying and adjusting are mere details.

<F P=106> [Article written by Jayme Brener with the cooperation of </F>
Helio Contreiras in Rio de Janeiro and Otto Sarkis in Brasilia: 
"Dr. Von Braun's Return"] 
  [Text] H.O.P. are three letters that stand for pure 
dynamite. They are the initials of Lieutenant Brigadier Hugo de 
Oliveira Piva, the father of the Brazilian space program and of 
half a dozen domestic missile projects. His name stirred a 
great deal of controversy in the 1980's when he went to work for 
Iraq's Saddam Husayn with Brasilia's concurrence, although such 
concurrence was never fully assumed. Well, the man behind 
these three letters is back. At 67, and retired since 1987, 
Piva is quietly serving as an informal adviser -- although 
without pay -- for two of his old projects, which were 
resuscitated in recent months through new doses of government 
funds. These projects are the MAA-1 Piranha (an air-to-air 
missile) and the MSS 1.2 (surface-to-surface missile). 
  Piva knows that his name, or just his initials, has been at 
the center of one of the worst controversies in the history of 
Brazilian-U.S. relations. The fact is that Uncle Sam has never 
forgiven him for his cooperation with Saddam Husayn, who was 
thrashed in 1991 during the Gulf war on an initiative of the 
White House. To avoid further friction, "the brigadier" -- 
Piva's nickname -- has not put his signature on any of these 
projects and, officially, he continues to work as an 
international dealer of a large number of products ranging from 
black pepper to machine tools. This is a rather sad job for 
someone having two doctorate degrees -- in aeronautics and 
applied mathematics -- from foreign universities and who had 
become known as "Brazil's Dr. Von Braun," in reference to German 
scientist Wernher von Braun, the pioneer of aerospace research 
in the United States. Yet, Piva's dream is to be able to come 
back through the front door to the field of arms manufacturing 
or to the Brazilian aerospace program. Speaking to ISTOE, he 
said that he might be able to do that during the next government 
"if it is favorable to resuming the materiel, aeronautics, and 
nuclear industries given their role in promoting development and 
national sovereignty." 
  Piva said: "I view the resumption of Brazilian missile 
projects with satisfaction and reassurance because these 
projects will promote advanced technology -- which is essential 
for the progress of any nation -- in every area." He added: 
"After all, I regard these projects as my children whom I used 
to hold on my lap." To a certain extent, he still holds them. 
The Aeronautics Ministry has entrusted the development of the 
Piranha project -- under an $8.8 million contract -- to the 
Mectron Engineering Company, which is based in Sao Jose dos 
Campos [Sao Paulo State], without a prior bidding process in 
light of its being highly specialized in the field. Working 
for Mectron are Piva's "scientific children," that is, a 
handful of researchers who worked with him after graduating from 
the tough Aeronautical Technology Institute (ITA) and 
participated in the early stages of the Piranha project. They 
followed the brigadier to two missile factories: Orbita, a 
mixed company, and Avibras [Avibras Aerospace Industry, Inc.] a 
private company. Then, in 1989, they left for Iraq. Their 
mission was to develop an air-to-air missile. Those who turned 
to the dictionary to look up the word for piranha in Arabic -- 
if there is one -- made the right move. They all had a 
humiliating return to Brazil as the Brazilian Government was 
aligned with the anti-Saddam alliance and denied any 
responsibility concerning the work of the scientists. Piva said: 
"The Collor de Mello government was dominated by foreign 
interests and needed a scapegoat." 
  Following the Iraqi affair, the leading members of the team 
of researchers created Mectron while Piva announced his 
retirement. In 1992, Mectron obtained a contract with the Army 
to complete the MSS 1.2 surface-to-surface missile, which is now 
being tested. Piva helped them secretly. Now, Mectron -- which 
has a little more than 30 employees -- is grabbing a slice of 
the Piranha project. Mectron Technical Director Renato Zanetta 
declines to comment on his ties with his mentor. According to 
Major Brigadier Nelson Taveira, director of the Aerospace 
Technical Center (CTA), "Piva has nothing to do with this 
project." Yet, the man whose initials are H.O.P. has given 
Mectron -- in addition to his expert advice -- papers, sketches, 
and diagrams of the Iraqi Al-Piranha. All this was done 
secretly because Hugo de Oliveira Piva, a retired lieutenant 
brigadier earning the equivalent of $1,400 monthly, continues to 
quietly run his company Spaceplus from an office located above a 
lingerie store in downtown Sao Jose. 
  The award of contracts to Mectron, a company that is very 
close to Piva's heart, would then be a well-earned 
acknowledgement of the work of somebody who has been racking his 
brain to produce missiles, wouldn't it? This is what the 
majority of the military involved in the project believe. But 
insiders in the military hardware industry, who are already 
"hot-tempered" by nature, are even more troubled. The sharpest 
thrusts come from Avibras, at present the only manufacturer of 
rockets in the country, also located in Sao Jose. Avibras Vice 
President Rubens Porto contends that "our advice has not been 
sought for the development of the Piranha missile, but if we 
were consulted we would have alternative projects." Major 
Brigadier Jose Marcone, deputy chairman of the Brazilian 
Commission of Space Activities, adds that "Avibras was not 
interested in the Piranha." An engineer satirizes: "The truth 
is that Avibras was never able to recover from the killing off 
of scientists made by Piva there." 
  Piva and Avibras have not been on speaking terms for a long 
time. In 1991, when the company entered into composition with 
its creditors, Piva was hired by a bank to make an estimation of 
the equipment offered by the company as collateral for the 
payment of its debts. When Piva went to the Avibras' 
facilities, which have very strict security control, he 
presented himself as "engineer Hugo de Oliveira." When Avibras 
managers saw their rival on the premises they got the fright of 
their life. From there to pressing charges of industrial 
espionage there was only one step. 
  Piva smiles when talking about this incident. His smile 
vanishes when he recalls that in spite of being the father of 
the renaissance in the Brazilian missile industry, the latter is 
far from being the apple of his eye. His real pet answers to 
the name of V.L.S., satellite launching vehicle, a project that 
goes back to the 1970's but that was hamstrung by lack of funds. 
Last year, however, the project was revived because the 
government promised to invest $40 million in the sector in the 
next three years. It is estimated that the V.L.S. will be 
launched in 1995 carrying a satellite that will also be of 
Brazilian make. 
  The only thing is that the acronym V.L.S. -- as well as the 
initials H.O.P. -- is tantamount to having problems with the 
United States because Brazil is not a signatory to the 
international treaty on the control of missile production. The 
Brazilian Government guarantees that the V.L.S. project -- which 
is being developed by the newly set up Bahia Space Agency since 
the end of January -- is a purely civilian endeavor -- green and 
yellow [the colors of the Brazilian flag] and not olive green. 
Notwithstanding this, the White House mistrusts Brazil given 
the fact that whoever has the know-how for launching satellites 
may very well launch a military missile having a range of 1,000 
km. The United States is also suspicious of all the other 
countries that have refused to sign the aforementioned treaty, 
namely India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Iraq itself. U.S. 
military have gone as far as hinting that Piva may have used the 
V.L.S. technology to upgrade Iraq's Scud missiles. By using its 
clout, the U.S. Government did its utmost to delay the Brazilian 
aerospace project. Its last bid for delaying it was to ban 
Brazil from having access to inertial platforms, the devices 
that guide the rocket. Piva and Brigadier Taveira from the CTA 
argue that the problem has already been overcome. A CTA 
official notes, in a state of euphoria that "we have even 
managed to buy a computer for the rocket from the United 
Kingdom, a faithful ally of the United States." "We thought 
that they were not going to deliver it," he added. The most 
skeptical ones, however, contend that the satellite launcher 
still has many shortcomings and that the frequently claimed 
self-sufficiency is all but designed to lure possible suppliers 
of the necessary equipment. 
  If the Brazilian aerospace program is already facing 
difficulties, one can very well imagine how it fared after 
Piva's signature. Even though he has many friends and disciples 
at the CTA of Sao Jose dos Campos, Piva tries to avoid even 
coming close to the center. As a friend of his notes, "his face 
shines when he talks about the V.L.S.." As soon as he starts 
working on exportation and importation, Piva's thoughts wander 
to what is in store for him. He does not rule out the 
possibility of wearing a researcher's overall. H.O.P. says he 
does not support any candidacy in particular, but concedes that 
"Lula's [Luis Inacio da Silva] PT [Workers Party] has supported 
the development of the military hardware industry, which is 
precisely what I have always defended." In conclusion, he says: 
"I could go back to that area if I were asked to do so by a 
government that follows those guidelines, whether it represented 
the PT or any other party."

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Feb (MENA) -- An Arab League committee 
discussing means of turning the Middle East to an area free from 
weapons of mass destruction began its meetings at the Arab 
League today. 
  Dr. Nu'man Jalal, chairman of the committee and Egypt's 
permanent delegate to the Arab League, said that the committee 
has prepared a paper that it will present to the next session of 
the Arab League Council, due to be held on 27 March. The paper 
contains a plan to coordinate Arab efforts through various 
international forums with a view to stressing the importance of 
creating a zone that is free from mass destruction weapons in 
the Middle East. 
  Dr. Jalal said that the plan incorporates various elements 
in 
the Arab position, foremost of which is the desire to end the 
arms race in the region and its security and economic 
repercussions. Resources currently used to stockpile arms should 
be diverted to boost economic development programs and modernize 
the region's economies, Dr. Jalal stated. 
  Dr. Jalal added that the committee stressed the need for all 
the countries in the region to be treated equally, with no 
exceptions made for any.

<F P=106> [Article by Kamlendra Kanwar] </F>
  [Text] Bombay -- Former Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] 
chairman Homi N. Sethna has described a "absolute hogwash" 
recent reports that Pakistan has acquired nuclear weapon 
capability and that the Indian sub-continent was "a 
screwdriver's turn" away from a nuclear holocaust twice in the 
last seven years. 
  In an interview with INDIAN EXPRESS Sethna who was AEC chief 
from 1972 to 1983 during which time the country exploded an 
experimental nuclear device at Pokhran in Rajasthan said 
contrary to Pakistan's claims, it had not been able to achieve 
more than 60 per cent uranium enrichment with the centrefuge 
technology that it had acquired. 
  The enrichment required for gas to be converted into 
bombgrade heavy metal was at least 90 per cent, he pointed out. 
  Besides, it had never seriously taken the plutonium path 
whereas India had started reprocessing plutonium way back in 
1967-68. 
  Sethna said the Americans were given to exaggeration and it 
suited Pakistan to be seen as a burgeoning nuclear power in the 
region for domestic political reasons. 
  While contending that India was way ahead of Pakistan in the 
nuclear field he denied that it ever had aggressive intentions. 
Reacting to the reported claim by an American journalist William 
E. Burrows in his book Critical Mass that Indira Gandhi had made 
elaborate plans to bomb Pakistan's Kahuta enrichment plant 
before she was assassinated in 1984 he said this was a blatant 
lie. 
  Being in a vantage position in the AEC and the Government 
there was no way such a plan could have escaped his attention, 
he added. 
  Asked how he felt now about the 1974 Pokhran blast as he 
looked back, Sethna said he was confused as to what purpose was 
served in exploding a device and then not following it up. "We 
should have gone flat out, acquired the status of a nuclear 
power and bargained for a place in the Security Council," he 
said with authority. 
  Reacting to a question on how secure Bombay's nuclear 
installations were from enemy air attacks, Sethna said the Cyrus 
and Dhruva reactors as also the plutonium reprocessing 
facilities were well protected. However, the radio metallurgy 
and radio chemistry labs in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre 
were vulnerable. 
  Queried about the possibility of a nuclear arms race in Asia 
in the wake of North Korea's acquisition of nuclear capability 
he said American attempts to bring the North Koreans to heal 
were in order. 
  However, reports about US plans to supply Scud missiles to 
South Korea were disturbing. 
  The Scuds were proved ineffective during the Gulf War and 
any 
effort to arm South Korea with them would fuel suspicions that 
the US is pandering to its strong arms suppliers lobby.

  [Text] The Defense Research and Development Organization 
has described yesterday's successful test firing of the Agni 
missile as a technology achievement. It said the indigenously 
developed surface-to-surface intermediate-range missile, which 
was launched from Chandipur in Orissa yesterday evening, met all 
the test objectives. A report issued on the flight today said 
the third flight of the Agni validated the innovative indigenous 
design feature aimed at testing the longer range and advanced 
maneuverability during the reentry phase. The flight tested the 
high thermal and structural capability of the vehicle which 
undergoes great stress at the reentry stage while moving at a 
hypersonic speed. The reentry stage takes place at about 30 km 
above the earth surface and the outside of the vehicle gets 
heated to about 3,000 degree Celsius. However, the inside 
temperature of the vehicle is maintained at 40 degree Celsius. 
The Defense Ministry release said that the Agni payload 
performed to the design specifications with great accuracy. It 
was a fiery spectacle as it hit the target. The successful test 
reaffirmed the country's capability in advanced technology.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 26 -- A new dimension has been added 
to the defence and technological capabilities with the induction 
of the Prithvi missile in the country's arsenal. 
  Integrated in the regiment of artillery three months ago, 
the 
missile was for the first time on display at the Republic Day 
parade here. Operational control of the Prithvi will be shared 
by the Army and the Air Force. 
  Developed by the Defence Research and Development 
Organisation (DRDO) in the teeth of Western opposition, this 
achievement is all the more striking. The United States has led 
the campaign against India's missile programme and its 
`concerns' on Indian missilery including the Prithvi were 
clearly stated during the visit to the United States in August 
by the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. 
  With accuracy being one of its key features, the Prithvi can 
strike assigned targets deep inside enemy territory. The 
missile's range is restricted to 150 kms while carrying a 
heavier warhead. But, when the maximum load of one tonne is 
halved, it can strike at 250 km. 
  With the minimum weight of a nuclear warhead estimated at 
500 
kg, India can thus, theoretically, deliver a nuclear strike. But 
with a national decision not to develop nuclear weapons, the 
missile is expected to be used only in a conventional conflict. 
The missile's high accuracy is meant to deliver conventional 
explosives effectively. 
  However, the country is far from obtaining a permanent 
military edge over nations such as Pakistan. Without integrating 
other missile systems (it is now developing the 2,000 km Agni 
IRBM along with the Akash, Trishul, and Nag missiles), India 
will have to contend with a formidable Pakistani missile arsenal. 
  Aided by China and France in the past, Pakistan is actively 
developing its own missile armoury. In the Hatf series of 
Pakistani missiles, the Hatf-2 is nearing completion. When 
deploying a conventional warhead, the missile has the capacity 
of reaching Delhi. Progress on the Hatf-3 adds to India's worry. 
Capable of reaching distances up to 800 km, it can deliver a 
nuclear warhead. Hatf-3 may be in Pakistani arsenals by 1995. 
The transfer of Chinese M-11 missiles to Pakistan reinforces 
India's apprehensions. With a range of 290 km the nuclear 
missile can release a 800 kg warhead. 
  New technology: Developed by the Integrated Guided 
Missile Development Board since 1983, the Prithvi possesses 
important new technologies. The originality of the missile's 
design and packages are evident for there are few similarities 
with other contemporary delivery systems. Its success may help 
to finetune the Agni systems. 
  Aimed at providing strength without making the missile 
heavy, the Prithvi's frame is made from locally developed light 
aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys are used for the wings. 
Light aluminium alloys go into the making of the propellant 
tanks. Once the propellants are filled the tanks can be sealed. 
  With focus initially on testing the reliability and guidance 
of the missile, the first trials began in 1988. An on-board 
computer carries out the task of the Prithvi's guidance and 
flight control. It also checks out sequences before and after 
the launch. Related to accuracy, the missiles guidance was 
continuously tested. 
  But when the missile strayed from its flight path in one of 
the tests, its aerodynamic controls were critically reviewed. 
Later tests were carried out to ensure that the correction was 
made fool-proof. 
  Powered by two rocket motors, the missile's engine also 
assist providing forward, lateral and roll motion to the 
missile. Hydraulic actuators provide the force to the engines 
and tail fins facilitating aerodynamic control. Developed and 
integrated by the Defence Research and Development Laboratory 
(DRDL), the development of the software packages is considered a 
major national achievement. 
  Proving its mobility, some of the later tests saw the 
missile 
being successfully fired from a eight-wheeled truck.

  [Text] New DelhI, Feb. 11 -- The `life-line' of air defence 
is Pechora missile and the No. 7 Base Repair Depot at Tuglaqabad 
keeps the missile system at optimal operational capability by 
carrying out regular maintenance, according to Air Commodore 
P.K. Ghosh, Air Officer Commanding, Tughlaqabad Air Force base. 
  Explaining the working of the base to a group of journalists 
who were taken round the depot here today, he said, "In the 
present geopolitical scenario missiles are of paramount 
importance". 
  The one-ton, six-metre long Pechora missile which is the 
most 
sophisticated is completely stripped to its individual parts 
along with the launcher and the missile guidance radar (MGR) as 
also the instruments in its control cabin. 
  About 750 personnel of the 1,200 at the base work on the 
different parts which are divided into as many as 300 
sub-assemblies each having thousands of parts. 
  The guided missile can look onto the enemy aircraft and 
going 
at the speed of Mach-4 (four times the speed of sound) around 
13200 metre per second destroys enemy aircraft within 11 to 17 
kilometre. 
  The life of the missile is 49 second and if it does not hit 
the target within that time it goes straight up and destroys 
itself. 
  The launchers are so synchronised that the radar and the 
missile simultaneously point towards the direction of the enemy 
aircraft. 
  As the target (hostile aircraft) is tracked by the MGR, the 
missile is automatically pointed towards the target. The entire 
operations being controlled from the control cabin of MGR where 
one can spot the hostile aircraft as a `blip' as soon as it 
comes within the range of the radar. After tracking the 
aircraft the missiles electronically home on to the target. 
  The missile's range is 25 kilometre but generally the hit is 
made at a distance of 11 to 17 kilometre. 
  Once the missile homes on to the target then a kind of 
electronic relationship is established between the missile and 
the target and the movement of the missile continues to be 
guided by that of the aircraft automatically by a command 
guidance system. So the question of the enemy aircraft 
manoeuvring and escaping does not arise, as the missile remains 
continuously latched on to it. 
  The decision to launch the missile is taken by the alert IAF 
[Indian Air Force] officers depending on the combat 
considerations and the `launch' button is pressed when the 
aircraft is well within the kill zone. 
  At a time when the radio signals being received from the 
aircraft by the missile become very high crossing a 
pre-determined threshold (showing the missile is close to the 
target) the missile automatically explodes its warhead which 
consists of metal pieces. 
  The explosion which is caused about 300 metre away from the 
aircraft forms a kind of spherical cloudburst of metalic pieces 
which the aircraft cannot avoid and goes straight into it. 
Being hit by the shrapnels at supersonic speeds the aircraft is 
usually destroyed or severely damaged. 
  The kill probability of hostile aircraft is of the order of 
100 per cent. 
  The MGR has been provided with necessary anti-jamming 
protection to effectively function even when jammed. 
  Two generators supply the power to the missile system so 
that 
if one fails the system can function without disruption. 
  The radar also has a television camera which can visually 
track the aircraft even at distance of 25 kilometre and supply 
visual data on a television screen inside the MGR so that if for 
some reason the radars don't give the signals automatically then 
manually trackers can track the aircraft with the visual input 
and fire the missile. 
  First and second line maintenance is carried out by the 
Squadron in the field and the third and fourth line repair 
(medium repair) as well as defect repairs beyond the squadrons 
capabilities are carried out here. 
  On induction equipment is stripped, examined by specialist 
tradesmen at the production wings under close supervision of 
specialist officers and quality assurance inspectors to access 
the quantum of deterioration and the quantum of work spares 
required to carry out the medium repair as per schedule of 
repair technology prepared by the manufacturers. The logistics 
support wing caters for the timely provisions of the 
spares/materials to undertake repairs by production shops. 
  The components of stripped down equipment pass through a 
series of medium repair operation, which include cleaning, 
washing, painting, cabin repairs, repair of electrical and 
electronic components, replacement of mandatory items and 
defective components, assembly of panel and checks against 
standard equipment (Stand Tuning), assembly of main equipment, 
functional test for serviceability, and endurance test for 
reliability of the equipment. 
  On completion of all the operations, all self-systems of the 
Pechora Missile System is connected together and comprehensive 
test of the system as a whole is carried out. On successful 
completion of this comprehensive test, Directorate of Air Staff 
Inspection carry out a thorough functional check of the complete 
Missile System as it would be deployed and used in a Squadron 
and it declares it fit to operational use. 
  As the missile is of Soviet origin, efforts are also being 
made to procure spares of Indian origin.

  [Text] Bangalore, Jan 27 (UNI) -- The chairman of the 
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Prof U.R. Rao, said 
on Thursday that Russia had expressed its inability to go ahead 
with the transfer of technology on the controversial cryogenic 
rocket engines. 
  Talking to newsmen at the inauguration of a private company 
set up for manufacturing hybrid micro devices which could find 
application in the realm of space, Prof Rao said discussions 
were on between the Russian Space Agency, Glavkosmos, and the 
ISRO on the cryogenic engines deal, and that something had to be 
evolved to the satisfaction of all. Asked if he was satisfied 
with the discussions, Prof Rao said if he was happy, he would 
have said so. 
  The ISRO chief said efforts were on to build the cryogenic 
engines indigenously and added that he was confident that the 
Indian engines would be ready by 1998. 
  ISRO had already built a one tonne sub-scale cryogenic 
engine 
at its Mahendragiri facility. 
  Facilities for testing the cryogenic engines were being 
readied, he added. 
  Prof. Rao said ISRO would not pay a rupee more than Rs 235 
crore to Glavkosmos for the cryogenic engine deal, whatever may 
be the outcome of discussions now underway. Nothing will stop us 
from building our own facilities, he asserted. 
  Prof Rao said ISRO had not approached the General Dynamics 
Inc. (of the United States), the Arianespace or the Glavkosmos 
for the knowhow on cryogenic engines. These organisations had 
contacted the ISRO and the Russian offer was accepted when the 
Arianespace bid was about to be placed before the Union Cabinet. 
  He said the technology embargo slapped by the United States 
on the ISRO (for alleged violation of the Missile Technology 
Control Regime) was nothing new, for such "unpronounced 
embargos" existed much before the cryo-deal was struck with 
Russia.

  [Text] Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 6 -- Amid reports that 
Russia has offered India two additional cryogenic stages, but 
not the technology, for its next generation Geostationary 
Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), there are questions about how 
far such a renegotiated contract would benefit India. 
  The Rs. 235-crore contract signed by the Indian Space 
Research Organisation with Glavkosmos of Russia in January 1991 
had been for the supply of two cryogenic stages and transfer of 
technology. The United States objected to the deal, insisting 
that it violated the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), 
and in May 1992 imposed a two-year embargo on the ISRO and 
Glavkosmos. Under the U.S. pressure, Russia invoked the force 
majeure clause and informed the Government of India in July last 
year that Glavkosmos would not transfer cryogenic technology or 
production equipment. 
  In a press interview at the time, the ISRO Chairman, Prof 
U.R. Rao, had asserted that India was not interested in mere 
engines. The sale of engines without the accompanying transfer 
of technology was meaningless, he said. When a Glavkosmos team, 
led by its head, Mr. Alexander Dunayev, was in Bangalore last 
month to renegotiate the deal, there were reports doing the 
rounds in ISRO circles that India would get additional cryogenic 
engines, but not the technology. Official ISRO sources had 
refused to confirm or deny these reports. 
  But a recent agency report from Moscow, quoting Mr. Yuri 
Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, said cryogenic 
technology would not be transferred and India could get two 
additional cryogenic stages instead. This report has since been 
confirmed by highly reliable ISRO sources. 
  Russian interests: If these new terms are agreed 
to -- the renegotiated deal is reportedly yet to be finalised -- 
Russia would have effectively safeguarded its interests. Russia 
has completed a considerable part of the development of the 
cryogenic engine and stage, and is said to have received Rs. 102 
crores from India. Had India decided to cancel the deal, this 
development effort would have been wasted and Russia might have 
had to pay compensation as well. The new deal would allow Russia 
to salvage the contract in return for two additional stages. 
  The ISRO's acceptance of additional cryogenic stages, in 
lieu 
of technology appears motivated by a desire to avoid delays in 
developing cryogenic technology indigenously. The initial GSLVs 
would be launched with Russian cryogenic stages and indigenous 
development pursued alongside. The indigenous cryogenic stage 
could be ready in five years if there were no hitches, said one 
senior ISRO expert. But he also agreed that such hitches were 
common in cryogenic engine development and that other countries 
had taken twice as long. There is also said to be a provision 
for India to buy more cryogenic stages from Russia if indigenous 
development was not completed in time. 
  Cost factor: An important issue that will have to 
be considered is the cost. Under the earlier contract, the 
Rs.235 crores would have got India two stages as well as the 
technology to make the cryogenic engines and stages. The same 
money would now get India four stages. That works out to nearly 
Rs. 60 crores for each stage, the cost of an entire Polar 
Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). If more stages have to be 
bought, as they very well might be, that would push up the bill 
still further. There is no information available as yet on how 
much these cryogenic stages would cost. In addition, the ISRO 
will have to find the money to fund its own indigenous effort, 
which could cost Rs. 500 crores or more. 
  A crucial assumption appears to be that the GSLV can be 
launched, as earlier planned, in 1995-96. But with last year's 
failure of the PSLV as well as delays in the GSLV development 
programme, it is more likely that the GSLV will fly only by 
1998, according to ISRO experts themselves. If the indigenous 
cryogenic engine can be developed in five years as the ISRO 
claims, it should be possible to wait one more year and launch 
an entirely indigenous GSLV. The Russian cryogenic stages would 
then not be needed at all.

  [Text] The Hyderabad-based nuclear fuel complex has 
achieved a record production of 100,000 nuclear fuel rods. 
India is the fourth country in the world to have this 
capability. 
  [Begin correspondent Sanjiv Thomas recording] India has 
achieved self-sufficiency in the manufacture of nuclear fuel 
rods for power reactors. The Hyderabad-based nuclear fuel 
complex has to date produced 100,000 of these fuel bundles. 
These rods are made from uranium oxide, a zirconium alloy [as 
heard]. They are used for producing power in pressurized heavy 
water reactors. India is the fourth country to achieve this 
capability. The monthly production of these rods is about 
1,200, but it will soon touch 1,500. These rods are used at a 
rate of 2,000 per year at each nuclear reactor. India has seven 
running reactors and five are under construction. The nuclear 
fuel complex chairman, Dr. C. Ramrao, today released 100,000 
nuclear fuel bundles at a function at Hyderabad this afternoon.

  [Text] Bombay, January 14 -- The first research reactor, 
Apsara, commissioned in 1956 and operating satisfactorily, will 
be converted into a heavy water reflected core reactor to 
improve its utility. 
  This will also give the reactor a new lease of life and 
serve 
as technology stimulation for the design of a 510 MWt 
multi-purpose research reactor which has been developed by the 
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre recently, according to Dr. R. 
Chidambaram, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. 
  In his inaugural speech to the three-day, first annual 
symposium on "Ageing management of nuclear facilities" here 
today, he said the enormous cost of addition of new capacity and 
the lack of cleared sites for new nuclear power plants had made 
planners think of extending the operation of existing nuclear 
power plants and pilot plant studies had been initiated in a big 
way abroad. 
  Continued operation of the existing nuclear power plants as 
long as it was safe and economical to do so should be an 
important element in any nation's energy strategy to meet their 
growing need for electrical power, he said. (His speech was read 
out in his absence.) 
  He said the second research reactor, Cirus, (40MWt) would be 
shut down for about one year for execution of refurbishing 
programme as during recent years excessive maintenance efforts 
were needed on some of the components due to ageing-related 
degradation. It was commissioned in 1960. With refurbishing, its 
useful life was expected to be extended by 10 to 15 years, or 
even more. 
  The Tarapur atomic power station (TAPS) commissioned in 1969 
had not yet run its normal full course of design life. Dr. 
Chidamabaram said studies should be undertaken to understand the 
ageing mechanism of critical components of this nuclear plant 
and methods of assessing the residual life which will be based 
on vigorous inspections being carried out. 
  Referring to stoppage of fuel supply from abroad along with 
the embargo put earlier on the supply of critical spares for 
TAPS, as it completes 25 years, the AEC chairman said the 
problems were being tackled by way of development of Mixed Oxide 
(MOX) fuel to continue operation and also by undertaking 
development of certain critical spares with the help of Indian 
industries as also in-house development work in DAE 
establishments. Results of studies had shown that TAPS could be 
operated for up to 40 full power years. 
  As regards ageing management of TAPS was concerned, critical 
components and ageing mechanisms to which each was subjected to 
had been categorised. A criteria had been evolved to categorise 
a component as critical, based on its potential to cause 
spreading of radiation within the site and beyond the plant 
boundaries, if it were to fail abruptly. 
  Incorporation of special design features in new plants was 
being considered towards easy replacement of such critical 
components. The reactor vessel was the main critical component. 
  Components of the pressurised heavy water reactors were also 
being studied. 
  Dr. A. Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the Atomic Energy 
Regulatory Board, delivering the topical address, outlined the 
technical requirements for safety assessment of ageing nuclear 
power stations and steps to identify the critical structures and 
components. 
  He lauded the R&amp;D efforts at BARC and the Indira Gandhi 
Centre for Atomic Research at Kalpakkam in bringing about an 
understanding of complex phenomena associated with ageing of 
nuclear facilities and in the development of tools and 
techniques to measure and mitigate these effects. AREB would 
like the department of atomic energy to promote increased 
involvement of academic institutions, national research 
institutes and industry to accelerate the progress of such work. 
  Mr. A.N. Prasad, director, BARC, noted that more than 400 
nuclear power reactors were operational in the world, producing 
nearly 16 per cent of the total electricity generated globally. 
  By the turn of the century, 160 to 170 nuclear power 
reactors 
of different designs would have reached a service life of 25 
years, or more. A very large number of research reactors would 
also have reached the end of their service life by them, 
awaiting decommissioning. 
  He said ageing related issues were under critical 
examination 
in the R&amp;D studies of several organisations. BARC had 
undertaken 
a systematic study of identification of critical materials, 
components and systems of the pressurised heavy water reactors 
as well as the severity of operating and environmental stresses. 
Several techniques and software had been developed and were 
being applied for condition monitoring notable among them being 
current signatures for motor-operated valves in the emergency 
core cooling system and vibration signatures for the pumps in 
the coolant circuits and surface temperature of electrical 
systems to mention a few. 
  Mr. S.K. Chatterjee, managing director of Nuclear Power 
Corporation, said the safety levels of nuclear power plants were 
not deteriorating with age because of the continued monitoring 
and assessment being made and the required level of safety met 
at all times. He, however, said while dealing with the issue of 
ageing management of nuclear plant one had to keep in mind the 
fact that public acceptance was likely to play a significant 
role in plant life cycle decision-making. 
  Internationally, the ageing issue especially of nuclear 
power 
plants was assuming a great importance. The nuclear energy 
agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development had created an international expert working group on 
plant life management to achieve a systematic and higher level 
collaboration among its member countries in Europe on these 
issues.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 16, IRNA -- A morning daily here 
Wednesday quoted a senior Iranian officials as saying that it is 
contention of the Persian Gulf countries that a peace process as 
distinguished from a process of force, intimidation, 
suppression, submission and surrender has never been embarked 
upon in the region. 
  The English daily TERHAN TIMES quoted Deputy Foreign 
Minister 
Mohammad Javad Zarif who addressed the United Nations Institute 
for Disarmament Research in Geneva Tuesday. 
  Referring to "a few" countries succumbing to the will of the 
big powers, Zarif said such actions instead of leading to peace 
and stability will only entrench the same threat perceptions 
which will lead to "further insecurity and instability." 
  The "past erroneous approaches and perceptions" deter the 
common attempts "towards a better world order", the daily quoted 
Zarif as saying. 
  He proposed the creation of a forum by Persian Gulf 
countries 
to discuss "security issues, threat perceptions and other 
concerns", ther paper added. 
  Zarif deliberated on the fundamental issues related to 
regional security and to the long-term peace prospects, the 
daily noted. 
  The paper concluded by saying that he mainly discussed the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, specially nuclear, 
and advocated the creation of a zone free of such weapons.

<F P=106> [Article by Military Affairs editor] </F>
  [Text] Since the end of the Gulf war, Iran has turned into 
the most dangerous country in the area by virtue of its pursuit 
of a massive rearmament policy encompassing conventional, 
chemical ,and nuclear weaponry, to the degree that all of the 
classified military reports warn continually of the Iranian 
threat looming over the Gulf. The situation has prompted a 
return of the arms race to the countries of the region, which 
have sought to obtain defensive systems. Dubai's recent airshow 
is a reflection of this anxiety-driven climate, wherein all 
weapons-manufacturing countries [exhibitions] had crowds. What 
is the true nature of the Iranian threat, and how should the 
countries of the region confront it? 
  Weeks after the end of the Gulf war, the major 
industrialized 
countries called for the imposition of an embargo on weapons 
exports to the developing nations. In the opinion of the 
"majors," advanced weaponry in the hands of the "minors" would 
necessarily lead to the flare-up of wars, in contrast to the 
situation among the former. Rearmament among the majors has a 
deterrent goal; in essence, the availability of effective 
weaponry to a given state leads to other states' fearing to 
attack it. This logic underlay the formation of the "nuclear 
strike force" in France during the reign of General Charles de 
Gaulle. The rationale was that the existence of such a 
formidable force in France, in the first and last instance, 
would be a deterrent to others against launching a war against 
France, and not that France would launch a nuclear attack 
against the enemy. All nuclear nations adopted this Gaullist 
nuclear logic, and none deviated from it except for Russia, 
recently. A fortnight ago, the Russian minister of defense 
stated that his country would respond with nuclear weapons to 
any attack on its territory using conventional weapons. 
  Addressing members of Congress in March 1991, one week after 
the end of the Gulf war, former U.S. President George Bush 
expressed his fear of the smaller countries' arming, especially 
those of the Middle East. "It is catastrophic, now that the war 
is over, for Middle Eastern and Arab Gulf countries to enter a 
new arms race." 
  Bush failed in the U.S. presidential elections, and with him 
fell the theory of arms limitation (in the Middle East and 
elsewhere), because the weapons-manufacturing lobby has the 
ability to find any justification for selling weapons, and even 
for participating in the escalation of regional crises and 
tensions in order that the volume of sales not be affected. 
  What has survived is merely the theory of the prevention of 
the deployment of (nuclear, biological, and chemical) weapons of 
mass destruction. 
  Dubai's recent airshow witnessed the largest gathering of 
producers of civilian and military aircraft, missiles, 
electronics, and radars, not to mention radar jamming equipment. 
  Russia staged an aerial demonstration of the "Sukhoi 35," 
its 
latest aircraft. Besides its aircraft, Britain dispatched Crown 
Prince Charles to carry out public relations for the British 
aircraft manufacturers. France sent its minister of defense and 
industry, who doubles as the minister of foreign trade. 
  Warplane manufacturers' mouths watered when the UAE [United 
Arab Emirates] announced its desire to purchase 80 advanced 
fighter aircraft at a cost of no less than $10 billion. Experts 
have estimated the cost of arms purchases in the Gulf area for 
the remainder of the century at $65 billion. 
  There is competition between the United States and France 
for 
the arms market, with the United States ahead by leagues. Since 
1990, [the United States] has sold $39 billion worth of weapons 
to the countries of the region. As for France, do not forget 
that it was Iraq's primary arms supplier prior to the Gulf war. 
Thirty percent of its military exports in the years 1982, 1983, 
1984, and 1985 were to Iraq alone (13 billion French francs per 
year), and 70 percent of its military sales were to Middle 
Eastern and North African countries. France has succeeded in 
striking large deals in at least three Gulf countries, the most 
significant of which is the provision of 436 large LeClerc tanks 
to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. 
  In addition to the United States and France, Russia (which 
dominated the advanced countries' markets in the region during 
the Soviet Union era), Italy, Britain and Germany were 
represented, not to mention new countries such as South Africa 
and the Czech Republic, in addition to China and North Korea. 
  Prior to the Gulf war, Iraqi leaders were under the 
impression that their country had become the primary regional 
military power following the end of the Iraqi-Iranian war in 
mid-1988. 
<H5>  Iranian Arsenal </H5>
  Following the Gulf war and the defeat of the Iraqi Army, 
Iran 
once again stood out as a regional military power. The rulers of 
Tehran drafted a large rearmament program based on a declared 
annual military outlay of $8 billion. This vast sum drained the 
Iranian budget and overburdened the Iranian economy and is the 
reason for the inflation now extant in Iran, as well as the poor 
exchange rate of the Iranian currency. 
  The focus of Iran's military programs was its naval fleet. 
The prevailing view is that Iran has purchased three 
"Kilo"-class Russian submarines, taken delivery of two of them, 
and is awaiting delivery of the last one at the start of next 
year. However, it has recently been revealed that the "Kilo" 
submarine deal signed by Iran with Russia involves seven, not 
three, submarines. 
  Each "Kilo" submarine is capable of carrying 18 torpedoes or 
36 naval mines, and is equipped with four surface-to-air 
"SAM-16" missiles. In early 1993, Iran received an estimated 
1,800 "Kilo"-compatible naval mines. 
  The most important development in the rearmament of Iran, 
however, has been its formation of a squadron of "Sukhoi 24" 
strike fighters. In the opinion of American military experts in 
the region, the threat to shipping in the Gulf that is posed by 
these aircraft is greater than that posed by the "Kilo" 
submarines. 
  Negotiations are in their advanced states between Iran and 
China on the supply to Iran of 10 "Hegu" fast boats equipped 
with "Ying-Ji" antiship missiles with a range of 40 km. 
  A report entitled "The Strategic Plan for the Intelligence 
World in the Nineties," submitted by CIA Director James Woolsey 
to the U.S. Congress, states that Iran most probably will be the 
first country to obtain the 1000-km-range 
North-Korean-manufactured "Nodong" missile, and that within six 
years it will be capable of manufacturing the "Scud-B" and 
"Scud-C" short-range missiles, in addition to the "Nodong" 
missile. 
<H5>  Defensive Measures </H5>
  In the face of the Iranian threat to control navigation in 
the waters of the Arab Gulf, Arab Gulf countries undertook 
effective defensive measures to counter the Iranian mines. The 
minesweeper deals concluded by three Gulf countries fall under 
this category. Also, the Gulf cruisers and fast missile boats 
are a practical response to the Iranian cruisers and boats. Gulf 
Cooperation Council countries enjoy close military cooperation, 
and in most of them there is in place an integrated air defense, 
monitoring and early warning system. The Saudi "Peace Shield" 
system operates during peacetime at the same level of total 
efficiency as did "Desert Storm" during wartime. Gulf countries 
enjoy greater material capabilities and capacity for defensive 
provisioning than does Iran. Thus, Iran's policy of 
"muscle-flexing" remains limited and indicative of 
short-sightedness. It would have been more advantageous for the 
rulers of Tehran to have directed oil revenues to investments 
and developmental causes for the benefit of their people than to 
have utilized them for the purchase of arms and the 
impoverishment of their citizens.

  [Text] Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has 
asserted that Iraq has complied with Security Council Resolution 
687 on weapons of mass destruction and no longer has any of 
these weapons or the capacity to manufacture them. 
  In a statement to Qatari state television last night, he 
said 
that although Iraq implemented the provisions of that 
resolution, it is repeatedly accused of failure to abide by 
international resolutions for political reasons and to maintain 
the blockade imposed on it. 
  He added that U.S.-led foreign parties in the Security 
Council have political purposes unrelated to the [Gulf] crisis. 
  This is the second time the Qatari television has held an 
interview with Iraqi officials. A week ago, it aired a report 
on the unjust blockade, including an interview with Trade 
Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih.

  [Text] To hide them from the eyes of international 
inspectors, the regime of tyrant Saddam Husayn has been 
transferring its remaining chemical and biological weapons from 
one place to another. According to people who recently arrived 
in Amman, the dictatorial regime began using the oil pipelines 
-- out of operation because of the international embargo -- in 
one last attempt to hide its banned weapons.

  [Text] Manama, Feb 11 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency has set up two cameras at an Iraqi nuclear site 
under UN resolutions for the long-term monitoring of the 
country's arms program, an IAEA official said here Friday. 
  "Two close-circuit cameras have been installed and activated 
in an engineering facility at Um al-Ma'arik (Mother of All 
Battles), 20 minutes from Baghdad, with two film cameras as a 
back-up," said Gary Dillon, a Briton, about the site that was 
part of Iraq's enriched uranium production program. 
  "The work was carried out without a hitch and the Iraqis 
were 
cooperative," said Dillon about his seven-member IAEA team that 
just completed a week-long mission in Iraq. 
  On Feb 4, IAEA deputy chief Maurizio Zifferero said experts 
from his agency would remove the last batch of Iraq's irradiated 
fuel and start setting up cameras at former nuclear sites. 
  The team was to have arranged removal of the five kilograms 
(11 pounds) of fuel believed to be left in Iraq. Some 35 
kilograms (77 pounds) were removed on December 5. 
  "The IAEA team will be back within two months to continue 
their work of installing surveillance cameras at maybe two or 
three more sites, where up to 20 cameras may be set up in 
total," Dillon said. 
  Another 11 chemical weapons experts, led by Horst Reeps from 
Germany, accompanied Dillon's team on Friday. It completed a 
10-day mission to identify and collect equipment Iraq had used 
in producing chemical weapons. 
  "We completed our mission of identifying, tagging and filing 
250 pieces of chemical production equipment of dual use nature. 
Part of these were used during the Iran-Iraq war," Reeps said. 
  "Our main aim was to get more information on the planned use 
of this equipment in the future. Iraq has said it intends to 
make use of them for the production of pesticides, 
pharmaceuticals and other chemicals," he said. 
  He said that some of the equipment was never used, some used 
on a regular basis and some would be the subject of new 
discussions with the Iraqis on their planned use. 
  In the hope of obtaining an end to a three-year embargo, 
Iraqi authorities are cooperating with efforts to dismantle 
programs for making weapons of mass destruction which are banned 
under UN resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war. 
  The embargo was imposed four days after Iraq's forces 
invaded 
Kuwait in August 1990.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "JANA's international affairs editor"] </F>
  [Text] The British defense minister announced that Britain 
is studying the development of its own defense system, claiming 
that countries such as Libya constitute a nuclear threat to 
Britain. The British newspaper THE DAILY EXPRESS reported this 
statement, coupling it by saying that Libya will be able to 
manufacture nuclear weapons within 10 years. 
  JANA's international affairs editor commented by saying: 
This British official statement is further proof that the 
Christians are attacking the Muslims within the framework of the 
Christian-Jewish alliance against Islam. The nuclear weapons 
that now exist include 200 nuclear warheads owned by the Jews 
who occupy Palestine, and they admit owning them despite their 
refusal to sign the Nonproliferation Treaty. No one has talked 
about these nuclear warheads. No one mentioned them or asked 
for their removal. 
  As for Libya, the peaceful country that neither has the 
capability to own nuclear weapons nor is interested in or 
thinking of owning nuclear weapons, and which is subject to the 
annual inspection by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] because of its signing of the Nonproliferation Treaty, 
it is accused of this [constituting a danger] and other similar 
accusations, as if its signing of the Nonproliferation Treaty 
and the regular IAEA inspection are not sufficient. This shows 
that the reason for these and other accusations is the fact that 
the Libyan weapons are not directed against the Arabs. Since 
the Jewish weapons are directed against the Arabs and Muslims 
this is allowed and there are no objections to it. 
  Why? The answer is simply the fact that in the eyes of the 
Christians and Jews the Arabs are animals or a race that no one 
wants and should be annihilated. 
  The editor added: Through this statement the world can see 
the practices of terrorism against peaceful peoples. This 
statement, and the statements that preceded it by the U.S. 
President, saying that Libya constitutes an extraordinary 
danger, are in themselves real, unprecedented terrorism 
practiced by superpowers against a peaceful country. 
  The international affairs editor concluded his comment by 
saying: 
  These are the characteristics of the new world order to 
which 
they call: Terrorism, Jewish and Christian alliance against all 
non-Jewish religions such as Islam, Buddhism, and Confucianism, 
in order to establish Jewish and Christian control over the 
whole world.

<F P=106> [Article by Habibur Rahman: "U.S. Spy Planes' Flights Over </F>
Pakistan's Sensitive Regions?"; from the "Islamabad Diary" 
Column] 
  [Excerpt] A team comprising five U.S. experts is currently 
visiting Islamabad. These experts are the representatives of 
the U.S. agency which oversees arms control and nuclear 
nonproliferation matters. Their duties include, among other 
things, providing necessary information and advice to the U.S. 
secretary of state. During its talks with the Pakistani 
authorities, the U.S. team will discuss when and how the next 
step for rolling back Pakistan's nuclear program will be taken 
and what method needs to be adopted to verify Pakistan's 
compliance with the commitment it will make in this context. 
Pakistan's former caretaker Prime Minister Dr. Moin Qureshi 
announced on 24 September 1993 that Islamabad had frozen its 
nuclear program. After this announcement, the U.S. State 
Department issued a statement, saying that Washington is 
strongly opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and 
the governments of the South Asian countries have been asked to 
halt their nuclear programs forthwith and eventually destroy all 
their weapons of mass annihilation. The U.S. Government also 
wants to settle all stages of rolling back Pakistan's nuclear 
program in a manner which could ensure the continued 
verification of the fact that Islamabad is winding up its 
nuclear program. The aforementioned U.S. experts, currently in 
Islamabad, would probably also like to know and see how far 
Washington's instructions have been complied with, when and how 
the next steps will be taken, and in what ways Washington can 
feel assured in this regard. 
  A U.S. aircraft has remained parked at the Chaklala airport 
in Rawalpindi since 5 January 1994. This is the plane that 
brought to Pakistan a troop of 150 U.S. military commandos who 
have apparently been sent to conduct joint exercises with the 
Pakistani Army commandos. Most of these exercises have been 
held in the Cherat region, where the headquarters of the 
Pakistani Army commandos is located. Recently, a letter was 
published in a Pakistani daily, in which the writer stated that 
the geographical features of Cherat region are largely similar 
to those of the Kahuta area, where Pakistan's nuclear laboratory 
is located, and which the U.S. has been eyeing. The writer of 
that letter had asked whether the U.S. commandos' exercise in 
the Cherat region is not a prelude to preparations for action 
against the Kahuta laboratory. The U.S. plane now standing at 
the Chaklala airport is called MC130-H in air force jargon and 
is equipped with very sensitive equipment for photography. This 
equipment includes the capability of carrying out the most 
sophisticated spying work. With the help of this equipment, the 
aircraft can prepare any maps that are desired and freeze a 
radar system. Even total darkness cannot hamper its work. 
According to a published report, this U.S. reconnaissance plane 
has flown several times over Pakistan's northern areas, 
especially over Chitral, Swat, Chilas, Gilgit, Skardu, and 
Deosai, since 5 January 1994. The U.S. possesses only four 
planes of this type. The cost of each of these aircraft is 
stated to be $96 million. During the rule of late President 
Field Marshal Ayub Khan, the United States was allowed to 
establish a base at (Badaber) near Peshawar to carry out aerial 
espionage against the former Soviet Union. The U.S. U-2 spy 
planes used to fly from this Pakistani base into the Soviet 
airspace. The Russians shot down one of these U-2 spy planes. 
After his arrest, the U.S. pilot of that spy plane confirmed the 
presence of a U.S. espionage base on Pakistani soil. Durrani, a 
managing director of the Pakistan International Airlines [PIA], 
was accused of cooperating with the United States in installing 
spying equipment on a PIA plane that used to fly over the 
People's Republic of China. That incident took place during the 
rule of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. During the regime of President 
General Mohammad Ziaul Haq, the U.S.' CIA was given the facility 
to set up a base in Pakistan's northern areas to fight with the 
Soviet Union in Afghanistan and in that way Pakistan was turned 
into the biggest CIA base. Now, the presence of the 
aforementioned U.S. spy plane at Chaklala airport in Rawalpindi 
and its activities tend to indicate that the U.S. has been given 
a free hand to use Pakistani soil to carry out spying on 
Pakistan itself, and the valiant United States has been making 
full use of this freedom. [passage omitted on Kashmir-related 
issues]

<F P=106> [Report by Javed Syed] </F>
  [Text] Lahore, Feb 23 -- Former Chief of the Army Staff 
[COAS], General (Retd) Mirza Aslam Beg has admitted that the 
decision for capping the nuclear programme had been taken in the 
meeting of trioka in January 1989. 
  But he explained the matter in a different way. He said 
Pakistan had attained complete nuclear ability including the 
development of delivery system of the bomb to its target 
alongwith the ability for manufacturing the required number of 
devices at the time of need. 
  Addressing a gathering of lawyers and journalists at a local 
hotel arranged by Manzoor Qadir Advocate, he said on the 
occasion of taking the decision for halting the nuclear 
programme, Pakistan had full knowledge of India's nuclear 
ability as well as the number of devices it had. He said at 
that time Pakistan was in a position to respond to India on 
atomic front. 
  He said the capping of nuclear programme meant that the 
manufacturing of the devices should be halted. But the 
development of nuclear technology and the delivery system should 
be continued. 
  Replying to a question, he said be had no knowledge that 
Benazir Bhutto had provided any help to Rajiv Gandhi during his 
tenure as COAS. Answering another question, he rejected the 
perception that Pakistan Army was involved in making and 
breaking the governments in the country. 
  He said the Opposition and ruling party politicians had been 
trying always to drag the Army into the polities for cover-up to 
their misdeeds. He pointed out that only General Ayub Khan, 
Yahya Khan and General Zia had willingly interfered in politics. 
He said now the thinking of the Army had changed and the Armed 
Forces would never seize power in future. 
  He said if the politicians strengthened the democratic 
process in the country the little interference of Army into the 
political affairs would also come to an end. 
  He said be would soon decide to take part in politics. He 
said either he would float his own party or would join some 
political party of the country. However, he said he would make 
this announcement from Lahore. He said he would create a 
leadership from grass-roots level as the problems of 95 per cent 
of the poor and middle class could not be addressed by the 
privileged class in power. 
  He said the return of the representatives of the poor and 
middle class in the assemblies was necessary to resolve the 
acute problems of the country. 
  He said he wanted to see the people in power and that was 
why 
he had refused to take over the country in August 1988. He said 
if the present confrontation continued the people would soon get 
fed up with the politicians. He said the politicians lack 
vision necessary to run the government.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan and India -- the U.S. Double Standard </F>
and the Requirements of National Defense"] 
  [Text] According to a clarification by the U.S. State 
Department, the Pressler Amendment has been included in the 
foreign aid bill currently lying before the Congress and the 
previous restrictions against Pakistan have been retained, under 
which Pakistan will not be able to receive aid from the United 
States without abandoning its nuclear program nor can Islamabad 
purchase U.S. weapons through other sources. This can result in 
India taking a lead over Pakistan not only in the nuclear 
program but also in the field of conventional weapons, thereby 
causing difficulties for Pakistan's defense. 
  The discriminatory treatment meted out by the United States 
to Pakistan does not beggar description. In spite of the fact 
that Pakistan has been tied up with the United States through a 
defense agreement since 1959, Washington never felt it necessary 
to maintain its friendship with Islamabad, except for a brief 
period during the Afghan war when the U.S. realized the danger 
that the advancement of the former Soviet Union toward the hot 
waters would have jeopardized the global power equilibrium. 
However, Washington turned its eyes away from Pakistan after 
the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan and its 
subsequent disintegration, and the same Pakistan, which was said 
to be a cornerstone of the U.S. foreign policy during the Afghan 
war, discovers itself being called a "fundamentalist," 
"terrorist" state and the standard bearer of the "Islamic bomb." 
The United States then not only stopped its own aid to Pakistan 
but also began efforts to persuade the entire world to follow 
suit. Japan, which has been the largest aid donor to Pakistan, 
also stopped providing assistance under the influence of the 
U.S. propaganda and pressure, and categorically stated to the 
then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, in December 1992 that it 
would be difficult for Islamabad to receive any Japanese aid if 
it did not forgo its nuclear program, reduce military 
expenditure, and create a favorable atmosphere for the purpose. 
Two days ago, Japan once again reiterated its conditions and 
showed a red signal to the new Pakistani Government as well. 
  It is ironical that India has also openly declared itself to 
be a nuclear power in the Indian Subcontinent, but neither the 
United States nor Europe nor Japan has objected to India about 
this. New Delhi, actually, enjoys complete freedom in 
stockpiling enriched uranium, making advances in the development 
of delivery systems, and in amassing conventional weapons. 
Thus, deliberate attempts are being made to weaken Pakistan's 
defense, which is apparently aimed at leaving us on the mercy of 
New Delhi and forcing us to accept India's supremacy. 
  Pakistan's nuclear scientists Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan has said 
that weakness in any country's defense is tantamount to inviting 
enemy's aggression. He has suggested that we should manufacture 
our own weapons, so that we can become a nuclear power by 
achieving self- reliance in defense equipment and defend our 
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. The 
Pakistan Government should also urge the United States to 
forsake its discriminatory and biased attitude toward Pakistan 
and tell Washington that if it desires to help end the nuclear 
arms race in the Indian Subcontinent, then it should adopt a 
realistic and equitable policy and also pressure India, along 
with Pakistan, to roll back or freeze its nuclear program. It 
is the moral duty of the valiant United States to ensure the 
supply of F-16's and other equipment for which it has already 
received payments, so that Pakistan can be able to defend itself 
from India at least in the field of conventional weapons. Trade 
ethics also demand that we must get the items for which we have 
already made payments. We have been emphasizing in these 
columns that the country's real strength lies in its internal 
unity and national solidarity. We will have to turn ourselves 
into an impregnable (?wall) to defeat the enemy. Our leadership 
should therefore pay attention to this issue as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Lashch and Fedor Maksimov: "Abandoned </F>
Missile System Discovered. Armored Missile Train Lost in Perm 
Forests"] 
  [Text] An abandoned rail-based strategic missile 
system has been discovered on the railroad tracks near Perm. The 
discovery by the group of Perm journalists headed by the 
department chief of the oblast newspaper MOLODAYA GVARDIYA, Oleg 
Andriyashkin, was the result of an investigation they conducted: 
The reporters' attention was drawn to the fact that electronic 
equipment intended for "defense purposes" had begun to appear on 
the local market, and then they found the RS-22. After the 
journalists contacted the leaders of the missile forces, the 
six-car train was placed under guard. Yesterday the 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY editorial staff learned the details of the 
incident. 
  The Perm journalists reported to the KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
editorial offices that at the Kurya Station of the Perm Railroad 
they had discovered a six-car train which, they thought, 
contained an RS-22 rail-based strategic missile system. 
  The rail-based RS-22 strategic system is better known 
as the SS-24. It is usually "disguised" as passenger cars or 
refrigerated cars. One system contains up to 10 strategic 
missiles with a target radius of up to 10,000 km. These systems 
were produced in Ukraine in Dnepropetrovsk. They have now been 
removed from production. At the present time they are still on 
combat alert. 
  As the Perm journalist Oleg Andriyashkin told a 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the reporters managed to freely 
enter two cars whose doors had been opened (nobody was guarding 
the equipment). The first of the cars was an electric power 
plant and the second was the main command post. The doors of the 
other four cars, which presumably contained missiles and missile 
fuel, were blocked. The journalists noted that there had been 
some looting of the equipment in the cars. Most likely it was 
not foreign spies who had found their way here but thrifty 
citizens of the country who were interested in the instruments, 
which contain gold and silver and other valuable metals. In 
Andriyashkin's opinion, saboteurs would not be able to use the 
missile system for its intended purpose. The danger came from 
the marauders, who could carelessly set one of the cars on fire.

<FIG ID=JPRS-TND-006-30A>           Today, little remains of the "electronics" aboard the train.. </FIG>




  As the deputy chief of the Perm Oblast administration, 
Yevgeniy Sapiro, told a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the 
missile system that was discovered is now being used as a 
training facility of the Perm Higher Military School of Missile 
Forces. Representatives of the training institution refrained 
from commentary, alluding to a leadership conference that was 
taking place at that moment. In the press group of the Main 
Commissariat of Strategic Missile Forces (RVSN) they said that 
they had no information on this question: "These missile systems 
are on combat alert and are guarded reliably enough." 
  A worker of the press service of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, Vladimir Murashkin, said that the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service knows about the military 
school's written-off training train located at the Kurya station 
of the Perm Railroad, which contains training missiles with the 
warheads removed. From the standpoint of state security the 
system is of no special interest to foreign intelligence 
services--the American military were familiarized with similar 
missile systems not very long ago.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Chemical Weapons Threaten Volga </F>
Region. Deadline for Their Destruction May Not Be Met"] 
  [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Around now a terminal was to have 
been built on the banks of the Volga in Saratov Oblast to strip 
out [peretarivaniye] chemical agents from their containers 
[yemkosti] and subsequently detoxify them. That at least is 
what the draft first stage of the state program for the 
destruction of chemical weapons envisages. However, local 
residents, worried by leaks at stores that have been here a long 
time, have sounded the alarm and are objecting to new 
installations with this kind of specialism. 
  Russia's president signed the Paris Convention on the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons a year ago, in January 1993. 
According to the Convention, the first installation for the 
destruction of chemical agents must be tested within two years 
at most. Half this time has already elapsed and Russia still 
has no laws, no concept, no approved state program for chemical 
weapons destruction. Meanwhile leaks of poisonous substances 
from containers that have eroded have been recorded at the 
arsenal sited on the territory of Saratov Oblast. 
  The village of Gornyy, where 690 tonnes of mustard gas, 225 
tonnes of lewisite, and 210 tonnes of their compounds are 
stored, is not far from the Volga. The chemical weapons that 
have been here for ages, packed in metal barrels and railroad 
tankers, pose a potential danger. 
  The strength of the harmful chemicals will be reduced by a 
factor of 1,000-10,000 when the chemical agents are stripped out 
at the new terminal. The plan is to reprocess the reactive 
matter obtained in Shikhany, 100 km from Gornyy, where the 
top-secret State Institute of Organic Synthesis Technology 
[SIOST], which developed chemical weapons in the recent past, is 
located. 
  Doctor of Sciences Aleksandr Kochergin, the institute's 
director, said that several technologies have been developed for 
the destruction of the stocks from the arsenal in Gornyy. 
Whereas the situation is clear with regard to the mustard gas, 
a choice has not yet been made with regard to the lewisite and 
its compounds. In the opinion of SIOST scientists, the most 
preferable option is for this kind of chemical agent to be 
recycled [utilizatsiya] since it contains costly arsenic used in 
microelectronics, laser technology, optics, and pharmaceuticals. 
In other words, the recycling technology presupposes not only 
expenditure on chemical weapons destruction but also 
considerable income from the reprocessing of chemical agents 
into particularly pure arsenic, which Russia does not currently 
produce. 
  This technology can also be used to recycle 
arsenic-containing adamsite -- an irritant chemical agent 
produced early this century, which has been shipped to Shikhany 
from throughout the former Union -- of which more than 8,000 
tonnes have been buried straight in the ground at the testing 
range of the military institute next to SIOST. The huge Russian 
adamsite dump is a source of great worry not only to the public 
but also to scientists, who are voicing misgivings over the 
possible environmental contamination from these stocks. 
  It may seem to the uninitiated that there are no particular 
problems with the destruction of the Saratov arsenal. It is 
only the choice of technology and the construction of a terminal 
and recycling installations that are holding things up. 
However, one must not forget that we are talking about chemical 
weapons, which are to be destroyed in densely populated areas 
right next to the Volga. This is a very sensitive subject for 
the residents of the area since the environmental background 
here is unfavorable enough as it is. In the city of Volsk, for 
instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow 
flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times 
in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to 
three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which 
contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process. 
  People's disquiet is intensified by the constant rumors 
about 
the danger of radiological contamination of the area from the 
Balakovo nuclear electric power station 50 km from Volsk. Add to 
that atmospheric discharges by Balakovo's big chemical giants 
and you will understand the public concern, which is threatening 
to develop into an organized protest against the siting of 
chemical weapons destruction facilities bin these areas. 
  This disquiet is intensified by conjecture and speculation 
due to the utter secrecy surrounding the facilities at Shikhany. 
I visited them, spoke with scientists, and saw that there is no 
intention of building any more production units here, the former 
technology used for the synthesis of chemical agents has merely 
been reversed. According to the findings of a special 
environmental and medical monitoring laboratory, the air in 
Shikhany is considerably cleaner than in Volsk, people live 
longer and have fewer illnesses. 
  Choosing the technology is only part of the problem and by 
no 
means the most important part. Social and environmental 
questions are the main thing. Mikhail Yakovlev, Saratov Oblast 
Administration department head, briefed me on a Russian 
Government draft decree that the residents of the oblast have 
prepared on their own initiative. It enshrines their immediate 
demands without whose fulfillment the chemical weapons 
destruction process cannot be started. During the first quarter 
of this year the Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical 
and Biological Weapons under the Russian President and the 
Ministry of Defense, in conjunction with other departments, are 
asked to define a concept, prepare drafts of a basic law and a 
number of other legislative acts designed to form the legal base 
for the practical implementation of the Paris Convention, and 
guarantee safety, health, and social protection. According to 
civilized norms, the facilities for the storage and destruction 
of chemical weapons and the population centers around them 
should be given special status with all the concomitant 
guarantees, as is the case in the United States for instance. 
  The demand for regular environmental and medical monitoring 
is also natural. During the first stage, before the 
experimental installations begin work, the intention is to study 
the state of the environment and carry out a comprehensive 
screening process involving residents in Volskiy and 
Krasnopartizanskiy Rayons, which include Shikhany and Gornyy, in 
order to determine the consequences of the storage and testing 
of chemical weapons on the environment and the population's 
health. 
  The importance of the social and environmental aspects can 
be 
judged from the funding structure, where expenditure on 
monitoring and the social everyday sphere in Shikhany, Volsk, 
and Gornyy amounts to 67 billion rubles [R] of the R72 billion 
that the oblast administration deems it necessary to allocate 
for the entire first phase of the program, a phase culminating 
in the construction and testing of the experimental-industrial 
facility for the destruction and recycling of chemical agents 
and the creation of the requisite support infrastructure. 
  Nadezhda Saratovtseva, head of administration of the 
settlement of Shikhany, has a better knowledge of the whole set 
of problems than anyone else. She takes part without fail in 
all the meetings and talks on this topic and has even addressed 
parliamentary hearings. 
  "The state program for the destruction of chemical weapons 
has been in the process of being written and draft laws have 
been in the process of being harmonized since 1989," she said. 
"Presidents, governments, and parliaments have come and gone, 
but still there are no laws and no program. There is no concept 
and no funding. The SIOST has not been paid for three months 
and that unique institution is on the verge of stoppages. The 
social sphere -- the burden of which is borne entirely by the 
institute -- is going to pieces." 
  Judging by the center's unhurried approach, one can 
confidently assume today that the schedule proposed by the 
Saratov administration in its draft government decree will also 
be disrupted. 
  "You produced the chemical weapons, you destroy them," 
Saratovtseva was told by one highly-placed Moscow official. 
  Meanwhile the chemical bomb planted almost on the very banks 
of the Volga may spring its surprise at any minute. In that 
case it would not only be the residents of Saratov on the Volga 
who would suffer.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Coulloudon in Moscow: "Russia: Chemical </F>
Threat, The Terrible Secret"] 
  [Text] Is the Russian chemical bomb a state secret or is it 
an open secret? In Moscow, professor Vil Mirzayanov is paying 
with his freedom his attempt to break the sacrosanct laws of 
secrecy and reveal to the general public what the experts have 
known for a long time. This is a curious fate for this Doctor 
Strangelove-type character, yesterday an honored scientist and 
today sharing his cell with common murderers! 
  The scandal came from where it was least expected. For 
decades, a handful of scientists have been working to develop 
the most lethal neuroparalysis gases that boast an effectiveness 
greater than that achieved by American experts. Guardians of 
the destructive formulae, they are now however threatening to 
reveal all in response to a sudden philanthropic impulse and the 
feeling that they have been conned and exploited by their 
superiors. The first revelation is that Russia has many more 
toxic substances than it officially admits to. At the Paris 
convention on chemical weapons signed last year, the Kremlin 
undertook to release the figures for its arsenal. It admitted to 
storing 40,000 tonnes of various substances, 32,000 tonnes of 
which were neuroparalytic. Vladimir Uglev, one of the three 
protesting scientists and one of the fathers of the binary bomb, 
states, however, that Moscow has already produced 80,000 tonnes 
of mustard gas alone -- the gas used for the first time at Ypres 
in Belgium and which was the terror of the infantrymen gassed by 
the Germans. 
  For these dissidents of military chemistry, the proof that 
Russia lied about the amount of chemical weapons it has is to be 
found at Chikhaniy, in the Saratov region not far from the 
Volga. Away from prying eyes, a constant stream of explosions 
releases thick clouds of toxic substances into the atmosphere. 
It is here that the army destroys its excess of chemical 
weapons before Western observers can notice the deception. All 
this occurs to the detriment of the most basic safety rules. 
  It is claimed that whole vats of toxic substances are buried 
or burned without any safety measures taken whatsoever. No 
surprise then, that it is at Chikhaniy that the highest number 
of ophthalmic lesions and eye cancers are recorded -- twice as 
many as in the rest of the country. 
  State secrecy means that medical information for the regions 
concerned also remains a closely guarded secret. However, we do 
know that a number of soldiers who took part in the destruction 
of mustard gas at the Kambark base in the sixties have since 
died of cancer. Near the Novocheboksariy region of central 
Russia, almost 90 percent of the population suffers from various 
types of pathological illness. In 1993, the 12,000 children of 
Chikhaniy developed twice as many respiratory illnesses as in 
the previous year while the number of complications 
quadrupled.... 
  In the east, the largest threat posed by the military 
chemical industry does not, however, lie simply in this 
half-truth. Russia has two powerful binary weapons capable of 
wiping out entire populations when their internal membrane 
splits to mix two individually inoffensive gases. The first of 
these weapons, named VX, is produced using chemical substances 
that are banned by the Paris convention and which should soon be 
destroyed. The second weapon, on the other hand, is the most 
fearful arm ever dreamed up in this domain -- fearful because it 
is untouchable. 
  According to Vladimir Uglev, the developer of the gas 
code-named A-232, the weapon's originality lies in the 
simplicity of its components which are used in civilian industry 
and which cannot therefore be regulated by international 
experts. "We know that the chemical parameters of such a weapon 
cannot escape the clutches of the generals or terrorists for 
long," Vladimir Uglev accepts. "The question is whether to make 
its composition public knowledge and so demand strict 
international control, or else wait for a "leak" to occur, 
despite our vigilance." 
  By concealing the results obtained during the A-232 research 
and accusing the developers of these weapons of "violating state 
secrecy," the Kremlin seems to have opted for the latter 
solution.

believed to be a seller of illegal and dangerous merchandise 
turned out to be an official courier delivering the material to 
Moscow. 
  Director of the research institute of nuclear reactors in

this is the usual way his institute transports radioactive 
sources to Moscow. 
  "We usually transport to the capital similar radioactive 
sources in ordinary passenger trains and we had never received 
any complaints because they pose no danger to human health", he 
said. 
  "Today the usual way of deliveries of sources of isotopes 
was 
disurpted for unknown reasons and was proclaimed criminal. This 
is an unpleasant misunderstanding", the director said hoping 
that his courier would be allowed to continue the trip.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Lvov report: "Nuclear Waste Will Be Destroyed by </F>
Explosions"] 
  [Text] This news is not for those of a nervous disposition: 
It is possible that in the foreseeable future all Russia's 
radioactive waste and chemical weapons will be destroyed...by 
nuclear explosion. By several explosions, to be precise, which 
will be detonated deep within the permafrost of Russia's only 
nuclear test site on the island of Novaya Zemlya. 
  This program has been expounded by Major General Vladimir 
Loborev, academician and chief of the Ministry of Defense 
Central Physics and Technical Institute, and Aleksandr 
Chernyshev, deputy director of the Federal Nuclear Center 
(Arzamas-16), in reports to a closed scientific seminar held at 
the "Uran" Science and Production Association, which your 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent managed to attend. 
Representatives from our most important organizations in this 
field attended the seminar: the Ministry of Defense, the 
Ministry of Atomic Power Engineering and Industry, the Federal 
Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the Ministry of 
Environment and Natural Resources, the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, and the Academy of Natural Sciences. 
  There are several ways of recycling radioactive waste. The 
idea of sending waste into space is the most utopian of these 
schemes, according to Vladimir Loborev. However, the most 
practical method is plunging the fatal waste into glass and 
burying it in "deep geological formations." The largest 
vitrification plant is located in France. It cost $500 million 
to build. 
  According to Loborev, to destroy all of Russia's waste would 
require 20 such plants, each of which would have to operate 
continuously for 10 years. The Russian economy would be unable 
to bear costs of this magnitude. But the problem is becoming 
increasingly acute -- obsolete ships with nuclear reactors that 
can neither be used nor scuttled are piling up at the piers of 
Severodvinsk and other ports.... 
  A nuclear explosion would be far less costly. And the 
authors of the plan claim that after the explosion the waste 
would be buried in accordance with all the regulations -- the 
extremely high temperature would turn the rock and the 
radioactive waste housed in underground passageways into an 
large vitreous mass which would be covered by a thick layer of 
compacted soil and rubble. Thus embedded, the waste would never 
be able to "surface"; besides, all around there is permafrost 
which, according to the specialists, would present no threat for 
many centuries, even if a subtropical climate were to occur on 
Novaya Zemlya. 
  The chemical weapons situation is somewhat more complex. In 
Russia it is kept in seven large storage facilities, some of 
which are located near major cities. They must be destroyed as 
soon as possible in accordance with international conventions 
and following the dictates of common sense, but the technology 
to do this does not exist at the present time. Scientists 
believe that in this case the "nuclear explosion" method looks 
more promising, although it would require some extremely complex 
chemical calculations. 
  The authors of the plan assure us that the program is at the 
scientific development stage and will under no circumstances be 
implemented without thorough expert assessments, international 
monitoring, explanations to the population, and, of course, 
presidential and government approval. In order to obtain the 
last item on this list, the plan would have to do the rounds of 
a number of competent departments. The seminar decided that it 
would be submitted for examination by the recently established 
Scientific Council under the Russian Federation Security Council. 
  We can only hope that amid all the current confusion in 
Russia, these important "formalities" will not be forgotten. 
After all, we already possess experience of the unpredictable 
behavior of the peaceful atom in Russia.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Tarasov report: "Siberian Military Plants on the </F>
Brink of Upheavals. There Is No Money and No Work"] 
  [Text] Krasnoyarsk -- The situation in the 
military-industrial complex' Siberian domains is becoming 
explosive: The many-thousands-strong collective of one of thje 
biggest production facilities in the Russian defense industry -- 
the Krasnoyarsk Machine Building Plant, a state enterprise upon 
which an order has been conferred -- is in a state of turmoil. 
The missile builders are taking a tough stand and demanding 
money and work. 
  On the last working day of last week around 500 people 
"besieged" the plant's management, and by evening practically 
the entire shift at the Krasnoyarsk Machinebuilding Plant was 
participating in an emergency meeting. General Director V. 
Gupalov was taken to hospital for intensive care, suffering from 
an attack of angina pectoris. The disturbances spilled over 
from the territory of the secret plant onto the streets; workers 
went off to see the governor in search of the truth, threatening 
to blockade the kray administration building and seal off the 
roads if he did not help immediately. 
  There was another meeting on Monday where, as the "Krasmash" 
directors informed IZVESTIYA, the collective by and large agreed 
with the proposals made by the plant's leadership for 
stabilizing the situation. Gupalov flew to Moscow. It has been 
said that the government has allocated money. But this money 
has not appeared yet. So a new outburst of passions may occur 
at any moment. 
  "Krasmash's" customer -- the Ministry of Defense -- has 
failed to pay the missile manufacturers 11.3 billion rubles [R] 
for the state order carried out last year. Wages have not been 
paid for four months, and there is no money for the absolute 
essentials. 
  Technical Director L. Kovrigin told IZVESTIYA that the plant 
leadership has appealed to the president, the premier, the 
Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Finance. At the end of 
December V. Chernomyrdin gave instructions for the debts to be 
paid off during January. Security Council Secretary O. Lobov 
reported that the president wrote the following resolution on 
the appeal from the missile manufacturers: For immediate and 
strict implementation. Nevertheless, the plant has not received 
the money. 
  The director's order on the closure of the assembly shops as 
of 15 February for six weeks -- as it stands at the moment -- 
has added fuel to the flames. Those who have not taken 
enforced leave will work three days a week (until now the plant 
has had a four-day week). The point is that in recent years, 
the Ministry of Finance has not only not been in a hurry to 
settle its accounts, but even to conclude contracts with the 
plant. Under the law on the state order, "Krasmash" should 
obtain a contract two years before the manufacturing deadline, 
since the cycle of manufacture of the articles takes up more 
than one year. The plant was meant to have been given an 
advance by 1 February for the purchase of vital materials. The 
contract has still not been signed and the money has not been 
transferred. This practice has become the norm. Others would 
doubtless interpret it as the fact that their services are no 
longer needed. But "Krasmash" has continued to selflessly forge 
the motherland's missile shield. The conversion of the leading 
brains in the military-industrial complex is a very difficult 
matter. Judging by his behavior, which is not consonant with 
the economic situation, the general director is continuing to be 
more worried about the Russian defense capability than about the 
fate of the labor collective entrusted to him. The director has 
remained a general, but has not become an entrepreneur. Which 
may be pleasant to the state, but not to the workers, the 
reserves of whose selfless devotion have run dry. 
  At the moment it is the local authorities who are settling 
up 
for the debts to the military-industrial complex. Governor V. 
Zubov has allocated 1 billion to the machine builders. This will 
be enough to pay October's wages and part of November's. The 
missile builders have received assistance from the budget by 
dint of their strength, although the situation of other groups 
in the population is scarcely much better. Workers in high 
schools, colleges, and universities are in a state of combat 
readiness for mass protest actions. The list of enterprises in 
the kray which have come to a standstill or are working at 
half-strength is breath-taking. The ship-building plant has 
just stopped carrying out the military order, and its workers 
have been sent off on a three-week vacation. The trade union 
committee has, of course, put forward some demands... The 
professional guardians of the people are increasingly feeling 
that they are "in their element." The unforgettable appeal to 
the proletariat to unite is in use again. Communists are 
proposing to extend the spheres of influence of the strike 
committees, and the executive committee of the "Trudovoye 
Krasnoyarye" movement is appealing for the formation of a united 
city strike committee. 
  The revolt at "Krasmash" has been brewing for a long time 
and 
seems to be entirely natural. At one time the empire of the 
missile builders had been divided into six plants, and in a 
single year of their free existence, matters took an upward turn 
for capable people. But in 1992, under pressure from the 
Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Industry, the State 
Committee for the Management of State Property scorned the laws, 
the opinion of the labor collectives, and economic expediency, 
and drove five plants into the stable of the military-industrial 
complex once again, thereby placing them under a single boss. 
Having glued together an unviable monster, the state has not 
nevertheless even determined whether it needs "the most 
important strategic output," on whose production "Krasmash" has 
the monopoly. No money is being found to pay for it. Well, if 
even the instructions of the president and the prime minister 
are not being carried out, should the basic production be carved 
up for scrap? After all, in principle it cannot respecialize. 
Or does Russia still need ballistic missiles for submarines and 
other complex military output? Why does the state allow chiefs 
of shops and workers and officials at local level to be 
tormented by these questions? 
  In the past we use to be called Upper Volta with missiles. I 
don't know about the Volta bit, although I suppose there is a 
similarity, but all the indications are that it may be tough as 
regards the missiles.

  [Text] Vladivostok February 15 TASS -- In conditions of 
acute power shortage, the administration of the Primorye 
territory, the Russian Far East, decided to consider the 
possibility of using reactors of nuclear submarines of the 
Pacific Fleet to generate electricity for Vladivostok power 
supply. 
  Technical and economic aspects of this unusual method of 
conversion of military facilities to civilian uses were 
discussed by representatives of the territorial administration, 
the Pacific Fleet and scientific circles at a conference here on 
Tuesday. Experts believe that the quality of Russian 
technologies with a guaranteed maintenance system will ensure 
complete radiational and ecological safety for the population. 
  The use of the energy potential of one submarine can meet 
the 
needs in heating and electricity of no less than 50 houses with 
many apartments.

<F P=106> [Report by Y. Shebalkin under "There Is Such a Service" </F>
rubric: "`Small Forces' for Radiation"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Recently, a vessel was 
detained in Kaliningrad trade port a few hours before departure. 
It turned out that the cargo of the motor ship "Composer 
Musorgskiy" was posing a radioactive danger. This means that 
the lives of the people working there were threatened to a 
certain extent. Moreover, exports of radioactive substances 
(uranium) without relative documentation are forbidden. 
Eventually, the motor ship was sent to the place of its 
destination -- St. Petersburg. 
  Here is another criminal fact. The Kaliningrad asphalt 
cement plant has devices which control the production of the 
mixture with sensors operating on radioisotopes. Some local 
dodgers kept an eye on those colorful "castings" and took the 
devices away despite the warning signs. The militia ran their 
feet off to find the culprits. Finally, the stolen devices were 
found. The thieves, most probably, had not found a customer, 
while someone must have stored, carried, and transported 
personal death for a long time. It is regrettable that the 
plant failed to ensure proper security for the radioactive 
devices. 
  Let us remember Chernobyl. We live thousands of kilometers 
away from the site of the tragedy, but we felt its effects. We 
will, probably, feel them for a long time. 
  That is why the Russian president issued a decree approving 
the resolution "On Federal Control Over Nuclear and Radioactive 
Security." This is a joint document of the president, the 
legislature, and the government. By the way, I will remind 
everyone that even Gorbachev tried to introduce such control 
back in 1985, because the former USSR is a member of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. Unfortunately, the project 
remained only a collection of good proposals for offices and 
officials. [passage omitted] Nevertheless, the key and supreme 
principle of control in any civilized country is its 
nondepartmental character, as well as responsibility before the 
coming generations. Until now, we have had administrative 
control -- from the Atomic Ministry and the Ministries of Atomic 
Energy, Construction, and Defense. No one washes one's dirty 
linen in public, as a rule. That is why the establishment of 
independent subunits in oblasts was an important event. 
  "The inspection supervises how organizations, enterprises, 
and military units of the garrison and the fleet observe the 
rules of storing and utilizing radioactive substances," says 
Dmitriy Gennadyevich Sorokin, chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast 
inspection. "Our staff is small, there are three more people 
besides me, while the work load is quite impressive. Dozens of 
enterprises in the oblast use devices with radioactive 
substances. Furthermore, there is a large number of military 
units where there is more equipment with radioisotopes than one 
knows what to do with them." 
  "There are several problems that hamper the activities of 
our 
inspection. As any budget organization, it is experiencing 
financial difficulties today. We have no means of transport or 
the necessary equipment for qualitative analysis of radioactive 
materials. In the case of the motor ship "Composer Musorgskiy," 
by the way, we failed to establish the exact effect of the 
"evil" cargo on the environment." [passage omitted] 
  "I will dwell on the discussion concerning the possible 
construction of a nuclear power plant in our oblast." 
  "The rate of construction of atomic power stations is 
increasing around the world. Incidentally, our neighbors are 
also building them. Lithuania is the leader in terms of energy 
production at a nuclear station. Poland has its own stations, 
while Belarus has ordered a project for itself from Canada." 
  "My opinion is likely to be viewed as subjective, but it is 
the assessment of a competent specialist. A nuclear power 
station is less polluting than any coal station, while the 
energy produced there is the cheapest. However, the issue of 
constructing an atomic station in our region is a matter for 
energy specialists." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Yevstafyev, chief of FIS arms </F>
control and proliferation department, by Vladimir Orlov: 
"Nuclear Redivision"; date and place not specified] 
  [Text] Russia may soon find itself encircled by nuclear 
states. There is a growing threat of local conflicts with the 
use of weapons of mass destruction on our southern flanks. This 
seemingly pessimistic prognosis is shared today by many military 
practicians. 
  Does the Russian leadership have information about real 
nuclear arsenals and programmes of "threshold" and 
"near-threshold" countries located on Russia's perimeter? This 
is the subject of an interview MN correspondent Vladimir Orlov 
had with Gennady Yevstafyev, head of the department of control 
over arms and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
of Russia's External Intelligence Service. 
  MOSCOW NEWS correspondent: Do you share concern 
about the "new nuclear encirclement of Russia?" 
  Gennady Yevstafyev: Only partially. Let me remind 
you that a conference for the prolongation of the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is scheduled to take place 
in 1995. I hope that it will be possible by that time to broaden 
by joint efforts the composition of the Treaty's participants 
and to prevent the appearance of new nuclear states, even in 
intermediary or temporary terms. But there still remain places 
in the world which give me cause for real worry... 
  Correspondent: Can you give examples? Name at 
least three of them, in the order of diminishing danger. 
  Gennady Yevstafyev: First, North Korea; second, 
Israel; third, India and Pakistan. 
  [Boxed item] 
<H5>  MOSCOW NEWS File </H5>
  According to the date of Western research centres 
Israel may possess nearly 200 nuclear warheads or material for 
their immediate manufacture; India has 60 nuclear warheads and 
Pakistan 15. North Korea is capable of manufacturing one or two 
nuclear bombs. Iran will be able to have nuclear weapons of its 
own after eight or ten years. 
  [end boxed item] 
  Correspondent: Let us consider North Korea. 
  Gennady Yevstafyev: We agree with the common 
conclusion of international experts. The leadership of North 
Korea has been trying for a long time to develop nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons. Delivery vehicles have also 
been developed successfully. One of the stages of this 
development were the recent tests of the improved Scud missile. 
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been actively 
pursuing an applied military programme in the nuclear sphere 
which is today, in the opinion of the External Intelligence 
Service, at an advanced state of development. 
  Correspondent: Why then has North Korea "frozen" 
its military nuclear programme? 
  Gennady Yevstafyev: There are two reasons. The 
first one is international pressure. The second is financial and 
technical difficulties within North Korea which is unable to 
carry the burden of the immense cost of the development of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  I know that it is understood in Washington that the DPRK 
[Democratic People's Republic of Korea] has not yet developed 
such weapons, and has not yet made real combat devices. Nor does 
Hans Blix, Director-General of the IAEA [International Atomic 
Energy Agency], believe that the DPRK has nuclear weapons. The 
External Intelligence Service also believes that the DPRK's 
nuclear programme is now in a frozen state and that in certain 
conditions the North Koreans are evidently prepared to stop it 
altogether and open it fully to inspection. Pyongyang's recent 
consent to have "gas-graphite" reactors replaced with 
light-water ones is a sign that the DPRK is ready to suspend 
part of its military programmes. 
  But there is one point which requires explanation. The fact 
that the DPRK decided to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty and sought to prevent control by IAEA inspectors has 
caused another knot to develop. Pyongyang has held up its 
withdrawal from the Treaty as a result of the dialogue between 
the DPRK and the United States and the monolithic position of 
the world community. But the interruption in IAEA control 
activity is not a point in favour of the North Korean leadership. 
  I would further like to note that the process of the 
transfer 
of power in the DPRK is still being completed. In these 
conditions everyone should display special caution and 
discretion in order not to fuel the situation which is already 
tense as it is. 
  The Americans display admirable firmness when they state to 
Pyongyang the view of the world community on the unacceptability 
of deviating from international treaties. At the same time it is 
no secret that the United States is fulfilling its own national 
foreign-policy interests in the region. The DPRK, on its part, 
plays for its own high stakes in its "nuclear dialogue" with the 
Americans. The conclusion follows that Russia, too, should 
proceed for its own interests in the matter of ensuring security 
in the Far East. 
  Correspondent: Israel is next on your list. It is 
no secret that it unofficially possesses nuclear weapons as well 
as advanced missile delivery vehicles... 
  Gennady Yevstafyev: Israelis themselves confirm 
this with pleasure in informal talks. Nuclear material of weapon 
purity is accumulated with the help of a heavy-water reactor and 
an installation for processing irradiated fuel (they are not 
controlled by IAEA). Their capacity is enough for manufacturing 
nuclear material for 5-10 warheads a year. A reactor of 26 
megawatt capacity was commissioned in 1963 with the help of 
France and was modernized during the 70's. After its capacity 
was increased to 75-150 megawatts the production of weapon 
plutonium could have grown from 7-8 to 50 kilogrammes a year. 
The installation for the processing of irradiated fuel was also 
built with the help of a French firm. It can produce 15-40 
kilogrammes of weapon plutonium a year. 
  In other words, Israel could have manufactured up to 20 
warheads during the 70's-80's and now may possess as many as 
200. These calculations can be corrected, of course, depending 
on the specific technical conditions. The high scientific and 
technological potential enables Israel to improve the designs of 
nuclear weapons, for instance, to develop small-size versions as 
well. 
  Correspondent: As far as I know Israel is now 
capable also of producing chemical weapons of all types, 
including nerve and blister agents and agents causing temporary 
disability... 
  Gennady Yevstafyev: Yes, Israel has highly 
developed chemical and petrochemical industries, qualified 
specialists and stocks of raw materials. Frankly speaking, this 
greatly complicates international processes of disarmament as a 
whole. In particular, Arab states have not signed the convention 
prohibiting chemical weapons and will evidently not sign it 
until Israel's position in the military-nuclear sphere clarifies. 
  Correspondent: The third place mentioned by you is 
Hindustan. 
  Gennady Yevstafyev: Let us begin with India. I 
would assess its technological possibilities as being very high. 
Though Pakistan's technical possibilities are somewhat lower 
they are also quite high. Besides that, Pakistan has good 
sources of financing, including foreign ones. About a year ago 
the External Intelligence Service prepared an open report where 
it pointed to Pakistan's possession of a nuclear potential. 
  Correspondent: But nuclear weapons are not the 
whole issue. There is also the problem of the proliferation of 
missile technologies. 
  Gennady Yevstafyev: The use of missile arms is 
evidently an inseparable part of strategic and operational plans 
in some countries. Among states which have made the greatest 
progress in this direction are (besides industrially advanced 
countries) Israel, Iran, Syria, India, Pakistan, the DPRK and 
Brazil. 
  It is well known that there are legal loopholes that pave 
the 
way for acquisition by Third World countries of necessary 
technical experience and technologies, such as the fulfilment of 
subcontracts of Western aerospace firms, the purchase of their 
shares, the setting up of joint or front companies, invitation 
of foreign specialists, the training of probationers, etc. Add 
to this the growth of industrial espionage. Incidentally the 
special commission of the UN Security Council on Iraq revealed 
the immense role which Western firms played illegally (or with 
the blessing of their governments?) in the development of Iraq's 
ramified missile complex. 
  But it is impermissible to deprive some countries of access 
to peaceful technologies on the pretext of strengthening control 
over missile technologies. Specialists (including those in the 
External Intelligence Service) keep a careful watch over Iran's 
missile intentions, including the direction of its purchases and 
its interest in technologies. But the talk about "Iran's 
strengthening" and "danger emanating from it" sometimes 
camouflages the striving to deprive that country of access to 
modern technologies for purposes of development of its peaceful 
industrial potential. 
  Correspondent: The open report of the External 
Intelligence Service published in 1993 says that about 100 
countries now have an industrial base for making chemical 
weapons. 
  Gennady Yevstafyev: While the situation with 
nuclear weapons can be controlled (through combination of space 
facilities with operational information), this is very difficult 
to do where chemical weapons are concerned. It is believed that 
the real requirement of chemical weapons amounts to only 100-200 
tons even in a major and prolonged regional conflict. The stocks 
of chemical weapons are in practice greater than these figures. 
But it is practically impossible to detect 100 and even 500 tons 
of hidden chemical weapons. Chemical compounds and agents can be 
kept in containers smaller than an ordinary barrel. 
<H5>  MOSCOW NEWS Commentary </H5>
  It may be presumed that the highly placed Russian 
intelligence officer has made public only part of the data at 
his disposal. But the accents made by Gennady Yevstafyev show 
that the world will soon face a new military-political situation. 
  This was ultimately the factor in Russia's official decision 
in Nov '93 to reject the thesis of being the first not to use 
nuclear weapons. The basic points of the military doctrine do 
not preclude the use of nuclear weapons against states which 
have not joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty. What is more, 
cases have been stipulated when Russia can use nuclear weapons 
even against non-nuclear participants in the Treaty. In the 
words of Valery Manilov, Deputy Secretary of Russia's Security 
Council, this approach was a result of "painful revision" of 
Russia's nuclear policy "at the highest level: each member of 
the Security Council has expressed his view on this matter." 
  The members of Russia's Security Council believe that 
nuclear 
weapons are above all an important political factor for Russia. 
"Having taken into account the growing number of countries which 
conceal their nuclear weapons, Russia has reconsidered its 
former approach," stated Valery Manilov. 
  Thus Russia's new nuclear concept is one of nuclear 
deterrence. It looks like the military-political leadership of 
Russia is increasingly less worried about the nuclear arsenals 
of the United States. It is new nuclear countries that become 
the subject of its closest attention.

  [Text] The removal of nuclear fuel from former Soviet 
submarine training base Paldiski in north west Estonia and its 
transport to Russia is expected to be carried out as planned and 
the work will be done in the spring and summer of 1994, Antti 
Vuorinen, head of the nuclear and radiation safety group of the 
Council of the Baltic Sea countries, told a news conference on 
Friday. 
  Dismantling of the training reactors depends on the essence 
of an agreement Estonia and Russia are to conclude this spring, 
Vuorinen said. 
  Problems might still spring up, Mark Sinisoo, the adviser to 
the Estonian Foreign Ministry, told the news conference. Russia 
wants to transport the fuel in containers TK 18 never used for 
that purpose before. This requires previous testing and a 
consent by GozAtomNadzor. Besides, Russia has no specific plans 
for the deposition of the nuclear waste, Sinisoo added. There 
is only a list of priorities which has to be approved by the 
Russian government.

  [Text] Almaty February 12 TASS -- An IZVESTIYA newspaper 
report saying "Kazakh nuclear storages are on the verge of an 
accident" was estimated as "not corresponding to the reality" 
today by Kazakh state adviser Tulegen Zhukeyev. 
  Zhukeyev told a news conference in Almaty the report was 
"instigated by forces wishing to introduce additional 
difficulties in the beginning bilateral negotiations on nuclear 
arms and a search for mutually acceptable decisions on an equal 
basis." [sentence as received] 
  "It seems the forces are dissatisfied with the Kazakh 
suspension of withdrawal of intercontinental ballistic missiles 
that has begun on Kazakh goodwill. A total of 12 missiles have 
been withdrawn. Now the work is stopped because of the unsettled 
problem of compensation for highly-enriched uranium half of 
which was extracted in Kazakhstan," said the official. 
  The report was published on the eve of a U.S. visit of 
Kazakh 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev. This gives grounds to say the 
certain forces hope for a possibility of additional 
international pressure on Kazakhstan in the sphere of nuclear 
arms. "However, the problem can be settled only through 
civilized negotiations with due account of interests of all 
sides. Kazakhstan will not abandon its sovereign rights and 
interests," said Zhukeyev. 
  The Kazakh stand was taken with understanding by Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev during his recent stay in Almaty. 
  As for the IZVESTIYA's concern over the danger-prone 
situation in nuclear arms storage allegedly created through the 
fault of Kazakhstan, the state adviser said "nuclear arms are 
completely safe and well-controlled. Kazakhstan has never 
hampered the delivery of spares, instruments and equipment for 
repairs and warranty service of nuclear warheads in contrast to 
the report's claims. It is also not interested in deteriorated 
position of Russian servicemen". 
  "We have repeatedly offered the Russian side to begin 
negotiations and settle all problems on a mutually acceptable 
basis. Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko timely responded to a 
letter of his Russian counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin on the 
problem," stressed Zhukeyev. In his words, "the sides can 
achieve progress on the issue only with due account of their 
interests".

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Nuclear Magazines in Kazakhstan </F>
Are on the Verge of an Accident"] 
  [Text] While Kiev and Moscow are reaching agreement on the 
fate of the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, a critical situation has 
taken shape in the nuclear magazines located on the territory of 
Kazakhstan. IZVESTIYA has been told this by informed sources at 
the Russian Ministry of Defense. 
  As is known, 104 SS-18 missiles -- the heaviest in the world 
-- each with 10 nuclear warheads, and also Tu-95MS strategic 
bombers with 240 cruise missiles with a nuclear payload are 
stationed in that state. The situation on the nuclear technical 
bases where these specialized munitions are stored is becoming 
threatening. Particularly in the garrisons at Derzhavinsk in 
Turgay Oblast and at Zhangiz-Tobe in Semipalatinsk Oblast, where 
two missile divisions are stationed. 
  The number of nuclear munitions laid in store there is more 
than twice the permissible norms. The fire alarm system, the 
fire extinguishing equipment, and the electric wiring are 
literally on their last legs and virtually do not work. If, God 
forbid, some untoward situation were to arise, it would be 
problematic to get the nuclear warheads out of the building and 
also to extinguish the flames -- the consequences do not bear 
thinking about. Things are no better in the shop in which 
operational checks on the reentry vehicles of strategic missiles 
are carried out. For several months now it has been in a 
precarious [avariynyy] state. The end wall has come away from 
the building, and if it collapses it will bury beneath itself 
both nuclear warheads and people. 
  I was told that there is no heating or water in the special 
premises of the missile technical bases. The technical 
contrivances for guarding these bases, the engineered structures 
-- or more accurately, the wire entanglements -- and the 
protection device along which high-tension current passes have 
been disconnected from the power supply network, and the mine 
fields and signal rockets are not activated when the perimeters 
of the guarded sectors are violated by wild animals and people. 
The guard subunits are not fully manned, and their training is 
at such a low level that you can only be amazed that no one has 
yet stolen a single atom bomb. Maybe this is only because it is 
so cold now in the steppes of Northern Kazakhstan and criminals 
do not feel like going after nuclear secrets. 
  There is, in principle, just one reason for all these 
disgraceful things, which specialists call by the abstruse term 
"gross violation of the explosion-and-fire-safety requirements" 
-- the lack of an interstate agreement between Russia and 
Kazakhstan on the status of, and on the future fate of, the 
missile technical bases and the strategic missile troops 
stationed on the state's territory. 
  Although Almaty does not consider itself the owner of these 
specific weapons and has announced that the state has subscribed 
to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a 
country which does not possess them, according to information 
from the same source, its officials prohibit the Russian 
military from taking them outside the republic to manufacturing 
plants and, moreover, do not permit the delivery to the 
garrisons of the necessary spare parts and tools or the 
equipment for carrying out repair work or the warranty servicing 
of nuclear munitions. 
  The national bank of Kazakhstan does not have a ruble 
account 
to which Russia could transfer money to pay for the labor of its 
officers and ensigns or allocate funds for electricity or to 
ensure the garrisons' vital activity. 
  Owing to chronic nonpayments, the missilemen regularly have 
their electricity cut off, and this, so specialists say, could 
result in the unpredictable behavior of the entire nuclear 
missile complex. 
  "Things have reached the point," one of the officers who 
have 
arrived from Kazakhstan told me, "where our pay is smuggled over 
the border to us." 
  But there is nothing to buy in the garrison stores even with 
the money that the officers do get -- they are completely empty. 
The mood among officers could not be worse. Virtually over 
half the nuclear specialists with top qualifications do not wish 
to sign contracts for military service here. Deserters have 
even appeared among officers, and 14 recent graduates of higher 
military schools went absent without leave from one of the 
divisions and have not turned up for service for several months 
now. Four of them are specialists on nuclear warheads. 
  According to the information which the editorial office has, 
repeated requests from the leadership of the Russian Ministry of 
Defense to Kazakhstani Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko to 
help to organize the normal functioning of the nuclear missile 
installations located in the country have not produced any 
results. Written requests have not even been answered. Maybe 
the visit to Almaty of Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will get 
something moving. But the military is afraid that this process 
might drag on indefinitely. Nuclear weapons cannot wait 
endlessly.

<F P=106> ["rzi"-attributed report: "New Rumors About Cessna </F>
Passengers"] 
  [Text] It seems that several intelligence agents of former 
East Bloc states were involved in the events, which ended, for 
the time being, on the evening of 24 January with the crash of a 
Cessna 425 private plane into Lake Constance, a crash which has 
led to many speculations. This is shown by files of the Latvian 
Public Prosecutor's Office, to which the Riga daily DIENA was 
able to gain access. According to latest findings by the 
Stuttgart Land Office of Criminal Investigations, in addition to 
pilot Rudolf Wirschen and the two Czechs, Iveta Ranetova and 
Alena Petrusova, Berlin building entrepreneur Josef Rimmele and 
his partner Klaus Eichler were aboard the plane. The latter two 
tried to make a deal with allegedly radioactive materials in the 
Latvian capital of Riga last autumn. 
<H5>  Murky Water, Murky Figures </H5>
  According to the files of the Latvian investigators, Rimmele 
and Eichler were high-ranking former employees of the GDR 
[German Democratic Republic] State Security Service; another 
wire puller of the deal and mediator of murky business contacts 
in the east, Klaus-Peter Nedwig, served as a lieutenant colonel 
in the GDR People's Police in the past. The interpreter for the 
Germans was Pawel Minarchik, formerly captain of the 
Czechoslovak intelligence service, who had infiltrated Radio 
Free Europe as an employee during the years of the Cold War and 
was later sentenced to a prison term for trying to blow up the 
radio station. 
  According to the files of the Riga Public Prosecutor's 
Office, in spring 1993 Rimmele and Eichler met in Prague with 
Alexander Korisno, the owner of the Marketing Service company, 
which is registered in Latvia. Already at that time, they spoke 
of a deal with "rare metals." On 24 October 1993, Rimmele, 
Eichler, Ranetova, Petrusova, as well as Minarchik arrived in 
Riga. There, in the office of the Dimassko company in Valdemara 
Street 161, the men met with the so-far unknown sellers of 66 kg 
of rubidium and 6 kg cesium 133 (both metals are not 
radioactive). According to findings by the Latvian public 
prosecutor's office, at that time the goods were in the bonded 
warehouse at Zurich Kloten airport at the disposal of a company 
owned by Rimmele. The purpose of the trip to Riga reportedly 
was to settle payment modalities -- $2 million in cash were 
demanded. However, the fact that the two buyers had not yet 
found a customer for the allegedly "hot goods" and thus were not 
able to pay seems to have met with little understanding by the 
sellers, according to the files of the Latvian investigators. 
<H5>  In the Hands of the Mafia </H5>
  The further course of the events reportedly was as follows: 
When Rimmele, Eichler, and Minarchik left the office, they were 
attacked in front of the door by six to eight masked men, who 
pushed them into a small bus, threatening to use their weapons. 
The bus took them to a hiding place in a private building in 
Saremas Street 8. There the kidnappers demanded money. The 
above-mentioned address is well known to the local police: The 
building used to belong to Viktors Balulis, a gangster with a 
long police record, who had fled from the authorities and gone 
abroad. 
  According to the findings by the Latvian investigators, 
Rimmele and Minarchik were released soon afterwards, while 
Eichler--tied with hand-cuffs to a heater -- remained in the 
basement of the building in Saremas Street. Minarchik and the 
two women were emphatically told not to leave Riga, while 
Rimmele flew back to Germany -- probably to get money. On 27 
October, he turned to the German Embassy in Riga, reporting that 
Eichler had been kidnapped the day before. However, Latvian 
Interior Minister Kristovskis was told by the Embassy about this 
matter as late as on 3 November. 
<H5>  Goods From Moscow </H5>
  When Rimmele returned to Riga on 10 November, Korisno, the 
above- mentioned owner of the Marketing Service company, 
demanded not only $2.2 million as payment for the goods, but 
another $17,000 for himself as a bonus. On the same day he was 
arrested by the police. During the subsequent interrogation, 
Korisno admitted to talks with Rimmele and Eichler about the 
purchase of "rare metals" and to several meetings with the two 
in Riga, but he claimed that he did not now where Eichler was. 
On 20 November, Eichler managed to flee despite the fact that 
he was constantly watched. He immediately reported to the 
police and told them about the background of the kidnapping. 
  According to the current findings of the Riga Public 
Prosecutor's Office, the "rare metals" probably reached 
Switzerland from Latvia without any detours; only the juridical 
and financial part of the transaction took place in the Baltic 
republic. Clues point to a scientific production facility in 
Moscow as the actual seller. So far, the Latvian public 
prosecutor has issued indictments against five persons only for 
kidnapping.

  [Text] Riga, February 11, LETA -- The daily DIENA reported 
about certain aspects of the mysterious case involving the 
purchase of alkali metals and a plane-crash over the Bodensee in 
Germany. Initial reports of the German press claimed that the 
plane might contain radioactive materials bought in Riga. 
However, when the plane had been recovered neither bodies nor 
metals were found in it. Ilgvars Samins, a top official of the 
Latvian Prosecutors Office, said that by now there were no 
grounds to allege that the missing persons had bought rubidium 
and cesium in Riga. It is more likely that the metals have come 
from the East. 
  I. Ruemmele and K. Eichler, whose names appear in materials 
of the Latvian Prosecutors Office and German press, are the 
former employees of the East Germany's intelligence service 
while Pavel Minarzik, said to be an interpreter, actually was a 
former captain of the Czechoslovakia's secret service. For many 
years he had been working for the radio station "Free Europe" 
but later was convicted for the attempt to blow up the same 
radio station. Minarzik also was the author of the book titled 
"The Come-back of a Secret Service Man". 
  The name of a certain Klaus Peter Nedvig, the former colonel 
of Berlin Criminal Police, could also be found in the 
prosecutors files. On October 24 they were in Riga, negotiating 
a purchase of 66 kilograms of rubidium and 6 kilograms of 
cesium-133 for a price of $2 million. Meantime the subject of 
the deal was stored at the airport of a Swiss town. The talks in 
Riga focused on the term of payment which the foreigners asked 
to postpone as the final customer for the metals had yet not 
been found. 
  Following the talks at the office the guests were rounded up 
by 6-8 masked and armed men. They were pushed into a minibus and 
whisked to a cottage on the outskirts of the city where the 
demands for money were put up to the victims. Eichler was left 
hand-cuffed to a radiator, but the rest of the captives were 
freed soon and given "advice" to leave Riga. After 10 days 
Eichler managed to escape. The mediator of the deal, a Riga 
resident named A. Korizno, who apart from $2.2 million demanded 
extra $17,000 for his services, was arrested. The Latvian 
Prosecutors Office said that in Riga only laundering of money 
took place, therefore at present the case have been filed only 
for taking hostages.

  [Text] Vienna, March l0 (AFP) -- Differences of 
interpretation over an agreement on inspection of nuclear sites 
have arisen between North Korea and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], sources said here Thursday. 
  They were commenting on a disclosure by a U.S. State 
Department official in Washington that "difficulties" were being 
experienced by agency inspectors who went to North Korea a week 
ago to vet seven declared facilities. 
  They are trying to determine whether North Korea has 
diverted 
plutonium from its Yongbyon reactor since the IAEA's last full 
inspection in February last year. 
  Agency spokesman David Kyd refused however to go into detail 
about the reported difficulties. The inspection was continuing, 
with some tasks accomplished and others still to be carried out, 
he said. The team hoped to wind up the mission as scheduled by 
next Tuesday, and there was no plan to recall the inspectors any 
earlier. 
  "It is half-time now and there is no use in speculating how 
the game will end," Kyd remarked.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Lashkevich report: "Lithuania Is Unable To Stop </F>
Nuclear Smuggling"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- Lithuania cannot ensure complete control 
over the transportation of nuclear and radiative materials 
across its territory since it does not possess the necessary 
equipment that would make it possible to detect nuclear fuel 
being conveyed over the border. 
  Povilas Vaisnis, chief of the State Inspectorate for Nuclear 
Energy Safety, has indirectly confirmed the persistent rumors of 
Lithuania as a transit country for nuclear radiation. He did 
not refute or confirm the opinion of the German police that 
Vilnius and Kaunas are centers of nuclear smuggling, although 
the two largest Lithuanian cities can hardly aspire to such an 
"honorary" title. There is no doubt that, following the breakup 
of the USSR, Lithuania became a kind of transshipment base for 
various firms, groups, and clans engaged in transporting and 
selling dangerous freight to the West. 
  But what of Lithuania itself, which, thanks to the presence 
of the Ignalina Nuclear Electric Power Station [AES] on its 
territory, possesses nuclear fuel and materials? Is it not the 
source of the nuclear exports? Lithuanian nuclear specialists 
unanimously deny this. Povilas Vaisnis believes that, despite 
the lack of juridical regulation of the control and accounting 
system at the Ignalina AES, nuclear fuel is kept under reliable 
guard in special storehouses. And yet the optimism is clearly 
exaggerated. Everybody remembers last year's sensational 
business when a nuclear fuel cassette went missing from the 
Ignalina AES and has still not been found. AES engineers 
estimate that one such cassette containing fuel is worth 
approximately $60,000 on the world market. 
  If it had not been for stocktaking, even now nobody would 
have learned of the disappearance of that cassette. The 
investigative group never arrived at an unequivocal conclusion 
-- had it been removed from the territory of the AES, or had it 
simply "gotten lost" in the maze of nuclear bookkeeping? 
  Lithuania signed the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons and pledged to keep nuclear materials safe. A 
special inspectorate is also keeping a careful eye on this. A 
significant leak of nuclear fuel or radioactive waste is ruled 
out here. But the transportation of nuclear materials across 
Lithuania is something really real. 
  "We are trying to close the route for the export of nuclear 
fuel," Povilas Vaisnis said, "but it is difficult for us. Not 
only do we not have the necessary equipment and apparatus, we 
also don't have specialists in the border and customs services 
or such work skills in exposing smuggling." 
  Incidentally, local smugglers, for whom nuclear transit is a 
reliable means of making a fast buck, are perfectly well aware 
of these difficulties. Many have maintained links with the 
Russian market, and people in the know maintain that things go 
on at a very high level. 
  Entry to this sphere of business is prohibited to ordinary 
businessmen engaged, for example, in the "copper business" or 
unscrewing nuts from railroad tracks. As a rule, failures and 
unpleasantness await those who attempt to engage in amateur 
activities. This, for example, was what happened to one R. 
Urbonas, a resident of Panevezys, who decided to make money out 
of selling several kilograms of uranium conveyed from beyond the 
Urals. He was caught and arrested by the police but, when asked 
where the uranium was, he replied that he had thrown it into the 
Nevezis River. At the insistence of the city's residents the 
frightened police dug up the whole riverbed but never found 
anything. Either the nuclear businessman had managed to sell 
the uranium in time, or the police failed to display sufficient 
zeal. 
  Genuine nuclear slick operators do everything legally. They 
fall victim only to unforeseen circumstances. A graphic example 
is provided by the matter of a load of beryllium in containers 
given to the Lithuanian Joint-Stock Innovation Bank in Vilnius 
to store. The police stumbled across it by chance when checking 
a telephone report that a bomb had been planted. It is, 
however, possible that the call, far from being accidental, was 
a ploy [navodka] by rivals for the dangerous freight. It is 
curious that, according to documents, there was no contraband: 
The freight weighing four tonnes and worth approximately $123 
million had a certificate, an official import permit to 
Lithuania, a customs note....

  [Text] Ukrainian President Kravchuk received today (Percy 
Barnevick), chief executive officer of ABB, a multinational 
concern. (Mr. Barnevick) came to Ukraine for the first time. 
The purpose of his visit is to expand cooperation with our 
country, first of all in the sphere of nuclear engineering. 
This cooperation was initiated last year, during President 
Kravchuk's visit to Switzerland. What can it bring for us? 
President Kravchuk and Mr. Barnevick talked about this with the 
journalists after their meeting. 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] After we signed the tripartite 
agreement and the Supreme Council ratified START I and Article 5 
of the Lisbon Protocol, the world's attitude toward Ukraine 
changed for the better. Last week, I had a telephone 
conversations with Bill Clinton, Mitterand, Kohl; and all of 
them, with no exception [words indistinct] heads of the state 
and governments said that the question is not whether assistance 
should be extended, but that it should be applied to specific 
programs. So, the task is to come up with specific programs. 
All those conversations had a common point: Our countries are 
ready to give you aid, but it is up to you to support your 
programs regarding their technical, technological, or legal 
aspects, and then submit them to those countries and the World 
Bank. So, ABB has a priority in this area, because we have been 
working with this concern for more than a year. I met with its 
president in Zurich last year in Switzerland. Since that time, 
we have been concentrating on the problems facing Ukraine. The 
concern has concrete proposals. They also include establishing 
an investment fund in nuclear engineering, and the Ukrainian 
engineering in general. The issue of hard currency investments 
is very important for us. Thus, the task of freeing Ukraine 
from dependency on energy is a leading priority. Another 
priority is agriculture. One should act very quickly here, but 
equipped with programs so that we could see things in 
perspective. To sum it up, I would like to say that such a 
powerful company as ABB can do very much for Ukraine. Following 
today's meeting, I am convinced that specific plans, programs, 
and intentions are on hand. [end recording] 
  [Ukrainian translation of Barnevick's words] I think that 
improvement of reliability at nuclear power plants is one of the 
prime tasks, because nuclear plants will help reduce dependency 
on oil and natural gas. This was the topic of our conversation 
with the Ukrainian president. We were discussing not only the 
technical side of this issue, but also the possibility of 
creating a special investment fund. We have some experience 
acquired by the first joint venture. Now, we are considering 
setting up several more similar ventures in Ukraine. Ukraine is 
one of the countries where we could do a lot.

<F P=106> [Report by Athanasios Dhrougos] </F>
  [Excerpts] Turkey's secret nuclear program is a threat to 
Greece. According to extremely confidential APOYEVMATINI 
information, YEETHA [National Defense General Staff] military 
officials have been particularly concerned. 
  According to these reports, "heading toward the year 2000 
and 
facing a chaotic situation in the Balkans, Turkey in the next 
three or four years will be well along the path of developing 
nuclear forces, something that will make it particularly 
respected in the part of the world stretching from the Adriatic 
to Kazakhstan." 
  A nuclear program that aims to construct a nuclear bomb is 
under way. This program will be added to Ankara's already 
fast-developing arms programs for the Air Force and Navy. The 
same confidential analysis of Turkey's nuclear activities 
stresses that in the new geopolitical environment that followed 
the dissolution of the Soviet nuclear arsenal; Ukraine's 
acquisition of nuclear weapons; and the general instability in 
the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East, Turkey must 
prevent incidents from happening because the threat of small 
regional wars with nuclear weapons, such as between Pakistan and 
India, cannot be ruled out. [passage omitted] 
  To a great extent, Turkey satisfies the basic prerequisites 
for a nuclear country. It has uranium supplies and is strong in 
the sciences. If its cooperation with Pakistan, Argentina, and 
China proceeds, the Turkish nuclear bomb will become a reality. 
At the same time, Ankara is trying to exploit instability in 
the Middle East as well as the ambitions of many states in the 
area, such as Libya and Iran, for weapons of mass destruction 
(nuclear-chemical) by claiming that Iran or Iraq will threaten 
it in the future. Therefore, because of changes in NATO 
policies, it must have a nuclear bomb. [passage omitted] 
  Ankara is trying to acquire nuclear weapons from the former 
Soviet Union's full and diverse arsenal but is concerned with 
U.S. and European reaction. All those unemployed scientists 
have been hired to various "special groups" on a yearly basis 
for $2,300 per month. Their contracts may be renewed. 
Scientists from Kazakhstan who are experts on nuclear weapons 
teach at Istanbul University. [passage omitted] 
  The cost of making nuclear weapons is believed to be great 
but Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and her staff are 
concerned with the new world that is being created. They attach 
particular importance to the country's nuclear infrastructure, 
which is now making progress and will show results in three or 
four years. 
  APOYEVMATINI knows that Turkey's nuclear program concerns 
the 
Greek military. It is a fact that in the next few years, 
Turkey's threat to Greece will include a nuclear element. Our 
side must adopt a strategy that will analyze in depth future 
threats, mainly by Turkey's many arms programs.

<F P=106> [Article by Admiral Marcel Duval, former chairman of our the </F>
National Defense Studies Committee and director of DEFENSE 
NATIONALE: "What Future for the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation 
Treaty?"] 
  [Exerpts] The Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which covers a 
25-year period, will expire in 1995. Negotiations will then be 
needed to set the terms for its renewal. Admiral Marcel Duvan 
was kind enough to carry out an analysis of nonproliferation, of 
the treaty, of the concerns of different nuclear and nonnuclear 
states, and finally of the prospects for the future, 
particularly for our country. We are most grateful to him for 
this very complete study. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Future Prospects </H5>
  Having taken stock of nonproliferation, the term hitherto 
used to describe the totality of measures to prevent the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, let us now examine 
its future prospects on the eve of its expiry in 1995. As for 
the NPT itself, its indefinite renewal, which naturally is 
desired by the nuclear powers, would require an affirmative vote 
by 83 countries, since it is estimated that 165 countries will 
then be party to it. As the general assumption is that 45 
positive votes are guaranteed, those of at least 38 developing 
countries will also have to be secured. The Conference of 
Nonaligned States, which met in 1992, set the following 
conditions for extending the treaty: the cessation of nuclear 
tests; an end to the production of nuclear weapons; 
implementation of the START treaties; and the total elimination 
of these weapons by a given deadline. Furthermore, during the 
conference to prepare the revision of the NPT, which took place 
in May 1993, it appeared that many nonnuclear states, not all of 
which were nonaligned states, will oppose indefinite extension 
and may even propose a two-year trial period, at the end of 
which their demands would have to be implemented through 
international treaties. 
  We have seen that the United States has now decided to meet 
most of these demands by proposing the conclusion of a treaty 
totally banning nuclear tests, and of another prohibiting the 
production of fissile materials for explosive use. For its 
part, the United States has already declared a moratorium on its 
tests until 1995, and stopped its production of fissile 
materials, while also accepting international monitoring of its 
stocks. In addition, it has ceased modernization of its nuclear 
arsenal, since, for the first time for 50 years, it is no longer 
running a nuclear program now that it has ceased further work on 
its mobile strategic missile, and it canceled both its light 
strategic missile program and its programs for new nuclear 
warheads for its Trident submarine missiles and for new nuclear 
missiles for its B2 bombers. It has also undertaken the 
dismantling required by the START treaties, even though these 
have not yet been ratified by the other parties. In the face of 
this voluntary disarmament, some have wondered, analyzing 
statements by Americans in senior positions, whether this did 
not amount to a delegitimization by the United States of nuclear 
weapons so as to derive maximum advantage from its undisputed 
conventional superiority over any possible adversaries anywhere 
in the world. 
  Nevertheless, problems may still arise with other 
protagonists involved in the renewal of the NPT and the adoption 
of any other planned nonproliferation agreements linked to it. 
First, take the chaotic situation in the former Soviet Union, 
which particularly raises, as has been seen, the problem of 
Ukraine's adherence to the NPT. There will then remain the task 
of dismantling those nuclear weapons affected by the START 
treaty, which will take over 10 years and will require 
considerable financial assistance, not to mention the 
difficulties arising from the international monitoring of its 
implementation. To these concerns we should add, mindful of the 
Chernobyl catastrophe, those over the safety of nuclear plants 
for peaceful purposes and over the possibility of subjecting 
these plants to the controls which will inevitably be required 
by a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for 
weapons use. Finally, it is obvious that the degree to which all 
these proposals are welcomed in 1995 will be primarily 
influenced by the actions taken before this expiry by China, the 
most "proliferating" state whose actions frequently differ from 
its statements and which has the right of veto. It will also 
depend on the behavior of the undeclared nuclear powers. In 
other words, it will depend on Iraq's respect for its commitment 
to accepting long-term monitoring of its disarmament; on the 
outcome of the present confrontation over monitoring North 
Korea's installations; regarding Israel and Iran, on the peace 
process presently under way in the Middle East; while it may be 
hoped that the mutual deterrence between India and Pakistan will 
prevent their dispute over Kashmir from degenerating into open 
war. History teaches us that disarmament of all kinds is far 
more often a consequence of peace than the necessary 
prerequisite for it. This means that the struggle to prevent 
proliferation is undoubtedly far more of a political process, 
particularly at a regional level, than a matter of preventive 
technocratic measures. This does not imply that the latter have 
no effect, even if it is only to do everything possible to avoid 
the use of nuclear weapons in haste or in error, since, once the 
"nuclear taboo" has been breached, they have failed in their 
peace-keeping purpose. 
<H5>  Consequences for France </H5>
  We now have to consider the consequences of all the above 
for 
France, which for the past 35 years has based its defense policy 
on the peace-keeping effect of nuclear weapons, and has largely 
based its foreign policy on the independence of its deterrent. 
Thus, the "French exception" in this area will be particularly 
challenged by the nonproliferation measures to be submitted in 
1995 to the international community. 
  Of these, the major concern is obviously the total cessation 
of nuclear tests, since this not only poses both for ourselves 
and for others a threat to the safety of existing weapons, but 
would also prevent us from developing new programs, even though 
we presently have at least one major one under way, the M5, 
which, by considerably increasing both range and performance, is 
intended to give our "new generation" of nuclear-missile 
launching submarines (SNLE) "all-out" capabilities. To this 
technological constraint is added the psychological, and hence 
political one, which is bound to challenge the two super powers' 
previously-announced renunciation of mobile strategic missiles 
and multiple warheads, and of terrestrial and naval tactical 
nuclear weapons. In contrast, the cessation of production of 
fissile materials for explosive use would not appear to have any 
major consequences for our defense, at least over the medium 
term. 
  The increase in "denuclearized zones" would also seriously 
limit the freedom of action of our nuclear submarines, as they 
presently carry almost 90 percent of our nuclear deterrent 
capability. If this process were to extend to Europe, following 
the apparently conceivable withdrawal of U.S. airborne nuclear 
capacity still deployed there, then this would put an end to the 
possibility of eventually establishing a European deterrent. 
For this reason, and also to finally frame a common policy in 
this matter, it would be desirable to discuss all these 
nonproliferation measures within the European Union, or, failing 
this, on a Franco-British basis, as allowed by the recent 
establishment of a "Joint Commission on Nuclear Policy and 
Doctrine." At the national level, it would also appear 
desirable to reactivate the "Council on Exterior Nuclear 
Relations," set up in 1976 to respond to the concerns then 
beginning to be aroused here by proliferation. 
  The survival of our national deterrent, together with the 
need to consider establishing such a deterrent at the European 
level, must be justified in terms of the effectiveness to be 
expected of them in the face of threats which can be foreseen 
over a fairly long term. In this respect, the threat emanating 
from the still considerable nuclear arsenals located in the 
territory of the former Soviet Union has in no way disappeared, 
however unlikely any aggression by them appears at present. The 
greatest danger is probably that of the possibility of these 
nuclear weapons falling into the hands of groups of varying 
degrees of responsibility, for whom the exercise of our 
deterrent, backed up by the threat of massive reprisals, would 
run the risk both of being unacceptable to international public 
opinion, and of being ineffective. The same would apply, we 
believe, to any "troublemaker" located outside Europe who, armed 
with a few primitive weapons and suitable ballistic vehicles, 
would hide in some kind of "aggressive sanctuary," or even 
perpetrated nuclear blackmail. 
  In the face of such possible threats, two schools of thought 
are taking shape here. The first holds to the above doctrine, 
restricting it to the instance of major aggression, actually 
directed against our national territory, for which it feels the 
present arsenal is adequate. The second considers there is a 
need for a limited "nuclear counterthreat," capable of 
deployment overseas and intended to "inhibit" the destructive 
capacity of a terrorist state, and if need be to "decapitate" 
it. This would require, in the view of this school, very 
accurate mobile weapons with reduced collateral effects, with 
adjustable power, and the capability to penetrate the ground, 
and would thus mean new programs, and hence the need to carry 
out tests. In contrast, a rapprochement seems to be emerging 
between the two schools over the possible benefits, in the face 
of these new threats, in possessing a system based on ballistic 
theater antimissiles, or in other words a mobile system, even 
though during the Cold War France was opposed to any global 
system. Some consider that the disadvantage of establishing 
such a system is that it could give the "South" the impression 
that it is about to replace the "East" as the Western world's 
enemy. 
  The expiry in 1995 will therefore force us to formulate a 
view on all these matters. As for doctrines, we do not feel it 
is desirable to specify too closely the future conditions in 
which our nuclear deterrent could be used, or particularly to 
say what will not be done, so as to keep all our options open. 
It appears obvious that this deterrent will not be able to 
remain the absolute priority it was during the Cold War; but, as 
is amply proved by the present debates over nonproliferation and 
also those over the future course of the Security Council, it 
will certainly retain its political dimension. As it is no 
longer possible to "disinvent" the nuclear weapon, France must 
protect itself from its human know-how and its technical 
capabilities in this area, as these are largely what will ensure 
its future status as a "major medium power," and, if necessary, 
its survival if it were to be the object of any major aggression.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 16 (AFP) -- France's conventional forces 
will have a new role independent of nuclear weapons under a 
defence white paper being prepared by the government, officials 
said Wednesday. 
  A meeting of the country's defence council attended by 
President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, 
other top ministers and senior officers was set to approve the 
white paper later Wednesday [16 February]. 
  Since German reunification, France has carried out partial 
nuclear disarmament, reorganised its command structure and 
reduced its troop numbers. 
  The purpose of the white paper was to define post-Cold War 
strategy for the next 20 years, the officials said. 
  Up until the collapse of the Soviet Union, French strategy 
was founded on a single scenario -- a massive French 
conventional engagement alongside NATO allies in Central Europe, 
most likely in former Czechoslovakia. 
  The white paper sets out six scenarios for the commitment of 
French forces, the officials said, starting with "major 
conflict", implying use of nuclear weapons. 
  Others range through use of force to protect sovereignty of 
overseas posessions and the French sphere of influence in Africa 
and French action in a regional conflict developing from the 
breakup of the Soviet Union. 
  The white paper also states the need for French forces to be 
capable of sustaining long-term and distant operations, as in 
peace- keeping in Yugoslavia and Cambodia, and as in the Gulf 
war. 
  Mitterrand resisted pressure for change in nuclear strategy, 
informed sources said, and his views prevailed. 
  Sections of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) 
lobbied 
for a resumption of nuclear testing in order to develop small 
warheads that could be used in limited operations in a "madman" 
scenario. 
  Instead the strategy remains that of "the weak against the 
strong", as during the Cold War when the French deterrent was 
aimed against tens of thousands of Soviet warheads, the sources 
said. 
  Mitterrand has ordered an acceleration in the development of 
a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, the M5, scheduled to 
succeed the M45 in the year 2005. 
  The white paper will be presented to parliamentary defence 
and foreign affairs comissions ahead of debate in the National 
Assembly next June on financing new weapons over the five years 
1995-2000.

<F P=106> [Column by Rene Galy-Dejean, chairman of the National </F>
Assembly's Defense Commission and Rally for the Republic deputy 
in Paris: "Mr. Mitterrand's Trap" -- first paragraph is LE 
MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] After the ministerial meeting in the Elysee 
[presidential office] on Wednesday 15 February to discuss the 
Defense White Paper, Rene Galy-Dejean, author of two 
parliamentary reports on nuclear testing and the armaments 
industry, accused Francois Mitterrand of setting a trap for the 
majority concerning the M5 strategic missile. 
  One of the particularly tough problems in the military 
planning law is to be found in the fate reserved for the future 
M5 missile. Between 2005 and 2010, this missile could replace 
the M45, which is currently under development for the new 
generation of submarines. The M45 will carry the latest nuclear 
warhead, the TN75. Thus renovated, the French strategic ocean 
force will comprise, by unanimous opinion, a tool for deterrence 
whose reliability can be guaranteed for the next 10 years. 
  In this context, what question should the politicians in 
charge be asking? In my opinion, the immediate development of 
the M5 is the most serious mistake that could be made in the 
drafting of the planning law. Not only would it be a mistake in 
technological terms, but also in budgetary, strategic, and 
therefore political terms. 
  Technologically, the gain in performance attributed to the 
future missile -- and the gain which is likely to be achieved -- 
concerns range, accuracy, payload, and stealth. So far, 
however, this improved missile is felt to go hand in hand with a 
new warhead, the TN100, which is already in the design stage at 
the Atomic Energy Commission. This load will yield enhanced 
performance in terms of penetration and accuracy. 
  Is all this so very urgent? This does, it is true, represent 
decisive progress, but in only one area: The enhanced range 
"gives water" to submarines, i.e., it allows them to patrol in 
warm waters and to increase their potential and safety. 
However, as for the rest, there are a great many contradictions 
and uncertainties in the process! 
<H5>  Contradiction </H5>
  We are increasing the surface of the targeted objective, 
while at the same time a consensus is emerging for moving away 
from a "city- oriented" doctrine of deterrence toward a doctrine 
based on the destruction of forces, in other words one that is 
more "targeted" and sophisticated. We are increasing the volume 
and payload of the missile's warhead, while every indicator 
points to a constant move toward nuclear warheads which are 
smaller in volume and weight, but which have equal strength. 
This is even one of France's specialties. Moreover, we are 
implementing a new armaments system based on the TN100 -- a 
warhead that is innovative in terms of design and operation -- 
at a time when we are suspending nuclear tests and when, as a 
result, we are banning the validation of its design and 
development, and therefore the verification of the sought-after 
results. 
  To get around this contradiction, it is said that the 
current 
TN75 warhead, which will soon be in service, can be improved and 
adapted to the new M5 missile. This weakens the rhetoric and 
the deterrence. We find ourselves involved in an approach based 
on opportunity and not efficiency. Such opportunism has 
characterized the M5 missile since its birth and places a 
terrible financial burden on the defense budget and planning law. 
  It is estimated that the M5 missile alone, without its 
nuclear warhead, will cost around 65 billion francs. Its launch 
was announced to the Aerospatiale group in January 1992 -- two 
months before the last legislative elections -- in a letter from 
the defense minister (Pierre Joxe). This baptism may appear 
blighted with some suspicion of electioneering, even if I do not 
ignore the problematically low order load of Aerospatiale's 
"strategic missiles" division. 
  Yet, was the military staff in favor of this? Was a decision 
made in the Defense Council? 
  At the same time, the Defense Ministry published a 
"reference 
document" on planning, the stand-in for the law that was not 
discussed in Parliament. This "reference document" clearly 
showed that merely pursuing the irreversible programmes already 
under way would put too much pressure on the budget capacity in 
the medium term. Of course, funding allocated to the M5 missile 
in the 1993 budget was low, and it will be equally low in 1994. 
However, what will become of the new planning law if program 
authorizations have to be increased in the short term? We thus 
deprive the law of any maneuvering room, unless one major 
ongoing project is canceled. And who will take that risk? 
<H5>  Deterrence Thwarted </H5>
  Consequently, we are blocking the development of our 
deterrence strategy. This development, which now enjoys broad 
consensus within the Armed Forces and the majority, is imposed 
by geopolitical upheavals. 
  We know the broad outlines of this consensus. Submarines are 
an important -- if not key -- strategic element in our defense 
apparatus, but the search for greater flexibility and improved 
adaptation to the new context has led to the implementation of a 
second airborne "component" fitted with the LRAS (long-range 
air-to- surface) missile. This "component" would have strike 
capacities for a second and final warning. 
  At the same time, the discussion of the implementation of 
antimissile protection is necessary in our country. From now 
on, Aerospatiale -- despite the defection of the British over 
the LRAS -- is in a position to develop missiles capable of 
stopping ballistic missiles at mid-altitude. In addition, the 
company alone can equip France with a long-range air-to-surface 
missile. 
  All this will be made financially impossible by the further 
development of the M5 missile. This missile will destroy what 
little flexibility a sustained budgetary effort could give to 
the planning law. 
  It is here that we meet up with politics again. The trap 
which the president of the republic has just set for the 
government and its majority was laid out in a sentence spoken in 
an interview given to AFP by Francois Mitterrand (LE MONDE of 11 
January). He spoke of a "new missile which comprises a major 
improvement, namely in terms of range, and which could also be 
installed on the Albion platform." 
  So here is the M5 destroying the entire planning with all 
its 
might. Here is the compromised strategic development, the 
second weakened nuclear "component," and the antiballistic 
protection system postponed indefinitely. Here, lastly, is the 
Albion platform put back in the saddle and the "sanctuarization" 
of the reactivated territory. 
  Such a regression in our nuclear strategy is inconceivable. 
Or perhaps we are to think that Mr. Mitterrand, who came to 
power with a strong prejudice against deterrence, will leave his 
post by depriving his successor of this powerful tool, after he 
himself made use of it. The halting of nuclear testing and the 
fate of the M5 make one wonder. My feeling is that it would be 
desirable to stagger the implementation of the M5 in order to 
give France some latitude in adapting its strategy and equipping 
its forces for a new and dangerous world that is now emerging.

<F P=106> [Report by Christian Sturm and Thomas Scheuer: "Flying </F>
Dealers"] 
  [Text] The mystery surrounding the obscure Cessna crash 
into Lake Constance continues. The police intend to continue 
the search for the dead bodies of the five missing passengers 
presumed to be at the bottom of Lake Constance. The 
investigators rule out that survivors might have been able to 
save themselves from the ice-cold water. Radar recordings do 
not give any information about a secret stopover between Prague 
and Lake Constance. 
  The business deals of the passengers also continue to remain 
mainly in the dark. According to research by FOCUS, one thing, 
however, seems to be the clear: Berlin businessmen Josef 
Rimmele, 54, and Klaus Eichler, 53, along with their two Czech 
companions, intended to fly to Beijing two days later. 
  In their appointment book a note was found of a planned 
meeting with three-star General Jin Kang Wang from the PRC 
Foreign Ministry. The two men from Berlin had been planning a 
dubious deal with him for months: The Chinese general wanted to 
get rid of 6 kg of the extremely rare metal Osmium 187 and 365 
kg of the controversial phantom substance Red Mercury -- at the 
steep price of $493 million. The following route had been 
requested for the trip to Beijing and already approved by the 
Russian and Chinese authorities: Prague, Moscow, Novosibirsk, 
Ulaanbaatar, Beijing. 
  Embarrassing for Bonn: Only five weeks before the disaster 
at Lake Constance, the trade delegate of the FRG Embassy in 
Beijing had sent a diplomatic note to the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry requesting flight and landing rights for an earlier 
flight of the dubious black marketeers. 
  Josef Rimmele, against whom Berlin judicial authorities 
issued an arrest warrant on the grounds of fraud, played false. 
He intended to carry out the adventurous million-dollar deal 
via his letter-box firm "Housebuilders-Service-Establishment" in 
Vaduz, Liechtenstein. Yet the company was deleted from the trade 
registered there as early as November 1993. The two 
Liechtenstein trustees withdrew from their mandate because 
Rimmele wanted to establish "dubious business constructions," as 
legal agent Hans Gassner confirmed for FOCUS. 
  The head of an officially recognized test laboratory in 
Saxony had already been hired for the trip to Beijing. He would 
have analyzed the exotic metals. 
  It remains unclear what Rimmele wanted to do with that 
stuff. 
In the view of expert Tomas Tamberg of the Federal Institute 
for Material Research (BAM) in Berlin, such transactions do not 
make any commercial sense. The demand for the valuable Osmium 
187 for scientific and research projects was "in the area of 
fractions of milligrams." As far as the legendary Red Mercury, 
a harmless mercury compound, is concerned, Tamberg does not see 
any use at all. The alleged demand in the armament industry is 
regarded by the BAM scientist as "absolute and total nonsense." 
  A Berlin state prosecutor suspects completely different 
motives behind such activities as those of Rimmele. Pure money 
laundering may be behind such fictitious transactions.

<F P=106> [Article by Mark Watts and Bill Goodwin: "UK Clamp on Iraqi </F>
Bomb Clues"] 
  [Text] Key documents containing potentially the most 
embarrassing details about Britain's "arms to Iraq" scandal have 
been suppressed, THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH has learned. 
  The papers, part of a United Nations dossier which was 
passed 
to the British Government more than two years ago, related to 
the role of UK industry in building Saddam Hussein's nuclear 
bomb. 
  Since the Gulf war, UN inspectors have found that UK-made 
computers, electronics and machine tools were used in Iraq's 
nuclear bomb production line. 
  The findings imply that British companies were not only 
exporting arms to Iraq, but were also supplying parts for the 
country's nuclear programme. Yet Customs has not prosecuted any 
of the companies alleged by the UN to have been involved. 
  Six members of the defence team in the "nuclear triggers" 
case, the only "arms to Iraq" trial in Britain where people have 
been jailed, have obtained copies of the crucial UN papers from 
Customs and Excise in preparation for an appeal that is due to 
be heard within the next two months. 
  Customs has persuaded the Lord Chief Justice to make an 
order 
banning the six from divulging the contents of the papers. 
  Lord Taylor granted an application at a secret special 
hearing, and any breach would be a contempt of court punishable 
by up to two years' jail. 
  The UN papers have been kept secret during the time of John 
Major's government, and blame cannot be laid on Margaret 
Thatcher's administration as other "arms to Iraq" fiascos have 
been. 
  Sources suggest that civil servants have tried to avoid 
further embarrassment for the Government by deciding not to 
volunteer to disclose the documents to the Scott inquiry, which 
is due to hear evidence from the Prime Minister next week. 
  A DTI spokeswoman would say only: "The Scott inquiry has 
been 
set up to look at all these matters and it is for the Scott 
inquiry to consider all questions related to this subject." 
  Lady Thatcher told the Scott inquiry last month that when 
she 
was Prime Minister, she was "particularly concerned" that no 
exports for Saddam's nuclear bomb programme should leave 
Britain's shores. She told Lord Justice Scott: "The thought of 
anything nuclear getting into the hands of a government in Iraq, 
who would have no scruples about the use of the ultimate weapon, 
was absolutely horrific." 
  The Sunday Telegraph has not asked any of the 
"gagged" six to defy the banning order. An 18-month undercover 
US-UK customs operation -- which was praised at the Scott 
inquiry by Lady Thatcher -- resulted in the conviction of Ali 
Daghir and Jeanine Speckman in 1991 for trying to export 
capacitors allegedly destined for the detonation device of 
Iraq's nuclear bomb. 
  Senior Customs figures were so concerned about keeping the 
embarrassing UN documents secret that they discussed seeking an 
injunction to prevent the broadcast last month of an ITV 
programme about the nuclear triggers case, in the mistaken fear 
that it would disclose the contents of the papers. 
  A producer at the programme "The Big Story" said: "There was 
even a call to the office on the day of transmission from 
someone claiming to be from Customs who said we were about to 
have several injunctions served on us. A newspaper newsdesk was 
then tipped off that we were being banned. But it never 
happened." 
  Daghir and Speckman were sentenced to five years and 18 
months respectively, and Speckman has completed her sentence. 
Both are appealing on several grounds. 
  Two years ago, THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH revealed that a secret 
Iraqi report seized by UN inspectors cast doubt on the 
convictions. The report suggested that electronic components 
intercepted by British Customs officers in a highly publicised 
"sting" at London's Heathrow Airport in 1990 had nothing to do 
with Saddam's nuclear bomb project. On the strength of this, 
Daghir was released from jail on &pound;200,000 bail pending 
appeal. 
  Other evidence in our possession points to their innocence. 
This includes covertly recorded tapes of conversations 
suggesting US Customs undercover agents set up Daghir and 
Speckman. 
  After obtaining the Iraqi report, an expert witness for the 
defence sought more of the three-volume UN dossier to see if 
there was more evidence in it to support the defence claim of 
wrongful conviction. Dr. John Hassard, a nuclear expert at 
London's Imperial College, was given more documents by the UN's 
International Atomic Energy Agency and yet more by the DTI -- 
with no conditions attached. He and the defence team obtained 
further sections from Customs. 
  While claiming that they were irrelevant to the case, 
Customs 
lawyers agreed to hand over to the defence team, on a 
confidential basis, the sections from the UN dossier listing the 
British manufacturers which allegedly sent exports for Iraq's 
nuclear programme in breach of sanctions. 
  UN inspections of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme found 
that 
UK companies supplied computers and built a semiconductor 
manufacturing plant. Inspectors also found machinery in Saddam 
Hussain's bomb production line from nine British machine tool 
companies. 
  It is understood that the suppressed papers are viewed by 
the 
defence lawyers as another crucial part of the new evidence on 
which they will seek to rely at their appeal because the lists 
do not include their export company, Euromac. In view of the 
basis on which the gagging order was obtained, and the fact that 
their appeal will be heard in public, they are likely to meet 
stiff opposition from Customs. 
  The Customs' position is that no comment can be made on any 
matter related to the Daghir and Speckman case while their 
appeal is pending and the Scott inquiry is still running.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] North Korea officially notified on 15 February that 
it will accept full-scope [chonmyon] inspection of seven nuclear 
facilities as demanded by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA]. Therefore, full-scope inspection on North Korea is 
expected to be resumed from early next week at the earliest. 
  North Korea held working-level contacts with the IAEA on two 
occasions on the afternoon of 15 February, and officially 
notified that it will accept the IAEA's full-scope inspection of 
its seven nuclear facilities. 
  The IAEA revealed that the resumption of the full-scope 
inspection on North Korea is to closely examine whether North 
Korea diverted the nuclear material of its seven nuclear 
facilities for military purposes since normal [chongsang] 
inspection on North Korea has been suspended since February 
1993. The inspection team plans to carry out a series of 
inspection activities including the overall replacement of 
monitoring devices and replacement of sealing devices to 
safeguard the continuity of the inspection which has been 
damaged. 
  With the acceptance of the full-scope inspection by North 
Korea, the IAEA notified the North Korean side by letter that it 
will dispatch the inspection team as soon as procedures are 
completed for the team to visit North Korea. If North Korea 
actively cooperates in the inspection team's preparations to 
visit North Korea, the inspection team consisting of six or 
seven people will be able to go to Pyongyang sometime this 
weekend and thus carry out inspection activities in Yongbyon 
from early next week when the IAEA Board of Governor's meeting 
takes place. 
  Counselor Yun Ho-chin, the working-level delegate of the 
North Korean side, said that the decision to accept the 
full-scope inspection was made with utmost flexibility by the 
North Korean side to achieve denuclearization on the Korean 
peninsula and was achieved by making concessions with the IAEA.

  [Excerpts] Vienna, Feb 15 (AFP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reached agreement here 
Tuesday on resuming inspections of Pyongyang's nuclear 
facilities after a year-long standoff, the agency's spokesman 
said. 
  The agreement eased international tensions which had been 
tightened another notch a day earlier by the most unequivocal in 
a series of claims that Pyongyang has an active nuclear weapons 
programme. 
  But the accord makes no provision for inspection of the two 
Yongbyon sites where the suspected nuclear arms facility is 
based. 
  IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the two sides had reached an 
accord on inspecting seven identified sites and that a six- or 
seven-strong IAEA mission of two to three weeks' duration would 
enter North Korea as soon as visa formalities had been dealt 
with. 
  Welcoming the accord, Kyd said that, if all went well, the 
mission could get under way in the next few days, adding that 
Pyongyang had accepted all IAEA demands concerning the nature of 
the inspections. 
  He stressed the agreement did not cover the two undeclared 
sites at Yongbyon, where the IAEA suspected that Pyongyang was 
illegally stockpiling liquid and solid nuclear waste. 
  He said those sites would be the subject of future 
negotiations. 
  The accord comes six days before a meeting of IAEA governors 
at which future relations with North Korea are due to be 
discussed. 
  Kyd added that the aim of the inspections at the seven 
declared sites was to "verify that nuclear material in these 
facilities has not been diverted since earlier inspections." 
  "In addition, inspectors will take certain measures, such as 
reloading of cameras and changing of seals, to facilitate future 
verifications." [passage omitted] 
  Earlier Tuesday in Tokyo, Japan's JIJI Press quoted official 
South Korean sources as saying Pyongyang's absolute leader Kim 
Il- Sung had proposed a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton 
over the nuclear issue. 
  Kim made the proposal through U.S. Southern Baptist 
evangelist Billy Graham, who met the North Korean president and 
party chief when he visited Pyongyang in late January, the 
sources said. 
  Russian researchers told JIJI Monday that the former Soviet 
Union had been engaged in a joint plan with North Korea to build 
a nuclear bomb until 1985, and that Russian scientists continued 
to provide clandestine assistance to Pyongyang.

  [Text] An International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] source 
revealed that the IAEA will not inspect fuel rods at the 
experimental atomic reactor during nuclear inspections in North 
Korea this weekend. This source explained that this is because 
the inspection of the fuel rods is only possible when fuel rods 
are changed. This source also added that the IAEA inspection 
team will only inspect the monitoring camera and the sealing of 
the atomic reactor.

<F P=106> [Report by Ingrid Steiner: "North Korea's Pawn Continues To </F>
Be Well Hidden"] 
  [Excerpt] When the delegation of experts of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspect the North 
Korean nuclear facilities on Yongbon, every step will be 
carefully observed. They will not be allowed to deviate a single 
inch from the determined route or take a closer look at an earth 
mound or a tree at the giant plant. The strictly communist North 
Korea will not allow any inspections of the site where the IAEA 
expects underground secret nuclear plants to be located. 
  "We know that the two plants exist," IAEA spokesman David 
Kyd 
told KURIER. "They are clearly recognized on satellite 
pictures. They are located right in the center of the Yongbon 
site. " 
  However, North Korea denies everything categorically. The 
plants in question are merely "military facilities." 
  In the seven declared nuclear plants to which the IAEA will 
be granted access, North Korea cannot build an "atomic bomb" but 
rather fissile material. "North Korea started its nuclear 
program 20 years ago. We are absolutely certain that it 
possesses more plutonium than Pyongyang admits," Kyd stressed. 
Only 5-8 kg are needed to produce a single atomic bomb. 
  According to Kyd, the required pressure to ensure the 
inspection of the two secret plants can only be exerted by the 
United States. "The IAEA does not have any instruments; only 
Washington has something to offer" -- that is economic aid for 
the extremely poor North Korea or the U.S. promise to renounce 
the large-scale maneuver, planned together with South Korea.

  [Text] It has been learned on 8 March that the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team for 
North Korean nuclear facilities, which began it activities on 3 
March, is not proceeding well with inspections. 
  A high-ranking government official said on 8 March, "North 
Korea is objecting to some of the IAEA's inspection activities. 
Particularly, it is rejecting the extraction of samples from a 
radioactive chemistry laboratory in Yongbyon which is estimated 
to be a nuclear reprocessing facility." 
  The official continued, "North Korea and the IAEA agreed in 
Vienna to the extraction of samples from the radioactive 
chemistry laboratory although the extraction of samples from the 
five-megawatt reactor is not possible because it is not a 
replacement of a fuel rod. There can be no concession because 
this is the core of the IAEA inspection." 
  The government authority added, "However, we have to wait 
and 
see to judge whether the IAEA inspection team's activities are 
successfully concluded. That will be around this weekend or 
early next week."

  [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- Seoul denied reports 
Wednesday that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
inspections were being hampered in North Korea. 
  "The inspections are going smoothly so far," said a Foreign 
Ministry official. "IAEA activities are expected to conclude 
around March 14 or 15." 
  The IAEA inspectors who arrived in Pyongyang on March 3 have 
just about finished checking five of the seven declared 
facilities, the official said. However, the remaining two 
installations -- a 5- megawatt nuclear reactor and a 
radiochemical laboratory used for reprocessing -- are critical 
in determining whether North Korea diverted any nuclear material 
for non-peaceful uses. 
  The vernacular daily TONG-A ILBO reported that North Korea 
was restricting IAEA access to these two facilities. The story 
came out on the same day South and North Korea were to meet at 
the truce village of Panmunjom to arrange an exchange of 
presidential envoys.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Sin Chang-uk] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that during inspection of 
Yongbyon, which began 3 March, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] inspection team discovered that some seals, which 
were installed by IAEA to confirm nuclear safeguards of nuclear 
facilities in North Korea, were destroyed. As a result, it is 
highly likely that considerable controversies will be touched 
off concerning the guarantee of transparency of North Korean 
nuclear development. 
  In the course of inspecting seven nuclear facilities in 
North 
Korea on six occasions in 1993, the IAEA inspected six 
monitoring cameras, 40 seals, and three radioactivity sensor 
facilities. In the event that damage of these facilities is 
confirmed, suspicion that nuclear material was transferred from 
North Korean nuclear facilities to some other place will be 
raised. Thus, there is a possibility that the continuity of 
safeguards of North Korean nuclear facilities may not be 
recognized. 
  A source in Washington said that with discovery of such seal 
damage, the conclusion of the results of IAEA's inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities will be the focus of people's 
attention. The likelihood that the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. high-level talks slated for 21 March in Geneva will 
be held as scheduled is doubtful. 
  It was reported that in the course of IAEA's inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities, disputes arose between IAEA and 
North Korea over the issue of continuing the inspection and the 
damage to the seals. 
  The team has to leave Pyongyang on 14 March as the IAEA 
inspection team was granted two-week entry visas upon its 
arrival in Pyongyang on 1 March. 
  This being the situation, this week will likely be the 
climax 
of IAEA's inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, and the 
possibility of resolving the issue of the exchange of special 
envoys between the North and the South before 21 March is very 
slim because North Korea has continually showed an attitude of 
rejection. 
  Another source observed that North Korea will likely drag on 
the controversy surrounding the inspection and the issue of 
North-South special envoy exchange even after 21 March when the 
third round of high-level talks are scheduled to be held. Thus, 
the possibility of high-level talks being held on the scheduled 
date is slim. 
  Meanwhile, Christine Shelley, a U.S. State Department 
spokesperson, on 9 March said that the U.S. Government regrets 
the fact that the IAEA nuclear inspection of North Korea is not 
proceeding smoothly and expressed the hope that North Korea will 
keep its promise to sincerely allow IAEA inspections until the 
inspections are concluded. Commenting on friction between North 
Korea and IAEA over nuclear inspections, Shelley said that she 
hopes the IAEA can settle the inspection issue and that the 
inspections will be concluded. Shelley stressed that regardless 
of progress in North-South working contact, the exchange of 
North-South special envoys, with satisfactory nuclear inspection 
results, are a precondition for holding the third round of 
high-level talks agreed to by North Korea.

<F P=106> [Article by Nick Rufford, Far East correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Japan has acquired all the parts necessary for a 
nuclear weapon and may even have built a bomb which requires 
only enriched plutonium for completion, according to a secret 
government report. 
  The Ministry of Defence has warned Downing Street that the 
crisis over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes is 
threatening to force Japan to abandon its non-nuclear stance. 
The risks are detailed in a paper to the Joint Intelligence 
Committee, Whitehall's main security body, which advises the 
cabinet and the prime minister. 
  The report, sent last month, reveals that Japan has key 
bomb-making components, including plutonium and electronic 
triggers, and has the expertise to "go nuclear" very quickly. 
  One expert who has seen the report said: "They (the 
Japanese) 
could have acquired all the expertise for imploding a weapon 
without breaking safeguards. All they would need to do is 
select adequate amounts of plutonium for the core." 
  American intelligence officials said President Bill Clinton 
has given up hope of stopping North Korea getting nuclear 
weapons, a setback which is likely to spark a regional arms 
race. The Pyongyang government still refuses to allow full 
inspections of two disputed nuclear sites. 
  Tension increased last week when America announced it would 
deploy the Patriot antimissile system in South Korea. North 
Korea described the move as an "unpardonable grave military 
challenge." 
  The Patriots are supposed to help reassure South Korea and 
Japan by providing a first-line defence. But they will not 
prevent Japan developing a nuclear deterrent if it fears a 
surprise attack, intelligence sources said. 
  The turning point would come if North Korea improves the 
accuracy and range of its Nodong missile. The weapon, a version 
of the Iraqi Scud, can carry a nuclear or chemical payload; last 
May it landed a test flight in the Sea of Japan. 
  The Whitehall report emphasises there is no evidence yet 
that 
Japan has taken the decision to proceed with a nuclear bomb 
programme, or that it has strayed from its commitments to the 
international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  Japan has its own reprocessing plant for producing plutonium 
and has also contracted Britain and France to supply several 
tonnes of plutonium from Japanese spent reactor fuel. It also 
has sophisticated rockets for launching space satellites that 
could be converted to intermediate or long-range missiles. 
  Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, recently 
confirmed 
that he was "very strongly concerned" by North Korea's growing 
military strength. "The missile North Korea is developing has a 
range of 1,000km and could hit much of Japan eight minutes after 
it is launched," he said. "How to develop a defence against 
that is a matter of great concern to Japan." 
  North Korea is growing increasingly unstable as food 
shortages and electricity blackouts blight the bankrupt nation. 
Kim Il Sung, the 81-year-old dictator, warned in a new year 
address that any effort to pressure his country into reforms 
"may invite catastrophe." 
  The Central Intelligence agency last week repeated its 
warning that North Korea probably had enough plutonium for one 
or two nuclear bombs. It also warned of its "heightened state 
of military readiness" and the deployment of rocket launchers 
and artillery close to the demilitarized zone. 
  America has threatened economic sanctions if North Korea 
fails to agree by February 22 to allow inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. North Korea replied it 
would suspend the armistice on the Korean Peninsula if Clinton 
pushed for sanctions.

  [Text] The government and electric power companies on 17 
February agreed to slow down the rate at which they use 
plutonium and to delay -- by up to 20 years -- the start-up of 
the second nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, the use of nuclear 
fuel in light- water reactors, and the start of construction of 
a demonstration fast breeder reactor. 
  Japan at present has an unusual plutonium utilization plan, 
but in view of international criticism of the plan and its 
economic feasibility, it seems certain Japan will make major 
changes to it. These changes will be incorporated in the 
government's long-term program on the development and use of 
nuclear power, which is now being revised. 
  The second reprocessing plant is scheduled to be built after 
the one under construction now in Rokkasho-mura, Aormori 
Prefecture, is completed. Under current plans, the plant is 
targeted for completion and start-up by around 2010. The plan 
is being revised to delay completion until 2030. 
  The reason given for the revision is that if the plant 
starts 
up in 2010, the plutonium it produces may be in excess of 
domestic requirements. This would break the national pledge not 
to "possess plutonium in excess of needs." 
  In addition, the government and power companies have not yet 
been able to decide on what new technology should be used on the 
second reprocessing plant -- on the reprocessing of fuel 
generated by the fast breeder reactor, for instance. 
  The revised long-term plan, consequently, is not expected to 
carry a specific plant completion date but to state, instead, 
that a policy on the issue will be presented in about 2010. 
  Since the delay in the construction of the second 
reprocessing plant will mean that existing power plants become 
short of storage space for the spent fuel from nuclear power 
reactors, the revised plan will present measures which include 
dry storage [kanshiki chozo]. 
  The power companies have between them agreed to 
simultaneously start using plutonium in light-water reactors in 
1998. 
  Under the current plan, two reactors are supposed to begin 
using plutonium in the latter half of the 1990's, and 12 others 
are to begin using it after 2000. Under the revision, each of 
the 10 electric power companies will use it in at least one of 
their reactors, and up to 15 reactors will be using it 
nationally by 2010.

  [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Corporation 
[PRNFC] has compiled the results of its study of the actinide 
recycling process, a process by which fast-breeder reactors 
[FBR] can burn plutonium retrieved from spent nuclear fuel 
together with transuranium elements, which are the byproducts of 
reprocessed plutonium. As it is now technically possible to use 
as reactor core fuel a mixture of up to 5 percent transuranium 
elements with plutonium, prospects have brightened for the 
practical use of the process whereby an FBR can burn 
transuranium elements generated by six light-water reactors of 
the same scale as the FBR. The PRNFC plans to step up research 
efforts, including the start of irradiation tests this summer 
using transuranium elements at "Joyo," an experimental FBR. 
  The PRNFC set up a simulation at a "Monju" reactor [a 
prototype FBR]. For reactor core fuel it used an approximately 
5-percent mixture, or about 500 kilograms, of three types of 
transuranium elements -- neptunium, americium, and curium -- in 
combination with two tons of plutonium and about seven tons of 
uranium. The tests suggested that increasing the mixture of 
transuranium elements to more than 5 percent adversely affected 
reactor core performance. It can, for example, lower the 
melting point of the nuclear fuel. 
  In the simulation it was found that a yearly average of 
about 
40 kilograms of transuranium elements can be eliminated using 
the actinide recycling process. The spent nuclear fuel 
resulting from this process can be reprocessed, separating 
bred-plutonium from radioactive waste. To produce new fuel, the 
reprocessed plutonium can then be combined with the necessary 
amounts of uranium and transuranium elements to supplement those 
eliminated in the initial process. This new fuel can then be 
burned under the same conditions again. 
  According to the PRNFC, a 1-million-kilowatt-class 
light-water reactor annually generates an average of 40-50 
kilograms of transuranium elements, of which neptunium and 
americium account for close to 50 percent each, while curium 
accounts for about 5 percent. Although it has been found that 
neptunium and americium can be efficiently eliminated with 
FBR's, curium, on the other hand, has been found to increase 
three-fold in volume. 
  In order to grasp actual physical properties of transuranium 
elements when they disintegrate, irradiation tests using 
imported samples will be conducted with the Joyo. Moreover, 
there are plans to begin experiments with americium-based 
nuclear fuel, possibly in fiscal year 1998.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 15 (CTK) -- Czech Parliament today 
passed a government bill on foreign trade with military 
materials, which lays down conditions for such trade and 
determines the powers of state administrative bodies to enforce 
them. 
  Ministry of Trade and Industry Vladimir Dlouhy said the law 
stipulated conditions and procedures for granting permits on 
trade of foreign-made materials, and for granting licenses for 
specific trade deals. 
  According to the law, weapons of mass destruction, that is 
nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, must not be included 
in any trade of military materials. The understanding of 
military materials includes, apart from technical equipment and 
its components, also services granted in this connection. 
  Trade with military material can now be conducted only by a 
legal entity based in the territory of the Czech Republic, 
following the receipt of a permit issued by the Industry and 
Trade Ministry and approval from the Foreign, Defense, and 
Interior Ministries. 
  "We shall be the first country of the former Eastern bloc to 
adopt independent legislation for this sensitive area, following 
the example of advanced countries," Dlouhy said. 
  The Industry and Trade Ministry will supervise adherence to 
the law. If it finds that a legal entity has broken any 
regulation of the law, it will be entitled to impose on it a 
fine of up to five million Czech crowns. If a breach of the law 
causes damage to the Czech Republic, the fine may be up to six 
times as high. 
  The weapons trade law also amends the Law on Small 
Businesses 
and the Penal Code. The amendment of the Penal Code rests in 
that the Law on Weapons Trade includes regulations prohibiting 
trade with military material. An individual, for instance, who 
engages in a deal with military material without permission or a 
license will receive a prison term of one to eight years, or can 
have further commercial activities prohibited and/or receive a 
fine.

<F P=106> [Article by Sonia Carneiro] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia -- Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral 
Mario Cesar Flores on 7 February admitted that the Brazilian 
Government is willing to allow the inspection of its nuclear 
plants at the request of a third country as long as the request 
is lodged with the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA). 
Flores asked government leader Pedro Simon to ask the Senate to 
immediately approve the two nuclear nonproliferation treaties to 
avoid retaliatory measures against Brazil. 
  Flores said: "There is no reason to fear the ratification of 
the agreement if we do not intend to build the atomic bomb." He 
made this statement following Germany's threat to break the 
nuclear agreement and suspend the transfer of technology to 
Brazil. 
  The Senate today will only vote on the proposal by Senator 
Dirceu Carneiro (PMDB-SC [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party-Santa Catarina]) in favor of the approval of one of the 
nuclear safeguard agreements. According to the agreement, 
Brazil, Argentina, the Abacc (Brazilian-Argentine Agency for 
Accounting and Control), and the AIEA agree to supervise the 
production of nuclear material restricting technological 
development to peaceful purposes, safeguard nuclear secrets, and 
authorize the Navy to build a nuclear submarine. Brazil does 
not have to reveal its technological secrets. Should an 
inspection be carried out, Brazil will not be forced to reveal 
how it enriches uranium. 
  The possibility of overcoming the impasse affecting the 
ratification of the Tlatelolco Treaty that bans nuclear weapons 
in Latin America seems difficult. Carneiro, coordinator of the 
legislative decree on the treaty, has imposed a new condition: 
the elimination of an article allowing special inspections at 
nuclear plants at the request of a third country. But, at 
Itamaraty's request, Senate President Humberto Lucena has put 
the agreement on the list of issues to be voted on today without 
being submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  Contrary to Lucena's decision, Carneiro has requested that 
the agreement be eliminated from the list of issues to be voted 
on. He wants the four-party agreement to be given priority 
treatment. Carneiro said reports that Germany intends to break 
the nuclear agreement due to the Senate's delay in approving the 
nuclear safeguards are "illogical and untrue." According to 
him, "the Tlatelolco Treaty is a regional treaty to ban nuclear 
weapons from Latin America, and it has nothing to do with the 
agreement with Germany that contemplated the construction of 
eight nuclear plants. None of which were built."

  [Text] Russia and Kazakhstan intend to use 
inter-continental military missiles SS-18 for launching 
commercial satellites to the round the Earth orbit (up to 
1,000km). 
  Interfax has learnt about the project providing for the test 
launching of the missile with a simplified version of a 
satellite. The project is to demonstrate real possibility of the 
missile for launching commercial loads with the minimal changes 
in the docking unit. 
  Experts believe the missile may put into orbit the load 
weighing about 600 kilos and it could be used for implementing 
the existing programmes of satellite communication systems on 
the basis of low-orbit satellites. 
  A representative of the Russian Space Agency who has a 
direct 
involvement to the implementation of the project with the use of 
SS-18, has told Interfax that so far the launching of the 
missile is in question because the Russian Military Space force, 
which control missile systems and space vehicles, has not OKed 
the project. 
  The spokesman did not rule out the possibility that the 
problem would be raised at the talks on conditions of leasing 
the space center Baykonur and the military cooperation in Almaty 
that are to begin in a week (the Russian delegation will leave 
for Almaty on March 9) 
  Missiles SS-18 are to be destroyed in line with the 
Russian-U.S. treaty START-2 before the year 2003. Now 104 SS-18 
missiles are based in Kazakhstan.

  [Text] The State Committee for Control over Atomic Safety 
(Gosatomnadzor) said the state of nuclear and radiation safety 
in Russia is unsatisfactory. 
  The body came to this conclusion after an inspection of the 
safety of all nuclear and radiation-emanating installations in 
the country carried out last year in accordance with Boris 
Yeltsin's decision. 
  According to Gosatomnadzor, issues related to use of nuclear 
power, materials and substances in both peaceful and defense 
purposes are solved very slowly as they lack a legislative 
basis. As a result, re-cycling or dumping spent nuclear fuel 
alone will require considerable financial and material costs. 
  At present, as many as 29 nuclear reactors with total 
capacity of 21242 Megawatt function in Russia, including 13 
VVER, 11 RBMK-1000, 4 low-capacity EGP-6 and one fast neutron 
BN-600. All these reactors were launched between 1971 and 1990, 
except for the fourth reactor of the Balakovskaya nuclear power 
station which was launched in 1993. 
  There were no serious accidents at nuclear power stations in 
1993 which would lead to releasing significant amounts of 
nuclear materials into the atmosphere or hazardous fires, except 
for several instances of overheating. About half of the 
accidents were caused by reckless maintenance of the equipment 
by personnel. 
  Commenting on the state of the equipment, the committee 
pointed out that the reactors were maintained according to the 
safety requirements which were valid when the reactors were 
launched. At the moment, the reactors fail to comply with the 
modern safety requirements. The committee said the 
first-generation reactors installed at such stations as 
Novovoronezhskaya, Kolskaya, Leningradskaya, Kurskaya and 
Bilibinskaya were designed before the basic documents on atomic 
safety were released in Russia. Now they need drastic 
reconstruction, and such work is being carried out. The first 
and second reactors of the Novovoronezhskaya and Beloyarskaya 
stations have been closed down to be subsequently dumped. 
  An analysis of the accidents which occurred in 1991-1993 
showed a sharp aggravation of the situation at the Kolskaya 
nuclear power station caused by poor maintenance and repair of 
its equipment. 
  Gosatomnadzor also pointed out that spent nuclear fuel is 
practically not taken out of the stations equipped with RBMK and 
EGP reactors, while its removal from other stations is not fast 
enough. The accumulation of spent nuclear fuel may cause a 
situation when there is no free space to dispose of the 
reactor's entire active area in an emergency as safety 
requirements demand. At present, none of Russia's nuclear power 
stations is equipped with the entire complex of installations 
for dumping liquid and solid nuclear waste. The nuclear storage 
facilities are filled to an average of 702000070040f capacity. The 
committee believes that the storage capacities may be exhausted 
in 2-3 years, given the current speed of piling up nuclear waste.

  [Text] Russia's State Atomic Inspection Committee reports 
that the radiation safety standards of most of the Northern 
Fleet's facilities are unsatisfactory. 
  A check carried out by this committee jointly with other 
agencies revealed that some of the Northern Fleet's personnel 
had been exposed to excessive radiation dozes (7 people were 
hospitalized). Nuclear materials are not properly isolated, 
while nuclear facilities and ships are operated with violations 
of the safety regulations. Some of the installations, put out 
of service, have not been placed in a safe condition. 
  The State Atomic Inspection Committee is seriously concerned 
about the handling of nuclear wastes. Containers are overloaded 
and no measures are taken to process the radioactive wastes. 
Liquid wastes are still being dumped into the sea. 
  The committee reports that it has informed the Defense 
Ministry of the alarming situation on the Northern Fleet. 
  It says that on October 17, a TMT-27 tanker dumped liquid 
radioactive wastes 105 miles east of Vladivostok and 295 miles 
from the Japanese island of Hokkaido, all of which aroused 
Japan's and Korea's protests. The introduction of state control 
over the radiation safety of the Defense Ministry's facilities 
is a must, says the State Atomic Inspection Committee.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Polutov] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok, 10 Mar -- TOKYO SHIMBUN is the first 
foreign news organization to be allowed to report on a 
dismantling plant for nuclear-powered submarines in the Russian 
Far East. This plant is known to be the source of radioactive 
waste dumped into the Japan Sea last October, and we were 
allowed to take photos of submarines being dismantled. The 
plant was filled with about 300 containers of solid nuclear 
waste, and it was obvious the plant's storage capacity was 
reaching its limits. 
  Last month, Russia refused to accept the new London 
Convention, which prohibits the dumping of any radioactive waste 
into the sea. The submarine dismantling plant is facing 
difficulties in continuing its operations due to a surplus of 
radioactive waste. Therefore, the plant is calling for the 
resumption of dumping of radioactive waste. 
  "Zvezda (Star)" plant is located in Borshoy-Kamen Bay, 120 
kilometers east of Vladivostok. The plant was founded in 1954 
as a dock for warships and submarines, but is currently 
dismantling superannuated nuclear-powered submarines which were 
scrapped one after another during the past several years. 
  Unauthorized entry to the plant is strictly forbidden, and 
the gate is guarded by security authorities. The plant is 
divided into A and B zones, and when this correspondent visited 
the facility, a "Delta-1" class (displacement: 9,000 tons) was 
being disassembled in A zone. Both the bow and the stern of the 
Delta-1 were sliced off, and the body was placed in a dock as if 
it were a huge sausage. Its missile launcher used to be a great 
threat to the Western nations, but it has now been reduced to a 
pile of scrap iron. Compared to the beautifully streamlined 
shapes of Russian submarines, of which this correspondent is 
familiar, the heap of scrap iron looked miserable. 
  Director Maslakov said that the Zvezda plant had already 
dismantled five nuclear submarines. He added that the plant 
currently has four submarines to dismantle, but two of them are 
still untouched. 
  Since the Russian Pacific Fleet has discontinued its dumping 
of solid nuclear waste from 1990, about 300 containers (with a 
capacity of 1.5 cubic meters each) of solid nuclear waste have 
been stored in the plant. The dumping of liquid nuclear waste 
was also suspended last fall due to criticism from the 
international community. The liquid waste tankers "TNT-5" and 
"TNT-27" were moored at a pier near the plant, but they were 
said to be full of liquid waste. 
  Explaining the seriousness of the current situation, 
Director 
Maslakov stated: "This plant is just like a man without a 
kidney. The dismantling of nuclear submarines cannot continue 
without the disposal of nuclear waste. If the plant stops its 
operations, the Pacific Fleet would become unable to carry on 
its normal duties, which may cause social unrest." 
  To say nothing of the budget to build new disposal 
facilities, the plant cannot afford to pay wages to its 
employees. Director Maslakov said "the resumption of nuclear 
waste dumping is inevitable unless Japan and other Western 
nations offer funds for constructing (nuclear waste disposal 
facilities)."

  [Text] The Pacific Fleet's liquid nuclear wastes (LNW) will 
be safely stored or processed before the end of 1994. Nikolay 
Bisovko, a senior official in the Federal Supervision of Nuclear 
and Radioactive Security, who looks after the safety of nuclear 
power plants used by the country's defense agencies, told 
Interfax that a mobile LNW processing unit would be built in the 
Maritime Territory at a cost of 1.2 Bn [billion] rubles. "We 
believe that it will be assembled in three to four months and 
become operational in 1994," he said. 
  He added that a stationary processing unit had to be 
constructed in the area. The unit will need filters and other 
parts that will have to be manufactured in numerous factories. 
  Bisovko thinks said that an ecological study would precede 
the construction of stationary LNW processing units. It was 
hard to say at this stage how much time and funds would be 
required for that project.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France To Sell off Nuclear Power </F>
Group"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] The French Government have launched the process of 
privatising FRAMATOME, the nuclear power station group. 
FRAMATOME, which also has activities in computer services and 
electronic components, is not on the list of 21 publicly-owned 
groups which the centre-right Government has slated for 
privatisation. It will be sold through a limited tender offer. 
The likely candidates to take a controlling stake in the group 
include ALCATEL-ALSTHOM, the engineering, transport and 
communications group, which already holds 44 percent of the 
shares. In 1990, ALCATEL-ALSTHOM briefly managed to acquire a 
majority stake in FRAMATOME, raising its investment from 40 
percent to 52 percent. FRAMATOME was formed in 1958 to design 
and build light pressurised water reactors and nuclear 
components. It has since diversified and expanded sales to more 
than FF12 billion a year. 
  In 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, it 
reported net profits of FF900 million.

<F P=106> [Article by Bradford Smith: "Budget Boost for Critical </F>
Issues"] 
  [Text] A shift of research priorities but no more total 
money is the dominant characteristic of the 1994 budget of 
France's atomic energy commission, the CEA. At 18.98 billion 
French francs [Fr] (2.15 billion pounds), the new budget is just 
1.2 percent above the 1993 figure of Fr18.76 billion -- less 
than inflation. 
  In keeping with worldwide trends, the proportion of CEA 
funding coming from military sources is falling, although both 
military and civilian funding from government agencies show 
slight increases, at Fr8.85 billion (+0.9 percent) and Fr6.54 
billion (+1.6 percent) respectively. Funding from external 
sources, such as contract work for the nuclear industry, is up 
2.5 percent to Fr3.56 billion. 
  Of Fr10 billion for civilian projects, Fr8.57 billion is 
devoted to research and Fr317 million to teaching, education and 
international collaboration. The remainder will meet financial 
needs such as interest charges and anticipated retirements. 
  Nuclear-related research now accounts for 59.6 percent of 
the 
1994 budget (58 percent in 1993), with pressurized water reactor 
(PWR) safety (Fr509 million), laser enrichment (Fr447 million) 
and the renewal of civilian power plant installations (Fr566 
million) as major items. 
  Other allocations reflect the CEA's current strategic aims 
in 
fuel storage and disposal: Research on the separation and 
incineration of actinides and long-lived fusion products (the 
SPIN programme), gets a 20 percent increase to Fr257 million; 
and the CAPRA programme, which is studying the use of fast 
neutron reactors to reduce plutonium stocks, goes up 12 percent 
to Fr217 million. 
  Research into the temporary and long-term storage of 
radioactive waste sees a record rise of 31 percent to Fr134 
million and, in line with the aims of the nuclear industry, 
R&amp;D 
programmes on the next generation of PWRs and on MOX [mixed 
oxide] nuclear fuels also get funding boosts -- up 24 percent 
(to Fr172 million) and 18 percent (to Fr115 million) 
respectively. But all service activities relating to 
engineering and production are to be transferred to the 
industrial sector once they are sufficiently near-market. This 
particularly affects nuclear fuel cycle pilot installations, 
where the budget falls 27 percent to Fr204 million. 
  There is also a dramatic decrease in funding for fast 
neutron 
reactors (FNRs), coinciding with the closure of the European 
Fast Reactor (EFR) programme. The CEA notes with satisfaction 
the technical progress made through the EFR studies and has cut 
the FNR budget by 44 percent to Fr74 million. 
  Nuclear topics allied to the environment, biology and 
health, 
will receive about 10 percent of the total research budget. 
There are substantial increases in several key sectors: About 
10 percent for radiation protection and radiobiology (to Fr188 
million), and Fr133 million for the Protein 2000 programme, 
which aims to study, design and made proteins for medical and 
industrial applications. 
  Materials science gets 14.7 percent of the total budget, 
down 
1 percent from 1993. There are rises of 8 percent for atomic 
physics (to Fr53 million) and 5 percent for fundamental and 
particle physics (to Fr218 million), but a 13 percent cut (to 
Fr468 million) for large-scale facilities. This drop 
corresponds to the slowing down of research at the Saturne 
accelerator in Saclay, the completion of repairs and 
refurbishing at the Institute Latre-Langevin in Grenoble, and 
completion of work at the European Synchrotron Radiation 
Facility, also in Grenoble. Technological development -- a 
major activity at the CEA -- suffers a small drop in budget 
share, from 16.3 percent in 1993 to 15.7 percent. By 
concentrating its efforts on strategic sectors, CEA has found 
increased money for work on integrated circuits and 
micro-systems (+3.6 percent to Fr375 million), photonics and 
electro-optics (+4.5 percent to Fr157 million) and for ionizing 
radiation measurements (+10 percent to Fr61 million). 
  In a final gesture of efficiency, the number of 
administrative staff will be reduced by 250 by the end of 1994 
-- how much money this will save is not revealed in the budget.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- The Chancellor's Office in Bonn has 
partly rejected a report by the news magazine DER SPIEGEL, 
claiming that nuclear material from the former states of the 
Warsaw Pact could get into the hands of Western terrorists. 
"The potential for danger is rising," State Minister Bernd 
Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union), who is responsible for 
the intelligence services, admitted, but he added that, despite 
intensive observation of the market, there have not been any 
signs of a threat by nuclear terrorists. "So far, there is no 
indication at all. Weapons-grade material has not turned up in 
our country at all.... Terrorists do not have access to 
weapons-grade material because it is not available on the 
market," he said in an interview with RTL. 
  "It can still be ruled out that nuclear warheads are 
available in an uncontrolled manner," the newsmagazine quotes a 
report by the Federal Intelligence Office (BND). However, 
referring to the same source, DER SPIEGEL warns that nuclear 
bombs and biological weapons from Eastern Europe could soon be 
in the hands "of Western gangs." 
  In its 18-page report the BND speaks of a "trend toward an 
escalation of the situation." Centers of smuggling include 
Vilnius and Kamas in Lithuania. According to the magazine, the 
FRG has become the hub for nuclear smuggling. Schmidbauer 
explained this by referring to the FRG's geographical location. 
The minister reported that over the past two years 300 to 350 
cases of illegal nuclear trade or smuggling have been registered. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna also 
does not assume that blackmailers will soon have access to 
nuclear weapons. "So far, we have not noticed anything like 
that in our worldwide monitoring," a spokesman said in an 
interview with the private radio station RADIO 7 in Ulm. The 
IAEA has helped the CIS states to establish inspection bodies so 
as to prevent trade of weapons-grade material.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Slight Increase in Armament Exports </F>
from Switzerland -- Malaysia Was the Biggest Customer in 1993"; 
as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 31 Jan (ATS) -- In 1993, arms exports 
increased by 0.5 percent in comparison with the year before, 
from 258.8 million [Swiss] francs (Sf) to Sf260.2 million. 
However, taking inflation into account, the figure represents a 
decrease in real terms, Francois Godet, deputy secretary general 
of the Federal Military Department (DMF), told ATS. 
  Since 1987's record figure (Sf578.3 million), the amount of 
arms exports has fallen each year. Mr. Godet says that this 
downward trend can be explained by the increased arms sales by 
"threshold countries," such as the former Communist countries in 
Eastern Europe. 
<H5>  European Union as the Main Customer </H5>
  In 1993, Switzerland's biggest individual customer was 
Malaysia, with sales amounting to Sf50.7 million. Germany 
ranked second (Sf41.5 million), followed by Saudi Arabia (Sf36.9 
million). From a geographical point of view, the European Union 
is the main purchaser of Swiss arms at Sf79.1 million, followed 
by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both totaling Sf45 
million. 
  Other major customers include Sweden and Singapore (Sf16 
million each), Canada (11.9 million), the United States (Sf8.6 
million), Austria (Sf7.6 million), the Philippines (Sf4.1 
million), the Netherlands (Sf3.8 million), and Brazil (Sf1.4 
million). The smallest customer was Estonia, which spent Sf21 
[as received] for explosives and chemicals for civil use.

<F P=106> [Article by David Leppard, home affairs correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Scotland Yard has uncovered an international plot by 
Bosnian Serbs to buy laser-guided British missiles to attack 
Nato warplanes poised to bomb artillery positions around 
Sarajevo. 
  The operation, a joint effort by the police and MI5, the 
security service, has identified a conspiracy by a Serb 
middleman and a British arms dealer from Kingston, Surrey, to 
buy missiles worth about &pound;1m on the black market in London. 
  The success of the operation, codenamed Porchester, will 
come 
as a relief to Nato pilots and United Nations peacekeeping 
forces in the besieged city, where the chances of bombing raids 
receded last night after the Serbs appeared to be meeting UN 
demands to withdraw artillery. 
  Scotland Yard has declined to comment, but intelligence 
sources said the two men were monitored at meetings in London 
and the home counties as they tried to buy eight Starburst 
missiles from an unidentified man, thought to be a British arms 
dealer with links to organised crime. 
  Starburst is a shoulder-fired, laser-guided system 
manufactured by Shorts of Belfast. First unveiled at the 1991 
Paris air show, it boasts a two-and-a-half-mile range and can be 
fired within seconds. Shorts sales' literature boasts that 
Starburst "can be brought into action and fired as soon as enemy 
aircraft have been identified -- and before the release of their 
weapons". 
  The missile is said to be immune to electronic jamming, 
flares or chaff, and would undoubtedly have posed a threat to 
allied warplanes, including RAF Tornadoes and Harriers. A 
successor to the Javelin missile system, it is used by the 
British Army. 
  Security sources say the Serb middleman described himself as 
"the procurements officer" for the government of Slovenia, a 
province of the former Yugoslavia and now an independent country 
uninvolved in the civil war. 
  The middleman is a well known Yugoslav-born arms dealer in 
his late thirties who lives near Vancouver in western Canada. He 
has been under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) since last year. The international operation 
also involved American customs and Canadian and Israeli 
intelligence. 
  The middleman was tracked to meetings at Hilton hotels in 
London's Park Lane and near Bushey, Hertfordshire. At one 
meeting he was shown a missile, worth &pound;100,000 on the black 
market, and a shoulder launcher. The combined unit was offered 
for sale for about &pound;180,000; the Serb said he wanted to buy 
eight missiles. 
  He arranged to have the money transferred from a Swiss bank 
account in Zurich to a branch of Credit Suisse in London. It is 
understood he planned to smuggle the weapons to Serbia on a 
plane from Heathrow. 
  Detectives from Scotland Yard's international and organised 
crime branch, SO1, have contacted the defence ministry in an 
attempt to find out how the missiles reached the London arms 
black market. Last year, 120 tonnes of weapons were seized in 
Slovenia in what UN investigators claim was a plot to breach the 
arms embargo to forces fighting the civil war. 
  Operation Porchester is the latest example of joint action 
by 
police and MI5 in the growing war against international crime 
and arms trafficking. Although they are confident they have 
broken the plan to buy the missiles, the two men are still at 
large.

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F>
"Proposals for a New Policy Framework for Control of Hazardous 
Chemicals."] 
  [Text] Environment Minister Robert Atkins today welcomed 
the publication of a discussion document outlining proposals for 
a new framework for the assessment and control of hazardous 
substances. 
  Announcing the publication of the Discussion Paper, Mr. 
Atkins said: 
  "The paper seeks to develop a transparent and coherent 
strategy for identifying and controlling chemicals which are 
particularly dangerous to the environment, especially those 
released from diffuse sources. The proposed strategy is based on 
internationally accepted criteria for assessing the risks to 
human health and the environment and advocates a measured 
approach to the control of these risks. 
  "Our objective is to build upon existing programmes and 
measures, so that we remain consistent in our approach and 
minimise the burdens on the public sector and industry. 
  "The proposed new policy framework is a response to the 
challenges the Government established in the UK Strategy for 
Sustainable Development. It also aims to meet two objectives of 
the Governments deregulation initiative - greater clarity in the 
operation of environmental regulations and the consideration of 
viable alternatives to regulatory action which maintain existing 
environmental standards." 
<H5>  Notes To Editors </H5>
  The Discussion Paper - Reducing Emissions of Hazardous 
Chemicals to the Environment was released today for public 
consultation. Its publication fulfils a commitment made in the 
Sustainable Development Strategy. 
  The paper describes a new policy framework for reducing 
diffuse emissions of hazardous substances to the environment. It 
consists of a discussion paper supported by several annexes. 
  The discussion paper considers components of the proposed 
new 
framework in a stepwise manner beginning with criteria for 
identifying environmentally hazardous chemicals. The proposed 
criteria are intended to be consistent with those used in other 
UK substance based policy initiatives. This is followed by an 
outline of the principles of Risk Assessment; a vital component 
of the proposed strategy designed to inform decisions as to the 
extent of risk posed by a particular chemical and the degree of 
control necessary to manage the risk effectively. The paper then 
discusses a proposed hierarchy of measures to control chemical 
risks. Alternatives to regulatory control are considered 
including voluntary agreements with industry and economic 
instruments. 
  The supporting annexes provide detailed information on 
typical point and diffuse sources of emissions of hazardous 
chemicals and many of the existing control measures including 
international initiatives such as the Montreal Protocol and the 
Oslo and Paris Conventions. Technical guidance on priority 
setting and risk characterisation for hazardous chemicals is 
also provided. 
  The Government is seeking responses to the proposed strategy 
and related issues by the 31st May 1994.

<F P=106> [Article: "Sellafield Takes First Cargo of Spent Fuel"] </F>
  [Text] An important step towards the recycling of spent 
nuclear fuel from Britain, Japan, Germany and other overseas 
customers was taken in the early hours of yesterday with the 
commissioning of the Thorp operation at Sellafield, Cumbria. 
  Employees of British Nuclear Fuels began filling a channel 
with 600,000 litres of demineralised water, linking spent fuel 
storage ponds with ones that feed the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing 
Plant. 
  The company said that the first consignment of spent fuel, a 
three-tonne container from the advanced gas cooled reactors of 
Heysham and Hinkley Point power stations, would be moved on a 
special underwater machine at the end of the week. Reprocessing 
would begin after checks on the moving equipment. 
  Greenpeace and Lancashire County Council last week secured 
the right to a judicial review of the Government's decision to 
approve Thorp's operation. It will take place early next month 
-- probably before the first fuel rods are reprocessed. 
  John Guinness, chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, said 
yesterday: "Today is a watershed. It means at last that Thorp is 
finally opening. This is good news not only for our company and 
our workforce, who have worked tirelessly for this day over the 
last 16 years, but also for our customers who have supported the 
plant." He said he was confident that the company would secure a 
successful result in the judicial review.

<F P=106> [Report by Baha'-al-Din Yahyawi in Prague; all names as </F>
published] 
  [Text] The nuclear road between Prague and Tehran is clear. 
Western intelligence services have, over the past three months, 
monitored the movements of Iranians carrying suitcases and 
wearing lightweight shoes in the Czech capital. The visitors 
turned out to be the men running Iran's nuclear program. Notable 
among these are Seyyed 'Ata ollah Mohajerani, who works on the 
nuclear cell attached to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. At the 
same time as the giant Skoda company's factories on the 
outskirts of Prague were being sold to the private sector, 
Iranians rushed to buy shares, particularly in the company's 
nuclear operations. To that end, they set up a network of 
agents, a majority of whom became active in the "Iraqi lobby' in 
the communist era. The mullahs are in the market for technology 
for their nuclear sites. What are the secrets of the nuclear 
network operating between Prague and Tehran? 
  From early September to mid-January, Western intelligence 
services were struck by the unusual movement of Iranian 
delegations in Prague and an increase in the staff of the 
Iranian Embassy there. American, Arab, and European monitors 
were convinced that the Iranians arriving in the Czech capital 
were pursuing contacts and nuclear and arms deals. Such was 
their conviction that an Arab military attache sent a report to 
his superiors saying "the Czech Republic is on its way to 
becoming a main conduit for advanced western technology to Iran, 
specifically in the fields of military electronics and nuclear 
knowhow." 
  Hence, the successive visits to Prague over the past three 
months by Iranian officials responsible for their country's 
nuclear program. The last such visit to be noted was the one 
led by Haj 'Azimi, deputy head of the Atomic Energy Authority, 
assisted by an "adviser" living outside Iran, who has been well 
versed with Iran's nuclear program since the days of the shah. 
'Azimi was once in charge of the Iranian Energy Corporation. 
It was he who signed the first agreement with the West German 
firm Kraft Werkers Union - K.W.U -- [preceding acronym in Latin 
letters] to build two reactors -- one in Bushehr, 60 km from the 
port, the second, 1,200 megawatt strong, in Ahvaz. After that 
nuclear mission, a delegation representing "Iranian military 
industries" came to Prague seeking a radar monitoring system of 
the "Tamara" type, one of the most efficient and sophisticated 
of its kind in the world, intended for detecting airborne 
objects flying at an altitude as high as 250-300 km. According 
to Czech sources, Tamara can spot airborne objects that other 
traditional radar systems find hard to detect and track down. 
They cite such targets as the small-size cruise missiles that 
fly at an altitude almost so low as to touch the ground, the 
Stealth fighters developed by Washington to blind radar systems, 
including the "F-117" used extensively against Iraq during the 
Gulf war, and the new strategic B-3" bombers, introduced into 
the U.S. Air Force recently. 
  In the second week of January, 1994, what was dubbed by 
surveillance services "the largest Iranian nuclear delegation to 
visit the Czech capital" arrived in Prague. It comprised Amer 
Ollahi, the official in charge of the Nuclear Power Authority in 
Iran, Mehdi Shemran, a nuclear physicist from the Californian 
Berkley University, who is also a prominent official of the 
"Vavak" agency, who, in late 1991, negotiated the purchase of 
three nuclear warheads with Kazakhstan authorities in Alma-Ata. 
The extraordinary delegation also comprised Seyyed 'Ata ollah 
Mohajerani, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's adviser for nuclear 
affairs. They sought to put the finishing touches on a deal of 
nuclear components and technoloy, the draft of which had been 
negotiated by Mansur Haj 'Azimi and an adviser living in a 
European capital under the guise of an opponent to the mullahs 
regime. Various sources repored that the Iranians were 
interested in completing the Bushehr reactor, on which work was 
begun by the Munich-based Kraft Werkers Union firm, which is a 
subsidiary of the giant Siemens company. Mohajerani asked the 
"Skoda Energy" firm to go through with the project at the 
projected cost of billions of dollars. 
  This Czech firm is known to be part of the "Skoda Concern", 
and is now undergoing privatization. Tehran may have offered to 
become a shareholder in the company, as the final profile of the 
distribution of its equity is yet to take shape. However, the 
biggest three potential shareholders are the German Siemens, the 
French Framathone and the American Westinghouse, in addition to 
the company's director general Dr. "Souskek", a prominent 
ex-communist in Prague. It is now established that Mohajerani 
sought 30 percent of the "Skoda Energy" shares in a barter deal 
involving oil shipments of up to half a million barrels every 
three months. The Iranians also showed an interest in purchasing 
equity in a number of Czech arms manufacturing firms. According 
to reliable information, a deal to buy [baqdami] iron fell 
through. The Czechs insisted on being paid in a basket of hard 
currencies. The two sides agreed that the Iranians visit Prague 
again in mid- February, on the eve of the announcement of Iran's 
budget for the new Iranian year beginning 21 March, which 
earmarks several billions of dollars to nuclear facilities and 
their six secret locations. Most likely the delegation will be 
made up of Mohajerani, Mansur Haj 'Azimi, and advisers. 
  Sources contacted by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI are unanimous that 
the Czech Government, in order to avoid dealing directly with 
the nuclear mullahs, has authorized the director general of 
"Skoda Energy" to do the talking with the Iranians and work out 
an agreement with them, with the assistance of Vratislav 
Lopovoski, the man responsible for the commercial section at the 
Radiation Company [al-sharikah al-mushi'ah], who is well known 
to Iranian politicians. Also joining the talks overtly or 
covertly are establishments specialized in the manufacture of 
nuclear components, including the "P.B.S" and the "CKD" which 
were taken over weeks ago by the French "Elstom" company through 
its "Sougilik" branch specializing in the supply of electric 
power to reactors and the reactors' security and safety. Also 
taking part in the negotiations is the "ZVU" firm, formerly the 
"Skoda Moravia" which manufactures military equipment used in 
the production of chemical and germ weapons. Another firm 
joining the effort is the "Centizia" which produces the "Semtex" 
explosive. 
  The Americans and Europeans are alarmed at the prospect of 
Iran acquiring equity in these factories that are being 
auctioned off. They note that, over a 30-year period, these 
factories turned out weapons of the highest caliber for the 
Soviet bloc. Influential members of Iran's National Security 
Council -- the highest military decisionmaking body in the land 
-- believe that these Czech factories, which Prague finds itself 
unable to operate for lack of hard currencies, fit the 
requirements of Iran's nuclear and armament program. It is 
interesting that Iran has spread a network of agents, spies, and 
informers in Prague. The Iranians are said to have recruited 
dynamic members of the "Iraqi lobby" that were active in the 
Czech capital during the eighties. That lobby, made up of local 
and foreign agents and politicians and military personnel, went 
into a state of "hibernation" after 1990. With the invasion of 
Kuwait, members of that lobby became jobless. They formerly 
served in the K.G.B. and its arms and all of a sudden found they 
had no role to play. Faced with the Iranian "bait", they 
offered their services to Iran's nuclear program. If the 
behind-the-scenes negotiations produce a happy ending, as seems 
likely, given an Iranian preparedness to meet all the financial 
conditions, Iran will shortly take delivery of two reactors of 
1,200 megawatt capacity each for the Bushehr location. Thus, as 
the major shareholders in "Skoda", German firms will, through 
the back door of Prague, have a stake in the Iranian nuclear 
program. 
  A Western diplomatic report of limited circulation has 
indicated that Iran recently received special equipment for the 
935-megawatt Darkhovin reactor. A Czech firm that works as a 
front for a major European establishment delivered the equipment 
to Iran. So far the goods are still in their boxes. The only 
obstacle hampering the unpacking is the European technicians, 
who were scheduled to have arrived at the Darkhovin site, have 
been slow in arriving due to bargains being conducted in back 
channels. Israel stepped onto the scene, further complicating 
the issue because of the difficult conditions entailed. It has 
been reported that the Iranians are seeking the laser technology 
required for the enrichment of uranium so that more thorough 
research can be conducted at Tehran University. This plan is 
part of a program to establish a nuclear technology base that 
would subsequently facilitate the acquisition of nuclear 
capability. Some Western surveillance sources expect that 1995 
will be the year that Iran will manufacture its own nuclear 
bomb. The Carnegie Foundation has revealed that Tehran has made 
tangible advances in its quest to acquire various kinds of 
nuclear technology equipment and extract fuel from uranium. 
Sayrafi is an Iranian nuclear scientist who has, for several 
years, been working at an atomic laboratory in a certain 
European capital. Before that, he worked at the Iranian Nuclear 
Energy Organization for a long time during the shah's rule. He 
has indicated that Tehran invested some 5.5 billion German 
marks, an amount equal to $3.73 billion, in the Bushehr project 
started by the K.W.U. firm, an affiliate of the German Siemens 
Company, in 1975. 
  In his last visit to Tehran, Heinrick von Perrere, the 
Siemens director, told the Islamic Republic News Agency that the 
Bushehr story is regrettable. It embarrassed the Siemens 
workers, as well as the Iranians, he added. He went on to say 
that this story should not be an obstacle to future trade deals. 
  That is why the Iranians created the Czech back channel to 
circumvent U.S. bans and other regulations the Westerners 
spelled out in Bonn in May, 1993. These bans and regulations 
prohibited sensitive technology supplies from being transferred 
to Iran. However, not everyone's interests are served by 
compliance with these bans, especially when the mullas express a 
readiness to foot their bills in cash and on time. 
  Those well versed in the mullas' quest to obtain nuclear 
technology have cited authorizations to spend limitlessly on 
efforts to obtain nuclear technology by the highest echelon of 
power in Tehran, regardless of the crisis pertaining to oil 
revenues. These authorizations coincided with the first test 
firing of a long-range 1,100 km missile that is capable of 
carrying a nuclear warhead in the desert of Tabas. Chinese and 
DPRK experts attended the test firing of the missile.

<F P=106> [Article signed ME/PI: "Bale: Three Federal Councillors </F>
Present at Opening of Muba 94"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Excerpt] Bale, 4 Mar (ATS) -- The Muba, the most important 
public trade fair in Switzerland, opened on Friday. Three 
federal councillors attended the opening. For 10 days more than 
1,400 exhibitors will display their services and products in 
seven distinct sectors. The special presentations this year are 
dedicated to AIDS, civil protection, radioactive waste, and 
rational energy use. 
  Federal Councillors Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, Arnold Koller, 
and 
Swiss President Otto Stich attended the first day of Muba 1994. 
Among the people invited were Lonnart Meri, president of the 
Republic of Estonia; Mario Frick, head of the Liechtenstein 
Government; Gret Haller, president of the Swiss National 
Council; and Riccardo Jagmetti, president of the Swiss State 
Council. 
  [Public Economic Councillor] Jean-Pascal Delamuraz delivered 
a speech in which he said: "There is hope of a modest recovery, 
but we should also be aware that the economic recovery will not 
have an immediate affect on the labor market." He reminded his 
audience that the parliament will have to decide this autumn on 
whether to accept the new GATT agreements. These agreements, he 
said, are "good and even indispensable for Switzerland, but they 
will not perform miracles." They are aimed at entrepreneurs and 
"bold" workers, and are not "for the faint-hearted." 
<H5>  Fifteen Trading Partners </H5>
  This year, Muba is acting as host to 15 trading partners. 
Estonia, Kenya, the DPRK, and the region of Offenburg/Mid-Baden 
(Germany) are represented for the first time. The other guest 
countries are India, Mongolia, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, the 
Slovak Republic, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Czech republic, 
Hungary, and the French region of Vosges. [passage omitted)

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Akira Kato: "North Korea Already Has </F>
Nuclear Weapons -- Classified Document of the Russian Defense 
Ministry Obtained"] 
  [Text] The international community has suspected North 
Korea of developing nuclear weapons and I recently obtained a 
document decisively proving that it already possesses nuclear 
weapons. The document is a formal report compiled by the Russian 
Government which long helped North Korea develop nuclear 
technology. 
  The document is entitled: "The Russian Federation's Basic 
Military and Political Concept on the Current Military Situation 
in the Asian and Pacific Region." 
  The document is a classified report that was compiled on 22 
October 1993 by the Russian Federation's Defense Ministry for 
Defense Minister Grachev. 
  The report, compiled by the Military Strategy Research 
Center 
under the General Staff of the Armed Forces, was also submitted 
to the Russian Government leaders. According to information I 
have obtained, the report has been sent to the U.S. Defense 
Department at President Yeltsin's instruction. In other words, 
the report is not a highly classified document. As the title 
indicates, the report proposes Russia's strategic blueprint for 
entire Asia. What draws our attention in the report is North 
Korea's nuclear development. It devotes five pages out of 36 to 
North Korea's nuclear development. 
  The report gives a general picture of North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  It says: "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DARK] 
has announced its decision to pull out of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the DPRK has test-fired 
medium-range ballistic missiles. It has also refused to allow 
nuclear inspections by the committee of the international atomic 
organization [name as received]. These moves by the DPRK have 
heightened the potentially tense situation in the region." 
  The report also indicates that North Korea's threat to the 
security of Russia, the United States, and Japan is drastically 
growing. 
  What is of great interest to the Japanese is a section on 
page 20 of the report. The section was written about North 
Korea's nuclear development for senior officers of the General 
Staff of the Armed Forces and Russian Government leaders. 
  The section entitled "Technology Information" says: Now, 
nine 
people with Russian citizenship are working as nuclear 
physicists in North Korea. Seventeen experts are working on the 
missile manufacturing technology and four of them recently 
returned to their countries. 
  Soviet experts were most active in North Korea in the later 
half of the 1980's. At that time, North Korea was engaged in 
developing Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missile with direct 
assistance of the Soviet Union. The Nodong-1 weighs 1,000-1,500 
kg with a warhead tipped. The missile has a range of 
1,000-1,600 km with a 100-200 meter margin of hit probability. 
Its explosive warhead ranges from one to two megatons. The 
warhead is of the Hiroshima type. The missile flies at the 
maximum speed of more than Mach nine and tipping the missile 
with nuclear warheads is in the final stage. 
  At the same time, North Korea is developing Nodong-2. The 
major task for North Korea is to improve the performance of the 
Nodong-2 -- extension of range and miniaturization of warheads. 
  According to the report, North Korea now has 10-12 kg of 
uranium-235 and 20 kg of plutonium-239. According to Russian 
nuclear experts, they are enough to manufacture three to five 
nuclear warheads. The massive nuclear complex is located in 
Yongbyun, 90 km north of Pyongyang. The Soviet Union provided 
North Korea with a centrifugal separator which is capable of 
greatly increasing the effect of enriched uranium. 
  The report describes North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development as in the "final stage" which has attracted 
attention of the American and European journalists and the 
world. Since the report is an official document that the Russian 
military, which continued to help North Korea's nuclear 
development, compiled on the basis of interviews with Russian 
engineers who returned home from North Korea, it is 100 percent 
reliable. 
  In an interview with me, a senior officer with the Military 
Strategy Research Center under the General Staff of the Armed 
Forces, which compiled the report, gave details of North Korea's 
nuclear development. In the interview, he revealed not only the 
existence of nuclear arms in North Korea, but fearful facts. The 
following are questions and answers: 
  Unidentified officer: "In my view, nuclear 
inspections are a ridiculous story. North Korea has already 
completed the development of Hiroshima-type atomic bomb and it 
is widely known among us that North Korea has at least one 
atomic bomb. The North Koreans are using Russian scientists to 
promote the manufacturing of a few atomic bombs according to the 
`Nuclear Development Project' which they have worked out on 
their own. Perhaps they have already completed manufacturing 
them." 
  "According to an analysis by Soviet nuclear physicists in 
1992, it was said that North Korea was promoting a plan designed 
to produce at least three atomic bombs, similar to the atomic 
bomb dropped on Hiroshima, by the end of 1994. Therefore, it is 
highly possible that they have already finished building a bomb 
or two." 
  Kato: What makes you so positive? 
  Unidentified officer: "It is a matter of common 
knowledge that the former Soviet government supplied low level 
radioactive materials to the north. However, North Koreans are 
enriching these materials and producing high-grade uranium and 
plutonium by using centrifugal separators, which the former 
Soviet Union gave to North Korea, at an underground nuclear 
reprocessing plant in Yongbyun. Moreover, it was confirmed that 
there are several rich uranium veins in the north. 
  In the past, the Soviet Union provided North Korea with 
uranium mining knowhow and technicians as well. The Soviet 
Union did all that for smooth promotion of nuclear development 
in North Korea. Because of the help from the Soviet Union, the 
north now has 20 kilograms of plutonium. Roughly speaking, it 
is possible to make one nuclear warhead if you have eight 
kilograms of plutonium. Judging from the quantity of plutonium 
they have, I do not think my view is far from the truth. 
However, we know the details and actual conditions of the 
development program because we have interviewed scientists who 
came back from there." 
  Kato: But, Russia is officially saying it is not 
supporting North Korean nuclear development. 
  Unidentified officer: "That is right but the fact 
is different. As is written in the report, Russian technicians 
are engaged in North Korean nuclear development. They get paid 
$3,000 or $4,000 per month. In addition, they are given high 
quality houses, cars, clothes, and other daily necessities. 
They are given special treatment. The total number of Russian 
technicians, who were sent to North Korea, was well over 100. 
However, some of them are not coming back. They are staying 
there and obtaining North Korean citizenship and changing their 
names. Now, you understand that the scientists were not ordered 
by the government to go to Pyongyang. We know all about their 
movements, including the number of scientists who emigrated to 
third nations after they went to Pyongyang." 
  Kato: According to a news report, it is said the 
Nodong-1 will be deployed soon. Is that true? 
  Unidentified officer: "After the experimental 
launching of the Nodong-1 in the Sea of Japan on 29 May last 
year, several missiles, including a new remote control system 
which was successfully produced, were sold to Iran. However, 
judging from this fact, there is no doubt that North Korea is 
steadily perfecting its missile development." 
  He also disclosed surprising facts. 
  "Currently, North Korea has three different kinds of 
missiles, which are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. They 
are Scud-A, B and C types which were manufactured in the north 
under a production license, and they have 300 such missiles in 
all. The missile, called Nodong in Japan, is called Tsurudo [as 
published] in Russia. Its capabilities are written in the 
report. However, what we should pay attention to is the 
Nodong-2, which North Korea is developing as a weapon to replace 
Nodong-1. Reportedly, the flight range of the Nodong-2 is 6,000 
kilometers. Therefore, we can say it is a real intercontinental 
ballistic missile [ICBM]. Of course, it will be capable of 
attacking not only the entire Asian region but also part of the 
United States." 
  Kato: Just a minute. Why does North Korea need an 
ICBM? 
  Unidentified officer: "We do not know that for 
sure. However, we can take a guess. Probably, the Gulf War 
became a motive. That is because Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il 
saw Tomahawk's attack the Iraqi military with pinpoint accuracy 
during the war and clearly realized that North Korea will 
immediately suffer crushing blows once it engages in a war. 
They do not need to develop missiles which have the same 
capabilities as American rockets. However, I suppose they 
immediately started to develop the Nodong-2, feeling the need to 
own an ICBM to use as a long-range assault weapon." 
  Kato: Does that mean the Gulf war made North 
Korea change its missile development plan? Do you have some 
concrete evidence? 
  Unidentified officer: "Of course. Previously, 
North Korea was using a liquid fuel method for all of its 
missile development. However, the Gulf war revealed that this 
method had a fatal defect. It was proved that missile bases, no 
matter how well they are hidden underground, are helpless 
against cruise missile attacks as long as their locations are 
known. 
  "For that reason, Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il have 
reportedly made an urgent decision to develop solid-fuel-type 
rockets like the SCUD missiles developed by Iraq. It is safe to 
say that their decision is proved by the fact that the North has 
recently asked the Russian Defense Ministry, through the Moscow 
Embassy in North Korea, to provide it with more advanced missile 
development technology, including know-how on developing 
solid-fuel-type missiles. Whatever the case may be, North 
Korea's demands concerning ICBM development technology are 
persistent and urgent." 
  "For that reason, Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il have 
reportedly made an urgent decision to develop solid-fuel-type 
rockets like the SCUD missiles developed by Iraq. It may be 
safe to say that their decision is proved by the fact that the 
North has recently asked the Russian Defense Ministry through 
the Moscow Embassy in North Korea to provide it with more 
advanced missile development technology, including know-how of 
developing missiles with the solid fuel type method. Whatever 
the case may be, North Korea's demand concerning ICBM 
development technology is persistent and urgent." 
  If what the senior officer said is true, not only Japan but 
also all other nations will be exposed to the nuclear threat of 
Kim Il- song. In fact, reportedly, the United States and 
Russia, fearing North Korea's suspected nuclear development, 
have already started preparing for the North Korean threat. 
  Actually, the senior officer said the report described above 
has been written on the assumption that the world will be 
exposed to North Korea's nuclear threat. 
  As he said, the report emphasizes that Japan, the United 
States, and Russia should jointly cope with the North Korean 
threat. 
  The following are the major points of the report: 
  1) Within the Russian military authorities, there are some 
groups cooperating with North Korea in nuclear development. 
  2) It is impossible to ensure the future security of Russia 
without joint cooperation with Japan, the United States, and 
South Korea. 
  3) Should the military authorities cooperate with North 
Korea, it would double Japan's and South Korea's distrust of 
Russia. Therefore, in view of ensuring security, it is extremely 
dangerous to cooperate with North Korea. 
  4) In particular, Russia's relations with Japan are 
important 
to improving its relations with the United States, and Russia 
should not incite Japan. 
  5) Russia's plan to establish a regional missile 
interception 
network in cooperation with the United States and Japan is for 
regional defense purposes. Therefore, it is absurd to cooperate 
with North Korea in nuclear development. 
  In conclusion, the report even proposes that the outflow to 
North Korea of Russian experts for missile development, of 
materials for missile development, and nuclear resources should 
be prevented; that an accord between Russia and North Korea on 
missile development technology should be abolished; and that 
Russia should not help North Korea smuggle its missiles to the 
third countries. 
  The senior officer also disclosed another astonishing fact. 
  He said: "Concerned over the threat of North Korea, 
including 
nuclear attack in the Far East and the Pacific region, Japan's 
Defense Agency, the Russian Defense Ministry, and the U.S. 
Department of Defense are conducting meetings to seek a possible 
tripartite emergency defense system aimed at coping with a North 
Korean missile attack. 
  "Particularly, they have agreed that it is necessary to 
urgently come up with measures to deal with ICBM missiles which 
North Korea is developing secretly. 
  "As far as I know, when the summit was held, (then) Director 
General of the Defense Agency Nakanishi, who accompanied Prime 
Minister Hosokawa on his visit to Vancouver, reportedly met with 
a high-raking official of the U.S. Department of Defense and 
obtained information on progress in North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  "Meanwhile, a high-ranking Japanese Defense Agency official 
visited Moscow, and his visit was briefly reported by ITAR-TASS 
saying a meeting was held between Japanese and Russian defense 
officials. However, in fact, at the meeting, in-depth 
discussions were held on such topics as progress in North 
Korea's nuclear development, and its strike capability. 
  "At the meeting, they agreed to hold a Japan-Russia meeting 
of defense officials in Tokyo around February 1994 (recently the 
meeting was scheduled for 1-2 February). When the meeting is 
held, Russia will bring a more detailed, precise report on North 
Korea's military power. Actually, the Military Strategy 
Research Center has been ordered to work out a report needed for 
the meeting." 
  It is true that former Director-General of the Defense 
Agency 
Nakanishi was eager to develop a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) 
system jointly with the United States. It is also true that 
after Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to the United States for 
the summit meeting, Japanese ministries and agencies concerned 
with North Korean issues have started seriously studying 
possible economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  I think it is time for the Japanese Government to tell the 
people about how nuclear bombs and missiles are being developed 
by North Korea because the North Korean issue directly affects 
the future security of Japan. Meanwhile, the government is 
seeking a new framework for security. The situation is getting 
serious, and for Japan, this is no time to be carried away by 
"Hosokawa's performance." 
  The senior officer also said: "Russia is not the only 
country 
which provides North Korea with nuclear resources. You probably 
do not know that China has been cooperating with North Korea. 
It has been confirmed that a great volume of uranium has been 
brought in to North Korea only recently. 
  "It is said the source of that uranium is factories in 
Mordai 
[as published] and Choera [as published] in China. If so, 
nuclear material brought in to North Korea must be low-level 
radioactive material. However, if it is so inclined, North 
Korea can collect nuclear development and materials know-how. 
  "What you should not forget is the fact that North Korea 
already has at least one atomic bomb and 1,000-kilometer range 
missiles."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Russian Navy Is Selling Nuclear </F>
Materials to Iran!"] 
  [Text] Iran's secret and open efforts to purchase nuclear 
weapons and obtain nuclear expertise from the nations of the 
former Soviet Union have not ceased. A few days ago Moscow 
witnessed a scandal of significant proportions, which began with 
a radioactive waste crisis between Russia and Japan. This matter 
then developed to the point where it uncovered a huge operation 
involving the smuggling of radioactive waste material to Iran, 
with the participation of the commanders of the Russian navy. 
The initial threads of the scandal led to the uncovering of a 
network of Iranian businessmen who, for some time, had been 
visiting secret nuclear plants, making contacts with scientists, 
and hiring them, and making deals to hasten Iran's nuclear 
program. All of this culminated in Rafsanjani's offering to buy 
all of Kazakhstan's nuclear arsenal, including a testing ground 
which would be reassembled in Iran in order that Iran begin its 
first efforts in nuclear testing. What exactly happened, and 
what are the details of the latest nuclear deal between Russia, 
the former Soviet republics, and Iran? 
  On 17 November 1993, a sea patrol belonging to the 
international environmental protection organization known as 
"Green Peace" spotted a Russian TNT-27 oil tanker, flying the 
flag of the Russian Pacific Fleet, dumping radioactive waste, 
which was said to be non-concentrated, in the ocean in a place 
200 miles off the shore of Japan. Russian military maps call 
this place "Area 9." The thing which attracted the attention of 
the Green Peace people was that the Russian ship stopped dumping 
the radioactive waste as soon as the Green Peace ship approached 
it, although analyses of the water did not indicate that it 
contained a high proportion of nuclear materials. This matter 
caused a crisis between Russia and Japan, and the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs hastened to apologize to Japan while 
high-ranking government leadership, represented by Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, hastened to pacify Tokyo by 
declaring a ban on the disposal by the Pacific Fleet of 
radioactive waste materials in the Sea of Japan. The scandal was 
then considered to be closed and over with, although Admiral 
Igor Kasatonov, the second-highest commander of Russia's naval 
forces, said that such procedures were inevitable because the 
system utilized by the ships require them, and he added that 
these materials do not harm the water as far as the environment 
and human beings are concerned. 
  But AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that the Russian Ministry 
of Security has been monitoring some feverish activity being 
carried out by a group of persons and establishments which have 
long been interested in the export of concentrated nuclear 
materials and scrap that can be utilized by plants that use 
nuclear materials -- export which takes place without licenses, 
according to Aleksandr Mikhailov, spokesman for the Ministry of 
Security. In other words, there is a lot of talk going on about 
the smuggling of these materials. This is something that is big 
business in present-day Russia, which has adopted the principle 
of earning profits above all else. 
  Colonel Aleksandr Mikhailov made public a report prepared by 
one of the departments in the Russian Foreign Intelligence 
Service [SVRR], which was tasked with monitoring the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The report was submitted 
to the head of the SVRR, Yevgeniy Primakov, on the eve of his 
meeting with the head of the CIA in Washington, D.C., in June of 
1993. The report confirmed that efforts were being made today to 
smuggle non-concentrated nuclear waste materials utilized by 
industrial sectors and scrap that can be utilized by nuclear 
plants, as well as parts of nuclear warheads that are being 
dismantled in accordance with the treaty to decrease nuclear 
weapons -- not the components of nuclear ammunition -- out of 
Russia. Some of these attempts have been spotted by the security 
forces, whereas others have gotten through "safely." They are 
usually carried out by "amateurs" who cannot imagine how 
dangerous this activity is, even for the businessmen. 
Nevertheless, the intelligence agencies have noticed a rapid 
trend toward the establishment of permanent channels for 
smuggling these materials from Russia to nations which aspire to 
possess nuclear weapons. 
  We should mention that Russia is the only nation among the 
nations of the former Soviet Union that has declared that it is 
monitoring the export of nuclear and strategic materials. 
However, this declaration is nothing more than a piece of paper, 
because there has been no announcement of any practical measures 
that would guarantee translating this declaration into reality. 
As a result, there is plenty of opportunity for the smuggling of 
nuclear materials to take place. 
<H5>  From the Far East to Iran </H5>
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that Russian minister of 
Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin, during his visit to the Far East 
in the summer of 1993, gave the green light to the Pacific Fleet 
command to sell "used nuclear materials and nuclear fuel scrap" 
to other countries. These materials used to be buried in western 
and central Siberia. But the expenses of transporting and 
"burying," which the government was no longer able to control 
after the break-up of the USSR, went up so much that the fleet 
could not keep on shouldering them. So it began selling 
radioactive waste to the "Middle East" via two Argentine 
intermediary companies whose ships took the "scrap" in "Area 9" 
in the Sea of Japan. The Pacific Fleet intelligence agencies 
have information to the effect that four of the two companies' 
ships anchored off the shoreline of Iran, and that this was the 
last stop on their voyages back from the Sea of Japan. Another 
ship escaped the eyes of the intelligence services, while a 
Green Peace patrol frustrated the loading operation of a ship 
from southern Europe that had been rented by one of the two 
intermediary companies. Its captain decided not to approach the 
TNT-27 tanker for fear that the Green Peace observers would spot 
what his ship was carrying and then raise a ruckus, upsetting 
the whole world. For this reason, the Korean ship left "Area 9" 
without having loaded the nuclear "scrap." Then the captain of 
the Russian tanker and the Pacific Fleet command launched an 
attack on Green Peace, accusing them of ordinary piracy. One of 
the officers of the tanker's crew said that, if any of the Green 
Peace rabble had tried to come on board his ship, he would have 
ordered them tossed into the ocean. 
  "Actually," said Aleksandr Mikhailov, "the sailors of the 
Pacific Fleet are giving serious consideration to attempts by 
Green Peace to monitor the movements of ships carrying the flag 
of the Russian naval forces, even if they are supporting ships, 
because this injures their feelings as military people who serve 
their flag, and it deprives them of a `source of income,' 
especially since the Russian Government, represented by Minister 
of Internal Affairs Yerin, has given them permission to earn 
part of their living in this manner." 
  But the most important thing about this scandal is that the 
radioactive liquid nuclear waste, more than likely, is nothing 
but a cover for the basic cargo that the rented Korean ship 
decided not to take. When the file was closed on Japan's 
protests via the Russian prime minister's announcement that he 
was banning, from now on, the "disposal of the Pacific Fleet's 
radioactive liquid scrap" in the Sea of Japan, a dispute broke 
out between the prime minister and the Pacific Fleet command, 
and perhaps the Russian naval forces in general. This dispute 
may become even more aggravated if the Pacific Fleet command, 
fairly soon, does not find a new way or cover for delivering 
nuclear waste to its customers abroad in order to maintain this 
fleet's sailors' additional means of "earning their livelihood." 
<H5>  Fruit in Exchange for Nuclear Materials </H5>
  Apparently the worry about the cut-off of the flow of "used 
nuclear materials and nuclear fuel scrap from Russian 
submarines" to foreign companies is preoccupying not only the 
sailors of the Pacific Fleet, but also -- and perhaps even more 
so -- the buyers. On the evening of 20 October, two days after 
Green Peace had announced that it had spotted an attempt to dump 
nuclear materials into the sea, there arrived in Moscow, coming 
from Dusseldorf (Germany), an Iranian citizen by the name of 
Farhat Sayyidi Farsangadari [name as transliterated], chairman 
of the board of the Iranian trade and investment company called 
the "Faris Group," [as transliterated] the owner of a company 
called "FSF," headquartered in the Dusseldorf suburb of Duren, 
which has the job of supplying "fruit" to Germany and exporting 
"industrial technology and other equipment" to Iran. It is said 
that Farsangadari arrived in Moscow in order to review the data 
of the Moscow branch of the Faris Group. The thing that 
attracted the attention of the Russian Ministry of Security 
concerning Farsangadari's visit was that a quantity of nuclear 
materials had been spotted being smuggled from Russia to Estonia 
in the Russian district of Pskov. The final destination of these 
materials was supposed to be the FSF company in the Dusseldorf 
suburb. The thing that caused people to take an even greater 
interest in this company is the fact that it had financed 
recreational trips for several Russian families in Anatolia, 
Instanbul, Malta, and the Canary Islands. The peculiar thing 
about this matter was that the heads of these families were 
specialists working in the Nuclear Research Institute in the 
town of Dubna (the district of Moscow), the synchrotron 
installation in Protvino, and the nuclear installations in the 
town of Arzamas-16, a town which was not shown on any maps 
printed in the Soviet Union because it was a top secret area. 
These experts also had gone to Iran. As for the "recreational 
trips" for their families, which had been organized by Mr. 
Farsangadari, the families ended up joining the heads of their 
families in Iran. 
  Monitoring the activities of the company that Farsangadari 
owned turned up the fact that one of its employees who had close 
ties to the chief, a man by the name of Shariqi, had visited the 
resort of Bad Ems, in the Rhein valley, in the spring of 1993, 
not as a person seeking rest and recreation, but rather as 
correspondent for Iranian newspapers that are published in the 
nation's provinces and as their delegate to a meeting, in this 
German resort town, of high-ranking specialists charged with the 
task of monitoring the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 
organized by the Moultree [name as transliterated] Institute for 
International Relations (the United States) and the Frankfurt 
Institute for World Issues (Germany). These meetings are held 
twice a year, and those participating in them are 
representatives of the basic nuclear powers and the large 
European nations. This time they were joined by representatives 
from Ukraine and Kazakhstan -- two new nuclear powers. Shariqi, 
who speaks good English and German and also understands Russian, 
did not go out of his way to inform the readers of the 
newspapers that he represented -- and there are not many such 
readers -- concerning the proceedings of the meeting held by 
those tasked to monitor any movement of nuclear materials in 
Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, where no such monitoring has 
yet been imposed or where it does not fulfill all the 
conditions. Mainly what he did was to occupy himself with making 
contacts with nuclear experts from Russia, Ukraine, and 
Kazakhstan. 
  This is why the Russian security apparatus concentrated its 
attention on Farsangadari's visit to Moscow after the "scandal" 
that originated in the Sea of Japan, particularly since he came 
accompanied by Shariqi. It is difficult to say whether or not 
the chairman of the board of the Faris Group was serious in 
monitoring the data of the Moscow branch whose headquarters 
occupies the third floor of an old municipality building near 
the Embassy of the Armenian Republic in downtown Moscow and 
deals in supplying fruit, alcoholic beverages, vegetables, soap, 
and cosmetics to Russia and importing industrial equipment, 
electrical appliances, dishes, spoons, and aluminum forks. Iran 
does not need kitchen utensils, but it does need aluminum. But 
one thing is for sure, and that is that he spent lots of time 
meeting with Russian citizens who came to Moscow from Izhevsk, 
Arzamas-16, and Krasnoyarsk-26, which are the centers of the 
Russian nuclear weapons and space apparatus industries. It was 
obvious that the Faris Group imported not only dishes and 
aluminum from Russia, but also human expertise, particularly 
people who worked, or still work, in the sectors of military 
production. 
<H5>  Rafsanjani's Deal in Kazakhstan </H5>
  On 23 October Farsangadari and Shariqi left Moscow and flew 
to Alma Ata, arriving there at the same time as Iranian 
President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani who came to hold talks 
with the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
Farsangadari's name was not on the list of those accompanying 
the Iranian president. However, he met with him in the Kazakh 
capital and remained in constant contact with a number of the 
president's advisers. It should be mentioned that Farhat Sayyidi 
Farsangadari belongs to an old, established, noble Iranian 
family that was close to the throne and distanced itself from 
the last Iranian shah during the "White Revolution" because of 
violent actions taken against the interests of the family. 
However, the family also remained distant from Khomeyni since it 
considered him to be an extremist. It seems that Iran's present 
government has nothing against this family, otherwise it would 
not be cooperating with it, even though Farsangadari, his wife, 
and his two daughters permanently reside in Germany. After Alma 
Ata, Farsangadari and Shariqi went on a quick trip to 
Semipalatinsk, the location of the underground nuclear testing 
site. Since most of the people working there are in the Russian 
military, it was natural for the Russian Ministry of Security to 
have informers there who told Moscow that the two Iranian guests 
had met with the Kazakh leaders as well as a number of employees 
of mostly Russian and Armenian origin who played a role in 
previous underground nuclear explosions. The participants in 
these meetings kept silent about what happened in them, but 
everyone knew the secret. The discussions dealt with inviting 
specialists to work in Iran, especially since the testing site 
had not been holding any tests or doing any work by means of 
which they could earn their living, and the fact that they had 
no future in either Kazakhstan or Russia. 
  After Farsangadari returned to the Kazakh capital from 
Semipalatinsk, he was received by the Iranian president before 
he had his last meeting with President Nazarbayev. After that 
meeting, some observers revealed the fact that the Iranian 
president had proposed to his Kazakh counterpart that he sell to 
Iran the scrap from the nuclear arsenal that Kazakhstan had 
agreed to destroy in the near future. What was meant by 
"arsenal" in this case was not only the rocket parts and their 
nuclear warheads, but also the testing site equipment in 
Semipalatinsk that was going to be dismantled and which was 
needed by Iran -- a country that is on the verge of testing its 
nuclear bomb and which, they say, has begun to equip a testing 
site in the northeastern part of the country. 
  According to available information, Iraq wants to acquire 
what remains of the Ukrainian nuclear arsenal, and this is why 
Iran has nearly reached agreement with Kazakhstan concerning 
purchasing its nuclear installations as well as the necessary 
equipment and technology to make it possible to conduct 
experiments with nuclear explosions. In any case, there is no 
doubt that the two sides have agreed, in writing, with regard to 
their intent to make deals such as these. Above and beyond that, 
Tehran hopes to get something by means of smuggling materials 
and human expertise. 
  The curious thing is that President Rafsanjani, when passing 
through Baku on his way back from Kazakhstan, issued a verbal 
threat, on behalf of the Muslims of the world, against the 
"Armenian aggressors." But these threats were little more than 
an effort to flatter his Azerbaijani hosts. The large Armenian 
community in Iran occupies an influential position in business 
and trade, in addition to the fact that there are lots of 
Armenian specialists -- most of whom have come to Iran recently, 
especially from Armenia -- who work in Iranian nuclear 
installations. And the scientific research institutes and plants 
that had the job of producing Soviet nuclear weapons, missiles, 
and space equipment were located in all of the Soviet republics, 
including Armenia. Right now Armenian nuclear scientists and 
technicians cannot find any work in the fields that they worked 
in because of the unemployment crisis that has led to a 
paralysis of the entire Armenian industry and because of the 
cut-off of necessary supplies that used to come from plants 
scattered all over the former Soviet Union that they used to 
deal with. For this reason they are looking for work in other 
countries, especially in Iran and Iraq, where they see great 
opportunities to utilize their expertise and knowledge. Thus it 
is doubtful that Tehran would antagonize the Armenian community, 
which supports the Iranian regime economically and financially 
and produces its weapons. This is something that Baku apparently 
also realizes. And Alma Ata feels that the nuclear arsenal it is 
being forced to destroy could bring lots of revenue to 
Kazakhstan if it would do the smart thing with its "rubble." 
Alma Ata could earn an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars 
if it, to some degree, also oversaw this "unlicensed business." 
<H5>  Trip to the Plutonium Burial Sites </H5>
  The activity of the Iranian envoys in Russia indicate that 
Tehran is taking serious practical steps to get what it wants. 
After the talks in Kazakhstan were over, Farsangadari and 
Shariqi returned to Moscow. From there, the former went to 
Dusseldorf, while the latter took a plane to the Russian city of 
Ekaterinburg on 5 November, where he rode by automobile to the 
city of Verkhne Isetsk, a city that was not shown on maps of the 
Soviet Union and to which entry was denied even to Soviet 
citizens, unless they had special permission. It is known now 
that this city is the location of one of the centers of the 
Soviet nuclear industry. Shariqi stayed in this city till 10 
November and met with a number of people from the city as well 
as some guests who came in from Chelyabinsk and Krasnoyarsk. It 
is not difficult to figure out the topic dealt with by the 
Iranian guest at these meetings, especially if we know that, in 
Chelyabinsk-40 and Krasnoyarsk-26 they have buried large 
quantities of used nuclear fuel which came from all of the 
Soviet fleets, Soviet nuclear power plants, and even from 
Finnish nuclear installations. Also, for example, after the 
break-up of the Soviet Union into independent republics, no less 
than three tons of plutonium was sent there from Ukraine. It is 
said that Ukraine apparently wants to regain this plutonium in 
order to sell it, and for this reason refuses to pay the bill 
for burying it. However, the nuclear weapons non-proliferation 
treaty forbids Russia from returning the plutonium to Ukraine 
because it is, officially at least, not a nuclear power. In such 
a case, some of those in charge of burying the nuclear waste 
might embark upon selling these materials without permission, 
the reason being that they would, of course, want to serve both 
the public interest and private interests. 
  Russian circles do not doubt that those working at the 
nuclear test site in Semipalatinsk steered the Iranians toward 
the nuclear scrap burial sites in Chelyabinsk and Krasnoyarsk, 
and that those in charge of these "burial sites" knew in advance 
that a representative from the Iranian military industrial 
complex was coming to verkhne Isetsk, so they went there to meet 
him. Whatever the case might be, the Iranian buyer met the 
Russian sellers in verkhne Isetsk, and then they made a deal. 
Their problem now is to figure out how to ship the materials to 
the Iranian buyer. The route across the Baltic republics is no 
longer a good one because it is now being strictly monitored and 
not even falsified documents will fool them. So the only thing 
left for the suppliers to do is choose between a route through 
the Central Asian republics, which are not separated from Russia 
by border obstacles, and a route through the northern Caucasus 
area and Azerbaijan, bearing in mind that the Caucasus area is 
full of highway bandits led by field commanders who are subject 
to no authority and do not hesitate to steal oil from pipelines 
and "confiscate" trucks loaded with powdered milk and children's 
clothes. But the most important question is: What will the 
Russian security forces do, since they are aware of these 
suspicious deals? 
  The problem is that the security apparatus has to be content 
to merely monitor the buyers and sellers because there are no 
laws that allow them to arrest them. The most that the law 
allows is for them to arrest a moving "convoy," but this is 
something that is hard to do. As for the stealing from the 
"graveyards," that is something which, in practice, cannot be 
proved. A thief can dump a ton of sand into the grave, instead 
of the scrap that contains a high proportion of plutonium, and 
mix the sand with the radioactive materials, and it is 
impossible to tell the difference. As for conducting analytical 
tests of the whole burial site, this is something that is very 
expensive to do and does not serve the purpose. 
  Consequently, if the person who raised all the ruckus 
concerning dumping liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan on 
17 October had the goal of eliminating the supply channels of 
Russian nuclear materials to places abroad via the Pacific 
Fleet, in particular, then most probably he did not get what he 
wanted. As long as there are goods for which there is a demand 
and those who possess the goods wish to sell them, they will 
always find ways to market them illegally. As for the nuclear 
materials and technology, those persons in Russia who possess 
them see no reason not to smuggle them to countries who are 
rushing to grab these commodities, as long as there is no 
obstacle that makes doing business with nuclear materials -- 
either legally or illegally -- something that is not profitable, 
either as far as Russia or the other former Soviet nuclear 
republics are concerned.

<F P=106> [Report compiled in Nicosia and Paris by Riyad 'Alam-al-Din </F>
and Na'il Mukhaybar] 
  [Excerpts] As Tehran Radio was arguing that the "only 
solution for the Middle East issue is to wipe Israel off the 
map," Iranian intelligence personnel were engaged in secret 
negotiations in a European capital with Israeli Mosad officers. 
That was not the first meeting of its kind. Iranian Minister 
of Intelligence and Security 'Ali Fallahian-Khuzestani had 
visited Germany three months before. This investigative report 
by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI looks at what went on in secret contacts 
between Tehran and Tel Aviv and how they touched on Iran's 
nuclear program, Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon, and the 
peace process, as well as charges likely to be brought against 
Iran in court cases in Germany, France, and Switzerland. 
Investigations into the assassination of Iranian opposition 
figures in Europe have, for the first time, turned up clues 
pointing to a direct involvement by top Iranian officials in 
international terror. This carries the potential of Iran facing 
an international siege, and possibly a military strike, plus a 
stifling isolation that has increased following the 
Clinton-al-Asad summit. The ayatollahs have, as a consequence, 
gone on full alert and used their Israeli cards to save the 
regime. Does the new Iranian carrot and stick drive signify a 
true desire for openness or is it just a blackmailing effort? 
  On 7 November, 1993, Iran's Intelligence and Security 
Minister Fallahian arrived in Bonn leading a delegation on a top 
secret visit. Hours after his arrival, he began contacts with 
top German security officers under Brandt Schmidt Paur [name as 
published], Helmut Kohl's security adviser. Concurrently, only 
a few steps away from the conference room, Israeli Government 
officials and Mosad officers were impatiently awaiting the 
outcome of the secret German-Iranian session, before they 
themselves held an even more discreet session with Fallahian and 
his aides. The Iranian intelligence team's visit to Germany was 
designed not only to step up security cooperation between Iran 
and Germany: Already, their cooperation in this area was at an 
advanced stage. German experts had been to Tehran to oversee 
the training of Iranian personnel in the latest intelligence 
techniques. According to the German news magazine DER SPIEGEL, 
the German Intelligence services presented its Iranian 
counterpart with sensitive and sophisticated spying equipment. 
  This time the subject of the secret talks had an Israeli 
connection. Fallahian came to Bonn for negotiations with Israel 
under German auspices with the advance knowledge and blessing of 
Iran's President 'Ali Hashemi-Rafsanjani and the Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The aim was for Iran to help Israel get 
a satisfactory resolution for the issue of seven Israeli 
soldiers who went missing in Lebanon, including Ron Arad. The 
Germans are still puzzled over why Tehran disclosed the presence 
of Fallahian in Germany, despite its request that the news of 
the visit be kept a secret. [passage omitted] 
  Israeli relations with the Iranian "Islamic revolution" have 
never been as hostile as Iran depicts them. Everybody remembers 
the role played by the Israelis in the Irangate affair and their 
contribution to Israeli arms sales to Iran. A report by the 
U.S. judicial authorities has recently revealed important 
information about the role of Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres in 
concluding these deals between 1985 and 1986 to secure the 
release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon. After that, the Israelis 
have maintained close, secret ties with the Iranians, especially 
via David Kimche [former Israeli Foreign Ministry director 
general]. The Jewish community in Iran, especially those people 
who occupy important posts in the bazaar and in the trade firms, 
also contributed to these contacts. 
  Information confirms that Tehran chose to hold secret 
negotiations with the Israelis, just like al-Qadhdhafi sent 
Libyan pilgrims to Jerusalem and opened up to the Jewish lobby 
to persuade the Americans to stop hounding him by using the 
Lockerbie affair. 
  Iran, however, knows how important the missing Israeli 
soldiers are to Israel. It is also aware of the importance of 
the Israeli key in Washington and the West. Thus, it sought to 
come out of these secret negotiations with as much as possible. 
Iran asked for a very high price. It wanted to exchange the 
missing soldiers for Israeli mediation with Germany to resume 
the building of the Bushahr nuclear reactor. The German company 
Seimens had started building the reactor in the days of the 
shah. After some discussions, Israel convinced Germany to 
accept a compromise: The Czech company Skoda Belsin [name as 
published], whose shares are mostly owned by Siemens, will 
provide Iran with sophisticated technology. Israel put pressure 
on Czech authorities to accept this, especially since this 
country, which needs money, will receive millions of dollars 
from this project. The Israelis, indeed, organized a trip to 
Iran by the director of the Skoda Lobomer Sodik [name as 
published] between 23 November and 3 December 1993. He met with 
Rida Amir al- Lahi [name as published], the top official 
supervising the Iranian nuclear program. 
  Observers have recently noticed that Israel has toned down 
its anti-Iran rhetoric and is no longer warning Europe of the 
nuclear danger and of Iranian missiles that can hit Tel Aviv. 
Moreover, General Uri Sagoy [name as published], chief of the 
Israeli Military Intelligence, a few days ago belittled the 
dangers to Israel of the missiles manufactured by Iran. Sagoy 
strongly criticized the assertions of his counterpart in the 
Israeli Air Force, who affirmed that a year from now, Iran will 
have the North Korean Nodong missiles, which can reach Israel. 
No doubt, the chief of the Military Intelligence was fully 
aware of the secret negotiations held a few days prior to his 
statement in an Eastern European capital between officials from 
Israeli intelligence and Iranian intelligence.

<F P=106> [Article by Gad Shimron: "They Are Selling Death"] </F>
  [Text] The large antenna on the roof of the building of the 
Iranian Embassy in Bonn, at Godesberger-Alley 133, moved in the 
wind, from side to side. Someone in the embassy's communications 
department, a six-story building with a facade covered with 
white and blue ceramic tiles, forgot to check the antenna 
supports before the winter. But it seems that this does not 
interfere with the functioning of the embassy. The cables on the 
Bonn-Tehran line are passing well in both directions. Western 
intelligence agencies estimate that many of these communications 
deal with a project for obtaining equipment, materials, and 
plans for the production of weaponry of mass destruction: 
nuclear, biological, and chemical. 
  The German Government knows that this complex, secret 
operation is being conducted from here, in Bonn. The Germans 
also are trying to monitor the process, and to halt the leakage 
of the material in the direction of Tehran. The argument is over 
the degree of success of the spoiling operation. "The situation 
is under control," asserts Bernard Schmidbauer, the coordinator 
of the intelligence activities in the office of Chancellor Kohl. 
"We are striding with open eyes to the next scandal," argue in 
contrast persons in the German agency, the BND. 
  The captain of the German freighter German Senator was ready 
to continue the voyage from the port of Larnaca in Cyprus, when 
he received a strange cable from the company's headquarters in 
Germany: "Reload the three containers that you unloaded at 
Larnaca, and continue to Singapore." According to the bill of 
lading, the containers held 225 barrels, with a total weight of 
45 tons, of the material trimethylphosphit, which serves as the 
basis for manufacturing insecticides. The goods were purchased 
by a Syrian company called SETEMA. Western intelligence agencies 
arrived at the conclusion that this material was not intended 
for eradicating pests, but for a factory for the manufacture of 
gases in Syria, and, perhaps, in Iran -- Damascus' ally. 
Therefore, the captain received the order to reload the 
containers. 
  Intelligence officials in Germany relate the story of the 
225 
barrels that were on board the German Senator as an example of a 
successful intelligence operation against the armament plans of 
dangerous states. This occurred in August 1992. But the number 
of examples of successful operations is too small to afford the 
West in general, and Israel in particular, the confidence that 
these armament plans were indeed halted. 
  Iran learned from the experience of its big enemy, Saddam 
Husayn. In Tehran, they saw how in secret, far from the 
knowledge of the public, the world media, and the various 
intelligence entities, Saddam established an impressive 
infrastructure for the manufacture of atomic, biological, and 
chemical weapons. Only the defeat that he suffered in the Gulf 
War, and the UN inspectors that it brought to the heart of Iraq, 
halted the ambitious plan of the dictator from Baghdad. 
  Despite considerable economic difficulties -- Iran stands on 
the verge of bankruptcy, owes billions of dollars to foreign 
suppliers, and does not even meet the interest payments -- the 
Iranian leadership is devoting wide-ranging efforts and 
resources to its armaments plans. Western intelligence experts 
assert that there are two reasons for the decision of Rafsanjani 
and his comrades to obtain a nonconventional capability: the 
trauma of the Iraqi gas attack on Iran during the Iran-Iraq war, 
and the feeling that Iran is isolated in the world, and that in 
its vicinity there are already states with nuclear capability 
(Pakistan, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Israel). 
  The Iranians have plenty of experience in secret procurement 
operations. For example, the SASAD organization, which was 
established in 1979 by the Khomeyni regime, following the curbs 
that Washington imposed on shipments of military equipment to 
Iran. It should be remembered that all of the equipment of the 
Iranian army at that time had been purchased by the shah in the 
West, and the blockage from the sources of supply was supposed 
to bring the Iranians to their knees. 
  That did not happen. From the headquarters of the 
organization, which, according to Western intelligence sources, 
is located on Pasadaran Street in Tehran, instructions, money, 
and agents went out. Mysterious procurement operations, through 
dummy corporations, bank managers who do not ask too many 
questions, and corrupt customs officials succeeded in filling 
the Iranian warehouses. The ayatollahs owe the fact that Iran 
did not suffer a defeat in the war against Iraq more than a 
little to the performance of the agents and managers of SASAD. 
  The organization's tasks were changed at the end of the war. 
The new goal was weapons of mass destruction -- equipment, 
machinery, installations, and plans related to atomic, 
biological, and chemical weapons. 
  The system of relations between Iran and Germany is twisted 
and complicated, and its roots are planted back in the special 
relations that existed between Germany and the shah. Bonn also 
got along with the extreme Muslim regime in Tehran. After 
Khomeyni's rise to power and the outbreak of the war against 
Iraq, the German Embassy in Tehran was one of the few 
representatives of the Western countries that continued to 
function. And the Iranians remember that gratefully. 
<H5>  `Tehran Must Not Be Isolated' </H5>
  Washington's policy of sanctions against Iran is not 
accepted 
by the Bonn government. "The U.S.A. is pursuing a hypocritical 
policy in everything related to Iran," they say in Bonn, "and 
the proof is that the U.S.A. holds fourth place among the states 
that trade with Iran. Moreover, a large portion of Iranian oil 
is marketed through American firms," German spokesmen stress.

<H3>  `They Are Getting Stronger and We Are Talking' by Ya'aqov 
Erez </H3>
  Very quietly, out of the range of immediate attention, the 
existential threat to Israel is gaining strength and impetus, 
without anything happening in Israel that would push the 
barometer of danger higher. Meanwhile, the fear is not 
perceptible and there are no headaches or distress, as if we 
were outside of the range of the missiles. The news about the 
Iranian procurement appears in the media almost without any 
reactions, and for some reason the feeling is strengthened that 
a new syndrome is coming into being, which is related to the 
existential threat to Israel: everyone is talking about it and 
no one is doing anything to change it. 
  Interest and response focus, naturally, on the diplomatic 
process, on attacks in the territories, and on daily events. The 
instinctive desire is to repress the thinking and attention to 
that terminal factor, which is liable to appear one day and 
affect the very existence of the state. Even mention of the 
threat of the Scuds from Iraq, which developed faster than the 
experts had estimated at first, does not spur handling of the 
threat. We are talking and the Iranians are getting stronger. 
  The terror, according to all the Israeli theories of 
security, was never considered as a threat that was liable to 
undermine the basis of the existence of the state. But the 
terror and the diplomatic process, which was born in order to 
neutralize it, take up most of the energies of thinking and 
doing, while Iran, which is arming itself with efficient weapons 
against Israel, therefore enjoys the cover of the smoke cloud 
that hides its activity and its ability to influence our lives. 
  The words of the chief of the intelligence branch of the air 
force, Brigadier General 'A, which were published in the latest 
issue of the force's organ, barely reached the front pages of 
the Israeli press, and it is not necessary to note that they 
were not followed by any response from the helmsmen of the 
state. The response to the words of the intelligence man were 
very low-key, as if the subject were Japan or the Gulf states, 
and not a real threat to Israel. 
  "In another year, Iran will be capable of launching 
long-range missiles of the Nodong-type of North Korean 
manufacture, which could reach Israeli territory from west Iran. 
The procurement agreement has already been signed, and it may be 
assumed that during the process of absorbing the missile, Iran 
will conduct tests on it," stated the chief of the 
intelligence branch of the air force. 
  The procurement of the missile, which can be equipped either 
with a conventional warhead or with a nuclear warhead, is 
intended first and foremost to threaten Israel. The range of the 
North Korean Nudong is 1,100 km, and in contrast to Iran's 
missile arsenal, the ayatollahs of Tehran can threaten Israel 
significantly only with it. 
  Iran is not restricting its activity to the acquisition of 
missiles from North Korea, which does not shrink meanwhile from 
the American threats regarding everything connected with the 
production of nuclear weapons. All of Washington's efforts to 
hinder the source of the threatening war materiel -- have not 
succeeded, and their actual contribution in the field is 
negligible. 
  It is clear from the statement of the chief of the air force 
intelligence branch that what was thought a few months ago not 
to be a practical threat has now become a perceptible threat. At 
the beginning of the year, experts spoke of the Iranian 
intentions to acquire the Nudong and North Korea's attempts to 
manufacture the long-range missile. Now it is clear that the 
missile exists already, and that the negotiations for its 
purchase have already been completed. In about another year, 
they are liable to test it operationally there. 
  The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has means of deterrence. The 
United States is a faithful ally in everything related to this 
threat. Israel is not alone in the battle, and experts estimate 
that the first threat will be on the Gulf States. But in this 
case, trouble for everyone is not half, or even one-quarter 
consolation, and it is impossible to foresee diplomatic 
developments, especially not in Tehran and in the Middle East. 
  And, meanwhile, European states continue to supply Iran with 
components for producing nuclear weapons. The Swiss Government 
continues to ignore the private firms that are exporting means 
of death to Iran. In Germany, the administration is cooperating 
with the Tehran government. And we are on the order of dogs that 
bark at the passing caravan. [End box] 
  "We believe that Tehran must not be isolated completely," a 
senior German source told MA'ARIV, "look at what is happening to 
a leper and isolated state like North Korea. Open channels of 
communication must be maintained." And that was also the 
position that Germany presented in discussions on the subject of 
the sanctions against Tehran that were held at the economic 
summit conference that convened in Tokyo. 
  In order to maintain the communications channels with Bonn, 
Iran maintains a diplomatic staff of respectable size in 
Germany. "Thirty-four Iranian diplomats serve in Germany, in the 
embassy in Bonn, likewise in the consulates in Berlin, Hamburg, 
Frankfurt, and Munich," a spokeswoman of the German Foreign 
Ministry told me. 
  No one doubts that some of them are employees of the various 
intelligence agencies of Iran, who are engaged in secret 
procurement operations. At least one of them is a permanent 
liaison officer of the Iranian Ministry of Information with his 
German colleagues. This fact was revealed by German 
Undersecretary Bernd Schmidbauer, who is responsible for 
coordinating intelligence activities in the German Government, 
at a special session of the services committee of the Bundestag. 
  And there are more. 'Abbas Tafarshi-Mutal'ag, for example, 
an 
Iranian diplomat who was returned home a year ago, because his 
secret activity was too blatant. Or Mortaza Gul'ami, who, 
according to the German prosecutor general's office, is an 
intelligence agent who is linked to the murder of opponents of 
the regime. 
  In addition to tens of holders of diplomatic status, a large 
Iranian procurement office operates in Dusseldorf, on 
Kaiservertestrasse. Likewise, hundreds of Iranian businessmen 
spin connections and deals all over Germany. 
  The network of Iranian-German relations also includes 
activity that they do not like to talk about in Bonn. "We have 
already been cooperating for two years in the war against drugs 
and terror," crowed Iranian Minister of Information 'Ali 
Fallahian, in Bonn, who visited here secretly two months ago. 
His host, Undersecretary Schmidbauer, at first tried to say that 
Fallahian was invited to Bonn to discuss humanitarian problems: 
the fate of German businessmen who are imprisoned in Iran, and 
also the fate of Ron Arad and the IDF personnel missing in 
Lebanon. But it became clear quickly that the cooperation 
between the intelligence entities does indeed exist, and it 
includes the provision of sophisticated surveillance equipment 
and computers to the Iranians, training, and exchanges of 
information. 
  By the way, while Fallahian was enjoying a tour of the 
German 
SHABAK and Mosad installations, and a guided tour of the 
magnificent cathedral of Cologne, his agents shot the Norwegian 
publisher of Salman Rushdie. The day after Fallahian's return to 
Tehran, his agents knocked on the door of a luxurious villa on 
Pasadaran Street, not far from the SASAD headquarters, and 
arrested the owner, Gerhard Bachman, aged 56, a representative 
of the MAN company in Iran for seven years. Bachman, who was 
accused of bribery and collecting information on Iran, was 
released a few days later following diplomatic efforts. 
  But the primary basis of Iran-German relations is the lively 
trade between the two countries. "In the past year, German-made 
equipment and materials with a total value of 7.96 billion marks 
were sold to Iran," I was told by an official spokesman of the 
German-Iran Chamber of Commerce. Iranian exports to Germany came 
to barely 1.34 billion marks. 
  The spokesman of the Chamber of Commerce was glad to supply 
details of the export items. "1.67 billion marks -- equipment 
for power generating stations and generators; 272 million -- 
pumps and similar equipment; 112 million -- semifinished 
chemical products; 238 million -- precision instruments and 
optical equipment," and on and on. Nearly 8 billion marks ($5 
billion). And with such a volume of trade, it is very easy to 
slip in secretly several barrels of chemical materials for 
manufacturing gases, centrifuges for atomic laboratories, or 
precision lathes for machining missile parts. Following the 
revelations about the share of German companies in shipping 
equipment and materials for Saddam Husayn's plan for weapons of 
mass destruction, the German Government, in 1991, adopted a 
series of laws, the strictest in Europe, concerning exports to 
dangerous countries. Iran, Iraq, Libya, Algeria, and North 
Korea, for example, appear on this list. 
  "Any equipment that is sent to these countries must receive 
approval from the Economics Ministry in Ashborn," the Germans 
stress. "The moment that suspicion arises that dangerous 
equipment is involved, or equipment that could also serve 
military purposes, we do not give approval. When doubt arises 
concerning a lathe, or a systems of pipes, or any other 
equipment, we forbid the manufacturer to transfer the product to 
the destination." 
  Israel, for balance, also appears on the list of dangerous 
states. "The apple harvest in Israel was in danger because some 
official in the ministry in Ashborn decided that 300 kg of 
insecticide could be used for the manufacture of poison gases. 
The subject was material that is manufactured in Israel in large 
quantities. The shipment went to Israel only after a series of 
telephone calls, and the Delicious, the Jonathans, and the rest 
of the apples were saved," an Israeli diplomat relates. 
  These laws and regulations include hundreds of pages, and 
the 
large concerns in Germany have established special sections 
whose task is to ensure that they do not violate the law. "The 
self-supervision and the checks of the transactions with 
"dangerous" states cost Siemens between 35 and 40 million marks 
per year," MA'ARIV was told by Mr. Bassler, one of the managers 
of the export audit branch of the giant corporation. More than 
400,000 employees worldwide work for Siemens, about 240,000 of 
them in Germany. 
  "Every transaction related to Iran undergoes examination by 
us," Bassler says. "In everything related to machinery, it is 
easier to supervise. For example, if equipment is ordered from 
us for a sugar factory, but an installation surrounded by a 
barbed wire fence, guarded by tanks and soldiers, is involved, 
then it is clear that we will not sell. If for an ordinary 
housing project an order creeps in for sophisticated automation 
equipment, there is no doubt that it is not connected with the 
construction of housing. The big problem is with products that 
do not go to specific installations, for then the distinction is 
harder." 
  It may be that because of the self-supervision, the 
officials 
of the Economics Ministry do not generally have anything to say 
to the exporters. "Eighty percent of the requests for exports to 
Iran receive immediate approval," stress Bernard Kubi and Harold 
Muller, scientists of a research institute in Frankfurt, who 
examined the German export policy to Iran. The remaining 20 
percent generally go on their way after a series of 
clarifications that satisfy the officials. 
  "Due to the system of self-filtering, we have almost no 
problems with approvals," confirms Bassler of Siemens. 
  "What is the proportion of transactions that are halted due 
to a government order?" I asked. 
  "One or 2 percent, no more." 
  For example, an Iranian order for a very sophisticated 
automated production line. Truly the latest word in the field. 
Officials of the Economics Ministry reached the conclusion that 
the Iranian client, a civilian plant according to the documents, 
was not capable at all of absorbing such a system, and that it 
was not suited for the declared purpose of the plant's 
operations. The German supplier explained the problem to the 
Iranians, and suggested to them an alternative installation, 
less efficient, with relatively outmoded technology. The 
Iranians shrugged and purchased the substitute. 
<H5>  The Unemployment -- An Incentive for the Iranian Transactions </H5>
  The severe system of laws hinders the business with Iran, 
but 
also provides a convenient and handy alibi for all of the 
companies that trade with it. "The shipments to dangerous 
countries go through an examination in the official channels," 
says Uwe Klassen, the manager of the [?Magnet] factory. The name 
of the factory, which is located in northern Bonn, and that 
manufactures magnets and sophisticated centrifuge equipment, was 
linked about a year ago to a series of shady deals with Iran. It 
was stated in an investigative program on German television that 
Iran had attempted to purchase sophisticated equipment for 
nuclear laboratories from the Thyssen company, but it had 
refused to sell the requested item. The television investigators 
asserted that in the end, the Iranians found what they wanted at 
Magnet. 
  "We never sent to Iran the equipment that was discussed on 
television. We work only according to the law," Klassen 
emphasized to me. 
  But despite the strict laws, the network has enough holes, 
both legal and on the borderline, which allow the Iranians to 
procure in Germany products for the nonconventional weapons and 
armaments industry. 
  Germany is now in the throes of an economic crisis. 
Thousands 
of small- and medium-sized machine-tool firms are fighting for 
their survival. In the month of October, more than 3.5 million 
unemployed persons were registered in Germany. The forecast 
speaks of nearly 4 million. Hundreds of thousands of Volkswagen 
employees have no choice but to shift to a four-day work week. 
In Opel, they have announced a wage cut. A sophisticated firm 
like DASA (Deutsche Aerospace), a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, is 
going to dismiss 16,000 employees. Siemens has announced the 
dismissal of 3,000 employees. "Once 300 persons worked for us, 
now many fewer," Uwe Klassen of the Magnet firm told me. 
  In such conditions, every position is important. That also 
explains why a serious newspaper such as DIE WELT came out with 
a headline about Chancellor Kohl's visit to China that announced 
"contracts worth 2.1 billion marks." The headline in the 
newspaper the following day was: "Contracts for 7 Million Marks." 
  "Doubtless, most of the commerce with Iran is legitimate 
commerce, without any connection to this or that armaments," 
says a Western diplomat in Bonn, "and I do not envy an official 
who must decide that a certain machine for manufacturing pipes 
under high pressure is destined for a pharmaceutical plant and, 
therefore, legitimate for export to Iran, or that we are talking 
about equipment for a laboratory that manufactures poisonous 
gases. And it is even more difficult if the official knows that 
the fate of an entire plant, which is also the main employer in 
some town in Thuringia or Bavaria, depends on his decision." 
  German companies continue to supply Iran with equipment and 
systems that can be converted to the manufacture of chemical, 
biological, and atomic weapons, with the knowledge of German 
intelligence, which for legal reasons is prevented from acting 
against these firms. "We are striding with open eyes towards the 
next political scandal," argue sources in the German 
intelligence institution. They emphasize that despite the 
supervision over the activity of German companies in Iran, and 
over Iranians in Germany, in the area of the development of 
chemical, atomic, and biological weapons, they are prohibited 
for legal reasons from passing this information to the police 
and to the legal authorities. All that is left for the chiefs of 
the German intelligence community is to share this information 
with their colleagues in Western intelligence services. 
  Sources in the German intelligence service assert that as of 
the autumn of 1993, most of the trade with Iran is conducted by 
small companies, as the large concerns fear getting in trouble 
with the legal authorities. Most of these small companies are 
managed by former officers of the East German intelligence 
service, who were unemployed, but have appropriate contacts and 
know-how for secret transactions. 
  "The problem is that what we do not sell to the Iranians, 
due 
to our strict laws, the representatives of Tehran find in nearby 
countries," a senior source in German industry told MA'ARIV. 
"Strict laws against exporting to `dangerous states' exist only 
in Britain and Germany. Until there is a uniform law throughout 
the community, the Iranians will find what they want in 
Switzerland, in France, or in Italy. Perhaps not the same 
quality as the products MADE IN GERMANY, but of a quality that 
satisfies the Iranian requirements." 
  "The truth is that the Germans are the most decent in 
Europe. 
They are at least trying and struggling with the Iranian 
procurement campaign," a senior Western source sums up. "In 
world trade, and especially in a period of economic crisis, 
there is no vacuum. There will always be the supplier who will 
be ready to shut his eyes, to put aside the ethical issue, and 
to sell to whomever can pay. It is impossible to halt with legal 
action the Iranian process of arming with weapons of 
destruction. It is possible only to slow the pace. The only ones 
who understand the seriousness of the situation are the Israelis 
and the American administration. Immediately after them the 
Germans and the British. All the other European states are 
rather indifferent. While in Asia, everything is wide open, a 
real catastrophe." 
  This is affirmed by the fate of the 225 barrels of 
"insecticide" that were on the ship German Senator. This cargo 
covered half the globe, and instead of arriving at the orderer 
from Syria, landed finally in Taiwan. And Taiwan is known as a 
country that does not scrutinize the documentation of exporters. 
The main thing is that the goods will be sold. 
  As of November 1993, no one in the West knows what happened 
to the shipment, and if it did not nevertheless arrive in the 
end in a dangerous country. Iran, for example.

China"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Basel, 7 Feb (ATS) -- The Basel-based chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals group Ciba is extending its plant protection and 
pigment activities to China. According to a statement released 
Monday evening, a contract was signed Monday for the creation of 
the first Chinese subsidiary of Ciba's plant protection 
division. In addition, Ciba's pigments division has concluded a 
joint venture with a Chinese company. Ciba is one of the most 
active foreign investors in China. 
  With a capital base of 18 million francs, the new plant 
protection company, Ciba Agro Ltd., has been established in 
Kunshan [name as received] (province of Kiangsu). It will 
employ some 240 people once its activities, which are planned 
for 1996, begin. Ciba holds 95 percent of the capital of Ciba 
Agro (Kiangsu) Ltd., according to the statement. 
  Ciba's pigments division concluded an agreement on the 
production of organic pigments as part of a joint venture with 
the Chinese company Qingdao Dyestuffs Factory. The plant should 
be commissioned in Qingdao [name as received] (province of 
Shantung) in late 1996. Qingdao Dyestuffs Factory is one of 
China's leading producers of dyes, while Ciba's pigments 
division is the world's largest producer of pigments.

  [Text] Bonn -- Germany wants to continue its cooperation 
with Brazil and Argentina in the field of nuclear energy, 
following Brazil's ratification of a relevant nuclear safeguard 
accord. The "quadripartite agreement" allows the Vienna-based 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEO) to inspect nuclear 
installations of partners to the agreement. The Brazilian 
Senate ratified the agreement last Wednesday [9 February], 
apparently under the Federal Government's pressure. 
  On Friday [11 February], the Foreign Ministry in Bonn said 
that this "will create a stronger non-proliferation basis to 
allow continued cooperation in the field of peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy." The Federal Government hopes that Brazil will 
shortly ratify the Tlatelolco Agreement on creating a 
nuclear-weapons-free zone in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
the Ministry said. The German company Siemens-KWU is building 
the Angra II nuclear power plant near Rio de Janeiro. 
  According to reports in the Brazilian press, the Federal 
Government threatened to stop nuclear cooperation after 1995 
unless Brazil admits IAEO inspectors. At the moment, routine 
inspections can only be carried out on appointment and in 
certain installations. If there is a founded suspicion of 
radioactive material being used for military applications, the 
IAEO may also examine the sensitive area of uranium enrichment. 
Brazil had repeatedly been suspected of being far advanced into 
building an atomic bomb.

<F P=106> [Article signed FSS: "Von Roll's Business in Iraq -- </F>
Investigation Nearly Concluded -- Three-Year Inquiry Into 
Illegal Export of Military Hardware"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 11 Mar (ATS) -- The investigation undertaken 
against Von Roll SA for the suspected illegal export of military 
hardware to Iraq is about to end, said the president of the 
Court of Criminal Appeal of the Federal Tribunal, Karl Spuehler, 
to ATS on Friday. If there had not been a hint of illegal 
intrigue, then we would have noticed it a long time ago, said 
the examining magistrate with regard to a possible indictment. 
  On 18 March 1991, the Federal Council ordered an inquiry 
into 
Von Roll SA in Bern, as well as a Vaud-based company. The 
federal examining magistrate, Monique Saudan, has been following 
the case for three years. The inquiry is concentrating on a 
number of deliveries to Iraq of what were said to be materials 
for building presses. These deliveries were made between 1989 
and 1990. 
<H5>  Iraqi Supergun </H5>
  An inquiry opened in May 1990 by the Swiss public 
prosecutor's office concluded that there was a suspicion of the 
manufacture and illegal delivery of weaponry, which is said to 
have been used in the manufacture of the Iraqi "supergun." 
  Although the inquiry has taken a particularly long time, 
Federal Judge Karl Spuehler said that it is not a question of 
being delayed. The president of the Court of Criminal Appeal, to 
whom Judge Monique Saudan must make a monthly report, explained 
that there were three reasons for the long duration. 
  First of all, the matter is extremely complex. The case has 
international ramifications, and is therefore linked to requests 
for judicial cooperation, which take a lot of time. Moreover, 
certain interim decisions were attacked by defense. 
<H5>  No Specific Date </H5>
  On the basis of the most recent interim reports from Judge 
Saudan, Judge Spuehler predicts that the final report will be 
submitted within the "foreseeable" future. Mrs. Saudan herself 
did not wish to communicate the specific date for the submission 
of her final report. Nor did she want to say if she will 
recommend an indictment. She limited herself to stressing that 
if there had been no hint of guilty intrigues, then this would 
have been noticed a long time ago. 
  Judge Saudan will have to forward her report to Appenzell 
public prosecutor Felix Baenziger in Trogen [Aargau canton). 
Mr. Baenziger was appointed as extraordinary federal public 
prosecutor for this case. He is the one who will decide, if 
necessary, whether a complaint should be filed against the 
management of Von Roll, and on what grounds. 
  Under the presidency of Karl Spuehler, the Court of Criminal 
Appeal of the Federal Tribunal will then decide what action 
should be taken. If it approves the complaint, the file will be 
forwarded to the Penal Chamber of the Federal Tribunal. 
  Von Roll is first waiting for the publication of the 
preliminary inquiry report. The Solothurn-based group still 
feels that it has not "knowingly or willingly" committed any 
crime, said its spokesman Victor Bader.

<F P=106> [Article by Chris Yeung in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Excerpts] Beijing has boosted its defence budget by 20 per 
cent in an apparent bid to expedite modernisation of weaponry. 
  While addressing the National People's Congress (NPC) 
yesterday, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said the State Council 
had earmarked 52.04 billion yuan (HK$46.2 billion) for national 
defence for 1994. The percentage increase this year was the 
highest since 1979, when patriarch Deng Xiaoping launched his 
economic reforms, one of whose tenets was to curtail military 
spending and devote more resources to the economy. 
  China's military outlay takes up 9.59 per cent of its total 
governmental expenditure, as compared with 23 per cent for 
Taiwan, 24.3 per cent for South Korea and 17.6 per cent for the 
United States. A total of 43.25 billion yuan was spent on the 
People's Liberation Army (PLA) last year, slightly more than the 
original target. About 42.5 billion yuan had been set aside for 
national defence in last year's budget, which represented an 
increase of 14.8 per cent over the 1992 figure. [passage omitted] 
  "The PLA is pumping funds and resources into developing 
nuclear-powered submarines as well as medium-range missiles that 
could be launched by them," a military source said. The source 
added that priority was set after the top brass decided late 
last year to scrap the plan for building aircraft carriers. 
  "China's five existing nuclear submarines are old Soviet 
models that are terribly antiquated," the source said. "The PLA 
is testing a submarine-launched missile that has a range of 
around 400 kilometres." 
  Western military analysts said the PLA's Second Artillery 
Unit was aggressively developing medium to long-range ballistic 
missiles, including the Dong Fang 25 and the Dong Fang 31 
models, which had ranges of respectively 1,700 km and 8,000 km. 
  At the same time, emphasis is being put on churning out a 
new 
generation of solid-fuel Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles. 
  The analysts said the PLA had to spend more money developing 
its own weapons systems partly due to the stalemate in efforts 
to procure Russian military technology. They added discussions 
on buying another batch of SU27 jet fighters from Moscow -- as 
well as a co-production agreement to turn out MiG aircraft on 
Chinese soil -- had bogged down because of Russian reluctance to 
part with top-of-the-line know-how. 
  However, with the revival of military co-operation with 
Europe and even the United States, the top brass is again 
hopeful of acquiring sophisticated hardware from the Western 
world. "In view of the recent 30 odd per cent devaluation of 
the yuan, the 52.04 billion yuan budget is not much to play 
around with," a Beijing diplomat said.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The trade ministry is 
studying whether or not to back down from a planned nuclear fuel 
recycling project using plutonium, a senior ministry official 
said Friday [4 March]. 
  He said it does not mean, however, that the ministry will 
surely move toward cutting the project. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has 
yet to reach any conclusion on its plutonium policy as reported 
recently, said the official, who declined to be named. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that the ministry 
has decided to postpone full-scale use of plutonium for nuclear 
recycling until its economic feasibility is confirmed. 
  The economic daily also cited global fear for nuclear 
proliferation in Japan and a diminishing need for an immediate 
establishment of nuclear recycling amid falling uranium prices 
as other reasons behind Japan's review of its plutonium policy. 
  The trade ministry's advisory body will probably issue a 
proposal on the matter in its interim report in June, the 
official said. 
  Meanwhile, the MITI official confirmed a newspaper report 
that the ministry will assist a shift of idle petrochemical 
production facilities in Japan to China. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI said Friday the nation's petrochemical 
companies will transfer unused facilities to China at an 
ethylene equivalent of 1 million tons. 
  The official said MITI will shortly send a mission to China 
to work out details on the scheme.

said the official who wants not to be identified. 
  Japan is known to be ahead of other countries in R &amp; D

  [Text] Fukui, March 4 KYODO -- Somes 100 people staged a 
demonstration Friday [4 March] as the final shipment of 
plutonium fuel arrived at Japan's prototype fast-breeder reactor 
Monju in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. 
  The reactor, operated by the governmental Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corp., will soon reach criticality, the 
stage when a nuclear chain reaction is self-sustaining. 
  It will then produce 280,000 kilowatts of electricity. 
  Four large-scale trucks packed with 21 fuel assemblies set 
out Thursday afternoon from the factory in Tokai, Ibaraki 
Prefecture, where the mixture of plutonium and enriched uranium 
is produced. 
  Although the government tried to keep the transport route 
secret, as with previous plutonium deliveries, antinuclear 
groups tracked its progress along roads across Honshu to the Sea 
of Japan coast. 
  Since the first controversial plutonium shipment to Monju in 
July 1992, a total of 200 fuel assemblies have been delivered, 
including five for experimental purposes. 
  Monju was originally scheduled to reach criticality last 
October but its start-up had to be postponed due to a technical 
mishap in fuel production last July.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Chung-kun from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China has been closely analyzing North Korea's 
nuclear technology level during the past year since the North 
Korean nuclear issue became an international issue. It was 
learned that China ultimately concluded that North Korea had not 
yet reached the level of developing nuclear warheads. 
  A high-ranking diplomatic source in Beijing said: "After a 
long investigation into various aspects of the North Korean 
nuclear issue, China judges that North Korea's current nuclear 
technology is only at the level of reprocessing plutonium and 
that it has yet to reach the level of nuclear enrichment." 
  According to this source, China views that North Korea's 
economy limits nuclear development.

  [Text] Iatch from Seoul, SANKEI SHIMBUN reported today that 
a missile plant exploded in November 1991 in Kanggye city in the 
northern area of Chagang Province, North Korea, in which 
military plants are concentrated. The paper reported that 
approximately 200 workers were killed and a great number of 
homes were destroyed in the explosion. 
  The paper also reported that Mr. Ko Chon-song, 32, who 
defected to the ROK from North Korea in June last year, said 
this in an interview with SANKEI SHIMBUN. 
  Mr. Ko Chon-song said that the explosion took place at the 
Kanggye No. 26 General Plant, the largest underground facility 
in North Korea, which was built after tunneling the mountain. 
  He said that the explosion took place at 2130 on 30 November 
1991 and that the plant had produced missiles and other various 
kinds of weapons, including rocket bombs, bombs, mines, and 
torpedoes. He added that it had produced Hwasong-1 
ground-to-air and air-to-air missiles with a range of 200 km.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] On 3 March, Seoul vernacular newspapers 
react to Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, 
who expressed the hope that the "ROK would abolish the National 
Security Law." 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word 
editorial entitled "United States and the National Security Law." 
  It first says that abolishing the National Security Law is 
not a matter that a third country can intervene in, and adds 
that, unlike what he has said, the law does not exist to hinder 
the promotion of human rights in the ROK, and that he should 
have been cautious in commenting anything on the ROK because he 
is a leading member of the U.S. delegation to the scheduled 
third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. Noting the possibility 
that North Korea persistently raised the issue concerning the 
National Security Law during the recent North Korea-U.S. 
negotiations, the editorial suspects that in a hasty effort to 
make North Korea accept nuclear inspections, the United States 
may have agreed during its negotiations with North Korea that it 
would later say something about the National Security Law. The 
editorial then concludes: "Hubbard made such remarks at a time 
it has been learned there may be some conflict or disharmony 
between the ROK and the United States concerning the North 
Korean nuclear issue. Such remarks may possibly make us an 
`uneasy spectator.' This is the problem." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word 
editorial entitled "True Intention of Hubbard, Who Hoped for the 
Abolition of the National Security Law." The editorial 
questions why he made such remarks at a time when North-South 
dialogue is about to resume. The editorial concludes that before 
expressing the hope that the National Security Law would be 
abolished, the United States should ask North Korea to "stop 
suppressing its people and abolish its criminal laws" which bear 
a resemblance to those of the Stalinist era. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word 
editorial entitled "What a U.S. Official Should and Should Not 
Say." The editorial first says that his remarks are 
"inappropriate" and "undesirable." The editorial even suspects 
that the National Security Law may have been a topic in the 
negotiations between the United States and North Korea. The 
editorial concludes: "An ROK- U.S. cooperation system must be 
further strengthened to prevent a similar confusion in the 
future."

  [Text] In a 10 March statement, United States Ambassador to 
Thailand David Lambertson noted that there had been no new 
developments following the U.S. warning six months ago about 
three Thai companies supplying workers to work under the 
chemical weapons plant project in Rabta, Libya. He said that 
although the Thai Government tried to solve the problem and 
arrested the Thai businessmen for sending workers to Libya 
without official permits, there has been no change in the 
situation. 
  The three companies are: the SPC Suphachok, or SPC 
Supertrade; V and M Engineering; and an affiliated firm of 
Wintrade and Winman. The ambassador said the three will be 
barred from doing business with American companies. 
  Wirot Sakunmuthita, owner of the V and M Engineering 
Company, 
has denied the charges, but admitted designing and overseeing 
the construction of a "safety bunker" in a complex which the 
United States believes is the chemical weapons factory. Wirot 
said his arrest was politically motivated and carried out under 
U.S. pressure. He said he has cancelled all contracts to build 
"safety bunkers" in Libya. 
  Following the arrest in October of Thai businesses sending 
workers to Libya, Libyan Leader Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi threatened 
to expel Thai workers from his country. Although no concrete 
action was taken afterwards, hundreds of Thai workers left Libya 
for home. There are about 20,000 Thai workers left in Libya.

  [Text] The tin box marked "Uranium: Danger" that was seized 
by a Burapha Task Force unit in Aranyaprathet over a week ago is 
believed to be depleted Uranium 238 that was used by the U.S. 
Army in the Vietnam war. 
  A source at the Army's Scientific Department said the 
military always used this depleted uranium for the purpose of 
making armour-piercing-bullets because of its high penetration 
power. 
  He said Thai army officers had occasionally received similar 
items in the form of sticks from its intelligence unit but it 
had never come in a tin box. 
  The source said the department so far had not sent any 
officer to fetch the box to determine the type of substance it 
contains, but he believes it might be Uranium 238, as it was 
widely used by the U.S. Army. 
  If not, it might be parts smuggled from a small research 
nuclear reactor unit in Dalat, Vietnam. 
  A Vietnam war expert said the unit was given to the 
Vietnamese government during the Vietnam war for research 
purposes but the U.S. government took back all its equipment in 
1975. 
  He said that the USSR donated the equipment needed to resume 
the operation of the small research reactor in Dalat in 1976. 
  He dismissed the report that the box might contain uranium 
since he had never seen it when he was in Vietnam during the 
war. He believed that it might be a joke or the work of a gang 
of swindlers. 
  Meanwhile, the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace said 
depleted uranium has low radioactivity and would not be a danger 
to anything and cannot be used to produce nuclear weapons.

  [Excerpt] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
yesterday requested of President Carlos Menem that Argentina and 
Brazil expedite their support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, and also praised the Argentine Government's efforts and 
constant willingness to send peacemaking forces to conflict 
regions. 
  Butrus-Ghali said that Argentina has become a leading 
country 
in Latin America and, despite his request, noted the efforts it 
has been making to ratify the nuclear weapon non-proliferation 
treaty. Menem, in turn, promised to hold talks with Brazil to 
this end. 
  This information was disclosed by Media Communications 
Secretary Raul Burzaco at the conclusion of the meeting held 
between Menem and Butrus-Ghali at Government House. [passage

  [Text] On 25 February, President Itamar Franco promulgated 
the all-encompassing nuclear safeguard agreement signed in 
December 1991 by Brazil, Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine 
Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC), and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA). The decree's single paragraph, 
signed by Franco, reads: "Any modifications to the subsidiary 
agreements and acts that may entail the revision of this 
agreement, as well as any acts that, according to the terms of 
Article No. 49, clause No. 1, of the federal Constitution, may 
entail demands or burdensome commitments on the national economy 
will be subject to the approval of the national Congress." 
  This paragraph was included at the request of Senator Dirceu 
Carneiro (PSDB-SC [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Santa 
Catarina]), who coordinated the agreement. 
  The agreement's main purpose is that the member states 
"accept the application of safeguards for all nuclear materiel 
used in all nuclear activities carried out within their 
respective territory, under their jurisdiction or their control 
at any site, with the sole purpose of assuring that the materiel 
not be used to produce nuclear weapons or other explosive 
nuclear devices." 
  The agreement contains 98 articles and refers to the 
implementation of safeguards, the supply of information to the 
agency, inspectors' privileges and immunity, a common accounting 
and control system for nuclear materiel, subsidiary agreements, 
and the scope of inspections, among other issues. 
  As for the subsidiary agreements, the most polemic subject 
during the agreement's debate by the Senate Foreign Affairs 
Committee, the agreement states: "Considering the accounting 
and control system, the ABACC, the interested member states, and 
the agency will reach detailed subsidiary agreements that will 
allow the agency to efficiently fulfill its duties specified in 
the current agreement."

  [Text] Although the Angra-2 nuclear plant, in Angra dos 
Reis (Rio de Janeiro), is not operating, its simulator is fully 
active and making money. Acquired as an important tool for 
training Brazilian technicians, the simulator reproduces all the 
operations and emergency situations in the control unit of a 
nuclear plant. To finance its upkeep and pay its operators, the 
simulator is being used by foreign plants and enterprises 
interested in training their personnel. During the past few 
years, professionals from various countries have come to Angra-2 
for training courses using the plant's equipment and local 
personnel at a cost of $30,000 per week per person. This year, 
the simulator will make a liquid profit of $1.4 billion by 
training Argentine, Spanish, French, and German technicians. 
Courses are completely booked to January 1995.

<F P=106> [Report by George Vidor] </F>
  [Text] Brazil has dropped its project to enrich uranium 
through the German jet nozzle process. But not all of the 
nearly $500 million invested in Nuclei's unfinished industrial 
facilities in Resende (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro] will be wasted. 
Brazilian Nuclear Industry, the group's holding company, 
intends to use part of the equipment to transform the imported 
enriched uranium into powder and then into pellets. The pellets 
will then be transformed into the fuel elements, which are 
currently made by another company branch. 
  In order to make this adaptation viable it will be necessary 
to invest an additional $15 million in the Nuclei facilities. 
Only South Africa and Brazil have built installations to enrich 
uranium through the jet nozzle process. But the project is 
today considered economically unfeasible, besides having been 
questioned in scientific circles. 
  Jet nozzle technology contemplates the separation of 
uranium's heaviest isotopes (238) from lighter ones (235). In 
this process the uranium ore is made to circulate in a gaseous 
form (hexafluoride) through equipment operating successive 
cascades. The predominant uranium enriching process in the 
world today is called the ultracentrifuge process. In this 
process the machines rotate instead of the gas (uranium remains 
in solid state up to a temperature of 56 degrees centigrade. At 
higher temperatures it becomes uranium hexafluoride gas). 
  A proposal studied earlier was to incorporate Nuclei 
facilities into the Aramar project that is being built by the 
Navy, which developed its own untracentrifuge technology to 
supply fuel to the nuclear submarine now under construction. 
The idea did not prosper because Nuclei was designed to produce 
160,000 enriched uranium units a year (enough to supply the 
Angra-2 and Angra-3 power plants), while the submarine will only 
need 1,000 units.

  [Text] The Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy (IPEN) has 
implemented the largest national project in the field of science 
and technology: the construction of the Oscar Miro Quesada de 
la Guerra-Racso Center for Nuclear Research [Centro Nuclear de 
Investigaciones Oscar Miro Quesada de la Guerra-Racso]. 
  Located 40 km north of Lima in the region known as 
Huarangal, 
the nuclear center is a small science and technology citadel 
where a group of professionals and technicians specialized in 
various subjects are developing a series of activities applying 
nuclear energy. 
  The center's most important part is its investigations 
reactor called RP-10 (10 megawatts of thermal power) with four 
radial tubes [tubos radiales] and one tangential tubo [tubo 
tangencial]. The reactor's core contains MTR [materials-testing 
reactor]-type fuel with uranium enriched by 20 percent in which 
various samples are lowered for the production of radioisotopes, 
studies on the behavior of materials under neutron irradiation, 
neutrography [neutrografia], and diffraction and fission traces. 
  Another important plant component is the radioisotope 
production plant, which entails a series of laboratories located 
next to the reactor that are used for the production, quality 
control, and development of radioisotopes and irradiated 
[marcadas] molecules. 
  In addition to the nuclear center, IPEN has at its main 
headquarters in San Borja a test reactor (RP-0), a 14 MeV 
neutron generator, two gamma irradiators, and several 
laboratories engaged in projects such as the irradiation of 
food, isotopic hydrology [hidrologia isotopica], non-destructive 
tests, and gauging. 
  The Lima, Arequipa, and Trujillo nuclear medicine centers, 
which in addition to rendering routine services also carry out 
training, research, and development programs, are also part of 
IPEN's infrastructure acquired with the support and cooperation 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<F P=106> [Article by Akhtar Majeed, director of the Centre for </F>
Strategic Studies at Aligarh, entitled: "A Nuclear Brahmacharya"] 
  [Text] The joint US-Russian declaration on nuclear issues, 
signed last month in Moscow, is the continuation of the old 
Western policy advocating the indefinite and unconditional 
extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the present 
form. The US and Russia have called upon India and Pakistan to 
join a multilateral forum for arms control. 
  It was obvious at the time of the signing of the NPT that 
the 
spread of nuclear weapons would ultimately facilitate it for the 
sponsors to claim a tremendous success and advocate its 
extension. Flaws were pointed out by India then. It is a proof 
of the abject failure of the conduct of Indian diplomacy that 
while almost all the Indian proposals for nuclear disarmament 
have been subsequently accepted by the world community, the 
latter has now pleaded with India to accept those proposals! 
In South Asia, there is a situation of nuclear asymmetry, with 
an advanced nuclear capable China on one side and acquisition of 
nuclear weapon capability by Pakistan, on the other. This 
asymmetry is not conducive to regional stability. If strategic 
deterrence is to be achieved, in view of the on-going missile 
proliferation around India, then again, acquisition of nuclear 
weapon capability seems the only viable option. There is an 
essential universality of nuclear deterrence logic and it is as 
true for India and Pakistan as it was for the USA and USSR. If 
nuclear deterrence sustained peace in the developed world, even 
during the Cold War, it would sustain peace and stability in 
South Asia after the Cold War. The objective of the nuclear 
policy followed by India and Pakistan is to make certain that 
there is no direct nuclear threat without them being able to 
retaliate. During the Cold War, each had the strategic support 
of a superpower. Now in the absence of earlier assurances there 
is a need that can only be fulfilled by an overt nuclear 
stability in the region. Since wars in South Asia have mostly 
been caused by misconceptions about relative strength, there 
would be greater stability once such misconceptions are removed, 
generating the logic of deterrence peculiar to nuclear weapons. 
  It should be obvious to the Government of India that if it 
did not change its policy of nuclear abstinence, it would face a 
highly inimical asymmetrical predicament vis-a-vis Pakistan. In 
fact, our nuclear disarmament effort is a convenient and 
self-defeating myth. The continued nuclear brahmacharya 
[celibacy] of India is bound to force the rest of South Asia, 
China and the USA to re-evaluate their attitude towards India, 
and that re-evaluation would not be in our favour. If calculated 
meaningful ambiguity is taken for bluff then the force of 
deterrence is lost. The tact that the ambiguity was an 
emasculated one was evident from the lack of any sufficient 
technology effort to use any mythical "bombs in the basement" in 
the event of any nuclear attack by, say, Pakistan. 
  The very talk of `minimum deterrence' highlights our 
confused 
perception of the dimensions of the nuclear war. Security 
involves the capability to absorb the full intensity of a 
nuclear attack and the retaliatory ability to inflict 
unacceptable damage on the enemy. That is true deterrence and it 
is credible only if the enemy understands, not the bland 
assurances that we will be able to "retaliate at short notice 
when the need arises." Once the nuclear status of India and 
Pakistan is understood and acknowledged mutual deterrence would 
make it possible for confidence building measures to evolve on a 
mutually agreed basis. After possessing a minimum deterrent 
capability and survivable delivery system, it would not be 
necessary, at least for India, to enter into a nuclear arms 
race. Since deterrence would be the objective, and not the 
accumulation of a large arsenal, a South Asian nuclear arm race 
would not be needed. The proposal of nuclear free South Asia is 
not in conformity with the prevailing realities, and what we can 
do is to attempt to create a nuclear weapons-safe South Asia. 
Mutual arms reductions and confidence building can be attempted 
once nuclear stability is reached in South Asia. 
  There is a deliberate Western policy to project an 
exaggerated over-nuclearised scenario in South Asia where 
tactical nuclear weapons are integrated even in routine military 
exercises. Therefore, a need to maintain `nuclear restraint' 
while trying to save the situation through regional arms control 
measures [sentence as published]. The Seymor Hersh article, in 
the NEW YORKER, was one such plant about events in 1990 that 
supposedly almost led to a nuclear war between the two 
countries. But this policy has to be viewed in the light of what 
happened with the much-publicised Indo-Russian cryogenic engine 
deal. More than the concerns about non-proliferation, and 
potential uses of the rocket, it was a message to India that it 
would be impossible to operate independently of the USA as far 
as proliferation is concerned; and it would not be possible for 
the Russians to rescue India, like in the past. One flaw in this 
approach is the continuing and wishful habit of treating India 
and Pakistan at par. Any parity, if it has to be calculated at 
all, can only be between India and China. With the prevalence of 
the India-Pakistan one, formulations of the Cold War era are 
again dominating South Asia. 
  Closed-door `clubs' and `regimes' intending to impose 
unilateral sanctions and restrictions on technology in a 
discriminatory manner cannot prevent proliferation. Neither is 
this possible only through the arms-reduction approach. The 
Missile Technology Control Regime has not been as effective a 
deterrent as it is claimed. Pakistan's missile programme has not 
suffered, for example. As China pointed out in October 1993, 
"conditional moratorium designed to maintain nuclear superiority 
while refusing to renounce nuclear deterrence and commit 
ourselves to complete prohibition and thorough destruction of 
nuclear weapons is of no significance." 
  There has been talk that while India may not sign the NPT, 
it 
will unilaterally give an assurance to abide by its provisions. 
Obviously, such proposals have not taken into consideration the 
ineffectiveness of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
verifications as far as clandestine diversions are concerned. We 
know too well about Israel, South Africa, Iraq, Pakistan and 
North Korea. 
  Since the objective of our nuclear policy is no longer 
valid, 
continuation with ambivalence would serve no purpose. Merely 
reiterating that India would hot be the first one to introduce 
nuclear weapons in the region cannot take the place of a 
definite policy option. That is possible if steps are taken to 
trade off costly conventional forces for nuclear capability 
while simultaneously pursuing regional confidence building 
measures. This would not only lower the risk factors but reduce 
the danger of the use of nuclear weapons, by design or accident.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Harish N. Das: "Indian Nuclear Establishments </F>
Get Clean Chit From IAEA"] 
  [Text] The recent statement of Vienna-based International 
Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, that nuclear establishments in India 
are safe is a rebuff to Columbia Broadcasting Service Network. 
In a 60-Minutes report a few days back, CBS had charged that 
India's nuclear plants are safety hazards. The CBS charge seems 
to be a planted story by the vested interests in the U.S. 
Administration to create anti-India opinion in international 
community to put pressure on India to sign the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty]. Dr. R. Chidambaram, chairman of 
Atomic Energy Commission, has described the American TV story as 
malicious, mischievous, and a deliberate attempt to misrepresent 
the facts. 
  Dr. (Maurice Russel), assistant director general for nuclear 
safety of IAEA, on Tuesday rightly said that safety or the lack 
of it cannot be judged merely by televising or publishing a few 
of the good or bad points. According to IAEA, Atomic Energy 
Regulatory Board of India is making substantial progress in 
implementing the required safety standards, which are comparable 
to internationally acceptable norms and levels. According to 
international regulation, the same ultimate safety goods can be 
achieved by different countries in different ways through 
systems or procedures differently adopted to suit the specific 
national conditions. Safety is based on an overall safety 
consciousness and safety culture, which have their roots not 
only in technical capability but also in the sociocultural 
makeup of a country and the openness with which safety-related 
issues are discussed with the media as well as national 
specialists and international counterparts. Dr. (Maurice), who 
visited various Indian nuclear installations last week, was 
greatly impressed by the team spirit of Indian qualified 
personnel in manning the activities of the plants, which 
contribute as essential elements toward building a healthy 
safety culture. Dr. (Maurice) has offered to cooperate with 
India in emergency safety regulations at its nuclear power 
plants. 
  In fact, the Clinton administration has of late shifted from 
its earlier policy and undertones of its policy are biased 
against India. Various officials of U.S. Administration have 
been issuing irresponsible statements on various aspects of 
Indian life, be it trade, human rights, environment, management, 
defense, or India's national integration. Based on half-baked 
truths, they have been issuing statements on India and have been 
trying to pose as if they are the best world preachers. Despite 
the vows of interest in participating in India's economic 
resurgence, America has been misleading the world community 
about India's nuclear policy. By its report on the safety 
conditions in the Indian nuclear installations, CBS was trying 
to frighten the world when it said that India's nuclear 
installations pose safety hazards. 
  The U.S. Administration has also been insisting on pursuing 
the proposal of keeping South Asia a nuclear-free zone in the 
face of India's discernible reluctance. The USA is least 
bothered with the existence of nuclear weapons and ballistic 
missiles in Central Asia. It is also not bothered by the 
continuing transfer of missile- related technology from China to 
Pakistan, including the shipment of Chinese M-11 missile parts 
to Islamabad. The USA deliberately kept its eyes and ears 
closed when nuclear technology was being clandestinely stolen 
from USA by Pakistan. The double standard of the USA on Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty has prevented India from signing the NPT 
so far. On the part of India, it is prudent to ignore pinpricks 
and statements from the U.S. officials and should not materially 
change its nuclear policy of utilizing atomic energy for 
peaceful purposes only, necessary for development requirements 
of the nation. [sentence as heard] The USA must realize that 
preventing others from acquiring nuclear capability will prove 
ineffective as long as it perpetuates retention of its own and 
others' nuclear arsenals. If the U.S. is really interested in 
South Asia to pull back from nuclear threshold, it should 
promote such a dialogue rather than exacerbate tensions by 
encouraging Kashmiri militancy. India's perseverance and 
firmness on the nuclear issue could bring this home.

  [Text] Bombay -- Assistant Director General for Nuclear 
Safety, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Morris Rosen 
who was present at a seminar for exchange of operational safety 
experience of pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWR's) here, 
said at a press conference that he had heard about the CBS 
60-minute TV report on operational hazards in Indian nuclear 
reactors. 
  `I have not seen it. You have to be well aware of what's 
going on. You have to look at the design, operation, people 
involved and maintenance of the reactor'. `In India. there is a 
well knit group with a lot of morale, which has worked together 
for long, has good experience an advantage over other 
countries', he said. 
  `In developing countries, the equipment may not be the 
latest 
but if you can adapt the machine to the given conditions, it is 
good enough. It is very easy to take a camera into people's 
homes and point out the dirt', he added. 
  Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, Dr R Chidambaram 
described the American television news programme as malicious, 
mischievous and a deliberate mis-representation of facts'. 
  The report purports to expose ill-effects of radiation due 
to 
our reactors by focusing on some village ten miles away from the 
power plant. It seems a deliberate campaign to misrepresent our 
nuclear programme " he said. 
  Th operational radiological exposure to workers in our 
reactors is within specified limits, our main objective is to 
reduce the collective dose, he added. 
  The CBS show had criticised the functioning of Indian 
nuclear 
reactors by suggesting that safety guidelines were being 
violated in their working. 
  Pakistan was conspicuous by its absence at this meeting 
which 
was expected to bring together technical experts of the six 
member states which operate PHWR's, namely Argentina, Canada, 
India, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea for an exchange of 
information on safety standards.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 23, IRNA -- Major General Mohsen Rezaie 
in an interview with the English daily TEHRAN TIMES scoffed at 
Western media reports claiming Iran was for nuclear weapons. 
  "Political logic, morality, our own culture, and above all 
the situation in today's world does not allow us to have such 
deadly weapons." 
  The commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) 
in an interview to be pulished Thursday, also said that 
political wisdom demands us not to go for the weapons which 
could cause devastation for humanity. 
  "The eight-year-old Iraqi imposed war is proof of the real 
nature of our combatants who never violated the internationally 
recognized norms concerning wars," he added. 
  "That Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons ...is just a 
baseless rumor," Rezaie said. 
  Commenting on the Persian Gulf he said, the geographical 
situation of the waterway is such that the deep water is on 
Iran's side which enables the Islamic forces to keep alien 
warships under surveillance. 
  Without going into details he said that there was a plot 
hatched by Britain, Israel and the United States to keep 
regional tensions high. 
  "I tell my friends in the UAE to listen to my advice as Iran 
wants to continue friendly relations with all the sheikhdoms," 
he added. 
  On the post-war role of the IRGC, Rezaie said that the IRGC 
was busy with extensive construction projects in the country.

  [Text] Anthony Lake, the assistant to the U.S. president 
for national security affairs, has said that the United States 
must work to isolate rebel states which still persist in 
attempting to possess weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. 
official defined these five states as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba, 
and North Korea. 
  In a commentary on this, the JANA local affairs editor said: 
It seems that these five states, which the U.S. official 
described as rebels, are the independent states which have not 
made their independence subject to the will of the West. What 
should occur is the complete elimination of all weapons of 
destruction from all states. If these weapons are harmful to 
humanity, as is the case, humanity must be saved from them. 
This must be applied to all states, and not by pursuing a 
policy of double standards. 
  It would be more appropriate for those who make such 
statements and calls to get rid of their nuclear weapons and the 
Israeli nuclear arsenal, which they do not only disregard but 
even reinforce by supporting and developing it, because if these 
states which give the appearance of being keen on world peace 
and security did not possess weapons of mass destruction, the 
others would never have thought of possessing these weapons. 
  Libya is a peaceable state which does not possess such 
weapons, nor does it have the capacity to possess them. It has 
never considered doing so. The International Atomic Energy 
Agency has attested to this and commended Libya for it. 
  The continued accusations against Libya by western officials 
are a form of terrorism and blackmail.

  [Text] ISLAMABAD, March 18 (AFP) -- Washington is showing 
signs of rapprochement with Islamabad in talks on the issue of 
nuclear non-proliferation and is reconsidering a ban on military 
sales to Pakistan, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  The talks have raised concern in New Delhi that closer 
relations between Washington and Islamabad could lead to an 
upset of the regional power equation. 
  A Pakistani Foreign Ministry official said here Thursday 
that 
Washington and Islamabad were engaged in "deep dialogue" on the 
subject of nuclear non-proliferation, a priority of U.S. foreign 
policy in the region. 
  Neither Pakistan nor traditional rival India, which exploded 
a nuclear device in 1974, are signatory to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and both suspect the other of developing 
atomic weapons. 
  The ongoing U.S.-Pakistan talks coincide with reports of the 
willingness of the U.S. administration to partially lift a ban 
on military and economic aid to Pakistan which was imposed in 
October 1990 following fears that Islamabad had embarked on a 
nuclear weapons program. 
  The ban was implemented under provisions of the Pressler 
amendment, named after U.S. Senator Larry Pressler, which 
forbids military aid to Pakistan unless the president could 
certify Islamabad did not have nuclear weapons and was not 
trying to develop them. 
  But U.S. officials on Tuesday said Washington may ease the 
ban to enable the delivery of 71 F-16 jet fighters, which were 
ordered from General Dynamics but suspended when the ban took 
effect, in return for a "verifiable" pledge that Pakistan will 
halt its nuclear program. 
  Islamabad has already paid for 38 of the aircraft. 
  Delivery of the aircraft would boost Pakistan's 
deteriorating 
air force, which is equipped with some 100 Mirage jets, about 
100 Chinese-made F6 and F7 aircraft and 34 F-16's. 
  (In New Delhi, India's Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul was 
quoted 
Friday by The Statesman daily as saying that the "balance of 
power" in the region would change if Pakistan acquired the 
aircraft, whose long ranges enable them to carry out deep strike 
attacks. 
  ("Those machines have been manufactured and are lying there. 
I have always maintained that they (the United States) will find 
some way of overcoming the Pressler amendment," the daily quoted 
him as telling reporters at a news conference in Bombay. 
  (The Indian air force chief did not spell out exactly how 
the 
military balance would be upset if Pakistan were to acquire the 
planes. 
  (He however spoke about India's difficulties in upgrading 
its 
Russian-built MiG-21 planes because of Russian reluctance to 
part with technology information following the breakup of the 
Soviet Union. 
  (His remarks followed concern expressed by Foreign Minister 
Dinesh Singh at the U.S. proposal to dispatch the F-16's to 
Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars since 
independence in 1947. 
  "Does the United States want to encourage Pakistan to use 
nuclear weapons against India?" Dinesh Singh said this week. 
  Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, shortly after 
assuming office in October last year, said that former premier 
Nawaz Sharif had "capped" the country's nuclear programme and 
that she had decided to maintain that position. 
  A late Thursday report, quoting sources close to the foreign 
office, reiterated Islamabad's position and assured the 
Pakistani public that "any step taken will safeguard the 
national interest." 
  The report also claimed that the Pressler amendment had 
failed to achieve its objective of preventing arms 
proliferation, but had managed to contribute to Pakistan's 
conventional arms capabilities being "eroded."

  [Text] According to Associated Press, Ukraine has announced 
that it is suspending the dispatch to Russia of nuclear warheads 
from missiles on its territory. 
  The agency cites a Ukrainian Defense Ministry statement 
issued on Friday. Justifying this step, the Ukrainian ministry 
has accused the Russian media of disseminating confidential 
information on the transportation of the warheads from the 
Ukrainian territory into Russia. This is seen by the Ukrainian 
military as a threat to the safety of the nuclear materials due 
to be transported. 
  It was earlier reported that the first nuclear trainload 
arrived in Russia last Sunday.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Belorussia [Belarus] Gives Up </F>
Strategic Nuclear Systems Forever. Now Only Russia Will Have 
Them"] 
  [Text] The full-scale withdrawal from Belorussian territory 
to Russia of the Strategic Rocket Forces grouping temporarily 
stationed in the cities of Mozyr and Lida has begun. 
IZVESTIYA's military correspondent learned this from 
well-informed sources in the Russian Defense Ministry. 
  The Strategic Rocket Forces grouping in the Republic of 
Belorussia comprised two divisions (eight missile regiments) 
armed with the RS-12M "Topol" road-mobile missile system or, as 
it was called in the West, the SS-25. A total of 72 launchers. 
  The first regiment (nine "Topols") stationed in Postavy was 
withdrawn to Russia back in summer 1993. The next four 
regiments (36 launchers) will leave the republic in 1994 in 
accordance with the schedule agreed by the two states' defense 
ministries, and the rest in 1995. By mid-1996 the Mozyr and 
Lida missile divisions will have totally ceased to exist, they 
will be disbanded in accordance with the START Treaty. 
  At the same time the arms and combat hardware withdrawn from 
Belorussian territory will be deployed at Strategic Rocket Force 
bases and arsenals -- they are to replace missiles and launchers 
that have outlived their service life in those regiments on 
combat alert duty on Russian territory that do not come under 
the START-1 and START-2 Treaties. 
  Our newspaper has already reported (No. 25, 9 February) that 
the modernized RS-12M system's standardized solid-fuel 
multiple-warhead missile is to be the basis of Russia's 
Strategic Rocket Forces. Moreover the ratio between fixed-site 
and mobile systems will be 30-40:70-60. 
  Specialists have calculated that these systems and the 
delivery to target of their warhead will cost the country 3-5 
times less than for the sea-based nuclear forces and 5-10 times 
less than for the air force, although they do not cancel out the 
two other components of the nuclear triad. At the same time 
mobile launchers' survivability is 4-5 times greater than that 
of fixed-site launchers. 
  It is very hard to ascertain the location of a wheeled 
vehicle in a vast position area, but silo coordinates are always 
known. To support this idea specialists cite the example of the 
obsolete Iraqi Scud systems, whose launch preparations took many 
hours. During the Gulf War state-of-the-art U.S. reconnaissance 
systems, including space reconnaissance, were unable to detect 
them on the move and in position areas and consequently avert 
missile launches. 
  This factor, as well as many others, promises the Russian 
"Topols" a good future. 
  Incidentally, officers and warrant officers from the missile 
regiments being withdrawn from Belorussia and disbanded, along 
with the enlisted men and NCO's on compulsory military service 
and contract personnel, will not be discharged into the reserve. 
They will make up the strength of other Strategic Rocket Forces 
units experiencing today a considerable shortage of specialist 
missilemen of all kinds. I was assured at the Rocket Forces 
Main Staff that they have all been guaranteed the social rights 
and benefits extended to soldiers of the Russian Federation. 
  Officers and warrant officers from the regiments being 
withdrawn to Russia who do not want to leave Belorussia will be 
discharged into the reserve. They will enjoy all the rights of 
the citizens of the state in which they have remained to live, 
they and their families will keep the apartments in which they 
are now living, and those who have served in the army for 20 
years or more will be paid a military pension in line with 
current legislation. At the Strategic Rocket Forces Main Staff 
I was assured that there has not been a single case of 
infringement of the legitimate rights of the Russian troops 
remaining in Belorussia. 
  Once the strategic offensive arms installations have been 
eliminated on Belorussian territory, the missilemen's military 
camps will be handed over to the republic's defense ministry and 
the vacated apartments to people on the military department's 
waiting list or to other Belorussian citizens. 
  Once it has given up its "Topols" Belorussia will be the 
only 
post-Soviet state to have carried out its commitments to the 
world community without any conditions and stipulations and to 
have really subscribed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons as a nonnuclear country.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 24 TASS -- Ukraine has no 
possibility to fully service nuclear weapons, Colonel-General 
Ivan Bizhan, deputy defense minister of Ukraine, told ITAR-TASS 
today. 
  According to the Ukrainian commander who is participating in 
a two-day meeting of the Council of Defense Ministers of the 
Commonwealth countries in Moscow, "Russia has assumed an 
obligation to carry out a guarantee and author's supervision 
over nuclear weapons on the Ukrainian territory, and all 
conditions are being created here for Russian specialists to 
service nuclear objects." 
  Commenting on the report by a representative of the Russian 
Defense Ministry on the impossibility to service nuclear objects 
on the Ukrainian territory, Ivan Bizhan noted that "there are 
separate structures in Ukraine which do not like the normal 
course of resolving Russo-Ukrainian problems concerning nuclear 
weapons." According to the Ukrainian general, "there was not a 
single case of banning or impeding the servicing of nuclear 
weapons." 
  The Ukrainian deputy defense minister expressed confidence 
that "in the near future Ukraine will resolve with Russia the 
problem of the strategic nuclear aircraft which remained on the 
Ukrainian territory." Bilateral talks are being held on this 
issue, the general pointed out.

  [Text] Washington March 15 TASS -- U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ronald Brown has described an amendment to the 
bilateral agreement on the suspension of anti-dumping inquiry 
into the deliveries of uranium products from Russia to the U.S. 
as a considerable step in trade cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  "The document envisages a joint sale of American and Russian 
uranium products in the U.S., and at market prices, too," 
Russian Deputy Minister of Nuclear Power Nikolay Yegorov, who 
signed the amendment for the Russian Government, told ITAR-TASS. 
  "According to preliminary estimates, Russia's revenue from 
the sale of uranium on the U.S. market may run at 150 million 
U.S. dollars annually. Of great importance is also the consent 
of U.S. uranium producers, who earlier accused our country of a 
desire to sell uranium products at dumping prices, to cooperate 
with Russia," Yegorov said. 
  A press release circulated here by the Russian Embassy in 
the 
U.S. points out that the amendment, agreed upon by the 
governments of the two countries, reflects the mutually 
beneficial and innovatory approach to the solution of trade 
problems and is a new specific example of partners' relations 
being developed by Russia and the U.S.

<F P=106> [Lev Aleynik report under the "Security" rubric: "Lev </F>
Fedorov Unsure Russia Produces No Chemical Weapons. He Urges 
Investigation Into Military-Chemical Complex Activities"] 
  [Text] Dr. Lev Fedorov has stated that he "would not give 
guarantees" that Russia has totally discontinued the production 
of chemical weapons. These conclusions, according to co-author 
Vil Mirzayanov, are also suggested by the recent splash of 
events connected with "Mirzayanov case" and the reticence of 
officials unwilling to provide the public with details of the 
state of affairs in the military-chemical complex (MCC). 
  Lev Fedorov presented yesterday a report, "Chemical Weapons 
in Russia: History, Ecology, Politics." He stated in a press 
conference that "there are no forces in the government... that 
would regard seriously both the danger posed by the MCC, and the 
safety of the population. The government has not even started 
to solve the problems of getting rid of highly toxic dioxins; 
the questions we raised of elimination of liquid rocket fuel in 
the same class of danger as toxic substances also await 
consideration." 
  Lev Fedorov underlined that he and his colleagues "have so 
far received neither from the army nor industry any precise 
information on where and when they worked in Russia with 
chemical weapons. Society remains unaware of the size of the 
threat to our existence." In the opinion of Mr. Fedorov, people 
in Russia, and elsewhere in the world for that matter, "are 
being denied the opportunity to take an integral look at the 
country's military-chemical past and present: reserved for us 
are miserly crumbs of information. Meanwhile the MCC not only 
exists, but it is also totally unprepared to enter together with 
us into the next millennium; it cannot give up the idea that it 
can no longer hide the costly and highly dangerous chemical 
weapons toy, and that it will not be able to get a free ride on 
this any longer." Lev Fedorov stated that "it is necessary to 
campaign for the full declassification of documents once the 
country's leaders sign the convention renouncing chemical 
weapons, to look into our past and get rid of the old onus of 
secrets."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mini Reactor for All"] </F>
  [Text] At the German boat fair in Hamburg, one Russian 
company was unusually restrained. As a subtenant of a joint 
stand, "Roseco" retreated to the last row in hall number 12 and 
was not mentioned in the catalogue at all. For a good reason, 
as it now turns out: "Roseco-Atom Co, Ltd" from St. Petersburg 
wants to sell entire nuclear reactors discreetly. 
  "Our company," Roseco manager Venyamin Skvirskiy says in his 
office in Sestroretskaya 2 in St. Petersburg, "has permission to 
sell reactors and steam generators of submarines, warships, and 
ice-breakers to other countries" -- both plans and entire 
facilities. Russian President Boris Yeltsin himself reportedly 
gave the permission -- the only condition: The use must be 
"peaceful." 
  Russian military officers fear the potential sell-out of 
their most secret drive technologies. Already before 
Skvirskiy's trip to the boat fair, the Russian intelligence 
service told German authorities about alleged nuclear smuggling 
that is controlled by Skvirskiy. 
  When the nuclear manager arrived at Kiel on the Baltic Sea 
ferry "Anna Karenina," customs officers arrested him. They did 
not find any radioactive material -- Skvirksiy was only carrying 
advertising brochures. 
  These brochures, however, were explosive: His offers include 
two reactors for ice-breakers with a capacity of 70 megawatts 
for $100 million. Big numbers do not frighten Skvirskiy: He 
demands $1 billion for 10 reactor units in relay, which yield 
500 megawatts together. 
  Roseco also has steam generators of the new PCVS [expansion 
unknown] type in its program -- for $930 million. Skvirskiy 
does not see any safety problems: He praises the "systems of 
passive safety" of the reactor, which regulates "itself in line 
with temperature." 
  Thomas Schulz-Jagow, nuclear expert of Greenpace in Hamburg, 
knows of already initiated negotiations between Russians and the 
Philippine Government about the delivery of a floating reactor 
unit. The contract has not yet been concluded, because the 
island state lacks foreign currency. 
  Schulz-Jagow says that the facilities' safety standard is 
"disastrous." In the compact reactors, there is hardly any room 
for safety technology. 
<H3>  Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA]: Trade in 
Missiles Soon </H3>
  In an internal paper, the BKA notes a skyrocketing increase 
in illegal nuclear trade in Germany. In 1993, 241 cases became 
known, in 1992 there were only 158. These cases included 118 
"fraudulent offers" -- cashing in without delivery or offers of 
non-radioactive materials (in 1992 there were 59 cases). 
  Weapons-grade material (plutonium and highly enriched 
uranium) was offered but, according to the BKA, "there is no 
information that confirms that the persons making the offer are 
actually in possession of weapons-grade material." 
  For the future, the BKA fears a drastic increase in nuclear 
material, which could get into the wrong hands in the former 
USSR, "if the existing nuclear weapons are disassembled on the 
basis of the disarmament treaties." 
  The summary of the investigators: "The situation is not 
improving regarding crimes in this field."

  [Text] Svobodniy-18 (Amursk region) March 18 TASS -- "The 
state will pay virtually nothing to create the Svobodniy 
cosmodrome in the Russian Far East," Major-General Aleksandr 
Venediktov, chief of the main centre for testing and application 
of space technologies (Svobodniy cosmodrome) said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS on Friday. 
  "There are enough missile silos and infrastructure left by a 
missile division which operated here, to start space 
explorations," he added. Besides, many servicemen and missile 
specialists will remain at the cosmodrome to work, he noted. 
  Venediktov sees his main task in preparing the cosmodrome 
for 
operations and in providing it with adequate equipment. 
  The reduction of the missile division which was on duty in 
Svobodniy-18, started in 1992 under the START II Treaty. The 
last regiment was released from duty here less than a month ago. 
  The cosmodrome needs twice the number of commissioned 
officers now, but the new tasks have to be tackled with the 
present personnel. Venediktov hopes that new specialists will 
come here, including graduates from the Mozhayskiy Military 
Space Engineering Academy.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News" program] </F>
  [Text] It has been disclosed that a retired Russian 
Pacific Fleet nuclear submarine sank near a wharf in a port on 
the outskirts of Vladivostok in mid-February. Although there is 
no nuclear fuel aboard the submarine, it is equipped with 
nuclear reactors. As a result, there are fears about the danger 
of radiation pollution in the surrounding seas. 
  According to information given to NHK by concerned people in 
Moscow and Vladivostok, it is a November-class retired nuclear 
submarine, which was commissioned during the 1960's and belongs 
to the Russian Pacific Fleet. In mid-February the submarine 
sunk in water three meters deep near a wharf, where it was 
anchored, at a ship-repair yard in Tajima Bay [as heard], which 
is located in eastern part of Vladivostok. The site of the 
accident is now covered with thick ice. All that is visible of 
the submarine is its conning tower. The submarine is supported 
all round by ice so there is currently no danger of it tipping 
sideways. 
  There is no nuclear fuel aboard the aging submarine, which 
was waiting to be scrapped. However, it is still equipped with 
two nuclear reactors. As a result, concerned people say there 
is a danger the surrounding seas may become polluted with 
radiation when the ice starts to melt and the submarine tips 
sideways allowing water to enter the reactors. 
  Eight years ago there was an accident, dubbed Chernobyl, in 
Tajima Bay in the Maritime Kray in which a submarine sank and a 
large quantity of radiation leaked. There was reportedly an 
explosion in one of the nuclear submarine's reactors during work 
to replace nuclear fuel rods.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- According to Germany's Federal 
Intelligence Service (BND) the Russian mafia has no access to 
former Soviet nuclear plants or weapons-grade nuclear material. 
BND director Konrad Porzner told (the Thursday edition of) the 
HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that there was no indication 
that countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons had had any 
success in recruiting Russian nuclear weapons experts. 
  "Nuclear smuggling from the former Soviet Union is not as 
widespread as portrayed in the media. As far as we are aware 
there is on the black market no material available for nuclear 
weapons construction, either in terms of type or volume," 
Porzner stressed during the interview. "It can be said with more 
or less certainty that the atomic arsenal is under the control 
of the armed forces there. We have no knowledge that the 
Russian mafia has any influence on nuclear facilities." 
  Nuclear weapons were still sought after by other countries, 
Porzner said, and cited North Korea by way of example. However, 
Iran "is clearly striving for nuclear weapons" as well. Iran 
was already capable of manufacturing chemical weapons, he said. 
The German Government stopped nuclear cooperation with Iran 
years ago. 
  According to security service information, there is still a 
threat to the states from worldwide organized crime. "The threat 
has been recognized but not banished," said Porzner. The 3,000 
or so gangs in the Russian mafia had no access to nuclear 
material, "but there is no doubt that their influence reaches 
into administrative structures and authorities." [passage

  [Text] Several containers of Polonium-210 have been seized 
from the transport network by staffers of the Volga-Vyatka 
Internal Affairs Administration. The newspaper NIZHEGORODSKIYE 
NOVOSTI reports that the unusual contraband had been despatched 
from Arzamas-16 to sovereign Kiev for use in X-ray machines. 
But the investigation will show whether this was actually the 
case. 
  The containers of dangerous radioactive polonium-210 had 
crossed virtually all of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast from south to 
north. And they were coupled to a...passenger train. The cost 
to the passengers of this little journey is as yet unknown.

  [Text] It looks as if the world's nuclear power engineers 
will soon have a safe reactor for power stations. The new 
reactor design has been put forward by Russian scientists. I 
interviewed Academician Nikolay Basov, scientific head of 
research and a Nobel prizewinner. [begin recording] 
  Basov: At present we have nuclear power 
engineering, and work is under way to create thermonuclear power 
engineering. There has been great success in this respect with 
laser thermonuclear fusion, which was proposed by our institute. 
Today we are on the verge of the so-called break-even, that is, 
when the energy of laser light will be equal to the energy of a 
thermonuclear explosion. This is the first stage in the 
development of thermonuclear energy. In order to obtain energy, 
we have to have a positive yield of energy, that is the reactor 
must have an amplification factor greater than one. We estimate 
it at a hundred or several hundred times more than the laser 
energy. When that is the case we succeed in closing the cycle 
and we have a thermonuclear reactor. 
  Why do we need a thermonuclear reactor? Well, oil and gas 
are running out, but thermonuclear power engineering -- lithium, 
from which one can obtain tritium and deuterium, is in effect an 
infinite sea of energy. We believe that there is enough energy 
here to last tens of thousands of years at least. 
  Announcer: The new reactor is called a hybrid 
reactor, since its system unites nuclear and thermonuclear 
subsystems. The times have compelled physicists to use this 
combination in their work. As a result of disarmament and the 
decline in research connected with the nuclear energy program 
large quantities of uranium and plutonium have accumulated, and 
these can be used successfully in the new reactor. In this 
system, a laser will act as a source of high intensity neutrons. 
  Basov: In this case, the energy of the laser is 
approximately 100 times less than the energy needed for a 
thermonuclear reactor. With the help of neutrons obtained from a 
thermonuclear explosion, we can try to ignite normal uranium -- 
not uranium 235 -- natural uranium, or compound uranium. In 
that case we obtain a very beneficial reactor because it can be 
kept in a subcritical state, in which thermonuclear explosions 
of the Chernobyl type are impossible, and that is an extremely 
attractive prospect. The other attractive thing is that in this 
instance there is also a significant burnup of uranium. Whereas 
in normal reactors this is 0.5 percent, here one can expect a 
burnup of up to 5 percent, that is what we expect from the 
initial stations, and perhaps in subsequent ones it will reach 
50 percent. That is, radioactive chemistry will clearly not be 
required. 
  That is the principle of this hybrid reactor. There is a 
great deal of natural compound uranium 238. Today's power 
engineers already have enough to last for a thousand years, or 
it can be obtained. In that sense one is getting a very 
attractive form of power engineering. It is the first step, if 
you like, of thermonuclear power engineering, and that is what 
we are doing. 
  Announcer: What stage is the work at now? 
  Basov: A program has been created. It has been 
approved by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, and it will be examined 
by top official circles in the near future. It has been 
approved by the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences and by the 
institute. It has been approved by the international community. 
I gave a report at Livermore; I also gave a report in Japan and 
in a whole range of other countries, and it looks as if we will 
be cooperating with America, France, Japan, and maybe with other 
countries. We think that in some time we will manage to hold a 
conference of the Geneva type to resolve the issue of how to 
develop this kind of power engineering on an international 
scale. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Rogoshin, information chief of the </F>
Russian Nuclear Inspection Agency, by Olga Sitnikova; place and 
date not given: "How About a Bomb?"] 
  [Text] Sitnikova: According to a report 
prepared by the Russian Nuclear Inspection Agency, there were 
20,000 violations of safety regulations in nuclear facilities 
last year. When will there be a danger of another maximum 
credible accident a la Chernobyl? 
  Rogoshin: The 20,000 incidents included a number 
of serious violations that led to the shutting down of entire 
blocks in nuclear plants, but also included very many minor 
administrative mistakes. Most of the facilities that had to 
suspend operations have resumed working. However, there were a 
few facilities that had to be closed once and for all. For 
example, there were the two reactors at Krasnoyarsk 26, which 
produced plutonium for nuclear weapons. Their operation 
violated all environmental and safety norms: They were cooled 
with water from the Yenisey, which was then released back into 
the river without going through any kind of purification 
process. As a result of this practice, the entire river has 
suffered serious environmental damage. We have also reduced the 
operation of the IR-8 research reactor at the Moscow Institute 
for Energy and Technology to a minimum. The institute lacks 
enough supervisory personnel to guarantee that the reactor 
functions safely. The shortage of specialists is becoming an 
increasingly serious problem. 
  Sitnikova: According to your report, safety 
regulations are disregarded by every fifth employee. Why is 
that so? 
  Rogoshin: The causes are primarily economic. The 
highly qualified specialists who work in "secret nuclear towns" 
earn less than the cleaning women who work for the Moscow 
subway. That is why fewer and fewer young people want to 
complete the complicated and lengthy training. Personnel are 
becoming less and less motivated. Over the past few months, 
their salaries have only been paid out with lengthy delays. To 
put it simply and bluntly, they feel humiliated. However, 
nuclear power stations lack money in every area: There is even 
a shortage of new fuel elements. Some power stations have only 
enough reserves to last a few weeks. Half of Russia's new 
nuclear power stations are operating at half their capacity to 
avoid shutting down because of a lack of fuel elements. Can one 
talk about raising safety standards under these conditions? No, 
that is impossible. 
  Sitnikova: Which nuclear facilities do you 
consider to be particularly dangerous? 
  Rogoshin: Safety at nuclear power stations is not 
the main problem. Following the Chernobyl catastrophe, nuclear 
power stations attracted particular attention from the public 
and government. However, the situation is much worse at other 
facilities: uranium mines, facilities for enriching uranium, 
plants producing nuclear weapons, storage facilities for nuclear 
waste. For a long time, no one bothered about these facilities. 
Many of the facilities come under the authority of the Defense 
Ministry and there were never any state inspections. Today, 
however, these are the very facilities where the most violations 
occur as well as the most dangerous violations. The risk to the 
population and the environment is growing. 
  Sitnikova: However, the Defense Ministry is 
reluctant to allow the authorities to inspect those facilities. 
  Rogoshin: The Defense Ministry is sabotaging the 
decrees issued by the Russian president. In accordance with 
those decrees, our agency is responsible for overseeing nuclear 
facilities throughout the entire country irrespective of the 
ministry that they come under. The situation is completely 
absurd, after all, the president is also the commander in chief 
of the Armed Forces. 
  Sitnikova: Is there any reliable information on 
the military complex at all? 
  Rogoshin: Yes, many of our experts previously 
served in the Armed Forces, and some even held the rank of 
admiral and general. They know very well how serious the 
situation is. In the past, the Navy came some way to meeting 
our requests, and we were permitted to take part in their 
inspections. However, after we had criticized safety standards 
on a few occasions, we were excluded. Today, we receive some 
information through personal channels. Officially, however, we 
are denied entry to military bases. On the basis of what we 
know, the safety risks are particularly high at those facilities 
where nuclear weapons are stored. 
  Sitnikova: There are more and more reports in 
Russia about radioactive substances being stolen. How great is 
the danger that nuclear warheads will also begin to disappear 
shortly? 
  Rogoshin: I think that we Russians are capable of 
everything, and that, unfortunately, also includes the theft of 
nuclear weapons. That is why for a long time now we have been 
calling for a uniform system of state supervision of all 
strategic facilities in the country. Once again, the military 
does not want to go along with that. On the other hand, in the 
civilian field, an agency was recently formed to oversee nuclear 
power stations. I hope that will at least rule out serious 
thefts of highly-enriched uranium and plutonium. As for the 
press reports, those are mainly about the theft of beryllium, 
zirconium, and slightly enriched uranium. Even if one had the 
appropriate technology, it would not be possible to build a 
nuclear weapon using those elements. 
  Sitnikova: Can you rule out the possibility that 
there are enough highly-enriched materials on the Russian black 
market for the production of a bomb? 
  Rogoshin: I cannot rule out anything. Three 
containers of highly-enriched uranium, which was intended for 
use in submarine reactors, have disappeared from the North Sea 
Fleet base. That would suffice for the construction of a bomb. 
We cannot establish what has happened to the containers. 
  Sitnikova: What dangers are posed by the 
recruitment of Russian scientists by nuclear threshold countries? 
  Rogoshin: There are serious dangers. We are not 
only talking about specialists from secret nuclear towns. Every 
highly qualified physicist who has worked in a nuclear facility 
knows how to build a bomb. Everything else is only a question 
of fissionable material and the appropriate technology.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent V. Lavrushenko, including </F>
recorded remarks by A. Zhokin, deputy chief of GosAtomNadzor; 
from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] Lavrushenko: The production of nuclear 
weapons still remains a very well-kept secret -- not only for 
the uninformed population, but also for the federal radiation 
safety control bodies. The All-Russia Conference of 
GosAtomNadzor [State Committee for Supervision of Nuclear and 
Radiation Safety] that was held in Novosibirsk stated this fact 
with alarm. Now the regions that produce nuclear weapons have 
the added problem of storing radioactive materials that have 
been taken out of service. It is proposed to set up one of the 
storage depots in Tomsk-7. 
  Zhokin: It must, naturally, be stored in a 
dismantled state, and it must further be regenerated and 
processed once again in the place where it was produced. There 
are no other places; they do not exist. 
  Lavrushenko: This is regarded as an unconvincing 
argument by the population of areas where bombs have been 
assembled for many years without the population's knowledge, and 
where -- on the basis of this argument -- unexploded bombs will 
now be stored again for many generations, even though the 
military and the Ministry of Atomic Energy are trying to win the 
Tomsk and Siberian residents' agreement by offering large sums 
of money. 
  The explosion in Tomsk-7 last year was a much more 
convincing 
argument.

  [Text] The Russian and Armenian governments signed an 
agreement in Moscow today on the demothballing and industrial 
repair of the Armenian nuclear power plant [ANPP]. 
  According to the signed agreement, the sides will jointly 
inspect the basic equipment of ANPP, [words indistinct], restore 
its operations up to the trial stage, and implement additional 
safety measures. Joint work will also be carried out to bring 
the plant to the start-up level, and to train the technical 
staff. 
  The Russian side is carrying out the engineering-technical 
work to prepare the ANPP for renewed operation and industrial 
use, and is supplying the nuclear fuel. It is also helping set 
up organs that will supervise the operation, organization and 
nuclear radiation safety at the ANPP; structures that would 
supervise the organization of nuclear power production in 
Armenia; and an appropriate system to control and account for 
the nuclear material. It is also drawing up formal and 
technical documents. 
  The Armenian side will adopt the Russian Federation's 
regulations and laws on nuclear plant safety. It will assume 
responsibility for the physical protection of the Armenian 
nuclear plant. 
  The agreement also envisages a number of other points: 
Specifically, the sides will not impose custom duties on 
(?equipment) and goods needed for the demothballing and the 
industrial restoral of the ANPP, and will ensure unimpeded 
travel for the specialists working in the plant and for their 
families. 
  The Armenian side guaranteed that the nuclear material it 
receives and the nuclear and non-nuclear materials derived from 
it or produced from its use, and the apparatus and equipment it 
obtains will not be used for the production of the nuclear arms 
or other nuclear explosive devises, or for any other military 
purposes. 
  The Russian Federation's Atomic Energy Ministry, and Russian 
Supervisory Board for Nuclear Radiation Safety, the Armenian 
Fuel and Energy Ministry, and the Armenian Council of Minister's 
State Directorate for the Supervision of Nuclear Energy will be 
responsible for the implementation of the agreement. 
  The Agreement was signed by Armenian Prime Minister Grant 
Bagratyan and the Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets. 
  Armenian Deputy Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan; Eduard 
Yegoryan, a member of the Armenian Supreme Council Presidium; 
the Armenian permanent representative in Russia Feliks 
Mamikonyan, and other officials were present at the signing 
ceremony. 
  In reply to reporters' questions after the signing ceremony, 
Grant Bagraytan and Oleg Soskovets highly assessed the 
significance of the agreement in strengthening and broadening 
the economic ties between the CIS countries, particularly 
between Armenia and Russia. 
  The Armenian prime minister described the agreement as a 
major step toward solving Armenia's energy problems.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 4. (SNARK) -- Levon Zurabyan, the 
acting press-secretary of the Armenia's president, refuted today 
information of some mass media that Armenia "is going to use the 
Azerbaijani territory occupied by Karabakh for burning 
radioactive waste of the Armenian nuclear power station." He 
called these rumors a propaganda trick. 
  In the interview to the SNARK reporter, Mr. Zurabyan 
expressed an opinion that such rumors are spread out in order to 
prevent renewing of the Armenian nuclear power station's work 
and thereby not to allow Armenia to have an independent energy 
source. 
  Meanwhile, as he pointed out, by spreading out, Azerbaijan 
makes a vain attempt to prove that Armenia infringes on the 
Azerbaijan's territory and even is going to use it for [its] own 
purposes. 
  Mr. Zurabyan said that absurdity of these statements is 
obvious.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Domburs: "The Black Market in Radioactive </F>
Material is Expanding"] 
  [Excerpts] There is no evidence either to prove or disprove 
reports that caesium and rubid purchased by Rimmele and Eichler 
[not further identified] were brought to Latvia before being 
transported to Cloten airport in Switzerland. Nonetheless, 
before this event even occurred, police and special services in 
West Europe had begun to pay attention to the fact that 
following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the trade in 
contraband radioactive material from the East has grown 
considerably. Latvia has no choice -- it is situated directly 
between the global powers of East and West. Is it inevitable 
that it should become a transit corridor for such contraband? 
  "Last year, even INTERPOL became anxious over the trade in 
radioactive metals; principally, Germany. Now reunited with 
East Germany, the Germans are evidently aware, better than 
anyone else, that these materials were available to the special 
services which were linked throughout East Europe. And these 
relations are still vivid...," this is how Juris Jasinkevics, 
head of Latvia's national bureau of the international police 
organization INTERPOL, sums up the situation. Thus far, his 
bureau has not been tasked by his colleagues in other countries 
to investigate possible trade in radioactive metals here in 
Latvia. Over the last half a year, only one concrete case has 
been uncovered. The inquiry, which came from Germany, was 
connected with a car which was stopped at the German-Polish 
border while trying to return after delivering a load of so- 
called colored metals to Germany; border police detected 
radioactive traces in the car. In this case, the only link to 
Latvia was the fact that the car turned out to be the property 
of a Latvian company. In the export of these so-called colored 
metals, Latvia had been the transit country -- the load was 
delivered from Russia through Belarus. The reason for the 
radioactive traces remains unexplained, because German police 
had not been able to find where the load had been delivered. 
  The fact that a special working group on trade in 
radioactive 
metals was established by the Ministry of Home Affairs in 
January, is evidence that the significance of the problem is 
actually growing. INTERPOL has organized two international 
conferences on criminal activity linked with environmental 
pollution and illegal trade in radioactive material. Copies of 
the reports are in the possession of the Latvian bureau and they 
reveal that at the last such meeting held in Lyons in September, 
it was the German representative who expressed extreme anxiety 
over the sharp increase in the number of such crimes in Germany. 
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that in cases 
where the presence of radioactive elements was suspected, 
radioactivity was actually detected in relatively few instances 
(in 1992 -- 18 out of 158 inspections). He stated that material 
often toted as radioactive, is in being sold by taking advantage 
of prospect buyer's credulity. Among every case when 
radioactivity was actually detected, there has not been a single 
case of material being discovered which could be used in the 
production of nuclear weapons, which is the most dreaded 
scenario. In reports delivered at INTERPOL conferences, "Red 
Mercury," as an example, is most often mentioned. As DIENA has 
already reported, citing German press reports, this was the 
material Johann Rimmele supposedly had been planning to buy in 
China. There are different opinions concerning its usage. 
INTERPOL experts are of the opinion that "Red Mercury" is a 
material which can be used as an element in making detonators 
for plutonium-based bombs. The German and Dutch representatives 
at INTERPOL directed attention toward Russia as a source of the 
trade in dangerous materials. The Dutch representative 
emphasized the participation of former Red Army officers -- it 
is understood that they are cheating, by selling relatively 
useless goods as strategic material. [passage omitted] 
  Dzintars Kalnins is the head engineer of the Center for 
Nuclear Research at the Latvian Academy of Science in Salaspils 
-- an institution where Latvia's most highly qualified 
specialists in this field are working. Therefore, the 
explanations and comments of Dz. Kalnins can evidently be 
treated as the opinion of a Latvian expert. 
  First of all, it should be stated precisely that the 
valuable 
materials involved in the famous Lake Constance episode were not 
simply rare metals, but enriched isotopes. They are made by 
growing them in a crystal reticle. Isotopes are applied in 
precise technologies, in radio electronics, computer techniques, 
etc., where the respective isotopes -- perfect, precise atom 
crystals -- are necessary. In Latvia, such isotopes are not 
being manufactured, due to lack of necessary equipment. As Mr. 
Kalnins told us, the institutes which possess the special 
equipment needed to enrich these elements are situated near 
Moscow. "These institutes are practically under military 
management -- so it was during the time of the Soviet Union, and 
so it is now, that in the field of exact sciences, at least in 
this branch, the military line is being developed in the first 
order" -- he said. [passage omitted] 
  To the question of what amount of rare metal contraband 
there 
is in Latvia and if there are inspection facilities to detect 
radioactive material at the border, the answer of the expert was 
skeptical -- he allows for the fact that customs officers, for 
the sake of financial benefit or due to a lack of knowledge, 
often "turn a blind eye." Also, they do not have adequate 
equipment to detect radioactive shipments. Naturally, at the 
airport any isotope -- radioactive or otherwise -- would be 
discovered by a common detector, since it is a metal... 
Nevertheless, the situation in radioactive control is hopeful 
-- at the Center for Nuclear Research there is a laboratory 
being established, where the certification and attestation of 
radioactivity detecting devices will be possible. There are also 
plans to organize training for customs officers and border 
guards in this laboratory. Judging by what Dz. Kalnins said, 
customs officers and border guards are not the only ones having 
problems: Recently, some kind of "mafiosi" called me and, not 
revealing their names, offered me a great amount of money to 
check the radioactivity of some metal in their possession. I 
replied that I do not make deals with anonymous people... 
  A rhetorical question could be put as to whether it would 
not be in Russia's interests if there were strict controls over 
the export of isotopes? 
  "Of course, and I am sure they would do it gladly, but I 
suppose that the Mafia has grabbed it in her hands" -- answered 
Dzintars Kalnins.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Domburs: "Does Voldemars Selga Surpass </F>
Those Who Vanished in Lake Constance?"] 
  [Excerpts] Western security services are linking the trade 
in radioactive and nuclear materials with threats to 
international security. However, big money apparently can also 
be earned by dealing with nonradioactive isotopes, prices for 
which on the black market often are no lower and sometimes even 
higher than those for radioactive ones. The deal that Rimmele 
and Eichler [not further identified] concluded in Riga was 
valued at $2 million. Nevertheless, even this seems to be 
nothing in comparison with the sums with which Voldemars Selga, 
a well-known business man in Latvia, is operating in deals 
concerning rare metals. 
  The document, which can be seen in the picture [published in 
English and Latvian next to the article and reported below], 
dated 3 February of this year, is called, literally translated, 
"Usage of bank guarantees of the Reconstruction and Development 
Bank [RDB] of Latvia for buying osmium." The text refers to an 
already received [two last words underlined] guarantee from RDB 
for $4,555,000,000 (! - J.D.) for the Finnish company 
"Wimco-Erica Finland Ltd" to purchase osm-187, and contains a 
requirement to confirm the right to use this guarantee to buy 
32.9 kg of osm-187 in Russia. The RDB board president and owner 
of the control package is Voldemars Selga. 
  There are also materials in which the Finnish side confirms 
that the purchasing of osm has already begun. Actually, it must 
have started before one of the signatories, visible in the 
picture, began to talk about seeking -- even with the assistance 
of INTERPOL -- V. Selga's partner, RDB Vice President Andrejs 
Zagars, on suspicion of fraud... 
  The fax visible in the picture did not reach its intended 
recipient, and this explains why V. Selga's signature is not on 
the document. The sources of the above mentioned information 
are not sufficient to provide a precise description of the deal. 
Nevertheless, there can be no doubt about such guarantees by the 
bank. According to the initial capital and capital stock, 
amounting to several hundred thousand lats, RDB only ranks 
somewhere in the top 40 or 50 commercial banks in Latvia, and it 
should not have the right to give a guarantee for a million 
dollars, let alone any figure in the billions. 
  Suspicion also arouse over the fact that the mentioned 
quantity of osm -- 33 kg -- is too big. Experts in Germany, 
commenting on the plans of Rimmele and Eichler to buy only 6 kg 
of osm-187 in China, acknowledged that demand for this material 
is measured in milligrams... 
  We do not have any more detailed information about the 
Finnish role. This cannot be said about possibilities to 
describe the personality of V. Selga. In 1984, during the era 
of the Soviet Union, he was sentenced to prison for fraud and 
falsification. Is Selga a crook? This was the question that 
arose in September 1992, when he was arrested on suspicion of 
cheating in a deal with the confectionery firm "Uzvara." V. 
Selga's background in the highest political circles could be 
observed when he was released from jail thanks to Latvian 
Supreme Council Deputies V. Kalnberzs and V. Steins, who posted 
bail for him. After all, he did not deliver the promised sugar 
for "Uzvara," but the money he had accepted in advance -- 50 
million Latvian rubles -- he only returned a few months later. 
[passage omitted] 
  These operations with the participation of Voldemars Selga, 
together with the Lake Constance story, provide food for thought 
-- what is the nature of the environment in which the trade in 
isotopes in Latvia is occurring? Shady. The house of Victor 
Balulis on Sarma Street, where Eichler was kept after his 
capture, is undoubtedly connected to criminal circles. After 
his return from prison -- in the second half of the 1980's, when 
the cooperative movement began -- V. Selga was connected with 
these circles. Viktors Abakumovs and Aleksandrs Kisels, 
well-known people in the criminal world, were employees of his 
in the "Merkurijs" joint stock company. The first was murdered 
in the fall of 1991, the second was arrested for the second time 
last autumn and confronted with charges of blackmail. Today, it 
would be out-of-fashion to call them bandits, as they are all 
businessmen, doing legal business. However, it can be done in 
various ways -- deals can be fair or shabby, and taxes can be 
paid or ignored... 
  In the West, the deals with rare metals are being watched by 
special services and by police, looking for evidence of cheating 
or blackmail, as well as by financial experts, who look for 
possible instances of "money laundering." In Latvia, minimal 
attention is paid to these problems and there are practically no 
chances for controls of any type. How can grams of anything be 
detected, if there are tons of sugar and flour being smuggled 
over the Latvian border? Still, a few grams of isotopes are far 
more valuable than several tons of sugar... Who has ever heard 
of any Latvian special services stating that they are in 
possession of some information in this respect, for instance 
regarding the production and trade control of isotopes in 
Russia? The story of Rimmele and Eichler provided sufficient 
grounds to begin speaking about it, but it seems that while 
quarreling with each other, there is no time left for such 
things. Can we speak about narrowing down the possibilities to 
"launder" money? Probably not, especially since, to date, any 
attempts by tax inspectors to control cash transactions have 
remained in the realm of dreams. 
  The dangerous thing is that trade in nonradioactive 
materials 
can not be discerned from trade in radioactive materials, which 
are hazardous for human health and life, because both come from 
the same delivery sources. In a secret report by the German 
Federal Intelligence Service on the black market of radioactive 
materials and the threat of radioactive terrorism from the East, 
Kaunas and Vilnius had been mentioned as centers of illegal 
trade. Anyhow, this may be little consolation for Latvia. 
Trading will continue in places where there are few hindrances 
to businessmen. 
  [Published in a box accompanying the article is a copy of a 
letter in English dated 3 February from the Finnish firm 
Wimco-Erica Finland to RDB President Voldemars Selga, reading: 
  "Dear Mr. Selga, 
  "Reconstruction and Development Bank of has issued A Bank 
Guarantee No. 4008/KN/AZ/is, with a value of USD 4,555,000,000

of Wimco-Erica Finland for buying Osmium-187. 
  "We have an offer to buy 32.9 kilograms of Osmium-187 in a 
favourable price for USD 64,450 per one gram. The value of the

Horst Hamm, Wimco-Erica Finland will pay royalty USD 300 for 
each gram sold. Your bank shall get royalty USD 9.87 millions

"managing director" of Gencar Ltd.; there is place for RDB 
President Voldemars Selga to sign, but his signature does not 
appear.]

"Nuclear Weapons for Ukraine Are Like a Suitcase for a Drowning 
Man -- Both Too Heavy to Hold, and a Pity to Let Go"] 
  [Text] That which we have long been waiting for has come. 
The Supreme Soviet of Ukraine has finally decided to define its 
attitude toward the trilateral declaration of the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States and Russia. As official sources have 
indicated more than once, this document proclaims the removal of 
nuclear weapons from Ukraine and defines the mechanism for 
compensation and security guarantees for our nation. 
  All of the nuclear warheads, according to the trilateral 
declaration, will be removed from the territory of Ukraine to 
Russia for their subsequent dismantling in the shortest possible 
time. Russia will provide compensation in the form of deliveries 
of fuel rods for the requirements of Ukrainian nuclear power 
engineering. 
  Ukraine will provide for the destruction of all nuclear 
weapons, including strategic offensive weapons, deployed on its 
territory within seven years, and all of the SS-24 missiles will 
be deactivated within ten months through the removal of their 
nuclear charges. 
  Russia will in turn guarantee the technical servicing and 
safe operation of the nuclear warheads. The United States will 
provide technical and financial assistance for the reliable and 
safe dismantling of the nuclear weapons. 
  Everything that is contained in the trilateral declaration 
and the addendum to the declaration, from the point of view of 
President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, conforms to the 
requirements posed by the Supreme Soviet regarding ratification 
of the START-1 treaty and satisfies the restrictions advanced by 
the people's deputies. There were 13 such restrictions, and they 
talked chiefly about the aforementioned security guarantees and 
the granting of financial and technical assistance directed 
toward the elimination of the nuclear arsenal. 
  Life has confirmed once again, however, that there are as 
many ideas as there are people. And when we are talking about 
politicians, then they could have even more. 
  There were meetings the day before the recent session of the 
Supreme Soviet by the commissions on questions of defense and 
national security, questions of legislation and legality, 
foreign affairs and the working deputies' commission to study 
the START-1 treaty. The aim of the session was to prepare 
findings regarding the conformity of the trilateral declaration 
signed on January 14 in Moscow. Since there was not a quorum at 
the session, they did not come to any unified findings, but each 
commission came to its own findings separately. Since it would 
be out of place to cite those findings, we will address the 
results of the working commission to study the START-1 treaty. 
  According to the statement by President of Ukraine Leonid 
Kravchuk, the members of that commission indicate, he has 
confirmed his "commitment to the fact that Ukraine join the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NNPT] as a state not 
possessing nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time." The 
Supreme Soviet, at the same time, had earlier considered Ukraine 
to be the possessor of nuclear weapons, and only the realization 
of START-1 "would open up the way for the resolution by the 
Supreme Soviet of Ukraine of the question of joining the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty." 
  Another detail is connected with the fact that the 
trilateral 
declaration indicates that "Ukraine will provide for the 
destruction of all nuclear weapons, including strategic 
offensive weapons, deployed on its territory," even though the 
Supreme Soviet has stipulated the destruction of only 36 percent 
of the missile delivery systems and 42 percent of the nuclear 
warheads. Moreover, this presidential wording obligates Ukraine 
to destroy not only all nuclear weapons within seven years, but 
also all strategic offensive weapons along with their 
infrastructure. After all, as was indicated on this score in a 
memorandum of the U.S. embassy, "any preservation of deployed 
SS-24 ICBMs after the seven-year period of cutbacks under the 
START treaty would be in contradiction to the obligations of 
Ukraine, whether those missiles are fitted with nuclear or 
conventional warheads," and the United States "will not agree to 
any weakening of this obligation." This categorical American 
attitude signifies that the prospects for the creation of 
high-precision weaponry with conventional warheads based on the 
SS-24 delivery system as a means of strategic deterrence are 
quite uncertain. 
  The terms of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, 
financing for inspection activities, the possibility of using 
launch silos for peaceful purposes, the use of weapons-grade 
plutonium, and expenditures for the social support of officers 
and warrant officers of the missile forces who will be 
discharged from the army owing to the cutbacks all remain 
uncertain in the trilateral declaration. 
  I am citing all of these contradictions in great detail in 
order to give a better sense of the tension that was present in 
the hall of the Supreme Soviet during the discussion of the 
trilateral declaration, the ratification of the START-1 treaty 
and the joining of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 
speeches by President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, Minister of 
Defense of Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy 
Radetskyy and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko 
stressed once again the fact that nuclear weapons are no 
guarantee of security for us, we are not able to maintain them, 
and to go against the world opinion, even if you are correct, is 
a hopeless matter. Nuclear weapons for Ukraine, in the current 
economic difficulties, are almost a suitcase for a drowning man 
-- too heavy to hold on to, but a shame to let go of. 
  The fate of the nuclear weapons stationed on the territory 
of 
Ukraine was resolved in two hours of discussion by the two 
paragraphs of a Decree of the Supreme Soviet, namely: 
  1. Bearing in mind the specific steps taken by the President 
and Government of Ukraine with regard to the fulfillment of the 
provisions of the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of 18 November 
1993 and the reciprocal steps on the part of the United States 
and Russia, to remove the restrictions with regard to Article 5 
of the Protocol to the START Treaty that was signed in Lisbon on 
23 May 1993. 
  2. To authorize the Government of Ukraine to exchange 
letters 
on the ratification of the START-1 treaty and to make more 
active the actions of the Government to reach a concrete 
agreement that flows out of the restrictions of the Supreme 
Soviet regarding the ratification of the START-1 Treaty. 
  What do the two paragraphs of this short decree mean? 
  First, that very difficult and painstaking work lies ahead. 
At least five treaties or agreements will have to be reached, 
which translate or at least should translate the declarative 
substance of many provisions of the trilateral declaration into 
the area of concrete, detailed and documented mutual 
obligations. This pertains first and foremost to a schedule for 
the dispatch of the first lot of nuclear warheads to Russia, an 
agreement pertaining to the procedure and conditions for 
monitoring their dismantling and salvaging on the part of 
Ukraine, an agreement on compensation for the value of the 
nuclear weapons transferred to Russia, and an agreement on 
guarantor's and originator's oversight of the status of the 
warheads that are still in Ukraine, including their transport to 
"S" facilities and plant yards. 
  Second, that it is still too soon to put a period to the 
resolution of the problem of the nuclear weapons stationed in 
Ukraine, since a thing or two remains that is not entirely clear 
or resolved. Although the removal of the restrictions pertaining 
to Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol also envisages Ukraine's 
joining in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after all, the 
deputies were still disinclined to the possibility during the 
voting. Ukraine, under legal canons, does not have the slightest 
right to demand compensation for strategic and tactical nuclear 
weapons in joining the NNPT. The United States and Russia, 
however, as indicated in the trilateral declaration, will 
provide Kiev with security guarantees only in the event Ukraine 
joins the NNPT. So the circle closes. And only time will tell 
what the way out of this legal-political stalemate will be...

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Knysh: "`Not a Sensation...'"] </F>
  [Text] IZVESTIYA of February 22 of this year published an 
article by the newspaper's military correspondent, Viktor 
Lytovkin, under the title "RVSN [Strategic Missile Forces] 
Command Disavows Responsibility for the Security of 
Nuclear-Missile Armaments in Ukraine." Referring to confidential 
sources in the Ministry of Defense of Russia, the author cites 
the content of an official letter of the commander-in-chief of 
the strategic missile forces, Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev, to 
Minister of Defense of Russia General of the Army Pavel Grachev. 
  The article, with reference to this letter, discussed the 
fact that "under the prevailing circumstances Russia can in no 
way have any impact on the security of the nuclear-missile 
weaponry in Ukraine and its non-sanctioned employment." This is 
connected with the decision of the commander of the 43rd Missile 
Army, Colonel-General Volodymyr Mykhtyuk, the commander of the 
46th Missile Division, Major-General N. Filatov, and their 
subordinates to take the oath of loyalty to the people of 
Ukraine. It also talked about the "gross violation of the 
Agreement on the Status of Strategic Forces" signed by the heads 
of the CIS and the like. 
  The facts set forth in the article were commented on at a 
briefing at the MZS [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] by Deputy 
Minister of Defense Ivan Bizhan and Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Borys Tarasyuk. 
  It was pointed out in particular that the Minister of 
Defense 
of Ukraine does not need to coordinate his actions with the head 
of the Russian military agency. Assertions that the command of 
the RVSN of Russia have been deprived of the possibility of 
exercising operational command and control over the troops of 
the 43rd Missile Army were categorized as a fabrication. The 
operational control remains with Russia, and Ukraine has in no 
way disrupted it and does not intend to do so, emphasized 
Colonel-General Ivan Bizhan. 
  The presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the United States 
signed a Declaration in Moscow on January 14. The appearance of 
this article has thus elicited, at the very least, surprise. 
  The fact was stated in particular that no one forced the 
commander of the 43rd Missile Army, Colonel-General V. Mykhtyuk, 
and the commander of the 46th Missile Division, Major-General N. 
Filatov, to take the oath of loyalty to the people of Ukraine. 
The generals, as well as the other officers, did this entirely 
voluntarily. Assertions of some gross violation of the agreement 
on the status of the strategic forces were categorized as 
untrue, because CIS strategic forces do not exist. As 
Colonel-General I. Bizhan reported, Russia unilaterally 
subordinated all of the units of the Strategic Missile Forces to 
itself in the summer of 1992. It is thus impossible to violate 
an agreement on something that does not exist. 
  The manpower levels of the units of the 43rd Army are at 85 
percent for officers and almost 100 percent for conscript 
servicemen. The high-quality officer corps thus permits the 
complete fulfillment of the tasks of combat duty and the 
maintenance of nuclear security. 
  The press service of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine 
made a statement with regard to this feature that emphasized, in 
particular, the steadfast upholding by our country of all 
international agreements signed by it.

  [Text] Here is some information we have received from 
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. It is a statement with the 
following content: 
  Recently Russia's mass media, in particular Interfax and the 
SEGODNYA newspaper have been circulating information about the 
dispatch from Ukraine's territory of special trains carrying 
nuclear warheads which are to be handed over to the Russian side 
in accordance with Ukraine's international obligations. At the 
same time, with reference to informed sources in the Russian 
Federation's Ministry of Defense, data of a strictly 
confidential nature is being broadcast. 
  The ease with which some journalists, referring to the 
Russian military, disseminate information throughout the world 
on the times, dates, and destinations of the trains carrying 
nuclear warheads evokes surprise, especially as Russian 
specialists cannot but acknowledge the fact that such actions 
create a real threat to the safety of the transportation of 
nuclear warheads. 
  Ukraine's Ministry of Defense Press Service states that such 
actions are provocative and inadmissible because they are 
directed at creating a new spiral of tension around Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament. Because of the lack of discipline among 
Russian information sources, Ukraine is now forced to make 
additional adjustments to the schedule and routes for the 
transportation of nuclear warheads.

<F P=106> [Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux report: "Deputies Feel White </F>
Paper Is Acceptable"] 
  [Text] With neither enthusiasm, nor aversion: The White 
Paper on defense published last week will not cause a dispute -- 
at least not in the National Assembly. The deputies on the 
defense and finance committees who started examining it did not 
find anything -- regardless of their political leanings -- that 
would lead to great or violent passions. 
  They read the government's guidelines for ensuring our 
country's security between now to 2015 with "real interest," 
combined with "caution" and scattered "skepticism." They felt 
that the work of the committee chaired by Marceau Long was 
"suitable, honest, and satisfactory," and that the result was 
"acceptable." That is what the respective committee chairmen, 
Jacques and Jacques Boyon, said yesterday to Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard. 
  The pride of France since the early 1980's, the consensus on 
defense still endures. While there are some exceptions, the 
vast majority of the National Assembly does not intend to call 
into question these two pillars of nuclear deterrence and a 
"mixed" Armed Forces model which is based on the principle of 
conscription. The National Assembly also seems resolved to 
maintain a "significant" budgetary effort, i.e., enough to 
guarantee our decisionmaking autonomy. 
  Although the consensus is comprehensive, it nevertheless 
gives the impression of cracking, or even splitting apart, since 
there are now a great many ambiguities and reservations on which 
it rests. The primary quality of the White Paper stressed 
Jacques Boyon (of the RPR (Rally for the Republic), Ain) quite 
clearly is that it does not compromise the future. "It does not 
close any doors," the implication being that it will not act as 
a constraint on the future president of the republic, who will 
be elected in 1995. 
<H5>  Debate On M5 </H5>
  The cleverness of the exercise appears with regard to the 
nuclear issue. The White Paper satisfies supporters and 
opponents of resuming testing. "The moratorium does not 
currently penalize our discussion, but they will have to be 
resumed," echoed Francois Leotard. Similarly, it does not 
bother enthusiasts of any given weapons system. However, on 
this topic, there are many nuances within the parliamentary 
majority. A good illustration of this is the debate surrounding 
the production of the M5, a missile intended to arm 
missile-launching submarines around 2010 and which, in 1992, was 
the subject of a decision regarding missile launches made by 
Francois Mitterrand. Today, Jacques Chirac feels it is an 
"urgent matter," while Jacques Boyon and Rene Galy-Dejean 
[members of the National Assembly], for example, feel that a 
postponement would not be disastrous. 
  The defense minister does not go along with the idea of 
accelerating this program which, he reiterated, could not have 
been launched until 1995. He also confided that he does not 
intend to give the M5 the same warhead as the M45, or to make an 
S5 version for the Albion platform -- "the cost of that would be 
unreasonable" -- unlike what Francois Mitterrand let it be 
understood. 
  As for the future military planning law, the deputies and 
the 
defense minister agreed to meet again, when the government has 
undertaken the necessary and difficult arbitration between the 
Defense Ministry and the Budget Ministry. Francois Leotard said 
he was satisfied that the basis chosen by the prime minister 
should be the 100.4 billion francs in equipment credits to be 
made available in 1994. From then on, he scarcely hopes to 
obtain more than a rise of 0.5 percent in constant francs. Such 
a result would just be acceptable for the Defense Ministry in 
view of the programs already begun and the new operational 
needs. However, at the same time it would be a notable 
exception to the law on controlling public spending.

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- The smuggling and illegal trade 
involving nuclear materials in Germany has risen sharply. 
  Quoting a confidential report by the German Interior 
Ministry, BILD AM SONNTAG reports that the number of attempts to 
make money from the illegal sale of nuclear materials rose to 
123 in 1993. In the previous year only 99 cases had been 
recorded. 
  Last year police made 545 arrests in connection with nuclear 
smuggling. The majority of the perpetrators came from Russia or 
the Czech Republic. In two cases, criminals attempted to 
extract millions [currency not specified] by threatening to 
cause a nuclear explosion. However, the investigations showed 
that both cases were bluffs. The report says the total number 
of offenses involving radioactive materials in 1993 was 240.

  [Text] The federal government is not participating in the 
costs of the French test program for the Phebus research reactor 
in Cadarache, southern France, in which the behavior of 
radioactive fission products will be examined under the 
conditions that would occur in the event of core meltdown 
accidents in light water reactors. These accidents differ 
substantially from the circumstances that caused the catastrophe 
in the completely different type of reactor in Chernobyl, 
according to the reply to a written question from the group 
"Alliance 90/The Greens." The tests were preceded by lengthy 
and thorough preparations and had been approved by the 
authorities. The experimental core meltdown was taking place in 
a test capsule which is placed in the core of the research 
reactor and screened from the effects of heat and pressure. 
According to the federal government, the reactor supplied only 
the neutron radiation of the test capsule required for the 
experiment. The radioactive substances produced in this capsule 
would be discharged from the reactor in pipelines. Their 
behavior would then be examined in pipelines and containers 
representing on a smaller scale the primary circuit and the 
safety vessels of light water reactor nuclear power stations. 
  The experiment was being carried out to identify all the 
chemical and physical processes that are important for fission 
product behavior. The data will be used to test and if 
necessary, improve computer programs with which extremely 
unlikely accident courses with core meltdowns can be described. 
The purpose of these programs was to analyze the cause of 
accidents in nuclear power plants and to assess the efficiency 
of countermeasures. Control over the test procedure would be 
guaranteed by temperature measuring points which do not heat up 
outside the screened test facility. The project is being funded 
by institutions from France (55 percent), Japan, South Korea, 
and the USA (together 15 percent) and the Commission of the 
European Community (30 percent).

<F P=106> [Skjalg Fremo report: "Ban Adopted -- And Forgotten"] </F>
  [Text] Trondheim -- The amendment to the law was meant to 
prohibit Norwegians from acting as intermediaries for sales of 
arms and military equipment from one foreign country to another 
without special permission. 
  The amendment to the law was adopted by the Stortinget 
[Norwegian Parliament] in spring 1990 following rapid 
consideration. However, a formal error in its processing by the 
government meant that the ban first took effect last Friday. 
  The acting press spokesman for the Norwegian Department of 
Foreign Affairs (UD), Arthur Baste Knutsen, told us that the 
fact that the law has only just come into force had no practical 
meaning. 
  "Since the summer the law was adopted, there have not been 
any cases where this legal provision has come into play," Baste 
Knutsen said. 
<H5>  Slip in Minutes </H5>
  The statutory provision, which has not been in application 
for three-and-a-half years after all, is contained in the law 
governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products, 
services, and technology. The Lovdata [legal data] organization 
discovered the formal error, which appears to have been made 
when the new provision was meant to be approved by the king at 
the cabinet meeting held on 22 June 1990. The law was indeed 
approved that day, and the intention was to implement it 
straight away. 
  However, this latter provision was omitted from the minutes 
of the cabinet meeting, probably by error. Consequently, the 
entry into force of the law was not announced in the NORWEGIAN 
LAW NEWS, Lovdata revealed in a letter to the Department of 
Foreign Affairs. 
<H5>  Arms Intermediaries </H5>
  The background to the amendment of the law was an actual 
case 
that came to light in the winter of 1990 when a Norwegian 
company acted as an intermediary selling arms from one country 
to another. The Justice Department discovered that the law in 
force at the time failed to give the Norwegian authorities any 
authority to intervene against such activities -- because it was 
not a question of selling arms, but rather merely acting as an 
intermediary for arms sales. 
  Kjell Magne Bondevik, the foreign minister at the time, 
reacted quickly to close this loophole in a law dating from 1987 
governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products, 
services, and technology. Under the provisions of this law, 
Norwegian citizens must have a special approval to sell arms, 
while simple mediation was not affected. 
  The UD issued a proposal for an amendment to the law on 6 
April 1990. The proposal was adopted by the cabinet that same 
day, and the matter was passed on to the Stortinget. 
  The Norwegian parliament also reacted swiftly. The Committee 
on Foreign Affairs, led by [Prime Minister] Gro Harlem 
Brundtland, issued a unanimously adopted recommendation on 3 May 
1990. Odelstinget [larger division of Norwegian parliament] 
passed a unanimous resolution on 21 May 1990, and Lagtinget 
[smaller division of Norwegian parliament] confirmed this on 29 
May 1990. 
  Evidently, everyone agreed that the mediation of arms sales 
should be monitored. Accordingly, the amendment to the law 
should have been approved by the king in the cabinet. The bill 
states that: "This law shall take effect from a moment to be 
stipulated by the king." In a letter sent to the UD on 18 
February 1994, Lovdata pointed out that no decision had ever 
been made on its entry into force. Consequently, up until now 
it was lawful for Norwegian citizens to act as intermediaries in 
arms sales between one country and another, in direct 
contravention of Stortinget's 1990 resolution.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, Press Association Defence Correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Government tonight insisted it had no plans to 
test nuclear weapons following the United States' announcement 
of an 18-month extension to its testing moratorium until 
September, 1995. 
  President Bill Clinton's decision was based in part on the 
restraint other nuclear powers have shown in resisting pressure 
to resume testing in response to China's test last October. 
  White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Mr Clinton was 
concerned about the impact resumed US nuclear tests would have 
on comprehensive ban talks which opened in January. 
  Britain, which has traditionally relied on testing its 
nuclear warheads in the Nevada Desert, said the moratorium 
extension was not unexpected. 
  "We reaffirm we have no intention of testing while the 
United 
States' moratorium continues," said a Foreign Office spokesman. 
  "And we would also reaffirm our commitment to working with 
energy and speed towards the completion of an effective nuclear 
test ban treaty." 
  When President Clinton first slapped a ban on nuclear 
testing 
in 1992, Britain fiercely resisted the move as three tests were 
planned on Trident warheads "for safety reasons". 
  But the Government has reluctantly accepted that world 
opinion is set against testing and is striving to develop 
computer modelling to simulate the effect of nuclear blasts. 
  The need for testing in any case has eased after the 
Government's decision to scrap plans for a new sub-strategic 
nuclear missile. 
  Instead, Britain is to use a number of Trident missiles 
fitted with single warheads. 
  Thus it is not necessary to develop a new warhead as all the 
Trident missiles -- both strategic and sub-strategic -- will be 
fitted with the same warhead. 
  However, Britain is retaining its capability to design, 
develop and produce new nuclear weapons in the future.

<F P=106> [Charles Clover report: "Nuclear Waste Review Likely To </F>
Delay Sell-off"] 
  [Text] Plans for disposing of nuclear waste, much of it in 
temporary storage at sites around Britain, are to be reviewed, 
possibly delaying privatisation of the nuclear power industry. 
  The plans were strongly criticised by the Government's chief 
safety adviser last year. 
  Mr. Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, who 
has indicated that he wanted to see privatisation before the 
next election, has been pressing for what some officials call a 
"short and dirty" review. 
  This would focus narrowly on the potential commercial 
viability of privatised Pressurised Water Reactors and would 
report by the summer. 
  But Mr John Gummer, Environment Secretary, is adamant that 
the review should cover both long-term liabilities from 
decommissioning nuclear plants -- costing an estimated 20 
billion pounds -- and plans for disposing of nuclear power waste. 
  A remit for the waste review, to be carried out by the 
Department of the Environment, has been long delayed but is now 
expected within weeks. The review would be expected to take 
until the end of the year. 
  Yet some industry observers say Mr. Heseltine must take a 
decision this summer on the sell-off of Nuclear Electric and 
Scottish Nuclear if privatisation is to happen before the next 
election. 
  It was uncertainty about the scale of long-term liabilities 
that led to the nuclear industry being dropped from 
privatisation in 1989. 
  The waste review is likely to focus on plans of the nuclear 
waste agency, Nirex, for a 3 billion pound national nuclear 
waste dump at Sellafield -- and how realistic these are. These 
plans have slipped from around 2003 to after 2010 while waste 
continues to mount at Magnox power stations. 
  The review is also likely to look at costs and strategies 
for 
decommissioning nuclear power stations, many of them closing in 
the next 10 years. This alone will cost up to 10 billion 
pounds. Other liabilities, including disposing of Atomic Energy 
Authority sites and British Nuclear Fuels, bring the total 
closer to 20 billion pounds. 
  Final disposal of waste, which environmentalists say has 
never been properly planned, is expected to cost more than that 
but has never been fully costed. 
  The recent approval given for the British Nuclear Fuels 
Thorp 
plant will probably mean that a lot of extra waste is likely to 
be generated, with nowhere for it to go. 
  Last autumn Prof John Horlock, departing chairman of the 
Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations, 
criticised the quantities of waste piling up at power stations 
and nuclear stores. He called on the Government to ensure that 
the Nirex waste repository proposed for Sellafield came into 
operation earlier than 2010. 
  It is not known if the review will cover reprocessing or dry 
storage. If it were to do so, it would be a new blow to British 
Nuclear Fuels which has just won a 16-year battle to open its 
Thorp reprocessing plant: dry storage is seen by many as a 
cheaper option than reprocessing. 
  Nuclear analysts reacted without surprise to the news of a 
nuclear waste review. 
  Mr. Gordon MacKerron, senior fellow at the Science Policy 
Research Unit at Sussex University, said: "There is a clear 
public perception that our nuclear waste disposal policy is in a 
complete mess." 
  "Nuclear Electric will want the Government to clear up all 
the historic liabilities because it is clear that the City does 
not want to take them on." 
  A spokesman for Nuclear Electric disputed whether a waste 
review would mean delay for privatisation.

<F P=106> [Press statement issued by a spokesman for the DPRK Atomic </F>
Energy General Bureau in Pyongyang on 18 March -- first 
paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] In connection with the fact that the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat has unjustifiably 
assessed [pudanghage pyongga] the results of its inspections of 
our nuclear facilities [haeksisol], a spokesman for the DPRK 
Atomic Energy General Bureau [chongguk] has released the 
following press statement [tamhwa]: 
  Press statement by a spokesman for the DPRK Atomic Energy 
General Bureau. 
  According to the 25 February letter of agreement at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, we received inspections from the 
IAEA for ensuring the continuity of safeguards on 1-15 March. 
  The recent inspections were designed to purely ensure the 
continuity of safeguards [sunsu tamboui yonsoksongul 
pojanghanunde] in conformity with the special status [tuksuhan 
chiwi] in which our country had temporarily suspended the 
effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
  In the negotiations in Vienna with us on 15 February, the 
agency's Secretariat admitted that the inspections were for 
ensuring the continuity of safeguards and agreed on the scope of 
such inspections. 
  Therefore, throughout the period after we received the 
inspection team, out of a desire to sincerely implement the 
DPRK-U.S. agreement and the agreement between us and the IAEA, 
we allowed all activities necessary to ensure the continuity of 
safeguards and positively cooperated with the inspection team's 
work. As a result, the agency's inspection team was able to 
satisfactory carry out all activities pointed out in the 15 
February Vienna agreement, including replacing and maintaining 
[chongbi] sealing and surveillance devices [pongswae mit 
kamsisudan], examining inventories [chaegoryang], examining 
[komto] various documents, verifying design information [solgye 
tongbo], and obtaining and measuring samples [siryo chaechwi mit 
chukchong]. 
  Nevertheless, during the period of the recent inspections, 
the agency's Secretariat and the inspection team unilaterally 
insisted that the inspections were not inspections for ensuring 
the continuity of safeguards but inspections under the 
safeguards accord. And, quite contrary to the 15 February 
Vienna agreement, they put forth an unreasonable request for 
inspections syaing that this is almost tantamount to regular and 
irregular inspections [chinan iwol siboil wien habui 
naeyonggwanun simhui ogunnage chonggi mit pijonggi sachare 
matmongnun murihan yogurul tulgo nawatta]. 
  Not keeping with the Vienna agreement, the IAEA Secretariat 
gave directions [chiryong] to the inspection team, and taking 
the inspection team's incorrect report [kuruttoen pogo] as an 
established fact, it insisted on unfair demands, including the 
issues of extracting samples from places where seals, which are 
locking devices, remained untouched; gamma measuring of all 
parts, not selected spots; and checking of the cooling system, 
which was not even mentioned in the Vienna negotiations. 
  The IAEA Secretariat continued to intimidate us by sending 
three telex messages saying if its demands were not fulfilled, 
it would report to the Board of Governors that it could not 
confirm nuclear materials were not used for other purposes. 
  On the other hand, when the members of the inspection team 
in 
our country could not make any more objections to the 
administrators' logical explanation regarding the extraction of 
samples from places where seals were maintained, they made an 
excuse that they had no choice but to carry out the task 
[extracting samples] because it was assigned by the IAEA 
Secretariat. Even after personally confirming that the seals 
they put themselves in August 1993 remained untouched, they made 
an absurd assertion that they could not trust the seals because 
they were over a year old. 
  The IAEA Secretariat's unfair demands, including the sample 
extraction from the inlet measurement tank [ipku kyeryang tank] 
locked by IAEA's seals, have nothing to do with the objective 
and nature of the inspection -- which was to check that no 
nuclear activities had been carried out -- but are a grave 
violation [omjunghan wiban] of the agreement reached in Vienna 
on 15 February. 
  We have even shown a good intention by flexibly carrying out 
the IAEA's unreasonable [murihan] demands, including the issues 
of extracting samples from some places where sealing devices are 
installed and measuring gamma from all necessary places. Since 
it is so, the recent nuclear inspection activities carried out 
by a IAEA inspection team are sufficient to confirm that nuclear 
materials from our nuclear facilities are not used for other 
purposes and to firmly ensure the continuity of safeguards. 
  In fact, these facilities were blocked doubly and triply as 
the gate of the radiochemical laboratory and major processes 
[kongjong] were frozen [tonggyol] with numerous seals, 
surveillance cameras, and marks of the IAEA. 
  Nonetheless, the IAEA Secretariat, even before analyzing the 
results of the inspections, made an unjust assessment that it 
cannot guarantee that nuclear materials were not used for other 
purpose at these facilities because some inspection activities 
were restricted at the radiochemical laboratory, even though 
many inspection activities were carried out in accordance with 
the Vienna agreement. In connection with this, the IAEA is 
causing a stir that it will convene a meeting of the IAEA Board 
of Governors. 
  This is an utterly unjust act of openly turning over the 
agreement reached with the United States and with the IAEA on 
ensuring the continuity of safeguards, and can never be 
justified under any circumstances. 
  All these facts prove that the IAEA Secretariat attempts to 
widen the scope of unjustness and, under the U.S. manipulation, 
invariably pursues sinister political aims to crush [apsal] us. 
  If the IAEA Secretariat truly hopes for a fair solution of 
our nuclear problem, it should withdraw its unjust hasty 
assessment on the results of the recent inspections 
  We will watch the attitude the IAEA Secretariat will assume 
at the upcoming Board of Governors meeting. Based on this, we 
will judge whether it intends to resolve our nuclear issue 
fairly or attempts to use this for political aims. 
  If the IAEA Secretariat again tries to agitate the unjust 
pressure commotions against us by finding faults with us, we 
will have no choice but to respond to this with a resolute 
measure [manil kukchewonjaryokkiku sogigugi urirul 
kolgodulmyonso ttodasi uriege pudanghan amnyoksodongul polliryo

  [Editorial Report] ROK vernacular newspapers publish on 18 
March articles and editorials reacting to the assessment made by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the inspections 
of the North Korean nuclear facilities. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word 
article by reporter Pak Tu-sik on the ROK Government's moves. 
The article reports government authorities were "quite at a 
loss" with the IAEA report and "the trend is leaning toward the 
inevitability of referring the issue to the UN Security Council." 
  The article notes that the government showed an attitude 
quite different from previous ones quoting Nuclear Ambassador 
Kim Samhun as saying: "Our patience has come to a limit. We 
doubt if North Korea is a dialogue partner." The article 
analyzes that such a shift to a hard-line position was based on 
the judgment that only "dialogue with sanctions" could solve the 
problem. 
  CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article on U.S. 
reaction by correspondent Chong Hae-yong from Washington. 
Describing that "the United States is enraged and embarrassed to 
be cheated again," the article reports that although voices 
demanding stronger measures are increasing, the U.S. Government 
will not completely close down the communication channel with 
North Korea but seek a resolution through dialogue while 
pressing it with UN sanctions. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 2 a 500-word 
article on the background and prospects of the IAEA Board of 
Governors' special meeting by correspondent Kim Uk-hui from 
Bonn. While expecting a strong IAEA resolution against North 
Korea, the article speculates that the IAEA will not immediately 
announce that the continuity of safeguards has been broken and 
impose sanctions. The article expects that "the resolution will 
focus on demanding additional inspections." 
  TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article by 
reporter Kim Cha-su analyzing ROK Government's view on the 
nuclear issue. The article says the government is preparing to 
resume the Team Spirit exercise and expedite the deployment of 
Patriot missiles. The article also reports that a government 
official explained that "dialogue is meaningless under the 
situation in which the international community is heading for 
ultra-hard measures." 
  The article also speculates that North Korea might not come 
to the 19 March North-South working-level contact for the 
special envoy exchange due to the ROK Government's drastic 
change of attitude. 
  TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article on 
Washington's view on the IAEA inspection results by 
correspondent Nam Chan-sun from Washington. The article reports 
there are various analyses as to why North Korea had not open 
the radiochemical laboratory. One of them is that North Korea 
intended to use the last inspection during the special envoy 
exchange negotiation or the third-round of talks with the United 
States to do so. Another is that North Korea really has 
something to hide. The article says "if the latter is the case, 
the nuclear negotiation will completely fall into a deadlock 
which can only be resolved by a dramatic change of North Korea's 
attitude." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "Is There Any Way To Secure North 
Korea's Cooperation?" The editorial says it is time that the 
ROK Government develop more effective measures to deal with the 
North Korean nuclear issue. Stressing that "the most imperative 
goal of North Korea at the moment is to maintain its 
establishment," the editorial says the ROK Government should 
first decide whether it wants to support or interfere with North 
Korea's efforts to maintain its establishment in order to 
develop a strong initiative for the negotiation. 
  SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 an 1,200-word article by 
correspondent Yi Kyong-hyong from Washington on the U.S. view. 
Along with an ultimatum for the complete acceptance of nuclear 
inspections, the article expects that "the United States will 
exercise various types of pressures including the deployment of 
Patriot missiles and the mobilization of the aircraft carrier 
currently conducting sea exercises in the north Pacific." The 
article states that "the U.S. pressure will still be based on 
its policy to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue." 
  The article also expects that UN sanctions will not 
immediately begin with ultra-hard ones but be taken in a phased 
manner. 
  SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article by 
reporter Yi Sung-chol on ROK Government's view. The article 
contends that the government believes that the direction for the 
resolution of the nuclear issue should be changed now but would 
still like to wait to see how serious the IAEA was when it said 
the inspections were "insufficient" and continue with dialogue 
effort. 
  SEOUL SINMUN also publishes on page 5 an 800-word article by 
reporter Yu Se-chin on the IAEA view. Noting that the 
inspection result, which is usually announced two weeks later, 
was announced only one day after the inspection team returned, 
the article reports that "this implies the suspicion over 
military use of nuclear material is very serious." The article 
also speculates that the IAEA "was prepared" for the negative 
result. 
  The article says the only choice left for the IAEA is to 
refer the issue to the UN Security Council after giving North 
Korea one last chance to unconditionally accept thorough 
inspections. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "Wake Up From Fantasy of North 
Korea." The editorial says "the broken seals no doubt mean that 
North Korea used nuclear material for other purposes" and urges 
both ROK and U.S. Governments to stop mollifying North Korea 
because "Pyongyang will never come back to shake hands." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article 
by 
reporter Yi Sung-chol reporting that "the moderate Foreign 
Ministry wants the resumption of Team Spirit exercise to be 
announced after a final conclusion is reached that the North 
Korean nuclear issue can no longer be resolved through dialogue 
while the hard-line National Defense Ministry wants the decision 
made based on the result of IAEA special 21 March Board of 
Governors meeting." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,000-word article 
by 
correspondent Yi Chong-yon from Washington reporting that 
hard-line voice is again rising in the United States. The 
article reports that "diplomatic sources in Washington expect a 
dramatic change of attitude from North Korea around Kim 
Il-song's birthday, which falls on 15 April." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 700-word article on 
the prospects of the 21 March IAEA Board of Governors special 
meeting by correspondent Son Tong-u from Bonn. Noting that the 
two undeclared facilities had not been included in the check 
list of the recent inspection, the article says that it is clear 
that the IAEA is conducting the inspection in accordance with 
"political negotiations" and therefore "the IAEA is not expected 
to take a decisive countermeasure during the 21 March meeting."

  [Text] Today an agreement was signed between the 
governments of Kazakhstan and Japan with regard to cooperation 
in elimination of the nuclear weapons due to be dismantled in 
the Republic of Kazakhstan as well as setting up of a 
cooperation committee for this purpose. The document was signed 
by Foreign Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov and the Ambassador of 
Japan to Kazakhstan. This is a comment given by the Kazakh 
minister : 
  [Begin Suleymenov recording] We have signed an agreement 
with 
[word indistinct] and the Lisbon Protocol in accordance with 
which we are a part of an agreement [words indistinct] weapons 
which we have inherited from the former USSR. 
  We need tremendous sums of money for which our young 
republic 
has no finance, and our economy can not cope with it. The 
agreement we have just signed represents good will on the part 
of the Japanese government and the Japanese nation who put 
forward this initiative to Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and 
Kazakhstan and which want to render financial assistance, to 
participate in the process of elimination of nuclear weapons 
located on these territories. 
  The Japanese government is allocating a total of about $100 
million for all four states - for Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, 
and Belarus. Kazakhstan was the last to sign this agreement. 
In the near future, at the end of this month, the Japanese 
government will examine the matter. The share to be received by 
each country will depend on the decision taken by the Japanese 
government. We cannot say now whether these shares will be 
equal. It will depend on the country, on the type of nuclear 
weapons in these states, and the expenses connected with 
dismantling. [words indistinct] 
  Besides, it is essential for Kazakhstan that this agreement 
envisages facilitation in tackling relevant environmental 
problems in the area of deployment and testing of nuclear 
weapons. In particular, this relates to the Semipalatinsk 
region. 
  In the second half of March a group of experts of the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry is expected to visit Almaty to study 
the problem in full detail and meet relevant ministries and 
departments. This is a positive development on the eve of the 
official visit to Japan by our president in the first 10 days of 
April.

<F P=106> [Michael Bond report: "Europe Alert Over Threat of Nuclear </F>
Terrorism"] 
  [Text] London -- Security forces in both western and 
eastern Europe are combining their efforts to tackle the growing 
menace of nuclear smuggling from countries of the former Soviet 
Union -- described by NATO as one of the greatest threats to 
international security since the end of the Cold War. 
  Interpol, the international police agency, has now set up a 
specialised group, involving police forces in 24 European 
nations, THE EUROPEAN has learnt. Border guards and Customs 
officers in Poland, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Sweden have 
been equipped with radiation detectors and are being taught how 
to handle radioactive substances. 
  A senior Interpol officer, Hiroaki Takizawa, based at Lyon, 
said: "There is growing concern in European countries about 
nuclear smuggling. Our main problem is the lack of information. 
This is a new sort of crime -- we do not yet know who is 
smuggling the material, who is buying it, and why." 
  Nuclear smuggling has become an increasingly lucrative 
business for professional dealers, but for the couriers and 
those who steal the material it is a dangerous -- even lethal -- 
game. Several have been caught carrying highly radioactive 
metals in their shirt pockets or strapped to their bodies. A 
Polish man died after carrying plutonium powder to Germany in 
his navel. "Most of the thieves are cowboys," said one 
investigator working in Moscow. "They have no idea they are 
dealing with highly dangerous substances." 
  Police in Germany, the country most commonly used to smuggle 
the material into the West, have registered nearly 350 cases of 
the illegal export of plutonium and other radioactive substances 
from the former Soviet Union in the past two years. They blame 
the burgeoning trade on falling security standards at former 
Soviet nuclear installations. 
  Interpol says radioactive material has been stolen from a 
vast range of sources. Russian authorities themselves have 
reported that during 1993 there were 900 attempts to gain 
illegal entry to nuclear installations, and a further 700 cases 
of workers trying to smuggle out materials. An investigator 
based in Moscow said: "There are wild rumours in Russia that it 
is possible to make money out of anything if it is radioactive. 
People are stealing from everywhere from waste dumps to medical 
laboratories." 
  Though there is no evidence that any nuclear substances have 
fallen into the hands of terrorists, and much of the stolen 
material would be useless for making weapons, a leaked report 
completed earlier this year by the German secret service 
identified potential customers. These included "two extremist 
Islamic fundamentalist groups". 
  It said there were "credible intelligence indications that 
high-ranking persons in ministries, embassies, industrial firms 
and research facilities" in eastern Europe were involved in 
nuclear smuggling. 
  The dismantling of nuclear arms in Russia and Ukraine over 
the next decade will produce a surplus of about 50 tonnes of 
virtually pure weapons-grade plutonium. Security officials fear 
some of this will fall into the hands of a rogue government or 
terrorist group, but they also point out that many other types 
of nuclear material can be lethal in the wrong hands. 
  Interpol is treating 30 nuclear smuggling cases as extremely 
serious but this could be just "the tip of the iceberg". Among 
cases being investigated are: 
  1. 250kg of uranium taken from a plant at Glazov. 
  2. 123 grammes of uranium stolen from Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant by an employee last October. 
  3. 260 lead boxes containing several hundred grammes of 
uranium from Kazakhstan. Six Ukrainians were arrested with them 
on the Moldovan border in December. In the capital of Moldova a 
lawyer was awaiting the delivery, for which he was due to pay 
$1.2 million. This uranium was 80 per cent enriched -- virtually 
weapons-grade. It takes just 7kg of weapons-grade material to 
make a nuclear bomb.

<F P=106> ["enn"-signed report: "Reequipment of Nuclear Power Plants </F>
Necessary"] 
  [Excerpt] Braunlage, 16 March -- Heinrich von Pierer, 
chairman of the board of directors of Siemens AG, has suggested 
German-French cooperation in reequipping nuclear power plants in 
the CIS. The condition of the Soviet-type facilities is 
alarming, Pierer said at the RWE [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches 
Elektrizitaetswerk] "Energy" Workshop in Braunlage. The safety 
standard is low and, in addition, the importance of safety is 
judged differently than in Western Europe. In some places, 
reactors are kept on line even though safety problems would 
require a shutdown. In addition, spare parts are missing and 
the operating crews are often unmotivated. Due to the 
geographic closeness, the European neighbors must be interested 
in improving the power plants, Pierer said. 
  A German-French alliance could form the core of a European 
initiative -- for instance, together with the Swedes and the 
Finnish -- in order to provide financial and technical "help for 
self-help" to the CIS. Some nuclear power plants must be closed 
down for good and, therefore, replacements must be established. 
Pierer said that in this connection, he is primarily thinking 
of the new construction of conventional gas power plants. In 
Central and Eastern Europe, there are still 58 Soviet-type 
nuclear power plants in operation at the moment, 15 of them are 
of the Chernobyl type. The Siemens director estimates the costs 
for reequipment at 12-14 billion German marks. However, 
equipment for only 4 billion marks would have to be imported; 
the large remaining part could come from CIS production.

  [Text] A 29-man North Korean military delegation led by Cho 
Myong-nok, commander of the North Korean Air Force, returned 
home last week from its long visit to Iran for the promotion of 
Iranian-North Korean military and nuclear cooperation, agreeing 
on the promotion of mutual military, nuclear cooperation, an 
Arab weekly published in Paris reported. 
  AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI reported that the North Korean delegation 
consisting of experts in military technology returned home after 
signing an agreement for the promotion of new military, nuclear 
cooperation with Iran, but did not provide details. 
  North Korean government news agency KCNA reported on 12 
January that the North Korean delegation led by Commander Cho 
Myong-nok was visiting Teheran but neglected to mention the 
purpose of the delegation's visit to Iran. The Iranian 
Government press made no mention of the North Korean 
delegation's visit to Iran. 
  The Western and Arab sources reported that during the North 
Korean delegation's visit to Iran, the two sides probably 
conducted intense discussion on the issue of test launches in 
Iran of the Nodong-1 medium-range missiles that have been 
developed by North Korea with Iran's financial assistance. 
  Diplomatic sources speculated that the North Korean 
delegation may have visited Iranian military and nuclear 
facilities, including the (Shard) missile test base located 320 
kms east of Teheran.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb 24 (AFP) -- Iran never has and never 
will allow North Korea to test missiles on its soil, the head of 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards General Mohsen Reza'i vowed in an 
interview published Thursday [24 February]. 
  Speaking to the English-language daily Tehran Times, Reza'i 
denied Western reports that his country let the hardline 
communist state to test-fire a medium range missile in Iran. 
  "We are very sensitive to having our soil and military 
facilities used by foreigners," he said. "Iran will never opt 
for such cooperation no matter how friendly the countries are." 
  Western newspapers and several military officials have 
charged that North Korea would test the missile, named the 
Nodong-2. 
  Reza'i revealed Tehran had turned down repeated requests 
from 
Russia to sell it US-made F-14 jet fighters and wire-guided 
anti-tank missiles (TOW), "despite the enmity between Iran and 
the United States." 
  The Islamic republic also refused to deliver to the United 
States a Soviet-made T-72 tank, seized from Iraqi forces during 
the war, as requested by Washington "through various channels," 
he said. 
  The general denied as "rumor and baseless" Western charges 
that Iran tried to acquire nuclear weapons. "Political logic, 
moral concerns and world realities stop us from trying to have 
such deadly weapons." 
  Pyongyang, a main supplier of arms to Iran during its 
1980-1988 war with Iraq, is suspected by the West of offering to 
provide Tehran with 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) range Nodong-1 
missiles, and to help in nuclear research. 
  Iran has repeatedly denied the charges, insisting that 
contacts between the two countries are limited to economic 
cooperation.

  [Text] Prague, Feb 22 (CTK) -- Industry and Trade Minister 
Vladimir Dlouhy told CTK today that so far no one has discussed 
the possibility of exporting spare parts for Czech-made T-72 
tanks to Iran. 
  The current issue of the political weekly RESPEKT reports 
that in January, Jan Vlcek, director of the arms maker 
consortium the RDP Group, wrote to Dlouhy to ask for his help in 
obtaining a license to export arms to Iran. 
  According to RESPEKT, Dlouhy sent Vlcek's letter to the 
Defense, Interior and Foreign Ministries and is still awaiting 
their replies before commenting definitively. 
  The letter also mentioned financial advantages for the Czech 
Republic in such a deal. The project would last for five years 
and bring in about $500 million, an amount that would help 
rejuvenate stagnant arms makers supplying components for the 
T-72. 
  This could also "fundamentally influence the employment 
situation, especially in the Moravian region," Vlcek said in 
this letter. It would also activate the arms industry in 
general and open the way to cooperation between Czech 
manufacturers and those in NATO countries. 
  The Czech Republic has announced its desire to become a full 
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance as soon as possible.

  [Text] The government plans to propose to the United States 
that Korean and U.S. atomic energy corporations advance to China 
and Southeast Asian nations in consortia. 
  Such consortia would have competitive advantages in Asia 
when 
they put to use Korea's knowhow in the fields of the 
construction and operation of nuclear power plants in 
combination with core technologies of U.S. corporations, the 
Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said yesterday. 
  Cooperation in nuclear energy in third countries will be one 
of the most important agenda items at a bilateral conference on 
energy and environment scheduled for tomorrow and Saturday, the 
ministry said. 
  Korea is self-reliant for 93 percent of technology required 
for the construction of nuclear power plant, the ministry said. 
  The Korean delegation headed by Kim Tae-kon, assistant 
minister for energy and resources, will also propose the import 
of energy-saving and recycling technology from the United States 
and the dispatch of energy experts to Korea, it said. 
  The United States will be represented by John Riggs, 
principal deputy assistant secretary for policy, planning and 
program evaluation at the Department of Energy.

Nuclear Reactor as a research facility. 
  The French decision was made on the basis of a report from a 
public hearing into reopening the facility near Grenoble which 
ceased operating as a fast breeder reactor in 1990. 
  The report said the reactor could serve as a facility for 
experiments into nuclear waste reduction as well as leaving open 
the option of using it as a fast breeder reactor in the future. 
  An official at the agency said the continued use by France 
of 
its Super Phenix Reactor, even as a nuclear waste burning 
facility, would at least spare Japan from being put in a 
position where it is the only country outside Russia with a 
similar facility. 
  A plan also exists for Japan's Monju prototype fast breeder 
reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, to conduct experiments in 
waste incineration after it reaches criticality in April. 
  The plan is likely to be incorporated in the nation's 
long-term plan for nuclear power development now under revision. 
  Japan's nuclear power policy emphasizes the development of 
fast breeder technology.

  [Text] On 1 March, the government decided to actively move 
in building nuclear power plants in China. 
  According to materials submitted to the National Assembly by 
the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, the government 
plans to widen the scope of the move into China after forming 
the foundation through technological trainings on and advisory 
support in building and operating nuclear power plants, aiming 
at the ultimate goal of plant exports to China. 
  To achieve this goal, the government has decided to hasten 
the conclusion of an ROK-PRC nuclear energy treaty, which is now 
being negotiated, and as well as make efforts to conclude the 
"ROK-PRC Industrial Cooperation Treaty," which will practically 
back domestic companies' move into building nuclear power plants 
in China, before the end of this year. 
  The government also plans to unify channels for this and 
make 
a single one to prevent excessive competition among domestic 
companies in building nuclear power plants in China and to build 
a complementary cooperation system. It also decided to seek 
methods of forming a consortium with foreign professional 
companies, if necessary. 
  If negotiations with China are being held smoothly, with 
President Kim Yong-sam's China visit as a momentum, it will 
become possible to promote this by field, such as plant and 
system design (The Technology and Atomic Energy Institute of the 
Korea Electric Power Corporation [KEPOC]), manufacturing of 
machines and materials (Korea Heavy Industries and private 
enterprises), operation and maintenance (KEPOC), and 
construction (private enterprises).

<F P=106> [Report by Marichu A. Villanueva] </F>
  [Text] The Senate yesterday ratified two Philippine 
treaties with India which will ease the exchange of economic and 
technical information and enhance the transfer of technology 
between the two countries. 
  Senator Blas Ople, chairman of the Senate foreign relations 
committee, secured the passage in second reading of the two 
Philippines-lndia treaties, bringing to 25 the total number of 
treaties so far ratified by the Senate since the 9th Congress 
started in July, 1992. 
  Ople also pushed for the Senate ratification of the 
Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the 
Convention on Assisting in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or 
Radiological Emergency. 
  In his sponsorship speech for the Senate concurrence of the 
two Conventions related to nuclear accidents, Ople cited that 
this international agreement will place the Philippines within 
the protective umbrella of an international commitment to 
provide assistance in case of nuclear accidents. 
  The first treaty with India concurred in by the Senate, 
involves economic and technical cooperation in research and 
design, delivery and installation of plants, machineries and 
equipment and technical assistance in the field of industrial 
research, nuclear energy, engineering, telecommunications, 
agricultural and industrial research. 
  The other treaty with India ratified by the Senate calls for 
the scientific and technological cooperation which provide for 
the exchange of scholars, training programs and information 
exchange on metallurgy, silkworm culture, textile development, 
and low level technology which could be applied to countryside 
development program. 
  Ople said that even before the two treaties were ratified by 
the Senate, the Philippines and India have already put them into 
effect when Filipino scholars and trainees went to India to 
participate in research programs in agriculture, nuclear energy 
generation, industrial chemicals and health programs. 
  Meanwhile, Ople urged his colleagues at the Senate to also 
ratify with dispatch the two Conventions related to nuclear 
accident in the light of dangers it poses to mankind. 
  Ople specifically pointed out the presence of nuclear 
reactors in neighboring countries of the Philippines within the 
500 miles range. 
  These countries, he said, include Taiwan which is 240 
kilometers from Laoag, 795 kilometers from Manila with six 
nuclear reactors in operation and is building two more, Japan 
has 42 nuclear power plants, including two fueled by "highly 
dangerous" plutonium; China has one nuclear power plant and 10 
research reactors; South Korea has five nuclear reactors, and 
North Korea with seven nuclear reactors and which continues to 
resist UN inspection on the real status of its nuclear 
facilities. 
  Under the two Conventions in which the Philippines is a 
signatory, the government would be in a position to demand from 
the erring country, through the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) or its neighbor for technical and technological 
assistance to prevent the effects of radiation from nuclear 
accidents. 
  "The early notification would allow us to protect our people 
and our land from the spreading nuclear poison," Ople pointed 
out. 
  "It is imperative that we become a party to these two 
conventions," he stressed. 
  Ople recalled the Chernobyl accident in Russia where 
radioactive emissions were wind-carried to neighboring countries 
and demonstrated to the world the horrors of a nuclear accident.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 3 KYODO -- An international science and 
technology center set up in Moscow to stem the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons technology and expertise from the former Soviet 
Union formally began functioning Thursday [3 March], Japanese 
government officials said. 
  The center will offer peaceful research projects to 
scientists and technicians of the former Soviet Union who have 
expertise in weapons of mass destruction and missile guidance 
systems. 
  Aside from its other role as a source of funds, the center 
will monitor the various assigned projects to ensure their 
peaceful objectives. 
  Officials said the idea is to keep economically troubled 
former Soviet scientists and technicians from selling their 
expertise to the highest bidder, including such states as North 
Korea and Iraq. 
  The center was established by agreement among Russia, the 
United States, the European Union and Japan.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunaiskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 26 TASS -- The Russian Defence 
Ministry is preparing an adequate substantiation for a Russian 
programme to destroy chemical weapons. 
  Commenting on aspects of this programme in Saturday's issue 
of the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper, Chief of the General Staff of 
Russian Armed Forces Mikhail Kolesnikov noted that the Russian 
Defence Ministry is the state customer of work on the 
development of ecologically safe technologies for the 
destruction (utilisation) of chemical weapons. 
  According to the general, the Defence Ministry uses the 
principles of openness to choose adequate technologies, 
discusses, together with representatives from various regions, 
sections of the draft programme which are of interest to them. 
  The ministry actively helps the mass media and scientific 
publications in describing various aspects of chemical weapons' 
destruction. "The time of taking "hush-hush" decisions has gone 
long ago," the general staff chief stressed. 
  According to Kolesnikov, the production of chemical weapons 
in the former Soviet Union was discontinued in 1987 and has 
never been resumed. Their stockpiles were not replenished and 
not updated. 
  He stressed that the stockpiles of chemical weapons in 
Russia 
are under 40,000 tonnes by weight of toxic agents and are housed 
at seven arsenals specially equipped for their safe and reliable 
storage. 
  Russia will carry out the destruction of chemical weapons 
only at specially built facilities, the location of which will 
be determined by a government commission set up by the Russian 
president's decision of August 9, 1993, Kolesnikov continued. 
  In the general's opinion, "the safety of population and 
environment is the guiding condition for destruction." For this 
purpose, the Defence Ministry closely cooperates with regional 
and republican supervision bodies to conduct monitoring of 
public health and to take samples from surrounding terrain. 
  Such work has already been done near the city of Kambarkiy 
(Udmurtia), in the Krasnopartizanskiy (Gornyy village) and 
Volskiy (Shikhaniy village) districts of the Saratov region. 
  Skilled medics are invited to participate in this work. The 
results of population's medical checkups are reported to regions 
where this work is done.

<F P=106> [Report by Riyad 'Alam-al-Din in Beirut and Nayil Mukhaybar </F>
in Paris] 
  [Text] A few days ago several western European intelligence 
agencies received a top secret report warning of armed squads 
arriving in some countries and preparing to carry out armed 
operations in coordination with fundamentalist cells and 
underground organizations supervised and financed by Iran. The 
report urged the countries concerned to adopt the most stringent 
precautionary measures in anticipation of an international plot 
with many scenarios that could be implemented by citizens of 
different nationalities and cover a large number of European 
states, headed by Germany and France. 
  The report noted that crucial meetings were held several 
weeks ago in Tehran for this purpose at the Iranian foreign 
intelligence headquarters in Firuzi Palace. The meetings were 
attended by representatives of the world's most dangerous armed 
factions and movements, including the Fatah-Revolutionary 
Council led by Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna]; the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command; the Japanese Red 
Army; the Irish Republican Army; the Armenian Secret Army 
represented by a woman close to its leader, Hakopian, who was 
assassinated in Athens in 1986; the Lebanese Revolutionary 
Organization established by Murshid Shabu; and the Lebanese 
Hizballah. 
  These organizations were represented by senior officials who 
were responding to an invitation by a high-ranking Iranian 
authority eager to gather in Tehran an assortment of the world's 
most prominent armed networks. It has been learned that Mohsen 
Reza'i, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards 
(Pasdaran); Mohammad Musavi, the information official at the 
Iranian Embassy in Beirut; other leaders of the Iranian hardline 
trend; and coordinators of international armed squads 
participated in these meetings. 
<H5>  A Unified Command and Commandos </H5>
  The report, abridged copies of which were received by 
several 
western European intelligence agencies that follow Iranian moves 
closely, revealed that the meetings focused on the establishment 
of a unified command by Iran for these factions and the 
preparation of a plan to disperse these networks in most 
countries of the world, where they would be ready to strike at 
U.S. and European interests and assassinate politicians and 
diplomats upon receiving a codeword from Iran. This would 
happen if Iran were to be exposed to any attack or international 
blockade or threats seeking to tighten the stranglehold on it, 
increase its political and economic isolation, and provoke 
disturbances and internal strife that endanger its security and 
order. 
  In fact, many intelligence agencies had been following 
Iranian secret moves with great concern since the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord in Washington on 13 September. Since that 
time, these agencies have noticed suspicious activities by 
international networks, Palestinian factions, and fundamentalist 
organizations and movements opposed to the accord. The thread 
of all these activities led to Iran. Then the meetings and 
visits began to intensify. At these meetings, hosted by Tehran, 
plans were drawn up to establish a front opposed to the 
Gaza-Jericho accord that would seek to thwart the accord by 
force. Information indicates that a reward of several million 
dollars was set for anyone who would assassinate Abu-'Ammar 
[Yasir 'Arafat] and that Iran utilized all its ties and contacts 
with the international networks to have them participate in a 
plot starting at the Arab level and ending at the international 
level. Even mercenaries of various nationalities were recruited 
to facilitate this mission and divert suspicion. 
  In recent weeks European intelligence organs have become 
convinced that armed operations will be carried out at a growing 
pace. These organs received information that acts of opposition 
to the Palestinian-Israeli accord, which have begun in the 
occupied territories, will gradually evolve into operations 
covering the entire Palestinian arena, then Lebanon, and later 
will shift to other locations in the world, specifically Europe. 
  This information adds that Iran has opened its army camps, 
especially (Karnaji) near Qom, to commandos from the General 
Command, Hizballah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. They received 
special training by Iranian Revolutionary Guards officers. At 
the same time, Tehran has asked Sudan to open its camps for 
training special units of "Afghan Arabs" and fundamentalist 
exiles living in European countries. In Lebanon, increasing 
activity has been observed in Hizballah camps in the western 
al-Biqa' where Iranian military advisers have been training 
fundamentalist elements who arrived recently from several Arab 
states in guerrilla warfare, the use of explosives, and car 
bombings. Intelligence reports have emphasized the presence of 
elements from the Japanese Red Army in al-Biqa' and Beirut. 
Those elements have been dispersed in Popular Front-General 
Command centers and camps in al-Biqa'. These reports say that 
the Japanese Red Army elements entered Lebanon with the 
assistance of the Iranian Embassy and under the supervision of 
"N.N." who works in the foreign operations branch of the Iranian 
foreign intelligence service, headed by 'Ali Fallahian. 
Meanwhile, Asadollah Reza 'Asaker, the Revolutionary Guard 
official in Lebanon, has intensified his secret meetings with 
the commanders of Hizballah's internal and external operations 
units. 
<H5>  Activating the European Networks </H5>
  About two weeks ago Western intelligence organs that 
coordinate anti-terrorist operations within the framework of a 
special secret plan codenamed "Kilowatt," which covers more than 
20 Western countries, received reports from their agents in the 
Middle East -- who work in full coordination with their 
counterparts in the region -- urging them to forestall 
derailment of the peace process. Those reports stated that the 
codeword was sent out at the recent meeting in Firuzi Palace and 
that the dispersal of armed networks' elements throughout the 
world had begun, accompanied by "important orders." Apparently, 
the uncovering of a plot prepared by a group affiliated with the 
Abu-Nidal Organization to assassinate an Arab official during 
his participation at the Nonaligned summit in India in the 
middle of this month is part of the international terrorist 
conspiracy hatched in Tehran. The disclosure of the arrival in 
India at the end of last month of Fatah-Revolutionary Council 
groups induced most Western countries, which received 
information about the Tehran mobilization meetings of armed 
fundamentalist, radical, leftist, and separatist movements from 
different countries, to declare a state of maximum alert in 
their security and intelligence organs. In fact, reports from 
several European countries, including France and Germany, 
indicated that suspicious movements by radical networks and 
elements had been observed in their territory and that work had 
begun to reorganize, revive, and activate existing Iranian 
networks in preparation for implementing fresh missions and 
operations. 
  It has been learned that al-Haj "'A.J.," who is Lebanese and 
a Hizballah security official, moved three weeks ago to Iran and 
held intensive meetings with Iranian security officials aimed at 
forming and organizing terrorist networks in a number of 
European countries, especially Germany, a country that is 
well-known to him and in which he had participated in organizing 
several operations. Many meetings have reportedly been held in 
Tehran between this security official and 'Imad Maghniyah, one 
of Hizballah's most prominent elements, whose name was mentioned 
in the kidnapping of Western hostages in Beirut alongside that 
of "'A.J." 
  It is common knowledge that Maghniyah lives in Tehran and 
holds an Iranian diplomatic passport. Western intelligence 
reports mention him as general coordinator of the recently 
reorganized networks in Europe.

  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 14 KYODO -- Iran is attempting to 
mobilize the Japanese Red Army and Islamic guerrilla groups for 
joint assassination missions and other terrorist acts in the 
United States and Europe, a pro-Jordanian daily in Jerusalem 
reported Sunday. 
  The Red Army and several Islamic guerrilla groups met 
several 
weeks ago at the Tehran headquarters of the Iranian intelligence 
service, the Arab-language AN-NAHAR said, quoting intelligence 
organs in several European countries. 
  The dispatch from Paris said Iran is hoping to disrupt the 
Middle East peace talks because it fears isolation should they 
be successful. 
  Tehran also appears to believe that one aim of the talks 
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
is to destabilize Iran, according to the paper. 
  The Islamic groups attending the meeting included Hizballah, 
a Lebanon-based militant Shi'ite faction, and the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, an extremist 
group operating outside the PLO, the report said. 
  The meeting was also attended by high-ranking officials from 
the Iranian intelligence service and Iran's Revolutionary Guard 
Corps, the report said. 
  The paper said Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps has trained 
the Japanese Red Army in al-Biqa' Valley in Lebanon and the 
Iranian Embassy in Beirut has helped Red Army members travel 
between Iran and Lebanon. 
  The Red Army, formed in 1971, was responsible for a series 
of 
hijacking and armed attacks in the 1970s, including the 1972 
massacre at Lod International Airport in Tel Aviv.

<F P=106> [Markus Wallenberg report: "Shritah: `I Was Not the </F>
Embassy Chieftain'"; all Syrian names spelling as published] 
  [Text] The trial of Helmut Voigt, former department head 
of the antiterror group of the GDR Ministry of State Security 
(MfS), [for involvement in the 1983 bomb attack on the French 
Consulate General in West Berlin] is entering the fifth week. 
Against all expectations, Nabil Shritah, third secretary of the 
Syrian Embassy in the German Democratic Republic and resident of 
one of the Syrian intelligence services, has decided to testify 
in court, even though his performance can hardly be called that. 
[see item LD0702161994 in previous Terrorism report for initial 
reporting on Shritah's testimony] Hidden behind two folding 
screens and surrounded by bodyguards, he played out a wonderful 
soap opera: eulogies to his homeland in the Middle East, which 
has had very good relations with the FRG for more than six 
years, as he said. 
  Syria is "combatting terrorism" and there are "certain 
circles" that are again linking Syria with terrorism to disturb 
relations, the "witness" claimed. Who the "certain circles" are 
remained in the dark, or more precisely: darkened. Shritah, who 
stored weapons, passports, and explosives in his embassy room at 
Otto-Grotewohl Street 3 and in his private apartment for the 
Carlos group, described his responsible duties as a diplomat 
very prosaically: He just invited other diplomats for coffee, 
opened the door, and watched for telexes on Sundays and 
holidays. After all, he was not "the Embassy chieftain." 
  Carlos, his wife Magdalena from Ulm, and his assistant 
Johannes Weinrich came to him, because he should buy them some 
goods in the diplomats' commissary. Shritah's comments on the 
matter at hand were of a similar quality, insofar as he made any 
statements at all. When Voigt's lawyers asked about the details 
of Shritah's sudden appearance in the FRG shortly before the 
opening of the main trial, he pleaded his privilege to decline 
to answer questions. Otherwise, he would have had to answer a 
few unpleasant questions, for instance about a Syrian fighter at 
the invisible frontline, called Tawas Taham. 
  Taham, who has lived in West Berlin for many years, is 
considered to be the Syrian intelligence service's liaison with 
the RAF [Red Army Faction]. He organized a lawyer for Shritah 
(his own), when the latter came into conflict with FRG law in 
February 1982. Shritah was in prison in West Berlin for 14 days 
and had to pay a fine of 5,000 German marks [DM]. Meanwhile, 
three versions of the diplomat's crime have emerged: smuggling 
cigarettes (MfS file), tax evasion (Shritah), smuggling arms and 
explosives (report by an unofficial MfS employee). 
<H5>  How Saul Turned Into Paul </H5>
  The latter report contains the interesting piece of 
information that there was a West German-Syrian deal in 
connection with the criminal procedure: the release of three 
Germans in Syria in return for a mild sentence and a cover up of 
the unfriendly act. Tawas Taham once again altruistically cared 
for the imprisoned Shritah. 
  During the first interrogation by the State Protection 
Office 
on 9 January 1994, Shritah urgently asked that his stay in Bonn 
not be revealed to the Syrian Embassy, because he would 
incriminate Syria. Therefore, he also wanted to request 
political asylum in the FRG. The next day Tawas Taham called 
Shritah in Moabit prison, visited him, and provided Nicolas 
Becker as his lawyer. Then Shritah had a telephone conversation 
in Arabic with his wife in Damascus. On 11 January he even 
asked for a visit by a Syrian Embassy employee, who quickly 
appeared on 12 January, and on 13 January Saul had turned into 
Paul. 
  Shritah had his Damascus experience [sentence as published]. 
He said that Syria had had nothing at all to do with the bomb 
attack on the French Consulate General, and he had come 
voluntarily and privately to Budapest and Berlin. The reward 
for the successful coup arrived by return mail: Shritah was 
released from detention pending trial "subject to conditions," 
despite the pending procedure for aiding and abetting murder and 
aiding and abetting a dangerous bomb attack. 
<H5>  Silence of the Grave Surrounds the Late Abul Hakkam </H5>
  Exactly the same accusations are made against Helmut Voigt, 
who has been in prison since 6 September 1992 because of them. 
The unequal treatment goes even further, because, while 
intelligence service man Voigt is presented as an "MfS 
perpetrator," Shritah emerges as an "MfS victim." This became 
clear in connection with Shritah's file at the Gauck office. 
The MfS knew about the men behind the Syrian and about his 
contacts and, therefore, it had a file about him; Shritah was a 
"target for investigation," his "movements" were documented, 
unofficial employees were asked about him, and there was 
intensive monitoring. 
  All this now elevates him, because Mr. Ziem of the Gauck 
Office pointed out that his is a "victim's file" and Shritah 
must give approval so that others can read it. To make it clear 
once again: Nabil Shritah is strongly suspected of having been 
essentially involved in the terrorist attack on the Maison de 
France! 
  However, there is still another figure in the game, who, 
strangely enough, is mentioned only by Voigt and his lawyers: 
Hassan Saleh Ali, who called himself Abul Hakkam. Forty years 
old at the time of the bomb attack, born in Aden (Yemen), 
according to his passport, he turned up in the GDR with a 
diplomatic passport issued by the People's Democratic Republic 
of Yemen, Nr. 002 906. In addition, he also had a Syrian 
diplomatic passport, Nr. 2387/79, for the name Mohamad Bitar, 
which said that he was born in Homs (Syria). He was in fact the 
number two after Carlos in the group, not Johannes Weinrich from 
Brakel, the former pioneer of the Revolutionary Cells in the FRG. 
  Abul Hakkam had influence on the uncontrolled and 
unpredictable Carlos, and constantly traveled between Syria, 
Iraq, Lebanon, Switzerland, the CSSR, Hungary, and the GDR. 
After a meeting between Carlos, Hakkam, and other Syrian 
intelligence agents in Damascus in February 1980, the Carlos 
group got weapons and passports, and the ambassadors in East 
Berlin, Prague, Sofia, and Budapest were ordered to help and 
support the owners of the passports as much as possible. The 
code phrase was: "I come from Abul Hakkam." 
  On 16 August 1983, nine days before the attack, Abul Hakkam 
once again entered the GDR, announced by the Hungarian 
intelligence service. On 20 August, also previously announced, 
a Lebanese, who called himself Achmed Muhamad el-Sibai, arrived 
and, naturally, presented a diplomatic passport at Schoenefeld 
Airport as well as a letter to the Syrian ambassador. On the 
day of the attack both crossed the Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse 
border checkpoint on foot without luggage and returned after the 
attack, one shortly after the other. 
  Who brought the explosives to West Berlin and -- above all 
-- 
what kind of explosives? In the Syrian Embassy there were 
several packages with large amounts of TNT, C4, and plastic 
explosive. And why is there neither an arrest warrant nor a 
request for extradition covering Abul Hakkam? Why does the name 
Hakkam not appear in the "Carlos" biography by Stephan Richard 
Meyer? 
<H5>  No Traces and a Meager Motive </H5>
  Meyer is the son of Dr. Richard Meyer, formerly head of the 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and an 
employee of the Federal Intelligence Office, who was still in 
office at the time of the attack. The book is based on insider 
knowledge and files, including MfS files. Was Abul Hakkam the 
agent of FRG services in the Carlos group? No one will be able 
to ask El-Sibai about his role in the terrorism attack anymore. 
The Berlin court has received a death certificate from Lebanon, 
according to which the man was shot dead in the al-Bi'qa Valley 
in the 1980's because of espionage.... 
  Judges, public prosecutors, the defendant, and his lawyers 
insist on the "Magdalena Kopp" motive for the attack. I cannot 
understand that the highly intelligent Helmut Voigt believes in 
the sentimental story about the attempt to get Carlos's lover, 
who was in prison in France, released by blackmail. Or is his 
restraint some sort of protection for his life and health after 
imprisonment? Why were the Syrians so intensively involved in 
the bomb attack, which had to hit both the French and the 
Germans? To which extent is Rifat al-'Asad, the brother of the 
Syrian president, involved in the surrounding events? 
  Rifat had close contacts with France, he often stayed in 
Berlin, and he was also involved in the French-Syrian talks 
about Magdalena Kopp in the Paris Interior Ministry. Colonel 
Rifat was the head of an independent elite unit (Saraju d-Difah) 
with its own heavy weapons and its own intelligence service -- a 
brutal, unscrupulous man, who is responsible for the bloody 
massacres on the Muslim Brethren in 1980-82. 
  Since Syria suffered from a constant lack of money, because 
it afforded itself a disproportionately inflated military 
sector, Rifat solved the financial problem in his own way: by 
smuggling and with the help of dollars earned through drug 
dealing. With the millions gained from the sale of the famous 
"Golden Lebanese" from the hemp fields in the al-Bi'qa Valley he 
paid his troops and his patrons. 
  Rifat wanted to grab power in Syria, which has been ruled by 
his brother, Air Force General Hafiz al-'Asad, since 1970. The 
al-'Asads are members of the Shi'ite 'Alawi sect, whose members 
were held in contempt as heretics during the 400 years of 
Turkish rule and have always been considered non-Muslims by the 
Sunnites. During the period of the Mandate, the French gave the 
'Alawi, who had been kept away from public life for centuries, 
just like the Druze and the "heterodox" Christians, the right to 
enter the military forces. After Syria became independent on 14 
April 1946, the power-hungry 'Alawi quickly rose to leading 
political and military positions. 
  One must also mention that Syria, with 12 million 
inhabitants, "affords" itself four intelligence services! When 
Hafiz al-'Asad fell sick in 1982-83, the power struggle began. 
Rifat looked for supporters at home and abroad and tried to 
stage a coup when his brother's health deteriorated dramatically 
at the end of 1983. Did he make specific offers to the French, 
which were rejected? Or did General Ali Duba, the head of the 
Syrian military intelligence service and Carlos's friend, want 
to warn France against collaboration with the hated usurper? 
  Together with the chief of general staff, the defense 
minister, and other leading military officers, Duba opposed 
Rifat, which led even to armed conflicts between the rivaling 
troop units. When Hafiz al-'Asad recovered, Rifat was 
temporarily "banned" to Moscow; from there he defected to Paris 
via Geneva. In November 1984 he was permitted to return "home 
to Damascus" and became vice president. 
<H5>  Too Many Questions Without Answers </H5>
  The struggle for power in Syria could be one of the possible 
reasons for the Syrian involvement in the attack on the Maison 
de France. The trial at the 29th Criminal Division of the 
Berlin Court will not be able to clarify the origins and the 
motives of the attack. This is not the fault of the judges' 
honest efforts to clarify the events and to understand the 
structures of intelligence service work. 
  The requests by the joint plaintiff to summon the then 
French 
and Italian embassy councillors in the GDR and ask them who told 
them about the forthcoming attack, remain just so much 
wastepaper. It will also not be possible to ask why the 
Frenchman speaks of two dead, while officially only one death 
was reported. No representatives of the German and French 
intelligence services will appear in front of Judge Hueller and 
Senior Public Prosecutor Mehlis and will have to accept the 
question of why the FRG and France also acted as a transit and 
resting area for the Carlos group. 
  And the fact that neither traces of the explosives nor 
traces 
of smoke were found at the site of the bomb attack, will 
probably lead to speculations not just among those who observe 
the trial, when they think of Nabil Shritah's words: "Relations 
between Syria and the FRG are characterized by mutual respect 
and benefit; there is an exchange at all levels." Syria -- this 
means refuge and care for terrorists, such as Carlos, Weinrich, 
Abu-Nidal, Abu-Dawud, Abu-Iyad, Abu-Musa, Wadi Haddad, George 
Habash...

<F P=106> [Article signed SK/UC/LL: "Non-Extradition Of Two Iranians </F>
By France: Federal Council Refers Matter To French Council Of 
State"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Excerpts] Bern, 16 Feb (ATS) -- The Federal Council 
decided Wednesday to refer to the French Council of State 
following France's refusal to extradite two Iranians. [see pp. 
5-6 of 12 January 1994 Terrorism Report for report of Iranians' 
expulsion] France's highest administrative court will have to 
determine whether France violated the European Convention on 
Extradition. In the eyes of the Swiss government, the 
credibility of the fight against terrorism is at stake, Federal 
Council Member Arnold Koller said. The Council of State 
confirmed Wednesday that this appeal is admissible. [background 
passage omitted] 
<H5>  Respect Its Commitments </H5>
  The Federal Council feels that France has violated the 
European Convention on Extradition of 1957. This instrument is 
based on reciprocity and the obligation to provide a reason for 
any refusal of a request for extradition. Its legal force 
depends on the relations of confidence between the contracting 
countries regarding respect of human rights. The Swiss aim is 
to obtain a court ruling of one state's failure to comply with 
international commitments. 
  A single breach in the system endangers the credibility of 
the fight against terrorism, Arnold Koller stressed. It is for 
this reason of principle that the Federal Council decided to 
bring the matter before a legal authority. 
<H5>  Big Surprise </H5>
  Arnold Koller reiterated that Switzerland was all the more 
surprised by its neighbor's attitude since the French 
authorities announced four times that the extradition would take 
place. The surprise was also reinforced by the fact that in 
1991 and 1992 Switzerland extradited to France two Iranians 
wanted for participating in the assassination of the former 
Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar. 
  The French Council of State has a twofold mission: that of 
the supreme administrative court guaranteeing fundamental rights 
and liberties, and that of adviser to the government in drafting 
laws. Since 1977, it has also been referred to in contested 
extradition cases. [passage omitted on French comments] 
<H5>  The Inquiry Continues </H5>
  Switzerland's action vis-a-vis the Council of State 
"overjoyed" Roland Chatelain, the examining magistrate for the 
canton of Vaud. He has not closed the file and is continuing his 
investigation into the responsibility of the Iranians -- 13 in 
all -- who are suspected in the assassination of Kazem Radjavi. 
Ernst Muehlemann, chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of 
the Swiss National Council, also welcomed the Federal Council's 
decision.

  [Text] An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 hijacked yesterday 
by two Ethiopians while on domestic flight from Bahir Dar to 
Addis Ababa and forced to land in Djibouti, returned to Addis 
Ababa yesterday evening, Ethiopian Airlines reported today. The 
airline noted that the hijacked aircraft with 115 passengers and 
eight crew members on board was forced to fly to Djibouti 
because the hijackers ordered the pilot to refuel the plane in 
Djibouti before proceeding to San'a. However, the Djibouti 
authorities refused to refuel the aircraft. After lengthy 
negotiations, the aircraft and its passengers returned yesterday 
at 2230 and the hijackers remained in Djibouti. The airline 
gave no details of how the aircraft was hijacked or the fate of 
the hijackers. [see item AB1002180694 in previous Terrorism

  [Text] Two Italian aid workers whose names are still not 
known were kidnapped this morning in an area northwest of Giohar 
[place name as received] in Somalia. Contacts with Somali 
delegations are already under way in an effort to secure the 
release of the two hostages, and Mario Scialoia, the Italian 
ambassador in Mogadishu, has taken steps to solve the problem. 
  Meanwhile, in a meeting with Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary 
Carmelo Azzara, interim Somali President Ali Mahdi has asked for 
the Italian contingent to remain in Somalia, or at the very 
least for it to be "the last to leave the country."
