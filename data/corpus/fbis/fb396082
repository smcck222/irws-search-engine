  [Text] Terrorist Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, alias 
Feliciano, who is considered to be the new Shining Path chief, 
limps on his right leg and is totally bald. Police intelligence 
sources believe he uses a toupee or wig. 
  The intelligence services indicate that Feliciano, the son 
of 
a well known retired Army general, is the most influential 
leader in the collective national Shining Path leadership, the 
main unit of that organization since the capture of its founder 
Abimael Guzman Reinoso. 
  Various departments of the National Intelligence System 
(SIN) 
have been unable until now to obtain any new information on the 
whereabouts and the physical appearance of the terrorist. 
  Latest reports suggest he is in the southern part of the 
country, but this is unconfirmed. There is also evidence that 
his hideout is in metropolitan Lima. 
  The PNP [National Peruvian Police] and the SIN only have two 
photographs of Feliciano: One is 12 years old, and the other 
dates back to 1988. This second photograph was taken from a 
video tape confiscated at the house in San Borja where it is 
believed Guzman took refuge. 
  The photograph is blurred and his physical aspects are not 
shown clearly. Ramirez uses glasses in both photographs. He is 
bespectacled and is in a stage of advanced baldness. 
  The only new aspect to now is information regarding the limp 
and the toupee, according to details obtained from Shining Path 
members captured during the past few months. 
  No one close to Ramirez has been captured yet who could help 
draw an Indentikit picture of his physical appearance. 
  It is not exactly known how he obtained the limp, but it is 
known that it was acquired some years ago. 
  One police officer commented that it is possible he is now 
completely bald and that he uses a toupee. "It is not 
inconceivable for him to be walking about Lima with a false 
identity and new physical features," the source added. 
  Analysts suggest Feliciano leads the hard line -- Pol Pot 
style -- sector of the terrorist group because his position is 
opposite to that of Guzman and of the main "historical leaders" 
of Shining Path. The hard line sector has been attributed with 
the most recent attacks.

  [Text] Lima, 18 Mar (EFE) -- The Peruvian Government has 
extended the state of emergency in Lima and its port of El 
Callao for another 60 days because "continued terrorist actions 
force this measure." 
  Lima and El Callao houses more than one third of Peru's 
total 
population of 22 million inhabitants. 
  The measure suspends personal guarantees contained in the 
Constitution and delegates political and military control to the 
Armed Forces. 
  The measure was published today in the official newspaper EL 
PERUANO. The newspaper also publishes another measure that 
extends the state of emergency for 60 days in the provinces of 
Yungay, Carhuaz, and Recuay in the northern Andes department of 
Ancash. 
  On 16 March, the Defense Ministry extended for 60 days the 
state of emergency in four jungle provinces in the northern part 
of the country.

  [Text] The Hague, 21 Mar (EFE) -- The Dutch news agency ANP 
in Paramaribo has reported that members of a guerrilla group 
seized the hydroelectric plant in Afobaka hours ago and they are 
currently holding 30 hostages. 
  According to an unidentified spokesman of the group called 
the "Liberation Front of Suriname," access roads to the 
hydroelectric plant have been mined in a 7-km radius. The 
hydroelectric dam supplies energy to the country's capital, 
located 100 km to the north. 
  According to ANP, the guerrilla group is holding 30 
employees 
of Suralco, a bauxite company, hostage and they are demanding a 
"decentralization of power" and the resignation of the 
Surinamese Government.

  [Text] The Hague, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Surinamese President 
Ronald Venetiaan expressed his willingness to hold a dialogue 
with the rebels who seized a hydroelectric dam and are holding 
30 workers hostage, the Dutch agency ANP reported from 
Paramaribo today. 
  On 21 March, 100 guerrillas of the self-styled Liberation 
Front of Suriname seized the Afobaka Dam, located 100 km south 
of Paramaribo, and mined its main access roads. 
  The rebel group is holding 30 workers of the Suralco mining 
company hostage and threatening to blow up the dam at 1400 today 
Dutch time (1300 GMT), leaving Paramaribo without electricity, 
if the government does not resign. 
  In addition to President Venetiaan's resignation, the Front 
demands a broad program to improve "the critical economic 
situation" as well as health and education services for the 
population. 
  The group is also asking for the withdrawal of a Canadian 
company that extracts gold in various concessions in the 
interior of the country and that the mining rights be granted to 
Surinamers. 
  In an appeal to the population, Venetiaan asked for a 
dialogue with the rebels to reach a peaceful solution to the 
conflict, ANP revealed from the former Dutch colony in northern 
South America. 
  The president added, however, that violence does not solve 
anything and that "terrorism will never force me to resign."

  [Text] Military personnel from Hizballah and the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard are running a military training program for 
Sudanese, Tunisian, Algerian, Egyptian, and even Afghan Islamic 
fundamentalists in Lebanon's al-Biqa' region. 
  Reports say the Iranian city of Darja last October witnessed 
meetings between Naser al-Din, an official from the pro-Tehran 
Shiite Afghan Wihdah Party, and Me'iri, an Iranian major 
general. The two sides agreed that the Afghan Wihdah Party would 
send several of its members to receive military and security 
training at the Hizballah camps. It has been learned the 
cooperation is designed to acclimatize Afghans to fight on 
terrain different from their own and to tighten friendship and 
cooperation between Afghan and other extreme fundamentalists. 
  This is in addition to other security and political 
considerations. The aim is to bring together various 
fundamentalist groups in Lebanon that Iran can keep as reserves 
for possible future actions in the region. The Afghans are 
deployed in a number of Hizballah centers in al-Biqa', Beirut, 
and Ba'labakk. They are receiving training at premises of 
Ja'farite scientific seminaries supervised by an Iranian. At 
the Hizballah camps in Hanta, the Afghans are being trained in 
the use of anti-tank TOW rockets alongside Sudanese, Tunisians, 
and Algerians. At the Hizballah base for naval training on the 
banks of the al-'Aji River in al-Hirmil, Afghans are being 
instructed in diving skills and naval mines detonation by 
Bahrasi, an Iranian expert. 
  According to security sources, Afghans are receiving 
training 
in Beirut's southern suburbs.

<F P=106> [Rafiq al-Zayn report from Beirut] </F>
  [Text] In less than one month, Lebanese security 
authorities in coordination with Jordanian authorities have 
succeeded in unraveling the mystery of the assassination of 
Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al- Ma'ayitah in Beirut on 29 January. 
It seems that the Abu-Nidal group is not the only party 
responsible for the operation. The file AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has 
obtained on the investigation confirms close cooperation and 
coordination between Fatah-the Revolutionary Council [FRC] and 
Jordanian fundamentalist extremist groups sponsored by Iran. In 
this investigative report AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI reveals the details 
of this network, the secret meetings it held in Tehran, 
Amsterdam, and Beirut, the names of those who planned and 
carried out the assassination, the centers where they were 
trained, their affiliations, and how this leads to exposing 
dangerous secrets which made the Abu-Nidal group send threat 
letters to those in charge of the investigation. 
  A few days ago, Palestinian Ahmad Mahmud 'Abd-al-Karim, a 
prominent FRC official, arrived in Lebanon from Finland on the 
special mission of following up the investigations the Lebanese 
authorities are conducting with the Palestinians from the 
Abu-Nidal group who are accused of the assassination of 
Jordanian First Secretary Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut on 29 
January. 
  Reports confirm that shortly after arriving in Beirut, Ahmad 
'Abd-al-Karim left for the FRC's al-Rawdah camps in Western 
al-Biqa' from where he followed the investigation through 
reports sent to him by people who secretly work for the FRC and 
who provided him with information in exchange for generous sums 
of money. Reports say that some officials in the Lebanese 
security organs have links with the Abu-Nidal group. 
  At the same time, AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that the 
Abu- Nidal group recently sent threat letters to Lebanese 
officials who are currently investigating its members who are 
involved in the al- Ma'ayitah assassination. These are: Yusuf 
Sha'ban, Bassam Muhammad 'Attiyah, and Yusuf 'Udwani, codenamed 
Salim Mahyub. Lebanese investigator, Judge Sa'id Mirza ordered 
the arrest of the three Palestinians and listened to the 
deposition of three witnesses, including 'Afaf Yusuf [not 
further identified] who reiterated her previous deposition. 
Reports mention that the first steps in the investigation have 
revealed that the FRC planned and carried out the assassination 
in coordination with the Jordanian fundamentalist Islamic 
Mobilization Youth Organization [IMYO] which is financed by Iran. 
  The IMYO was exposed in Jordan by Jordanian authorities on 
17 
August 1992 when the Jordanian security bodies confiscated 
weapons and ammunition the organization had been hiding in 
Jordan to be used to destablize the regime and security in the 
country. During the trials, this organization tried to claim 
that the weapons found by the authorities were temporarily 
hidden in Jordan but were to be smuggled into the occupied 
territories and given to the Palestinian strugglers there to 
enhance their ability to confront the Zionist forces and carry 
out military operations against them. The IMYO also claimed 
that the weapons that were found were not brought in from any 
neighboring country but were purchased on the local market. At 
the time, two members of Parliament were arrested; Ya'qub 
Qirrish anbd Layth Shubaylat on chrages of heading the 
organization. 
  The security information the investigators have collected on 
the al-Ma'ayitah assassination shows that as soon as the IMYO 
was exposed, Jordanian fundamentalist elements belonging to 
various organizations such as Muhammad's Army, the Islamic 
Liberation Army, and the IMYO and others moved to neighboring 
Arab countries. Most of the factions left for Lebanon where 
they found the suitable atmosphere and the appropriate place to 
carry out their activities in cooperation with Hizballah. The 
information gathered also shows that some Jordanian 
fundamentalist elements moved to Iran where they received 
training courses in the Al-Quds camp and the Kermandi [name as 
transliterated] camp, and courses in intelligence work in the 
Darjah [name as transliterated] institute. Iran has sponsored 
these organizations to establish Islamic organizations and cells 
in the countries that have common borders with Israel so they 
can take power in these countries and turn them into Islamic 
regimes. 
  Since that time, Iran exploited the elements from these 
fundamentalist organizations and established the Jordan office 
in the Liberation Movement's office. Ayatollah Shakhiry [name 
as transliterated], the official in charge of the Jordan section 
in the Iranian intelligence organ, took charge of this office. 
  Confirmed information indicates that in early 1994, IMYO 
elements held an important meeting in Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands, with officials from the FRC. The official in 
charge of the Jordanian elements was Shakir Abu-Jami', a 
Jordanian national wanted by authorities in his country and one 
of the most prominent members of the Jordanian fundamentalist 
Muhammad Army Organization. Abu-Jami' now lives in Sa'dah, 
Yemen, which is home to camps for Afghan and Arab 
fundamentalists. 
  The information adds that the IMYO made several decisions to 
attack Jordanian interests and institutions and assassinate 
Jordanian diplomats in a move to pressure the Jordanian regime. 
The information says that the scheme was designed some two 
years ago and the Muslim Brotherhood Movement in Jordan refused 
to get involved in it because of the danger and because the 
Brotherhood Movement does not agree with the proposals of other 
fundamentalist organizations. 
  Iran managed to recruit FRC members to work in the Jordanian 
fundamentalist extremist organizations by taking advantage of 
the hostility the Abu-Nidal group has harbored against Jordan 
and its regime and king ever since the group was expelled from 
the country. The information confirms that Abu-Nidal group's 
leadership agreed to execute the mission for the aforesaid 
reasons, because of its commitment to the policy of extremism 
and rejection that aims at torpedoing the [peace] process, and 
because of its ties to Iran within the framework of 
international terrorism. 
  Detailing this cooperation that lead to al-Ma'ayitah's 
assassination, the security sources note that the al-Ramlah al- 
Bayda' area in Beirut contained a secret headquarters for Walid 
Khalid, the FRC official spokesman who was assassinated in the 
Lebanese capital on 30 July 1992. These meetings were conducted 
in the presence of an FRC official called Amjad 'Ata, a Lebanese 
member of Abu-Nidal group named Tha'ir, and a Jordanian IMYO 
official from the Idkaydik family. The plan to assassinate 
al-Ma'ayitah was drafted during these meetings. 
  But why did the Abu-Nidal group and the IMYO choose to 
assassinate Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah and not any other Jordanian 
official in the Beirut embassy. 
  To carry out the assassination, an intensive training course 
was conducted for the Palestinians Bassam 'Atiyah and Yusuf 
'Adwani in a secret center run by Abu-Nidal group in Buq'atah in 
Lebanon's al- Shuf area under the supervision of a Palestinian 
expert in assassinations called A. al-'Umayri [not further 
identified]. Al- 'Umayri was implicated in the assassination of 
the FRC official Bahij Abu-al-Hana in July 1992 in Lebanon's 
al-Biqa' area, after he accused him of contacting the 
'Arafat-led Fatah movement. 
  Confirmed security information says a Jordanian 
fundamentalist took part in the assassination of al-Ma'ayitah. 
He was charged with observation and backup when the 
assassination was carried out. The man is called Khalid 
al-Bishtawi, 34 years old. The security agencies' information 
suggests that al-Bishtawi fled to Burj al- Barajinah camp after 
the crime and then moved to Cyprus where he joined Jordanian 
fundamentalist elements living there with Tunisian 
fundamentalists from the Rachid Ghanouchi-led al-Nahdah Movement. 
  The FRC (Abu-Nidal group) took immediate steps after al- 
Ma'ayitah's assassination. It made changes within the ranks of 
its officials and moved some of them outside Lebanon and changed 
the secret apartments it owns in Beirut and the southern part of 
Sidon. 
  It is worth noting that the Jordanian intelligence service 
played an important role in revealing the secrets and details of 
al- Ma'ayitah's assassination. Jordanian security officials 
traveled to Lebanon and cooperated with Lebanese officers in the 
investigations that led to revealing all the details and the 
arrest of more than 30 members of Abu-Nidal group in Jordan. It 
seems that the investigations will not stop at this point in 
Beirut or Amman. 
  In an apparent attempt to prevent the revelation of further 
details, the leadership of the Abu-Nidal group urged King Husayn 
to "give it a chance to explain its position." It also 
hastened to send one of its officials to Lebanon to follow the 
investigation and try to lessen its repercussions out of fear 
that al-Ma'ayitah's assassination may be one of the fatal 
mistakes committed by the FRC and may negatively affect the 
organization's future in Lebanon and Jordan.

<F P=106> [Article by Nadav Ha'etzni: "The Palestinian Street -- </F>
Drifting Away From 'Arafat] 
  [Text] Leaflets calling for the resumption of the armed 
and violent struggle against Israel and for quitting the talks 
with it have been distributed throughout the territories in the 
last two weeks, since the massacre in Hebron. Some of the 
leaflets demanded the Palestinian leadership not return to the 
negotiating table unless settlements are eradicated and an 
international force is deployed in the territories. 
  There was nothing dramatically new in the content of the 
leaflets. They stated the position of the Palestinian 
opposition, which has been operating openly since the Oslo 
agreement was disclosed. However, there was a big change in the 
identity of the signatories. The name of 'Arafat's 
organization, Fatah, appeared in all of them, alongside that of 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the Democratic and the 
Popular Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine, and other 
opponents of the process. One such leaflet, signed by seven 
organizations, was distributed in Jericho; others appeared in 
places such as Hebron and Janin. 
  What is interesting is that the leaflets did not appear out 
of the blue. They are the external manifestation of a profound 
process which has been gathering momentum since the Hebron 
massacre. A broad coalition has been emerging in the street and 
in internal circles, which has been pushing for a total halt of 
the talks. 'Arafat's closest advisers have been bending over 
backwards in a bid to find a way back to the negotiations, but 
as the situation appears now, no acrobatic formula will satisfy 
the local leadership in the territories. In fact, most Fatah 
activists in the cities have fallen into step with their 
erstwhile opponents. Many Fatah members in Hebron went as far 
as announcing their desertion to the ranks of Hamas. 
  According to various reports, this "closing of ranks" around 
the opposition has had another effect: the resumption of 
terrorist activities against Israel. Israeli security elements 
are aware of the fact that instructions in that spirit have been 
sent from Tunis and Amman to Fatah gangs in Judaea, Samaria, and 
Gaza. However, even if such instructions had not been received 
from the outside, the disengagement from Oslo would have been 
inevitable. Many of these militant leaflets were written 
without the approval of the chairman in Tunis or his envoy in 
Jerusalem, Faysal al-Husayni. The latter tried to thwart 
attempts to bring about cooperation between the opposition and 
Fatah on the national level, but these efforts spurred 
al-Husayni's subordinates to take independent action. [passage

  [Text] The Spanish Government advises all Spaniards 
residing in Algeria whose presence there is not essential to 
leave the country. The on-going attacks of foreigners by Islamic 
groups are the reason for this warning. The Spanish colony in 
Algeria numbers 327. The advice also covers diplomatic 
personnel whose protection has been increased over the last 
months. 
  The French authorities have also made a similar appeal to 
their community in Algeria. Yesterday's stabbing of a French 
businessman and his son in Algiers means that 31 foreigners have 
been murdered in Algeria over the last six months.

[passage omitted] 
  The Algerian "Armed Islamic Group" [GIA] has claimed 
responsibility for the two Frenchmen's murder in the Birkhadem 
area near the capital, Algiers, the day before yesterday. A 
statement issued by the group, copies of which AL-HAYAH has 
received in Peshawar by fax from abroad, says: "The Armed 
Islamic Group in Algeria claims responsibility for the murder of 
two French crusaders [salibiyyayn]." The statement adds: "This 
operation falls within the program drawn up by the group to 
eliminate any presence of Jews and Christians in the land of 
Islam in Algeria." In its statement the group said that the 
presence of the Jews, Christians, and polytheists in the land of 
Islam is a direct support for an infidel and illegitimate 
government which should be eliminated by the blade of the sword.

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Mar (MENA) -- A responsible security 
source at the Ministry of Interior today said that security men 
had uncovered an "arsenal" containing large quantities of 
explosives and bombs inside a den belonging to a terrorist in 
the 'Ayn Shams Buildings' area [in Cairo]. The terrorist is 
wanted for involvement in recent terrorist crimes, particularly 
attacks against banks in greater Cairo. 
  The source pointed out that when the den was stormed, the 
terrorist was not found there, but sketches indicating the 
locations of some important installations, banks, and targeted 
individuals in Cairo and al-Jizah were found, in preparation for 
carrying out a plan. 
  The same source added that the State Security Intelligence 
Department had received information that terrorist Mustafa 
Muhammad Ibrahim Siddiq, better known as Zaghlul, was taking 
refuge at a hideout in the 'Ayn Shams Buildings. Investigations 
revealed he was involved in the recent bank bombings. Inside 
the hideout, security men found parts of RPG launchers, two 
homemade guns, a quantity of highly explosive TNT, and a roll of 
fuse used in bombings. A camera, a number of cans used for 
making explosive devices, and some "organizational" documents 
containing the names of some important figures and targeted 
senior police officials were also found in the den.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hasan al-Hillawi by Khalid Salah in Turah </F>
Prison in Cairo; date not given -- the interview is preceded by 
the introductory passage in the first paragraph] 
  [Text] Al-Hillawi is one of the founders of the so-called 
Islamic Jihad Movement. He joined the Nabil Bura'i-led 
organization in 1967. Ayman al-Zawahiri was also one of the 
group's cadres. Al-Hillawi was the fourth defendant in the case 
known as the Technical Military Academy case in 1974 but he was 
acquitted. He then participated in establishing an organization 
that attacked a foreign consulate in Alexandria in 1977. 
Al-Hillawi was sentenced to seven years. But he escaped and 
spent 16 years abroad. It was reported then that he was one of 
the major financiers of terrorist operations in Egypt. He was 
arrested by the Saudi intelligence service in May and is now a 
guest of the Turah Prison. We met him there. He said he had 
renounced terrorism. He declared his new ideas renouncing 
terrorism and refuting the ideas of those who kill innocent men, 
women, and children. 
  Salah: What are the motives behind your statements 
condemning terrorism and lashing out at the group of which you 
were a principal founder? 
  Al-Hillawi: My main motive was that I wanted to 
defend the true image of Islam. The current actions of these 
groups, which they attribute to Islam, distort the image of 
Islam and the Muslims. It is one of my religious dutiesm -- I am 
a graduate of the al-Azhar University -- to tell the truth and 
show that these actions are not linked with the pure religion, 
Islam. 
  These groups, which carry out acts of violence, should not 
be 
attributed to Islam. True, we called on people in the past to 
abide by and defend religion but we never asked them to form 
organizations or jihad. At first, we called for jihad in 
defense of Egypt, not to spread corruption in it. Religion 
demands that we carry out jihad to promote the country and 
defend sanctities. Jihad is not sowing discords or shedding 
blood unjustly. That is sedition. How could I kill Muslims or 
even non-Muslims who are defenseless and who are not our 
enemies? How could I kill them and still call it jihad? That 
is a crime. 
  Salah: Is it not strange for you to say this when 
you were one of the founders of this movement and the principal 
financier when you were abroad? 
  Al-Hillawi: I took part in founding the movement 
that called for real jihad, not for shedding blood falsely. How 
could we approach the people now with their hearts imbued with 
indignation after satan sowed sedition and used some groups 
affiliated with Islam? How could we face the people now that 
every bearded person and every veiled person reflects the image 
of a treacherous killer? As for the talk about me financing 
these groups, this is wrong. It has never taken place. 
  Salah: But what made you stay quiet all these 
years? What made you declare these new ideas after your arrest? 
Were you subjected to specific pressures, for example? 
  Al-Hillawi: I was not silent. But travel enabled 
me to survey the situation carefully. I wrote a book in which I 
refuted their ideas. I recorded this opinion and several 
sermons made in Saudi Arabia on tape. I swear that my writings 
and announcements were not shaped under pressure. I also swear 
that I offered nothing in return for my release from prison. 
All my ideas have been prompted by what I have seen of ugly 
actions, which they attribute to Islam falsely. I know they say 
I have become weak and sick. But this is not true. It is only 
the horror that is inflicted on every preacher and ourselves by 
the shedding of the blood of Muslims or non-Muslims. God 
forbids such actions. 
  Salah: In your view, what has led these groups to 
all this violence and terrorism? 
  Al-Hillawi: They have never consulted the ulema 
but followed their own deficient interpretations until they 
reached the current state of confusion. Had they gone back to 
the scholars and those who issue religious decrees in Egypt, 
they would not have reached this state. 
  They sought their own interpretations although they are not 
qualified to do so and cited legal religious texts in the wrong 
situations. For example, they kill innocent people with their 
explosions and assassinations and then say they did not mean to 
kill them. If we ask them what these people did to be killed, 
they would reply that they were killed by mistake and that the 
killers will be made to answer and judged [by God] according to 
their intentions. Take the verse: "If any do fail to judge by 
(the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (no better than) 
wrongdoers" [Koranic verse]. This is the verse on which they 
establish most of their ideas and deeds. They became so general 
in their interpretation that they thought simply that they are 
the Muslims and the rest are infidels. This is wrong because 
the correct interpretation of the verse is that any one who does 
not accept God's rule, thinks there is a better rule, and says 
so is an infidel. But even the rulers of Egypt and Arab and 
Islamic countries do not say this. Everyone, including the 
rulers, knows that Islamic shari'ah is the greatest and most 
revered thing. They always declare this but believe that there 
are circumstances that impede its implementation to the full. 
Such circumstances may be acceptable to some and not to others 
and this is something that should be interpreted, because it is 
a contentious issue and no judgment can be passed on it in this 
unjust manner. 
  Salah: They do not only level charges against the 
rulers but also describe the entire state as ignorant. 
  Al-Hillawi: This is an erroneous statement because 
Imam al- Shafi'i [late Muslim scholar] said every country 
conquered by Muslims will remain an Islamic state until 
doomsday. How can this be said today? All the Arab countries 
are Islamic and the people in them are Muslims and non-Muslims, 
as is the case in every society where there is good and bad. 
Even these societies include the reformer and the corrupt and 
the believer and the hypocrite. Everyone is judged by his deeds. 
Egyptian society in particular is an Islamic one and no one can 
say it is not. 
  Salah: Do you have an alternative to the call for 
change under these circumstances? 
  Al-Hillawi: I have no Islamic line except to 
follow the ulema and listen to them. Talk of senior ulema must 
be heeded. As for gathering around youths who have imperfect 
culture and think they truly understand religion, any act they 
commit is imperfect and closer to ignorance. All Muslims must 
follow the renowned ulema who are known for their knowledge and 
piety. 
  Salah: Do you think the groups that practice 
violence in Egypt are financed by foreign states? 
  Al-Hillawi: God knows. Some quarters may want to 
harm popular activity in Egypt. I wonder from where those 
groups brought the money and weapons. Undoubtedly, some 
individuals or groups have an interest in spoiling our affairs. 
I believe there are many sources of finance but I have no 
details. 
  Salah: Are there people in the movement who have 
begun to accept the ideas and joined your call? 
  Al-Hillawi: Yes, thank God. There are hundreds, 
including 'Abd-al-Nasir Durrah, who was one of the suspects in 
al-Jihad incidents in 1981 and who was sentenced to five years 
in prison. The number is increasing daily. Hundreds of members 
abroad are convinced. But there is a need to spread the call 
and expand the new understanding. Those people felt they were 
breaking free of wrong concepts and realizing that right is 
different from what they thought. Many young men who 
effectively understood the truth have begun to explain things to 
others and to call them to the right path. If we are given a 
better chance, these groups' problems will be solved, God 
willing. 
  Salah: What is your comment on recent political 
assassinations and attacks against tourism committed upon orders 
from leaders abroad? 
  Al-Hillawi: Like the Islamic ulema, I see in them 
a kind of corruption on earth; they are religiously 
unacceptable. Not one religious scholar condones this 
corruption. It is against the shari'ah and a product of inept, 
misleading minds. I think those movements were good at first. 
But I ask them now: Are you emulating any model from our 
virtuous early Muslims? I challenge them to say yes. 
  Salah: You said the ulema have a role to play in 
expanding the understanding of religion but those groups do not 
recognize the ulema; they refuse to listen to them and they 
describe them as government ulema. 
  Al-Hillawi: Their talk of government ulema is 
wrong and misleading. Egypt is full of honest and virtuous 
ulema. If they do not listen to the advice of the ulema, they 
will continue to listen to the ignorant and their sedition will 
continue. Of course, there is a problem here, because they view 
themselves as mujahidin, and their dead as martyrs. They 
consider their displacement a kind of a patience along the road 
of jihad. This is a real problem. It is our duty to be patient 
with them and to lead them to the right path. 
  Salah: How? 
  Al-Hillawi: What is happening in Egypt is a kind 
of sedition among Muslims; there must be a conciliation and a 
truce. There must be room for dialogue and the ulema must have 
the chance to explain what is right and to calmly let those 
people know that they are far removed from God's shari'ah. If 
they still reject this explanation, this understanding, and this 
willingness for reform, then they must be confronted with all 
the methods they deserve! We discuss the issue from a religious 
point of view; we discuss religious texts and how they should be 
understood. If they answer in a political or an argumentative 
manner, then their arguments are unacceptable. I knew that some 
of them, such as Ayman al-Zawahiri, wanted to respond to my 
statements. Al-Zawahiri is a man of medicine, a surgeon who is 
not specialized in religious texts; let him talk about medicine, 
not religion. If he mixes medical surgery with religious texts, 
the bleeding will be endless. I tell al-Zawahiri: Fear God. 
Enough corruption on earth. 
  Salah: Aren't you afraid of an attempted 
assassination in the context of their desire to continue the 
violence under the slogan of "preserving the propagation?" 
  Al-Hillawi: They know I say this out of love and 
concern for them. There is no hatred between us and I explain 
to them what is right and that what they are doing has benefited 
no one except the enemies of Islam and Egypt both inside the 
country and abroad. 
  By the way, I was subject to an assassination attempt at the 
hands of Shukri Mustafa, the founder of the Repudiation and 
Renunciation Group, inside jail 18 years ago. God saved me. I 
believe the devil might applaud them for this act but it will 
only bring them evil in this world and punishment in the next. 
I am not afraid of saying what is right. Almighty God says: 
"Ye who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to 
God, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin" 
[Koranic verse] 
  Salah: Do you think the Kaliphate system applies 
now? 
  Al-Hillawi: This is one of the shari'ah's duties 
and the way to this is as the ulema define. But the Muslim 
ulema did not speak about this clearly and we follow them. It 
is a duty, if possible, like pilgrimage. If it is not possible, 
God does not demand that anyone do what is beyond his capability. 
  Numerous groups advocated the reinstatement of the Kaliphate 
system and the call was right. But who gave them the mandate to 
set up such groups for this purpose? This is a violation of the 
rights of all Muslims and such a mandate cannot be used without 
consulting the authoritative people. Establishing groups to 
achieve this goal is impermissible, even the Muslim Shaykh 
Ibn-Taymiyah [former prominent Islamic scholar] did not call for 
setting up such groups. How do you compare such groups with the 
organizations of Ibn- Taymiyah, Imam al-Shafi'i, and Ahmad 
Bin-Hanbal [former Islamic scholars]? I reiterate to them: 
"Show me just one similarity with the deeds of the good 
ancestors." Where are the organizations of the prophet's 
companions, imams, and ancestors? These are ideas they grasped 
as they emulated other world organizations, while Islam does not 
advocate this at all. 
  Salah: Do you intend to continue advocating these 
ideas after you leave prison? 
  Al-Hillawi: I intend to continue until the young 
men know their rights and duties. I will flatter no one in this 
regard -- be they senior officials, rash youths, or any others. 
Returning to what is right is better than pursuing ignorance 
and confusion and I implore God to guide these people to 
righteousness. 
  Salah: Do you believe they still have the strength 
to continue? 
  Al-Hillawi: I believe many of them will soon 
realize what is right and anyone who remains outside this 
genuine understanding will have no value or effect. 
  Salah: How do your inmates who are members of 
these groups treat you in prison? 
  Al-Hillawi: Thanks be to God, all those I have 
spoken to were convinced by the talk. I asked some factions to 
introduce their ulema and cadres so that they might be 
confronted but they were afraid of such confrontation and 
rejected debate and discussion. 
  Salah: Do these factions include anyone you 
believe to be more right and closer to understanding? 
  Al-Hillawi: These factions are many and all their 
differences and disputes resemble pre-Islamic contentions. They 
are personal and tribal. The best one is the one who decides to 
heed only the words of the ulema.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry yesterday started to reinforce 
the al-Qalyubiyah security agencies with "commandos" and threw 
tightened security cordons around the area of al-Khankah. 
  Strict security measures were taken around the homes of 
three 
extremists sentenced in connection with the attempt to kill 
Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. The convicts are Salah Sulayman 
and Tariq Hasan al-Fahl, sentenced to death, and Muhammad 
Khalil, sentenced to life with hard labor. 
  The security agencies stepped up search campaigns in the 
underground terminals and on roads in the area of al-Marj to 
prevent weapons and explosives from reaching the families of the 
three convicts through extremist group members.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Mar (MENA) -- State security investigation 
authorities captured two fugitive terrorists in the Musturud 
area in al-Qalyubiyah Governorate. 
  A security source at the Interior Ministry said one of the 
terrorists is Muhammad Mustafa al-Ghawdiri, a former student at 
the technical commercial institute in Port Said. He was 
sentenced to two years imprisonment in a supreme state security 
criminal case involving an attack on the home of Lieutenant 
Colonel Mutawi' Abu- al-Naja, an officer in the Damietta state 
security branch, and an attempt to assassinate him. He is also 
accused in a supreme state security case involving the planning 
of hostile actions. 
  The security source added that the second terrorist is Ahmad 
Hamadah Mustafa Mursi al-Sayyid, 19, who studied at the al- 
'Abbasiyah School of Art. He was a member of the group that 
carried out recent bank explosions. 
  The source said an automatic weapon magazine, two Baretta 
8.5-mm pistols, a radio set, and forged official cards and 
documents were discovered during the raid, along with some 
organizational papers and a four-volume telephone directory for 
use in locating targeted figures. 
  The security source said the first terrorist was 
superficially wounded by a shot fired at him when he tried to 
escape. His leg was fractured when he jumped down from his 
hideout. The source added that the prosecution has been 
informed so that it can launch an investigation.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Mar (MENA) -- A responsible security 
source at the Ministry of Interior has stated that the six 
terrorists killed in a shack in the Abu Tij area today took part 
in the shooting against a tourist train in Abu Tij, as well as 
the assassination of the chief of the Baqur police station. 
  The security source noted that acting on information that 
these elements were taking shelter in a shack located between 
(al- Balayzah) cemetery and the western mountain of Asyut, 
security troops from the Asyut Security Directorate, State 
Security Intelligence, and antiterrorist squads stormed their 
hideout. The troops came under heavy fire from these elements 
and returned fire. Private Ahmad Mabruk of the Central Security 
Forces was martyred and six terrorists were killed as a result. 
  The source pointed out that four automatic rifles were found 
inside the shack. The terrorists used them to fire at the 
troops. Two of the rifles had been stolen from Sergeant 'Antar 
Madani and conscript Hamad Mahmud Fath-al-Bab from the Baqur 
police station, after they were assassinated. A locally made 
gun, a large quantity of 6.62 and 9.39-mm bullets, a sack full 
of gunpowder and explosives, and a large quantity of 
organization documents were found. 
  The source stressed that police forces are intensifying 
their 
efforts to pursue and arrest the terrorist elements.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Mar (MENA) -- A military judicial source 
stated that army conscript Midhat 'Abd-al-'Al Bayyumi and 
civilian Muhammad Ahmad Muhammad Sa'id were executed today. The 
Higher Military Court had unanimously sentenced them, together 
with a third fugitive defendant named Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi, to 
death in case no. 94/2 of the Military Prosecution Office. 
  The source said that the military prosecution accused the 
two 
civilians, who belonged to the al-Jihad Organization, of seizing 
the opportunity to recruit the conscript in the Armed Forces and 
agreed to provide him with some explosives to use for 
sabotaging one of the military installations in his unit. 
  The source added that the two civilians did in fact bring 
the 
explosives to the conscript but the latter was arrested and the 
explosives seized before the operation was carried out. One of 
his partners was also arrested while the third remains a 
fugitive. 
  The source noted that the court sentenced the three to death 
after being defended by four lawyers. He said that the 
sentences were ratified and then the defendants appealed the 
sentences. The appeals were turned down and legally rejected 
and, therefore, the sentences became final and due for 
implementation. 
  It is recalled that some foreign radios and news agencies 
had 
given an inaccurate report on this issue.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Ali] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A team from the Islamic Group 
attacked a tourist boat on the morning of 'Id al-Fitr [13 March] 
near the Island of Mijris, Markaz Sidfa, directly opposite 
al-Badari Island. The same boat came under another attack half 
an hour later near Asyut. The boat's guards exchanged fire with 
the terrorists, who fled in the direction of al-Badari Island. 
  On the same day, the Islamic Group issued a statement 
justifying its operations by saying that they were in 
retaliation for the massacres of Bosnia's Muslims. 
  The group distributed the statement in Asyut and al-Minya 
immediately after the 'Id al-Fitr prayers. It threatened to 
continue the jihad despite the military trials and arrests. 
  Appealing to Muslim religious scholars, the group said in 
its 
statement: To our ulemas who are feigning sorrow over national 
unity with the Orthodox Christians in Egypt and traveling across 
the country to attack the Muslim youths and excuse the regime's 
mistakes, we say that the international news agencies have 
feigned sorrow over the 200,000 Muslims butchered by Orthodox 
Serbs, the more than 50,000 Muslim women and girls publicly 
raped, and the thousands of children buried alive, slaughtered, 
or placed in cement mixers and fodder mills. What have you done? 
  The statement also appealed to police officers to join the 
Islamic Group. 
  The statement did not refer once to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
in 
Hebron despite its lengthy talk on Bosnia and the mujahidin in 
Algeria, Tunisia, Kashmir, Libya, Burma, Morocco, Iraq, and 
Syria. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Investigations carried out by the State Security 
[Prosecution Office] in the case involving recent bank bombings 
indicate that deceased terrorist Yasir Zaki collaborated with 
defendants held in connection with this case, providing them 
with explosives before his death. 
  An official security source says that the electric circuits 
[al- dawa'ir al-kahraba'iyah] found at the bomb sites were made 
in Afghanistan, the timers in China, and the explosive material 
in Russia. According to the same source, police have discovered 
the hideouts of key terrorists and started a search in six 
governorates to arrest them.

  [Text] The Home Ministry's annual report for the year 
1993-94 says that the unabated aiding and abetting of terrrorism 
from across the border in Jammu and Kashmir [J and K] is coupled 
with growing infiltration of foreign nationals and mercenaries 
into the state. It said efforts were made to destabilize and 
destroy the democratic institutions by the fear of the gun and 
to change the demographic profile in parts of the state. The 
report also regretted that new trend was observed in the form of 
efforts to spread violence in the Jammu region, particularly to 
Doda District. Referring to the government's efforts to expose 
the false propaganda and the role of Pakistan in fuelling 
terrorism in the state, the report gives details of several 
initiatives launched during the year for accelerating 
development and economic activity in J and K. 
  On Punjab, the report observed that the situation there has 
shown a marked inprovement. The report also highlighted various 
steps taken by the government to curb communal violence in 
general and that which was related to the Ayodhya incident. 
Other steps taken by the government on the Ayodhya issue were 
also given in the report.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bakhtiar Affair: Public </F>
Prosecutor's Charge Is Crushing for the Mullahs] 
  [Excerpt] This has never happened before: A state is 
directly implicated, with incriminating evidence, in a judicial 
terrorism dossier. A finger has been pointed at Iran in Shapur 
Bakhtiar's murder, the shah's former prime minister, who was 
assassinated on 6 August 1991 in his peaceful villa Suresne, on 
the outskirts of Paris. This ultrasensitive dossier, which 
after two years of investigation consists of several thousand 
pages, should soon come to a conclusion. Within the next few 
days, the Chamber of Accusation of the Paris Court of Appeal, 
which met last Monday, will make a decision: Either to remand 
the suspects accused in the assassination of the Tehran regime's 
opponent to the Assize Court; to request more information; or to 
simply shelve the case on the basis of a nonsuit ruling. In 
theory, nine suspects, all Iranians or of Iranian origin, could 
be called to the dock. In theory, because only three of them 
were arrested and imprisoned in France. Of all the members of 
the commando unit that, on 6 August 1991 evaded the vigilance of 
the CRS [Republican Security Police] and entered Bakhtiar's 
residence, the police could catch only Ali Rad Vakili [name as 
published] after a long chase through Paris, Lyon, Sallances, 
Valence, Annecy, and Lake Geneva. The other defendants, against 
whom international warrants for arrest have been issued, are 
still on the run or back in Iran. 
  Judge Bruguiere's preliminary investigation and the 177-page 
final charge by the public prosecutor link the Tehran mullahs. 
The document of the antiterrorist section abounds with details. 
It incriminates no fewer than three Iranian ministries: the 
Telecommunications Ministry, an adviser of which allegedly 
helped two of the murderers get visas; the Foreign Ministry, one 
of whose officers, Zeynal Sarhadi [name as published], is 
accused of having supervised the commando members' escape from 
France; and the Intelligence and Security Ministry, which is 
mentioned several times in the public prosecutor's report. 
[Information Minister] 'Ali Fallahian himself, vice minister at 
the time of the murder, appears to have been one of those who 
ordered Bakhtiar's murder. His name and his private telephone 
number were found in the diary of one of the defendants 
imprisoned in France, a former journalist and correspondent in 
Paris. The conclusions of the Public Prosecution, written down 
black on white in its charge, are very meaningful: "The Iranian 
intelligence services effectively participated in the operation 
of the criminal association" set up to murder the former prime 
minister who was ousted by Imam Khomeyni in 1979. More evidence 
needed in support of these conclusions? The dossier contains a 
telephone number linked to Tehran's special services and which 
was called several times by some of the accused. And the 
dossier provides a very detailed description of a structured 
logistical network between Iran, France, Switzerland, and 
Turkey, which was uncovered with the help of telephone listings. 
Tehran is still denying these accusations. [passage omitted]

Dismissed After Wave of Disturbances Over High Cost of Living"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- [passage 
omitted] The Iraqi "Free Revolutionary Officers Movement" 
[IFROM] has revealed that there was an attempt to assassinate 
Iraqi Defense Minister 'Ali Hasan al-Majid 9 March. 
  In a statement, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT yesterday, the movement said that one of its units 
carried out the operation, in which 'Ali Hasan al-Majid 
sustained leg and hand injuries and his aide, Police Major Salih 
Arjah, and two guards were killed outside the Iraqi defense 
minister's home in Baghdad. 
  The statement said that the nucleus of the IFROM was formed 
before Saddam Husayn's forces invaded Kuwait and that it 
includes a group of senior officers and soldiers, including 
prominent officers in important positions. 
  The statement added that 136 IFROM officers and soldiers 
have 
been martyred in operations against the regime's forces and that 
in the first two months of this year it distributed thousands of 
antiregime leaflets in the camps of al-Rashid, al-Taji, 
al-Suwayrah, al-Rashidiyah, and Khan Bani-Sa'id. 
  It urged the Iraqi opposition forces to unite and end their 
political rivalry, and it stressed that the desired change 
should emanate from within Iraq and from within the Armed Forces. 
  It also said that it strives for a truly democratic regime 
in 
Iraq, for Iraq's return to the Arab fold, for fraternal and 
good-neighborly relations with the neighboring states, and for 
the reconstruction of a strong Iraqi economy.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted on UN renewing blockade] It is 
obvious that the issue of lifting or maintaining the blockade 
has become a matter of life and death for the Iraqi people. 
Therefore, the Iraqi people have the right to use every way 
their enlightened political leadership believes to be right to 
confront the mysteries of the political conspiracy against them 
in order to lift the blockade, to reassess all the positions 
that have led to the continued blockade, and to create the right 
opportunity and take the right position and step to save Iraq's 
people from the injustice it is facing as a result of the damned 
blockade.

  [Text] Within the framework of their courageous operations 
against units and men of tyrant Saddam's regime, whose hands are 
drenched with the Iraqi people's blood, the heroes of the 
Islamic resistance recently killed the criminal Jabir Kawi, 
member of the al-Muthanna branch of the 'Aflaqite ruling party. 
This was reported by our sources in southern Iraq. They said 
that this heroic operation created a state of fear and panic 
among the tyrant's security organs, which have been placed on a 
state of alert and have deployed patrols to arrest those who 
carried out the operation. The latter managed to return to 
their bases safely.

  [Text] Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] forces in Judaea and Samaria, said this 
evening that the three terrorists killed by the security forces 
in Hebron belonged to one of the most prominent terror squads in 
the territories. Maj. Gen. Mufaz told correspondents that so 
far three bodies were found in the building in which the 
terrorists barricaded themselves. Mufaz says these terrorists 
were involved in a long series of attacks, including the murder 
of Mordekhay and Shalom Lapid in Hebron, and the murder of 
Avraham Zarbiv near the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
  Maj. Gen. Mufaz said that following the operation in Hebron 
only 10 Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad 
terrorists remain operating in Judaea and Samaria. Mufaz added 
that the Hebron operation was made possible by strenuous Shin 
Bet efforts. According to Mufaz the house in which the 
terrorists hid served as a storehouse and a launch pad for Hamas 
terror acts.

  One of the men was seriously wounded and taken to the Soroka

the settlement of 'Ateret. According to initial reports, two 
Egged bus passengers were seriously injured. Our correspondent 
in the territories Golan Yokhpaz reports from the studio: 
  There was a shooting attack near the settlement of 'Ateret, 
which is situated north of Jerusalem. Apparently two Israelis 
were seriously injured and three others were also wounded, 
although their condition remains unclear. The Israelis were hit 
by gunfire directed at an Egged No. 468 bus which drove by the 
settlement of 'Ateret in the Binyamin area on the Bi'r Zayt 
bypass. The bus, was travelling from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv and 
picking up passengers from settlements in the Binyamin area. 
Seven Israeli ambulances are currently racing to the scene in 
order to evacuate the wounded, apparently to Hadassah-'En Kerem 
Hospital in Jerusalem. Large Army forces are also making their 
way to the scene of the attack in order to treat the wounded and 
close off the site. 
  We have just received an update on the condition of the 
wounded: five are currently receiving first aid at the scene and 
initial reports indicate that two of the wounded are in serious 
condition and will soon be evacuated to hospital.

Here is a report by our correspondent in the territories Golan 
Yokhpaz: 
  A leaflet signed by PFLP activists and in which the 
organization assumes responsibility for the terrorist attack on 
a bus near the settlement of 'Ateret, north of Jerusalem, was 
disseminated in Ramallah this morning. This is the first 
operation in the framework of settling scores between the 
Palestinian people and the Zionists following the massacre in 
the Cave of the Patriarchs, the PFLP activists state in their 
leaflet. Our forces will not cease their activities until a 
just and comprehensive solution has been found to the 
Palestinian problem and until a Palestinian state with holy 
Jerusalem as its capital has been founded. The leaflet goes on 
to say that the attack was carried out by two PFLP fighters who 
succeeded in escaping. [passage omitted] 
  Two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists were 
arrested this morning several hundred meters north of the Erez 
checkpoint. Armed with a knife, the two managed to make their 
way out of the Gaza Strip without permits to enter Israel. They 
planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Israel. They were 
carrying a leaflet signed by Hamas and a copy of the Koran.

<F P=106> [Report by Yig'al Wilfend and ITIM] </F>
  [Excerpt] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has claimed 
responsibility for the attack Monday night near the settlement 
of 'Ateret north of Ramallah. 
  A leaflet distributed yesterday in the Gaza Strip, Ramallah, 
and East Jerusalem noted that the attack near Bi'r Zayt in which 
five settlers were wounded had been perpetrated by 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam troops. 
  The leaflet added that this was "the beginning of the 
implementation of the plan to expel the settlers from all the 
territories," as had been promised in a previous leaflet in 
which the settlers were given an ultimatum to leave by 15 March. 
The authors contend that this ultimatum had already caused 
several families to leave Qiryat Arba'. However, the leaflet 
noted, Hamas does not consider this sufficient "and will 
continue to strike until the last settler leaves." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Barukh Marzel has announced that he will turn 
himself in through the mediation of several Knesset members 
[MK's]. This is because, among other reasons, he fears that the 
authorities will use firearms during his arrest. In a letter 
sent to his wife, Marzel asserted that he is unarmed and has no 
intention of resisting arrest. 
  Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that Marzel, one of the 
leaders of the Kakh movement, has been in hiding from the police 
for several weeks.

<F P=106> [Report by Nicole Krau] </F>
  [Excerpts] Last Sunday, when the decision to define all 
right-wing movements as terror organizations was announced, 
Kakh's Tel Aviv branch closed down. The branch had been located 
on Hanegev Street in the old Central Bus Station in the past 12 
years, having moved there from Dizengoff. "We seem to be 
closed," one of the movement's leading figures says, "but in 
practice, the branch's entire activity has been moved to a safe 
apartment in downtown Tel Aviv, in which an activist family 
lives. The location of the branch will be changed occasionally 
to prevent exposure by the security forces." 
  The activist's remarks reveal that Kakh activists use five 
safe apartments in the Tel Aviv area. The apartments are 
situated mainly in south Tel Aviv, Hatiqva neighborhood, Bat 
Yam, and Ramat 'Amidar in Ramat Gan. The activist adds that the 
movement has hundreds of activists and supporters in the Dan 
District. According to Kakh activists, Kakh and EYAL [Irgun 
Yehudi Lohem] leaders and the heads of Kahana Hay have recently 
discussed consolidation. [passage omitted] 
  One of the Kakh leaders in the Dan District has said that 
the 
movement would suspend its activities until the High Court of 
Justice rules on the movement's appeal against the orders 
outlawing it. They plan later "to start taking care of the Arab 
problem in Yafo." At first they will distribute in Yafo 
leaflets demanding that the Arab residents leave the city, and 
later they will proceed to damage property. "We will burn their 
cars and houses, but we will not attack people for the time 
being," he said. 
  In addition, the Kakh people plan to act against the 
moderate 
right wing and the left-wing organizations in the city and to 
attack Meretz centers and the Labor building. The activist says 
that reporters, who attack the movement in media, will receive 
life threats. 
  According to Kakh activists, they expect to receive weapons 
soon. They maintain that the weapons will be smuggled in by 
movement activists who are due to immigrate to Israel from the 
United States -- people whose political views are unknown to the 
security services. "We are defined as a terrorist organization, 
and as such, we have nothing to lose. We feel as if we were 
ETZEL and LEHI [pre-state underground organizations], and we 
will use their methods in our operations," the activist sums up. 
The police say they have not as yet reorganized their approach 
to the Kakh personnel. For now, the issue will be addressed by 
the National Unit for Serious Crimes Investigation.

  [Text] Beirut, March 24, IRNA -- The Zionist regime's 
ruthless massacre of children in South Lebanon has prompted a 
wave of condemnation and hatred among the country's Islamic 
circles. 
  Prominent Lebanese religious leader, Allamah Sayyid Hasan 
Fadlallah, commenting on the incident, said here today that the 
massacre of the innocent people and students could not be 
justified under any excuse, political or religious. Lashing out 
at the international organizations and the United States for 
their deadly silence towards the latest Zionist crime, he said 
the U.S. and Europe which claim to be vanguards and advocates of 
human rights, did not even utter a word in condemnation of the 
savage shelling of al-Nabatiyah. 
  Several innocent students were killed and wounded in the 
shelling of the Israeli Army. `This silence only proves that 
the U.S. is an accomplice in the killing of the people of South 
Lebanon,' he said. 
  The secretary general of Hizballah, Sayyid Husayn Nasrallah 
also strongly criticized Washington's policies towards the 
Zionist regime's crimes, and said: `Washington's silence once 
again proved that the rights of the nations and human values in 
general are of the least importance for the U.S. and other 
arrogant powers, and that they only care for the Zionists and 
their children.' 
  The Hizballah secretary general called on the Lebanese 
people 
to get united in the fight against the Israeli aggressions and 
reiterated his party's all-out support for the anti-Zionist 
struggle. 
  Leader of the Islamic Amal Movement, Husayn al-Musawi called 
the U.S. `the gang leader of the world's terrorists' and said 
Washington was the enemy of the nations and universal peace. 
`The brand of peace that the United States is trying to impose 
on the countries of the region, is only a cover-up to serve its 
own illegitimate interests,' he added. 
  Al-Musawi also strongly criticized the United Nations 
Security Council and said the organization was an executive of 
Washington's terroristic policies. 
  Meanwhile, the association of Lebanese Muslim ulama in a 
statement issued here today, termed the U.S. `the great satan' 
and a government without any humanitarian intentions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fadlallah: U.S. Decision Behind </F>
al-Nabatiyah Massacre; Israelis Will Drink From Same Cup"] 
  [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Scholar Muhammad Husayn 
Fadlallah has said that "there is a U.S.-Western terrorism 
working to kill us daily in Lebanon and Palestine with U.S. 
weapons." He also said that "a U.S. decision and U.S. brutality 
are behind the massacre committed by Israel against our people 
in the south." He said that "those killing our kinfolk and 
cities will drink from the same cup and will suffer the effects 
of this experience, because it is not that we like to kill 
children, women, and the elderly, as they did, but because we 
could reach these results when the tragedy develops into more 
than one people's revolution and more than one state of 
bereavement." 
  He added: "We understand that a war might move to stir up a 
problem with troops here and there, and we understand that some 
civilians can be killed when there is a state of war, but we 
cannot -- in the context of any political, religious, or 
cultural position -- understand why civilians, in particular 
children returning from schools, should be bombarded with a 
brutal mentality that can aim its shells against people working 
in their schools, markets, and homes, especially in areas where 
there are no military personnel or posts at all." 
  He said: "That illegitimate state is a state of massacres 
that murders children, women, and the elderly; blows up hotels, 
churches, and mosques; and kills Muslim and Christian worshipers 
in cold blood." Fadlallah wondered: "If the children killed 
while returning from their schools and the innocent people 
killed while at their homes or on their way to work were Jews, 
would the United States have kept silent? Would Europe have 
kept silent? Would that world, which calls itself civilized and 
developed, have kept silent? Or would it have instigated the 
entire world against what it terms extremists, fanatics, and 
savages.... We have not heard a single word from the arrogant 
world or an official word from Lebanon. Are they all frightened 
to condemn Israel?... [It seems that] what is required is for 
everyone to give Israel everything in order to risk the peace, 
as U.S. President (Bill Clinton) says." 
  He said: "When we look at all this spite and all these 
missiles launched against civilians, we see the U.S. decision, 
U.S. brutality, U.S. terrorism, and U.S. arrogance, joined from 
time to time by British and French arrogance." Addressing 
citizens, he said: "Store all this inside you and teach your 
children that the United States is the cause of all your 
problems, as it is the one which gives the enemy all the means 
of power and obstructs any condemnation of him." He added: "It 
is the mujahidin who represent Lebanon's strength and freedom, 
not those who engage in internal sectarian predicaments and 
massacres."

  [Text] The Standing Military Tribunal presided over by 
Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Halim Khurbutli has adjourned the 
trial of the following suspects until 13 April: 'Abd-al-Hakim 
Hulayhil, Bilal Mustafa al-Kasan, Husayn 'Abd-al-Wahhab, Ziyad 
Ihsan Tut, and Hasan Muhammad Ballat. They have been charged 
with terrorist acts on the al-Balamand road on 28 June 1993, 
detonating bombs in several resorts, and possessing arms. 
  Hulayhil has confessed that he is a member of the Islamic 
Group and that he participated in detonating an explosive device 
on the road to the al-Balamand Monastery. He said his role 
consisted of tying the detonating wire in such a way that when 
the targeted bus hit it the explosion would occur six seconds 
later. Hulayhil explained that this type of denotation requires 
no special expertise. He said he received bombing training in 
al-Dinniyah several years ago. 
  Bilal al-Kasan, another suspect, said his role in that 
attack 
was to stand guard. He reported that the bombing was staged to 
retaliate for events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to expel the 
Christian clerics from al-Balamand. 
  All the suspects denied bombing tourist resorts.

  [Text] Examining Magistrate Fawzi Daghir, who is 
investigating the bombing of Sayyidat Dayr al-Balamand, today 
passed the death sentence against the six detained criminals. 
He dropped charges against defendant 'Abdallah al-Hilu, who is 
now dead. 
  Judge Daghir instructed the security service to arrest the 
real motivators. He dropped charges against two defendants 
because of a lack of evidence. 
  Judge Sa'id Mirza demanded that the death sentence be passed 
against 16 people -- three detained and 13 fugitive -- on 
charges of killing Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in 
January.

  [Excerpt] Citing Resistance sources, our security 
correspondent has reported that at 1235 today, the Resistance 
detonated an explosive device in a Mercedes car belonging to the 
Israeli intelligence as it drove along the 
al-Jarmaq-al-'Ayshiyah road. According to the same sources, the 
device killed everyone inside the car. 
  Security sources reported that two explosive devices went 
off. The first went off on the al-Jarmaq-al-'Ayshiyah road 
targeting an Israeli military vehicle. The second targeted a 
foot patrol on the al-'Ayshiyah-al-Rayhan road. Using field 
artillery, the Israeli army shelled the al-Nabatiyah-Kafr Rumman 
area. The shelling also targeted Iqlim al-Tuffah, in particular 
the Mlita and al-Luwayzah hills, from the al-Zaffatah positions. 
Israeli warplanes also overflew the area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Investigations into the recent wave of bombings 
remain the focus of attention, particularly after emerging clues 
that point clearly to the party that stands behind them. This 
prompted the army command to take basic measures and to deploy 
units in this party's centers that were used for planning these 
bombings. 
  Visitors of President Ilyas al-Hirawi, citing him, told our 
radio that there were four detainees in the bombing of the 
Sayyidat al- Najat church, and that two others managed to flee 
to the occupied border strip. 
  THE NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY, quoting concerned parties, said 
that the results of the investigations into the bombing will be 
made public next week at a meeting at Justice Minister Bahij 
Tabbarah's office.

  [Text] Citing one of the top three leaders [president, 
Chamber speaker, prime minister], the newspaper AL-HAYAH reports 
today that the network involved in the bombing of the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church has direct links to Israel, noting that the 
network leaders are linked to a local militia. The paper says 
that the network leaders had often visited the security strip 
and a European capital. 
  According to the top leader, AL-HAYAH says that the 
investigations into the incident will inevitably confirm whether 
party and militia leaders are involved in the bombing, 
particularly since the group leader, who probably has escaped to 
the Jazzin area in the security strip, was in charge of security 
affairs in a local influential militia in the Kasrawan region. 
The group leader, according to AL-HAYAH, is a relative of a 
prominent party leader. 
  AL-HAYAH also cites official sources as saying that the 
initial stage of the preparation of the explosives was conducted 
in Sinn al-Fil before the culprits moved to the Zuq area. The 
culprits then used a party center, which has often been raided, 
to assemble the explosive devices before planting them in the 
church.

  [Text] The newspaper AL-SAFIR has reported that the 
security forces arrested a fugitive suspect involved in blowing 
up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in al-Zuq. This brings the 
number of detainees who have confessed to participating in the 
crime to five, including a monk. A search is under way for six 
fugitive suspects, including the official in charge of the 
operation, who escaped to the occupied border zone. 
  AL-SAFIR adds that the detainees confessed to receiving 
their 
orders from two officers in the Mosad, the Israeli intelligence 
service. Investigations continue to determine how much the 
organizations to which the detainees belong know about the 
operation. According to AL-SAFIR, the official in charge of the 
operation is Pierre 'Ayn, a demolition expert who worked as an 
aide to a former Lebanese Forces official and who escaped to the 
occupied border zone along with two of his assistants.

  [Text] Investigating Judge Joseph Frayhah has issued 
official arrest warrants against the suspects Jirjis Tawfiq 
al-Khuri, Antoinette Yusuf Shahin, and Simon Edmund al-Kharyati 
-- all officials in the Lebanese Forces and who are already in 
custody. Warrants were also issued for the arrest of Makram 
al-Mursi 'Ali and Jerome Yusuf Diya. 
  Judge Frayhah also issued arrest warrants against the 
suspects Tony Ilyas 'Ubayd, the head of the intervention and 
protection branch of the Lebanese Forces security apparatus; 
Rushdi Tawfiq Ra'd, alias Nabil Fawzi alias Nabil Munassa, 
official of the same security apparatus; John Yusuf Shahin, 
alias Asad, official of the same security apparatus; and Vera 
Munassa, an official of the same Lebanese Forces security 
apparatus. They must be taken into custody. 
  The investigating judge will continue interrogating other 
people who are already in custody to issue the necessary remand 
orders against them. 
  Sources close to the investigation have revealed that 
several 
individuals now in custody have residence permits abroad and 
regularly moved between Lebanon and these other countries under 
various aliases, using forged passports of several 
nationalities. They used to enter Lebanon avoiding the official 
entry points, in fishing boats, via tourist areas, or by 
boarding Lebanese vessels on the high seas.

  [Text] In response to the arrest warrants issued against 
those accused in connection with the explosion at the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church, which noted that some of them belong to the 
Lebanese Forces [LF], and to the detention of Fu'ad Malik, head 
of the Administrative Committee of the Lebanese Forces Party, LF 
Commander Dr. Samir Ja'ja' held a news conference this evening 
in which he rejected the accusation of LF involvement in the 
explosion. 
  He explained that the warrants were issued in absentia since 
those accused have been abroad for a long time. Anyone can get 
in contact with them and ask them. I have never heard of two of 
the accused, who have been said to be members of the LF. 
  Dr. Ja'ja' maintained that the detention of Fu'ad Malik is 
political. He hoped that he will be allowed to appoint a 
defense lawyer, according to law and logic. Dr. Ja'ja' renewed 
his call for open trials immediately. He affirmed that he is 
ready for anything. He also affirmed that the truth will come 
out and justice will take its course. He said: We are 
reassured about our situation. We are very confident, and our 
conscience is free. 
  The LF commander said: If they want to stop the LF from 
exercising its political activity, let them try a much easier 
way. Let them stop the LF without going to all this trouble and 
misleading the public. 
  Dr. Ja'ja' affirmed that pressure, accusations, and such 
measures will not change the convictions of the LF.

  [Text] As part of the storming and search campaigns 
undertaken by the military and security forces, a Lebanese Army 
unit last night stormed the housing project building belonging 
to the former Lebanese Forces in the township of Burayj, Qada' 
Jubayl. Large amounts of weapons and ammunition bearing Hebrew 
lettering were seized. 
  Among the estimated four truck loads of weapons are 300 M-16 
rifles, 20 RPG's, and 20 machine guns in addition to hand 
grenades, radio equipment, and bullet-proof jackets. 
  Another Army unit this morning stormed a second Lebanese 
Forces center in al-Nab'ah. Six 107-mm rockets were found on 
the center's lower floor. 
  Security sources pointed out that the continuing possession 
of weapons and ammunition caches and confessions by people 
arrested in connection with the Sayyidat al-Najat Church crime, 
saying they were instructed to gather information on the 
Lebanese Army centers in particular areas, again prove the bad 
intentions behind this conduct. 
  Elsewhere, naval targets were monitored off the Jubayl and 
Beirut coast today. This called for tightening security 
measures among the Lebanese Army forces along the Lebanese coast 
to prevent it from being used for illegal transportation.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Hizballah Secretary General </F>
Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah by al-Manar Television "aired" on 22 
February] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Asked if Hizballah is prepared 
for the future in light of the settlement, Hizballah Secretary 
General 'Allamah Sayyid Hasan 
Nasrallah said: The leadership responsibility dictates that 
Hizballah and its leadership study and prepare for all future 
contingencies. This is a major concern. As a principal force 
and trend in the country, Hizballah is concerned with preparing 
for every eventuality. [passage omitted] 
  Asked about Hizballah's future after the settlement, his 
eminence said: Nobody can cancel the trend in Lebanon called 
Hizballah. That's one thing. The other thing is that talk of 
settlement possibilities is premature. It's in nobody's 
interest to discuss how to deal with what will happen if peace 
is established. We are not prepared to give an answer to the 
intelligence service free. 
  Asked whether there are differences engulfing Hizballah 
ranks, Nasrallah said: Not every one in Hizballah thinks the 
same. Views are usually raised. But differences are always 
settled through a higher religious authority (al-Marja'iyah]. 
This constitutes a basic immunity. There is a collective 
leadership in Hizballah, so its decision is unanimous. 
Asked if there is any connection between the Resistance 
operations and the political situation, his eminence said that 
the Resistance operations are not subject to any political 
circumstances. Consequently, the operations are governed by one 
factor: The fighters' capabilities and the field conditions 
they face. [passage omitted 
  On Hizballah's conditions for joining any future government, 
his eminence said: We are not hungry for power sharing and thus 
we do not seek to enter just any government. Joining or not 
joining a government is open to study and debate every time a 
government is about to be formed. What concerns us is the role 
this government will play, its policy statement, plan, and 
credibility. If we can see the program that the policy 
statement reflects and that the way the government is made up 
gives it credibility and if we find that its program and 
statement are in line, not with all our policies, but with the 
main issues that we believe in, primarily the liberation and 
Resistance, then we will not object to joining it. 
  Asked if Hizballah might join a government under al-Hariri, 
he said: I don't want to rush Hizballah's decision on this but 
in my mind and following the 13 September massacre, I don't 
think so. We have blamed the executive authority, both the 
regime and the government, for the massacre. Both are 
responsible. And the government did not behave responsibly 
after the massacre. Withholding confidence or submitting a 
motion of no confidence in the government at the Chamber of 
Deputies is always possible but we must choose its timing 
because we are not after a no-confidence motion just to make a 
point. We have made our point with something bigger than the 
no-confidence motion, and the people echoed it in their slogans 
and shouts, which were not politically orchestrated. If we 
thought a no-confidence motion would bring down the government, 
we would not hesitate to submit it for one moment. We have 
raised the slogan of bringing down the government and we 
continue in that direction but there are priorities. Because of 
the country's delicate circumstances, Hizballah has resorted to 
no negative measures or violent methods. We accuse some circles 
in power of seeking to cause a collision between Hizballah and 
the Lebanese Army; they seek to use the Army to strike at 
Hizballah and striking Hizballah means striking at the 
Resistance. They are trying to find motives or accusations to 
use against Hizballah. The Lebanese authority made commitments 
to Christopher during the seven- day war in which the Islamic 
Resistance in particular used all its weight, mujahidin, 
weapons, and resources. After some time, the Lebanese authority 
brought the Army to the area of operations of the UN troops as 
part of a clear-cut and explicit commitment. This is not just 
newspaper talk; we have complete information that promises were 
made to repress and disarm the Resistance.

  [Text] Paris, 23 Mar (MENA) -- Libya has announced that it 
agrees to hand over two of its citizens suspected in the 
Lockerbie downing for trial at the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague with the participation of judges from 
Scotland. 
  This was announced by Sa'd Mujbir, secretary of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee at the General People's Congress in Libya, in 
a speech he delivered at the meeting of the International 
Parliamentary Union currently being held in Paris. 
  Sa'd Mujbir said that "to you and through you, we declare to 
the whole world that we officially accept the proposal by Mr. 
Black, professor of law in Scotland, for the Libyans to be tried 
before the International Court of Justice in The Hague with the 
participation of judges from Scotland". 
  It is worth noting that Colonel al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 
Libyan revolution, has previously agreed for the two Libyans to 
be tried at the International Court of Justice without 
mentioning Scottish participation, but this was rejected every 
time by the United States and Britain.

  [Text] The chief of the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] 
Awami National Party Begum Nasim Wali Khan escaped an 
assassination attempt while on her way from Wali Bagh village to 
Peshawar today. A press note issued by the NWFP home department 
in Peshawar said between 0730 and 0800 [0230 to 0300 GMT] Begum 
Nasim Wali Khan along with her driver was proceeding in a 
vehicle from her village toward Peshawar. About three kms from 
her village on (Takhtwai- Razia) Road, her vehicle was 
reportedly signalled to stop by some armed men, who started 
firing simultaneously. The driver of the vehicle received minor 
injuries while Begum Nasim Wali Khan remained unhurt. On 
hearing the shots, the police mobile party, which was on routine 
patrol in the vicinity, immediately rushed to the spot. The 
accused attempted to escape. However, they were pursued and the 
police party succeeded in apprehending two of them along with 
two Klashnikovs within a matter of minutes. During the 
encounter with the police party, one of the accused sustained 
injuries. He has been admitted to hospital, where his condition 
is reported to be serious. 
  A special team has been constituted to investigated the case 
on top priority basis. The provincial government has also 
decided to institute a high-level judicial inquiry into the 
incident to be headed by a judge of the high court, for which 
the chief justice of Peshawar High Court has already been 
requested.

  [Text] Commissioner of Police M.B. Kaushal chose to 
describe the four Pakistanis, charged under TADA [Terrorism and 
Disruptive Activites Prevention Act] along with two others, as 
highly trained and battle-hardened men who were well-versed in 
guerilla warfare and the use of rockets and artillery guns 
(courtesy the Afghan war). 
  Khalid Pahelwan one of the four Pakistanis, is rated high in 
the Lahore-based outfit Islami Inquilabi Mahaz (IIM) for 
successfully participating in an armed attack on an Indian Army 
post at Mendhar in Poonch district early last year. 
  Three others from IIM are believed to have entered India. 
Kaushal named them as Basharat, IIM finance secretary, Nadeem 
and Mohammed Farooq. It is believed Basharat and Nadeem are 
currently in Nepal. There is no trace of Farooq who was supposed 
to enter India from Bangladesh. 
  IIM is headed by Imtiaz Ahmed Shami, a terrorist who has 
also 
seen action in Afghanistan and worked with Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO). This group was sent to India by retired 
Pakistan army major Ehsan-ul-Haq who owns a knitwear company in 
Lahore. 
  Kaushal said incriminating documents, some 16 kg of high 
explosives, seven electric detonators, two hand grenades, a 
fuse, two Pakistani passports, identification cards of health 
clubs in Delhi, diaries containing addresses and telephone 
numbers of various people in Pakistan, West Asia and United 
Kingdom were recovered from one of the hideouts in Dayalpura in 
the Gokulpuri area. 
  The raid on the second hideout in Khureji -- from where 
Taimur Ali and the Bangladeshi Mohammed Raeef were nabbed -- led 
to the seizure of eight floppies. 
  The documents were in compressed mode and had to be inflated 
before reading. 
  The notes appeared to be taken from expert handbooks on 
improvised explosive devices and delivered to Pakistan for use 
in the Afghanistan war. 
  The floppies contained material which, when printed, ran 
over 
200 pages. It was all about the manufacture of disposable 
silencers, incendiary brick and torch, auto disablement, delay 
mechanism, various types of shaped charges, explosives from 
locally available material, the secret science of convert inks 
and easy production of poison. 
  The Khureji hideout, from where a large quantity of 
chemicals 
was recovered, was being used as a laboratory for manufacturing 
explosive devices. 
  According to Kaushal, the interrogation of the six revealed 
they had been told to establish bases in different metropolitan 
towns of India and then strike mainly with explosives on railway 
tracks, stations, bus stands, telephone lines, government and 
commercial buildings. 
  They even intended to poison wells to create panic and 
cripple the economy by damaging the transport and communication 
system. 
  They had been instructed to acquire Indian identities and 
merge with locals, Kaushal said. 
  Diaries recovered from their hideouts revealed they were 
learning Hindi. 
  Kaushal said Pakistan's ISI [Interservices Intelligence] was 
using Nepal and Bangladesh to launch subversive activities in 
India and was also diverting the help it obtained during the 
Afghan war. There had been as many as sixty explosions in the 
country after the demolition of the disputed Ayodhya structure, 
he said.

  [Text] The issue of the assault on Sudan's NIF [National 
Islamic Front] Secretary General Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, who is 
considered by many the power behind the throne in Sudan today, 
at Ottawa Airport nearly 20 months ago resurfaced prominently 
when the Canadian court considering the case acquitted Hashim 
Badr-al-Din, a former international Sudanese karate player and 
the man charged with committing the assault. 
  During the trial, numerous questions were raised about the 
circumstances engulfing the assault and about al-Turabi's 
health. Since the court issued its verdict, numerous pending 
issues have continued, such as: how has the incident affected 
al-Turabi physically and psychologically? Has he recovered from 
it or is he still suffering from some of its effects? Was there 
really a plot behind the assault, as some parties have implied, 
or was the attack an individual act motivated by a "feeling of 
being wronged by what is going on in Sudan," as Hashim 
Badr-al-Din has said? What are the causes of the clamor which 
accompanied al-Turabi's visit to Canada? Why did the Canadian 
consular office in Washington refuse to grant al-Turabi an entry 
visa initially but changed its mind afterward? Was the visit to 
Canada a missionary and call-oriented visit, as al-Turabi said, 
or was it to hold political and trade talks and to discuss 
transactions in the areas of transportation, banking, 
communications, and pharmaceuticals, according to one of three 
Canadian parliamentary deputies who were to meet with al-Turabi 
during his visit? 
  There are other questions: how did the Sudanese opposition 
in 
Canada learn of al-Turabi's itinerary, even though it had not 
been announced officially? What are the circumstances that led 
to the lack of guards to protect al-Turabi before he left 
Ottawa? Was al-Turabi traveling under his real name or under the 
assumed name of "Martin Loony," as some parties have implied? 
  These questions and others were raised during the trial, and 
some of them have remained unanswered, thus adding more mystery 
and excitement to this issue. 
  In a series of articles, AL-MAJALLAH will review some 
aspects 
of the case, of the trial, and of the accompanying controversy. 
It will also publish for the first time a photograph of Dr. 
al-Turabi in the hospital room immediately after the incident. 
This was the first photograph presented to the jury as part of 
the evidence aimed at acquainting the court with the injuries 
sustained by al-Turabi in the incident. Following is the second 
part of this report: 
  Since the assault on Dr. Hasan al-Turabi at Ottawa Airport 
in 
May 1992, numerous questions have been raised regarding the 
health of the Sudanese National Islamic Front secretary general 
and on whether al-Turabi has recovered from the consequences of 
the incident or whether he is still suffering from it physically 
and psychologically despite the lapse of 19 months since the 
assault. Even though al-Turabi has resumed his activities and 
even though he made his first two "official" foreign trips last 
year, visiting Afghanistan, via Pakistan, and the Vatican, 
numerous Sudanese, including some officials and some who are 
close to al-Turabi's family, say that the incident has left its 
imprints on al-Turabi physically and psychologically. These 
people reiterate that al-Turabi "disappears" from time to time 
for a period of one week for treatment from the effects of the 
Ottawa incident. Interpretations vary on the details. Some say 
that the NIF secretary general is taken to a place known only to 
a few, where he stays for a week out of sight to be treated with 
some drugs that have an evident effect on the man and on his 
general capabilities. Others say that he resorts to complete 
rest during this disappearance because he feels extremely tired 
and exhausted after any effort that he exerts. 
  In addition to some officials who work with the current 
regime and who do not wish to reveal their identity, Aldo Ajo 
Deng, deputy speaker of Sudan's Transitional National Assembly 
(parliament) who broke away from the government last month and 
applied for political asylum in England, has also talked about 
this issue. He said that al-Turabi "is hidden" from sight for 
one week a month to rest and regain his energy, which seems to 
have declined greatly since the Ottawa incident. He added that 
numerous people have noticed that al-Turabi tires quickly and 
that his train of thought is affected if he takes part in a long 
conversation or in a public event that requires one to stand and 
concentrate for a long time. 
<H5>  Feeling of Exhaustion </H5>
  In a press interview in the wake of the incident, al-Turabi 
said that he felt exhausted. Moreover, the physician who treated 
him at Civic Hospital in Canada told the court which considered 
Hashim Badr-al-Din's case last year that the patient (al-Turabi) 
had not regained his normal condition when he left the hospital. 
On top of this, the medical report that was submitted to the 
court noted that al-Turabi may need treatment in a "special 
unit" in the United States or Switzerland to regain his fitness. 
It is not known to date whether al-Turabi has received such 
special treatment, keeping in mind that he has not visited the 
United States since the Ottawa incident and that it has not been 
announced or learned that he has visited Switzerland since that 
date, even though rumors were circulated in Sudanese circles 
last year about a "secret visit" al-Turabi made to Switzerland. 
<H5>  Extent of Injuries </H5>
  Al-Turabi (62) suffered a brain concussion, lost his speech, 
and experienced extreme weakness on the right side of his body 
as a result of the incident. A Canadian police officer is 
reported to have said in the wake of the incident that the blow 
al-Turabi received from Badr-al-Din did not cause much damage 
and that the main injury resulted when al-Turabi's head collided 
with the ground when he fell. That collision caused a nearly 
two-inch long wound on the right side of the back of his head. 
The wound did not need to be surgically stitched but it caused a 
brain concussion, which began as minor but intensified by the 
third day, according to the report of Dr. Vasco da Silva, the 
physician who treated al-Turabi at Civic Hospital. 
  Before the court considering Badr-al-Din's case, da Silva 
described al-Turabi's injuries as follows: "The injuries can be 
described as three parts: al-Turabi suffered a superficial wound 
to the scalp, and this is the first part. The second part is the 
slight concussion which basically manifests itself in a passing 
or transient loss of consciousness lasting between 15 to 20 
minutes. The more serious injury, which represents the third 
part, was suffered in what can be characterized as a brain 
concussion. 
  "As a result of these injuries, especially the third part, 
al-Turabi experienced unconsciousness and exhaustion. He started 
to breathe haltingly, and he lost all ability to speak and to 
respond to verbal commands. This dictated his return to the 
intensive care room on the third day of his admission to the 
hospital." da Silva characterized the loss of ability to respond 
to verbal commands as the "worrying element" which alerted him 
to the fact that al-Turabi's head injury was not as slight as it 
had seemed to be initially. 
  In his testimony before the court, Dasilva added: "I 
realized 
then that there was something worrying about him (al-Turabi) 
because he wasn't able to talk properly. When one spoke to him, 
he answered on a totally different issue, meaning that his 
disturbed ability to speak made me conclude that there was a 
positional fault in the brain. This was confirmed by our [later] 
diagnosis, which showed what I have characterized as a brain 
concussion." 
<H5>  Court Dialogue </H5>
  The following dialogue then took place between Dr. da Silva 
and the attorney defending Badr-al-Din (the defendant) in court: 
  Attorney: When you say that he (al-Turabi) was 
giving illogical answers, do you mean that he was unable to talk? 
  Da Silva: He talked. Yes, he talked on the first 
and second day after his admission to the hospital. But if one 
asked him: How are you? He would respond: in Toronto, thank you. 
  Attorney: But there was no problem in his ability 
to speak? 
  Da Silva: This is what one can call impossible or 
disturbed speech. What I mean is this sort of illogical 
responses. 
  Attorney: Did you decide that there was a 
concussion after the sectional scanning of the brain, or did you 
make your decision before the scan was conducted. 
  Da Silva: I felt that there was something wrong 
with the brain before the sectional scan was made. The result of 
the scan confirmed my doubts. 
  Questions and answers then revolved around permission given 
by Dr. da Silva to a physician named 'Abd-al-Amin, who arrived 
from Chicago on 27 May 1992 (two days after the incident), to 
examine Dr. al-Turabi at his family's request. The attorney 
wondered if it was normal to permit Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin to examine 
al-Turabi even though he had come from abroad, meaning that he 
did not belong to the staff working at Civic Hospital. In 
response, Dr. da Silva said that this was not unusual and noted 
that Dr. al-Amin suggested two kinds of drugs to treat al-Turabi. 
  According to the medical report, Dr. al-Turabi had an 
allergic reaction and developed a skin rash because of one of 
the two drugs. Dr. al-Turabi also experienced weakness on the 
right side of his body and a total loss of his speech ability. 
After 19 days in the hospital, there was improvement in the 
condition of Dr. al-Turabi, who regained his ability to speak 
and started to walk a little around his room. He also continued 
to take his medication. 
<H5>  Condition Engulfed in Ambiguity </H5>
  Al-Turabi's health condition was encircled by walls of 
"official" silence through his stay at the hospital. Civic 
Hospital officials were asked not to make any statements about 
his health. Reporters' questions were referred to the Sudanese 
Embassy in Ottawa, which either refused to answer the questions 
or offered vague answers. 
  Ambiguity continued to engulf al-Turabi's condition even 
after his return to Khartoum on 21 June 1992. The authorities 
concerned prevented people from visiting him, and only a few 
relatives and close associates saw him. Writing about 
al-Turabi's return, AL-INQADH AL-WATANI, the government paper, 
said, "al-Turabi's kinsmen, and those who love him and who are 
close to him and who were around him or in contact with the 
Canadian hospital where he was being treated, received saddening 
medical reports at times and encouraging reports at other times. 
But the final days of his weeks of recuperation witnessed 
improvement that doctors could not believe and that surprised 
observers, considering that he began to regain his health and to 
act as if nothing had happened." 
  SUNA, the Sudanese News Agency, also circulated a report on 
al-Turabi's return to Khartoum from Ottawa in which it said that 
he was "in good health." But all other reports and sources said 
that, even though al-Turabi felt great improvement in his 
health, he continued to suffer from the effects of the incident 
for a long time. The first time the Sudanese people saw 
al-Turabi after his incident was in a "silent film" shown by 
Sudanese television on a visit which Lieutenant-General 'Umar 
al-Bashir, the Revolutionary Command Council chairman, paid to 
al-Turabi's home to reassure himself about al-Turabi's health 
nearly one week after he had returned to Khartoum. In the film, 
the NIF secretary general looked pale and exhausted and his 
voice could not be heard during his conversation with 
Lieutenant-General al-Bashir. 
  Some people who were permitted to visit al-Turabi weeks 
after 
his return have reported that he could not stand for a long 
time, even though he leaned on a walking stick, and that he also 
had difficulty moving his right arm and foot because of a slight 
paralysis resulting form the incident. He seemed to have 
difficulty speaking. It was also noticed that he talked about 
nothing other than the incident. Some people interpreted this as 
part of the psychological effect of the assault and injury. 
  On 31 July 1992, a ceremony was held in the Green Square in 
Khartoum on the occasion of al-Turabi's return and "recovery." 
Al-Turabi delivered an address in which he said, according to 
SUNA, "God fated me to survive and He prolonged my life after 
they paralyzed a part of my body and stopped my tongue from 
speaking. But God has restored my speech to me and has healed my 
paralyzed side." Al-Turabi added, "Muslims are the source of the 
invocation for my recovery." He also alluded to a plot to 
assassinate him. 
  Despite the lapse of 18 months since that ceremony, there 
are 
still those who say that al-Turabi, even though he has largely 
recovered his health and his abilities, continues to suffer from 
some effects of that incident and that he still needs medication 
and periods of treatment and rest. 
<H5>  Questions About His Future </H5>
  The assault on al-Turabi created great confusion within the 
NIF ranks and it almost touched off an open conflict within the 
NIF leadership ranks between those aspiring to succeed al-Turabi 
and those advocating a change in the leadership system so as to 
fill the void that developed at the time or that could develop 
in the future if the incident were to leave lasting effects on 
the secretary general's health. According to reports leaked at 
the time, a number of the NIF leaders raised the issue of 
forming a collective leadership to fill the void during 
al-Turabi's presence in the hospital for treatment and to 
replace him in case he disappears or becomes unable to work. It 
was reported that the names proposed to form that leadership 
were those of NIF Deputy Secretary General 'Ali 'Uthman Muhammad 
Taha, Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahman, Ibrahim al-Sinusi, Yasin 'Umar 
al-Imam, and 'Uthman Khalid Mudawi. But the proposal was 
rejected by 'Ali 'Uthman, who insisted that the adoption of such 
a step could produce adverse results and reflect the regime as a 
regime experiencing void or weakness because of al-Turabi's 
absence. 
  'Ali 'Uthman's argument did not convince the NIF's "old 
generation" who saw that 'Uthman was trying to gain sole control 
of the decisionmaking and to succeed al-Turabi "even while he is 
still alive." The feelings of annoyance among the ranks of the 
"old generation" began to appear in what this generation's men 
said in their private sessions. Some of them talked about 
endeavors by 'Ali 'Uthman to marginalize others and about 
'Uthman's efforts to gain control of affairs and to impose his 
tendencies on the NIF and on the regime. 
  It is to be noted that the majority of the Sudanese speak of 
'Ali 'Uthman as the planning head behind the 30 June 1989 coup 
and as the real director of numerous domestic affairs, 
especially since al-Turabi is inclined to devote a large part of 
his time to working and planning with the other movements 
connected with the NIF in the region. It has been noticed that 
since the assault on al-Turabi, 'Ali 'Uthman has begun to figure 
more prominently in the political arena, has begun to assume 
ministerial positions, and has begun to expand his powers and to 
enlarge the sphere of his influence by giving positions to the 
Front's "young generation" and by marginalizing the "old 
generation" that can dispute his leadership of the NIF action. 
  Even though al-Turabi has begun to exercise his leadership 
tasks since his return and, to a large degree, his recovery, 
some sort of division of roles has surfaced between him and 'Ali 
'Uthman, with al-Turabi devoting most of his attention and time 
to the foreign movement and contacts and to coordination with 
other fundamentalist movements through the facade of the Islamic 
Arab Popular Conference. Meanwhile, 'Ali 'Uthman takes charge of 
domestic executive action, with the role of grand "master" and 
guide maintained by al-Turabi in the domestic arena as well. 
  Many in the NIF and outside it realize that it will be 
difficult for 'Uthman to fill the void created in case al-Turabi 
disappears. This is because 'Uthman lacks al-Turabi's long 
experience and his extensive network of foreign relations. 
'Uthman is not even known to many beyond Sudan's border, and 
some view him as more of a political figure than a religious 
leader. 
  This is why NIF cohesion and unity seem to be tied to 
al-Turabi and to the extent of his ability to overcome the 
effects of the Ottawa incident, especially in light of the 
growing crises and pressures confronting the Sudanese regime 
internally and externally.

  [Text] Dr. Hasan al-Turabi was assaulted at Ottawa Airport 
on the evening of 25 May 1992. According to witnesses, al-Turabi 
received one or two blows to the head by a karate expert. 
Consequently, he fell down and his head collided with the 
ground, causing him to lose consciousness for 15-20 minutes. 
  Al-Turabi arrived at the Civic Hospital's emergency section 
at 1935. He was breathing normally, and his pulse and blood 
pressure were stable and within normal range. 
  There was blood in the nostrils, the upper lip was swollen, 
and there was a wound on the right rear side of the head. But no 
operation was needed to stitch the wound. 
  His eyes opened automatically, and he responded to verbal 
directions most of the time. But his verbal responses were not 
logical. Despite this, he showed no sign of weakness at the time. 
  A sectional brain scan showed a concussion in the front left 
side and temple. But the examination showed no blockage at the 
base of the skull, excluding a slight swelling in the left 
section of the skull. 
  Treatment with dexamethasone was initiated and Dr. al-Turabi 
spent the night of his hospital admission in the intensive care 
unit. On the following day (26 May), he was transferred to the 
neurosurgery ward. Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin visited Dr. al-Turabi on 27 
May at the request of al-Turabi's family. Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin 
suggested that al-Turabi be treated with minitol and phenytoin. 
  Repeated brain scans showed signs of a broader concussion 
than shown initially by the preliminary tests. It also became 
evident that there was great accumulation of fluids. It further 
became manifestly clear that the patient had lost the ability to 
speak. 
  On 28 May, Dr. al-Turabi seemed to be extremely exhausted 
and 
sleepy and totally unable to speak. Moreover, he was breathing 
haltingly. (A test of carbon dioxide pressure in the blood 
showed a reading of 47 TUR (measuring unit). He was readmitted 
to the intensive care unit and hooked to intravenous tubes and a 
breathing machine. His condition remained stable until the tube 
leading to the lungs through the trachea was removed. This was 
followed by a weakness of 4/5 degrees on the right side and 
total loss of speech. 
  On 2 June, al-Turabi was taken out of the intensive care 
unit. On 4 June, a rash appeared on his skin, and it was 
attributed to an allergic reaction to the drug dilantin. 
Consequently, it was decided to treat him with 250 milligrams of 
valboric acid three times daily. His treatment with minitol was 
suspended, the dosage of dexamethasone was reduced, and feeding 
by tube was resumed. 
  After this, al-Turabi was able to take a few steps in his 
room and could urinate without help from anybody. He also 
regained his ability to understand verbal directions, along with 
the ability to read and write. This was on 13 June. He also 
became able to feed himself. 
  The treatment with valboric acid may continue for six 
months. 
It is likely that a degree of the inability to comprehend and a 
large degree of the inability to speak will persist in a manner 
that cannot be determined by the preliminary tests. If his 
family agrees, Dr. al-Turabi can be helped to regain his fitness 
in a special unit, either in the United States or in Europe. 
This can be done on his way back to his country or shortly after 
he arrives in Sudan. I personally prefer that he be treated at a 
European center.

<F P=106> [Report by Yo'av Limor and Tamar Golan, correspondents to </F>
London and Paris] 
  [Text] A Tunisian Jew who currently resides in London has 
claimed that "thirty eight Jews were murdered in Tunisia 
following the Hebron massacre." According to him, the murders 
were perpetrated over the past two weeks, taking place in 
several cities throughout the country, and were not interrelated. 
  The man, who wished to remain unnamed for fear for his 
family 
which still lives in Tunisia, said that after the Hebron 
massacre, large demonstrations were staged in Tunisia. The 
demonstrators carried signs in which Jews were warned not to 
leave their houses. "We will kill anyone who leaves his house," 
some of the signs read. Others read: "No Jew will come out alive 
from Tunisia." 
  The source further said that many Jews dress up as Arabs in 
order to go shopping. "They do not want this story published; 
it could make their situation even worse," he said. According 
to him, Jews may have also been murdered in Libya, but the 
Jewish community there is not interested in making this story 
public. 
  Jewish sources in Tunisia denied the report that Jews were 
murdered altogether. 
  Leon Matzliah, the secretary general of the supreme 
religious 
body of the French Jewry, spoke with Jewish residents of Tunis 
last night. "I checked this story with senior members of the 
Jewish community in Tunis," he said, "and they said that they do 
not know that any harm was caused to Jews in that country. They 
were absolutely calm." 
  An Arab source in Tunis told MA'ARIV that this story is 
"hostile propaganda." "Such mass murder could never be kept 
secret," he said.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim </F>
al- Bid by Amin Muhammad Amin in Aden; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid has 
warned that there is a plan being implemented against the Arab 
nation to spread terrorism and extremism, undermine the Arab and 
Islamic nation's aspirations, and isolate it from the world. In 
an interview with AL-AHRAM, he said that this terrorist plan has 
clear features and is targeted against Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, 
Sudan, Yemen, and other Arab states. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Bid said: We cannot allow Yemen to be a way station for 
exporting terrorism to Egypt, because this hurts us and runs 
counter to our loyalty to Egypt. It is illogical for us to 
offer terrorism instead of loyalty. 
  All the plots and sedition being concocted against the Arab 
nation are also directed at the Islamic nation. In Yemen we are 
suffering from this terrorist plan opposing unity. We 
discovered in time that there are several terrorist acts and 
assassinations aimed at jeopardizing the march of unity. 
Therefore, it was necessary to adopt a stand against terrorism 
and those who support it, to protect the Arab nation's unity and 
solidarity, and to find a logical formula to confront this plan. 
  The secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
said that the Gulf crisis was another factor that affected the 
unity of Yemen. 
  He wondered about the reasons for the success of some 
fundamentalist calls and terrorist acts. He said that this 
success is the result of the existence of basic unresolved 
problems in some societies. These terrorist elements exploit 
such situations. They also exploit the youths who are suffering 
from a moral void and the absence of a pan-Arab concept to cling 
to. He clarified that despite this, the fundamentalist formula 
advocating terrorism under the slogan of the true Islamic 
religion -- which in fact has nothing to do with them -- did not 
gather momentum by itself. The Afghan experiment does not apply 
in the Arab world. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Bid concluded his remarks to AL-AHRAM by saying: Some al- 
Jihad members are in Yemen. I regret that some people are 
dealing with these terrorists and encouraging them. Details 
will become known in due time. This cooperation with the 
terrorists does not serve our cause or honor it. The main 
terrorist camp is found in Sa'dah in the north. The terrorists 
also began to assemble in the south but we are able to pursue 
these terrorists pockets and expose them. However, we find it 
totally unacceptable that the terrorists should enjoy the 
support of some people in power and some Army units. When they 
are left without official support, it will be easy to besiege 
them and get rid of them.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel in Russian at 1800 GMT on 19 March, during its regular 
"Novosti" newscast, carries a 2-minute report over video by 
correspondent Mais Mamedov on the Baku metro blast. 
  Mamedov begins the report from Baku, over video of people 
entering a metro station, by saying that the capital was 
particularly busy today because people were preparing for 
tomorrow's Muslim festival. At 1355 hours local time, as a 
train drew into the 20 January station, there was a powerful 
explosion in the front carriage. Following clips of the mangled 
wreckage, pools of blood, and rescue workers on the station 
platform, Mamedov interviews Baku City Procurator Adil Agayev, 
identified by caption, next to the wrecked train. Agayev says a 
powerful explosive device was planted in the train and adds: 
"And all these deeds that have taken place recently in the city 
of Baku demonstrate that a group of saboteurs is permanently 
operating in Baku. According to preliminary information, 
according to the testimony of witnesses, it is evident that 
there was a suspicious individual in the carriage where the 
explosion occurred today. We have been given a description of 
him and an identikit picture is being built up of him to 
establish his identity in the city." 
  In the studio, the announcer adds that according to the 
latest preliminary figures, 12 people died and 53 were injured 
in the blast.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, March 19 (AFP) -- At least 12 people 
were killed and 61 others injured, eight seriously, in an 
explosion Saturday in a crowded subway station in Baku, 
Azerbaijani authorities reported. 
  Fuad Akhundov, a presidential spokesman contacted by AFP, 
said that the explosion was caused by a delayed-action bomb. 
  The blast ripped through two coaches of a train in the 
January 20 subway station, the Azerbaijani news agency 
ASSA-IRADA said. First the head wagon, then the second 
exploded, both being engulfed by fire, it said. 
  "According to all probabilities, it was the Armenians," 
Akhundov said. 
  Azerbaijani troops have been fighting a six-year war against 
Armenian separatists from Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory 
populated mostly by Armenians but controlled by Baku. 
  More than 20,000 people have been killed in the fighting 
since 1988 and the Armenians were widely seen in Baku as likely 
perpetrators of any bombing. 
  However, no explosive device had been discovered by Saturday 
evening to back the bomb thesis. 
  A local journalist reached by phone said that about 100 
wounded people were evacuated from the station which was closed 
by police shortly after the blast. 
  Tensions have been running high in Baku, the Azerbaijani 
capital, in recent weeks after security forces began a crackdown 
against opposition forces supporting exiled former president 
Abulfaz Elchibey. 
  Several members of the Popular Front headed by Elchibey have 
been arrested and police have staged raids on the headquarters 
of the opposition party. 
  After the blast Saturday, Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev 
called an emergency meeting of internal security officials, but 
the outcome of the meeting was not immediately known. 
  The explosion occurred around 1:00 p.m. (0800 GMT) in the 
subway station located in the northern district of the city and 
named "January 20" after the 1990 crackdown in Azerbaijan by 
Soviet troops. [passage omitted] 
  Another explosion took place a month ago on a train coming 
into Azerbaijan from Russia, without causing any casualties. 
Responsibility for the explosion was not established.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 21, BNS -- A special group is already 
formed to prevent possible diversions against Russian army's 
strategic object -- Skrunda radar station, Latvian attorney 
general, Janis Skrastins, told Saturday [19 March] in his 
interview to Latvian radio. 
  A special sapper unit will also be stationed for a time in 
Kuldiga to immediately liquidate explosive devices if found any 
near Skrunda radar station. 
  The above mentioned actions were taken due to the blowing up 
of pole for high-tension power line in Feb. 28 near Skrunda 
radar and the explosive device found March 15 at a pole for 
electricity wires, situated 1 kilometer away from Skrunda radar 
station's pass post. [see item LD1603141994 in previous 
Terrorism Report] 
  Charges are brought against wrongdoers, and Latvian 
Prosecutors Office Board for Special Issues and Kuldiga district 
Prosecutors Office investigate both cases. Presently it is not 
clear if both the incidents are connected. 
  During the examination of clock mechanism that was connected 
to the explosive device found March 15, experts stated that the 
organizators of the explosion were non-professionals. The 
experts claim the device was made of 12 kilograms of tolite, 
electric detonator, wires, clock mechanism and power supplying 
battery. If it had exploded, not only near located houses but 
also Skrunda radar station would have suffered damages. 
  In return, it is stated that nearly half a kilogram of 
tolite 
caused the explosion in February 28.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Burlakov, chief of </F>
the department for combating terrorism at the Ukrainian Security 
Service Administration, by unidentified UKRAYINA MOLODA 
correspondent; place and date not given: "Terrorism Will Not 
Pass" -- first paragraph is UKRAYINA MOLODA introduction] 
  [Text] As indicated by its name, the main purpose of the 
Administration for Protection of National Statehood and 
Combating Terrorism and all relevant subunits of local 
governments is to detect and investigate crimes of a terrorist 
nature. This is why the administration and the local "T" units, 
in conjunction with other law enforcement agencies, the 
Ukrainian State Border Committee, and customs services, 
undertake operational actions to prevent illegal imports and the 
spreading of firearms and ammunition on Ukrainian territory. 
They reveal illegal pressuring of state and government 
officials, such as explosion, arson, and other methods, and 
conduct operational searches for authors and disseminators of 
anonymous documents containing evidence of plotting and criminal 
activities, whose investigation rests with the Ukrainian 
Security Service [SBU]. Those subunits are also in charge of 
counterintelligence tasks to counter anti-Ukrainian subversive 
terrorist actions. 
  Correspondent: How acute is the issue of terrorism 
in Ukraine? 
  Burlakov: Fortunately, no activities of 
organizations resorting to what is typically considered as a 
terrorist act in their political or religious struggle were 
reported in Ukraine. However, a kindling ground for this is now 
being cultivated in the state, abetted by the flawed legislation 
and the ever increasing legal nihilism on the part of both 
specific individuals and entire public groups. In 1993, 172 
cases of terrorist threats and attempts on the lives of 
government officials, deputies, and judges were reported, 
compared to 110 in 1992. Attempts by criminals and ultraradical 
individuals to acquire firearms, ammunition, and explosives, 
with which 762 aggravated crimes were committed, became very 
frequent. Given the danger to society posed by illegal 
possession of firearms and ammunition as well as their possible 
use in staging terrorist acts and other crimes, the SBU and the 
Interior Affairs Ministry [MVS] conducted several joint 
operations in 1993 resulting in the seizure of 1351 units of 
firearms, including 79 grenade launchers, 10 machine guns, 111 
assault guns, 103 rifles, 451 hand pistols, 2517 grenades -- a 
substantial increase since last year. 
  Correspondent: Could you give examples of specific 
cases that were successful? 
  Burlakov: Last year in January, agents from our 
administration, in conjunction with the SBU Chief 
Administration, foiled a conspiracy by one of the Middle East 
terrorist organizations to prepare in Ukraine a terrorist act 
against a foreign embassy based in Moscow. As a result, we 
confiscated grenades and explosives. We also prevented another 
foreign terrorist organization from purchasing in Ukraine 
equipment for conducting terrorist acts in other regions of the 
world. We have some evidence that due to its poorly patroled 
borders and some other factors, international terrorism has 
already "zeroed in" on Ukraine. 
  In late 1992, much attention was attracted by the case of V. 
Yukhno, deputy of the Kherson City Council and head of the 
Ukrainian Democratic Party Kherson-based organizations, who was 
severely beaten by unidentified individuals, and died in the 
hospital on 1 December, 1992. Some media and public 
organizations, prior to completion of the investigation, 
classified this tragedy as a terrorist act, accusing government 
institutions, the SBU, and MVS of inaction. Some even went as 
far as to suggest that law enforcement agencies abetted 
perpetrators of that murder. A special commission that included 
experienced agents from the Internal Affairs Administration and 
the Security Service Administration in Kherson Oblast was 
established to investigate the case. As a result of the 
commission's investigation, the culprits were found. They were 
adolescents aged 16 to 17, who had committed more than 10 
assaults and robberies. Two of them were convicted. The 
version claiming political reasons behind that crime, which was 
examined by our employees in great detail, was not borne out by 
the investigation. 
  In September 1993, the Internal Affairs Administration in 
Vinnytsya and Kharkov Oblasts along with the militia detected 
and broke up a criminal group that included residents of the 
above oblasts, as well as residents of the Dniester region. We 
confiscated 1,000 "F-1" grenades, 59 grenade launchers, 2 trotyl 
cartridges, 32 smoke pots, 100 electric detonators, 10 signal 
pistols, and 6 meters of safety fuse -- all stolen some time ago 
from warehouses of the 14th Army of the Russian Federation. 
  Last year, we found in Pervomaysk, Dniepropetrovsk Oblast, 
the authors, manufacturers, and distributors -- all local 
residents -- of leaflets containing provocative and threatening 
statements that were sent to the City Council chairman. It 
turned out that they were motivated by personal animosity toward 
the above official. 
  Also established were authors of anonymous letters sent to 
deputies V. Chornovil. O. Moroz, V. Ismalkov, S. Ostroushchenko, 
and others. 
  Correspondent: What organizations or groups in 
Ukraine pose the greatest threat of terrorism? 
  Burlakov: Today, such a threat is posed by 
attempts on the part of some ultraradical members of the 
Ukrainian National Self Defense, who do not rule out violence in 
their struggle for power. This organization sends its activists 
to fight in conflict zones (the Dniester region, Georgia). Over 
the past year, 4 units of firearms, 14 grenades, 10 explosive 
devices, and some 400 cartridges were confiscated from them. 
One should not write off criminal groupings and certain 
so-called defensive formations, used to prepare and carry out 
terrorist actions and other aggravated crimes, as well as 
emissaries of international terrorist organizations. 
  Correspondent: What obstacles do you encounter in 
fighting terrorism at present? 
  Burlakov: Of course, difficulties in building a 
new Ukrainian state affect the formation of profoundly different 
organs from the former KGB and other security agencies. Our 
administration, as the SBU as a whole, are in the process of 
organization. This causes problems hindering our antiterrorist 
measures. Cadre is the most important thing. Our 
administration is currently staffed only at 59 percent. Of 
those, two thirds do not have sufficient operational experience. 
The organization is poorly equipped, especially with computers. 
In addition, current legislation calls for particular 
improvement of Article 58 of the Criminal Code "Attempt at the 
Life of State Officials." We are talking about combating 
terrorism, but the state failed to come up with its concept of 
such a fight. There is even no legal definition of what the 
meaning of "terror" or "terrorist acts" in the Criminal Code are. 
  In spite of all those difficulties, we work to overcome them 
and believe in the success of our work.

Constitution [BfV], the extremist Kurds of the banned Workers 
Party of Kurdistan (PKK) receive massive help from the terrorist 
Red Army Faction (RAF). In an interview with AUGSBURGER

financial, logistical, and personal assistance from RAF 
sympathizers, maybe also from the commando echelon." There have 
been several "solidarity actions" for the PKK by the RAF scene, 
Frisch said.

  [Text] In case of hostilities, Turkish agents, who move 
freely in the areas controlled by the state, will act as a fifth 
column and attempt to attack and damage military and other 
installations with the aim of causing confusion and panic among 
the legal government and the Greek Cypriots. 
  For a long time, the security authorities have had 
information about hostilities, and these have been reinforced 
with Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' murder. However, the authorities 
cannot make any arrests due to lack of evidence. They simply 
observe the moves and activities of people who are acting as 
spies against the Republic of Cyprus. 
  Intense activity by Turkish agents has been noted in the 
past 
two months and cause concern to the police who are studying the 
issue at various conferences. 
  The Turkish agents reportedly enter the free areas through 
the British bases sometime during the night and they contact 
various people who live in the free areas.

  [Excerpts] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis 
condemned the murder of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, chairman of the 
Committee of Solidarity with Kurdistan, adding that he probably 
fell victim to Turkish Security Service agents. In a statement 
to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, Kasoulidhis said: We 
should not consider Yeoryiadhis' murder to have anything in 
particular to do with Cyprus. Such murders, Kasoulidhis added, 
have been taking place lately in various European countries and 
elsewhere. But, he said, if the aim was to affect the talks on 
the Cyprus issue, [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas will not 
avoid assuming his responsibilities on the talks on the 
confidence-building measures. [passage omitted] 
  DISI [Democratic Rally] General Secretary Dhimitrios 
Sillouris said Turks perpetrated Yeoryiadhis' murder. He said 
he is certain this is not the last such act we will see, adding 
that it must be organized, something directly connected with the 
advance of the confidence-building measures. Sillouris said 
Turkish agents circulate unhampered in the free areas of the 
Republic of Cyprus and added that we should all assume our 
responsibilities and protect ourselves through the state 
structure and through cooperation between people and the 
responsible authorities. [passage omitted] 
  The National Liberation Front of Kurdistan has strongly 
condemned Yeoryiadhis' murder, which, it says in a statement, 
was planned by the Turkish National Security Council and 
executed by the Turkish Secret Service. The statement also 
notes that the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan will reply 
accordingly to the Attila state, which destroys the people of 
Kurdistan with Ottoman and Mongolian methods.

are looking for a man of 30-35 who was seen leaving the scene at 
high speed aboard a small motorcycle of the Vespa type. 
According to the police announcement, this man is well built 
with short black hair and was wearing a dark sports jacket and 
dark trousers. [passage omitted] 
  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the police

offices for information on the whereabouts of Thoukidhidhou

also said that police will publish a sketch of the person within 
the day. [passage omitted] 
  The government spokesman said Yeoryiadhis' murder is part of 
the Turkish secret services actions that aim to hurt the 
movement for Kurdistan. He also said it cannot be ruled out 
that another aim of the murder is to hurt the talks on the 
Cyprus issue. Responding to a question, Kasoulidhis said 
Yeoryiadhis' murder affects the climate of the talks. [passage

  [Text] Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, the head of the Greek Cypriot 
Public Information Office [PIO] Turkish Department, was shot and 
killed outside his house at midnight last night. Yeoryiadhis, 
37, was fired on by two people on motorbikes. He was hit five 
times in various parts of his body, including his head, and he 
died on the spot. 
  Greek television network ET-1 and Greek Cypriot television 
networks Logos and Antenna dropped their regular programming to 
report the incident. They reported at 0130 that Greek Cypriot 
officials were at the scene investigating the incident. 
  As well as heading the Greek Cypriot PIO Turkish Department, 
Yeoryiadhis chaired the Greek Cypriot Committee of Solidarity 
with Kurdistan. He had direct links with the terrorist Kurdish 
Workers Party [PKK]. He visited the PKK camps in the al-Biqa' 
valley on various occasions and coordinated the campaigns 
organized in south Cyprus to support the PKK. 
  Theofilos Yeoryiadhis was known as a fanatical enemy of the 
Turks.

  [Excerpt] The Cyprus Committee of Solidarity With Kurdistan 
revealed that in the past Theofilos Yeoryiadhis received many 
telephone calls from people speaking Turkish who threatened to 
kill him. It was also revealed that, according to information 
at the committee's disposal, one of the next possible targets of 
Turkish secret agents is former National Guard Commander 
Lieutenant General Dhimitrios Matafias, who is considered to 
play a leading role in Greek activities in support of the Kurds. 
The committee has briefed the Greek police about this 
information. 
  These revelations were made by members of the Committee of 
Solidarity With Kurdistan at a news conference this afternoon on 
the abominable assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis. The news 
conference was given in the House of Representatives building in 
the presence of representatives from all the parliamentary 
parties, which condemned the assassination and praised the 
personality of the fighter for human rights, Theofilos 
Yeoryiadhis. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The perpetrator of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' 
horrible murder was a professional hit man acting according to a 
careful plan for which he needed much accurate information. 
This is the result of the Criminal Investigation Department's 
investigations so far and it reinforces the belief that Turkey's 
secret agencies planned the murder some time ago. 
  The culprit used a semi-automatic gun or a small automatic 
gun using special technology. The Criminal Investigation 
Department is convinced that if the culprit has not escaped to 
the occupied areas, he could be located and arrested. But the 
hit man could have crossed the buffer zone five minutes after 
the murder. According to the same reports, the culprits could 
have escaped to the occupied areas even with a car. This 
afternoon, the police are expected to release the sketches of 
two people who were seen moving in a suspicious manner in a 
yellow Mercedes a few hours before the murder. The description 
of one of the men matches eyewitness descriptions of the man 
they saw approach and shoot Theofilos from a Vespa motorcycle. 
[passage omitted on background material] 
  In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, 
Former 
National Guard Chief Dhimitrios Matafias confirmed that several 
Turkish press reports list him as a target of Turkey's secret 
services. Matafias reportedly met the Kurdish movement's 
leadership eight years ago and since then has supported the 
Kurds both financially and in other ways. 
  Commenting on information that he will be the next Turkish 
target, Matafias said he believes the Turks use these methods to 
intimidate or make an impression and thus strangle every voice 
in support of the Kurds. He added that he must take some 
additional protection measures.

  [Excerpt] Nicosia -- [passage omitted] Meanwhile, the 
Kurdish National Front has warned that it will "retaliate 
against the attack." In a statement in London, it said: "The 
murder was planned by the Turkish National Security Council and 
carried out by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization's 
agents." The front also claimed that it will definitely 
retaliate. 
<H5>  Yeoryiadhis Acted Like a Militant </H5>
  Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, who was known for coordinating PKK 
activities in south Cyprus, established the Committee of 
Solidarity With Kurdistan in 1988. As a Turkologist who spoke 
Turkish very well, he worked as a member of the Greek Cypriot 
secret service organization until he was appointed head of the 
PIO Turkish Department. 
  Yeoryiadhis visited the PKK camp in the al-Biqa' Valley 
together with several Greek Cypriot deputies in 1990. In a 
statement made in that camp, he claimed that the Kurds and the 
Greek Cypriots shared a similar fate. 
  As the head of the Committee of Solidarity With Kurdistan, 
Yeoryiadhis was invited to attend the PKK's activities in Europe 
as a "guest of honor." He leveled serious accusations against 
Turkey when he addressed the "Kurdish festivals" in Bochum and 
Frankfurt. 
  Yeoryiadhis organized campaigns on the Greek Cypriot side to 
support the PKK several times. He also opened bank accounts for 
donations to provide funds for the PKK. 
  Yeoryiadhis refused to be interviewed by the Turkish 
newspapers for a long time. However, he agreed to make a 
statement to HURRIYET in December 1993. Stelios Vervirakis, 
HURRIYET correspondent in Athens, interviewed him at the time. 
Some of the views he expressed were as follows: 
  1. The PKK will definitely destroy the Turkish State. 
  2. The Cyprus problem can be resolved only after the Turkish 
State is destroyed. Meanwhile, the Armenians will be relieved. 
  3. I have problems with the Cyprus Government because of my 
links to the PKK and other Kurdish organizations. The Turkish 
Cypriot newspapers have declared war against me. 
  4. A PKK camp does not exist in Cyprus. PKK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan has not visited the island. I would have been the first 
to be informed of his arrival. Turkish and Kurdish refugees 
cross from north Cyprus to south Cyprus. However, a provision 
on "refugee status" does not exist in south Cyprus. So, they 
are returned or dispatched to Syria or sent to prison. 
  5. Abdullah Ocalan is a great leader. He travels to 
wherever he wishes to go. He has fascinating capabilities. He 
is definitely not a stupid person. I can help anyone who wishes 
to talk to him, that is, if he agrees.

  [Text] It is possible that persons connected to a foreign 
delegation in Nicosia are behind the murder of Theofilos 
Yeoryiadhis, according to the chairman of the Committee for 
Solidarity with Kurdistan. 
  Investigators are examining this possibility as they 
evaluate 
specific evidence and information. These people previously 
stayed in a European capital and were expelled for their 
participation in terrorist acts. According to evidence and 
information passed on to the Cypriot authorities, these people 
acted on the instructions of the Turkish secret service. 
  As part of the investigation, police today searched houses 
of 
foreigners in Nicosia. Furthermore, police are examining 
yellow, left-hand drive Mercedes cars to see whether one is the 
automobile driven by a foreigner who was asking for information 
on Thoukidhidhou Street, where Yeoryiadhis' family lives. 
According to evidence and eyewitness descriptions, police are 
searching for a man between 30 and 35 years old who is 
apparently the perpetrator of the cold-blooded murder.

  [Text] Berlin/Karlsruhe -- The Berlin police searched the 
office of a journalist of the paper JUNGE WELT today. The 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed the operation, 
which is linked with the alleged letter by the Red Army Faction 
[RAF] published by the daily yesterday. [see item AU1603152294 
previous Terrorism Report] The spokesman of the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office, Public Prosecutor Hans Juergen Firster, 
stated that the search and the confiscation of the 18-page 
letter was ordered because the original of the letter may be 
used as evidence. With the help of technical examinations, 
"evidence may be obtained and evaluated" that might allow 
conclusions regarding the writer or the writers. 
  The operation is justified despite the journalists' right to 
refuse to give evidence because the drafting of the letter and 
its dispatch to the newspaper "suggest membership in the 
terrorist association RAF." Thus, just like other pieces of 
evidence, it is subject to confiscation, the spokesman stressed. 
  The editors of JUNGE WELT protested "most strongly against 
the measure of the federal authorities."

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "Warning of Islamic Attacks"] </F>
  [Excerpts] German security services have strengthened their 
protection of Jewish and Israeli facilities in the Federal 
Republic. 
  The reason for this is the massacre of more than 30 Arabs by 
a Jewish settler in Hebron. [passage omitted] 
  The Office for the Protection of the Constitution has 
produced an analysis warning the federation and the laender of a 
"medium to long-term increased risk to security in Germany." 
  The analysis says that "because the terror potential is 
incalculable and arbitrary, attacks by opponents to the 
PLO-Israeli agreement could spread beyond the region at any 
time, possibly to Germany as well." 
  Therefore in Western Europe there is a particular danger of 
"spontaneous actions by fanatical lone-wolves from the Islamic 
region." This also applies to the Federal Republic where, 
according to the experts in the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, violent actions by "irrational individuals" are 
also to be expected in the short term. 
  Jewish and Israeli facilities are considered primary targets 
for such actions. But, says the analysis, the Islamic 
organizations active in Germany, the ones most expected to carry 
out acts of violence, still do not have the necessary 
infrastructure to carry out a rapid and organized strike. 
  According to the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, there are some 1,640 supporters of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and Shi'ite extremist 
Party of God (Hizballah) active in Germany. Just like the 
dissident organizations that oppose the PLO, these groups want 
to revert to an armed struggle with Israel.

  [Text] Rome, 21 Mar (ANSA) -- The hijacker was later 
identified as Giuseppe Cizio, 67. He was reported as warning 
that no one should approach the plane, and reiterating his 
demand to talk to the press. 
  Two members of the Carabinieri police and one of the Italian 
police force were reported as being on the passenger list. 
  The plane was surrounded, at a safe distance, by large 
numbers of Carabinieri and other police, as well as 50 or so 
firemen. 
  Cizio was reported to be brandishing a package he said 
contained a hand grenade; talking with police and Meridiana 
officials on the plane radio, he is believed to have declared 
his intention to publicise an "injustice" he received in a 
recent judicial inquiry. 
  Cizio has a record of petty crime including burglary and 
"verbally assaulting a public official". 
  Rome police chief Fernando Masone was reportedly on his way 
to the airport.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the </F>
Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, by an unidentified correspondent; 
date not given -- the correspondent is based in Cologne but 
Ocalan's whereabouts are not specified] 
  [Text] Correspondent: Your party issued a 
statement on this year's Nevroz celebrations. You said: 
"Nevroz will be celebrated in homes." What concrete measures 
will be taken in this direction. 
  Ocalan: Most probably, people will be called upon 
to stay at home during the day. They should light fires and 
gather at night. They could also fire guns if that poses no 
danger. The guerrillas too might carry out particular 
operations. This too is a form of celebration. Besides, it is 
not our position that "there must necessarily be a major 
explosion" on Nevruz. For us, every day is Nevruz. For us, 
Nevruz is disciplined, tactical work. We are not trying to turn 
particular days into days of special demonstrations. There are 
drawbacks in that. People must show understanding of our 
position, which aims at preventing massacres. A few massacres 
were committed when an effort was made to mark 1 May [Workers 
Day] as a tradition in Turkey. Our decision is a precaution. 
That is how it should be seen. But the activities of the 
guerrillas will continue. 
  Correspondent: Tansu Ciller made a statement in 
connection with Nevruz. She said: "We were late this year but 
next year Nevruz will be declared a national holiday." The SHP 
[Social Democrat Populist Party] and MHP [Nationalist Movement 
Party] supported this proposal. What is the motive behind this 
proposal? 
  Ocalan: [Motherland Party leader] Mesut Yilmaz 
said: "It is an election bribe." Apparently, this assessment 
is near the truth. I do not think it came from a serious thought 
or as a sign of a new process. The elections are nearing and 
she needs votes. It might have been made with this in mind. 
  Correspondent: There will be local elections a 
week after Nevruz. The DEP [Democracy Party] announced that it 
will have no part in these elections. How would you assess 
those who are trying to get the votes that would have gone to 
the DEP? 
  Ocalan: There are interesting developments in this 
regard. The DEP has vote-winning potential, on the basis of 
which a game is being played. In particular, [SHP leader and 
Deputy Prime Minister] Murat Karayalcin is engaged in a ploy. 
After the DEP's elimination from the elections, he is trying to 
use its vote-winning potential. His statement that "we were 
thinking of legalizing Nevruz but it did not happen; next year 
it will be legalized" was partly made to win DEP votes. There 
are already reports that the immunity of DEP members was lifted 
to prevent them from participating in the elections. It was 
linked with speculation on votes. The SHP is acting with 
duplicity on this issue. It supported a parliamentary 
commission decision on lifting immunity. And, like Fehmi Isiklar 
and Feridun Yazar, he is using some Kurds as mediators to win 
over the Kurdish voters. They are creating particular lobbies 
to secure these votes for the SHP. While they ask for capital 
punishment for those who want to remain a bit honest and 
patriotic, they also ask for votes for the SHP, which passed the 
execution order. This is duplicity and a dangerous game. We 
will surely use our right to reply. If they are honest, they 
should make their position against this warning clear. But it 
is not admissible that they should first intimidate, jail, and 
provoke people and then appear in the role of a guardian angel 
and become part of the game. This is a dangerous path. We warn 
its authors. We will not lower ourselves to the extent of 
becoming tools in this game. Such an election game does exist. 
  Correspondent: Could we learn from you personally 
the PKK's position on these elections? 
  Ocalan: Ours is an active boycott of the 
elections. Anyway, in our view there is a war, not elections. 
They [the Turkish authorities] will never allow an election to 
be held. They have already taken measures. They have gathered 
the ballot boxes in villages under the control of village 
guards. The special warfare units will allow no democratic 
voting. They will do everything to rig the results in their 
favor. There is no sense in becoming a tool in such an 
election. We cannot concede to such a game. We will spoil this 
election deception that they have organized. I think the DEP 
too understood this reality, that is, contrary to some claims, 
the DEP did not withdraw from elections on "Apo's [alias for 
Abdullah Ocalan] instructions." Rather, DEP people knew very 
well that they [the Turkish authorities] would not have allowed 
them to get elected. They [the Turkish authorities] took all 
the necessary measures. 
  We are witnessing an open massacre of democratic people, the 
denial of every election right. We know the candidates that 
will now take the DEP's place. Take Cizre: Some 95 percent of 
the town's population is made up of patriots and democrats. But 
the RP [Welfare Party] is trying to get Karno, the head of 300 
village guards, elected as mayor. Karno has always been a 
village guard chieftain and has served in the most dangerous 
special warfare teams. He is not the head of a town but of a 
counter guerrilla team. He is a target. He became an RP 
member. That too was a tactic. They [the Turkish authorities] 
want to strengthen the RP in Kurdistan. This is being done in 
accordance with a decision made by the General Staff. We will 
eliminate any candidate, be he from the SHP or any other party, 
and particularly if he is a candidate from the RP, who wants to 
get the DEP's votes. Since they have set out to expel us from 
the elections and massacre us -- massacres have indeed happened 
-- we will use our right to resist. I am warning such people. 
Don't let them say later: "We did not hear" or "We have been 
given unduly severe punishment." It is clear which side was 
first to inflict severe punishment. 
  We supported some of the people in the Turkish Parliament 
who 
might have been the real voice of the people. They were not PKK 
members. Despite that, we supported them for their attachment 
to the people and for hoping that they would speak out about 
particular demands from the rostrum. We expected nothing more 
from them. Considering that they are being suppressed and put on 
trial on charges of treason, we will use the same language 
against those who will supplant them. We are calling on such 
people not to become tools in this game. We don't want them to 
become tools, be it under the guise of the RP or SHP. We are 
strong. They must know that as our strength increases, they 
will be severely punished. This is the way we are entering the 
election period. We will employ the policy of preventing and 
boycotting the elections as much as our strength allows.

  [Text] Batman, Mar. 24 (A.A.) -- A group of terrorists 
abducted the nephew of a mayoral candidate in southeastern 
Turkey on Wednesday. 
  The Anatolian News Agency learned that a group of terrorists 
arrived in Bekirhan, Batman late last night and abducted 
Kutbettin Demir the nephew of True Path Party (DYP) mayoral 
candidate Yahya Demir. 
  Faik Demir, another nephew of Yahya Demir, was also 
kidnapped 
by terrorists a while ago. 
  Last month, the separatist terrorist organization PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] threatened violence in the 
southeast leading up to the local elections after the Democracy 
Party (DEP) announced that it was not contesting for the March 
27 local elections. DEP also called on its constituents to not 
participate in the elections.

  [Excerpts] KURD-A/Botan -- Noting that this year Nevruz's 
active resistance will be mostly executed by the guerrillas, the 
PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] called on the people not to go into 
the streets, refrain from going to work, and celebrate Nevruz in 
their homes. The PKK indicated that mass and radical activities 
could also be held where conditions permit, but such activities 
must only be held with the support of ERNK [National Liberation 
Front of Kurdistan] and ARGK [People's Liberation Army of 
Kurdistan]. 
  A statement signed by the PKK Central Committee and 
distributed in Kurdistan noted that Nevruz, which has centuries 
of tradition in uprisings, is now being celebrated by the 
Kurdish people under new conditions. The statement noted that 
Nevruz played a historic role in protecting the national 
existence in Kurdistan and, particularly in recent years, it has 
become a means of resurgence of the national liberation struggle 
under the guidance of PKK. 
  Noting that "1994 Nevruz is being welcomed by endeavors to 
freely reconstitute our country" and that the present stage is 
one of securing a political and military balance between the 
state and the PKK, the PKK statement says: "In some parts of 
our country this balance has been achieved and many areas are 
under the control of our armed forces. The Turkish Republic's 
political authority was considerably eroded with the recent 
decision to boycott the elections. As a result of heavy 
losses, particularly in 1993 and the winter months, the Turkish 
Army has gradually retreated into the cities. The PKK has 
started to create free areas and administrations in places 
cleared of Turkey's fascist Army. Parallel with efforts to 
develop active warfare against the enemy, work is going ahead on 
setting up a National Assembly and provincial assemblies, 
electing leaders, and forming a war economy as a foundation for 
a people's regime." [passage omitted] 
  Pointing out that the 1994 Nevruz is being marked under very 
different circumstances, the statement says: "Nevruz, which is 
historically the source of our freedom and strength and which 
fulfilled its appropriate role every year with the blood of 
hundreds of martyrs, will also play its deserving role this 
year, on which we have pinned great hopes, and will glorify the 
resurgence in 1994. Nevruz will again be celebrated with all the 
splendor. This year Nevruz's independence and freedom fire will 
enlighten our cities and mountains. Our people will welcome 
Nevruz with the excitement and joy of the gradual establishment 
of the people's rule in Kurdistan. But Nevruz will be celebrated 
differently this year. This year's Nevruz celebrations will be 
in the form of a Kurdistan-wide mass protest of the massacres, 
violence, village torchings, and antidemocratic actions 
committed by the Turkish Republic through special warfare and 
stealthy methods. The fascist colonialism -- which is torching 
our country without restraint, refuses to recognize any of our 
national-democratic rights, and prefers to resort to bloodshed 
-- will be countered by a wide-scale protest action. 
  "In accordance with our party's decision, on Nevruz everyone 
should dress in national customs and mark our historic holiday 
in their homes, not go into the streets, and not open shops. As 
in every other year, the freedom fires should be lighted on 
Nevruz night; with the sunrise no one should appear in the 
streets but instead celebrate Nevruz at home. The 1994 Nevruz 
celebrations should, in general, be in this form of mass 
protest, but where conditions allow it could be celebrated in 
the form of radical mass actions. However, such celebrations 
should be held under ERNK guidance and with the knowledge of the 
guerrilla force. On the war front, the guerrillas with the 
greater potential will launch even more comprehensive attacks 
against the enemy forces during this Nevruz and will not allow 
the treacherous circles to soil our sacred Nevruz. It will be 
the guerrilla force that will primarily execute the active 
resistance this Nevruz; the Nevruz resistance will resurge all 
over Kurdistan with guerrilla activities that will be further 
developed and expanded during the week of heroism to follow the 
Nevruz holiday. The 1994 Nevruz will be marked in such an 
appropriate manner on both fronts [civilian and military] and it 
will be made to play its historical role in harmony with the 
stage attained by our national liberation struggle."

  [Text] The Greeks have created opportunities for militants 
of the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] to carry out their activities 
in Greece. They have also provided funds for the PKK and 
supported that organization in the international domain. Many 
Greeks participated in the rally the PKK militants organized in 
Germany for "Freedom to Kurdistan" and carried banners of the 
Greek Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK]. They chanted 
slogans against Turkey, which they described as the "common 
enemy." 
  Meanwhile, it is common knowledge that the Greeks facilitate 
efforts by PKK militants to escape from Turkey through the Greek 
islands in the Aegean Sea. 
  It will be recalled that several Greek deputies and generals 
visited PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in the al-Biqa' Valley some 
time ago. They informed him that they will give every kind of 
support to PKK's "justified" struggle against Turkey. 
Meanwhile, the Greeks are trying to establish a radio for the 
PKK in Greece. The PKK radio will be in an area close to the 
Turkish border and will broadcast on the FM band. Furthermore, 
they have allowed the PKK to open an office in central Athens. 
  It has been reported that relations between the Greek 
Cypriot 
side and the PKK go far beyond the visit of Greek Cypriot 
deputies to PKK camps and the opening of a PKK base in south 
Cyprus. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs contacted the 
Colt [as published] firm some time ago to convey the serial 
numbers of M-16 rifles the Turkish security forces impounded 
from PKK militants and ask for information on the country that 
purchased them from that firm. The officials responded by 
disclosing that the rifles in question were sold to south Cyprus.

1980 military coup, has recently been attracting a lot of 
attention with its activities in the Southeast in the run up to 
the local elections on March 27. Political observers say that 
there is renewed energy in the party ranks and its mayoral 
candidates are conducting a very successful campaign with the 
assistance and support of the security forces in the region. 
They say that the MHP is being used as a shield against the 
terrorist activities of the PKK (outlawed Kurdistan Workers' 
Party) in the Southeast. Observers predict that successful MHP 
candidates at the local elections will be open targets for the 
PKK. 
  Opinion polls show that the MHP will do very well in the 27 
March mayoral elections in at least two provinces and a number 
of districts and townships in the Southeast. MHP candidates for 
Sirnak and Bingol provinces are regarded as certain to win and 
party officials have intensified their campaign for Diyarbakir, 
the biggest province in the region. 
  Political observers say that MHP campaigns in the region 
have 
the active support of the security forces and make the 
observation that MHP candidates are protected by the security 
forces, consisting of police, special teams, village guards and 
the clans who support the government. Furthermore, these groups 
are able to convey the MHP's message to sections of the 
community which are out of reach of the political parties. 
Military personnel are not involved in the campaign but some 
are reported to be encouraging people to vote for the MHP. 
Observers also point out that the turnout of voters in the 
region will be relatively low and this will benefit the MHP. 
They believe that those who had intended to vote for the 
Democracy Party (DEP) will not vote for any other party now that 
the DEP has withdrawn from the elections. Many voters take the 
threats by the PKK very seriously and will not risk voting for 
another party. Voters will also experience difficulties in 
reaching polling stations due to unfavorable weather conditions. 
Added to this is the number of people who have moved away from 
the area since they were registered on the electoral roll. 
  These factors will result in a low turnout which will be to 
the MHP's advantage. 
  Based on the belief that MHP supporters are actively engaged 
in warfare with PKK terrorists, commentators say that the MHP 
and its young nationalist members are being set up for a bloody 
confrontation with the PKK. 
  Chairman of MHP, Alpaslan Turkes, is reported to have said 
that his party was very reluctant to have anything to do with an 
outlawed group such as the PKK which worked against the state. 
Turkes also said that it was the government's responsibility to 
take the necessary measures otherwise any act by the MHP might 
be regarded as provocation. 
  Observers also believe that the supporters of the MHP are 
inadvertently pushing the party into the eye of the storm, into 
open clashes with PKK terrorists. 
  "Let us assume that MHP candidates are successful in some of 
the provinces" observers say, "The PKK will definitely kill 
these candidates, even though there is no active anti-PKK 
campaign in the region. They will owe their success to the 
support of the armed forces once they are elected. 
  In the event that the PKK does kill the MHP candidates, not 
only will they succeed in causing havoc in the region, they will 
draw the members of the MHP into the centre of the Kurdish 
problem. 
  The irony of the situation is that the PKK will finally set 
the MHP against itself even though the MHP has always succeeded 
in avoiding a confrontation with the PKK." 
  The MHP is well known for its willingness to be actively 
involved in the Azeri-Armenian and Bosnian conflicts, but does 
not want to have any dealings with the PKK. 
  They may not be able to avoid the consequences of the recent 
political developments in the region.

Guido Olimpio in Italy; date not given: "Turkey: Six Kurdish 
Deputies May Face Capital Punishment" -- first two paragraphs

published] 
  [Excerpts] Olimpio: What do you think of the 
upcoming local elections? 
  Toguc: If these had been free elections, we would 
have supported them wholeheartedly. However, in order to 
prevent us from taking part in the vote, the state has attacked 
the DEP. Dozens of activists have been arrested, bombs have 
been planted in the various parties' headquarters, and 
candidates have been intimidated. This is why the DEP has 
decided not to take part in the elections, and has requested the 
people to abstain. [Toguc ends] 
  An even harder line was adopted by the PKK, which warned 
candidates not to stand in the elections: "Those who do not 
obey this order will pay a high price," came the message. The 
resistance's dictate was accompanied by a diplomatic offensive 
which led PKK leader Abdullah Farhat's [name as received; 
presumably Abdallah Ocalan] brother Farhat Ocalan to Moscow. 
According to Lebanese sources, Farhat was received by head of 
foreign counterintelligence Primakov, who promised to provide 
support and weapons.

  [Text] Ankara -- Reliable Kurdish sources in the Middle 
East reported this week that outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party 
(PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan had moved out of Syria and was 
currently in Lachin, a part of Azerbaijan which is currently 
under Armenian control and also inhabited by Kurds. 
  The sources said Ocalan had travelled to Lachin earlier this 
month from his residence in the town of al-Qardahah in Syria's 
Latakia province. The PKK leader had been living for nearly a 
decade in Damascus and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's hometown 
of al-Qardahah. 
  According to information received by the TDN, [TURKISH DAILY 
NEES] Ocalan is currently in contact both with Armenian 
officials and influential Kurdish circles in Lachin. 
  They said that he aims to establish a major training base in 
the Lachin corridor, which connects Nagorno-Karabakh with 
Armenia, opened by the Armenians in 1992 and since then the main 
artery supplying the enclave from Armenia. 
  The exact date of Ocalan's travel to Lachin was not made 
clear, although it has been confirmed that he was outside Syria 
earlier this month when Iraqi Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani 
visited that country. 
  Despite Turkish press reports that Talabani had contacted 
Ocalan and was seeking to press him for a new cease-fire, 
sources said the PUK [Patriotic Union of Kurdistan] leader -- 
who also travelled to al-Qardahah -- did not find him there. 
Talabani has denied the reports saying he had no contact with 
Ocalan. In a meeting he held with Turkish gendarmerie 
commanders last week near the Iraqi border, Talabani informed 
Turkey of this as well. 
  The sources, who usually know of Ocalan's whereabouts, told 
the TDN on Thursday that there was also speculation that the PKK 
leader had recently travelled to Russia. 
  Once the camp in Lachin is set up, they said, there could be 
more terrorist activity in eastern Turkey. 
  The PKK has in the past denied Ocalan's previous trips 
outside Syria. 
  The PKK's European representative and Ocalan's political 
advisor, Kani Yilmaz, said in January that he would even meet 
the press but no journalist has seen Ocalan for the past seven 
months.

  [Text] Ankara, March 19 (AFP) -- A grenade attack against 
the local offices of a Turkish government coalition party left 
17 wounded in Diyarbakir, in the mainly Kurdish south-east of 
the country, police said Saturday. 
  One of the two men responsible was arrested after the attack 
Friday evening on the offices of the Social Democratic Populist 
Party, they said. 
  No one has claimed responsibility but police attribute the 
attack to the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which 
has called for a boycott of next Saturday's local elections and 
threatened reprisals against participants. 
  Offices of the centre-right True Path party, a coalition 
partner, and the opposition Motherland Party have also been 
attacked and a candidate of the centre-left Republican People's 
Party was killed Thursday in nearby Kayapinar by unknown 
assailants. 
  More than 10,000 people have been killed since the PKK in 
1984 launched its armed struggle to take the southeastern region 
out of Turkey.

  [Excerpts] Ankara, Mar. 18 (A.A.) -- State Security Court 
Chief Prosecutor Nusret Demiral said today that recordings of 
tapped phones of the separatist terrorist organization show that 
the illegal organization has formed a political flank in 
parliament. 
  Demiral, together with Ankara Security Director Orhan 
Tasanlar, showed to journalists, the room where six deputies, 
who were arrested a day before, had stayed and the room in which 
they were interrogated. [passage omitted] 
  Demiral said that the deputies were questioned on violating 
Provision 125 of the Penal Code. 
  `Under Provision 125, crimes against the state do not 
necessarily have to be armed attacks,' Demiral said. `The 
illegal organization has a political flank and a military flank.' 
  Demiral refuted the claim of DEP defense attorneys that all 
party telephones were tapped. 
  `This is not true,' he said. `Those that were tapped are the 
ones that were used to communicate with PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] head Abdullah Ocalan and the organization's members.'

<F P=106> [Report by Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Excerpts] The extraordinary skill and courage of an Army 
helicopter crew shot down by the IRA in Northern Ireland came in 
for high praise today. The Lynx helicopter was hit in the tail 
and disabled by a Mark 15 mortar bomb as it hovered 100-feet 
above the security force base at Crossmaglen in south Armagh. 
Yet with supreme skill the crew managed to crash land the 
aircraft inside the base -- avoiding private housing nearby. 
They baled out in the dark during the terrifying incident on 
Saturday night -- then went back to the helicopter as it began 
to turn into a fireball. Despite their own injuries, they 
rescued a seriously injured policeman who had been travelling 
with them. Seconds later the helicopter exploded, sending a 
fireball shooting into the sky. 
  At a press conference in Co Armagh today, RUC [Royal Ulster 
Constabulary] Deputy Assistant Chief Constable Bill McCreesh 
said that but for the skill and professionalism displayed by the 
pilot and helicopter crew there could have been a major tragedy. 
And he furiously condemned the IRA mortar attack on the 
helicopter, launched over a residential area, as "lunacy". 
  Although the helicopter was badly damaged, the pilot managed 
to land it within the security force base. "Had it come down in 
the town itself many lives would have been put at risk," he 
said. The mortar had been fired from the town square 150 yards 
across local property into the base, he added. 
  It was the first time a mortar had been used to down a 
helicopter and investigating officers were uncertain whether it 
or the base was the target. There have a series of mortar bomb 
attacks on the heavily-fortified joint Army and police border 
station. 
  He slammed the IRA for an indiscrimate, reckless and 
ruthless 
attack which could have had horrendous consequences and again 
displayed the terrorists' utter lack of human and Christian 
feeling. 
  "This mortar attack was not just an attack on an Army 
helicopter but on the complete community of Crossmaglen. For 
any bomber to launch a mortar from, and over, a residential 
area, is a complete act of lunacy," said Mr McCreesh. [passage 
omitted] 
  Local MP Seamus Mallon (Newry and Armagh) launched a verbal 
broadside on Sinn Fein and the IRA for carrying out the attack 
when they were spending their time talking about peace. The 
Social and Democratic Party deputy leader said: "I am very 
angry. God knows how many people could have been killed in that 
attack -- thankfully they weren't." He said Northern Ireland 
had gone back to the syndrome "where we have Sinn Fein and their 
spokesmen talking peace in the morning and carrying out these 
murderous attacks through the IRA in the evening". 
  "I think that is what is revolting many people within this 
country," Mr Mallon declared. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Berlin, March 21 (AFP) -- The German government has 
demanded Syria extradite the terrorist "Carlos" and a 
collaborator, both wanted in connection with a 1983 attack in 
then West Berlin. 
  Earlier requests by the German ambassador in Damascus had so 
far been met with "partly irritated and partly negative" 
responses from the Syrian authorities, Hartmut Hilldenberg of 
the German foreign ministry said Monday [21 March]. 
  He is a witness to a court hearing dealing with the 1983 
attack on the French cultural centre in West Berlin, Maison de 
France, in which one person died and 23 were injured. 
  The Syrians have denied involvement in the incident. 
However, a Syrian diplomat admitted that Damascus supported the 
Carlos group in the early 1980s. German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel met his Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Chareh, in Bonn 
Thursday to express the German demands for the extradition of 
Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias Carlos and his German associate 
Johannes Weinrich. 
  Investigators believe those who carried out the attack 
wanted 
to free another one of Carlos' associates, a German woman named 
Magdalena Kopp. In 1982 she was sentenced to four years 
imprisonment in France for possessing explosives.

  [Text] Sydney, March 19 (AFP) -- Greek religious leaders 
held a special mass here Saturday after their orthodox church 
was set on fire amid ethnic tensions between Greek and 
Macedonian communities. 
  Firefighters were called late Friday to St Efimia's Greek 
Orthodox Church in the western Sydney suburb of Bankstown, 
within Prime Minister Paul Keating's constituency. 
  The front double doors were ablaze and police said a 
four-litre can which might have contained fuel was discovered 
outside. A police spokesman said it was too early to say 
whether it was linked to the Greek-Macedonian tensions. 
  Earlier this month, a Greek community centre [see previous 
Terrorism Report] and the offices of a state MP, Alex 
Andrianopoulos, were firebombed in Melbourne following 
Australia's recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Macedonia on February 15. 
  Greece insists that the use of the term, "Macedonia", 
applies 
only to a northern Greek province of the same name and has 
accused authorities in the former Yugoslav republic of 
harbouring territorial designs on Greek territory. 
  Macedonians have also complained that the Australian 
government caved in to Greek lobbying when it decided on Monday 
to refer to them officially as Slav Macedonians. 
  There are about 700,000 Greek Australians -- a large 
majority 
of whom live in Melbourne -- with about 25,000 of them having 
roots in Macedonia.

  [Text] Yola, March 18, (NAN) -- The Adamawa Government has 
alerted the citizens of the state about a fictitious document 
capable of inciting the public to cause disorder being 
circulated by an unknown group. A statement signed by the 
secretary to the government, Alhaji Umaru Dewa, said that the 
security agencies had found the pamphlets being circulated 
within the state to be fake. The statement said that while the 
origin of the publication was being investigated, the public 
should disregard its content and any similar leaflets that might 
preach chaos and disaffection among the people. It urged 
religious leaders of all faiths to prevail on their followers to 
be calm and go about their lawful business. NAN gathered that 
the leaflets, purported to have been written by an unknown group 
called Islamic Jihad International Organisation of Nigeria" [no 
opening quotation mark as received] had expressed 
dissatisfaction with some appointments and activities of the 
state government. In the publication the group threatened to 
attack some government edifices as well as places of worship to 
register its grievances.

  [Excerpts] Six incidents involving explosive devices have 
been recorded this month and all, with the exception of the 
foiled attack supposedly on the Israeli Embassy last week, were 
intended to undermine government stability, Interior Minister 
Chawalit Yongchaiyut said yesterday. 
  "The incidents that took place can be divided into two 
categories. The first involves people wanting to put political 
pressure on the government, while those responsible for the 
second category are terrorists," Chawalit said at a press 
conference after a 90-minute meeting with senior police officers. 
  Chawalit said the March 3 grenade assault on Social Action 
leader Montri Phongphanit's home, the March 8 bomb attack on a 
train in Songkhla's Chana district, the March 9 grenade attack 
on Deputy Permanent Secretary for Interior Sawai Phramani, the 
March 13 grenade attack on the Nakhon Phanom governor's 
residence and the March 20 blast in downtown Hat Yai in Songkhla 
province fell into the first category. [passage omitted] 
  But he claimed the attacks carried out by disaffected 
political elements with the aim of destabilizing the government 
were not of national significance. 
  "For example, the grenade attack in Nakhon Phanom (at the 
provincial governor's home) may be a mistake on the part of the 
assailants," he said. 
  "Acts of terrorism usually intensify and eventually lead to 
armed struggle, which is exactly what happened in our country in 
the past," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hat Yai, Songkhla -- A time bomb exploded yesterday 
afternoon in bustling downtown Hat Yai, in Songkhla province, 
injuring four Malaysia tourists and three Thais, police said. 
  Police said it was fortunate that they learned of the bomb's 
existence 15 minutes before it went off. They managed to clear 
most people away from the area. 
  The injured, who were standing or walking several metres 
away 
from the bomb, were only slightly hurt about the legs by the 
blast and nails included in the explosive device, police said. 
  Two policemen and private security officers were among the 
injured. 
  Police said it was too soon to determine any connection 
between the explosion to the discovery in Bangkok of a "truck 
bomb" allegedly intended to explode at the Israeli Embassy. 
  The Hat Yai bomb, stuffed inside a plastic bag like those 
used to hold grain, was left in front of a leather shop on the 
Nipat Uthis 3 Road, the town's main shopping spot. 
  The shop owner, Wilawan Sae Ung, noticed that the bag had 
been left unattended for too long and alerted police at 4 pm. 
She tried to make a phone call, but the line was busy so she 
ran to a traffic policeman in the area. 
  Sgt. Bunsoem Thongmai opened the bag and found a bomb wired 
to a clock. Hundreds of nails were also found in the bag. He 
immediately called for reinforcements and alerted bomb-disposal 
experts. 
  While some policemen were clearing the crowd away from the 
area it went off at 5:30 pm, before the arrival of disposal 
experts. 
  Boonsoem and Pol Sgt. Suchin Chet-Urai were knocked down by 
the blast, along with the four Malaysian tourists. The injured 
received treatment at Hat Yai Hospital and were discharged. 
  The blast left a hole 30 cm in diameter and about 18 cm 
deep. 
It scattered leather goods inside the shop as well as books 
inside a nearby bookstore. Some books were blown more than 
seven metres away. 
  The windshield of nearby car was also smashed and nails 
damaged one side of a parked pick-up truck. 
  Hat Yai police chief Pol Lt Col Khamronwit Thupkrachang said 
the bomb was made of dynamite and had a destructive radius of 
seven to eight metres. He said it seemed that the assailants 
wanted to "create a disturbance" rather than cause much 
destruction. 
  No one had claimed responsibility for the bomb. 
  But Pol Lt Gen Michai Nukunkit, assistant police director 
general in charge of the southern provinces claimed police knew 
the identities of the people behind the explosion. Police had 
made sketches of suspects from accounts given by the shop owner 
and other witnesses. 
  Stepped-up security had been ordered for major business 
areas 
in the town, including the railway station and bus terminal. He 
said there could be further attacks. 
  Following the blast, sniffer dogs and disposal experts were 
sent in to comb the area for more bombs, but nothing was found. 
The search continued until 9 pm as hundreds of onlookers 
gathered nearby to observe.

  [Excerpts] Senior government officials said yesterday the 
bomb blast in Hat Yai on Sunday was not connected with the 
truck-bomb discovered in Bangkok last week. Meanwhile, senior 
police officials warned that bombings may become fashionable 
again, especially in the deep South. 
  Police stepped up strict security measures in public areas 
in 
Hat Yai and there were also security alerts in Pattani, Songkhla 
and Narathiwat said Pol Lt Gen Michai Nukunkhit, assistant 
police chief overseeing the southern region. 
  More than 10 department stores in Hat Yai sought police 
protection yesterday. Police commandos patrolled the town's 
airport and conducted a bomb disposal rehearsal. 
  Most shoppers shunned the normally bustling main shopping 
spot where the blast injured seven people Sunday. Sawai Na 
Phatthalung, chairman of Songkhla's tourism business 
association, said the bomb "has the biggest impact" on Hat Yai's 
tourism. 
  "It's worrisome that planting a bomb in a crowded public 
area 
may become fashionable again," said Pol Lt Gen Michai. 
  A letter purportedly from the Pattani Liberation United 
Organization (Pulo) was found yesterday in Hat Yai, claiming 
responsibility for the downtown bomb attack. 
  Hat Yai police chief Pol Lt Col Khamronwit Thupkhrachang 
said 
the group called in the letter for the immediate release of four 
arson suspects arrested for having allegedly set fire to 
southern schools in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat in August last 
year. 
  The letter, written in the southern Yawi dialect, was found 
inserted in the door of a car parked 20 metres from the blast 
site. It was handed over to police by the car's owner, 
Khamronwit said. 
  The letter said the Pulo was not responsible for the arson 
attacks on the schools. 
  "The group said it had no cause to attack the schools 
because 
Muslim children also studied there," the Hat Yai police chief 
said. 
  On Sunday, two helicopter gunships and a command helicopter 
made four raids on a separatist gathering on Yala's Kudong Hill. 
The operation will continue for five to seven days. 
  Provincial bomb experts said ammonium nitrate and diesel oil 
were believed to be components of the Hat Yai bomb. [passage 
omitted] 
  Army Commander in Chief Wimon Wongwanit said yesterday 
terrorism has become frequent in Thailand, probably because "we 
are too friendly to tourists". 
  Wimon said the "friendliness", which stemmed from the need 
to 
promote tourism is resulting in security loopholes. "We 
undoubtedly are good hosts. But this has provided a loophole 
for foreigners with ill intentions to create trouble in our 
country."

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A team of Metropolitan Police 
searched a shophouse in Bang Kapi where they found another steel 
water tank, 25 sacks of fertilizer, electrical wiring and 50 
other items believed used in assembling the bomb. 
  Police said the investigators were led to the three-story 
shophouse by a water tank shop on Ramkhamhaeng Road whose 
address was on the side of the bomb found on board a rented 
truck in front of the Lumphini Police Station on Thursday. 
[passage omitted] 
  Police said they questioned staff at the water tank shop who 
confirmed they had delivered two tanks to a house on Sukhaphiban 
Road at the order of a foreign buyer. 
  Police said they found a receipt which showed the fertilizer 
had been ordered from a shop in Thon Buri. 
  The shop had been rented to a Mideast-looking man who spoke 
Thai about four months ago, police said. 
  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said 
investigators have identified the Mideast-looking man who drove 
the truck and rented the shophouse. 
  He said the man had rented the house since August last year 
and had transferred money to the house owner to pay for the rent 
from a province in the South. 
  Interpol has already been contacted to look for the man who 
might have left the country, he said. 
  Up to four foreigners lived in the house, he said, but the 
landlord believed they had now left Thailand. 
  Pol. [Police] Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said, based on the contents 
and materials used to make the bomb and the items found 
yesterday at the house, police and intelligence agencies decided 
the terrorists belonged to the same group which exploded a bomb 
at the World Trade Center in New York. 
  The bomb used at the World Trade Center on February 26 last 
year was said to be made of the same concoction known among U.S. 
Federation Bureau of Investigation agents as a "witches' brew". 
[passage omitted] 
  Chaiyasit said he was "50 percent" sure the terrorists are 
still in the Kingdom. [passage omitted] 
  He said the information given by the owner of the truck, the 
water tank shop staff and the motorcyclist indicates the 
Mideast-looking man who rented the truck and bought the water 
tanks was the same person. 
  The man communicated with his hands and spoke both English 
and Arabic. 
  Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said he was confident there was more 
than one, probably three to four, people involved in the plot 
and they would have had to have been in the country for some 
time because the person who drove the truck appeared to know 
Bangkok's roads. 
  Police Director-General Pratin Santipraphop said he believed 
at least two Mideast-looking men were involved in an 
international plot to blow up the Israeli Embassy. 
  But the names of the two suspects are still unknown and it 
is 
not sure if they are still in Thailand, he said. 
  Pol. Gen. Pratin. said police yesterday searched several 
areas of Bang Mot and Ramkhamhaeng in search of the suspects. 
[passage omitted] 
  A Syrian tourist, Mohammad Hazamail, 35, was detained at his 
rented room at Phetchaburi Apartment yesterday by Immigration 
police and taken immediately to Lumphini police station for 
questioning and identification by the motorcyclist. 
  The man was released later after being cleared. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The Defense Ministry is trying to trace the source 
of the ammonium nitrate which made up part of an extremely 
powerful suicide-bomb found in the back of a truck in Bangkok on 
Thursday. 
  Ammonium nitrate is a colorless, crystalline salt used 
chiefly in explosives and fertilizers. 
  Sources at the Defense Ministry said it is classified as a 
"military logistical item" and its distribution is restricted by 
law. All purchases and shipments of ammonium nitrate must be 
made through the ministry's Industry and Energy Center. 
  "The center is trying to trace the source of the one ton of 
the substance found as part of the explosive device in the 
foiled bombing attack believed directed at the Israeli 
diplomatic mission," one of the sources said. 
  The sources said the person who assembled the bomb must have 
bought the chemical from authorized users registered with the 
Industry and Energy Center. 
  Buyers of ammonium nitrate must prove they are in the 
rock-blasting business or produce fertilizers, as well as have a 
license to possess and use explosives from the Interior Ministry. 
  There are about 20 merchants licensed to sell the compound 
in 
Thailand, the sources said. 
  Under the law governing military supply, illegal possession 
and use of ammonium nitrate is punishable by a maximum prison 
term of five years and/or a fine of up to Bt50,000. Using the 
fertilizer to make an explosive device is liable to punishment 
under the law on firearms and explosives. 
  One of the sources said the explosive mixture found on the 
truck -- C-4 explosive, diesel oil and ammonium nitrate, known 
as "witches' brew" -- would not be very effective if detonated 
in the open. 
  "If detonated in an open space there would be very loud 
blast 
and not much else," the source said. "But the bomb would be 
devastating if set off in an enclosed area, inside a building."

  [Excerpts] The foreign terrorists who assembled the 
truck-bomb discovered on Thursday probably had Thai allies, 
Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut said yesterday. 
  His admission coincided with a police announcement that a 
warrant will be issued tomorrow for the arrest of a suspected 
international terrorist, and that other warrants may follow. 
  Police said at least four people collaborated in assembling 
the truckbomb. 
  It was likely Thais were involved since it was difficult for 
foreigners to buy all the components locally. 
  "I have learned that some Thais joined the gang. The 
crackdown must be made at their grassroots," Chavalit said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Police yesterday produced a sketch of a second suspect in 
the 
sabotage attempt. An artist's sketch of the first suspect, 
drawn from details given by the owner of the motorcycle hit by 
the truck, had already been sent to all police stations. 
  Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen, Thawi 
Thippharat yesterday said the two suspects are from the Middle 
East, but he would not specify their nationality. [passage 
omitted] 
  He said police had lifted fingerprints from the Bung Kum 
house and they should be useful in identifying the terrorists 
and their organization. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Officials of a U.S. antiterrorist unit reportedly 
will come to investigate the explosives and sabotage preparation 
methods to see which group might be responsible for the bombing. 
Investigators have focused their attention on the Muslim fanatic 
group which calls itself "Jihad" or militant Muslim groups which 
have been long-standing enemies of Israel. 
  According to a report, in 1992 members of these groups 
detonated a bomb laden truck which they parked in front of the 
Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 20 instantly and 
wounding 240 others. This method is similar to the one planned 
for Thailand. The C-4 explosives used in that explosion are the 
same type that were found in the tank on the six-wheel truck in 
Bangkok on 17 March. 
  The method and type of explosive, in addition to support 
from 
terrorist groups seeking the separation of southern Thailand, 
led police to focus on the above mentioned groups. This theory 
matches the investigation result which shows that part of the 
financial support came from Sungai Kolok District, Narathiwat 
Province. Also, there must be support from residents in 
Thailand to facilitate travel by the suspects in the country. 
  The Metropolitan Police investigation team's questioning of 
witnesses reportedly resulted in naming four suspects: Mr. 
Wudera Wankuwa, Mr. Konsak Ayat Manusuk, Mr. Mohamad Talao, and 
Mr. Asmal Dansis Hakare. The Immigration Office has been asked 
to check the arrival and departure records of these people.

  [Excerpts] One of three fugitive terrorists wanted by the 
United States for the explosion at the World Trade Center in New 
York was believed to have been involved in the foiled bomb 
attack against the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok last week, 
according a police source. 
  The highly-placed source identified the terrorist as Ramzi 
Ahmad Yousef, one of three terrorists who remain at large after 
allegedly carrying out the bomb attack on the World Trade Center 
on Feb 26 last year. 
  The source said pictures of Yousef had been distributed 
among 
police in Bangkok and the Muslim-majority provinces in the South 
where he was believed to be hiding. 
  He said apart from the Israeli diplomatic mission, possible 
targets of the terrorists responsible for the truckload of 
explosive materials uncovered by police last Thursday may have 
included the embassies of the United States and Turkey as well 
as foreign dignitaries in Bangkok. [passage omitted] 
  The source said Pattani is one place where international 
terrorists, most of them Shi'ite Muslims, can find a safe haven 
after committing crimes in other countries. 
  He said the terrorists travel on fake passports and get to 
Pattani via Malaysia. 
  Tourist districts in Bangkok frequented by visitors from the 
Middle East, such as Soi Nana and Saphan Kwai, are also hiding 
places for terrorists, the source said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] According to a source at the Police Department, 
on the night of 21 March there was an urgent message from the 
U.S. intelligence service to U.S. officials working with Thai 
police investigating a plot which involved a one-ton truck-load 
of explosives found on 17 March. The message said that the 
fugitive terrorists had not left the country but were still 
hiding in Thailand. It has also been found that the group has 
shifted their objective from the targeted embassy to 
assasination attempts against high-level officials of that same 
embassy. "Major targets are high- level officials of the U.S. 
and Israeli Embassies, as well as those at the Pakistani and 
some other embassies," the source said. 
  The source also revealed that U.S. and Thai intelligence 
authorities found that, on the day the terrorist abandoned the 
truck, he left a black James Bond briefcase on the truck. It is 
believed the briefcase contained some important documents. But 
the case disappeared during the time the truck was parked near 
the Lumphini police station. The Police Department and the 
Metropolitan Police Division have already set up a committee to 
investigate how the briefcase disappeared. [passage omitted] 
  There will be an increase in the number of security 
officials 
guarding residences of ambassadors as well as embassies, 
especially the Israeli and U.S. Embassies. The Thai police will 
maintain around-the-clock coordination with the U.S. 
intelligence service. 
  An officer of the Metropolitan Police in charge of security 
protection for important persons told newsmen that police 
officials had been assigned to guard important premises and 
residences of important persons, particularly foreign embassies. 
The Metropolitan Police will guard the outside areas of the 
compound whereas the Special Branch Police will provide security 
at the residences of ambassadors and foreign embassies.

  [Excerpts] Regarding the recent discovery of a bomb in 
Bangkok believed to be an operation of an international 
terrorism gang, Pratyathawi Tawethikun, deputy permanent 
secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs received information about it before 
the explosives were uncovered but no exact date, time, and place 
of operation were known. Therefore, it was difficult to prevent 
the incident. However, more preventive measures are now 
required for important places, while cooperation is being 
undertaken with various countries in preventing serious 
incidents, and good relations are to be maintained with Middle 
East countries. [passage omitted] 
  Police General Prathin Santipraphop, director general of the 
Police Department, said that the arrest of the culprits seems 
unlikely because it is believed they have already left of the 
country. However, cooperation has been sought with other 
countries that are expected to have a criminal background on the 
group of terrorists so that further police action can be taken 
to arrest them. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Police have asked four unidentified countries to 
check if sketches of two suspects in the "truck bomb" conspiracy 
look like anybody in their terrorist blacklists, police chief 
Prathin Santipraphop said yesterday. [passage omitted] 
  "I have sent the sketches of two suspects to four countries, 
which I can't name at the moment, in the hope they may know 
their identities," Prathin said. Those countries have official 
organizations which keep records of international terrorists, he 
added. [passage omitted] 
  Pratin said the large amount of fertilizer found in a truck 
abandoned by an Arab-looking man near the Israeli Embassy in 
March 11 after a minor accident was uria nitrate, not ammonium 
nitrate as previously reported. 
  "I've checked with foreign experts and it turns out the bomb 
does not have as much destructive power as we first thought," he 
said. 
  Meanwhile, a police source said one of the terrorists behind 
the conspiracy is believed to be among three men still at large 
after bombing the World Trade Centre in New York in February 
last year. 
  The source said Mir Aimal Kansi 30, is one of the three 
suspects. The combined rewards for information leading to his 
arrest in connection with the worst terrorist act on U.S. soil 
amounts to $2 million. 
  Police suspect this man was behind Bangkok's truck-bomb 
attack but that he fled the country through a border point in 
Songkhla province last week. 
  The source said officials at Sadao district, on the border 
with Malaysia, remembered a man "who looked like an Arab" 
crossing the frontier on March 15. They had photocopied his 
fake Pakistani passport. 
  The source said the picture in the passport looked like 
Kansi 
except that his haircut had been changed. 
  About 300 senior metropolitan police officers attended a 
special meeting yesterday on how to cope with saboteurs using 
explosives. The meeting at the metropolitan police headquarters 
was held because "metropolitan police have no knowledge about 
how to cope with suspicious objects or explosive materials," 
according to Pol Maj Gen Somchai Prapaspakdi, deputy Bangkok 
police chief.

  [Text] Two cars parked near the U.S. ambassador's residence 
in this capital caused concern among the police forces in charge 
of the security of U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The police bomb 
squad verified that both cases were false alarms. 
  The bomb squad acted a little after 0830 today when the 
police considered suspicious the presence of a Renault 18 pickup 
on Libertador Avenue with a flat tire. After a thorough check 
the police verified it was only a false alarm. A police 
tow-truck removed the car from near the ambassador's residence. 
  Soon afterward, the bomb squad returned to investigate a 
white Renault 12 parked on Libertador Avenue, 80 meters from the 
ambassador's residence and which had also called the attention 
of the police. After inspecting the car, the police verified 
that this was also a false alarm.

  [Text] Masked men who were accompanying National University 
Dean Fabio Castillo Figueroa seized Finance Ministry offices in 
Tres Torres and held employees hostage for several hours. The 
group of masked men, brandishing sticks and stones, positioned 
themselves at the Ministry gates and prevented people who were 
paying their taxes and making other transactions in the morning 
of 16 March from exiting. 
  Castillo Figueroa and a group of bullies entered the 
facilities in search of Finance Minister Edwin Sagrera to demand 
an increase in the the National University allotment, but 
Sagrera was not in his office at the time. The criminals said 
that they would stay in the area holding employees and private 
citizens hostage until the minister returned to discuss the 
problem. Many women feared that something serious was going to 
happen and fled through a small fence, leaving their purses and 
other possessions on the premises. 
  National Police riot officers moved to the site in order to 
protect public property. The police presence prompted the 
masked men to draw the weapons they had been hiding and begin 
provoking the officers, who were staying several meters away. 
  Several vehicles belonging to UN Observers for El Salvador 
members were parked at the main entrance as though to protect 
the masked men, who refused to let the employees and private 
citizens leave. 
  Castillo Figueroa told the officers: "There will not be any 
problems, we have control over the youths." Moments later the 
riot police left the site, and the masked men remained inside 
the building.

  [Excerpt] We have Ubaldo Diaz of the newspaper OVACIONES, 
from Tijuana. Go ahead Ubaldo. 
  Diaz: This afternoon at 1908 Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
presidential candidate for the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI], was the target of an attack. He 
apparently sustained two bullet wounds -- one in the head and 
one in the chest. The political rally was being held in the 
Lomas de Tijuana neighborhood, better known as Lomas Taurinas. 
Colosio was leading a political rally here for 3,000 persons. 
At the end of the rally, as he was leaving the podium, two 
individuals, a young person and an older one, approached him 
with pistols and managed to shoot the PRI candidate. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel Ye. Popov under the rubric </F>
"For High Combat Readiness": "Joint Strike"] 
  [Text] The economic crisis in our society cannot help but 
be reflected in the everyday activities of the army. We will be 
honest--the state of affairs in the ranks frequently reaches 
catastrophic in virtually all regions. The unsatisfactory 
logistical support is having a marked effect on the course of 
combat training for the air units in the Far East Military 
District as well, and naturally not in a positive sense. Many of 
the aviation commanders in the local areas thus have to rack 
their brains searching for ways out of the situation. They do 
find them, you know. By way of example, flight shifts have begun 
to be planned with the finely tuned orientation of each flight 
toward the comprehensive resolution of basic tasks of combat 
training, so as not to permit any further reductions in the 
professional qualifications of the pilots. The efficient use of 
simulators in particular is contributing to the cause of 
conserving material resources. People, that is to say, are not 
sitting with their arms folded waiting for suggestions from 
above, but are rather seeking out reserves themselves. But they 
understand that the maintenance of skills in the techniques of 
piloting alone is clearly insufficient to improve tactical 
flight proficiency--the principal aim of the martial labors of 
the aerial warriors. 
  This circumstance has obviously also prompted the officers 
of 
the detached air-assault air regiment to try and find 
non-standard solutions for these problems. There have been lots 
of proposals, but the most realizable--and ingeniously 
simple--one came from Deputy Commander Military Pilot 1st Class 
Lieutenant-Colonel V. Yeshmyakov. 
  Its essence consists of the following: to perform the tasks 
of tactical flight exercises [LTU] in conjunction with our 
neighbors, helicopter pilots, taking into account experience in 
the interaction of Su-25 aircraft and rotary-winged craft during 
the combat operations in Afghanistan. Valeriy's idea was then 
supported by everyone. The first results of the flights 
organized in the new fashion have confirmed its vitality. The 
LTU I wish to talk about became the logical continuation. 
  No, we were not able to accomplish everything planned right 
away. The fact is that, as with everything new, Yeshmyakov's 
idea required a considered approach and precise calculations in 
order to see that the undertaking itself was not discredited, 
and to prove its right to life. The first difficulties arose as 
early as in the stage of preparing for the LTU. That is 
understandable--there was nowhere to turn for experience or 
official documents for performing such exercises. The 
flight-control officers of the helicopter and attack-aircraft 
air regiments had to be trailblazers here. And they managed to 
do so, efficiently putting forth methodological recommendations, 
elaborations of variations for joint actions and calculations 
for the efficient application of forces. This was facilitated by 
the fact that many of them had completed the harsh schooling of 
Afghanistan. 
  What did they use as the basis of the calculations? First 
and 
foremost, the conclusions of military scholars, both domestic 
and foreign, seeking to prove the effectiveness of close 
interaction among diverse aviation forces. The capabilities of 
the Mi-24 crews to detect, identify and destroy armored targets 
on the battlefield, by way of comparison, are several times 
greater than the analogous ones for the Su-25 crews. The latter, 
however, are able to overcome the resistance of enemy PVO [air 
defenses] more successfully. It is thus not surprising that the 
results of modeling their joints operations showed that they are 
1.6--2.1 times more effective than autonomous operations, while 
the losses of the one and the other were reduced by 30--50 
percent. The required helicopter and attack-aircraft forces were 
20--30 percent lower in that case accordingly. 
  These data were also used to develop the plans for the 
impending exercises, namely the distribution of forces for the 
accomplishment of combat-training tasks. Comprehensive group 
exercises on LTU topics were devoted to clarifying them. All of 
the training had to be conducted on the ground, using simulator 
systems to the fullest extent, for understandable reasons. The 
pilots of both regiments realized very well how difficult the 
tasks facing them would be to accomplish, and were thus 
thoroughly prepared. 
  The IAS [aviation engineering service] specialists had their 
own concerns. Each technician experienced for himself that the 
less his aircraft flies, the greater the attention that must be 
devoted to it in servicing. The personnel, for all that, 
prepared the aircraft for the exercises very well. The standouts 
included aviation technical detachment commander Major G. 
Makukh, armaments engineer Captain V. Golub and servicing group 
chief Captain A. Nefedov. 
  Proper credit must also be given here to the specialists of 
the support services--Senior Sergeant A. Gusarov and Sergeants 
Ye. Stetsyuk and I. Khalilov, among others. The military 
collective of the air garrison, that is, was working at a 
uniform rhythm, united for a common aim--to achieve success. 
  The first to go up were helicopter pilots of the group 
commanded by Major N. Vasilyev. Understanding very well that the 
operations of the rest depended on the results of their work, 
each of the reconnaissance crews was in a combat frame of mind. 
Reaching the assigned area in concealed fashion, they carried 
out the search, transmitted the coordinates of targets detected, 
and identified and even designated the targets in the next pass. 
  The attack aircraft appeared behind them on the practice 
range. Leader Major A. Sirotin did not miss the opportunity to 
confirm his reputation as a leader; making use of all of the 
might of his on-board weaponry, he suppressed the fire of the 
"enemy" air defenses on the move. The wingmen supported the 
initiatives of the squadron commanders. A group of Mi-24 
helicopters rushed into the "overflight corridor" that had been 
formed. Could the helicopter pilots really let down their 
commander, Major A. Sobolev, with the LTU were being held on the 
eve of his birthday?! They deluged the tank targets with a sea 
of fire and smoke from the rockets on the first pass. 
  Then the attack aircraft were back in the sky. While 
excellent work on the practice range was the rule for Major S. 
Salnikov, Captains Yu. Zabudko and S. Esse--who had recently 
obtained their 1st class ratings--were pretty anxious before the 
sortie. But for no reason at all, judging by the results. 
Participation in the ground attack was for them yet another 
opportunity to verify for themselves their mastery under 
conditions that were as close to combat conditions as possible. 
  It is in just such a climate that you understand that common 
victory in a military action takes shape from the individual 
achievements of each soldier. That is how the successes of 
Captain I. Abdullayev's flight can be explained--there were two 
destroyed "enemy" artillery emplacements on the scorecard of his 
pilots in one pass. Such is the style of the new masters of 
weapons delivery. They were entrusted with putting the period to 
the end of the LTU. And they did not disappoint. 
  The tactical flight exercises are behind us now. I would say 
right off, first of all, that the work of the fliers on the 
practice range was assessed as excellent by the evaluators, and 
their smooth interaction in the air was noted in particular. The 
joint strike justified itself in every way--virtually all of the 
targets were destroyed, the evaluation of the system of command 
and control of the crews in the air was conducted successfully, 
and a high level of organization of aerial reconnaissance and 
search-and-rescue support was achieved. The hypothetical losses 
of the crews proved to be minimal as well. Second, a 
considerable economy of fuel and ammunition was also achieved in 
the LTU through the joint performance of analogous tasks using a 
reduced complement (on both sides). 
  But the aviators have not forgotten the results, and they 
have drawn conclusions and lessons for tomorrow. It also makes 
sense for others to think some about what can be 
undertaken--even on the scale of a single regiment--if one does 
not wait for something to turn up, and works creatively instead. 
And all that is because--and this is third--the people, yearning 
for the true business, finally found faith in themselves and 
felt the taste of victory. That is the moral achievement of a 
cohesive collective--the gaining of hope. 
  When this material had already been prepared for 
publication, 
I called Khabarovsk. It became clear from my conversation with a 
senior air officer that the policy of developing command 
independence, creativity in the accomplishment of 
combat-training tasks and the rejection of stereotypes among the 
attack-aircraft and helicopter pilots at garrison X was 
unchanged.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Yu. Timchenko, deputy chief of the LP </F>
[Flight Accidents] Investigation Directorate of the RF Armed 
Forces SBP [Flight Safety Service], under the rubric "Flight 
Safety: Special Situation": "Thirty Seconds in a Takeoff..."] 
  [Text] Many years of accident statistics demonstrate 
that the takeoff is one of the most unsafe stages of a flight. 
Gross errors in piloting and failures in aircraft hardware 
during it lead, as a rule, to grave flight accidents with the 
death of people. 
  The weather that day, as they say, was gorgeous. The crew of 
an Su-24--Senior Lieutenants I. Chizhenko and S. Dzhololov--were 
preparing to make a performance-graded flight as part of a pair. 
  Forty seconds after takeoff of the lead aircraft, the pilot 
brought the engine RPM to maximum, set the RUDs [engine control 
levers] to "Full Afterburner" and released the brake. A turning 
moment arose in the direction of the left engine during the 
takeoff run, which the pilot attempted to counter by deflecting 
the right pedal and using the brakes. He accomplished separation 
of the nose wheel at a speed of 180 km/hr. The angle of attack 
reached 15 therein (instead of the recommended 
10--12), while the deviation of the aircraft from the 
takeoff heading was 3 to the left. 
  The attempt of Chizhenko to kept the aircraft on the runway 
by deflecting the pedal and the stick by 2/3 of their full range 
was not successful. The deviation from the takeoff heading 
reached 13 before the separation of the aircraft, and the 
threat arose of its running off the runway. The pilot, seeing 
the inevitability of continuing the further run off of the 
artificial surface, set the pedal in a position that was close 
to neutral. 
  In the 20th second of the flight, after crossing the side 
safety strip, the aircraft separated at a speed of 290 km/hr 
with a left bank and angle of attack of 20.3. A second 
later the flight control officer and his assistant gave the 
command to the pilot to reduce the climb angle. As a consequence 
of the Su-24 entering a mode of neutral G-forces, the presence 
of slip, a sharp reduction in the effectiveness of the controls 
and the inaction of the pilot, there occurred a further increase 
in the angle of attack (more than 33) and left roll at an 
angular velocity of 10/second. 
  The flight operations officer [RP] twice gave the command to 
the crew to eject in the 25th second of the flight of the 
aircraft, at an altitude of 15 meters and a roll of 50. The 
aircraft hit the ground a distance of 400 meters from the runway 
axis in the 30th second with a left roll of 90, and the 
crew was killed... 
  What dangerous factors led to the appearance and development 
of this catastrophic situation? 
  The complication of the flight conditions occurred owing to 
the failure of the left engine afterburner to ignite, caused by 
a failure of the spark gap and gas rectifier of the ignition 
system. The crew, in order to keep the situation from 
disintegrating into an emergency, should have performed 
functional duties to monitor the operating mode of the power 
plant before the takeoff--and in this case turn off the 
afterburner mode of both engines, report the curtailment of 
takeoff to the RP and taxi to the hardstand. 
  Unfortunately, neither the pilot nor the navigator seems to 
have followed these rudimentary recommendations. The takeoff was 
continued, and the dangerous factor was not localized. 
  The pilot could have averted the disintegration of the 
situation into an emergency by fulfilling one of the following 
alternative conditions: 
  --the making of a timely decision to curtail the takeoff 
(there were four seconds of time reserve to assess the situation 
and make a decision, with the length of the takeoff run not 
exceeding 630 meters); 
  --the continuation of the takeoff with the maximum use of 
the 
controls to keep the aircraft on the runway, and error-free 
piloting with regard to the angle of attack. 
  The difference in thrust between the two engines when the 
afterburner on one of them was not operating was 4,700 kgf. 
Calculations and the results of flight testing have shown that 
it can be countered by the maximum deflection of the rudder. The 
reserve of flight mass at which gain in altitude in possible 
with one engine operating in full afterburner mode was 8,000 kg 
under the actual conditions of this takeoff. 
  There was also no help for the crew, when the deviations, 
arose on the part of the GRP [flight operations command and 
control group] specialists, since their capabilities for the 
continuous monitoring of the aircraft in the takeoff run are 
extremely limited owing to the positioning of the workstations 
at the command and control post; the command to reduce the angle 
of attack in takeoff was issued too late. 
  The emergency situation ensued at the moment of separation 
of 
the aircraft and its reaching of supercritical angles of attack, 
when it was now no longer possible to avert stalling by vigorous 
pushing of the stick. The sole correct decision of the crew 
under these conditions would have been to abandon the aircraft 
immediately. 
  The safe ejection zone, calculations have shown, was at the 
interval of 12--22 seconds. The emergency ejection gear could 
not save the crew starting at second 23--at a roll of 35 or 
more and a speed of 300 km/hour, the parachutes would have 
opened only at an altitude of 15 meters, which would not make it 
possible to lessen the speed of the "man--parachute" system to a 
speed that would be safe for survival. The crew's decision to 
eject was eight seconds late. 
  Statistics show that the reliability of engines in 
afterburner ignition is not adequate. There have been eleven 
such instances recorded in units where this flight accident has 
occurred over the last three years alone. 
  The unreliability of the pilot, which depends on more than 
his level of training alone, is the chief danger factor under 
conditions of a sharp reduction in flying time. A knowledge of 
the aerodynamic properties of the hardware being operated, a 
well thought-out and effective system of conducting training 
sessions with the practicing of skills for averting special 
cases in flight and, finally, personal monitoring both on the 
ground and in the air--these are the conditions for ensuring the 
personal safety of the pilot. 
  The short duration of the takeoff of a modern aircraft does 
not leave time for the assessment of the situation and the 
making of decisions; it requires immediate and competent 
actions. Therefore, increase attention toward the takeoff!

Colonel (Reserve) N. Zavgoroniy under the rubric "Military 
Reform and Higher Educational Institutions": "See the Future by 
Comprehending the Past"] 
  [Text] The reform of higher military schooling urgently 
requires a reconsideration of the attitude toward 
military-historical training (VIP) of cadets and enrolled 
personnel at Air Forces higher educational institutions. Its 
content and volume today do not fully conform to national and 
international norms; whence the low level of military-historical 
knowledge of matriculants at the academies, and the absence of 
any logical link between the academic teaching discipline of 
"The History of the Military Arts" and the curriculum of the 
schools in "Military History"; there is no center that would 
coordinate military-historical training in the Air Forces. The 
importance of VIP for the military cadres, and the consequences 
of underestimating the formation of a historical consciousness 
of the Air Forces among them, have unfortunately not yet been 
realized. 
  Moreover, the role of VIP for cadets and enrolled personnel 
in the system of higher military education is increasing. The 
military-historical disciplines, after all, are an important 
component of the operational-tactical, special and humanitarian 
training of military cadres. The creative assimilation of 
contemporary military arts is possible only based on the 
clarification of military-historical experience and its lessons 
and an understanding of overall principles and general laws, 
which not only stimulates professional training but also serves 
as the basis for the patriotic and moral indoctrination of 
officers and facilitates the formation of leadership qualities. 
  A natural question is, what must be done to bring the level 
of VIP at Air Forces higher educational institutions into 
conformity with the requirements of the times, with the nature, 
specific features and development prospects of the armed forces 
of the Russian Federation? 
  I will try to answer. 
  There are no doctors today among the cadre officers who are 
instructors in the military-historical disciplines at the Air 
Forces academies, and no candidates of historical sciences at 
the military schools. The training and retraining of cadres in 
the field of "Military History" must thus be improved first of 
all. Young and promising instructors who are candidates of 
historical sciences could be thus recommended for doctoral 
studies, and those who have no academic degree, especially at 
the schools, could enter graduate studies in the department of 
the history of the military arts of the VVAs [military aviation 
academies] for this purpose. It would be expedient to train 
military-history instructors for the academies, as well as to 
retrain them, based on the Military Academy of the General Staff. 
  The problem of the scarcity of historians at the Air Forces 
schools could be resolved first through training at the 
Retraining and Skills Enhancement Department of the Air Forces 
Academy imeni Yu.A. Gagarin. Their subsequent training is most 
expediently continued according to individual plans in the 
departments of tactics of the military aviation schools. 
  The future creation of a teaching group on the basis of the 
academy, oriented toward the training of military historians for 
the higher educational institutions, NIU, Air Forces Main Staff, 
newspapers and magazines would seem to make sense in the future. 
Young officers interested in military history from the ranks, as 
well as the enrolled personnel of the academy who recommend 
themselves through their participation in the work of the VNO 
[military-science society] circle in the department of the 
history of the military arts, could be brought in for training. 
  The name, purposes and content of the military-historical 
discipline being studied at the Air Forces schools of the RF 
must be clarified. It is called "Military History" today. 
Yesterday's grade-school pupils, however, are scarcely able to 
study "The History of Warfare," "History of the Development of 
Armed Forces," "History of the Military Arts," "Military 
Historiography" and the other courses of study that constitute 
this concept over 120 hours. It is obviously worth discussing 
the "History of Warfare"; a cadet, having studied it, should 
know the aims, nature, essence, experience in preparation and 
waging of the most important wars since ancient times up to the 
present day, the reasons for triumphs and defeats in them and 
the effects of wars on the development of Air Forces tactics. 
Anyone who has studied the "History of Warfare" should be able 
to make creative use of the knowledge he has obtained in his 
studies at the school and during service in the ranks. 
  The course "The History of the Military Arts" at the Air 
Forces academies will become the next, higher degree of 
acquisition of military-historical knowledge. Enrolled personnel 
should know, as a result of it, the history of the operational 
arts of the Air Forces and the ground forces since the time of 
their birth up to the present day, the fundamentals of the 
history of the operational arts of PVO [air defense] and naval 
forces, and the general laws, principles and lessons that arise 
from the experience of the development of the operational arts. 
The nature of the military-educational institution and the 
actual capabilities of the department or training cycle must 
naturally be taken into account when determining the dedicated 
purpose and content of the courses. 
  Four sections can be introduced into the course of "The 
History of the Military Arts," proceeding from the dedicated 
principle. The first considers the birth of the military arts in 
Russia and their development before World War I; the second, the 
development of the military arts during World War I, the civil 
war and the period between the wars; the third, World War II; 
and, the fourth, after World War II. The course could conclude 
with the study of the topics "The Lessons Arising Out of the 
Experience of the Development of the Military Arts" and the 
"Tasks of the Commander (Commanding Officer) in Supervising 
Military-Historical Work Among the Troops," with the subsequent 
passing of an examination. 
  The assimilation of the military-historical disciplines 
should precede, in the structural-logical system of training 
cadets and enrolled personnel, the study of the tactical 
disciplines at the schools and operational-tactical ones at the 
academies. Things are unfortunately still the reverse at the Air 
Forces Academy imeni Yu.A. Gagarin. 
  There is another substantive issue as well. The study of 
"Patriotic History" and "The History of the Military Arts" at 
the academies is now conducted in different departments, and 
there is no logical connection or succession between the 
disciplines. It would seem expedient to study the historical 
disciplines at the Air Forces higher educational institutions in 
a unified department of "The History of the Fatherland and the 
Military Arts," and in the departments and cycles of study of 
tactics at the Air Forces military schools. That is indeed what 
was done in prerevolutionary Russian military schooling, and is 
currently done at the higher educational institutions of the 
distant abroad. The Air Force Academy in the United States, for 
example, studies modern military history (120 hours) in the 
first year, the modern history of warfare and society (120 
hours) in the second, and military theories and an analysis of 
the state of armed forces (120 hours) in the fourth year. 
  The activity of military historians is in need of academic 
guidance on the scale of the Air Forces of the RF. This function 
could be entrusted to the Historical Group of the TsOTI of the 
Air Forces Main Staff or to a specially created 
academic-instructional council on a voluntary basis. It would 
formulate a strategy for military-historical work in the Air 
Forces, long-term plans for the publication of the necessary 
literature etc. 
  The publication of an official document (order, directive) 
with an analysis of the state and tasks of military-historical 
work in the Air Forces also seems expedient during the

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Technical Sciences Colonel A. Volodko, </F>
honored figure of science and engineering of the Russian 
Federation and State Prize laureate, under the rubric "Flight 
Safety: Investigating Flight Accidents": "Modeling Gives the 
Answers"] 
  [Text] Methods of mathematical modeling associated 
with the use of high-speed computers are becoming more and more 
widespread in the investigation of flight accidents [LPs], 
dangerous failures of aircraft hardware and errors by the flight 
personnel. The urgency of their use could seem, at first glance, 
not very great for modern aircraft equipped with Tester or 
MSRP-64 type flight data recording gear (BUR). 
  The informativeness of specific types of BUR naturally 
differs, but it provides a sufficiently complete representation 
of the nature of the development and, in the aggregate with a 
host of one-time commands, on the possible cause for the 
appearance of an emergency situation in flight. The parameters 
recorded, at the same time, frequently prove to be insufficient 
to establish the true cause of an LP. In order to make a 
judgment regarding the pattern of the airflow around an 
airframe, for example, it is essential to know the angles of 
attack and slip, which are not on the recording list. Most 
importantly, not one kind of BUR can determine the trajectory of 
aircraft movement, and it is the last leg of a flight (before an 
aircraft hits the ground), after all, that is of the greatest 
practical interest in the investigation of a flight accident. 
  The MSRP-12-93 magnetic flight recording system, installed 
on 
the An-12, An-26, Tu-95 and Tu-22 aircraft and Mi-6 helicopter 
in particular, records only 12 analog parameters of a flight, 
including the barometric pressure and indicated airspeed, 
vertical G-forces, angles of deflection of the controls, angles 
or angular velocities of pitch and roll and two or three 
diagnostic parameters of the operation of the power plant. The 
SARPP-12 optical recording system employed on the MiG-23 
aircraft and Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters puts only six analog 
parameters onto photographic film. They are insufficient, in 
both cases, for an analysis of the development of an emergency 
situation and the establishment of the causes for an LP. 
  It also happens that the information medium is destroyed, 
lost or stolen. A representation of the trajectory and nature of 
the movement of an aircraft on the last leg of its flight is 
formulated in such cases according to indirect indications 
(sketch maps, ground objects destroyed, the results of study of 
the aircraft hardware, the indications of witnesses and the 
like). 
  Mathematical modeling of the dynamics of a flight thus 
proves 
to be useful and necessary, both with the availability of 
information from flight data recording systems and, the more so, 
in the absence of it for any reason. When investigating a flight 
accident it allows, by way of example, computation of the 
parameters of aircraft movement according to a known initial 
flight mode and assumed destabilizing factors. 
  The legitimacy of versions that are put forth with reference 
to the circumstances of the flight accident is analyzed, in that 
case, according to the results of mathematical modeling of the 
dynamic reaction of the aircraft to the effects of disturbances 
caused by the failures of the aircraft hardware or erroneous 
controlling actions of the pilot that are being considered. 
  Tasks of the second type (the reciprocal task of flight 
dynamics) are also posed and resolved in those cases when, 
according to the objective data (information from the on-board 
recording devices, radar plotting of the flight route), the 
trajectory of movement and the angular position of the aircraft 
are known, with unknown destabilizing factors present. The 
forces and moments required for the parameters of such movement, 
as well as the necessary settings of the controls to create 
them, are determined according to the results of the 
mathematical modeling. This provides an opportunity, based on 
cause-and-effect links, to single out from among the aggregate 
of proposed versions only those that satisfy, or at least do not 
contradict, the actual parameters of the aircraft flight in the 
emergency situation. 
  An evaluation of the good working order of the aircraft 
hardware is accomplished only for an aircraft equipped with the 
Tester or MSRP-64 systems. The flight mass (m), center of 
gravity of the aircraft, trim positions of the controls, 
stability reserves, moments of extension or retraction of the 
flaps or air brakes, changes in the sweep angle of the wings and 
some other important data can be singled out therein when 
investigating an LP. 
  The dynamic equations of Euler are the methodological 
foundation for modeling the dynamics of aircraft movement, with 
the aircraft in most cases considered to be an absolute solid 
body of constant mass (1): 
  m(V[.sup]x[/] + _o_[.sub]y[/]V[.sub]z[/] 
-_o_[.sup]z[/]V[.sub]y[/]) = R[.sub]x[/], 
  m(V[.sup]y[/] + _o_[.sub]z[/]V[.sub]x[/] 
-_o_[.sup]x[/]V[.sub]z[/]) = R[.sub]y[/], 
  m(V[.sup]z[/] + _o_[.sub]x[/]V[.sub]y[/] 
-_o_[.sup]y[/]V[.sub]x[/]) = R[.sub]z[/], 
  I[.sup]x[/]_o_[.sub]x[/] + (I[.sub]z[/] 
-I[.sup]y[/])_o_[.sub]y[/]_o_[.sub]z[/] 
-I[.sup]xy[/]_o_[.sub]y[/] = M[.sub]x[/], 
  I[.sup]y[/]_o_[.sub]y[/] + (I[.sub]x[/] 
-I[.sup]z[/])_o_[.sub]x[/]_o_[.sub]z[/] 
-I[.sup]xy[/]_o_[.sub]x[/] = M[.sub]y[/], 
  I[.sup]z[/]_o_[.sub]z[/] + (I[.sub]y[/] 
-I[.sup]x[/])_o_[.sub]x[/]_o_[.sub]y[/] + 
I[.sup]xy[/](_o_[.sub]y[/][.sup]2[/] 
-_o_[.sup]x[/][.sup]2[/]) = M[.sub]z[/], 
  where V[.sup]x[/], V[.sub]y[/], V[.sub]z[/], 
_o_[.sup]x[/], _o_[.sub]y[/] and _o_[.sub]z[/] are 
projections of the linear and angular velocity of the aircraft 
on the right body axis of the system of coordinates; 
R[.sup]x[/], R[.sub]y[/], R[.sub]z[/], M[.sub]x[/], 
M[.sup]y[/] and M[.sub]z[/] are projections on the same 
coordinates of the resultant forces and moments acting on the 
aircraft; and, I[.sup]x[/], I[.sub]y[/], I[.sub]z[/] 
and I[.sup]xy[/] are the moments of inertia of the aircraft 
with regard to the corresponding axes of the coordinates. 
  For a helicopter, the system of equations (1) is usually 
supplemented with an equation of the dynamic of rotation of the 
main rotor: 
  I[.sup]r[/]_o_ = M[.sub]eng[/] - M[.sub]t[/], 
  where _o_ is the angular velocity of the rotation of the 
main 
rotor; M[.sup]eng[/] is the available rotating moment of the 
engines; M[.sup]t[/] is the required torque of the main and 
tail rotors; and, I[.sup]r[/] is the polar moment of inertia 
of the main rotor and the assemblies kinematically linked with 
it. 
  The angular velocities of pitch _o_[.sup]z[/], roll 
_o_[.sup]x[/] and yaw _o_[.sub]y[/] are determined as a 
result of integrating the equations for the dynamic of aircraft 
rotations with regard to the center of mass, and are used to 
compute the corresponding angles _n_, _g_, and _ps_. 
  The trajectory of movement in the system of ground 
coordinates is determined according to the components of the 
forward speed of flight V[.sup]x[/], V[.sub]y[/], and 
V[.sup]z[/] and the angles _n_, _g_, and _ps_. 
  The forces R[.sup]x[/], R[.sub]y[/] and R[.sub]z[/] 
and the moments M[.sup]x[/], M[.sub]y[/] and 
M[.sup]z[/] acting on the aircraft and determining the right 
portions of the system of equations (1) are quite complex, 
non-linear functions of the design parameters of the aircraft 
and the kinematic parameters of its flight (the speed and 
barometric altitude, angles of attack and slip, angular 
velocities of pitch, roll and yaw, positions of the controls). 
These forces and moments are determined by the aerodynamic 
design of the aircraft, and are entered into the computer using 
interpolation tables, polynomials or rough approximation 
formulas. 
  The law of automatic control of aircraft flight is usually 
realized in the form 
  T[.sup]_D_+_D_[/] = K[.sub]1[/]_D_q + 
K[.sup]2[/]_D_q[.sub]i[/], 
  where D[.sup][/]is the settings of the controls 
(elevator, stabilizer, ailerons, cyclic pitch control and the 
like); _D_q[.sup]i[/] is the change in the kinematic 
parameters being controlled or stabilized (angle of pitch or 
roll, heading, speed and altitude of the flight) from the set 
trim position; and T[.sup][/]K[.sub]i[/] is a constant 
for time and the gear ratio of the SAU [automatic control 
system] (autopilot). 
  The modeling of the operation of the power plant plays an 
important role in investigating an LP, the more so as it is 
namely its failure in flight that is the cause of most emergency 
situations and accidents. The mathematical model of the power 
plant, in its most general and simplified form, includes the 
known operational characteristics of the engines (throttle, 
altitude and speed, climatic), an equation for the dynamics of 
the turbocompressor rotor 
  T[.sup]n[/]_D_n[.sub]tc[/] + _D_n[.sub]tc[/] = 
K[.sup]G[/]_D_G[.sub]T[/], 
  and the law of engine control 
  T[.sup]G[/]_D_G[.sub]T[/] + _D_G[.sub]T[/] = 
K[.sup]_a_[/]_D__a_[.sub]ec[/], 
  as well as the laws for the automatic regulation and 
limitation of the defining parameters of the engines. 
  Here _D_n[.sup]TK[/] and _D_G[.sub]T[/] are the changes 
in the rotational frequency of the turbocompressor rotor and the 
hourly consumption of fuel compared to their established values 
in the initial flight mode of the aircraft; _D__a_[.sup]ec[/] 
is the setting of the engine control level from the set trim 
position; and, T[.sup]G[/] and K[.sub]G[/] are a time 
constant and a transfer factor defining the characteristics of 
the engine (time of pickup and throttling). 
  The mathematical model for the dynamic of the flight defines 
the unstable three-dimensional controlled movement of the 
aircraft in special situations, caused by the failure of the 
aircraft hardware, erroneous control actions by the pilot or 
intensive external influences. The modeling of disturbing 
factors is usually accomplished in the form of various time 
functions with varying parameters, approximately describing 
objective data on the circumstances of the flight accident and 
(or) put forward in the course of investigating a version as the 
possible cause of an accident. 
  One may cite as examples of the modeling of typical 
disturbing factors: 
  --the complete, unexpected failure of one of the two 
engines, 
accompanied by a reduction in its thrust or power according to a 
law close to exponential; 
  --the mechanical jamming of a control channel; 
  --the break-off of a piece of the main rotor, accompanied by 
the effect of cyclical unbalanced centrifugal force 
_D_Nsin_o_t; 
  --the effects on the aircraft of a vertical ascending gust 
of 
wind with a velocity W and gradient section of velocity build-up 
_t_. 
  The disturbing factors are naturally individual in each 
specific case in the investigation of a flight accident, but 
their modeling requires a certain experience and skill of the 
researcher. 
  Mathematical modeling is successfully employed, aside from 
the global task of flight dynamics considered, to resolve a 
broad circle of partial but in practice exceedingly important 
tasks, among which could be included: 
  --the ballistic computation of the trajectory of destroyed 
elements of an aircraft that have separated in flight 
(stabilizer surfaces, parts of a propeller blade, cockpit canopy 
and the like); 
  --modeling of the non-standard interaction of the SAU with 
elements of the piloting and navigational system; 
  --computation of the intensive flywheel movement of an 
elastic main rotor blade accompanying a blow by the end of the 
blade against the tail boom of the helicopter in a single-rotor 
configuration; 
  --modeling of the overturning of a helicopter in a 
non-design-rated turn in taxiing etc. 
  Improvements in the mathematical models, for the realization 
of which personal computers are beginning to be utilized 
successfully, including those using leads coming from on-board 
flight data recording gear, are constantly underway.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences Colonel </F>
(Reserve) K. Suponko under the rubric "Advice for IAS 
Specialists": "They Have Their Own Concerns in Summer"] 
  [Text] The servicing of aviation hardware in the summertime 
has a number of specific features, knowledge of which will help 
personnel to avert breakdowns in flight in a timely manner. 
  One of the most typical causes of failures is the refueling 
of an aircraft or helicopter using substandard fuel that 
contains water. This is usually a consequence of the violation 
of regulations for its storage in fuel dumps, and a lack of 
airtight seals on service and holding tanks and airfield fuel 
lines. The development and testing of the IVT-1 instrument to 
monitor fuel for the presence of water has currently been 
completed, and a small lot of them has arrived in VTA 
[military-transport aviation] units. It would be expedient to 
employ potassium permanganate in places that do not yet have 
those instruments; it provides an easily noticeable reaction 
with water. 
  Rain can bring quite a bit of unpleasantness. The pipes of 
the central aircraft refueling system were underwater at one 
airfield after a downpour. The water got into the pipeline 
through a bad seal and later, with inadequate monitoring of the 
fuel, into the tanks of aircraft, which led to the failure of 
several engines in flight. It should be noted that draining the 
residue from aircraft tanks does not always make it possible to 
detect substandard fuel in a timely manner; this is because 
there are areas in the lower portion of the fuel tanks of some 
types of aircraft that are not in communication with the drain 
points. They can be formed either by the folds of soft fuel 
tanks, or by longitudinal and transverse metallic partitions. 
The undrained fuel residue sometimes reaches several dozen 
liters. It is thus essential, when instances of the refueling of 
aircraft with substandard fuel have been ascertained, not only 
to drain it by the usual methods, but also to extract the 
residue from the undrained areas. 
  The consequences of operating engines using fuel with water 
are the extinguishing of the flame in the combustion chamber, 
disruption of fuel feed owing to clogging of the fine filters 
with water, and corrosion damage to parts of the fuel-regulating 
apparatus, leading to its jamming or sticking. The decision on 
the procedure for the further servicing of an aircraft after 
refueling with substandard fuel is made after an engineering 
analysis of its technical condition, with a regard for the 
requirements of servicing documentation. 
  The contamination of GSM [fuels and lubricants] in the 
summer 
is also possible when dust gets into them. The use of a closed 
refueling system under pressure is thus recommended, under 
conditions of enhanced dust, for those aircraft whose design 
provides for it, with measures to protect against dust 
penetration observed for open refueling. When systems are 
unsealed (for the replacement of fuel, oil and hydraulic 
filters, for example), steps that rule out the entry of 
mechanical impurities into them must also be envisaged. 
  The state of the filter elements is objective evidence of 
the 
cleanliness of the operating fluids. The level of their 
dirtiness is determined by their flow duration using a PKF 
(filter element monitoring instrument)--the greater the 
duration, the dirtier the filter element. This check is 
performed during routine operations before the ultrasound 
cleaning of the filter elements, as well as after it. If they 
turn out to be very dirty, it is essential to determine the 
causes for that in order to endure the failure-free operation of 
the aircraft in flight. 
  If a lack of airtightness is detected in the systems, the 
possible appearance of the physical phenomenon of obliteration 
should be taken into account. It essence is as follows--a leak 
through a slot of micron dimensions, starting quite intensively, 
decreases appreciably over a certain time, and in some cases 
even ceases. This occurs as a result of the mechanical 
contamination of the narrow channels with insoluble particles, 
as well as the formation of a special aggregate state of the 
liquid molecules on the walls of the channels that creates 
boundary layers with a certain strength. Obliteration 
accelerates with an increase in the consumption of the operating 
liquids through the slot and with increases in temperature, 
which is typical of summertime conditions. One must thus not be 
limited to wiping and the tightening of joints, even if there is 
no seepage detected after that for a certain period of time; it 
is essential to make sure that the obliteration of a crack has 
not been "hidden," and whose further development could have 
dangerous consequences. If it is detected, the damaged parts 
must simply be replaced and the conditions and reasons for the 
appearance of the crack established, in order to make sure that 
it is not the manifestation of some other flaw such as an 
increased level of vibrations. 
  The most dangerous consequence of a lack of airtight seals 
in 
the fuel, oil and hydraulic systems is the outbreak of a fire. 
Operating fluids are ignited when they come into contact with 
hot sections of aircraft or engine systems, as well as damaged 
sections of electrical wiring. The most easily combustible ones, 
even in the absence of open flame, are the hydraulic liquids and 
lubricating oils. This danger increases during summer servicing 
periods, since the temperatures of structural elements of the 
aircraft increase through external heating. 
  Turbojet engines [TRD] are easily started under conditions 
of 
increased temperatures of the surrounding air. The start-up of a 
TRD that has not had time to cool down after shutoff, however, 
has certain specific features. There is an engine speed holdup 
with the throwing of the gas temperature behind the turbine in 
start-up, owing to the fact that the air in the air-intake 
channel and in the engines is heated. Such failures used to be 
of a mass nature with start-ups of hot AL-21F-3 type engines. 
Recommendations were thus entered into the servicing manuals, 
after special research that determined that the RUD [engine 
controls] should be moved to "idle" 30--35 seconds after pushing 
the "start" button when starting up an engine that had not had 
time to cool down. The cranking of the turbine to remove the 
heated air from the air-gas duct and subsequent start-up were 
thereby combined into one cycle. 
  Aircraft and helicopters should be positioned in such a way 
that their air intakes are pointed into the direction of the 
wind, especially when they are high in velocity, for the more 
reliable start-up of gas-turbine engines of all types. This 
improves the cooling of the engines, and reduces the required 
capacity of the electric-power sources by easing the cranking of 
the rotors. 
  Attention should also be paid to the fact that the 
parameters 
for the start-up and idle mode also carry valuable diagnostic 
information on the technical condition of the engine. There have 
been many cases where the flight, engineering and technical 
personnel have been able to ascertain dangerous failures of the 
automatic fuel apparatus by increasing the duration of the 
start-up cycle according to the value of the maximum gas 
temperature behind the turbine. The idle mode is the first 
operating mode of the power plant that establishes an 
equilibrium, which is maintained by a minimal consumption of 
fuel. The engine is thus more sensitive to changes in the state 
of the elements in its flow portions. It is possible to 
ascertain in a timely fashion, by monitoring the rate to reach 
revolutions and temperatures in idle mode, such problems as 
damage and destruction of compressor and turbine blades, cracks 
in the combustion chamber, and the destruction of fuel feed 
lines to the nozzles of the main combustion chamber. 
  The likelihood of deviations in the structural elements of 
the aircraft from increased discharges of static electricity 
increases appreciably in the summer, creating the danger of a 
discharge during fueling and a subsequent fire. The reliable 
grounding of both the aircraft and the refueling equipment is 
therefore essential, especially after the return of aircraft and 
helicopters from dense clouds and areas of thunderstorm activity. 
  The specific features of servicing runway equipment during 
the summer include regular monitoring of the air in pneumatic 
tires. The point is that when the temperature of the surrounding 
air increases by 15C, the pressure in the tires increases 
by 10--12 percent, leading to increased likelihood of their 
rupture in sharp braking. 
  Summer also requires increased attention toward ensuring the 
protection of engines against the entry of dust and small 
foreign particles from the surfaces of the airfield. Erosive 
wear and damage to parts of the air-gas duct by foreign 
particles leads to a reduction in the reserves of gas-dynamic 
stability and the formation of nicks--concentrations of stresses 
that are often the centers for the formation of fatigue cracks. 
Constant monitoring should thus be performed--both when 
preparing for flights and when making them--of the cleanliness 
of the areas where the engines are started and tested, as well 
as the taxiways and runways. The likelihood of the entry of 
foreign objects into the air intakes is increased when the rules 
for aircraft taxiing are violated (high speed, high engine RPMs) 
and when the moving row of aircraft is blown by gas streams. 
  The trajectory of the movement of particles in the operation 
of helicopter power plants has its own specific features. The 
dust raised by the inductive flow of the main rotor moves to the 
periphery of the area swept by the main rotor, is sucked up into 
the zone of rarefaction under it, and then is thrown back down 
by the inductive flow. A considerable portion of that dust is in 
the rarefaction zone created by the engines and is sucked into 
the air intakes. It must be noted that helicopters with 
gas-turbine engines, as opposed to aircraft, do not create 
vortex or turbulent flows that throw the dust right from the 
ground into the air intakes. Special dust-protection devices are 
employed as design features on helicopters. The cleanliness of 
the separators must be checked on aircraft fitted with them 
during flight preparations. Their fouling leads to a reduction 
in the effectiveness of the dust-protection devices, and to an 
increase in the non-productive expenditures of engine capacity.

Theme": "Would Be Glad To Serve..."] 
  [Text] The experience of domestic and foreign military 
reforms shows that when they are implemented, the central issue 
was and remains the professional training of military cadres. 
The current military reform, in the course of which the 
foundations are being laid and the prospects defined for the 
development of the new Russian armed forces, is no exception. A 
study of the readiness of officers who are graduates of military 
academies for professional activity is of particular interest in 
this regard. This interest is explained by the fact that 
tomorrow, serving in official positions, they will largely 
determine the state of the army, its image and the level of 
training. 
  The changes in all spheres of the life of society are having 
an objective influence on the consciousness of citizens, 
including officers. The nature and results of this influence 
were of interest to a group of research sociologists of the 
Academy of Humanities, who conducted a poll of the enrolled 
personnel in the final-year courses at the VVA [Military 
Aviation Academy] imeni Yu.A. Gagarin and the VVIA [Military 
Aviation Engineering Academy] imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy in 1992. 
Some 211 people were selected under a quantitively regulated 
sample to provide sufficient representativeness. 
  The results of the poll established that most of the 
respondents were guided in the choice of the profession of 
officer first and foremost by socially significant motives (Fig. 
1). Some 81.8 percent of those polled, in evaluating the 
usefulness of the labor of an officer compared with other types 
of activity, noted its high or very high significance. These 
data provide grounds to suppose that the greater portion of the 
respondents were guided in their choice of profession by moral 
incentives, and the prestige of the profession of officer in 
society played a substantial role in the formation of the 
professional-military thrust of their choice.

    Most of the graduates have a high regard for their labor as 
before. The difficult processes in the life of society, however, 
are more and more adjusting the social portrait of the graduate 
of the military academy. Significant changes in the system of 
value orientations are being observed in the environment of the 
servicemen as well. These polls show that more than half of the 
officer graduates today place tranquil service conditions, low 
tension, high earnings and sufficient time for relaxation in 
first place when evaluating their service activity (Fig. 2). A 
tendency for the displacement of values orientations from 
socially to personally significant is clearly pronounced. It 
became clearly in the polling that most of the respondents 
consider the receipt of high earnings to be the most important 
thing for themselves. The officer--the representative and 
expressor of state and social interests--thus has personal 
rather than social values in the forefront. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-004C-10A>           Fig. 2. Choice of values in service activity </FIG>





    The process of further cutbacks in the size of the army and 
the uncertainty of the future is having a negative effect on the 
mood of academy graduates. Some 80.41 percent of the respondents 
have a pessimistic assessment of their prospects, and only 18.92 
percent are optimistic about the opportunities to continue their 
service. The problem of the drop in prestige of officer service 
in society also cannot pass unmentioned. The opinions of the 
graduates are quite well-founded, and reflect that picture (87.4 
percent had a negative answer to the question of the prestige of 
the service). 
  A dilemma faces the graduates of military academies, and 
many 
officers in general--to continue to serve or to resign into the 
reserves?

  The table shows the attitude of Air Forces academy officer 
graduates toward this problem. Just 2.8 percent expressed a firm 
desire to serve. Uncertainty in the responses was typical--54.9 
percent of those polled had a difficult time giving a clear-cut 
answer, which is most likely explained by the lack of clear 
prospects and the situation in the country. The vividly 
pronounced readiness of most of the attendees to be discharged 
from the army cannot help but cause alarm. Many (35.8 percent) 
are being held back from that step only for reasons of a 
socio-economic nature--the lack of housing, not enough time 
served, the fear of not finding work. This fact cannot help but 
make one wonder about the qualitative composition of the future 
command personnel of the Air Forces. One can hardly hope that an 
officer who is inwardly ready for early discharge, and wishes 
for it, will perform the duties entrusted to him by the state 
and society in a creative manner and with good return. 
  The desire of graduates to be discharged into the reserves 
was verified during the questioning with the aid of a control 
poll. Data were obtained in that that make it possible to 
conclude that more than 40 percent of them do not wish to serve. 
The main reason determining the desire to be discharged is the 
lack of social protections and dissatisfaction with material 
status--38.8 of those polled. Another 33.6 percent explain their 
decision by the decline in prestige of military service, 11.21 
percent by its lack of prospects, and 7.76 percent by negative 
phenomena in the army and society. 
  Study of the readiness of graduates of Air Forces academies 
for service has confirmed that one of the main components of 
this concept, complex in composition, is the 
military-professional thrust of the officer. It is expressed in 
the high significance of military affairs for him and the 
military specialty he has selected, as well as in the level and 
pattern of his official aspirations. All changes in this thrust 
most naturally have an effect on the state of professional 
readiness. The data cited make it possible to conclude that a 
reduction in military-professional thrust is being observed in 
some of the graduates of Air Forces academies. The negative 
consequences of this process are obvious. 
  The principal contradictions, among those affecting the 
formulation of the professional readiness of the officer, are 
manifested between the constantly increasing demands on the 
officer corps and the not clearly expressed desire to conform to 
them; the need to protect the Fatherland and the low social 
status of the officer in society and lack of social protections; 
and, the desire to improve knowledge and skills and the presence 
of various types of regimentation. 
  Sociological analysis makes it possible to determine the 
areas of work that will be able to provide for the resolution of 
these discrepancies in the future, and to formulate some 
recommendations. 
  It seems expedient, then, to alter the system of selection 
both for all types of military-training institutions (including 
the military academies) and for assignment to positions. The 
principal criteria should become the level of 
military-professional thrust, the individual capabilities and 
features, the overall development of the intellect and the level 
of specialization attained. This would make it possible, with 
the scientifically substantiated organization of selection, to 
avoid subjectivism in the resolution of personnel issues and to 
eliminate protectionism. We do not yet have at our disposal 
reliable, comprehensive techniques that would make it possible 
to accomplish these tasks. But they do not exist only because 
they have not yet been in demand. The combined efforts of 
various specialists, with the corresponding social demand, will 
provide an opportunity to develop the necessary techniques in a 
relatively short time. 
  It would be expedient, on an organizational plane, to 
individualize the process of professional training for the 
officer, with the aim of making fuller use of individual 
capabilities, abilities and characteristics. The content of 
training should be as close as possible to the practices of 
military activity; this requires, on the one hand, an 
optimization of existing forms and methods of training and, on 
the other, substantial changes in the theoretical and practical 
training of instructors. A modern physical plant and the 
development of a system of incentives, along with changes in the 
methodological support for the teaching process, deserve 
particular attention. 
  The solution of the problems of social and legal protections 
for officers (and all servicemen!) and their provision with 
acceptable material conditions seems very important. If the 
state needs today's military professionals, it should provide 
full-fledged solutions to these problems. Otherwise, the outflow 
of more than the worst personnel from the army in the very near 
future will lead objectively to a clear reduction in the level 
of professional readiness of the officers, which could call into 
question not only the practice of military reform, but even the 
very idea of it. 
  It seems obvious that the comprehensive realization of the 
above recommendations is an essential condition of their 
utilization for the attainment of positive results. That is 
because incomplete work or omissions in any of the three areas 
noted will make it impossible to achieve the desired 
effectiveness in the training of cadres for the new Russian Army. 
  From the Editors. The sociological research 
whose data have been employed by the author was conducted in the 
summer of 1992. The economic situation and the problems 
connected with it have scarcely become less acute since that 
time. Military reform, however, is proceeding. Thanks to the 
adoption of a series of legislation, and first and foremost the 
Law on the Status of Servicemen and the Law on Pension Support 
for Servicemen, the situation has obviously changed. We will 
acquaint the readers in coming features with how the mood of Air 
Forces cadres is changing in the course of military reform, and 
how the greater social and legal certainty of the status of the 
officer in society is affecting them.

Reflection": "Ground-Attack Aircraft"] 
  [Text] Ground-attack aircraft, which were developed 
most heavily in Soviet aviation during the Great Patriotic War, 
were removed from service in the 1950s. The work stopped at that 
time on the try-out of new aircraft in this class. The 
experience of local wars, however, forced a return to the idea 
of creating a specialized, well-armored aircraft armed with a 
powerful cannon for the battlefield. The Su-25 and the A-10A 
thus appeared almost simultaneously in the USSR and the United 
States. 
<H6>  Su-25 </H6>
  Versions. Su-25 UB (1985)--combat trainer; SU-25UT 
(1988)--trainer intended for air clubs; SU-25UTG 
(1989)--carrier-based trainer. 
  Crew. One. 
  Dimensions. Wingspan of 14.36 meters, area of 30.1 
m[.sup]2[/]; length of aircraft (with PVD [pitot boom]) 15.36 
meters, height 4.8 meters. 
  Mass (with R-195 TRDs [turbojet engines]). Maximum 
takeoff 17,600 kg, normal takeoff 14,600 kg. 
  Flight characteristics (with R-95Sh TRDs). Maximum 
speed at ground level 950 km/hr, landing speed 200 km/hr; 
maximum weapons delivery altitude 5,000 meters; effective flight 
range with ordnance load of 1,000 kg and without external fuel 
tanks at ground level 510 km, maximum ferry range with four 
external tanks more than 1,850 km; turning radius with 1,500 kg 
bombs at altitude of 1,500 meters: 570 meters at speed of 460 
km/hr, 680 meters at speed of 555 km/hr; takeoff run 600 meters 
on hard-surfaced runways, 1,200 meters on unimproved runways; 
landing runout on concrete runway 400 meters (600 meters without 
braking chute); maximum operational G-forces of 6.5 with 
ordnance load of 1,500 kg, 5.2 with load of 4,000 kg. 
  Engines. R-95Sh (2 x 4,100 kgf) turbojet engines, 
R-195 (2 x 4,500 kgf) on later models. 
  Armaments. Gravity bombs of 100 to 500 kg, small 
payload pods, 57 to 270 mm rockets, air-to-ground missiles with 
Kh-25 and Kh-29 laser or television homing systems, cluster 
bombs of various types, pods with cannons or two R-60M 
air-to-air missiles on ten pylons. Normal mass of armaments on 
external stores racks 1,000 kg, maximum of 4,000 kg. Built-in 
armaments are GSh-30 twin-barrel cannon (30mm, 250 rounds, rate 
of fire 3,000 rounds/minute). 
  Equipment. ASP-17BTs-8 firing and bomb sight, 
Klen-PS laser rangefinder/target designator, A-031 radio 
altimeter, DISS-7 Doppler speed and drift angle meter, passive 
means of infrared protection, K-36 ejection seat. The aircraft 
design employed a fully welded cockpit with titanium armor, a 
canopy with an armored front optical block, protected fuel tanks 
filled with porous materials, and control lines with enhanced 
damage resistance. Later versions of the aircraft have the TRDs 
separated by an armored partition, and the firefighting system 
was improved using freon. An autonomous system of technical 
maintenance located in four pods that are transported on the 
external pylons of the Su-25 aircraft was developed for the 
aircraft, providing for the servicing of the aircraft at 
unimproved frontal airfields. 
  The SU-25 with the R-195 engine may be used as a target tow 
and platform for diving targets. 
  Status. In service with the air forces of the CIS 
countries, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Iraq.

  The necessity arose at the end of the 1960s of creating a 
ground-attack aircraft able to wage battle successfully against 
small targets on the battlefield and at the front line, as well 
as for use in local conflicts. Attempts were undertaken to make 
such an aircraft on the basis of the Il-28 bomber, as well as to 
"resuscitate" the Il-40 project of the 1950s. Under these 
conditions, the OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] of P. Sukhoy 
proposed at the end of the 1960s, on its own initiative, the 
creation of a light and highly maneuverable armored 
ground-attack aircraft that would be fitted with existing 
armaments and equipment. Despite the fact that the idea did not 
meet with the unanimous support of the Air Forces (the pilots 
wanted to get an aircraft with advanced armaments and BREO 
[on-board electronics gear] optimized for use in ground-attack 
aviation), the program obtained approval from the leadership of 
the Air Forces. The first flight of the experimental T-8-1 
aircraft fitted with the R-9 TRD (a variation of a 
non-afterburning engine that had been installed in the MiG-19), 
took place in 1975, after which the T-8-1 and T-8-2 experimental 
aircraft were fitted with R-95 TRDs created on the basis of the 
R-13 TRDF [afterburning turbojet engine]. Preparations for 
series production of the new aircraft began in 1976 at the 
aviation plant in the city of Tbilisi, and the first flight took 
place in 1978. 
  Twenty three aircraft were lost during combat operations in 
Afghanistan, with the death of eight pilots. One aircraft that 
was shot down had accumulated 2,800 hours of combat flying time. 
The Su-25 as a whole proved to be a most effective strike 
aircraft in Afghanistan. 
  The Su-25 earned the highest evaluation in the Iraqi Air 
Forces during the Iran-Iraq War. 
  Iraqi Su-25s were effectively not employed in combat 
operations in the Persian Gulf, but two aircraft were shot down 
by American fighters while attempting to fly to Iranian 
territory. 
  The improved Su-25T, which is deserving of a separate 
article, was created on the basis of the Su-25. 
<H6>  Fairchild-Republic A-10A Thunderbolt II </H6>
  Versions. A-10B--a two-seat trainer, 
N/AW-10 (1979)--a version of the A-10B for operations 
at night and in bad weather conditions, OA-10D--forward air 
spotting and target-designation aircraft (retrofitted from 
series-production A-10A aircraft). 
  Crew. One. 
  Dimensions. Wingspan of 17.53 meters, area of 
47.01 m[.sup]2[/]; length of aircraft 16.26 meters, height 
4.47 meters. 
  Mass. Maximum takeoff 23,680 kg, in takeoff from 
unimproved airfields 14,865 kg, without ordnance 11,320 kg; fuel 
in internal tanks 4,853 kg, in external tanks 5,300 kg (3 x 
2,270 liters). 
  Flight characteristics. Top speed of 722 km/hr, 
speed at 1,500 meters with six 227-kg bombs 704 km/hr; cruising 
speed 623 km/hr at altitude of 1,500 meters; radius of 
operations when performing tasks of close support (including 
loitering for 1.7 hours) 460 km,, with deep strikes into enemy 
rear 1,000 km, ferry range of 3,950 km; takeoff run 760 meters, 
landing runout (with braking parachute) 410 meters. 
  Engines. General Electric TF34-GE-100 
TRDDs [afterburning turbojet engines] (2 x 4,100 kgf). 
  Armaments. GAU-8A Avenger cannon (30 
mm, 1,174 rounds, rate of fire 2,100/4,200 rounds/minute), up to 
28 Mk.82 bombs (227 kg), up to six Mk.84 bombs (904 kg), up to 
eight BLU-1 or BLU-27/B ZABs [incendiary bombs], up 
to 20 Rockeye RBKs [combat missile systems], up to 18 
GBU-12 KABs [cluster bombs] (with laser homing 
systems) or GBU-10 KABs, up to six 
AGM-65A/B/D Maverick guided missiles, two 
AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles, two SUU-23 (20 
mm) external cannon pods. The number of weapons racks is eleven, 
with a maximum load of 7,260 kg. 
  Equipment. The Tacan radionavigational system, the 
ASN-141 INS [inertial navigation system], an 
instrument landing system, ILS [head-up display], ELT 
[television radar display] indicator providing the opportunity 
to employ the Maverick missiles with television or infrared 
homing systems; the AN/AAS-38 Pave Penny laser target 
search and tracking laser system in a pod under the fuselage in 
the nose (there is no laser rangefinder/target designator; the 
aircraft is able to operate against targets illuminated by laser 
from another aircraft or the ground), an AN/ALR-46(V), 
AN/ALR-64 or AN/ALR-69 radar illumination warning receiver, 
an AN/ALE-37 or AN/ALE-40 chaff and IR 
decoy dispenser, and an AN/ALQ-119 pod with jamming 
transmitters (on external racks). 
  The installation of a system to warn of proximity to the 
ground is also possible. Armoring protects the cockpit and other 
vitally important parts of the aircraft against shells up to 23 
mm in caliber (the mass of the cockpit armor box is 544 kg). 
  The ejection seat is a McDonnell-Douglas ACES-II. 
  There is an aerial refueling system as well. 
  Status. Series produced from 1975 to 1984. There 
were 813 aircraft built. There were 610 A-10A/B and 20 OA-10D 
aircraft in service with the Air Force and the National Guard of 
the United States in 1992. The aircraft costs 7.3 million 
dollars (at 1980 rates). It was not supplied for export.

  Additional information. Generation of TTT 
[tactical-performance specifications] in 1966, issue of 
contracts for development in 1970, first flight of experimental 
aircraft in 1975. The experimental two-seat N/A-10W 
version, refitted from the A-10B trainer and intended for 
operations at night and in bad weather conditions, was tested in 
1979. Testing of aircraft equipped with AIM-9 
Sidewinder missiles, intended for self-defense, was conducted in 
1986. The possibility of replacing these aircraft with A-16 
strike aircraft using the General Dynamics F-16C 
fighter has been under study in the United States since the end 
of the 1980s (an aircraft of this type was to have performed the 
tasks of close support and battlefield air interdiction, 
i.e. combine the functions of a ground-attack 
aircraft and a fighter/bomber), owing to the ineffectiveness of 
the A-10 in operations against the second echelon of enemy 
subunits. Funds were not allocated for the program, however, 
because of the cutbacks in defense spending. 
  The high survivability of the aircraft made it possible to 
retrofit some of the ground-attack aircraft into forward air 
spotter aircraft (they are replacing the North American 
OV-10 Bronco aircraft, which had been used as far 
back as in Vietnam, in this role). 
  The A-10A showed itself to be one of the most effective 
means 
of defeating manpower and vehicles on the battlefield during the 
combat operations in the Persian Gulf. The aircraft were 
employed both day and night (with the aiming performed using the 
infrared homing heads of the Maverick missiles). The combat 
losses were five A-10A aircraft. Fire from the cannon of an 
A-10A attack aircraft shot down an Iraqi Mi-8 helicopter.

"There Was Such a Case": "SOS in the Iranian Sky"] 
  [Text] Was our country selling weapons in the world 
market? The answer is unequivocal--yes, we were selling weapons 
and combat hardware. The only thing that cannot be understood 
is, why hide it from our own people? Quite a few articles have 
been published on this score in the open--but foreign 
(!)--press, citing figures that testify eloquently that the 
trade was profitable for us. And not only in a financial regard, 
but first and foremost in a political one as well. There, as 
they say, we were at the top. 
  An entirely concrete instance compelled me to take up the 
once-forbidden topic. I found out about it in a fighter air 
regiment armed with MiG-29 aircraft. I was interested, in a 
conversation with an engineer of the regiment, how matters stood 
with the delivery of spare parts and units to the technical 
maintenance unit [TECh]. In reply he only spread his arms--a 
total back-up, he said. It turned out that the "back-up" 
dictated its own rules. Some equipment in good working order was 
removed from an interceptor that had just come into the TECh and 
installed on an aircraft on which the regular maintenance work 
was almost completed. The newly arrived fighter was expected to 
be "stuffed" with parts from another one waiting for preventive 
repair. And so it goes around and around from month to month. 
  "We are selling MiGs abroad and sending the spare parts 
there, and we are left with nothing," summed up an officer in a 
fit of temper. 
  It was not all that hard to find out that some pilots in the 
regiment have already flown to Iran several times, ferrying 
MiG-29s procured by that country to them. The fliers, true, got 
no pleasure from these overseas trips--there were too many of 
all sorts of conventions in making the ferry flights. The 
notorious "just-in-case" was in effect here as well. Everything 
was heading toward something bad happening. And it did not take 
long. 
  The latest pair of fighters, piloted by deputy squadron 
commander Major A. Yermakov and senior pilot Captain S. Nikulin, 
headed off for Teheran at the end of September 1990. The pilots 
crossed the border of the USSR at a location coordinated in 
advance at the stipulated time. They then took a heading of 
120. It became clear that an instrument in the wingman's 
cockpit was steadily reading thirty degrees more than the lead 
pilot's. The latter unfortunately neglected the report of his 
subordinate on this, assured of his own infallibility. And when 
he finally thought about it, it was too late to make corrections. 
  The nominal flight time had expired. Teheran should have 
shown up below, with the airfield a little further. But... 
  Flight operations officer Major A. Berzan, who had arrived 
at 
the Mehrabat air base earlier to meet his countrymen, looked up 
at the sky in vain, listening for the characteristic drone of 
the fighters. He, after all, while controlling the fighters from 
the ground, had been left "blind"--radar monitoring of the air 
traffic in the area of the landing airfield was not being 
conducted for the pair of Soviet MiGs. The situation was 
clarified by a report over the air by the lead aircraft 
regarding a loss of orientation. Yermakov did not conceal the 
fact that his last hope in the prevailing situation was an 
escort aircraft, using which the possibility remained of 
reaching the end point of the route. The commander of the 
Iranian air base, however, did not fulfill his promise to help, 
and an F-5 that was in reserve for such a situation did not go 
up. 
  The pair of MiG-29s loitered for forty minutes over Iranian 
territory. Nikulin suddenly lost sight of the lead aircraft on 
one of their turns, after which he independently made the 
decision to look for the nearest airfield. The wingman was 
lucky. The captain unexpectedly saw a runway right on his 
heading and landed safely--now with almost no fuel in the 
tanks--at the Savi airfield. "I was born lucky," he commented 
laconically at the time on his good fortune. 
  But Yermakov, who had waited unsuccessfully for a guide 
aircraft, tried to land on a highway, but was hindered by the 
heavy vehicle traffic. Seeing the hopelessness of the situation, 
he ejected after an hour and fifty minutes of flying. "There was 
no damage on the ground. The pilot was unharmed," were the 
notations in the report. 
  Maybe so, but we know how to give a good spanking. So they 
exhaustively investigated the sad results of a generally 
ordinary flight, and the measures taken, judging by the official 
documents, were the strictest. Major Yermakov was relieved of 
his duties and dismissed from flight work, and the "lucky" 
Nikulin was disciplined as well. All's well that ends well. 
Nonetheless, in my opinion, the materials from the investigation 
did not reflect the main causes that led to the flight accident. 
One of them was the unsatisfactory preparation and support of 
the ferry flight. The regimental command did not know the 
concrete date of the ferry flight to fill out the necessary 
documents until the very day of departure of the pilots for 
Moscow. The fliers (called back the day before from leave, by 
the way) were given just seven days instead of the required 20 
to prepare for the performance of this task. Communications 
specialists had appealed more than once to higher-ups on the 
question of providing reliable radar control of the aircraft 
being transferred, but that was not resolved either. It turned 
out that the organizers of the flight had simply not stipulated 
in the agreement the necessity for the receiving side to turn on 
its tracking stations, or the amount of payment for their 
operation either... They economized themselves into disaster. 
  And here is a fact that is quite interesting, although it 
was 
not taken into account in the final order. Captain Nikulin made 
a forced landing at the airfield at Savi, which was not even 
indicated on his flight map, and indeed could not have been, 
since it was published in 1966, with some changes on it dated 
1981. It is incomprehensible why satellites are plying outer 
space--perhaps to photograph the license plates of cars... 
  Yes, the times are such that we have to economize in 
everything. But in this case they cannot bring themselves to 
call this economy squandering by the true steward. Is that not 
why the pilots are so reluctant to agree to the commercial ferry 
flights for which the Russian state pays them in dollars? Not 
everything is for sale...

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences Major-General V. </F>
Menshikov under the rubric "The Cosmodromes: Rockets and 
People": "Rocket Test Personnel"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  The Unskilled Workers of Space Science </H6>
  The test and operational personnel at the cosmodrome were 
called the "the unskilled workers of the Earth." A song written 
by local composers even has the words, "The unskilled workers of 
the Earth are launching ships into space..." 
  But far from everyone knows that Baykonur also has 
"unskilled 
workers' unskilled workers." People dear to my heart and 
soul--the officers, warrant officers, sergeants and soldiers of 
the units for combat support and maintenance. They include 
repair and reconditioning, railroad, power and water battalions, 
subunits for the heat and power systems, oxygen and nitrogen, 
bread-baking and many others. They are to the cosmodrome as air 
is to people--you don't notice it as long as you are breathing, 
but cut it off and you suffocate at once. 
  Everything "hangs" on these battalions--the launches of the 
rockets, the well-being of the test personnel and their 
families, the normal life of the city of Leninsk, the launch 
pads--you can't list them all. The main incentive for their 
personnel is not to get chewed out by their superior officers. 
  Imagine Baykonur in the forty-degree heat without water. It 
is not for nothing that they say in the water battalion that 
they pump the blood through the arteries of the cosmodrome. And 
there is no exaggeration there. It is in fact the life's blood 
of Baykonur. 
  The sergeants and soldiers have recently been receiving, for 
these heavy labors, pay that is 200--300 times less than that of 
their civilian colleagues. 
  But weather and climatic calamities remain the most terrible 
of all for the support battalions. 
  July of 1988. The winds around the main substation of the 
cosmodrome seemed enough to blow all of Kazakhstan away. The 
wind speeds were more than forty meters a second, lightning was 
flashing constantly, the peals of thunder were rocking the broad 
expanse of the steppe. The hurricane winds, in a wild dance, 
even bent, twisted, broke off and twisted into a "ram's horn" 
the huge and strong towers for the electric-power lines as if 
they were made of nothing. The roofs of substation buildings 
were torn off, and windows and doors were knocked out. Powerful 
concrete towers were toppled like matches. I and German 
Stepanovich Titov, at the time the first deputy chief of the 
space units, got through with difficulty to the stricken 
substation so as to check out the situation at the scene. There 
was so much rain water that it poured over the door sills of the 
Volga and flooded the passenger compartment. It felt like the 
car was floating rather than driving down the concrete road. 
This was in the desert! No one would believe it. 
  The cosmodrome and city of Leninsk were left without 
electricity and water. In the disaster area they scraped up some 
vehicles and brought in the power battalion of Major S. 
Fedorenko. The battle with the natural disaster lasted almost 
the entire day. The first two towers were restored, and the city 
received a partial supply of water and light. Power was supplied 
to all the facilities on the cosmodrome after five continuous 
days of hellish labors. They slept for four or five hours right 
at the work sites, because they understood that a cosmodrome 
without power was a dead cosmodrome. Captain O. Godlevskiy and 
Senior Warrant Officer P. Gonzilovskiy stayed up in the rebuilt 
towers of the power lines for 18 hours a day, installing 
insulator strings passed to them on the LEP-220 towers. 
  Who can say whether this was heroism or not? For me, it 
unequivocally was. And thankfully no one cursed the power 
workers. 
  A January night in 1991. I awake from a heart-rending 
wail--the safety valves had been triggered at the city's TETs 
[heat and electric-power plant], which was also serviced by the 
military. I grab one telephone--silence; a second--the same. 
Everything became clear--the TETs was "at zero." I looked at my 
watch--just after three. I open the hot-water tap--empty; the 
cold--not a drop. 
  And now I understood that the whole power system of the 
cosmodrome, and not only the TETs, was out of service. Outside, 
thank God, it was only minus five degrees. Thinking quickly, I 
saw that if power could not be fed to the pumps in 18 hours, we 
would have to pour out the water, in the most direct sense. I 
got the creeps--God forbid. 
  I ran to the TETs with the other officers. The cause of the 
accident was ascertained--a rupture in a pipe 1,200 mm in 
diameter near the 35-kV substation. The substation was flooded, 
the TETs was not operating and it was impossible to hook into 
the outside grid of the power system. And that meant that all of 
the boilers at the cosmodrome would stop in an hour, since there 
would be no water. 
  The city and the cosmodrome were sleeping and dreaming. The 
"unskilled workers" of the battalion, the hard-working 
battalions, the invisible great laborers, went into action. It 
was they who started up the diesels, put the flooded substation 
back into shape, turned on the boilers and turbines. Behind 
every pump, boiler, valve or switch there was a soldier or 
officer. It was they who "warmed" the sleeping citizenry. But by 
two o'clock in the afternoon they had already been forgotten, 
since the city was receiving water and light. A few knew that 
people were then working for another seven days straight so as 
to make everything right. 
  And what a nightmare frequently begins for the support 
battalions in the summer, when 15--20 cables suddenly burst into 
flames simultaneously owing to the two- or three-fold 
overloading in the forty-degree heat (in the shade), leaving 
150--200 homes and service buildings without electric power. 
Phone calls, insults, blow-ups by superiors, complaints from 
residents... 
  But as soon as the electric power is restored through three 
or four days of continuous labor by soldiers and officers under 
the searing sun, everything settles down again. And no one cares 
that the cables have been lying in ground permeated by salt for 
35 years, when the standard is ten, and that is under normal 
operating conditions. It is also not taken into account that the 
demands on the power system are two or three times the maximum 
possible according to the design (the city and the cosmodrome, 
after all, have grown to 100,000 people). How much grief and 
misfortune has been caused people by this rotted-through 
equipment built at some time under the "whatever's-left-over" 
principle? 
<H6>  Tragedy at the KAZ </H6>
  The end of December 1985--a year of great catastrophes. They 
affected the Baykonur cosmodrome as well. Two days before the 
new year, at the end of the day, the chief engineer of the 
oxygen-nitrogen plant [KAZ], A. Kozharov, reported that "there 
has been an explosion at the KAZ, someone has been killed, we 
are investigating." 
  I went immediately to the plant. I heard the rest of the 
report: "There was an explosion during the welding of a barrier 
in the shop. One soldier has been killed, and about thirty have 
been injured." I went into the shop, or more precisely what was 
left of it. There was enormous hole about thirty meters in 
diameter where the ceiling used to be. Chaos, a heap of 
mutilated structural elements. A terrible picture, I had never 
seen anything like it. Among the debris were the shattered 
remains of the soldier, who had been thrown by the wave of the 
explosion into the concrete ceiling, where a bloody spot was 
visible. I had never seen a human death in such a naked form. I 
felt queasy and left the shop quickly. The injured--27 officers, 
sergeants and soldiers--were already being taken off to the 
hospital by medical vehicles. That was the price of the 
explosion. A cruel price. 
  I began to look into the causes. It turned out that 
Oxyliquit--a mixture of oxygen with organic substances--had 
exploded. Long ago, back during the construction of the plant, 
the wooden framing had been left in the shop out of either haste 
or neglect. It had become a delayed-action bomb in the direct 
sense of the word. An oxygen drainage pipe ran over that 
framing, and it had seeped through the concrete into the wooden 
boards. This meant that a "bomb" had been erected. The sparks 
from the welding were enough for the tragedy to occur. The shop 
had been in operation for about 30 years--three times longer 
than planned. It had been proposed to be closed and written off 
many times. But it was producing its five tonnes of oxygen a 
day, and somebody higher up liked that; the documents for 
closing the shop were invariably returned to the cosmodrome. I 
would like to look the construction inspector in the eye who had 
"not noticed" the framing left in the concrete floor. After all, 
he knew full well, the bastard, that this was categorically 
forbidden, that is why he was assigned there, after all. 
<H6>  The Cognac of the Construction Workers </H6>
  I would like to say, for the sake of objectivity, that the 
greater portion of the blame for such tragedies should be 
assumed by the test personnel of the cosmodrome who took part in 
the servicing of various systems and equipment. Once I was 
included on a commission to accept a "Greek 
hall"--accommodations for American astronauts and guests--from 
the military construction personnel. The basic work had already 
been completed, only little things remained--a week of work and 
it could be turned over ready to go. But they wanted to turn it 
over a little sooner, and "brighten up" the bonus. The system 
for turning over facilities by construction workers is not a new 
one, but someone, to put it bluntly, was acting with a great 
deal of inventiveness. They made particular use of the "current 
moment of profound love and devotion to their dear party and the 
wise Politburo, headed by the latest true Leninist." 
  The commission gathered at one of its last sessions--matters 
were moving toward completion. We went into the "Greek hall" for 
the next session, and there were tables so covered you couldn't 
believe it. The members of the commission objected weakly--it's 
not time yet, we have to finish our work. Nothing of the kind! 
The chief of the UNR [office of the work supervisor] promptly 
poured cognac into the glasses and, ignoring the objections of 
the commission members, gave a rousing toast: "To our dear party 
and our dear Soviet government!" 
  Try not to drink and they would stick you where they had 
to--you would end up a dissident. The next toast--"To the 
General Secretary," then "To the unity of the army and the 
people," and then any document was signed without reservation. 
Since many members of the working commission were also on the 
State Commission, matters were considered closed--the "Greek 
hall" was accepted. Welcome, American astronauts. 
<H6>  How Good It Is to Be a General </H6>
  Time passed, and I progressed in the service, got a little 
older and wiser and got used to cosmodrome service, life and 
living. It was only impossible to get used to the heat or the 
cold. It got easier to endure, true, as I advanced along the 
service ladder. First I lived in a "pencil-box"--a twelve-meter 
room in a two-room apartment. Then one-, two- and three-room 
apartments. Seventeen years on the top--fifth--floor. The 
greatest torments were in the summer months. Many of the test 
personnel sent their families off to "the great land" during 
that time. 
  The main problem during those times was to somehow get some 
sleep after a difficult work day. It was hellishly stuffy in the 
apartment. Everything was hot, even the doorknobs and dishes, 
nothing was cool enough. There was one way out--cover up with a 
wet sheet and try to sleep until it dried out. It got cooler 
toward the middle of the night. We went quickly to the balcony, 
on a folding bed. Even though the mosquitoes were a problem, 
they were tolerable, you could fall asleep by three at night. 
"And in the morning, the gasoline locomotive again," as they 
sing in the well-known Baykonur song. 
  The locomotive! The great cosmodrome "hoe" in which the test 
personnel spent 10--20 percent of their lives while they were 
serving at Baykonur. The cars of the locomotives in the 1960s 
were very clean and very hot. It became cool and dirty in the 
modern cars with air conditioning. That is how scientific and 
technical progress and the decline in the cultural level and 
cultivation of the test personnel was reflected in the 
hard-working gasoline locomotive. What were the test personnel 
doing in the locomotives? Reading, playing chess and cards, 
sleeping. And arguing, arguing, arguing. About space and about 
their own difficult life, the fate of the military before and 
after pensions, universal problems and... the best recipe for 
diluting alcohol. And, of course, about women. And what 
locomotive folklore of the test personnel there was! Where are 
you, poets and writers? There are very rich, untapped strata for 
your righteous labors here. Take a look, take a ride there and 
back. You will hear more than you could write in a lifetime. 
  I was hugely lucky in my last three years of service at the 
cosmodrome--I lived, in accordance with my official position, in 
the "wooden town" built at one time for the supervisors of the 
cosmodrome. What can I say? It is correct what they say in the 
song, of course: "How good it is to be a general..." An 
excellent cottage, a garden in the yard, fruit trees and grapes. 
The temperature in the rooms was four or five degrees lower than 
in the brick houses. 
  And one wonders what kept them from building such housing 
then, at the very beginning, for all of the test personnel, and 
not just for the supervisors. Relaxing in the yard under the 
grapes for even just an hour in the evening gives you quite a 
different attitude toward the service, a different look at 
cosmodrome life. But most of the officers and soldiers still 
have to test themselves along with the rockets under the 
constant blows of the harsh climate of the Kazakh steppes, to 
which a Russian person is unaccustomed.

<F P=106> [Article by Machine Building KB [Design Bureau] imeni </F>
Academician V.P. Makeyev General Designer Igor Ivanovich 
Velichko under the rubric "Conversion of the Sector": "Swords 
Into Plowshares"] 
  [Text] An enormous quantity of weapons has been 
accumulated around the world. But detente has come, and a 
considerable portion of them have become unnecessary and subject 
to cutbacks; this includes ballistic missiles of various 
classes. Many types of them use highly toxic fuel components 
that we are not able to turn into harmless substances in large 
quantities. They could destroyed through burning in rocket 
engines attached to special installations, for example. But the 
harmful emissions and impurities would remain in the lower Earth 
atmosphere thereby. They could also be launched without 
warheads. It is difficult to monitor this process, it is true, 
and the problem of the falling stages also arises--consequently, 
with the same harmfulness. But one could also use these terrible 
weapons for peaceful purposes. Igor Ivanovich Velichko, general 
designer of the Machine Building KB [Design Bureau] imeni 
Academician V.P. Makeyev, talks about that. 
  Our KB is the lead developer of ballistic missiles for 
submarines. The collective has created all of the SLBMs 
[submarine-launched ballistic missiles] that are in service with 
the Navy today. But the times are changing, and we have begun 
the creation of research and commercial rocket and space systems 
for the conversion of our activity. The wealth of scientific, 
technological and production potential of the developers and 
manufacturers of the SLBMs, as well as the program of utilizing 
the missiles after their retrofitting into research and 
commercial launch vehicles for spacecraft, serves as the basis 
for that. 
  We are proceeding in several directions in cooperation with 
Russian enterprises and organizations, first and foremost on the 
path of the immediate utilization of all existing missiles for 
peaceful purposes--launches of the retrofitted missiles from the 
silos of operational submarines in conjunction with the Russian 
Navy. This is entirely realistic, because in accordance with the 
Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive Weapons and the 
agreement to develop it that was signed in 1992 by the 
presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States in 
Washington, a considerable quantity of missiles will be freed 
up. The modified RSM-25 (SS-N-6) in particular, which has 
received the name Zyb, launches recoverable craft on close to a 
vertical ballistic trajectory with a microgravitation level of 
10[.sup]-4[/] g and a duration of weightlessness of 17 
minutes. Zyb missiles are launched from submarines on the 
battlefields of the Northern (area of the city of Arkhangelsk) 
and Eastern (area of Kamchatka) test ranges, equipped with 
measuring instruments, search systems and for the prompt 
delivery of the descent craft that have landed. 
  It is namely the microgravitation that makes it possible to 
realize new technologies. Our KB, in conjunction with the 
Kompozit NPO [Scientific-Production Association] and the Center 
for Space Biotechnology, has developed two types of craft: 
  --a technological module weighing 450 kg, with an 
installation accommodated in it for trying out processes to 
obtain semiconductor materials with improved crystalline 
structures, superconducting alloys and other materials; 
  --a biotechnological module weighing 650 kg, to try out 
technologies for cleaning biological compounds and the 
commercial manufacture of especially pure biological and 
medicinal compounds using the method of electrophoresis. 
  We conducted the first experimental launch of the Zyb 
missile 
at the end of 1991 at the Northern Test Range of the Navy, with 
a technological module fitted with 15 ovens containing quartz 
ampules with various sets of initial materials. The chain of 
preparation, launch and recovery of the module was checked out, 
with the necessary functional conditions for the special 
technological equipment ensured. We now have the first materials 
that were manufactured under the conditions of the flight of a 
submarine-launched ballistic missile. 
  One of the samples is a silicon crystal with a high level of 
germanium doping, grown at a speed of 10 mm/minute--that is, an 
order of magnitude greater than under Earth conditions. Quick 
analysis showed that these are defect-free monocrystals, 10--30 
mm in length and on the order of 12 mm in diameter, with a 
homogeneous distribution of impurities. Samples of metals and 
alloys with new properties were also obtained. 
  The regular operations of the Zyb missiles in the interests 
of space technologies should begin in the middle of this year. 
Retrofitted RSM-40 Vysota (SS-N-8) and RSM-50 Volna (SS-N-18) 
missiles could be used for their launch from submarines, where 
necessary, to increase the time the modules are under weightless 
conditions to 30 minutes and the amount of technological 
equipment. The Bumerang and Chizh orbital recoverable craft 
created at our KB will be used in the future. They will be 
placed into orbit by more powerful missile systems, and will 
have a period of active existence of up to several dozen days. 
The Russian Space Agency (RKA) is financing and supporting the 
work on the space technologies. 
  The thrust of the work is the creation of the refitted 
Shtil-1 missile based on the RSM-54 (SS-N-23) series-produced 
missile, a commercial system for the launch of "small" 
satellites from our ground launch complex near the city of 
Arkhangelsk, which used to be used for testing combat missiles. 
The mass of a payload placed into orbit by this missile, with an 
inclination of 70 and an altitude of 500--700 km, is 
250--300 kg, with a volume of 1.5 m[.sup]3[/]. The deployment 
of a system of personal satellite communications, intended for 
the transmission of text, digital and facsimile messages using 
the principle of "subscriber--spacecraft--subscriber" or the 
method of "electronic mail," is being placed using the Shtil 
launch vehicle in 1994-95. The Uralkosmos joint-stock company, 
formed by a group of industrial enterprises in the defense 
complex, banks and organizations of potential customers, is 
engaged in the realization of this project. Launches of the 
Shtil-3N launch vehicle, which is a variation of a more profound 
modification of the series-produced RSM-54 (the warhead 
compartment and engine for the separation of the warheads have 
been replaced with a more spacious payload compartment and new 
orbital-insertion engines), could be made from the ground launch 
complex starting in 1995. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-004C-19A>           Figure </FIG>




  We consider the key element to be the development of a 
rocket 
system--the Aerokosmos project--that is accommodated on the 
An-124 and Il-76 aircraft. This system will make possible the 
efficient launch of satellites from any point in the airspace. 
The RSM-54 submarine-launched ballistic missile has been 
refitted as a commercial launch vehicle for air launching. A 
great deal of scientific research and experimental work has been 
done so far, and this project is moving into the stage of 
development of the working documentation. We feel that our KB is 
very ready for the implementation of this plan. The Aerokosmos 
joint-stock company has been formed for its realization (in 1995 
and the start of commercial operation in 1996), and agreement 
has been reached for its support on the part of the RKA. 
  The technical essence of the project is as follows. The 
missile is accommodated inside a transport aircraft on a launch 
platform in a horizontal position, and is ejected using a 
parachute system, after which it separates from the platform 
with the simultaneous ignition of the engines. The missile can 
hold a satellite up to 1,000 kg in mass in a volume of 3.5 
m[.sup]3[/] (dimensions of 1.6 meters in diameter and 2.3 
meters in length). The mass of a satellite is 500 kg when placed 
in a polar orbit of 700 km in altitude. 
  The retrofitting of the RSM-52 (SS-N-20) missiles will be 
completed in 1997, and will make it possible to put payloads of 
1,000 kg into polar orbits 800 km in altitude in a compartment 
volume of 4 m[.sup]3[/] with launch from an An-124 aircraft. 
  All of the modified SLBMs described are in the class of 
light 
launch vehicles, and serve for the launch of light payloads (up 
to one tonne) into space or the upper layers of the atmosphere. 
Research into the market for payloads has indeed shown 
substantial growth in the need for small spacecraft, including 
low-orbit communications satellites and spacecraft for the 
system of global ecological safety, among others. There could be 
a need for about 300 such satellites before the year 2000. It 
would hardly be expedient for them to be launched several at a 
time by one heavier rocket or shuttle craft, due to their lower 
efficiency, higher cost and lesser accessibility to many 
countries that do not have their own missile and space 
technology. 
  Our program, which envisages the attraction of funds from 
domestic commercial structures and foreign investors, has been 
approved by the government of the Russian Federation. A decree 
on this question was signed by President B. Yeltsin in June of 
1992. It must be said that we have a vested interest in 
attracting foreign partners, on a mutually advantageous basis, 
due to the difficulties in financing large-scale elements of the 
program using Russian domestic sources. The restrictions on the 
launch of foreign satellites in which American high technology 
is used by Russian launch vehicles must be removed as soon as 
possible for successful international collaboration in the realm 
of space research. Moreover, even though the fundamental 
opportunities for the use of strategic launch vehicles are 
inherent in the START Treaty, they must be expanded. Third 
countries in particular must be granted the right to conclude 
agreements for the use of such retrofitted Russian or American 
missiles. The Russian Federation and United States must be 
permitted to launch satellites for civilian purposes from 
mothballed military launch positions--submarines, ships, 
aircraft and from land. The restrictions on the quantity of 
retrofitted missiles and their launches would best be removed. 
  Things should be done to see that the strategic defensive 
potential being freed up begins to work in the interests of the 
world community.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Military Sciences Professor Colonel </F>
(Retired) A. Krasnov under the rubric "Air Forces Tactics: A 
Look at the Problem": "Aerial Battle at the Threshold of 
Changes"] 
  [Text] Military hardware is upgraded in the Air Forces as 
in no other branch of the armed forces, and that has a direct 
impact on the development of their tactics. It is not difficult 
to assume, however, that these two interconnected processes will 
be accomplished in the future chiefly under the influence of the 
changes that are planned in the military policy of our state and 
the significant cutbacks in the size of the Russian Air Forces. 
Domestic science will have to resolve quite a few issues in this 
regard that affect, in one way or another, all areas of the 
military arts, including questions of improving the tactics of 
aerial battle. The most important of these, in my opinion, are 
the following. 
  What enemy aircraft could our pilots encounter in 
battle? This question was as simple as could be during the 
times of grim confrontation between the Warsaw Pact and NATO: 
the tactical fighters produced by the United States and the 
Western European countries. But today we should also add to 
that... the domestic Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters, whose tactical 
flight characteristics are highly regarded by aviation 
specialists around the world. 
  China and Germany, aside from the traditional buyers (more 
than 40 nations), have been displaying an interest in these 
aircraft. The FRG is moreover ready to buy MiG-29s that are not 
right off the assembly line; the Luftwaffe would also acquire 
aircraft from combat formations, replacing the engines and 
electronics on them with newer ones. They have calculated in the 
West that it would be more advantageous to put an improved 
version of the Russian MiG into service than to labor over the 
development of the expensive EFA Eurofighter. 
  The continuing instability of the military-political climate 
in some regions, and especially the Near East, also cannot fail 
to be taken into account in this situation. Armed conflict broke 
out once more in the Persian Gulf in January, after all, with 
the active employment of aviation just as happened two years 
earlier. And who knows, perhaps soon Russian pilots will be 
taking part in peacekeeping actions by multinational forces in 
"hot spots" around the globe. They would likely then have to 
confront these same MiGs and Sukhoys... 
  The program of testing of the new-generation F-22 fighter is 
moreover approaching completion in the United States. It 
possesses, in the opinion of specialists, the highest combat 
potential of aircraft in this class that are in service today 
with the air forces of the leading air powers. Failing to 
mention the fact that the Americans will try to win the world 
market for aircraft hardware in the future through the sale of 
this aircraft is to play the ostrich, sticking one's head in the 
sand at the sign of danger. 
  The substance of the concept of the "likely adversary," as 
we 
see, is becoming more voluminous for our Air Forces, and it must 
consequently be used with a regard for new approaches to the 
tactical training of flight personnel in fighter aviation. Just 
which ones? It is still difficult to answer that question. 
  Where will the battle be waged? We have lost a 
considerable amount of space with the collapse of the Warsaw 
Pact and the withdrawal of our troops from Eastern Europe, 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The boundaries of our radar 
reconnaissance and warning of a possible air attack in some 
sectors have, as a consequence, drawn significantly closer to 
the groups of forces and important targets covered by fighters 
in some sectors. And that means that our likely adversary 
obtains a palpable advantage under these conditions. 
  It cannot be ruled out that a number of Eastern European 
countries would not act on the side of the CIS in a military 
conflict in certain situations. The United States and its allies 
in NATO are moreover able to create strike forces of troops and 
air forces in any part of the globe in a short period of time. 
Suffice it to say that the plans of the American command 
envisage the redeployment of up to 1,500 combat aircraft from 
their continent to Europe in 20 days. The possibility of an 
attack on the part of an enemy with surprise mass maneuvers thus 
increases sharply in the event of the deployment of air strike 
groups along our western borders. 
  The circumstance should also be taken into account that the 
entry into service on a mass scale of means of aerial attack 
manufactured using Stealth technology, strategic cruise missiles 
using conventional ordnance and other types of high-precision 
weaponry would lead to a significant change in their operational 
structure in operations and strikes. The latter would obviously 
not have strict time frames, and could be carried out in waves 
for a prolonged period from various directions, accompanied by 
strong electronic suppression of troop command-and-control 
systems and weapons to as much as theater depth. 
  The opportunities for the timely entry of fighters into 
battle from a status of ground alert duty and the intercept of 
an airborne enemy in the distant approaches to the targets they 
are covering are sharply restricted under those conditions. The 
sole way out of this situation, in my opinion, is transition to 
a means of waging combat operations that is in this case not 
economical--fighter airborne alert status. What else can be done? 
  How will the battle be waged? The fundamental 
rules that were devised and codified in local wars and armed 
conflicts in the last thirty years will obviously remain in 
force for the next decade as well, if not longer. 
  There would seemingly be no need in this regard to discuss 
today the upheavals in air clashes between fourth-generation 
aircraft. But let us nonetheless try and answer a question: How, 
taking into account the cutbacks in our fighter aviation, can we 
achieve the maximum realization of the combat potential of the 
Su-27M and MiG-31, which--it is no secret--will in the near 
future constitute the foundation of the aircraft inventory of 
fighter and PVO [air-defense] aviation? How can we learn, in 
other words, to fight using skill rather than numbers? We will 
proceed therein from the fact that the tactics for waging aerial 
battle by the crews of those aircraft are founded chiefly on the 
use of the "recommendations" of on-board expert systems and the 
delivery of high-precision weaponry. 
  The search for an airborne enemy by the crews of fighter 
interceptors could thus be accomplished through its preliminary 
detection by velocity, with the further tracking of several 
targets according to the ranges measured using the automatic 
selection of pulse repetition frequencies for the on-board radar 
and the depiction of symbols (corresponding to target range and 
speed) on a display in the cockpit of the interceptor. An 
on-board thermal direction finder and laser rangefinder could 
also be used for the concealed surveillance of the overall 
aerial situation. All of the subsequent measurements of range to 
the target are made using the on-board radar. 
  Assessment of the tactical situation is performed, by and 
large, by the on-board expert system. After the detection of a 
group target, for example, it establishes the quantity and place 
of each aircraft in the group and determines their affiliation 
and priority without the intervention of the pilot, after which 
all targets are ranked according to the degree of danger and the 
most dangerous are put onto the display. 
  The commander of the interceptor group must make the 
decision 
to enter into battle in the next stage. His plan could be as 
follows: having detected one or several targets, the pilots take 
up a tactically advantageous position with regard to the enemy 
and make a concealed approach to him. Each distributes the 
guided missiles on board the fighter against the targets 
assigned by the group commander, and tracks them until such time 
as his aircraft is at a distance from one of them that 
corresponds to the maximum permissible range of weapons 
delivery. It only remains to execute the missile launch and 
disengage, using vigorous maneuvers guaranteeing the safe 
evasion of possible return fire from the enemy. The group 
commander, depending on the situation and the results of the 
first attack, then either organizes another pass or assigns his 
subordinates the task of finding new targets. 
  But how, say, can battle be waged if the enemy has both a 
quantitative and a qualitative superiority? This is far from a 
rhetorical question, if one takes into account the significant 
cutbacks in the funding allocated in the Russian budget for the 
continued development of the latest models of military aircraft. 
This problem is obviously in need of serious analysis. The basis 
for it could be a consideration of the combat tasks of fighter 
aviation. 
  You will agree, whatever contemporary aviation systems it 
may 
be equipped with, that it will have to wage battle only for 
tactical supremacy in the air--that is, in a restricted area and 
in the most crucial periods of combat operations--using small 
forces, with the observance of the principles of mass and 
centralized application. 
  If the likelihood of a large-scale war against Russia 
exists, 
then it is only potentially, in the long term. But local 
military conflicts are making themselves known even today, and 
require the appropriate level of readiness of our Air Forces. It 
must therefore be taken into account, when preparing them, that 
combat operations in local conflicts, as a rule, are of a 
localized nature; there is not always a clearly outlined front 
line; and, raids of enemy aviation are possible from various and 
most unexpected directions. Fighter aviation, aside from its 
basic "classical" tasks, will have to perform a new one as well 
in this regard--supporting the redeployment of mobile forces to 
the "hot spots." But if the prevailing geopolitical situation of 
Russia, the large spaces and the poor sophistication of the 
airfield network are taken into account, then in my opinion it 
is difficult to count on efficiency in the maneuvering of 
fighter units and their concentration in the threatened areas in 
the event a military conflict breaks out. 
  Quite a few difficult-to-solve problems of this sort have 
unfortunately accumulated in the tactics of fighter aviation in 
our Air Forces, since it has gotten into a state of anabiosis, 
figuratively speaking, in its development. One unequivocal 
conclusion suggests itself here--although its basic provisions 
remain in force, the necessity would seem to have become urgent 
to expand them and bring them closer to the realities of the 
present day. At this stage, when the formulation of the military 
doctrine of Russia is approaching its conclusion, it is more 
desirable than before to devote attention to the theoretical 
elaboration and practical assimilation of questions of preparing 
and waging combat operations by its Air Forces, and first and 
foremost fighter aviation.

Search, Resolution": "The Rescue Capsule..."] 
  [Text] ...increases considerably the likelihood of 
rescue for people in accidents on land or at sea, as well as in 
natural disasters. 
  Aviation hardware is improved from year to year, but 
unfortunately it cannot yet be said that the number of accidents 
and crashes is being reduced, and people are killed every year. 
But it is not a matter of the hardware alone--natural 
catastrophes, before which people are helpless, make their 
contribution as well. But we are quite able to reduce the number 
of casualties; we need only take up the matter seriously and 
remember that the greater number of lethal instances are 
observed in the first hours after a disaster, when shock, 
confusion, disarray, serious injuries, great loss of blood and 
lack of essentials lead to irreversible consequences. Suffice it 
to recall the demise of the Admiral Nakhimov, the earthquake in 
Armenia or the tragic incident with the submarine in the bitter 
polar waters. So many casualties could have been averted if help 
had come even an hour sooner! 
  The rescuers, it is true, did not arrive on time in those 
specific cases for entirely objective reasons--the remoteness of 
the location of the catastrophe, the lack of the equipment 
necessary in such cases, damage to rail sidings and airfields. 
Only air drops of specialists and technical gear, and moreover 
immediately, could have radically altered the situation. Far 
from every specialist, unfortunately, is able to make a 
parachute jump, the more so into an unprepared area or into the 
water, in many cases in pitch darkness as well. The rescuers 
themselves could be turned into the target of rescue as well in 
bad weather conditions or on rugged terrain. One also cannot 
fail to take into account that the separate dropping of people 
and gear often leads to unjustifiably large losses of time. 
  An analysis of catastrophes and natural disasters that have 
occurred makes it possible to conclude that the effectiveness of 
first aid measures, and all aid in general, is determined by the 
following conditions: 
  --the availability of means to deliver rescue gear, 
equipment 
and rescuers to the site of the catastrophe; 
  --the presence at the site of the catastrophe of specialists 
who can provide for the effective utilization of 
emergency-rescue and medical equipment in the area of the 
catastrophe or natural disaster; 
  --the time to bring the gear into readiness for utilization. 
  These conditions are met only through the air drop of highly 
trained, first-class specialists together with the appropriate 
gear (equipment). 
  A special container for the group air drop of rescue 
specialists and the necessary gear has been developed for just 
that purpose at the Experimental Machine-Building Plant [EMZ] 
imeni V.M. Myasishchev. 
  It must be acknowledged that work on this type of descent 
apparatus had already been pursued, but not at all for the 
purposes that we are talking about. The idea of the possible 
application of this container in rescue operations appeared only 
in the middle of the 1980s, largely thanks to impending 
conversion. 
  Two versions of the apparatus were developed--one with 
uncontrolled parachute descent, and one with controlled 
parachute descent and an engine for movement in the water. 
  Several containers of the uncontrolled type have been built 
over the last seven years. They have completed the stage of 
design testing, and have been tried out in dozens of drops both 
without people and with people on board. This container is 
currently ready for series production. It is manufactured of 
duralumin, and is cylindrical in shape. The weight of one fully 
equipped is 2,300 kg [kilograms], with a carrying capacity of 
five people plus 300 kg of cargo (one tonne in the cargo 
version). The drop altitudes range from 400 to 8,000 meters. 
  The testing was conducted using An-12, Il-76, Tu-95 and 3M 
aircraft, and had positive results. The parachute system 
employed on the container is the same as the one on the Soyuz 
descent craft, and operates according to the configuration of 
forced deployment of the drogue parachute--actuation of the 
stabilizing system--deployment of the main system. A reserve 
parachute is also planned. The rated G-forces should have been 
15 when the main canopy opened; in experimental drops they 
rarely exceeded 13 (10--13). The time for operation is 0.05--0.1 
second. 
  The crew of the container is accommodated in Kazbek seats, 
the type installed in the descent craft of the Soyuz spacecraft. 
They are somewhat modified in this version, and have inflatable 
cushioning. The container is entirely airtight with an oxygen 
reserve on board for five hours, along with communications gear 
and a source of electric power. The craft is very easy to 
operate and sits low in the water, making it easy to fish people 
and various essential objects out of the water, much easier than 
from a rescue boat. The rescue module has a good stability 
reserve thanks to that low center of gravity and the presence of 
special runners. The wave crest washes over the container when 
performing operations at sea in storms of three or more, rather 
than swamping it. The container maintains its orientation, thus 
surpassing the means of sea rescue currently in existence, from 
cutters (Yersh and Gagara class) to the not-very-widespread 
ground-effect craft. 
  The design engineering of the rescue capsule allowed for 
five 
drops, but testing has shown that its durability is considerably 
greater. All of the capsules withstood use more than ten times, 
and one container was destroyed only on the 48th drop. 
  The controllable capsule is still in the development stage, 
during which a host of difficult problems will have to be 
solved--automatic controlled descent and landing on a very 
restricted site in particular. The second version of this item, 
despite the outward similarity, differs substantially, first and 
foremost in the parachute system, which can be actuated at once, 
i.e. without the use of a drogue chute and 
stabilizing system. The canopy of the main system is controlled 
either automatically or by commands from an aircraft, the ground 
or right from the descent craft. There is also a reserve 
parachute system. 
  There are four Kazbek seats installed on board, but without 
cushioning, and one heated seat. The weight of the cargo is 300 
kg in the cargo-passenger version (1,000 kg without passengers). 
A 40-horsepower engine started from a generator, even in the air 
if necessary, is planned for movement in the water. The craft 
can be in autonomous mode for no less than six hours with 
continuous operation of the engine and generator. 
  The circle of tasks that can be performed with this object 
is 
very broad. It includes first aid to the stricken or the supply 
of electric power sources, special tools, tents, foodstuffs, 
etc. in the initial stages of an air-rescue operation with the 
joint drop of people and special gear. When it is dropped in the 
cargo version, units ready for operation immediately after 
landing (compressors, certain types of medical equipment, 
heaters, firefighting gear, water-pumping modules, special 
equipment for scuba operations etc.) can be supplied. The role 
of the new rescue craft is particularly great in the delivery of 
geological parties and expeditions in remote and 
difficult-to-access regions, their supply and the performance of 
repair operations on electric-power transmission lines and trunk 
gas pipelines, as well as supplying populated areas in the event 
of natural disasters. 
  The container may also be used as a storage device, as well 
as an intermediate base during Arctic and Antarctic crossings. 
  It is difficult not to agree that the craft that have been 
developed at the EMZ imeni V.M. Myasishchev are promising and 
extremely necessary in today's unsettled times. The work, 
however, is nonetheless not proceeding as it should. There are 
problems with everything--the parachute fabric, the materials 
and constituent items, the testing. One would like to believe 
that these are temporary difficulties. Interest in obtaining 
these containers is being displayed abroad as well, where 
nothing analogous has been created.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Voynov under the rubric "Military Reform and </F>
Higher Educational Institutions": "A Union of Science and 
Practice"] 
  [Text] A prestigious delegation arrived one sunny day at 
the Kachinsk Higher Military Aviation School for Pilots [KVVAUL] 
in Volgograd. It included two-time Hero of the Soviet Union and 
Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR Lieutenant-General of Aviation 
(Retired) G. Beregovoy, RAO [Russian Academy of Sciences] 
Academician and Major-General of the Medical Service (Retired) 
V. Ponomarenko, Honored Test Pilot of the USSR V. Tsuvarev, 
writer A. Markusha, and staff members of the Institute of 
Aviation and Space Medicine (IAKM) candidates of medical 
sciences Colonel A. Vorona and Lieutenant-Colonel S. Aleshin. 
  That same day the guests visited the museum of the storied 
school, made entries in the Book of Honored Visitors, visited 
the library, where they left gifts appropriate to its purpose, 
and then met at a roundtable with cadets, flight personnel and 
the instructors and command of the KVVAUL. Far from all of those 
wishing to be invited to the discussion were so invited--only 
cadets and officers taking part in the scientific-research work 
(NIR) under the name of Banan, which has been underway at Kacha 
under the aegis of the IAKM since September of 1990. The theme 
of the work is "Elaboration of Methods for the Development and 
Evaluation of the Intellectual Capabilities of VVAUL Cadets." 
  Without going into detail, we will clarify that the 
discussion concerned a fundamentally new approach, based on 
contemporary scientific ideas and experimental data, toward the 
selection and training of future military pilots, an approach 
oriented toward the contemporary and future level of development 
of combat aircraft. Ideas of the intellect as the ability of the 
person to adapt to various situations, learn and successfully 
resolve tasks in various types of activity are at the basis of 
the Banan NIR. 
  The authors of the NIR distinguish practical and theoretical 
types of intellect, singling out three factors in the structure 
of the intellect of a practical type: logical-symbolic, 
reflecting an ability for the analytical processing of 
information; spatial, reflecting an ability for the synthesic 
processing of information; and, working memory, typifying the 
properties of the brain as a biological processor. Intellectual 
abilities (IS) are assumed to develop in the following 
directions: the formation of a high intellectual level by means 
of intellectual training; the incorporation into professional 
training of the principles of evolving training; and, the 
effective application of technical means of training (TSO). 
  The experiment has been underway at the KVVAUL since 1990. 
One of four groups of cadets--average according to initial 
data--is being trained using the IAKM techniques oriented toward 
the development of the memory, logical thinking and the ability 
to perceive information quickly. Video and audio technology were 
used in purposeful fashion with this group for the development 
of professionally important IS for the first time. 
  An IAKM--KVVAUL practical-science association was created in 
the course of the experiment. It includes instructors from the 
departments, specialists from the psycho-physiological 
laboratory, a professional-selection group and officers from the 
flight-instruction department (LMO). A special department for 
the fundamentals of flight training organized at the school 
acted as coordinator of the experiment. 
  The reporting on the stages of the Banan NIR shows positive 
results. They became the foundation for all cadets, starting 
with the incoming class of 1991, to be shifted to training 
according to the techniques recommended by IAKM. The discussion 
at the roundtable was about what this has given the cadets in 
the experimental group, how they feel and what they have 
achieved, a group that has now been transformed into a leading 
one in composition, tasks and results of training. We offer you 
a record of the discussion. 
  Candidate of Medical Sciences Lieutenant-Colonel of the 
Medical Service S. Aleshin, senior executor of the Banan 
NIR: 
  --The increase in the intellectual capabilities of the 
cadets 
in the experimental group (EG) surpassed the analogous values 
for their classmates by twenty-nine percent for the spatial 
factor and by more than nine percent for the logical-symbolic. 
The EG achieved better values of progress in studies, and had 
better characteristics of the distribution of attention, spatial 
orientation, and nervous-emotional stability in flight. The 
dual-instruction program was completed at higher quality. There 
were six times fewer cadets dismissed from flight work owing to 
poor progress in the EG than in the control group. The results 
obtained, as well as the data from prior research, made it 
possible to recommend the adoption of the techniques for 
evaluation and purposeful intellectual development into the 
training practices of the Kachinsk VVAUL. 
  Colonel G. Cherkovskiy, chief of the flight-instruction 
department of the school: 
  --The technique of flight training has remained virtually 
unchanged since the beginning of the century. The hardware and 
tactics, however, moved far ahead long ago. The IAKM 
technique--the methods of evolving training and the formation of 
a mental image of the flight using TSO before the start of 
practical flight work--is having a palpable effect. The EG 
cadets are demonstrating a clearly pronounced desire to fly. 
  The successful incorporation of the new system is being 
slowed by the lack of TSO. We would have been able to accomplish 
little without the help of IAKM. The new is being perceived 
equivocably by the flight personnel--"I will teach the way they 
taught me..." There are enemies of the innovations at the 
school. We know about that, and are dealing with it. We plan to 
conduct the centralized retraining of instructors this year. 
  Lieutenant-Colonel V. Timofeyev, squadron 
commander: 
  --Two conditions are important for success in training--a 
healthy cadet collective oriented toward flights, and 
instructors who can and are ready to teach. We felt the results 
of the work that was carried out under the Banan program in the 
training section. This was manifested first and foremost in a 
clearly pronounced motivation of the cadets for flight training, 
and in an increased mutual understanding between them and the 
instructors. The lack of contemporary TSO, meanwhile, had a 
negative impact on the results of the work. All we have in the 
regiment is a slide projector--yesterday's equipment. Modern TSO 
is vitally necessary. They took the last MiG-21 from us here as 
late as 1990. The flight training has been conducted since that 
time exclusively on L-39 aircraft. A "psychology of the subsonic 
aircraft" is being formed here regardless of our efforts. After 
the L-39, far from everyone can master the MiG-29--the 
difference is colossal. The training detachment, making use of 
all available TSO, should provide as much information as 
possible about the aircraft our graduates will be flying. 
  Major-General of Aviation V. Nabokov, chief of the 
school: 
  --Let us take a look at who is studying at Kacha today. 
About 
sixty percent of those in the first and second years are the 
children of servicemen. There are virtually no representatives 
of the peasantry or the intelligentsia. Both we and the 
scientists have something to think about there. When we were 
analyzing the results of the work in 1992, it became clear that 
the cadets were sometimes better trained than the flight 
personnel in a theoretical regard. Those who go into the 
training regiments this year will be stronger than the 
instructors in theory. But our cadets understand that only the 
instructor pilot "teaches the sky." Cases of conceit and 
conflicts on these grounds are not known to me. 
  The regiments lag the training detachment for objective 
reasons. The techniques being employed do not reach the flight 
personnel, and are being incorporated with difficulty. This is 
largely explained by the uncertainty of the status and prospects 
of the instructors, and the reduction in motivation for 
conscientious flight work. 
  Modern TSO is essential--both video and audio systems, along 
with personal computers at levels down to the squadron inclusive. 
  Last year was unusually difficult in a morale, and not only 
a 
logistical, regard. Having received the appropriate authority, I 
told the cadets frankly from the rostrum that they have no 
prospects here, let whoever wants to go out and find himself 
another place in life. Today I can state with all certainty that 
whoever wanted to leave has done so, and we will work with those 
who have remained. 
  Cadet A. Ustinov: 
  --Has the new technique helped us in the experimental group? 
The impressions are ambiguous. It is difficult to judge for 
oneself the use of a method of strong points or static slide 
films. The video films were undoubtedly of use for landing, the 
practice zone, pattern work. But the videos that were shot at 
the school are not distinguished by their high quality. They do 
not reflect the specific "nuances" that the cadet needs. The 
impression is created overall that there is some benefit from 
the technique. But I cannot speak for everyone. We are all 
different, after all... 
  Colonel V. Kryuchkin, chief of the flight safety 
service of the school: 
  --There is no need to draw far-reaching conclusions--it is 
too soon. Yes, there are some results: the EG looks better off 
than the others. But perhaps that is the result of an unstable 
dual-instruction program? Half of the cadets who were dismissed 
for lack of progress in the other squadrons, by the way, could 
have stayed. The question of dismissal was resolved personally 
at the highest level for each cadet in the experimental 
squadron. Who else could boast of such attention? No one. I 
would have let go just one of the three who were dismissed from 
the experimental group, by the way. The Banan program must be 
continued and improved. The image of the flight on the basis of 
a homemade video film gave cadet Ustinov from ten to fifteen 
percent harmful skills. And he could not have avoided them until 
he was looked after. Then he understood everything. 
  Colonel A. Shirokov, deputy chief of the school for 
personnel work: 
  --It really is too soon to draw conclusions. We urged people 
to be discharged, we repeated the lack of prospects. But today 
we are talking about a particular type of intellect 
characteristic only of the pilot, about a tendency toward flight 
work. And the fact that there is still anybody to hear it is the 
main result. Our cadets have not broken, have not despaired of 
their choice. They want to fly and learn. That, in my opinion, 
is the chief result of the NIR. 
  A few observations. The work, having in mind the NIR, is 
undoubtedly useful and necessary. But it seems to me that it is 
oversaturated with an unjustified academism, it is 
overscientific. Success is assured with more popular 
accessibility and understandability. Provided, of course, a 
system of appropriate selection and training of instructors is 
instituted. 
  Lieutenant-General of Aviation (Retired) G. Beregovoy, 
two-time Hero of the Soviet Union and Pilot-Cosmonaut of the 
USSR: 
  --They want to make Nesterovs, pilots of great prospects, 
out 
of you with the aid of the IAKM techniques, through the 
development of the intellect, through the personality of each. 
When we evaluate an aircraft today, we have the average pilot in 
mind. You will not be average if you make conscientious use of 
the opportunity you have been granted. 
  I am sometimes asked, How did you survive the war? I will 
try 
to explain. First of all, I always noticed the enemy faster than 
the escort fighters, and I targeted them myself, trying to force 
my will onto the enemy and anticipate the development of events. 
I tried to learn from the mistakes of others, and never blindly 
trusted instructions--real life is so varied that you can't 
always envisage everything. It is very important to feel the 
aircraft, to understand what is happening and what will happen 
if you do this or that. You have to think and predict the 
situation. 
  When I was shot down once, I had to land my aircraft in a 
forest. The instructions recommended using it as an underlying 
surface. I knew that a pilot had recently died in an Il-2 by 
making a forced landing in the woods according to the 
instructions. I did not want to repeat his fate, and I decided 
not to "shave" the crowns but to slash to the roots. It did not 
work out too badly. The wings and tail disappeared. But I was 
left alive! 
  A. Markusha, writer: 
  --An example for my generation was Valeriy Chkalov. It can 
be 
seen distinctly today, however, that some writers and 
commentators of the times, most likely out of opportunistic 
considerations, have created an image of a diminished intellect. 
Yes, Chkalov had no education. And so what? Chkalov was not 
simply an outstanding pilot, but also a highly gifted and 
intellectually refined individual. I have had occasion to read 
his letters. Chkalov had neat and legible handwriting, and he 
wrote without errors! 
  There is no profession in the world that would give one such 
a feeling of freedom as the flight profession. And if you have 
decided to refute slavery with all of your life, you are in the 
right place. I see the sense of life in seeing that it is not 
wretched. 
  V. Tsuvarev, honored test pilot of the USSR: 
  --It becomes clear in a detailed analysis that not one 
normal 
test pilot does or could conform to the optimal professional 
requirements and handle his duties anyway. In what way, through 
what is he able to do this? The fact is that a person who is 
very imperfect from the standpoint of the requirements of 
professional selection adapts and compensates for his 
uncorrected shortcomings, developing and improving his merits. 
The test pilot Anokhin, for example, as is well known, flew with 
one eye. What you are given is thus directed toward the 
development of those qualities that will later allow you to 
become true pilots. 
  Major-General of the Medical Service (Retired) V. 
Ponomarenko, Academician of the RAO and scientific supervisor of 
the Banan NIR: 
  --You have met with some prominent people today. Understand 
that you are future military pilots. And the pilots are the 
flower of the nation, the bearers of the traditions of good, 
decency and culture. Pilots are a special world, a special 
atmosphere. A feeling of personal dignity, not self-importance, 
can exist only in a professional. So move toward it through 
professionalism, through intellectual development. 
  The personality of the pilot starts with self-evaluation: 
where do I stand, what can I do and what can I not? You have to 
be honest to the utmost, answering these questions for your own 
self. 
  It is very important to raise the level of training of 
instructors today. An instructor who has never in his life flown 
a modern combat aircraft cannot give a cadet true purpose, and 
does not know what a MiG-29 or an Su-27 is. A higher school for 
instructors is needed. An instructional center could be created 
at the school as a start, and then a school could be opened. We 
will not be able to move forward if we do not solve this 
problem. And do not grow conceited as you are working, let 
people surround you who meet good with good... 
  * * * 
  The next day all who wished were invited to a meeting with 
the guests at the school's club. The meeting was warm, the 
climate was relaxed. And you had to see the agitation, the 
embarrassment with which the young lads in their cadet's 
epaulets brought up their record books with the addresses of 
their relatives and the telephone numbers of girls, so as to 
leave in their memory the confident stroke of the pen of 
two-time Hero of the Soviet Union and three-time pilot 
Beregovoy... There were many revelations that day that give me 
grounds to assume that Kacha will remember this visit for a long 
time. And if that is so, then it may be asserted that its aim 
was achieved. 
  Before the war, as is well known, Kacha was located in the 
Crimea near Sevastopol. There was also a branch there of the 
predecessor of the IAKM--the IAM [Institute of Aviation 
Medicine] imeni I.P. Pavlov. The school and the branch worked 
closely together to their mutual benefit. Then fate separated 
the scholars and the practitioners. The IAM has since been 
disbanded, resurrected and had "space" added to its name. And 
now they are together again--the storied school and the unique 
scientific-research institute of the Air Forces. Their 
collaboration, directed toward the future, is having results 
even today. That is indisputable. A delegation from the French 
Air Force that visited Kacha at the end of March admired the 
intellectual level of the IAKM projects that had been 
incorporated into the training program. The French frankly 
admitted that they did not yet have anything of the sort. 
  There is no need, by the way, to hold absolute the opinion 
of 
the representatives of the French Air Force. We have our own as 
well, after all--the IAKM and the KVVAUL are pursuing a 
necessary, useful and undoubtedly promising cause hand in hand.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Colonel-General of Aviation (Retired) </F>
V. Filippov under the rubric "Aviainform": "Accident of a 
`Stealth'"[.sup]1[/]] 
  [Text] The new YF-22A fighter suffered an accident on 25 
April 1992 at the U.S. Edwards Air Force Base (California) 
during plant testing. The ATF program, under which the aircraft 
was being developed to replace the F-15, was partially 
classified, but for a certain circle of specialists it was no 
secret that the work is being conducted in order to create an 
advanced tactical air-supremacy fighter. The requirements posed 
toward it are also convincing in that regard--high effectiveness 
in aerial battle outside of visual contact with the enemy, use 
in good and bad weather conditions and in day or night, and 
support for double the number of aircraft-sorties per day with a 
reduction in support personnel. The aircraft should also have 
supersonic cruising speed in non-afterburner engine operating 
mode, low detectability and the possibility of being operated 
from runways 450--600 meters long. 
  Lockheed and Northrop, with experience in the development of 
the F-117 and B-2 Stealth aircraft, were selected first for the 
realization of the project in 1986. After the first flight tests 
of the experimental aircraft (the YF-22 and YF-23) in August and 
September of 1990, however, the working design engineering for 
the pre-series-production aircraft was entrusted to Lockheed. 
The firm's product had advantages in maneuverability, 
controllability and detectability indicators. The latter quality 
was attained thanks to the fact that essentially all of the 
achievements of the Stealth technology--low-reflecting shapes, 
radio-absorbing materials and electronic-warfare gear, among 
others--were employed on the fighter. The radar signature (EPR) 
of the YF-22 in some aspects from the forward hemisphere, 
according to some assessments that leaked to the press, is about 
one percent of the EPR of the F-15. This, in the intent of the 
designers, should reduce by 5--10 times the effective range of 
missiles against it. 
  Engines with non-controllable air intakes and flat nozzles 
fitted with a system to divert the thrust vector have been 
installed on the aircraft. They develop thrust equal to roughly 
156 kN in a static afterburning mode. An excellent aircraft by 
all measures, whatever one may say. The failure that occurred, 
however, has somewhat reduced the optimism of its advocates. 
  That day, going around after a missed approach, the fighter 
unexpectedly dropped to the runway and caught fire after several 
cycles of powerful vibrations on the vertical plane. Test pilot 
Tom Morgenfeld, even though he sustained burns, was able to get 
out of the cockpit in time. 
  The precise cause of the accident has not yet been 
established, but specialists have already advanced a number of 
options. The assumption arose that changes in the magnitude and 
direction of the thrust vector in afterburner mode of engine 
operation could occur. Such a situation had not been studied 
before. 
  U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General McPeak holds a 
different opinion. Insofar as it was established in the initial 
stages of study that the stabilizer of the YF-22A has larger 
angles of deflection when the landing gear is down than when it 
is up, it is namely for that reason that the electronic control 
system should be subjected to careful checking. General McPeak 
at the same time does not conceal the difficulties in 
determining the cause of the accident, owing to the destruction 
of a considerable portion of the aircraft during the half-hour 
fire. The flight data recorders and the data of telemetric 
measurements, all of which remained intact, save the situation. 
  It has been established that the vibrations of the aircraft 
on the vertical plane began after the pilot, when going around, 
turned on the afterburner and retracted the landing gear. 
Significant vibrations in the stabilizer, typical of the 
unsteady operation of the electronic control system, were 
recorded at that time. The deflection of the nose of the 
aircraft from the trim position reached 20 upward and 
5 downward for obviously that reason as well. The landing 
was also at an angle of attack greater than that allowed. 
  Specialists have determined that the speed of the fighter 
was 
within allowable limits, and no signs of a separation of the 
airflow on the wing were observed. 
  Many, however, feel that the possibility cannot be dismissed 
of the consequences of flaws or specific features of the 
behavior of the aircraft that had simply not been studied in 
this stage of testing. Turning on the afterburner in conjunction 
with controlling the thrust vector, for example, had only been 
done before at high altitude and, naturally, not during the 
process of retracting the landing gear. The possibility of the 
appearance of aircraft rocking owing to the imprecise actions of 
the pilot with the control stick, which on the YF-22 is mounted 
on a side panel and has a range of motion of just three quarters 
of an inch form the neutral position, had not been checked out. 
  Answers to all of these questions would seemingly be 
provided 
by more profound study, both of this particular incident and by 
further testing of the undoubtedly successful craft. As for this 
particular copy, it is not subject to restoration, since 20--25 
percent of its structural elements were destroyed by fire. 
  The report of the U.S. Defense Department that this accident 
will not entail serious delays in the deadlines for the 
completion of testing sounds entirely justified. More than three 
quarters of the planned program of test flights had already been 
made successfully before it happened, after all, and the 
characteristics of the aeroelasticity of the aircraft had been 
obtained and the interference of the weapons systems had even 
been measured. Data had been obtained even earlier regarding 
vibration and acoustic loads on a special aircraft. 
  The second of the two YF-22 aircraft built, however, is 
evidently not suited for flights, and the flight testing will be 
able to be renewed only after the building of an experimental 
F-22 in 1995.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Levin under the rubric "Information for </F>
Reflection": "High-Altitude High-Speed Reconnaissance Aircraft"] 
  [Text] The need for the guaranteed receipt of 
reconnaissance information in depth on enemy territory covered 
by powerful contemporary PVO [air-defense] systems forced the 
aviation designers in the USSR and the United States, in the 
second half of the 1950s, to turn to the idea of creating 
high-speed and high-altitude aircraft that combined good flight 
performance characteristics with reduced radar detectability. 
The American series-produced Lockheed SR-71 and the Soviet 
experimental RSR were such aircraft. 
<H6>  RSR </H6>
  Versions. NM-1 (1959)--experimental analogue 
aircraft. 
  Crew. One. 
  Dimensions. Wingspan (along outer lateral surfaces 
of engines) 10.36 meters, area 58.4 m[.sup]2[/], wing sweep 
angle at leading edge 58, length of fuselage 28 meters. 
  Mass. Maximum takeoff mass 21,000 kg [kilograms], 
landing 9,200 kg, fuel (kerosene and propane) 12,000 kg. 
  Flight characteristics. Top speed 3,000 km/hr; 
operational ceiling (at Mach 2.65) 26.7 km, dynamic ceiling 42 
km; flight range at altitude of 20 km at greater than Mach 2, 
3,760 km; landing speed 245 km/hr; landing runout 1,200 meters; 
maximum operational G-forces 2.5. The aircraft was expected to 
be able to be operated from class two airfields. 
  Engines. D-21 TRDDs [turbojet bypass engines] 
(developed by OKB-19 [Experimental Design Bureau-19] of P. 
Solovyev, 2 x 4,500--5,000 kgf in takeoff mode and 2,200 kgf in 
cruising mode). 
  Equipment. Radar sight with photo attachment 
(surveillance range up to 250 km against area targets), 
electronic reconnaissance set, photographic gear, including two 
aerial cameras with focal length of 1,000 mm and two with focal 
length of 200 mm, or one with a focal length of 1,800 mm and two 
with a focal length of 200 mm, optical sight, radar-illumination 
warning set, active and passive jamming gear, inertial-celestial 
navigation system, vertical gyro, autopilot and heading system. 
  Design features. Bicycle type landing gear. The 
presence of a braking chute was planned. 
  The airframe skin was made of D-16T and D-20 aluminum alloys 
and aluminum-beryllium alloy. 
  Additional information. Vigorous and extremely 
successful work was launched in the USSR in the 1950s on 
high-speed, high-altitude aircraft in various classes. The OKBs 
of S. Lavochkin and V. Myasishchev were creating the Burya and 
Buran unmanned cruise aircraft, designed for intercontinental 
flight and equipped with cruising PVRDs [ramjet engines] with 
acceleration to cruising speed of Mach 3 in a vertical launch 
from the ground using liquid-fueled rocket booster engines. Work 
was underway on similar topics at other OKBs as well. 
  The development of a plan for a manned, supersonic 
long-range 
bomber and jet-powered reconnaissance aircraft was underway at 
OKB-256 starting in 1955 under the leadership of P. Tsybin. The 
distinctive features of the design were the use of an air launch 
from a Tu-95N launch-platform aircraft, with subsequent 
acceleration to a cruising speed of 3,000 km/hr using two paired 
liquid-fueled booster engines and a cruising flight using two 
PVRDs. The total design range of the reconnaissance aircraft was 
12,500--13,500 km. A preliminary design of the aircraft was 
prepared in January 1956, but in 1957 the work on the 
reconnaissance aircraft was halted (one reason was the 
impossibility of achieving the design bomb load, which was a 
high-yield thermonuclear bomb). 
  The OKB-256, simultaneously with the start of work on the 
reconnaissance aircraft, prepared a proposal for the creation of 
a supersonic jet reconnaissance aircraft to conduct operational 
reconnaissance in a theater and the enemy rear. 
  A government decree was issued on 31 August 1956 for the 
creation of a high-altitude, high-speed reconnaissance aircraft, 
and on 15 January 1957 the TTT [technical-performance 
requirements] for an aircraft that received the designation RSR 
were issued. 
  The RSR, according to them, was to be the first manned 
aircraft in the world with a supersonic cruising speed. It could 
reach almost three times the speed of sound at an altitude of 
25.5 km over a target. The preliminary design for the RSR 
reconnaissance aircraft that was completed on 26 June 1957 
confirmed the practicability of achieving the design 
characteristics. The RSR could climb to an altitude of 20 km 15 
minutes after takeoff. 
  It was expected that the aircraft would pass the speed of 
sound at an altitude of 8.5 km four minutes after takeoff. The 
jettisoning of the external fuel tanks was planned at an 
altitude of 10.7 km at a speed of 420 meters/second, and after a 
gain in altitude prolonged flight would occur at high supersonic 
speeds. 
  The RSR was to maintain radio and radar silence during the 
flight. Attention was devoted during its creation to providing 
for a small radar signature through the use of the appropriate 
shapes for the airframe surfaces and the use of radio-absorbing 
skin coatings (one of the first attempts at reducing radar 
detectability). The execution of a brief maneuver with G-forces 
up to 2.5 was also envisaged in order to evade missiles (a zoom 
with a dynamic ceiling of 42 km), along with the use of active 
and passive jamming. 
  A manned analogue aircraft, the NM-1, was built to try out 
the design and on-board systems of the RSR; it was fitted with 
two AM-5 TRDs [turbojet engines] (2 x 2,000 kgf) and had a 
takeoff mass of nine tonnes, length of 26.5 meters and wingspan 
of 7.71 meters. The landing gear of the NM-1 had a main support 
in the form of a skid in the central part of the fuselage, and a 
takeoff trolley with two wheels that was attached to the skid. 
The first flight took place on 7 April 1959 (the test pilot was 
Amet-Khan Sultan). More than ten flights were made by the NM-1 
in all. 
  Despite the fact that the manufacture of a pilot series of 
five RSR aircraft was organized at a plant in Ulan-Ude and the 
possibility of assembling it at the Plant imeni Khrunichev in 
Moscow was studied, the OKB-256 was closed by decision of N. 
Khrushchev, and the work on the aircraft was transferred first 
to the OKB-23 of V. Myasishchev, and then to OKB-52 of V. 
Chelomey, where it was "happily" put to rest, being in 
contradiction with the principal projects of OKB-52. The series 
of RSR aircraft was actually manufactured, in the recollection 
of test pilot V. Pazhitnyy, who was working at the plant in 
Ulan-Ude at the end of the 1950s and beginning of the 1960s, but 
the delivery of engines was held up when the plant management 
received a directive to shut down the program and cut up the 
aircraft. The workers refused to destroy the fruits of own labor 
with their own hands. The management "displayed flexibility," 
and the aircraft were mothballed; three or four years later they 
were quietly taken away for scrap.

number. Equipment for strategic (encompassing an area of 259,000 
km[.sup]2[/] in one hour from an altitude of 24,400 meters) 
and conventional image reconnaissance over the battlefield; 
electro-optic (ELINT) and radio (COMINT) reconnaissance gear, 
including infrared and laser systems, short-focal-length 
panorama aerial cameras with focal length of 610 mm, long-focus 
aerial camera for lateral perspective pictures (LOROP type, lens 
with focal length of 1,680 mm, resolution of 76 cm at a range of 
96 km), EW system and aerial refueling using a telescoping boom. 
  Status. Series-produced in 1966-67 (32 aircraft 
were built, including trainers). There were two air wings with 
nine SR-71A/B aircraft each in the Strategic Air Command by the 
beginning of 1989. The decision was made to remove the aircraft 
from service that same year. The sole flying model of the SR-71A 
at the beginning of 1992 was being operated by NASA as a flying 
laboratory. 
  Additional information. Work began at the end of 
the 1950s on the creation of a new strategic reconnaissance 
aircraft intended to replace the Lockheed U-2. The principal 
requirements were for a high ceiling and high cruising speed 
(Mach 4). Since the interception of such a target was possible 
only using radar, the necessity naturally arose of reducing the 
aircraft's radar signature without altering the altitude and 
speed characteristics. 
  The firms of General Dynamics (a design for a small aircraft 
manufactured with the partial use of ceramics, fitted with PVRDs 
and launched from the air by a B-58 launch platform) and 
Lockheed, which under the leadership of K. Johnson had developed 
a design for an aircraft with a delta wing and two PVRDs, took 
part in the competition to create the new reconnaissance 
aircraft. Lockheed proposed reducing the aircraft's radar 
signature through the appropriate shape of the airframe, with 
smooth junctions between the wing and fuselage and a twin-tailed 
empennage tilted inward (the design also projected the use of 
radar-absorbing materials, but the lack of a suitable means of 
calculating the radar signatures of aircraft in the 1950s did 
not allow them to achieve any substantial reduction in radar 
detectability). 
  Lockheed was deemed the winner of the competition, and in 
1959 it was given a contract to develop the new aircraft. A 
variation of the F-12A fighter was created at the same time 
(obviously the U.S. Air Force command had a certain amount of 
unease at the time regarding the successes of the USSR in 
creating supersonic strategic aircraft). The flight of the first 
experimental F-12A took place on 26 April 1962, while the 
official demonstration for the press of this previously secret 
aircraft was organized on 1 October 1964. 
  The first flight of the reconnaissance aircraft that 
received 
the designation SR-71A took place on 22 December 1964; it went 
into series production (start of delivery in 1966) and was 
widely employed in the interests of the CIA and the U.S. Air 
Force for more than 20 years.

cosmodrome space units from 1986 through 1990, under the rubric 
"Cosmodromes: Missiles and People": "Plesetsk"] 
  [Text] July 15, 1957 is considered to be the official date 
of the creation of the northern cosmodrome. Built initially by 
military construction personnel as a scientific-research test 
range for missile technology, it gradually came to be one of the 
principal domestic cosmodromes. About 1,500 spacecraft (60 
percent of the total number) have been put into orbit from here. 
They include satellites for military, scientific and 
national-economic purposes. Located 800 km [kilometers] from 
Moscow among forests, lakes and peat bogs, the cosmodrome 
occupies an area of about 10,000 km[.sup]2[/] (120 km from 
north to south and 80 km from east to west), and is a 
complicated technical complex for the preparation and launching 
of artificial Earth satellites. 
  The choice of the location for the cosmodrome was no 
accident. Many scientific, national-economic and military 
programs require the placement of spacecraft into low polar and 
near-polar orbits. The use of launch complexes that are located 
in the higher latitudes is expedient for this purpose. The 
active portion of the flight of launch vehicles also passes over 
the lightly settled terrain of Arkhangelsk Oblast, which makes 
it simpler to provide for safety along the flight path of the 
rockets and choose the areas where the spend stages fall 
(northern Tyumen Oblast and Taymyr Peninsula). The proximity of 
the cosmodrome to the country's scientific and production 
centers was also taken into account. 
  The city of Mirnyy, not shown on many maps, is located seven 
kilometers from the Plesetsk station on the Northern Railroad. 
The test personnel live there. The population of the city and 
the residential compounds of the centers for the preparation of 
launch vehicles and spacecraft for launch varies from 40,000 to 
60,000 people. The infrastructure of Mirnyy meets all 
contemporary requirements. The city is provided with heat, 
water, electric power, foodstuffs and industrial goods mainly by 
servicemen. The sights, aside from monuments to prominent 
figures in space science, include memorials to the tragic events 
that have occurred at the cosmodrome and memorable dates on the 
occasion of the launches of the Kosmos-500, Kosmos-1000 and 
Kosmos-2000 satellites, among others. There is an 
instrument-building technical school, a branch of the Novator 
VNII [All-Union Scientific-Research Institute] of Electronic 
Machine Building and the Pero airfield. 
  There is an engineering site next to the city for the launch 
preparation of light (from 800 to 3,000 kg [kilograms]) 
spacecraft and their launch vehicles. Testing of satellites 
(aside from military ones) in the Kosmos, Interkosmos, Okean and 
Nadezhda series, among others--about 20 types of spacecraft in 
all--is conducted in the installation and testing wings. The 
stages of the Kosmos launch vehicle are also joined and tested 
here before being brought out to the launch complex. 
  There are servicing areas for each craft and launch vehicle 
with sets of ground testing equipment. The check-out processes 
are highly automated. Some spacecraft, such as the Meteor, can 
be delivered by aircraft to the Baykonur cosmodrome for launch 
into heliosynchronous orbits after they are checked out. 
  Rockets for space purposes (the rocket and spacecraft 
covered 
by a cowling) that are prepared for launch are delivered on 
transport and placement units to the launch pad located 50 km 
from Mirnyy, where they are placed on the launcher and are 
located inside a movable service tower during pre-launch 
preparations. This structure is 100 meters high, with an area of 
2,000 m[.sup]2[/] at the base and a weight of 450 tonnes. The 
tower is retracted from the rocket before launch on railroad 
tracks 12 meters apart. A spacecraft can be changed on a 
vertically positioned rocket using it, as opposed to other 
launch complexes. It also supports the normal functioning of the 
service personnel under any weather conditions and at any time 
of day. Deep enclosures are located near the launch complex, 
housing storage areas for the rocket fuel components and the 
engineering and technological preparation systems. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-005-10A>           Graphic </FIG>




  Spacecraft checked out and ready for launch by the Tsiklon 
launch vehicle are delivered from the engineering site in the 
installation and testing wing, located 40 km from the city, 
where they are joined with the rocket and transported to the 
launch complex. The mounting, hook-up of all service lines and 
pre-launch checks for these rockets are entirely automated. The 
operation of on-board and ground technological systems and units 
is monitored using an automated control system, with the 
depiction of the technological schedule on the display of the 
main operator. Manual control of the launch can be used when 
necessary. The pre-launch structures (storage areas for the 
rocket fuel components, accommodations for the ground testing 
equipment, panels and the like) provide for the complete safety 
of the personnel in launch. 
  The engineering and launch sites where medium-class launch 
vehicles and spacecraft are prepared and launched are located 
40--45 km from Mirnyy. They include four standardized launch 
complexes 10--15 km apart located on the steep bank of the small 
taiga river Yemtsa. This makes it possible to perform not only 
simultaneous pre-launch preparation, but also timely technical 
servicing and upgrading. One of their specific features is the 
fact that the gas diversion lines of the launch structures have 
been run out to the river floodlands in the interests of fire 
safety, which made their construction considerably cheaper. All 
the launch pads may be used for manned spacecraft. The Soyuz and 
Molniya launch vehicles and the spacecraft (military, Kosmos, 
Bion and Resurs series and the like) are tested in four 
installation and testing wings. Each rocket and craft has its 
own equipped servicing areas, some of which are standardized and 
suitable for the testing of both military and civilian craft. 
More than ten types of satellites may be tested in all. 
  The telemetry complex includes the Vega system of external 
trajectory measurements, two telemetry stations on the grounds 
of the cosmodrome and four along the flight path of the launch 
vehicles in the area of Vorkuta, Norilsk and Syktyvkar and on 
Novaya Zemlya. The information coming in from them is processed 
at the computer center in Mirnyy. Its capacity is such that it 
could satisfy the requirements of all of Arkhangelsk Oblast in 
the resolution of national-economic tasks. 
  The oxygen and nitrogen plant provides all the launches with 
the necessary liquefied gases. 
  The cosmodrome continues to develop. Launch and engineering 
complexes for the Zenit launch vehicle and the spacecraft 
launched by that rocket will enter service in the next few years.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Afanasyev under the rubric "Without the </F>
Secret Stamp": "`Halt the Work, Destroy the Materials'"] 
  [Text] The unprecedented aircraft, remotely 
reminiscent of the Space Shuttle, was launched in columns of 
fire and smoke on the broad rectangle of the screen--an aircraft 
with a delta wing, lifted by two powerful rocket boosters--and 
went off into the sky leaving behind a track of many kilometers. 
When the solemn sounds of the music had fallen silent and the 
movie screen lit up, the viewers applauded in concert and 
genuinely. That is how the participants in the 17th Scientific 
Readings on Space Science of 1993, among them the creators of 
the Burya intercontinental cruise missile, welcomed the news 
that the lid of secrecy had finally been removed from the object 
whose fate had been carefully concealed from the domestic and 
world community more than thirty years ago. 
  After 29 August 1949, when the USSR detonated its first 
nuclear device, the United States had to reconsider its views of 
the problem of the "big stick against the Russians." The first 
stage in strategic parity, however, was achieved only when the 
first experimental prototypes of bombers with intercontinental 
flight range appeared at the design bureaus of A. Tupolev and V. 
Myasishchev. They knew about this in the United States. 
  But taking into account the prospects for the development of 
air defenses by a potential enemy, it was necessary to create 
new and less vulnerable means of delivering nuclear weapons. The 
principal flight characteristics and look of systems that had 
the necessary range were determined in the course of research, 
and two basic ways of developing them were noted--the creation 
of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and supersonic 
winged craft. Both the former and the latter had their 
advantages and disadvantages. While it was difficult even to 
imagine the means of destroying a flying ICBM at the beginning 
of the 1950s, the vulnerability of winged craft seemed to be too 
great. Their principal defense at the time was only altitude and 
speed. The creation of ICBMs, however, required providing a very 
high weight efficiency in the design for the times, as well as 
powerful and economical engines and an accurate, autonomous 
guidance system, also not easy to do. The requirements for the 
structural elements and power plants of supersonic strategic 
bombers and intercontinental cruise missiles (MKRs) were not as 
high; experience accumulated earlier in aircraft construction 
was widely employed in their design engineering. A system of 
celestial navigation on MKRs could ensure high accuracy in 
hitting the target. The decision was made, in order to guarantee 
the safety of the country, to develop MKRs, supersonic bombers 
and ICBMs. 
  M. Keldysh was the inspiration for the idea, and the 
theoretician for the creation, of the ICBMs and MKRs. The NII-1 
[Scientific-Research Institute 1] that he headed was given the 
task of creating a theoretical-design base for the future 
systems. The Experimental Design Bureau (OKB) of S. Korolev was 
to incarnate the missile in metal. 
  A supersonic ramjet engine (SPVRD) was considered to be 
preferable for the power plant (DU) of the MKR; its operating 
efficiency reached a maximum at a constant (cruising) speed 
corresponding to Mach 3--3.5. The work on the SPVRD was advanced 
most broadly at NII-1 and the OKB headed by M. Bondaryuk. Since 
this engine operated steadily and economically only within a 
comparatively narrow range of speeds and altitudes, rocket 
boosters were required to put the MKR onto the flight trajectory 
before the start of the cruising leg. 
  The SPVRD differed from other types of jet engines in the 
simplicity of its design. It had no compressor to compress the 
air before being fed into the combustion chamber; it actually 
consisted of an air intake--diffuser in which the air flow was 
slowed, raising the pressure thereby, a combustion chamber, and 
an exhaust nozzle that transformed the potential energy of the 
hot gas into kinetic energy. 
  The guidance system determined the accuracy of warhead 
delivery. Work on celestial navigation systems apropos of cruise 
missiles was being pursued at the end of the 1940s at the 
initiative of B. Chertok at NII-88, which at that time was a 
part of the OKB of S. Korolev. The design department of I. 
Lisovich, who in 1953 developed an operating celestial 
navigation system with the necessary characteristics, was also 
created there. 
  The heat-resistant structural materials without which the 
manufacture of the MKR was impossible--titanium, high-strength 
stainless steel--as well as the technology for machining and 
welding them, were under development at VIAM [All-Union 
Scientific-Research Institute of Aviation Materials] and MVTU 
[Moscow Higher Technical School] imeni N.E. Bauman. 
  They decided first to build an experimental cruise missile 
(EKR) with a cruising speed of Mach 3 and a range of 1,300 km, 
the design for which was developed at the OKB of S. Korolev in 
1951-53, in order to check out the possibility of realizing 
supersonic cruise missiles. Like a full-scale MKR, it was to 
consist of a booster with ZhRDs [liquid-fueled rocket engines] 
(the R-11 rocket with long-term storable fuel) and a cruising 
stage with an SPVRD developed by the OKB of M. Bondaryuk. It 
should be taken into account that virtually no one, either in 
our country or abroad, had any experience in the creation of 
SPVRDs with the required characteristics. Relying on the 
comparatively modest experimental elaborations of past years and 
quite substantial scientific work in progress at the NII-1, the 
necessary engine was created in the shortest possible time and 
passed through the whole set of ground try-outs, confirming its 
design characteristics. 
  Reporting to the leadership of the USSR the completion of 
working design engineering for the EKR, representatives of the 
expert commission affirmed that the amount of research that had 
been performed was so great, while the data obtained from the 
ground testing satisfied the requirements of the customer so 
well, that the possibility existed of foregoing the completion 
of the experimental missile and its flight testing. An immediate 
move to the physical development of the MKR using the manpower 
of aviation design collectives, rather than "missile" ones, and 
the accumulated design work of the EKR was proposed. The Korolev 
OKB could concentrate all of its efforts after that on the 
creation of ICBMs, which no one had rejected either. 
  A decree came out on 20 May 1954 on the start of development 
of two parallel MKR projects, the Burya and the Buran, the 
creation of which was entrusted respectively to the OKB of S. 
Lavochkin--which at the time had experience in building 
supersonic fighters and had moved on to the new subject 
matter--and the OKB of V. Myasishchev, which was developing 
long-range supersonic bombers. The main executor of the SPVRD 
for both missiles was the OKB of M. Bondaryuk. The celestial 
navigation guidance system was being created under the 
leadership of R. Chachikyan, while the inertial guidance system 
for the operating leg of the launch boosters was under the 
leadership of G. Tolstousov. The scientific research of all 
subdivisions of the NII-1 and the corresponding departments of 
the Institute of Applied Mathematics was directed toward 
supporting the solutions of the tasks of the OKBs of Lavochkin 
and Myasishchev. 
  Soviet MKRs were designed as unmanned supersonic aircraft 
with vertical launch. The launch and reaching of cruising speed 
were expected to be accomplished using powerful boosters with 
liquid-fueled rocket engines. The booster engines of the Burya 
were developed by the OKB of A. Isayev, while those for the 
Buran came from the OKB of V. Glushko. Both, at the 
recommendation of TsAGI [Central Institute of Aerohydrodynamics 
imeni N.Ye. Zhukovskiy], were two-stage craft, with the second 
(cruising) stages fitted with SPVRDs structured according to a 
normal aircraft configuration with a delta wing, a sweep angle 
at the leading edge of 70 and a thin, supersonic profile. 
The forward portion of the cylindrical fuselage of the cruising 
stage held a supersonic diffuser with a central body, in which 
was accommodated the warhead. The air-intake duct led back to 
the tail section of the fuselage where the SPVRD was installed, 
encircled by annular fuel tanks; the fuselage ended in the SPVRD 
nozzle and X-shaped empennage with aerodynamic control surfaces. 
The system of celestial navigation and control was located in a 
cooled instrument compartment in the upper front part of the 
fuselage; its sensors were covered with a unique kind of canopy 
made of heat-resistant quartz sheets. 
  The dimensions and design execution of the individual 
systems 
and units of both MKRs were different. Since the Buran was 
designed for a larger warhead than the Burya, it had a large 
takeoff mass and thrust of both the cruising and the launch 
engines. The work of the Lavochkin OKB outstripped the plans, 
and by 1956, when the Myasishchev OKB was finishing the design 
engineering of the Buran, the first models of the Burya had 
already been created. 
  It is interesting that they were informed abroad about the 
Soviet work on the MKRs. The authors of the "International 
Handbook on Controlled Shells and Spacecraft," published in the 
United States in 1960 by F. Ordway and R. Wakeford, described in 
a great deal of detail the "large winged antipodal T-4A bomber 
under development in the USSR," and even included a drawing. The 
aircraft depicted in it resembled the Burya. They assumed that 
the Soviet projects were based on the research of German 
scientists E. Senger and I. Bredt on a super-long-range rocket 
aircraft during World War II. 
  After comprehensive ground testing of the Burya that was 
successfully completed in full, a new stage in the work started 
in July of 1957--flight testing. The first seven launches were 
to try out the initial leg of the flight of the Burya until the 
moment of booster separation; the aim of the next three flights 
was to run through the dynamics of the separation of stages and 
the ignition of the cruising stage. The second part of the 
program of flight testing envisaged flights with an operating 
cruising engine--first for a short distance, and then for a long 
one--with the actual try-out of all the units. By March of 1960 
the MKR had demonstrated the possibility of stable flight and 
the operability of all systems. The missile was launched before 
dawn in the last launch, made on December 16 of that same year, 
with the cruising flight during the daytime, which proved the 
effectiveness of the operation of the celestial navigation at 
any time of day. The planned program of flight testing had been 
completed. 
  The flights of the Burya took place at the same time as the 
flight testing of the R-7 ICBM developed by the Korolev OKB. The 
leadership of the USSR decided soon afterward to curtail the 
work on the Buran, assuming that the country could not "pull 
off" two MKR projects with similar characteristics at the same 
time. This step made the advocates of the idea of a MKR somewhat 
wary, but it did not particularly upset them--they were 
objectively justified. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-005-13A>           Graphic </FIG>




  The work on the Burya proceeded with unusual creative 
enthusiasm. Its creators understood that they were making more 
than a weapon--they were getting the last word in aviation and 
missile technology, looking to tomorrow. Against that 
background, the order of the leadership of the sector, the 
essence of which could be reduced to the following phrase, made 
a stunning impression: "Halt the work, destroy all materials..." 
  Yes, everyone could see that Korolev's "seven" had begun to 
fly successfully, but was it then worth it to drop the MKR, 
which had also fulfilled its mission? The decision was made in 
entirely unwarranted fashion, in the opinion of a number of 
specialists taking part in the Burya project. But the higher 
state leadership, after the launch of the R-7, was in a state of 
euphoria, and the Americans had curtailed their work on the 
analogous Navaho MKR by 1958 anyway. Air-defense missiles and 
interceptor fighters able to counter such MKRs effectively were 
also being developed at that time. ICBMs seemed invulnerable at 
the time. 
  Despite the rapid curtailment of the work on the MKRs, their 
results were widely utilized in the future in aviation and 
space, as well as missile, engineering. A domestic school of 
SPVRDs was actually created using the engines from the Burya and 
Buran. The engineering ideas that were verified in them were 
moreover made inherent in the designs of many ramjets installed 
in air-defense and cruise missiles that are in service to this 
day. 
  They returned to MKRs considerably later, in a new stage in 
the development of aircraft and missile technology when mobility 
and operativeness in delivery, along with low detectability and 
high accuracy, had moved to the forefront. And here the 
experience of the Burya, reflected in the mirror of contemporary 
science and technology, proved useful.

S. Baskov, experts of the Association of Practitioners of Space 
Science, under the rubric "Space Science Abroad": "The 
`Spot'--Commerce or Reconnaissance?"] 
  [Text] Space systems for Earth observation have 
traditionally been divided into civilian and military 
reconnaissance. Many countries, however, can purchase and use 
the information obtained by civilian satellites as 
reconnaissance information if they do not possess their own 
space hardware. 
  One visible example of this is the commercial application of 
the French Spot-1 remote Earth sounding satellite, equipped with 
two cameras with a resolution of 10 meters in the visible and 20 
meters in the visible and near infrared spectrums. Its first 
launch into space from the Kourou space facility into a 
heliosynchronous orbit 832 km [kilometers] high was accomplished 
by an Ariane launch vehicle in 1986. This resolution of the 
special gear makes it possible to distinguish many 
objects--roads, buildings, the dividing strips between 
agricultural lands etc., but the pictures obtained are not 
considered to be reconnaissance pictures in accordance with a 
decision by the French government. This became the pledge of 
commercial success for the firm of Spot-Image, which had 
captured half of the world market for the sale of satellite data 
as early as 1987. A broad opportunity appeared for the 
acquisition and use of photography of various sections of the 
Earth's surface, including secret military facilities and the 
areas of combat operation and weapons deployment, by 
governments, organizations and the mass media. 
  The fact that the information being disseminated could be 
used for reconnaissance purposes was not only not a secret, but 
was even vigorously advertised. Assistance was offered in some 
materials for the identification of targets outside the limits 
of accessibility of reconnaissance aircraft, including 
determination of the positions of air-defense complexes, the 
structuring of stereoscopic depictions of them and the approach 
routes to targets. It was also pointed out that high-precision 
digital models of the terrain created using the information 
obtained from the spacecraft make it possible to create 
databases for target designation for ground-attack aviation. 
  Many foreign specialists feel that the use of civilian 
remote 
Earth sounding satellites in the interests of various agencies, 
including military ones, is the sole expedient way of making 
highly efficient use of expensive space hardware. There are few 
scientifically sophisticated and very expensive reconnaissance 
systems of the American KH-11 type. The opportunity thus 
appears, to the extent of improvements in the quality of 
information from commercial satellites and reductions in the 
time between requests and the receipt of materials, for the use 
of the necessary data in a large number of fields with relevance 
to national security. The U.S. Defense Department, for example, 
spent six million dollars in 1990-91 for the procurement of 
5,000 photos from the Spot satellites from the American 
affiliate of the Spot-Image firm in Reston (Virginia). Some of 
them (data on 24 airfields in the former USSR) were employed in 
laying out routes to non-traditional destinations for the U.S. 
Air Force, to ensure the safety of flights of American C-5 and 
C-141 military-transport aircraft delivering humanitarian aid to 
our cities. 
  There were about 240 portable systems for flight support 
available to the U.S. Air Force at the beginning of 1992, which 
could be programmed for the automatic modeling of images of 
sections of terrain from any flight altitude according to the 
information from Spot. The systems compare photos from the 
spacecraft with digital geometric data on the terrain. The use 
of this technology was launched after its successful utilization 
during the war in the Persian Gulf. 
  Another interesting direction is the use of these satellites 
for monitoring in the interests of maintaining peace and 
international security. The Carnegie Worldwide Assistance Fund 
was engaged in a study of this problem in 1988. Pictures from 
the Spot and Landsat satellites and some other space systems 
were studied. It was established that the Spot apparatus made it 
possible to obtain images with high resolution that contained 
more useful information than the Landsat pictures. All bridges 
proved to be detectable in them, and measurement of the images 
made it possible to obtain such important characteristics as the 
traffic capacity of bridges. They were also able to determine 
the deployment areas of headquarters, barracks and other 
buildings, and the sites of motor-vehicle pools, airports and 
air bases. Boeing-727 aircraft were also visible in the pictures. 
  The international community, based on the results of the 
Carnegie Fund, has been discussing the possible creation (with 
the presumed participation of the United Nations) of means to 
provide for arms control in the interests of preserving peace 
and stability. The tasks that could be accomplished with the aid 
of such a space system include monitoring the observance of arms 
treaty obligations, ceasefires and troop disbanding, as well as 
supporting the efforts of popular diplomacy to defuse tense 
situations. 
  Proceeding from this, the trend toward increasing the 
resolution of the photos received remains as topical as before. 
The Spot-4 spacecraft, planned to be launched in 1995, will be 
equipped with modern HRVIR high-resolution cameras (visible and 
near and middle infrared bands). 
  The Helios satellite is presumably being developed on this 
basis in two versions--for reconnaissance in the optical band 
and for radar reconnaissance. The resolution at the ground in 
the optical band is expected to be no worse than one meter in 
surveillance from an altitude of 600--700 km. The frequency of 
observation of a system of two spacecraft should be one day. 
  Italy and Spain are taking part in the Helios project along 
with France. The first launch of the satellite is planned for 
1994, and the second in 1997. The extent to which they will be 
able to be used as commercial satellites can be judged after 
their launch.

sciences] 
  [Text] The NAVSTAR satellite radionavigation system created 
in the United States is a global system of continuous, 
all-weather navigation support to military and civilian 
consumers. NAVSTAR consists of navigational satellites; a ground 
command, control and telemetry system; and users' navigational 
gear intended for determining their position based on measured 
pseudoranges to the satellite. 
  Models of receiver gear, the design of which meets 
requirements of ground, airborne and naval users, were developed 
by the mid-1980's. Receivers (of the Collins firm) demonstrated 
the capability of determining coordinates with an accuracy to 9 
m and height to 11 m. But the level of accuracy achieved does 
not satisfy a number of military and civilian users. 
  Under an order of the U.S. Defense Department Mapping 
Agency, 
experimental, high-precision STI 5010 gear providing an accuracy 
of 10-15 m in determining coordinates in real time and 2 m over 
several hours of operation was created in the early 1970's. By 
1980 a group of organizations evolved in the United States 
interested in creating high-precision receiver gear for geodesy, 
metrology and so on. It included the Mapping Agency, National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration and U.S. Geological Survey. These 
organizations drew up an "interdepartmental coordination plan 
for using the NAVSTAR system in geodetic work," which specified 
each department's level of involvement in developing methods of 
geodetic use of the system. And already in the early 1980's 
Texas Instruments created the TI 4100 series 
navigational-geodetic apparatus (Geostar 4100 modification), 
which permitted achieving an accuracy of 10-15 m in determining 
coordinates in real time and 1 m in 4-6 hours of operation. The 
accuracy of mutual position of two points at a distance up to 
1,000 km was around 1 decimeter. The gear weighed 27.2 kg. 
  By the mid-1980's various firms had developed a large number 
of different versions of users' geodetic apparatus. A special 
place among the versions is held by receivers operating 
according to the radio interferometer principle. These devices 
permit providing a level of accuracy of one centimeter in 
determining mutual position of two or more users separated by a 
distance up to 1,000 km without using high-precision 
navigational signals. 
  Accumulated experience of using the users' geodetic 
apparatus 
as well as the achieved level of accuracy and promptness of 
determination will provide the opportunity to sharply expand the 
area of application of geodetic receivers and go beyond the 
bounds of traditional navigation. This apparatus is needed for 
installation of sophisticated engineering structures, for 
determining coordinates of aerial cameras during aerial mapping, 
and for obtaining other geodetic data (azimuths, differences of 
optometric elevations, components of the deviation of vertical 
lines, gravitational force values) necessary for supporting 
military and civilian users. 
  Heightened requirements are placed on geodetic receivers 
being manufactured under the U.S. Defense Department order. One 
is the capability for converting the coordinates obtained into 
essentially any local coordinate system serving as the basis for 
creating national maps and other cartographic products.

<F P=106> [Article by Captain 3rd Rank V. Krotov and Major Yu. Dubchik] </F>
  [Text] Foreign navies make wide use of various types of 
passive jamming systems and equipment to protect combatant ships 
against antiship missiles. Interference in the radio-frequency 
bands is created by forming clouds of metallized fibers or foil 
strips, and in the infrared band by clouds of heat sources whose 
emission intensity exceeds the thermal background of the 
defended object. 
  Packages of metallized fibers (strips) designed for 
different 
frequency bands and decoy flares are loaded into containers 
accommodated in the bodies of free-flight rockets and 
projectiles fired in a given direction and to a given range by 
multitube launchers. A large number of surface ships of the 
United States, NATO countries and a number of other states are 
equipped with the U.S. RBOC (Rapid Bloom Off-Board 
Countermeasures) and SRBOC (Super RBOC) systems developed in the 
1970's with manual or automatic control of four six-tube 
launchers of the Mk 35, Mk 135 and Mk 36 types. 
  Great Britain, the FRG, Denmark and Norway developed a 
standard modification (within the NATO framework) of the RBOC 
system called Sea Gnat. It has a relatively large response time 
(up to 10 seconds), which does not permit creating effective 
protection for a ship in the rapidly changing situation of naval 
warfare. Means for automatic processing of incoming data and for 
ensuring an essentially instantaneous system response are a 
mandatory element of modern passive jamming systems. Thus, the 
latest modifications of RBOC and SRBOC contain the CAMLAC 
(Computer Aided Master Launcher Control) computer control unit, 
which permits substantially increasing the effectiveness of ship 
protection against antiship missiles. Generalized data on 
shipboard passive jamming systems and equipment are given in the 
table.

    As a rule, launchers are located in the forward and after 
parts of the ship. They have up to 12 tubes at various angles in 
the vertical plane (sometimes in the horizontal plane), which 
ensures necessary altitude and direction of free-flight rocket 
or projectile launches for creating decoys. Mk 4, Mk 171, Mk 
182, Mk 214, Mk 216, Chaffstar and LOROC with chaff packages and 
decoy flares are the types of projectiles and free-flight 
rockets used for launchers of the RBOC, SRBOC and Sea Gnat 
systems. In addition, there are variants of comprehensive sets 
of radar and infrared means of jamming in the GEMINI unified 
projectile and special free-flight rockets with expendable 
active jamming sources. 
  Work continues on creating new types of decoys with improved 
specifications and performance characteristics. This is one of 
the basic directions for upgrading passive jamming systems. 
  The Mk 171 projectile is a pyrotechnic device containing 
packets of chaff made on a glass fiber basis with an aluminum 
coating. Foil strips (their length is commensurate with the half 
wavelength of antiship missile radar homing head signals) can 
cover the frequency bands from 2 to 20 GHz (more precise values 
are indicated in technical documentation of each lot of 
projectiles). The radar cross-section of a cloud from one 
projectile exceeds the radar cross-section of a small combatant 
by approximately 1.5-2 times. 
  The propellant and secondary charges also are within the 
projectile body. The secondary charge operates 3-4 seconds after 
launch and scatters the chaff packets. The chaff disperses under 
the effect of the oncoming air stream and forms an extended 
cloud several tens or hundreds of meters from the protected 
object. 
  The Chaffstar projectile creates a cloud with a radar 
cross-section approximately two times larger than from the Mk 
171. 
  The supply of chaff of Mk 182 and Mk 214 projectiles is 
enough to cover large-displacement ships. The area of a chaff 
cloud formed with the help of these projectiles can exceed 
20,000 m[.sup]2[/] in certain frequency bands (8-12 GHz). 
  The Mk 216 free-flight rocket and increased-range LOROC are 
used to simulate surface targets. They consist of a 
solid-propellant motor providing a maximum velocity of 270 m/sec 
and a time delay device (up to 20-25 seconds) for triggering the 
secondary charge. The place where a decoy is formed may be 
400-4,000 m from the ship. 
  Use of free-flight rockets and projectiles with decoy flares 
is based on a different principle. In addition to a propellant 
charge, the HIRAM projectile has a section with a combustible 
substance, a parachute and a float. The secondary charge is 
triggered and punctures a protective membrane 3.5-4 seconds 
after firing. The parachute opens under the effect of the air 
stream and the process of ignition of the combustible substance 
and formation of a cloud begins simultaneously, with intense 
emission in the 3-5 micron waveband. The descent rate of the 
projectile, with a chaff dispensing height of 60 m, is 2 m/sec. 
It burns around 40 seconds and may continue to burn after 
hitting the water because of the float. 
  The following modifications -- HIRAM-2, -3 and -4--are 
distinguished by greater intensity of thermal emission and an 
expanded band of coverage (8-12 microns). 
  The GEMINI combination radar/IR decoy consists of three 
sections -- two with chaff and one with the IR decoy. The 
combustion process lasts around 45 seconds. 
  All the above projectiles and free-flight rockets are of 
113-mm caliber for the Mk 33 launcher (RBOC) and 130-mm for the 
Mk 36 (SRBOC). The designation of the latter contains the prefix 
Super: Super LOROC, Super HIRAM and so on. 
  A computer, control apparatus and auxiliary equipment are 
included in the automated passive jamming system in addition to 
multitube launchers. Multitube launchers (such as in the RBOC 
system) are located on fixed platforms and contain six tubes on 
each side with fixed quadrant elevations (one each at 45 and 
75 and two each at 55 and 65). Using six launchers, 
they are oriented at angles of 30, 60 and 135 in azimuth to 
the ship's centerline. A diagram of the structure of a typical 
passive jamming system and external appearance of the launchers 
are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 ([Fig. 2 not reproduced]). 





      The system receives all information necessary for 
functioning 
from shipboard ELINT collection assets, acquisition radars, 
navigation devices and meteorological situation monitors. 
Launches are prepared and executed using the controlling 
processor (Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]) and data display 
device. Information on the ship's current coordinates, wind 
direction and velocity, and amount of rolling and pitching 
enters the system along with intelligence. Information from the 
shipboard radar and ELINT set contains data on target parameters 
(bearing, range) and the type, operating frequency and kind of 
emission of the radar homing head. It can be transmitted to the 
processor both from the automated battle management system 
central computer as well as directly from sensors. The 
controlling processor figures the optimum variant for employing 
decoys with an indication of the specific launcher, tube 
numbers, and moment and sequence of launches, and provides 
recommendations on executing a maneuver to leave an antiship 
missile impact zone. 
  The SRBOC system uses a standard, widespread 80186 processor 
with 64 kilobytes of main memory (its increase to 256 kilobytes 
is envisaged) and 16 kilobytes of on-line memory (with the 
possibility of expanding to 128 kilobytes) as a controlling 
processor. 
  The following data are needed for the controlling processor 
to perform calculations: Current number of detected target (from 
1 to 16) and its azimuth (0-360); type of homing head 
(radar, IR or combination); operating frequency band of radar 
homing head (four subbands); pulse duration (within limits of 
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 500 or more nanoseconds); ship speed 
(0-50 knots); own course (0-360); amount of roll (from -60 
to +60) and pitch (from -45 to +45); wind direction 
and velocity (0-100 knots) and information on the status of the 
launcher and other system units. Launch controls and annunciator 
panels displaying information on the type of antiship missile, 
the direction of its approach and readiness of the launcher are 
located on the controlling processor panel. 
  The control panel on the bridge duplicates the controlling 
processor's monitoring panel. The passive jamming system display 
equipment, including a screen showing the tactical situation, is 
located in the ship's combat information post. After a 
free-flight rocket or projectile with decoys is fired, its blip 
is shown on the screen relative to the antiship missile's 
movement path. Based on this information a decision can be made 
about changing the ship's course for more effective protection 
against the antiship missile. 
  There are lockers on deck near each launcher, each 
containing 
18 projectiles. 
  As a rule, passive jamming systems provide different methods 
of creating the passive jamming and also can function at the 
same time as active jammers. Data input to the computer about 
basic specifications and performance characteristics and about 
the algorithm of operation of homing heads in the inventory of 
antiship missiles are taken into account in choosing the method. 
In the target search mode the homing head of an antiship missile 
in flight emits pulses of maximum duration in which the size of 
the strobe reaches several hundred meters. With transition to a 
target tracking mode, pulses are narrowed sometimes tens of 
times and their repetition frequency sharply increases, as a 
result of which the size of the strobe decreases to tens of 
meters. This circumstance affects choice of the specific method 
of repelling an enemy attack depending on its phase (detection 
of the enemy radar emission, preparation of the antiship missile 
for launch, target search by the antiship missile homing head, 
guidance of the antiship missile to the target). 
  The first method (confusion) is effective against radars of 
enemy ships and aircraft operating in a search and target 
designation mode. The defending ship forms 5-7 decoys separated 
from each other by from 400 to 4,000 m. 
  The second method (diversion) is used basically for 
protection against a flying antiship missile before its homing 
head locks onto the target (Fig. 4). One or two decoys are 
formed 100-400 m from the ship in the homing head search sector. 
Inasmuch as the algorithm of operation of the missile homing 
head provides for lock-on and tracking of a higher-contrast 
target (with larger radar cross-section), then with 
consideration of the principle of priority, it will select the 
decoy as the target for guidance. 





      The third method (deflection) is used in the case where the 
antiship missile homing head has accomplished lock-on of the 
target and shifted to the guidance mode (Fig. 5). With this 
method, an extended concealing cloud is formed, whose edge 
envelops the protected ship (the maneuver of her departure from 
the impact zone is executed simultaneously). Inasmuch as the 
ship and chaff cloud are within limits of one strobe of the 
antiship missile homing head, then by shifting the geometric 
center of the cumulative extended target (ship and cloud) by 
several tens of meters, the missile path changes away from the 
ship. 





      There are several versions for employing a passive jamming 
system together with active means: Simultaneous placement of 
passive decoys with several active simulative jammers hindering 
the antiship missile's choice of the two targets in its search 
stage; placement of passive decoy and active jamming which 
deflects in range, ensuring the antiship missile's guidance to 
the decoy; placement of passive decoy and active concealment and 
deception jamming. This precludes the possibility of the 
antiship missile's guidance to an active shipboard jammer. 
  In the opinion of western specialists, passive jamming 
systems are an effective means of repelling antiship missile 
attacks and are characterized by a sufficient level of 
reliability, simplicity of servicing and control, possibility of 
installation on ships of any types, and relatively low cost. 
They are a mandatory element of the system of individual 
protection of surface combatants. The modular principle of 
building passive jamming systems permits constantly upgrading 
and modernizing their individual units.

  [Text] In the late 1970's the U.S. military-political 
leadership concluded there was a need to form a specially 
trained Armed Forces contingent for emergency use in areas of 
"vital national interests" with the appearance of crisis 
situations there. Formations and units assigned to it from the 
Armed Services were supposed to have high combat readiness and 
strategic and operational mobility and be capable of performing 
combat missions in any region of the world as applied to 
specific situations. That conclusion was preceded by an in-depth 
analysis of prospects for development of the world 
military-political situation, above all in areas of the Near and 
Middle East -- sources of oil production and areas strategically 
important to the United States -- and also Southeast Asia. In 
this connection, in July 1977 the U.S. Secretary of Defense 
prepared and submitted a special document to Congress entitled 
"PRM (Presidential Review Memorandum)-10." Along with an 
analysis of the world military-political situation, it contained 
a substantiation of the need for establishing a "Rapid 
Deployment Joint Task Force." 
  In the course of a thorough study and discussion of this 
problem, the U.S. Congress approved proposals submitted by the 
Secretary of Defense and decided to finance a program for 
establishing a Rapid Deployment Force, [RDF],[.sup]1[/] which 
President J. Carter announced on 1 October 1979. 
  Development of the optimum version of an RDF structure as 
well as of forms and methods of its combat employment began 
simultaneously on staffs of the Armed Services. In the first 
phase this work was headed by the Army Staff, inasmuch as it was 
believed that the ground component would play the key role in a 
future RDF. 
  Korea, the Middle East and the Persian Gulf initially were 
included in the RDF operational mission area. But important 
world events which occurred in subsequent years, including the 
Islamic revolution in Iran, beginning of the Iran-Iraq war, 
introduction of Soviet troops to Afghanistan and a sharp 
exacerbation of relations between Israel and neighboring Arab 
states forced the U.S. military-political leadership to 
partially revise the missions and geographic regions of 
responsibility of the RDF being established, while retaining its 
overall organizational development concept. Thus, in this period 
the entire Near East and Northeast Africa were included 
additionally in the RDF operational mission area. 
  In March 1980 the Defense Department officially announced 
formation of RDF Headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base [AFB] 
(Florida) and appointment of a commander in chief. Its 
operational-strategic purpose remained the same--readiness for 
emergency movement and independent operations in various regions 
of the world to defend U.S. "vital interests". 
  At that time the RDF effective combat strength numbered 
around 290,000 persons. Its basis consisted of four divisions 
(airborne, air assault, mechanized and Marine), two separate 
brigades (antitank helicopter and Marine), five tactical air 
wings, three carrier battle groups and three amphibious groups 
as well as combat and logistic support units and subunits. 
  Views on the RDF role and missions underwent certain changes 
with the Reagan Administration's arrival in power. As of 1 
October 1981 the RDF commander in chief was directly 
subordinated to the U.S. Armed Forces JCS and the RDF itself was 
redesignated the RDJTF. The commander-in-chief and staff of this 
force element were made responsible for drawing up plans for 
employing the RDF in Southwest Asia and organizing and 
conducting its operational and combat training. 
  As of 1 January 1983 the RDJTF was given the status of a 
U.S. 
Armed Forces unified command designated the unified Central 
Command -- CENTCOM (headquarters at MacDill AFB). CENTCOM's 
geographic region of responsibility was retained, but two 
strategic bomber squadrons of the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air 
Command, which existed at that time, and in 1966 also the 7th 
and 10th light infantry divisions were added to the RDF makeup. 
  In the period of reorganization of U.S. Armed Forces unified 
and specified commands in 1987, the ground, sea and air 
components of the RDF were removed from operational 
subordination of CENTCOM. At the same time a conclusion was 
drawn about the need to train RDF basic components for 
operations in essentially all regions of the world, now in 
support of commanders in chief of unified commands in forward 
areas. 
  In terms of operational structure, the U.S. Armed Forces 
presently have been placed in nine unified commands and one 
specified command (with rights of a unified command). The 
unified commands are classified according to the presence of 
geographic zones of responsibility and functional tasking, and 
all are operationally subordinate to the president through the 
secretary of defense. 
  Five unified commands perform functions of operational 
command and control of U.S. Armed Forces groupings in forward 
areas in peacetime and with the appearance of crisis situations 
there, fulfilling the key role in implementing the concept of 
U.S. "forward presence," carried out to protect U.S. national 
interests on a global and regional scale. In this connection, 
operational plans for RDF employment are drawn up by their 
staffs directly in forward areas and approved by the JCS. The 
annual report of the U.S. Secretary of Defense to Congress cites 
geographic areas of responsibility of these five unified 
commands, which include the following regions: 


    -  Atlantic Ocean area--Atlantic Ocean (west of 17 east 
longitude), Caribbean Sea, Pacific Ocean area (east of 92 
west longitude), excluding South America; 
  -  Northeast Africa and Southwest Asia, including the Persian 
Gulf, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman and Red Sea; 
  -  European area--Europe (including Eastern European countries), 
Great Britain and Ireland, Mediterranean Sea waters, a portion 
of the territory of the Near East (Israel, Lebanon, Syria) and 
the African continent (less Northeast Africa); 
  -  Pacific Ocean area--Pacific Ocean (except for waters included 
in the area of responsibility of the unified Atlantic Command), 
Indian Ocean, Japan, Korea, China and other countries of 
Southeastern Asia; 
  -  Central and South America area--Central and South America 
(excluding Mexico). 

    Territories of states of the former USSR, Canada, Mexico and 
the continental United States are not included in areas of 
responsibility of unified commands. 
  The following are primary missions of unified commands in 
forward areas: 


    -  monitoring the military-political situation, conducting 
reconnaissance, security and defense of U.S. military and 
civilian installations; 
  -  operational direction, training, and combat and logistic 
support of U.S. troops (forces stationed in their areas of 
responsibility on a permanent or temporary basis); 
  -  planning and immediate direction (in case of a crisis) of 
operational deployment and combat employment of Armed Forces 
groupings (including RDF components) and support of operational 
coordination with allied forces; 
  -  evacuating U.S. citizens from 
zones of military conflicts or natural disasters; 
  -  fulfilling functions of U.S. Armed Forces representation in 
states and international organizations within the area of 
responsibility and directing measures for giving military aid to 
friendly countries. 

    In the estimate of U.S. military experts, this geostrategic 
allocation ensures continuous monitoring of the development of 
the world military-political situation by the U.S. leadership, 
and if necessary enables influencing the situation in its own 
interests on an emergency basis by a show of military might or 
the direct use of armed forces. 
  The list of RDF functional missions was expanded 
considerably 
in the early 1990's in connection with cardinal changes in the 
world military-political situation and the beginning of 
reorganization and partial reduction of the U.S. Armed Forces. 
In accordance with a new national military strategy adopted in 
1992, the RDF began to be viewed as a "contingency force," with 
its primary specific purpose remaining unchanged. 
  During its existence, the U.S. RDF repeatedly has been 
involved in performing missions in the course of U.S. Armed 
Forces operations in forward areas. Operation Just Cause 
(Panama, 1989), Desert Shield and Desert Storm (Southwest Asia, 
1990-1991) and Restore Hope (Somalia, 1992-1993) are among the 
largest of them. 
  In 1992, during measures which began in the United States to 
implement a new national military strategy, the U.S. command 
updated RDF missions and effective combat strength and specified 
new requirements for its strategic mobility. This was covered 
widely in official U.S. Defense Department sources and in the 
U.S. military press. 
  In accordance with the "base forces" concept, which is the 
basis of U.S. Armed Forces organizational development for the 
next 5-7 years, the RDF is viewed as a special 
operational-strategic component intended for emergency response 
to possible changes in the military-political situation in 
individual regions of the world in order to protect national 
interests of the United States and its allies. Guidance 
documents emphasize that the following are primary RDF missions: 
Readiness for emergency movement to any region of the world; 
comprehensive support to allies and pro-American regimes by 
building up military presence, by a show of force, and if 
necessary also by conducting combat operations; protection 
(security and defense) and evacuation of U.S. citizens and 
installations in crisis areas. 
  Along with this, the following have been specified as new, 
additional RDF missions at the present time: Stopping 
proliferation of mass destruction weapons in Third World 
countries, combating international terrorism and the drug trade, 
and performing "peacemaking missions" along UN lines. U.S. Armed 
Forces groupings in overseas theaters are viewed as a base for 
deploying a forward echelon and then also the main body of the 
RDF. 
  An important feature of the present stage of U.S. military 
organizational development is the fact that the U.S. command 
does not view the RDF as an operational-strategic or operational 
command with a permanent makeup. A number of U.S. military 
publications emphasize that the most combat-ready, mobile units 
stationed on a permanent basis in the continental United States 
-- the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps, seven wings of the Air Force 
Tactical Air Command, and the 1st Marine Division -- are the 
basis of the RDF. 
  In the opinion of General C. Powell, Chairman of the JCS, 
this force should be oriented toward use above all in those 
areas where a permanent U.S. military presence is limited for 
political, economic or other reasons. The U.S. 
military-political leadership includes above all the Near and 
Middle East, Africa, and the Central and South American area 
among such regions. At the same time, employing the RDF in any 
other region that is strategically important to the United 
States also is not precluded. Using other Armed Forces 
components for emergency response to crisis situations in 
various regions of the world also is envisaged. 
  Thus, based on experience of military conflicts and of U.S. 
Armed Forces operations as well as a number of 
operational-strategic exercises, the following may be involved 
in operations as part of the RDF (see figure): Headquarters 3rd 
Army, XVIII Airborne Corps (six divisions), a Special Forces 
Group and two Ranger battalions of the Army; Headquarters 9th 
Air Force and ten air wings of the Air Force Tactical Air 
Command; up to three carrier battle groups and three amphibious 
groups, a Marine expeditionary division and expeditionary 
brigade, five squadrons of land-based patrol aircraft and a 
squadron of Navy depot ships. If necessary, strategic bombers 
and submarines armed with conventional weapons may be included 
in it additionally. 





      There can be a total of up to 300,000 servicemen, 700-750 
tanks, around 1,000 guns, mortars and MLRS, over 800 combat 
aircraft and up to 40 combatant ships in the RDF with this 
operational makeup. 
  Strategic deployment of the RDF in crisis areas has to be 
supported by forces of the Air Force Military Airlift Command 
and the Navy Military Sealift Command with the involvement (if 
necessary) of aircraft and vessels of civilian companies. 
  In accordance with the "base forces" concept, different 
options are envisaged for establishing and building up RDF 
groupings in centers of tension. Their makeup will be determined 
by the U.S. Armed Forces commander in chief in the strategic 
area based on the degree of threat to U.S. interests, the level 
of conflict and the minimum required number of forces and assets 
for localizing it in a short time. A buildup can be accomplished 
by movements of troops from the continental United States 
earmarked for reinforcing an Armed Forces grouping in a given 
area and by using forces and assets directly from the RDF makeup. 
  According to views of the U.S. command, features of 
physical-geographic conditions and operational preparation of 
forward areas and the diversity of possible RDF operational 
missions dictate the need for the presence in it of highly 
mobile units of diverse makeup from all the Armed Services. 
  Thus, the following are assigned to the main complement of 
Army forces and assets earmarked for operations as part of the 
RDF: Headquarters, 3rd Army (Fort McPherson, Georgia), which is 
the main body for operational command and control of the RDF 
Army component; Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps (Fort Bragg, 
North Carolina); 82nd Airborne Division (Fort Bragg); 101st Air 
Assault Division (Fort Campbell, Kentucky); 24th Mechanized 
Division (Fort Stewart, Georgia); 1st Cavalry (Armored) Division 
(Fort Hood, Texas); 7th Light Infantry Division (Fort Ord, 
California); 10th Light Infantry Division (Fort Drum, New York), 
units and subunits of field artillery, air defense, Army 
aviation, and combat and logistic support from the corps makeup, 
as well as attached units. In addition, depending on the region 
where operational missions are being performed, the RDF may 
include a Special Forces Group, Ranger subunits, and 
psychological operations, intelligence and EW, and combat and 
logistic support units. 
  Each division making up the XVIII Airborne Corps (airborne, 
air assault, light infantry, mechanized and armored) presently 
has its own table of organization structure and is earmarked for 
performing specific combat missions. But composite task forces 
of a mixed makeup may be established under certain conditions 
based on units of these divisions, reinforced by Special Forces 
and Marine subunits, as was the case in Panama and during 
Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. That approach ensures 
expansion of these units' functional missions, especially during 
operations under special conditions (on coastal axes, in a city, 
in the jungle, in a desert and so on). 
  The Army component of the RDF may have a total of 
100,000-120,000 persons, up to 650 tanks, over 800 guns, mortars 
and MLRS, over 1,500 ATGM systems, around 670 air defense 
weapons and over 1,100 helicopters (including around 540 attack 
helicopters). 
  Based on available strategic movement assets and the 
experience of deployment in the period of the Persian Gulf 
military conflict, the following strategic mobility standards 
have been established for XVIII Airborne Corps formations: A 
"light" division is airlifted to any forward zone in 12 days and 
a brigade from its makeup in 4 days; a simultaneous combination 
movement (by air and sea) of two "heavy" divisions is 
accomplished in 30 days. Deployment of XVIII Airborne Corps with 
a full complement of units of corps subordination in any 
overseas theater must be completed in 75 days. 
  U.S. experts emphasize that prepositioned stockpiles of 
weapons, military vehicles and supplies in potential conflict 
areas as well as forces and assets for supporting the 
accelerated movement of troops there are of special significance 
in questions of improving RDF strategic mobility. In connection 
with this, the U.S. military budget provides annual 
appropriations for resolving such problems. 
  The 82nd Airborne Division is considered the most 
combat-ready formation of the U.S. Army. Its units and subunits 
are intended for operations in the RDF forward echelon, and so 
the following operational standards have been established for 
them: 

  -  all personnel are assembled in 2 hours (each serviceman in 
the division is obligated to have a portable beeper constantly 
on his person); 
  -  one division brigade is on alert duty in 18-hour 
readiness for moving to any region of the world; 
  -  an airborne 
battalion is assigned by schedule from this brigade with 
readiness of its companies for movement set at 2, 4 and 6 hours 
respectively; 
  -  one division airborne company is constantly on 
alert duty at Pope AFB in 15-minute readiness (after receipt of 
a signal) for loading on C-130 military transport aircraft. 

    Special rigging subunits are attached to the division whose 
primary mission is to ensure accelerated preparation for the 
assault landing and loading of weapons and supplies into 
aircraft. 
  Essentially all division personnel have taken part in combat 
operations during various U.S. Armed Forces operations and have 
a high level of professional training. Special attention is 
attached to paratroop training. Combat subunits make parachute 
jumps weekly and division staff officers (as well as those on 
the XVIII Airborne Corps staff) do so 1-2 times a month. All 
jumps are made with personal weapons and full gear, and over 
half at night and under extreme conditions. 
  Possibilities of creating a separate light armored cavalry 
regiment as a separate unit of XVIII Airborne Corps are being 
studied. It is assumed that this unit will be the 2nd Separate 
Armored Cavalry Regiment, brought back from the FRG in 1992 and 
in a stage of reorganization at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Three 
light reconnaissance battalions, an Army aviation battalion, air 
defense battery and mortar company may make up the basis of the 
regiment's organizational structure. In addition, it will 
include a combat engineer company and NBC company as well as a 
logistic support battalion. The proposed numerical strength of 
the regiment is around 4,000. Initially it will be equipped with 
multipurpose Hummer motor vehicles and OH-58D reconnaissance 
helicopters, and in the future with light tanks, new-generation 
combat reconnaissance vehicles and Comanche helicopters being 
created. 
  The U.S. military press has mentioned repeatedly that 
strategic bomber and tactical air wings of 9th Air Force 
(Headquarters at Shaw AFB, South Carolina) are the basis of the 
RDF Air Force component. Units of different air components are 
represented in the 9th Air Force structure, which ensures its 
effective combat employment in low- and medium-intensity 
conflicts in essentially all overseas theaters. According to 
data of AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, its order of battle includes ten air 
wings: Two strategic bomber (42nd and 416th), six fighter (1st, 
31st, 33rd, 56th, 347th and 363rd) and two composite (4th and 
23rd). An option is being examined for disbanding three wings in 
the process of implementing the overall program for reducing the 
numerical and effective combat strength of the U.S. Armed Forces. 
  The 9th Air Force inventory presently includes 15 B-52 
strategic bombers, 610 F-15, F-16 and A-10 combat aircraft of 
tactical aviation, 85 KC-135 and KC-10 tanker aircraft and 50 
C-130 tactical transport aircraft. 
  The 9th Air Force organizational structure provides for 
strategic movement of RDF first echelon components to forward 
areas, their air cover in the course of operational deployment, 
and close air support in conducting operations. The question now 
being discussed about the possibility of establishing a 
composite air-land formation based on the 23rd Composite Air 
Wing and 82nd Airborne Division and capable of operating 
independently in any theaters deserves attention in this regard. 
It is proposed that the 23rd Composite Air Wing will include 
squadrons of C-130 transport aircraft (10-12), A-10 attack 
aircraft (24), F-16 tactical fighters (24), as well as combat 
support aircraft. Within a theater this wing will be able to 
carry out the airlift and landing of up to two battalions of 
82nd Airborne Division and in addition provide close air support 
of division units in performing the combat mission. 
  The U.S. command's approach to assigning forces and assets 
from the Navy to the RDF is very characteristic. It is 
determined by national naval strategy presently in effect which 
provides for the constant presence of groupings of U.S. naval 
forces in strategic regions most important to the United States 
-- in the Atlantic (Second Fleet), Mediterranean (Sixth Fleet), 
Indian Ocean and Western Pacific (Seventh Fleet), and Central 
and Eastern Pacific (Third Fleet). 
  In connection with this, the makeup of the RDF grouping 
established with the appearance of a crisis in one of the 
forward areas will include naval components which are in 
immediate proximity to the center of conflict, and if necessary 
also moved in from adjacent areas. 
  Activity of the U.S. Navy composite task force performing 
combat missions in the Persian Gulf is most indicative in this 
respect. It has been operating there since the time of the war 
against Iraq. Its makeup increased from 8 to 20 combatant ships 
in different stages of the escalation of tension in the region. 
There are 1-2 carrier battle groups and an amphibious group 
(with a Marine expeditionary battalion aboard) constantly 
present in it (by rotation). Ships of this task force took part 
in delivering air and cruise missile strikes against Iraq during 
the U.S. Armed Forces Operation Desert Sting (January 1993), and 
they delivered the missile strike against Baghdad on 26 June 
1993. 
  According to press reports, the type makeup of a carrier 
battle group may include 6-11 ships (including one carrier), 1-2 
guided missile cruisers, 2-3 guided missile destroyers and 
frigates, 1-3 destroyers and frigates and 1-2 nuclear powered 
multipurpose submarines (SSN's). The type makeup of deck-based 
aviation of a carrier battle group includes over 80 combat 
aircraft and helicopters, of which 34-40 are nuclear weapon 
platforms. 
  In some cases a missile battle group may be established and 
used instead of a carrier battle group. It can have 5-8 ships, 
including up to 2 guided missile cruisers, 3-5 destroyers and 
frigates and an SSN. Arming missile battle group ships with 
Tomahawk cruise missiles, intended for delivering precision 
strikes against shore targets and forces of surface ships, gives 
them the capability of effectively supporting ground troops 
operating on coastal axes, and in some areas performing some of 
the missions assigned to a carrier battle group. 
  A ship striking force (3-4 ships) may include a guided 
missile cruiser and 2-3 destroyers armed both with antiship 
cruise missiles as well as with Tomahawk cruise missiles for 
firing against ground targets. 
  An amphibious group, intended for moving and landing 
amphibious assault forces, includes from 3 to 8 landing ships 
for various purposes, including one helicopter carrier or 
amphibious assault ship. Under ordinary conditions, one Marine 
expeditionary battalion is accommodated aboard ships of one 
group. 
  A Marine expeditionary division with an overall numerical 
strength of up to 50,000 persons is capable of operating as part 
of the RDF both independently as well as together with naval 
ship forces, ground troops and air forces. It includes a Marine 
division, reinforcing units and subunits and an air wing. The 
Marine expeditionary division can be landed in 3-5 days on a 
beachhead up to 30 km wide and up to 40 km deep. 
  A Marine expeditionary brigade numbering 10,000-16,000 
persons consists of a regimental landing team, composite air 
group and brigade service support group. The Marine 
expeditionary brigade can be landed on a beachhead 7-10 km wide 
and up to 15 km deep, and the overall time for landing its first 
echelon is up to 3 days. 
  A Marine expeditionary battalion numbering up to 2,500 
persons includes a battalion landing team, composite helicopter 
squadron and battalion service support group. It lands on a 
beachhead 1.5 km wide and up to 5 km deep. Assault subunits of 
the battalion landing team are landed in an hour and the entire 
battalion landing team in 4-6 hours. 
  Squadrons of land-based patrol aircraft (each with eight 
P-3C 
Orions) are employed as part of the RDF both independently as 
well as in coordination with naval ship forces for conducting 
visual reconnaissance and SIGINT collection, hunting and killing 
submarines and laying mines. 
  The 1st Marine Division (Camp Pendleton, California) and 7th 
Marine Brigade (Twentynine Palms, California) are earmarked for 
operations as part of the RDF. With the appearance of a crisis 
in Southwest Asia, the forward echelon of 1st Marine Division 
and 7th Marine Brigade will be airlifted to the conflict area 
and draw weapons and military equipment from depot ships of 2nd 
Squadron based at Diego Garcia Island, in the Indian Ocean. 
Stockpiles of weapons have been established on depot ships for a 
Marine expeditionary brigade and an Army brigade, as well as 
stockpiles of supplies for supporting their operations for 30 
days. 
  In the assessments of Pentagon representatives, a priority 
direction of U.S. Armed Forces organizational development in the 
next few years will be comprehensive development of means of 
strategic movements. Within the framework of accomplishing this 
task it is planned to implement programs to create new C-17 
transport aircraft capable of delivering large combat equipment 
to combat operations areas and to outfit U.S. Air Force military 
transport aviation with them. Simultaneously, by the end of 1997 
it is planned to bring the overall number of depot ships in 
forward areas to 34 (including 13 with Marine armament and 21 
with heavy equipment for the Army). 
  U.S. military experts believe that implementation of these 
plans will permit a significant reduction in existing standards 
for strategic deployment of the RDF in overseas theaters by the 
year 2,000. 
  The U.S. command is giving heightened attention to questions 
of RDF technical outfitting and operational and combat training. 
In particular, RDF formations and units are being outfitted with 
modern weapons and vehicles and being manned by the best trained 
and most experienced servicemen, who as a rule have combat 
experience. 
  In accordance with the global direction of RDF training, 
subunits from its makeup periodically take part in operational 
measures (exercises, ground reconnaissance, inspections) in 
potential military conflict areas -- Europe, Central and South 
America, the Near and Middle East, and Africa. Integrated RDF 
exercises are held regularly in the continental United States. 
Their training background conforms to particular exacerbations 
of the military-political situation in various regions of the 
world. 
  According to foreign military press reports, despite reduced 
appropriations for military purposes, the United States 
continues to work actively to create new and modernize existing 
models of weapons, military vehicles and means of logistic 
support for troops. Thus, tests of a new tank to be supplied to 
"light" formations of the RDF presently are being conducted on a 
competitive basis. The following are the main tactical and 
technical specifications for it: Crew of four, combat weight not 
over 20 tons, air-transportability, possibility of being 
parachute-landed, armament consisting of a 105-mm gun and two 
machineguns (7.62-mm and 12.7-mm), computerized fire control 
system, and top speed of at least 70 km/hr. 
  Great importance also is attached to outfitting units and 
subunits with qualitatively new intelligence and EW assets, 
night vision devices, devices for determining coordinates, and 
highly mobile computer-based C[.sup]3[/] systems. This 
equipment is being created with consideration of requirements 
placed on the RDF such as high strategic mobility and 
probability of use in theaters of military operations with 
difficult physical-geographic conditions and poorly developed 
infrastructure. 
  The U.S. command gives special attention to questions of 
developing forms and methods of RDF combat employment. During 
1991-1992 the Army Training and Doctrine Command completed 
development of a new concept of combat employment of general 
purpose forces and their most combat-ready element, the RDF. It 
was titled "Air-Land Operations." Articles presently are being 
published in Defense Department central publications in which 
its basic provisions are being actively studied and discussed. 
  The concept represents the aggregate of U.S. Army and Air 
Force leadership views on the nature and methods of operations 
by U.S. General Purpose Forces throughout the spectrum of 
possible military conflicts and wars of modern times, and under 
special conditions of peacetime. Assessments of prospects for 
development of the world military-political situation and U.S. 
Armed Forces organizational development for the next decade as 
well as an analysis of the experience of their combat operations 
against Iraq and involvement in other local conflicts of recent 
years have been made its basis. 
  The essence of the new concept is as follows. The U.S. Armed 
Forces command proceeds from the assumption that, with the 
disintegration of the USSR, a large-scale military conflict in 
Europe with classic combat employment of large U.S. Armed Forces 
groupings is unlikely. At the same time, there is an increasing 
possibility of regional changes in the military-political 
situation in Third World countries which may create a potential 
threat to U.S. national interests. To eliminate this threat, the 
full arsenal of means must be used immediately, from political 
and economic pressure to direct armed intervention using the 
full might of the Armed Forces. 
  The RDF's role grows considerably under those conditions. It 
becomes a very important tool of the U.S. leadership for prompt 
pressure on potential enemies. It can be moved in part or in its 
main makeup to any region of the world in compressed time 
periods, with the appearance of an emergency situation there. 
  One of the chief requirements being placed on the U.S. RDF 
at 
the present time is its readiness to localize any military 
conflict back in the initial stage, in order to prevent its 
escalation and development into a large-scale armed clash 
fraught with heavy human and material losses for the United 
States. It is possible to attain this goal only with close 
interworking of the Army with the Air Force and Navy and under 
certain conditions also with U.S. allies. Based on this, future 
air-land operations in forward areas as a rule will be "joint" 
(involving different branches of the U.S. Armed Forces) and 
"combined" (involving allies). Operational groupings of forces 
will be established for their conduct. Depending on the content 
of combat missions, they may include components of tactical and 
military transport aviation, the Navy and Special Forces along 
with Army units. 
  Developers of the concept emphasize that all C[.sup]3[/]I 
systems (above all space systems), airlift and sealift assets, 
and reserves of weapons, military vehicles and logistic support 
assets prepositioned in forward areas; and if necessary 
components of regular Armed Forces and of the organized Reserve, 
should be used in support of the RDF. Their operations will be 
subordinated to a unified goal -- ensure successful conduct of 
the operation by the RDF main body in the shortest possible time 
and with minimum losses and material costs for the United States. 
  Where missions are performed by the RDF together with 
allies, 
the activity of the U.S. command should be directed toward their 
comprehensive support above all with deep interdiction of the 
enemy by air and missile strikes, but not with U.S. troops, 
which "should not substitute for or duplicate the allies without 
extreme need." 
  A fundamentally new provision in views of the U.S. Armed 
Forces command is the possibility of employing the RDF in the 
absence of a state of war (military conflict), but in the 
presence of factual preconditions for its outbreak. Such actions 
may include the following: Assisting friendly governments; 
combating international terrorism and "contingency operations," 
including freeing hostages, evacuating American citizens, 
helping to give humanitarian assistance, and fighting the drug 
trade; a show of military force; limited strikes and raiding 
(sabotage) operations; and other operational measures aimed at 
maintaining economic and social stability in U.S. interests. 
  Many foreign sources note that such aspects of the U.S. RDF 
as high combat readiness, strategic and operational mobility, 
technical outfitting, teamwork and coordination of staffs and 
troops, and a high level of professional training of all 
personnel are achieved, above all, through the U.S. 
military-political leadership's heightened attention toward RDF 
organizational development and training. According to many 
indicators, these forces are versatile and capable of operating 
in any regions of the world independently or with allies. A 
distinguishing feature of the RDF is considered to be the 
precisely adjusted system of operational-strategic command and 
control of all its components in the absence of a regular 
command and control structure. 
  In the opinion of the U.S. military-political leadership, 
existing approaches to U.S. RDF organizational development can 
ensure the presence of a powerful tool of pressure in any region 
of the world, even with a further reduction in the numerical and 
effective combat strength of the U.S. Armed Forces.

sciences] 
  [Text] The Advanced Research Projects Agency [ARPA] was 
established in 1958 and bore that name right up until 1972, when 
it was renamed DARPA (the "D" added to the initial abbreviation 
signifies Defense) to emphasize the military direction of its 
work. Direction, coordination and financing of RDT&amp;E having a 
high degree of technical risk on the one hand and promising a 
potentially very high return on the other hand became the 
mission of this Agency, which is independent within the 
framework of the Defense Department. The Agency, which is 
independent of the Armed Services, received the opportunity to 
work immediately under the direction of the highest echelons of 
the Defense Department on the most promising directions of 
science and technology, having as the primary objective the 
winning and holding of U.S. technological superiority in the 
military area and providing a timely warning of sudden 
military-technical breakthroughs on the part of the probable 
enemy. The previous name, ARPA, was returned to the Agency in 
March 1993. 
  Despite the fact that the question of transfer to the 
civilian sector and commercialization of dual-purpose 
technologies has not yet been raised in the United States, this 
organization's powerful potential was identified very quickly 
specifically in the area of developing such science-intensive 
technologies. This was facilitated above all by the Agency's 
successes in developing such important directions of science as 
computer engineering, communications equipment and new 
materials. Many authoritative U.S. specialists believe that 
positive results the country achieved in the area of information 
technologies (in which the civilian sector presently has 
significantly outstripped the military sector in a number of 
areas) are chiefly to ARPA's credit. Agency investments in 
military RDT&amp;E contributed to development of the following 
dual-purpose technologies: computer networks, artificial 
intelligence, supercomputers with parallel architecture and 
others. It also organized the first university laboratory in the 
United States for creating advanced materials, which led in 
particular to development of light, composite materials having 
the broadest spectrum of application in civilian and military 
areas. The Agency played a significant role in commercializing 
certain technologies for production of semiconductors and laser 
communication links. 
  Western specialists note that the primary RDT&amp;E task 
being 
conducted right up until recent times was to develop 
technologies needed for creating new arms. In addition, this 
RDT&amp;E supported military-technical breakthroughs in such 
areas 
as phased-array radars, air defense systems, precision weapons, 
low-signature aircraft, technical reconnaissance equipment, and 
C[.sup]3[/] systems. 
  In the opinion of the ARPA leadership, because of this 
Agency's organizational structure it functions in such a way 
that it has no analogues either in the Defense Department or in 
U.S. federal agencies. There is not a single research 
establishment in its makeup, and RDT&amp;E is conducted under 
contracts with industrial firms, universities and state 
laboratories. The Agency's authorized strength level as of the 
beginning of 1993 was 185 persons, including 109 scientists. 
  In contrast to heads of Armed Services programs, ARPA 
employees can finance RDT&amp;E in advanced areas under a 
simplified 
scheme. Each Agency program head carries on work valued at 
$10-50 million, 80 percent of which is allocated for project 
development and 20 percent can be directed toward realizing 
advanced ideas in a particular area, and the right to make the 
final decision on beginning or ending work remains fully with 
the program head. 
  As a rule, ARPA begins financing of RDT&amp;E long before it 
becomes possible to determine its feasibility. Participation 
financing of RDT&amp;E initiatives by industrial firms and 
universities is widely practiced. 
  Within the framework of the new U.S. Defense Department 
weapons acquisition policy announced in January 1992, the 
director of defense RDT&amp;E of this department received 
considerably broader powers to monitor the ARPA 
scientific-technical program. Moreover, in October 1992 the 
Deputy Secretary of Defense signed a memorandum according to 
which the above official has the right to monitor the progress 
and direction of the entire military scientific-technical 
program. In connection with this, many U.S. specialists express 
fears that such excessive centralization will have a negative 
effect on Defense Department capability to react quickly to 
achievements of S&amp;T progress. 
  ARPA has the following structure: directorate, chief 
adviser's section, special assistant's section, and ten offices 
devoted to a specific subject (basic defense research, advanced 
systems, computers, electronics, land systems, microelectronics, 
nuclear monitoring research, software and intelligent systems, 
naval engineering and special projects). 
  This Agency presently oversees a rather large number of 
projects providing for creation of new technologies in producing 
integrated circuits which will involve fundamental changes in 
the semiconductor industry; large-powered computers (in 
particular, machines already have appeared with a capability of 
10[.sup]11[/] operations per second); power sources with high 
density of stored energy having 100 times greater storage life 
than existing ones; and a number of others connected with 
development of dual-purpose technologies. 
  In November 1992 ARPA formed a consortium which set about to 
create high-resolution displays. Together with twelve of the 
largest U.S. firms, the Agency plans to make considerable 
investments in developing a new generation of flat 
high-resolution displays for use in computers, high-definition 
television and advanced weapon systems. Despite the fact that 
this technology appeared for the first time in the United 
States, at present Japan dominates the world market of flat 
displays. (Sales volume was $3.5 billion in 1992 and supposedly 
will reach $7 billion by 1995). 
  During development of the experimental X-31 fighter and a 
VTOL aircraft under ARPA direction and financing, unique 
technologies were created which are now being transferred for 
further development and subsequent use in the area of civilian 
aircraft construction. 
  Despite the ongoing reduction in the U.S. military budget, 
ARPA appropriations have risen considerably of late (see Table 
1).

    the whole, in the period from 1988 through 1993, U.S. 
Defense 
Department appropriations for RDT&amp;E dropped by 13 percent in 
constant prices, while the ARPA budget rose almost threefold 
($800 million in 1988). 
  In FY 1993 Congress increased the ARPA budget by $959 
million 
compared with what the administration requested. Approximately 
$581 million of that amount consists of supplementary 
appropriations for developing science-intensive dual-purpose 
technologies connected with realization of measures for 
conversion of the defense complex (Defense Conversion 
Initiative). The U.S. military-political leadership believes 
that this program will permit shifting from the transitional 
process of transferring technologies from the military into the 
civilian sector to full integration of the country's civilian 
and military scientific-technological bases. 
  Data on basic programs being coordinated by ARPA as well as 
on development and financing of dual-purpose technologies are

    This data illustrates the pressure Congress puts on the U.S. 
Defense Department in the direction of expanding the practice of 
joint development of dual-purpose technologies together with 
industry, universities and other federal scientific research 
organizations, instead of implementing the traditional process 
of transferring technologies into the civilian sector for their 
commercialization. 
  Initially, in 1986, Congress gave ARPA the right to organize 
joint programs with private business, conclude cooperation 
agreements and set up consortiums for conducting RDT&amp;E in 
precontract stages in developing dual-purpose technologies. 
These rights were to have been used primarily in those cases 
where it was a question of work with a vague end result. Such 
relationships with private business, universities and nonprofit 
organizations differ from the usual practice of letting 
contracts with a greater guarantee of rights of intellectual 
property of the developers of technologies (under the usual 
procedure the state simply became the owner of the developed 
technology). 
  The following is a typical example of an agreement on 
developing dual-purpose technologies concluded by ARPA with a 
private firm and of conditions set forth in it. ARPA allocated 
four million dollars to the Gazelle firm to develop high-speed 
transceivers and corresponding technologies of important 
military and civilian significance. The firm received full right 
to sell the product produced both to commercial organizations as 
well as to the state. An Agency representative became part of 
the firm's board of directors with the right of deliberative 
vote. Invested funds are returned by one of the following 
methods: Either by deducting 1-3 percent from the amount of a 
specific product's sale over 15 years, or by receiving a 
corresponding block of firm shares. If the firm should decide to 
sell technologies or rights to produce a product to a foreign 
company, ARPA retains the right to locate a domestic client. In 
case work stops for reason of the project's lack of prospect, 
the Agency gets back no less than the entire amount it invested. 
  This agreement proved successful. The firm developed and 
sold 
a considerable number of transceivers both to ARPA clients as 
well as to other government agencies. It is believed this 
practice should be expanded. 
  ARPA's work in developing dual-purpose technologies is 
evaluated as very effective. At the same time, U.S. specialists 
note that bureaucratic procedures adopted in the U.S. Defense 
Department largely interfere with fully realizing the rights 
Congress granted the Agency. The procedures for approval of 
agreements already concluded and sanctioned by Congress can last 
months. The Defense Department leadership recently transformed 
such agreements into the traditional form of contracts. The ARPA 
leadership in turn adheres to the viewpoint that the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation cannot be applied at all when it is a 
question of developing advanced technologies inasmuch as in this 
case it is very difficult to define the subject itself of 
acquisition. 
  In recent years serious differences have arisen between the 
president's administration and Congress regarding ARPA's role in 
developing dual-purpose technologies. The administration 
constantly attempted to limit its role in developing dual and 
primarily civilian-purpose technologies, but Congress would 
restore or even increase the volume of financing of such 
programs. 
  Thus, in the Defense Department budget law for fiscal year 
1993 (PL102-484), Congress directly ordered ARPA to engage in 
developing dual-purpose technologies. This document notes that 
the following is required of the Agency: 

  -  support and stimulate development of a national 
technological base serving both military as well as civilian 
purposes through use of common technologies; 
  -  direct and carry 
out basic and applied research in those areas where S&amp;T 
breakthroughs are possible and which are of great military 
significance, including advanced civilian technologies. 

    The developers of this law believe that by remaining in the 
Defense Department structure and fulfilling its new tasks, ARPA 
should assist the country's military department to implement new 
state technological policy aimed at integrating the country's 
civilian and military scientific-technological bases. 
  The question of organizing a civilian analogue of ARPA has 
been discussed widely in the United States in recent years. 
Proponents of creating such a department in the United States 
assert that it will be able to fully realize those properties 
which make the functioning of the Defense Department's ARPA so 
effective -- minimal bureaucratization and flexibility of 
organizational structure. It is presumed that the new department 
will be financed by government and private business on a parity 
(fifty-fifty) basis. Like the existing ARPA, it will have to 
rely on intellectual potential and other resources of industrial 
firms, universities and federal establishments, including state 
scientific research organizations, in its work of increasing the 
effectiveness of the innovation process in the area of 
developing and commercializing "critical technologies." 
  Opponents of creating a civilian analogue of ARPA believe 
that the existing Agency has given a sufficiently good account 
of itself in solving the problem of development and transfer of 
dual-purpose technologies, and therefore it makes no sense to 
organize a new one. Some opponents point out that one of the 
very important factors of ARPA's success is its work with a 
stable and homogeneous client. A potential client in the private 
sector is very heterogeneous and has different and quickly 
changing interests and needs, which inevitably will contribute 
to reduced effectiveness of the proposed organization's work. 
  The U.S. administration plans to remove developments of a 
number of key dual-purpose technologies from the purview of the 
Defense Department and ARPA, in particular, and transfer them 
(with corresponding appropriations) to civilian federal 
scientific research establishments. Critics of this decision 
believe that it will do considerable harm to ARPA's work and 
make it difficult for the Defense Department to use dual-purpose 
technologies developed in the private sector. Proponents of the 
proposed measures, to the contrary, point out that ARPA will not 
be able to effectively realize a portion of the programs within 
the scope of the Defense Conversion Initiative (see Table 2). 
ARPA employees also are troubled by the absence in the Agency of 
corresponding specialists of industry, who do not wish to go 
over to state establishments as a result of a substantial 
difference in pay in the private sector and government agencies. 
Presently only 20 percent of Agency employees have come from 
industry and 80 percent from state establishments. 
  Another negative point, in the opinion of opponents of a 
change in ARPA's role, is the tendency which has become apparent 
toward reduced attention given by the Agency to the support of 
basic research. In FY 1993 only $112.5 million from an overall 
budget of $2,253.2 billion were allocated for such research. 
Such a concentration of efforts on applied research and 
development of dual-purpose technologies promising a quick 
commercial return did not allow ARPA to fully organize 
long-range basic work. 
  The opposite viewpoint also exists, that an expansion in 
ARPA's role and inclusion of technologies primarily with a 
civilian orientation in its sphere of development allegedly will 
permit the Defense Department to acquire and master more easily 
what are as a rule less expensive and more reliable civilian 
technologies. 
  Certain specialists of the National Academy of Sciences 
believe that the Defense Department is not a department capable 
of elevating the level of civilian (dual) technologies, and they 
propose to create a semigovernmental civilian technologies 
corporation for this purpose. 
  As pointed out in a recent Defense Research Institute 
report, 
the greatest effect can be provided by using ARPA to build up 
scientific-technological potential and develop general-purpose 
technologies, not to develop specific technologies. This does 
not mean the Agency is incapable of performing the latter task 
but, in the opinion of authors of the report, Congress must 
restore the balance between high-risk advanced research and 
applied work.

  [Text] Foreign military specialists view army aviation as a 
means that permits sharply increasing the mobility and striking 
power of army formations and units, effectively countering enemy 
close air support helicopters and aircraft, suppressing enemy 
air defense and supporting air delivery of supply items to 
forward defense areas and to advancing formations and units. 
  Employment of reconnaissance helicopters, which detect and 
report precise coordinates of targets, is considered to be an 
important condition for successful performance of missions. On 
receiving such data, combat helicopters covertly move out to an 
attack position, quickly gain the altitude needed for detecting 
and delivering a strike against the target, execute a launch and 
immediately take cover or return to their basing areas. 
  Below are data on successive operations of a helicopter and 
on time spent (in seconds) in an attack on armored vehicles.

    To improve helicopter survivability in the zone of dense 
fire 
of ground troops' air defense weapons, the following are 
envisaged in its design: 

  -  armoring the cockpit, which permits withstanding the 
direct hit of 23-mm projectiles; 
  -  self-sealing coating of fuel 
tanks; 
  -  redundance of vital helicopter systems; 
  -  special glazing 
of crew cockpit and dulling of blades, which blocks the 
appearance of revealing glints of light; 
  -  cooling of exhaust 
gases, hampering the craft's detection by IR gear and enemy use 
of heat-seeking guided missiles. 

    The West continues to search for means of combating combat 
helicopters. First and foremost, this concerns means of 
acquisition, above all radars. A helicopter's radar 
cross-section exceeds the corresponding indicator for an 
aircraft, but its detection is hampered (especially during a 
hover for the time of launching an ATGM). The reason lies in the 
absence of any kind of significant Doppler component of a signal 
reradiated by an essentially stationary object. It is very 
difficult to discriminate such a signal against the background 
of local clutter. Therefore, NATO countries are working to 
create radars capable of detecting helicopters from the 
reflection of the sounding radio-frequency signal from main 
rotor blades (the AN/TPS-36A radar, for example). Experience 
shows that rotating metal or plastic blades form a 
characteristic and rather strong reflected signal. 
  The Doppler characteristic of the main rotor, determined by 
the number of blades and their rotation rate, is a distinctive 
"portrait" of the helicopter. Its analysis permits not only 
detecting, but also rather confidently classifying an observed 
object. Thus, the Helicapture radar developed by the Israeli 
firm Rafael permits detecting and identifying moving and 
hovering helicopters. The acquisition range is 9 km, range 
accuracy is 300 m, and azimuth accuracy 2.5. The radar 
antenna is installed on a light tripod. The radar weighs 130 kg. 
It can operate in a circular or sector scan mode and includes 
solid-state transceiver, signal processing unit, computer and 
control system. 
  The signal processing unit helps suppress parasitic 
reflections from local features and helps determine helicopter 
type. Target data are shown on the display. The letter H 
(Helicopter) lights up if the helicopter type is known and the 
letter U (Unknown) if it is not. The relatively light weight 
permits installing this radar on a motor vehicle. Radar 
operation can be controlled remotely, which provides safety for 
attendant personnel when antiradar missiles are guided to the 
radar. 
  Another Israeli firm, ELTA Electronic Industries, developed 
a 
modernized version of the EL/M-2106 radar, designated the 
EL/M-2106H. The helicopter acquisition range is 8-10 km and that 
of an aircraft with a radar cross-section of 2 m[.sup]2[/] is 
over 16 km. The radar antenna's high scan rate reduces response 
time and ensures timeliness of target designation for a SAM or 
AAA system. The new radar can have a fixed or self-propelled 
design. The latter version provides for operation in movement. 
  France is continuing further development of radars which are 
part of short-range SAM systems and AAA systems. They include 
Rodeo-2 and Rodeo-3 radars and pulse-Doppler radars functioning 
in the 2-3 GHz band. Their characteristic feature is the 
capability of simultaneously tracking two selected targets 
during a circular scan of air space. 
  The Swedish firm Ericsson is creating the HARD (Helicopter 
and Aircraft Radar Detection) radar family, which has a low 
probability of being intercepted by the enemy. Thus, its 
specialists were developing the HARD-3D LPI 3-D mobile 
low-flying target acquisition radar permitting acquisition and 
tracking both of flying as well as hovering helicopters at 
ranges of 9-10 km and of aircraft at ranges of 10-12 km with a 
probability of 0.9. The phased array radar created on a 
solid-state base operates in the 8-12 GHz band and permits 
acquisition, identification and tracking (both in place as well 
as in movement) of 12 airborne targets at altitudes up to 4,000 
m. The transmitter has a peak power of 30 watts. The HARD radar 
can be interfaced with the RBS-70 short-range SAM system or be 
part of an AAA system. 
  In the United States, the firm Lockheed-Sanders created the 
P-STAR (Portable Search and Target Acquisition Radar) 
pulse-Doppler radar intended for acquisition of low-flying 
targets, including helicopters (40-60 GHz band). Helicopters, 
including hovering ones, are acquired with the help of a special 
Doppler frequency analyzer. The main array is supplied with two 
secondary arrays supporting suppression of sidelobe 
interference, which permits acquiring targets rather 
confidently. The liquid-crystal air situation display, which is 
located up to 100 m from the antenna system, is used for 
informing the Stinger shoulder-fired SAM system team about 
low-flying aircraft or helicopters at ranges up to 20 km. The 
radar is equipped with an IFF system. 
  The French firm of Thomson-CSF created a family of 
pulse-Doppler radars, the TRS 2620 and 2621, as well as the TRS 
2630 Griffon, intended for acquiring hovering helicopters (see 
table).

    The radars operate in the 10-cm waveband. Helicopters are 
detected based on modulation of the echo signal caused by 
rotation of rotor blades and also by vibrations of the fuselage 
and main rotor hub. The frequency is changed both by a program 
and based on results of an analysis of the jamming environment. 
  The radar uses modern signal forming and processing 
equipment: Solid-state semiconductor transmitter, dual frequency 
conversion receiver, digital devices for processing the received 
signal, and a pulse compression circuit. There is a capability 
of tracking six targets with operator involvement or eight 
targets with introduction of the automatic tracking mode. 
  The radars are equipped with an IFF system which 
interrogates 
up to four targets in a 20 sector. The interrogator antenna 
is made in the form of a planar array. The TRS 2630 Griffon is 
the family's most modern version. Because a planar array is 
used, a lower radiation pattern sidelobe level is achieved: 
33-35 db for near lobes and 40 db for far lobes. The sounding 
signal represents a sequence of 17 pulses and the operating 
frequency can take on 12 values. A frequency change is possible 
with each rotation of the antenna for one or eight pulse chains 
(in accordance with the program loaded into the computer). 
  The echo signal processing gear includes a 12-channel 
Doppler 
filter. In case of intense jamming the radar can shift to a 
passive operating mode in which a special analyzer detects the 
emission source (jammer) and measures its azimuthal coordinates 
and operating parameters. Transition to the passive mode is 
possible in a limited sector. A programmed change in radar 
emission frequency is made in accordance with data of the 
jamming analyzer. 
  Two models of the TRS 2620 radar and 48 sets of the TRS 2630 
Griffon will be delivered to the French Army under a program for 
modernizing France's Samantha air defense assets. In addition, 
an order for acquisition of 22 sets of TRS 2620 radars has been 
received from the Finnish Army command and an order for eight 
from Latin American countries. 
  The question of selling this radar to South Korea in the TRS 
2630 B100 version, distinguished by increased emissive power 
(transmitter peak power will be 700 watts), is being considered. 
  In studying the problem of supplementing the radar with 
alternative information sources on rotary-wing airborne targets, 
foreign specialists arrived at the conclusion of the possibility 
of using acoustic sensors. In this case helicopter detection is 
not limited by line-of-sight conditions, flight regimes, or 
weather conditions. 
  Operation of acoustic sensors is based on the fact that each 
type of helicopter creates a specific subsonic emission whose 
characteristics depend on the speed of rotation and geometry of 
the main rotor as well as on flight speed. 
  Use of the acoustic band permits detecting helicopters at 
extremely low altitudes and considerable distances, and 
identifying them based on characteristics of acoustic vibrations 
created by helicopters of different types. Such sensors, which 
have a sound detector and computer in their makeup, can function 
at any time of day and in all weather conditions without a 
deterioration of their characteristics. 
  The Swedish firm Swetron already has developed the 
ground-based Helisearch acoustic system, which permits detecting 
a helicopter, determining direction and range to it and 
identifying the type of craft. 
  The British firm Ferranti developed a similar system, 
Picket. 
It has a microphone unit and portable signal processing and 
indication unit. The helicopter detection range is at least 6 
km, and information output on a target is updated every two 
seconds. The helicopter's azimuth, distance to it and flight 
mode (moving or hovering) light up on a panoramic display. It is 
believed that six Picket systems deployed with overlapping 
sectors of responsibility are capable of monitoring a zone with 
an area of at least 500 km[.sup]2[/]. 
  Self-propelled antiaircraft [SP AA] guns, 
distinguished by high mobility and rate of fire (up to 
3,000-6,000 rounds per minute) with a very slight reaction time 
(6-12 seconds), can be used very successfully to cover troops 
against combat helicopter strikes on the battlefield and on the 
march. They are capable of moving right in troop battle 
formations, conducting reconnaissance of the enemy in movement 
and firing from short halts. 
  SP AA gun mounts with automatic and semiautomatic laying 
systems equipped with pulse-Doppler radars, which support the 
conduct of battle against diverse airborne targets in any 
weather, around the clock and in a difficult electronic 
environment, have been developed abroad at the present time. 
They are armed with 20-40 mm guns and are capable of bringing 
fire on helicopters at ranges of 2-4 km. But this is not always 
sufficient, inasmuch as ranges at which combat helicopters 
launch ATGM's already have reached 3-4 km, and in the future 
will increase to 6-8 km. Western developers believe that 
increasing the range of fire of SP AA guns is simplest by 
switching to calibers of 57-mm, 76-mm or more. 
  Italy already has developed the Otomatic 76-mm SP AA gun 
with 
a unit of fire of 100 rounds. Fire usually is conducted in 
bursts of 4-5 rounds. The gun's fire control system includes a 
target acquisition radar with IFF device, millimeter-band 
monopulse tracking radar, opto-electronic aiming system, two 
control consoles and a digital computer. Evaluation testing 
showed that the effective range of fire of the SP AA gun is 6 km 
and reaction time is five seconds. The chassis of the Palmaria 
self-propelled howitzer was chosen as its base. The combat 
weight of the SP AA gun is 46 tonnes. 
  But experts note that an increase in caliber of antiaircraft 
guns also has negative consequences: The gun's rate of fire 
drops, the unit of fire decreases because of increased 
projectile weight, and errors occur more often in firing at long 
distances. 
  These circumstances prompted developers to seek an 
opportunity to correct the projectile's flight path in the 
target area. A solution was found by fitting it with an impulse 
correction motor consisting of six small explosive charges 
contained in the projectile body. By starting the appropriate 
motor it is possible to change the projectile's path within 
limits of 10 in any direction relative to the velocity 
vector by commands from a ground fire control system. The 
command receiver is contained in the base of the projectile, and 
its antenna, in the form of a four-element crossed array, is on 
the stabilizer fins. 
  It is assumed that such a projectile, supplied with 
proximity 
and impact fuzes, will permit successfully combating helicopters 
at ranges of 8-10 km. It is also reported that its cost is 5-10 
times higher than usual, but in the opinion of foreign 
specialists, with a 50-percent target kill probability, this is 
a fully advantageous alternative to SAM systems. 
  Work also is being done to create a projectile guided by a 
laser beam. It has a sensor for determining angular deflection 
from the line-of-sight, which is used to control operation of 
gas switches of the steering mechanism and change the flight 
path. 
  It is believed that the projectile's guidance along a laser 
beam in combination with a proximity fuze will ensure a target 
kill probability of 0.5-0.7. 
  One new approach to increasing the destructive capacity of 
antiaircraft projectiles when fired against combat helicopters 
with rather powerful armoring is the use of fragmentation 
projectiles with a tungsten core. 
  It is proposed to use tank guns to combat 
helicopters. Tank tube angle of elevation is sufficient for 
bringing fire on a helicopter hovering above the ground for 
launching ATGM's, and the burst of a large-caliber projectile 
(105-mm or 120-mm) several meters from the target is guaranteed 
to destroy it. 
  But artillery systems are incapable of solving all problems 
of antihelicopter warfare. Thus, despite swift reaction, an SP 
AA gun cannot always open fire in time if a helicopter 
approaches the strike target covertly over the shortest 
distance, taking advantage of terrain relief features. In such 
cases, it is desirable to have a means of engaging the target 
beyond its line-of-sight limits. Such a task is accomplished 
within the scope of the U.S. FAADS forward area air defense 
program, which envisages creation of the FOG-M SAM system with 
the capability of over-the-horizon combat against low-flying 
airborne targets and moving armored ground targets. 
  The SAM system has a missile with TV camera, and a 
fiber-optic two-way data transmission cable channel will be used 
for its guidance. In addition to a television head, it is 
planned to outfit the missile with a thermal imaging head 
operating in the 3.5-4.2 micron band. 
  Foreign specialists are considering the question of creating 
a general-purpose SAM system for air and antitank 
defense on a platform that rises into the air. They believe that 
such a system will permit increasing the effectiveness of 
combating helicopters and other low-flying targets, with a 
simultaneous reduction in vulnerability of combat teams because 
of the possibility of its covert employment from behind natural 
cover. 
  The foreign press reports that the United States is 
conducting research aimed at creating an antihelicopter 
mine (AHM). It will receive information on targets from 
acoustic detectors, which are to be set up in pairs on likely 
avenues of helicopter approach. This will permit detecting the 
helicopter and determining its coordinates by triangulation. 
When a helicopter approaches a certain line, a mine is fired at 
a signal from the sensors. Its IR homing head determines the 
most advantageous detonation conditions, as a result of which, 
it is asserted, total destruction of the helicopter ensues. In 
addition, according to the developers' thinking, the threat of 
encountering such a weapon at extremely low altitudes should 
force helicopters to go higher, where air defense weapons will 
be able to operate effectively against them. 
  The firms of Textron Defense Systems and Texas Instruments 
in 
the United States and Ferranti-Eliant Techsystems in Great 
Britain took part in developing the antihelicopter mine concept. 
  The Textron Defense Systems mine, which weighs 182 kg, has a 
jamproof ground sensor acoustic array which detects, classifies, 
identifies and tracks a rotary-wing target. All-around fragment 
coverage of the target area in the azimuthal plane with an 
increased casualty radius permits the mine to act against 
low-flying helicopters. Judging from available information, 
helicopters may be engaged at altitudes up to 200 m. 
  The mine can be used in the forest and in limited areas 
because of a change in trajectory of the impact core formed when 
the charge is triggered. 
  The mines are laid using the MLRS, the Volcano cluster 
mining 
system, and manually. There are provisions for switching off the 
mine in case friendly forces pass through the area where 
emplaced. Remote switch-on and switch-off are supported by 
reliable two-wire communications. 
  Ferranti-Eliant Techsystems developed an antihelicopter mine 
weighing 10 kg with a diameter of 180 mm and a length of 335 mm, 
which is capable of killing targets flying at speeds up to 350 
km/hr and at heights of 100 m and higher. The two-mode passive 
acoustic-IR sensor is jamproof and guarantees precise aiming. 
Identification of nationality is performed by a passive, 
nonemitting means. 
  Deployed on the terrain, the AHM mine operates autonomously, 
but can be supplied with control and monitor modules supporting 
its remote arming and shut-off. 
  In addition to ground assets, air-based systems 
can combat helicopters. The ATAS (Air-to-Air Stinger) 
antihelicopter system has already been developed. It includes a 
launcher accommodated aboard a rotary-wing craft and designed 
for 2 or 4 Stinger guided missiles. Their employment is being 
worked out in OH-58C and D, AH-64A Apache and AH-1 helicopters. 
  A standard launcher weighs 43 kg with two missiles and 100 
kg 
with four. The first model of the ATAS system was demonstrated 
in late 1979 and early 1980 aboard a Lynx helicopter. 
  A helicopter can be armed with guns. Thus, the M230 Chain 
Gun 
30-mm aircraft gun (installed on AH-64A Apache helicopters) 
provides acceptable accuracy of engaging the airborne enemy at a 
distance up to 3 km; the 20-mm gun (on the Huey Cobra) 
successfully engages targets at a distance of up to 1.5 km; and 
the fire of the 7.62-mm machinegun installed aboard a helicopter 
is effective at a range up to 1 km. 
  A program for equipping helicopters with air-to-air missiles 
was begun in France in 1986. The Mistral SAM is being considered 
for these purposes. It is planned to install it on Gazelle, 
Tiger and AH-64A Apache helicopters. 
  In 1988 the British firm Short Brothers together with the 
U.S. firm McDonnell Douglas developed an air-to-air missile 
launcher which will be accommodated on the AH-64A Apache and 
serve for firing the Hellstrike missile against airborne targets. 
  The firm Westland is refitting the Lynx helicopter as a 
reconnaissance version in which the TOW ATGM will be replaced by 
an air-to-air weapon system. The Stinger shoulder-fired SAM 
system (General Dynamics) or Hellstrike with turret-mounted 
machinegun or gun (Short Brothers) are being considered as 
models. The Swedish firm Bofors is studying the possibility of 
accommodating RBS-70 missiles on helicopters. 
  The U.S. Army is showing interest in developing a 
general-purpose system for combating airborne targets and tanks 
(HTDM-Helicopter Team Defense Missile). It is presumed that 
OH-58 reconnaissance helicopters and the AH-64A Apache combat 
helicopter will be equipped with it. 
  The foreign press reports that the question of using 
drones for detecting helicopters is being considered. 
NATO specialists believe that installing television cameras and 
forward-looking IR gear on drones substantially improves the 
speed of receiving video intelligence and permits sharply 
expanding the number of its users with minimum costs. Commanders 
and staffs at all levels will be able to monitor in real time 
individual axes or zones that are most dangerous from the 
standpoint of helicopters and make an adequate decision in the 
shortest time. 
  In addition, because of the absence of a pilot aboard, the 
drone can operate under conditions of increased risk beyond the 
front line. 
  A number of firms are engaged in developing new target 
detection sensors for outfitting the latest unmanned means, 
designated HELTK (Helicopter Killer). The Brave 200 drone was 
chosen as its base. It is to be supplied with a millimeter-band 
radar and processor, which will enable it to independently 
detect and identify a helicopter under conditions of powerful 
ground clutter.

  [Text] In evaluating prospects for development of mortar 
weapons, foreign military specialists note that even in the 
future, mortars will remain the basis of battalion artillery and 
an irreplaceable means of infantry fire support and effective 
engagement of personnel, weapons and vehicles, especially where 
high-trajectory fire is required for their destruction. 
Qualitatively new models of mortars and ammunition for them were 
developed as a result of a complex of work done to upgrade 
mortar weapons in the 1980's, which led to a change in 
organizational structure and tactics for employment of mortar 
subunits. 
  A new direction was developed in creating self-propelled 
[SP] 
mortars with a turret design and full armor protection of crew 
personnel, equipment and ammunition. Smoothbore, muzzle-loading 
mortars are the most widespread. They are designed according to 
the classic scheme of an imaginary triangle with charge ignition 
according to the Stokes scheme (Fig. 1 [figure not reproduced]). 
According to this scheme, ignition and combustion of the primary 
propelling charge occur within its round located in a hollow 
tube called a chamber. On attaining a certain pressure, powder 
gases pierce the walls of the primary charge round, ignite the 
secondary charges contained in the chamber and impart a 
translation movement to the mortar round. The design 
implementation of the imaginary triangle scheme is that the 
mortar tube is hinged with a bipod assembly and base plate; the 
bipod assembly and base plate rest on the ground with no joint 
between them. 
  In the assessment of the NATO command, saturating opposing 
sides' combat formations with mechanized means, providing 
improved protection for targets and providing subunit personnel 
with means of protection against bullets and fragments pose the 
task of substantially increasing the effectiveness of mortar 
ammunition, including kinetic energy of their submunitions 
(fragments). And the dispersal of combat formations and 
increased depth of unit and subunit echelonment under conditions 
of highly mobile combat operations lead to the need to increase 
the range of mortar fire and increase fire and tactical 
maneuverability of mortars. Conduct of large-scale troop 
airlifts also requires lessening the weight of weapon models and 
reducing their dimensions without decreasing combat capabilities 
and effectiveness. 
  Among shortcomings of mortar weapons, the NATO command 
includes their great variety of types, (which complicates 
maintenance), combat employment, coordination of fire control, 
and logistic support. In this connection it is necessary to 
resolve problems of reducing the number of models of mortars and 
ammunition for them, since with limited capacities of 
transportation, the unit of fire carried with the mortar may 
prove sufficient in quantity but unsuited for performance of a 
specific combat mission. Foreign military specialists also note 
the low velocity and long flight time of the mortar round, which 
makes mortars an easy target for detection by modern 
reconnaissance assets. Therefore, work to create new models of 
highly maneuverable, SP mortars based on a light, armored, 
wheeled or tracked chassis with a load-carrying capacity up to 5 
tons is becoming widespread abroad. These and other requirements 
being placed on mortar weapons show that their upgrading in the 
1990's will be conducted along the following directions: 
Increase in range of fire, increase in maneuverability and 
reliability, increase in rate of fire, improvement in grouping 
and accuracy, and so on. 
  The increase in range of fire of mortars is being 
accomplished both through increased muzzle velocity of the 
mortar round and decreased loss of velocity in flight and 
through an additional increase in velocity of the mortar round 
on the trajectory and on the approach to the target. First of 
all, to increase muzzle velocity reinforced propellant charges 
and charges made of powders of a new mixture (for example, 
ballistite-cordite powders) are being used, which provide for 
increased muzzle velocity without a substantial increase in bore 
pressure; secondly, the mortar tube is being lengthened. To 
reduce energy losses the design and configuration of propellant 
charges are being improved and the quality of stabilizing fins 
and bodies is being increased to improve the mortar round's 
aerodynamic shape. New rocket-assisted mortar rounds are being 
developed and also are being widely used to additionally 
increase velocity on the flight path, which in addition provides 
for an increase in muzzle velocity by 125 m/sec or more. 
  To increase maneuverability work is being done to 
reduce the weight of mortars in deployed and traveling 
configurations. To this end possibilities are being sought for 
wider use of light materials possessing high strength, rigidity 
and anticorrosive properties. Alloyed steels, light, 
high-tensile alloys (with use of aluminum, titanium, chrome, 
nickel and molybdenum), and reinforced plastics are being 
studied. Results of such studies from an early period already 
have been realized in specific models. Thus, the L16A1 81-mm 
mortar tube is made of alloyed steel and the M61 81-mm mortar 
tube is made of chrome-nickel steel. The United States and other 
countries have developed polyethylene containers for mortar 
rounds instead of wooden packaging, and cases made of light 
synthetic materials for the propellant charges. This permitted 
considerably reducing overall weight of the transported ready 
inventory and increasing operational reliability of ammunition 
during storage and transportation. Work is constantly being done 
to create SP mortars to increase maneuverability (Fig. 2 [figure 
not reproduced]). Advanced mobile equipment possessing buoyancy, 
air-transportability, and increased speed, range and off-road 
capability is being used as the chassis. The design of devices 
for installing a muzzle-loaded mortar on a self-propelled 
chassis and its removal when conducting fire from the ground is 
being improved. New recoil mechanisms such as of a torsion or 
hydropneumatic type are being developed, considerably reducing 
the force of recoil, which permits using lighter and more highly 
maneuverable mobile equipment as the chassis for the SP mortar. 
  To improve safety of operation of mortars and their 
ammunition, new explosives and more reliable standardized 
proximity fuzes are being developed and trigger mechanisms and 
safeties (interlocks) for them are being upgraded. The United 
States, FRG and Great Britain presently are developing 120-mm SP 
mortars of turret design loaded from the breech end. Automatic 
loaders using robotics (for example, for the RO 2003) and 
systems for diagnosing malfunctions (for example, for the FAMS) 
are being manufactured for them. 
  The rate of fire of muzzle-loaded mortars is rather high, 
but 
duration of continuous fire is limited by tube heating 
temperature, which is limited to a temperature of 180-200C 
because of possible self-ignition of the powder of secondary 
charges. New steels and alloys resistant to heating and 
possessing high strength characteristics, increased heat 
exchange with the surroundings in a broad range of temperatures 
and under various climatic conditions, are being studied for 
increasing the rate of fire. New design schemes and 
plastic-ceramic materials are being sought for mortar round 
obturating devices, which reduce friction as the round moves in 
the bore. New powder mixtures with low combustion temperature 
are being studied for propellant charges. 
  To increase the rate of fire, mechanical and 
automatic devices also are being developed for restoring aim 
after a round is fired. Patents have been registered for a 
mortar round magazine and a loader for a muzzle-loaded mortar 
(Switzerland), and automatic mortars with a turret configuration 
are being created (USA, FRG, Great Britain). 
  Research in the area of improving the grouping and 
accuracy of fire are aimed at improving the design of 
propellant charges and the ignition devices ensuring their 
reliable initiation, creating new obturating devices and 
improving the aerodynamic shape of the mortar round. Stabilizing 
fins of a new design, which make a certain rotation of the 
mortar round possible, are being used to improve mortar round 
stability on the flight path. The design and shape of base 
plates are being changed in order to have greater stability of 
the mortar when firing from different soils, new sighting 
devices are being developed, and firing tables are being 
improved. Mortars and mortar subunits are being outfitted with 
modern means of fire support and fire control. Thus, the United 
States proposes to outfit the FAMS 120-mm SP mortar with a 
topographic survey and orientation system, a computer which 
figures initial data for firing and fire control, and an 
automatic system for laying the mortar. 
  From the early 1980's foreign military specialists began to 
consider the mortar as one of the weapons for combating armored 
equipment, since its ammunition can hit tanks and IFV's from 
above, where they have the weakest armor. Moreover, the range of 
fire of modern 81-mm and 120-mm mortars, which is 5-8 km, 
exceeds the range of fire of antitank missile systems and 
antitank guns. Based on this, a number of western countries have 
stepped up creation of guided mortar ammunition, including that 
which does not require target illumination. Thus, since 1975 the 
FRG has been developing the Bussard 120-mm mortar round equipped 
with a semiactive guidance system with laser homing head 
envisaging the mandatory presence of a device for illuminating 
the target, which is not always possible under conditions of 
modern battle. Therefore, in recent years work has been carried 
out successfully to create mortar rounds with infrared or radar 
homing heads (millimeter waveband), which operate on the "fire 
and forget" principle (Fig. 3). In this case, on the descending 
branch of the mortar round's flight path (for example, the 
Merlin 81-mm) there is a circular scan of the Earth's surface by 
the homing head's field of view. The scan area in searching for 
a moving target is 300x300 m. If a target is not detected, a 
search for a stationary target begins in an area of 100x100 m. 
On detecting it, the tail fin and four control canards located 
on the front part of the body carry out guidance to the target. 
In the assessment of military specialists, compared with the 
Milan antitank missile system (range of fire 2 km and cost of 
&pound;7,500) use of the Merlin mortar round clearly is 
preferable 
(4.5-6 km and &pound;3,700 respectively). 





      Guided mortar rounds with an active guidance system also are 
being developed in the FRG, United States, Sweden and France. 
Their principal characteristics are in the table.

    Adoption of guided munitions will permit outfitting mortar 
subunits with a new, effective means of combating armored 
vehicles. The aggregate of such factors as rate of fire, high 
accuracy of fire, reliable crew protection and high 
maneuverability of SP automatic mortars will permit delivering 
strikes against armored targets that are attacking or moving in 
columns; and it will permit quickly changing firing positions to 
move out from under enemy fire. Such a self-propelled system 
would be more advantageous from the standpoint of cost 
effectiveness than the SP antitank gun or ATGM system. At the 
same time, some foreign military specialists also note 
shortcomings of guided munitions--complexity of design and high 
cost. It is emphasized that mortars cannot compete with antitank 
weapons, since they are incapable of performing their primary 
mission of giving close fire support to infantry subunits when 
there are no other means for this, but they themselves are 
engaged in combating enemy armored vehicles. 
  To improve effectiveness of action of mortar 
rounds new mixtures of explosives are being developed 
abroad which provide a high level of kinetic energy of the 
fragment stream with optimum choice of body material. Malleable 
perlitic iron and graphitized steel are beginning to be used to 
manufacture the bodies. For example, use of malleable perlitic 
iron for the bodies of 81-mm mortar rounds doubles their 
fragmentation effect against personnel compared with a 
ferrosteel body. Graphitized steel provides even better mortar 
round body fragmentation. In recent years the United States and 
Spain have been giving great attention to developing 120-mm 
cluster munitions with shaped-charge-fragmentation submunitions 
of the SADARM type providing a sharp increase in effectiveness 
of engaging personnel and vehicles. 
  Resolving questions of unification and standardization 
of mortar weapons is facilitated by coordinating overall 
technical requirements for mortars and ammunition within the 
NATO framework. In addition, joint developments are being 
conducted abroad, as a result of which a new model of mortar or 
ammunition goes to several countries. The export sale of mortar 
weapons is being carried out on a broad scale, which for many 
states precludes the need to perform their own development and 
adjust series production. For purposes of unification, it is 
also the practice to develop several versions of individual 
parts of a standardized mortar (tubes, base plates), which 
permits putting together models for subunits of different combat 
arms. 
  The development of mortar weapons will follow the path of 
creation of new models and modernization of existing ones to 
improve their main specifications and performance 
characteristics. The scale of RDT&amp;E being performed abroad to 
create new mortar weapons and ammunition for them indicates that 
in the future as well, mortars will hold an important place in 
the armament system of ground troops of armies in many countries.

  [Text] Conceptual provisions were developed in the early 
1960's on using means of simulating a real electronic 
environment to create near-combat conditions in exercises, in 
accordance with which specially equipped aircraft appeared in 
the inventory. Their mission includes active and passive jamming 
of friendly electronics and saturation of the electronic 
environment with signals simulating the operation of various 
enemy electronics. At present, 12 foreign states have similar 
aircraft operating in support of the air force and navy which 
have been designated "Aggressor" aircraft. 
  The first formally organized air group was formed in the 
United States in the mid-1960's based on aircraft leased from 
civilian airlines. In 1965 McDonnell Douglas fitted out two B-52 
Stratofortress strategic bombers, based at Tulsa Air Force Base 
[AFB] (Oklahoma), with special gear. Subsequently (1977-1978) 
they were replaced by modernized NKC-135A Stratotankers (Waco 
AFB, Texas). In 1987 the EC-24A (modified DC-8) was added to 
them. The question presently being considered is of using new 
Learjet Smart Crow EW aircraft to perform these missions. 
  In 1968 a special EW group intended for simulating the 
electronic environment -- FEWSG (Fleet Electronic Warfare 
Support Group) with headquarters in Norfolk -- was established 
on a permanent basis directly in the structure of U.S. Naval 
Aviation. It is made up of three squadrons of EW aircraft 
(VAQ-33, VAQ-34 and VAQ-35) based at the Key West (Florida), 
Lemoore (California) and Whidbey Island (Washington) naval air 
stations, as well as subunits responsible for preparing exercise 
areas and deploying monitoring and measuring equipment and data 
collection and processing points in them. 
  The squadrons are equipped with EA-6B Prowler, EF/A-18 
Hornet, and EP-3E and J Orion EW aircraft as well as a group of 
NKC-135A, EC-24A and Learjet 35 aircraft on a five-year lease 
from McDonnell Douglas. In addition to the squadrons, the FEWSG 
includes two subunits servicing eight AN/ULQ-13 
ground-transportable systems (they simulate ground or shipboard 
radars) and also ELINT and ECM sets. The NKC-135A and EC-24A 
aircraft have AN/ALT-40 and AN/ALT-28 ECM sets with an operating 
band of 0.1-18 GHz and the AN/ALR-75 warning receiver with 
attached OE-320/A direction finder. These aircraft are capable 
of flying at altitudes around 11,000 m at up to Mach 0.8 for at 
least six hours. 
  The U.S. Air Force command currently does not have a similar 
group at its disposal. FEWSG Aircraft as well as aircraft of 
auxiliary and combat aviation equipped with suspended pods with 
EW gear are leased for exercises and drills in using EW 
equipment. 
  Procedures and methods of using various weapon systems are 
rehearsed, problems of improving capabilities of EW equipment 
are solved and scientific research is conducted in the course of 
the exercises. In addition, actions of flight and ground 
personnel (officers of tactical air control centers, 
communications and EW specialists, weapon system operators, air 
traffic control center controllers) are evaluated under jamming 
conditions. 
  The training drill of flight and ground personnel in a 
period 
of escalating tension in any region of the world and preparation 
for delivering a strike acquires special significance. Thus, 
from August 1990 through January 1991 FEWSG crews took an active 
part in U.S. Navy exercises in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf 
(Operation Desert Shield), simulating emissions of Iraqi Armed 
Forces electronics. 
  In the mid-1980's an MEWSG (Multi-Service EW Support Group) 
for simulating the electronic environment, stationed at 
Yeovilton Air Base (UK), was established to support drills and 
exercises of subunits of NATO Allied Forces Europe (above all of 
the Allied Air and Naval Forces). Its missions include creating 
a real electronic environment in Allied Forces exercises and 
also at the request of national armed forces. The MEWSG leases 
Falcon 20 aircraft belonging to a British airline. 
  In addition, aircraft leased from a U.S. airline and 
stationed at Naples, Italy (two Learjet Sea Crows and one 
Learjet Smart Crow, Fig. 1 [figure not reproduced]) operate in 
support of NATO Allied Naval Forces Mediterranean and the U.S. 
Sixth Fleet. Eleven types of ECM sets in a pod configuration 
covering the frequency bands 250-500 MHz, 1-2 GHz and 8-20 GHz 
are used aboard them. Sets of EW gear also are adapted for 
suspension to air force and naval aviation aircraft of Belgium, 
France, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey. 
  The NATO leadership presently has adopted the CTFS 
(Contractor Training Flight Service) program for establishing 
two MEWSG groups of the new Learjet Phoenix Crow aggressor 
aircraft. Its electronic equipment suite will include AN/DLQ-3C 
and AN/ALQ-176 jammers, the AN/ALE-43 antiradar chaff dispenser 
and a VHF/HF communications jammer. 
  A long-range program for using aggressor aircraft in support 
of the Air Force and Navy was developed in Great Britain in 
1984. Ten Falcon 20 light transport aircraft were equipped with 
ARTS-5 and AN/ALQ-167 jammers. Hunter and Canberra (Fig. 2 
[figure not reproduced]) glider-towing aircraft from naval 
aviation can be used in addition for performing special 
missions; it is planned to use them to replace Learjet 35 EW 
aircraft in the period 1994-1996. Each year they take part in 
approximately 20 operational activities conducted under national 
and coalition plans. 
  Five Falcon 20 aircraft were purchased in Canada in 1991 and 
became part of the joint Anglo-French ADS (Aviation Defence 
Services) Group. They began to be used on a regular basis to 
perform EW missions in support of the French Air Force and Navy 
in 1992. 
  Two Learjet 35 aircraft fitted with sets of EW gear (the 
U.S. 
Naval Aviation FEWSG has similar ones) are used on a contract 
basis in support of the Danish Navy. 
  Sweden purchased ten aircraft (two Learjet 35's and eight 
MU-2B Petrus), and jammers and BOZ-3 antiradar chaff dispensers 
were installed in them. These aircraft serve to train Swedish 
Air Force flight and ground personnel for combat operations when 
EW assets are used. 
  Aggressor aircraft take part in operational activities 
varying in scale and purpose, of which the most significant is 
the U.S. Air Force Red Flag tactical air exercise held at the 
Nellis (Nevada) range, which is similar in conditions to the 
Central European TVD [theater of military operations]. Special 
attention is given to creating a real, complex electronic 
environment and to increasing the number of operating enemy 
electronic assets (to approximately 130). The aggressor aircraft 
jam from a loiter zone 10-20 km from the presumed front line. To 
increase ECM capabilities, tactical fighters rehearse effective 
methods of using individual and collective protection gear 
during the exercises. This EW equipment basically is 
accommodated in pods. 
  In accordance with adopted standards, along with other kinds 
of training each U.S. Air Force tactical aviation crew must make 
at least two air-to-air guided missile launches under ECM 
conditions in a two-year period. Essentially all training 
sorties to intercept an airborne target also take place under 
the effect of jamming. 
  Recommendations designed for a complex jamming situation 
have 
been developed for tactical aviation pilots: Refrain from using 
instrument readings affected by electronic emissions; use backup 
instruments; execute prescribed actions precisely. 
  Aggressor aircraft crews include 2-3 trained operators who 
have a good knowledge of the tactical-technical characteristics 
and capabilities of the probable enemy's electronic assets and 
his operating methods. 
  Onboard EW equipment of aggressor aircraft is divided into 
three categories: Sets for ECM against enemy radar equipment 
(including antiradar chaff dispensers); communications jammers; 
and simulators of enemy radar equipment. 
  The mission of creating a complex jamming environment for 
training purposes is implemented on general technical principles 
developed for EW combat systems. Special demands are placed on 
them: Capability of operating in a broad frequency band (from 
0.25 to 20 GHz), a rather large selection of jammers, 
interchangeability and flexibility of operational use. The 
effective range of onboard ECM sets is 30-40 km. Airborne 
radars, radar altimeters, side-looking radars and ground system 
navigational equipment are subject to the effect of ECM sets. 
  Simulators of electronic equipment are unique gear which 
simulate the operation of enemy radar equipment above all. They 
must give crews and weapon system teams an opportunity to 
rehearse methods of repelling guided missile attacks. 
  A brief description of basic models of electronic 
jammers is given below: 
  The AN/ALQ-167(V) is one of the most widespread types of 
sets 
used by aggressor aircraft (it can be used in 20 types of 
aircraft, Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]). It is accommodated in 
a suspended pod 3.76 m long and supports jamming in the 2-20 GHz 
frequency band. Transmitting antennas are in the front and rear 
of the pod. The gear weighs 158 kg. It emits both noise as well 
as pulsed responsive jamming with various kinds of modulation 
(eight for noise and eight for pulsed responsive jamming). It is 
combined with a radar warning receiver, if necessary. The set is 
controlled remotely from the ground or from an operator console 
aboard the aircraft. It is planned to automate its remote and 
onboard control equipment, install new antennas, increase power 
output, expand the jammer operating band, and also examine the 
possibility of using digital radio-frequency memories in jamming 
circuits. Outside the United States the AN/ALQ-167 is used in 
aircraft of the NATO MEWSG. 
  In the Canadian Air Force this set is designated AN/ALQ-502 
and is suspended on EC-144 and ET-133 transport aircraft, and in 
the United States to EA-6B, EP-3J, EF/A-18 A and B and NKC-135 
aircraft which are part of the U.S. Naval Aviation FEWSG. 
  The AN/ALQ-176 is a multipurpose noise jammer developed by 
the firm of Hercules and used in Smart Crow and Sea Crow 
modifications of Learjet aircraft. A typical set in a Learjet 
Smart Crow includes five jammers installed inside the fuselage 
(two designed for the 1-2 GHz band and three for the 2-4 GHz 
band) with an effective power output of 650 watts each. 
  Sweep, spot or barrage noise jamming of five enemy 
electronic 
assets can be accomplished simultaneously in the Learjet Smart 
Crow version. From the control console the operator has an 
opportunity to quickly reprogram jammer operating modes by 
frequency and kind of modulation. 
  The set of EW gear in the Learjet Sea Crow includes three 
spot and barrage noise jammers covering the 1-2, 2-4 and 8-10 
GHz frequency bands with an effective power output of 300, 400 
and 100 watts respectively. 
  The AN/ALQ-188 is used in support of the U.S. Air Force 
during exercises for noise and pulsed responsive jamming in the 
8-10 GHz frequency band. It was created in a pod version based 
on the AN/DLQ-3 ECM set developed by the U.S. Navy Pacific 
Missile Test Center. Learjet aircraft are the platforms. 
  The AN/ALQ-28 is a version of the AN/ALT-28 noise jammer 
adapted for the NKC-135A aircraft. 
  The AN/ALT-40(V) is used in NKC-135 (one per aircraft) and 
EC-24A aircraft (two per aircraft) as a powerful source of noise 
jamming in the 8-20 GHz band. It is produced by the U.S. firm 
Watkins Johnson. 
  Systems of the above ECM sets cover the entire band of 
frequencies presently being used by electronic equipment of 
probable enemies. Steps are being taken to increase their 
effective power output by installing highly directional antennas 
with steerable beams. 
  The Adrian is made in a pod configuration by the Swedish 
firm 
Ericsson. It is used in two versions (with frequency bands of 
2-4 and 4-8 GHz) in Swedish Air Force J-32E EW aircraft and in 
the MU-2B Petrus and Learjet aircraft leased from civilian lines 
for jamming ground (surface) acquisition radars. The receiver is 
controlled by a microprocessor. Transceiver antennas are located 
on the front and rear of the pod case. 
  The AN/DLQ-3, developed in the early 1960's, underwent a 
number of modernizations (DLQ-3B, DLQ-3C). It is installed in EW 
aircraft (EC-24A, Learjet Smart Crow, EC-144 Challenger) and 
target drones (BQM-34A/S, BQM-34ET, QF-4 and QF-100). In 
addition, it is used as fixed and mobile ground simulators. The 
operating band is 1-20 GHz. Jamming signals can be emitted with 
different kinds of modulation (up to 24). The set's basic 
purpose is to support tests, evaluate weapon systems and train 
operators of C[.sup]3[/] systems and radar posts. 
  Aries-A (Italian firm of Elettronica) is intended both for 
operator training and for use under combat conditions. The ELINT 
gear, covering the 0.5-20 GHz frequency band, uses digital 
superheterodyne receivers with instantaneous frequency change. 
The firm's experience gained in the course of equipping Falcon 
20 (Norway), HFB.320 (Germany) and PD.808 (Italy) EW aircraft 
was taken into account in creating the equipment. It is proposed 
to install it in Spanish Air Force C-212 EW aircraft. 
  The Druse Moss [name as transliterated] (UK) is produced on 
the basis of the AN/ALQ-167 set described above. The gear 
operates in the 8-10 GHz band and the units are accommodated 
inside the fuselage. Six sets have been produced, which are 
installed in Canberra glider-towing aircraft of UK Royal Navy 
Aviation. 
  The A.100 Erijammer (6-10 GHz band) is produced by the 
consortium of Ericsson-Rodeil and is part of the REWTS 
(Responsive EW Training System). It includes a warning receiver, 
panoramic receiver, and monitor. The gear, weighing 210 kg, is 
housed in a suspended pod 3.23 m long. There is coverage of a 
360 sector in the receive and transmit (jamming) mode. The 
subsystem is controlled by a microprocessor and supports 12 data 
output modes, four electronic signal search modes, nine noise 
jamming modes, 14 modes of manipulative, responsive pulsed 
jamming of Doppler radars, and six modes of combination jamming. 
A multifunctional suppression mode (four successive changes in 
operating frequencies) is supported additionally. It is capable 
of functioning as a threat signal (enemy electronic equipment) 
source. The A.100 set underwent an extensive flight test program 
during 1991-1992. 
  The B.100 Erijammer is undergoing full-scale engineering 
development. It supplements the A.100 in the REWTS program, 
supporting coverage of the 2-6 GHz frequency band. It is planned 
to increase the jammer's effective radiating power to 10 kw. It 
is also proposed to accommodate B.100 set gear within the 
fuselage of the PC-9 Pilatus turbojet trainer. A pod version 
also is not precluded. 
  The G.24 (Sweden) is intended for jamming ground-based air 
search radars. It is produced in three versions for three 
frequency bands: 1-2, 2-4 and 4-8 GHz. The gear, accommodated 
within the fuselage of the J-32E EW aircraft, is designed for 
generating noise and manipulative responsive pulsed jamming. The 
enemy electronic emissions search subsystem also performs 
functions of a warning receiver. 
  The 8-20 GHz band Petrus (Sweden) is intended for noise and 
responsive radar jamming. It is accommodated in a pod and used 
on J-32E and Learjet aircraft. Work to modernize it was 
conducted during 1991-1992. 
  The 8100 (Sweden) supplements gear created under the REWTS 
program. It has four modular subsystems which jam in the 0.5-2, 
2-4, 4-6 and 8-10 GHz frequency bands. There is a total of 24 
modes for generating noise or pulsed responsive jamming. An 
attached computer performs control. Internal fuselage and pod 
accommodation of gear is envisaged. 
  Tree Pods are a family of these suspended-pod ECM sets 
developed for the NKC-135A aircraft of the U.S. Navy FEWSG. The 
sets, with an emissive power output up to 1 kw, are designed for 
different frequency bands. Two pods of this type can be 
suspended to an aircraft simultaneously. Chaff dispensers are 
presented below. 
  The AN/ALE-43 is produced by a U.S. firm in a pod version 
and 
in the form of a set for installation within an aircraft 
fuselage. In the first case the device can contain chaff with an 
overall weight of 145 kg. 
  In the U.S. Navy EW air group such pod installations can be 
suspended beneath EA-6B, EP-3E and J aircraft and preferably 
beneath the EF/A-18A and B. NKC-135A and EC-24A (two on each), 
leased Learjet Smart Crow, and EC-144 (Canadian Air Force) 
aircraft have been adapted for internal fuselage accommodation 
of the AN/ALE-43 device. In one version (for the Learjet Smart 
Crow), the knife of the cutter is adjusted for chaff size 
corresponding to the 1-2, 2-4 and 8-10 GHz frequency bands. The 
aggregate length of dipoles is 5,092 m and the time for 
dispensing chaff is up to 11 minutes. Maximum descent rate of 
the aluminized fiberglass dipole is 914 m/hr. 
  The BOZ-3 in a pod configuration is used on Swedish Air 
Force 
J-32E or leased MU-2B aircraft. Control is manual or automatic. 
When chaff is used, clouds or corridors are created for the 
passage of strike elements of aircraft. 
  Communications jammers are listed below. 
  The AN/ASQ-191A is an experimental development of the U.S. 
firm Rockwell-Collins and is for testing C[.sup]3[/] gear for 
resistance to jamming. It is installed in an EC-24A EW aircraft. 
  The AN/USQ-113 is housed in pods suspended to EC-24A and 
EP-3J aircraft of the U.S. Navy FEWSG and on E-3 Orion 
land-based patrol aircraft for deceptive, spot, and barrage 
noise and tonal communications jamming. ECM gear in the EP-3J EW 
aircraft includes the MD-1203 speech modulator, radar emission 
simulator, PSC-3 satellite communications set, WJ-8718A 
panoramic search receiver, AN/ARC-190 HF radio, AN/USQ-103 and 
AN/ALQ-170 ECM pods, AN/ALT-40 ECM set and OE-320 radio 
direction-finder. 
  The Dragonfly (of UK firm GTE) is accommodated in Canberra 
glider-towing aircraft of UK Royal Navy Aviation. It is capable 
of generating FM and AM noise jamming with a power output up to 
1 kw. The set is controlled manually and automatically. A total 
of 20 sets of gear have been made for an overall amount of $16 
million under a contract let in 1985. 
  The Mera (Ericsson, Sweden) is installed in J-32E aircraft. 
It generates noise jamming with different kinds of modulation 
and is capable of suppressing VHF-band communications equipment 
on several frequencies simultaneously. There are provisions for 
a manipulative emissions mode, including the output of false 
signals and commands. 
  Smart Guard/Fast Jam is a communications jammer in the HF 
and 
VHF bands. It is a component part of the Aries-A onboard EW 
system produced by the Italian firm Elettronica. 
  The UST-104B is produced by Rockwell-Collins (USA) and is 
intended for communications jamming in the 100-500 MHz frequency 
band. In addition to generating jamming signals with noise and 
tone modulation, it is capable of creating manipulative jamming 
which simulates control signals and commands. Three carrier 
frequencies can be suppressed in a time-division mode. Jammer 
power output, adjustable in flight, reaches 400 watts. 
  The ZS 1910 (Canada) was selected by the Ministry of Defense 
leadership as a base system for three EC-144 EW aircraft. The 
system includes a radio direction-finder and jammer. 
  Simulators of enemy electronic equipment are 
examined below. 
  The AN/ALQ-170(V) is a set of gear for simulating the 
emission of radar homing heads of various types of antiship 
missiles. It was developed for use on EA-6B and EP-3J EW 
aircraft and on the F/A-18 A and B deck-based fighter/attack 
aircraft. 
  The AN/AST-4(V) is a pod simulator of radar homing head 
signals. It is widely used on NATO MEWSG Falcon 20, Hunter, GA11 
and Learjet 35C aircraft and on EA-6B aircraft of the U.S. Naval 
Aviation FEWSG. The gear is accommodated in a suspended pod 2.1 
m long and generates signals in the 6-10 and 10-20 GHz frequency 
bands. It is remotely controlled from the ground or from a 
console in the aircraft cockpit. Emission modes and parameters 
are set by a special SG-1189/AST-5(V) unit contained in a sealed 
bay of the aircraft. The SG-1189 unit provides for selection of 
a pulse repetition frequency from 3 to 5,999 pulses per second, 
pulse emission modes, and kind and parameters of homing head 
scanning. There are grounds to assume that the set's production 
may be stopped in connection with transition to more modern 
models. AN/AST-4 gear was reconfigured into pods from the 
AN/ALQ-167 ECM set for use on Learjet Sea Crow aircraft. 
  The AN/AST-7(V) is a multipurpose simulator of enemy 
electronic signals in the 6-40 GHz frequency band. It is 
produced in a suspended pod 3.3 m long and is intended for 
simulating signals of onboard acquisition radars, intercept and 
aiming radars, terrain relief following system radars, and radar 
homing heads of various classes of guided missiles. The system 
operator can choose the carrier frequency, pulse repetition 
frequency and pulse duration. The pulse repetition frequency and 
parameters of pulse emission and homing head scanning are 
regulated using the control unit. A mode for remote switching of 
oscillation frequency also is possible. The transmitter puts out 
a peak power on the order of 125 kw. The gear weighs 145.6 kg. 
  The DARTS (Digital Airborne Radar Threat Simulator) is 
equipment for simulating enemy radar signals. It is housed in a 
suspended pod 3.1 m long and is a component part of the REWTS 
simulator system. The band of operating frequencies is 6-20 GHz. 
It is possible to control all parameters of simulated electronic 
equipment signals from the control console manually or by 
computer program. Mean emissive power of the transmitter is 12.5 
megawatts. The set weighs 147 kg. This simulator is taking part 
in a competition for delivery to the NATO MEWSG under a program 
for upgrading simulation equipment. Three models were delivered 
for test operation in special aircraft.

  [Text] An aircraft with an acquisition radar for early 
warning of the appearance of airborne targets was used for the 
first time 50 years ago during World War II. This small U.S. 
aircraft, the TBM-3W Avenger, was based on aircraft carriers. A 
year later PB-1W land-based aircraft, developed on the basis of 
the B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber, began to be used in 
support of fleet combat operations. One and the same radar 
(later designated AN/APS-20), operating in the 10 cm waveband, 
was installed in both aircraft. In the 1950's several other 
radar early warning aircraft were created with different 
versions of that radar with a dish antenna and housed in a dome 
beneath the fuselage--Guardian, Skyraider, Gannet, EC-12 and 
Shackleton. They were intended for operations over the sea. One 
(the British Shackleton-AEW.2) was used right up until 1991. 
  Subsequently, the capabilities of these aircraft were 
reduced 
considerably in connection with increased speeds of strike 
aircraft using low flight altitudes and with mass employment of 
aviation. Airborne radar early warning and control systems with 
pulse-Doppler radars capable of providing vast areas of 
surveillance of low-flying targets and performing functions as 
air control centers came to replace them during the 
1960's-1970's. 
  At the present time preference is given abroad to two types 
of radar early warning and control systems based on the E-2C 
Hawkeye and E-3 AWACS system aircraft. In recent years new ones 
-- P-3 AEW Sentinel and C-130 AEW with the radar used on the 
E-2C Hawkeye, and the Defender with Skymaster radar -- also have 
begun to arrive. 
  In contrast to radar early warning aircraft of the 1940's 
and 
1950's, they have more sophisticated radars which acquire 
airborne and surface targets at long ranges against a background 
of ground clutter, and high-capacity onboard data processing, 
display and exchange equipment. The latter permits successfully 
acquiring and automatically tracking a large number of targets 
and guiding friendly aircraft to them. In addition to radars, 
the makeup of radar early warning and control system equipment 
includes sets for ELINT collection and identification of 
nationality; communications and data exchange equipment; 
navigation, flight control and landing gear; various control 
consoles; a central computer; and data processors. 
  Characteristics of radar early warning and control 
systems are given in the table.

    Hawkeye aircraft, created in the United States in the early 
1960's for deck-based naval aviation, have become widespread 
abroad. The first of them (E-2A and E-2B) subsequently were 
refitted as the more modern E-2C, which became operational in 
1972. At the present time around 200 aircraft already have been 
produced. In the United States they are basically used by the 
Navy in the deck-based version with folding outboard wing 
panels. In other countries (Israel, Egypt, Japan, Singapore), 
they are employed from shore airfields. The U.S. Navy presently 
plans to stop purchasing new Hawkeye aircraft, but several other 
foreign states attracted by their relatively low cost are 
showing interest in them. 
  Equipment was constantly upgraded in the process of Hawkeye 
radar early warning and control aircraft production. The radar 
underwent an especially significant modernization -- six 
versions were created. This was explained above all by the 
radar's poor noise rejection and limited capabilities for 
discriminating targets against the background of ground clutter 
(but not reflections from the sea). Work presently is being 
completed on the radar's latest modernization, which U.S. 
specialists believe will permit effectively using the E-2C even 
in the 21st century. The effective range of the radar and of 
equipment for identifying nationality will be increased by 40 
percent, the number of targets tracked will increase fourfold 
(it was 250), and targets displayed on the screen of 
multifunctional control consoles will increase by 9.6 times. 
  It is planned to upgrade the new radar (designated 
AN/APS-145) by use of high-speed digital processors with great 
capabilities, introduction of an automatic frequency change 
under the effect of interference, and use of three pulse 
repetition frequencies of emitted signals, increasing the 
effectiveness of tracking targets during flight operations over 
land. Installation of modern seven-color displays (the screen 
size rose from 25x25 cm to 27.5x27.5 cm) will enable displaying 
over 2,000 targets. A NAVSTAR satellite radionavigation 
receiver, which will increase accuracy of determining the 
aircraft's position, and improved equipment of the JTIDS joint 
tactical communications and information distribution system also 
are being introduced to the equipment makeup. Production of the 
E-2C Hawkeye with new onboard equipment is planned for 
1993-1994, and modernization of the old ones is to be completed 
by 1998. 
  One deficiency of the aforementioned aircraft is limited 
endurance. Proposals for equipping it with additional fuel tanks 
or an aerial refueling system have not been supported, since 
this precludes substitution of crew members for rest. They 
operate under difficult conditions of cramped space and high 
noise. 
  Capabilities of the E-3 AWACS airborne early warning and 
control system aircraft, created in the United States to support 
command and control of air defense forces and assets over large 
territories, is considerably broader. It began to become 
operational in 1977, and 68 aircraft were produced in five 
different versions before its production stopped in 1991. Of 
these, the E-3B and C are used in the U.S. Air Force, the E-3A 
in the NATO Allied Air Defense System in Europe and Saudi 
Arabia, and the E-3D and E-3F in the UK and French air forces 
respectively. 
  The E-3B and C radar early warning and control systems have 
a 
greater amount of communications equipment compared with the 
E-3A NATO-AWACS and E-3D and F. AN/APY-1 radars are installed in 
the E-3A (Saudi Arabia) and E-3B, and the more modern AN/APY-2 
radars in the others. E-3A aircraft of the Saudi Arabian Air 
Force as well as the E-3D and F use new engines of the French 
firm of SNECMA and their power is approximately ten percent 
higher. Other differences are unimportant and consist, for 
example, of the installation of an aerial refueling system 
different from the U.S. system and, on the British version, use 
of an ELINT set of their own development housed in wingtip pods. 
  E-3 AWACS systems are constantly being upgraded in the 
process of production. In particular, it is possible to note 
modernization of the AN/APY-1 radar as the AN/APY-2 version 
chiefly by introducing to it a supplementary operating mode 
against surface targets, and also an increase in central 
computer capabilities, which permitted increasing the number of 
targets being tracked automatically. In addition, expansion of 
the system equipment mix was provided for in advance. An 
increase in the number of multifunctional control consoles from 
9 to 14 also should be included among the most important 
improvements. Since 1993 the AN/AYR-1 ELINT set has been 
installed in E-3A NATO-AWACS and E-3C aircraft. The latter will 
permit determining the type of radar or other electronic sets, 
their operating mode and their location by an analysis of 
signals being received. A high data processing rate supports 
identification of up to 100 targets in 10 seconds. A signal 
source and platform characteristics data bank stored in the 
central computer memory is used. The station weighs 860 kg and 
consists of 23 units. U.S. radar early warning and control 
aircraft and those belonging to NATO are to be outfitted with it 
during 1997-1998. France also is showing an interest in the set. 
  It is also planned to outfit E-3 aircraft with NAVSTAR 
satellite radionavigation system receivers, upgraded JTIDS 
system data transmission equipment in the 2H modification, a 
more powerful central computer, and subsequently with MILSTAR 
space communications system gear. Much attention is being given 
to fulfilling the program for modernizing the radar of AWACS 
systems to improve its capabilities in acquiring low-signature 
targets. The set's effective range will almost double through 
improved signal processing quality (with the help of a new 
high-powered processor) and through a change in the structure of 
emitted signals with inclusion of a signal spectrum analyzer in 
the gear with a display located at the radar control console. It 
is proposed to complete modification of the radar under this 
program in the late 1990's, which in the opinion of U.S. 
specialists will permit successfully using E-3 AWACS radar early 
warning and control systems until 2010-2015. 
  The E-3 aircraft is costly and operates from runways of 
great 
length, and so its purchase is accessible only to certain 
countries. The E-2C is approximately three times cheaper than 
the E-3, but has half the patrol time and worse radar 
characteristics. In view of this, in organizing zones of lengthy 
patrolling, it is necessary to activate at the very least two 
E-2C's in place of one E-3. Foreign specialists realize the 
requirement for the appearance of a radar early warning and 
control aircraft occupying an intermediate position in 
capabilities and cost between the E-3 and E-2C. 
  In Great Britain, the Nimrod with AN/APY-920 radar could 
have 
become that aircraft, but after lengthy work and expenditure of 
considerable funds the country's Ministry of Defence in 1986 
(already in the process of acceptance tests) was forced to give 
up further development and make the decision to purchase the 
U.S. E-3 Sentry. This was due to the fact that the radar (two 
antenna systems installed in the fuselage nose and tail to 
provide a circular scan) and data processing equipment did not 
meet demands being placed on them. 
  In the 1980's, the U.S. firm Lockheed began to study 
versions 
of installing the E-2C Hawkeye aircraft system radar in its own 
medium-size aircraft intended for other missions. In 1981 a 
model of the C-130 military transport aircraft (reduced 10 
times), with the fairing of this radar antenna located on a 
shortened tail fin, underwent wind-tunnel testing. A version of 
the airborne early warning and control system was created in 
1984 on a P-3 Orion land-based patrol aircraft with the dome of 
the AN/APS-125 radar, rotating together with the antenna, 
accommodated on a pedestal above the fuselage (similar to the 
E-2C and E-3). In 1985 this aircraft with dome, but without 
radar gear, was demonstrated at an aerospace exhibition in 
France. 
  After unsuccessful tests of the radar early warning and 
control system on the Nimrod-AEW.3, Lockheed suggested 
installing its radar on a C-130, which would permit a 40 percent 
increase in payload weight and a 25 percent increase in volume 
of space for the operations team (compared with the Nimrod). 
  In 1988 development was completed on the radar early warning 
and control system with AN/APS-125 radar for the P-3 AEW 
aircraft (Fig. 1 [figure not reproduced]), given the company 
designation of Sentinel. It was handed over to the U.S. Customs 
Service, which decided to purchase four such aircraft for 
detecting aircraft and vessels of smugglers/drug suppliers over 
the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Three aircraft already 
have been transferred to this service and it is planned to 
deliver the fourth in late 1993. A more modern version of the 
Hawkeye radar early warning and control system radar, the 
AN/APS-138, is installed in all aircraft except the first, and 
standard P-3 Orion aircraft equipment is used. Software was 
developed by Lockheed. The work of refitting the P-3 Orion as a 
radar early warning and control version is valued at 
approximately $10 million, and on the whole it will cost the 
client almost $35 million. 
  The EC-130 AEW aircraft (Fig. 2 [figure not reproduced]), 
with the newest version of the Hawkeye aircraft radar 
(AN/APS-145) and its other equipment, made the first test flight 
in 1991 and subsequently became operational with the U.S. Coast 
Guard. 
  The P-3 AEW and EC-130 AEW have communications gear 
supporting transmission of data obtained with their help to air 
defense command and control centers; it is proposed to export 
them to other countries. Lockheed is undertaking to create new 
aircraft with the AN/APS-145 radar and Grumman is undertaking to 
refit the C-130, with installation of all E-2C Hawkeye aircraft 
gear. The new radar early warning and control systems using P-3 
and C-130 aircraft cost approximately half that of the AWACS 
system E-3, but 1.5 times more than the E-2C Hawkeye. But 
expenses for their purchase and operation can be reduced by 
refitting aircraft which are in the order of battle and also 
using already deployed equipment and elements of the 
infrastructure for servicing them. At the present time 62 
countries have C-130 transport aircraft and 9 have P-3 Orion 
land-based patrol aircraft in the inventory. Government circles 
of Japan and Australia were discussing questions of purchasing 
such radar early warning and control systems. 
  Along with the radar early warning and control systems 
described above, proposals of firms are published periodically 
in the press for refitting G.222 and other aircraft for these 
purposes, but most often the essence of this work consists of 
creating inexpensive systems with limited capabilities 
accommodated in small aircraft. The Defender is the most 
well-known system of this type and already has found use. The 
BN-2B light passenger aircraft served as its basis (Fig. 3 
[figure not reproduced]). Its cost is 2-5 times lower (depending 
on the equipment mix) than for the E-2C Hawkeye. The Skymaster 
radar antenna, providing a circular scan, is installed in a dome 
in the fuselage nose. This pulse-Doppler radar was developed 
based on the Searchwater radar being used on land-based patrol 
aircraft. The system makeup includes one or two multifunctional 
control consoles with color displays. The system's computer 
equipment is capable of supporting automatic tracking of up to 
100 airborne and 32 surface targets. 
  During 1987-1988 the Defender radar early warning and 
control 
aircraft was demonstrated at various exhibitions and offered for 
sale. The press reported that three systems were purchased for 
Great Britain in 1989. 
  In the early 1990's the U.S. firm Westinghouse proposed to 
outfit radar early warning aircraft with a modified AN/APG-66 
radar of the F-16 fighter with a new antenna (1.3x0.8 m) and 
infrared acquisition system for use by the U.S. National Guard 
and for sale to other countries. Various foreign firms have also 
proposed installing similar radars and other equipment in 
existing small aircraft, but there is presently no information 
about adoption of these proposals and purchase of such systems. 
  For a long time the U.S. Air Force and Navy have been 
developing new-generation radar early warning and control 
systems which will use radars with large antennas in the form of 
phased arrays with fully electronic scanning of the surveillance 
zone space. These qualitatively new assets will permit detecting 
such low-signature targets as cruise missiles at great 
distances, but U.S. specialists believe they will appear in the 
inventory only during the next century. Simplified versions of 
similar systems--Erieye and Falcon--presently are being created 
in Sweden and Israel respectively, but it is not clear for now 
whether they will be able to compete with already existing 
models. At the same time, the most widespread systems installed 
in E-2C Hawkeye and E-3 AWACS aircraft already have demonstrated 
their high capabilities in the course of combat operations in 
the Arab-Israeli conflicts and in the Persian Gulf War. 
  Thus, different versions of radar early warning and control 
systems have been created abroad differing in characteristics 
and cost. Thanks to good survivability and the capability of 
detecting low-flying targets, their role in supporting air 
defense will grow (especially on territories not having a ground 
radar network); and so one can expect them to spread throughout 
the world in the future.

  [Text] The F-22, proposed by a group of firms headed by 
Lockheed, was chosen in the course of a 54-month program for 
engineering evaluation of competitive YF-23 and YF-22 prototypes 
for subsequent development as the U.S. Air Force advanced 
tactical fighter. A number of shortcomings were identified in 
the process of subsequent ground and flight tests of models of 
this aircraft, and a program running up to the end of 1993 was 
drawn up to remedy them. 
  The external appearance of the series model of the F-22 
fighter (see figure [figure not reproduced]) did not undergo 
substantial changes. This basically affected design features of 
the airframe and particularly the wing. In the opinion of 
Lockheed specialists, the configuration and external lines of 
the new aircraft became more refined and elegant. 
  A total of 22 changes were made, the main ones being an 
increase in wingspan from 13.32 to 13.50 m, but its area did not 
change (78.32 m[.sup]2[/]) since the leading edge sweep angle 
was reduced from 48 to 42. The latter will permit improving 
the aircraft's maneuver qualities and characteristics of 
cruising flight at subsonic speeds (through reduced aerodynamic 
drag), inasmuch as, according to calculations of U.S. aircraft 
specialists, the optimum wing sweep angle in which maximum roll 
rate is achieved is 40-43. The wing planform presumes a 
reduced radar signature and increased design efficiency. 
  Thickness of the wing root section was reduced to decrease 
drag at high speeds and its camber and twist were changed, which 
improved maneuver characteristics at supersonic flight speeds. 
The sweep of other edges was reduced to 42 similar to the 
wing's leading edge, which provides a decrease in amount of 
radar cross-section. The area of each vertical tail surface was 
changed from 10.13 to 8.27 m[.sup]2[/], which permitted 
reducing aircraft height from 5.4 to 5 m and reducing its drag 
in addition. 
  The program also provides for a number of modifications to 
the Pratt and Whitney F119 engine. In particular, it is planned 
to improve specific fuel consumption indicators in 
nonafterburning conditions when cruising flight is made at 
supersonic speeds (Mach 1.4-1.5). 
  The following are other substantial changes: 

  -  displacement of the air intake edge 46 cm to the rear, 
which improves the aircraft's stability and 
controllability; 
  -  some forward displacement of the pilot cockpit 
and increased bluntness of the nose, which improves the view of 
the forward hemisphere and characteristics of the onboard 
radar; 
  -  a 66 cm decrease in overall length of the aircraft while 
preserving the very same horizontal tail area. 

    It is envisaged building 11 F-22's (nine single-seaters and 
two two-seaters) for $9.55 billion and 33 F119 engines ($1.375 
billion) for full-scale fighter development. It is planned to 
conduct flight tests in these aircraft to evaluate design 
changes. Fabrication of the first series model is planned for 
late 1993. It is planned to reach maximum production rate (48 
aircraft per year) in 2002. According to statements of Pentagon 
representatives, the first air wing (48 F-22's) will gain 
combat-ready status only in 2002. It is planned to purchase a 
total of 684 F-22's for the U.S. Air Force which basically will 
replace F-15 tactical fighters (except for the last F-15E 
modification).

<F P=106> [Article: "Vengeance Through Silence: Is This the Way To Bid </F>
Farewell to the Saviors of the Fatherland on Their Last 
Voyage?"] 
  [Text] On 26 January we buried our comrade-in-arms, a 
participant of the Great Patriotic War, former Chief of General 
Staff of the Armed Forces, Marshal of the Soviet Union, Hero of 
the Soviet Union Nikolay Vasilyevich Ogarkov. Marshal of the 
Soviet Union V. G. Kulikov, General of the Army V. I. 
Varennikov, men who served with Nikolay Vasilyevich in the Great 
Patriotic War, and representatives of veteran and public 
organizations bade a fond farewell to the decedent at his 
funeral in Novodevichye Cemetery. Marshal N. V. Ogarkov's 
funeral was organized by the Ministry of Defense fully in 
accordance with accepted ritual, established procedure, and 
honors. Nonetheless we cannot shake a feeling of anger and 
insult in connection with, mildly speaking, the strange 
inattention to the decedent on the part of other official 
agencies and the mass media. Thus, only KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carried 
a notice of the death of Marshal N. V. Ogarkov, in an obituary 
undersigned by the leadership of the Ministry of Defense. All 
other publications, television and radio (except for the "Mayak" 
program) remained silent as if nothing had happened. For this 
reason thousands of citizens, including many war veterans, did 
not have the opportunity to part with the decedent, and to see 
him off on his final journey. 
  On 27 January only SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and 
VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA carried information on the funeral. Once 
again the other publications were silent. Not a single 
television program devoted a single minute to this funereal 
event on the day of the funeral and on subsequent days. And yet, 
on 26 January television viewers were shown, time and time 
again, the harmless attack by some madman with a starting pistol 
on England's Prince Charles, a lengthy interview with the 
bankrupted former ministers and shock therapists Gaydar and 
Fedorov, and other unimportant stories. But no time or room 
could be found on the airwaves for a broadcast or even a brief 
televised news report on the state--we emphasize the 
state--funeral of a Marshal of the Soviet Union, veteran of the 
Great Patriotic War and Hero of the Soviet Union. In the Sunday, 
30 January "Itogi" program the anchorman uttered not a single 
word about the death and funeral of Marshal N. V. Ogarkov. 
  We feel certain that this is not simply the professional 
neglect of persons in positions of leadership in the mass media, 
and not only a deliberate demonstration of their attitude toward 
the decedent through the method of silence. This is but one 
manifestation and a logical continuation of the discreditation 
of the armed forces, of merited military chiefs, and of veterans 
of the Great Patriotic War who saved the world from fascism, 
begun back in the years of "perestroyka" by certain circles and 
strata of our society, and still going on practically without 
end. 
  As far as Marshal N. V. Ogarkov's funeral is concerned, 
Ogarkov apparently simply cannot be forgotten by some of our 
"reformers" working in government corridors of power and the 
mass media for the fundamental position he took in the years of 
"perestroyka." Everyone remembers his prophetic statement at the 
Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union immediately 
following the events of August 1991, in which Nikolay Vasilyvich 
warned of the danger of the impending disintegration of the 
Soviet Union, in which he turned out to be absolutely correct. 
Nor can they forget N. V. Orgakov for his leadership of the 
Union of War and Labor Veterans, the members of which supported, 
in their overwhelming majority, the attempt by the lawful 
leadership of the Soviet Union in August 1991 to avert the 
trouble into which the country was steadily slipping. Nor could 
the ill-wishers forget Nikolay Vasilyevich for his stern, 
principled protests as inspector general of the armed forces 
against the unjustified "treaties" hastily concluded by 
Gorbachev to reduce, and for practical purposes to disarm the 
army and navy, the division of our mighty Armed Forces of the 
Soviet Union into "sovereign" chunks following the Belovezhskaya 
agreement, and the distribution of military equipment and 
armament, together with personnel, among the new so-called 
"independent" states that appeared suddenly in place of our 
former union republics. 
  We are outraged by the fact that such an insulting attitude 
toward merited military chiefs departing from this life, and 
through them toward the Armed Forces, is being planted in 
Russia. We demand cessation of such a practice, and payment of 
worthy honor to glorious Soviet military chiefs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the State Duma </F>
Security Committee, by Valentin Maslennikov; date and place not 
given: "Without Bias or Timidity" -- first paragraph is 
introduction] 
  [Text] In 20 years Viktor Ilyukhin progressed from 
ordinary investigator in a Penza backwater to first deputy chief 
of a USSR Prosecutor's Office main administration; he headed the 
administration overseeing the application of laws on state 
security. He became politically known after he instituted 
criminal proceedings against Gorbachev, general secretary of the 
then-ruling CPSU, for which he was dismissed from the 
Prosecutor's Office. He is now chairman of the State Duma 
Security Committee. At the editorial office's request Viktor 
Ivanovich shares his thoughts on the plans and prospects for the 
work of this most important section of the new parliament: 
  [Ilyukhin] Many people are troubled by my party membership: 
How come a communist has been elected to such a responsible post 
in a legislative organ of a democratic state? But I do not see 
that this interferes in any way with a collegial organ's 
fruitful work. Incidentally, all three of my deputies belong to 
different parties which society also regards equivocally. 
Viktor Pimenovich Mironov represents "Russia's Choice," Sergey 
Semenovich Boskholov the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and 
Nina Viktorovna Krivelskaya the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia. They are all first-class jurists and professionals in 
the best sense of the word. 
  From the very first steps in our joint work we have set 
aside 
our party bias and sought a common language and mutual 
understanding. The committee has a total of 20 members and the 
volume of work is enormous. It is encouraging that the other 
committee members are also highly qualified jurists. We have 
expert lawyers, people with experience of working in courts and 
internal affairs organs, and attorneys with a wealth of 
practical experience. 
  At our very first session we found out that a collective of 
like minds is forming and that everyone is concerned about one 
thing: The lack of a clear concept of the country's national 
security, thought out in the finest detail. So first of all we 
will be working hard to elaborate one. 
  Not an easy task, because we are faced with a whole range of 
interconnected problems which are difficult to solve. Taking 
national security to mean first of all the consolidation 
of a state's territorial integrity and unity, we are 
singling out four main facets. They are borders, customs, 
federal security services including border troops, and, of 
course, economic security. All this needs to be clearly 
enshrined in legislation. 
  The next set of pressing problems is legal support for 
the fight against crime on the basis of a long-term, 
wide-ranging program which includes scientific substantiation, 
finances, cadre policy, and many other things. 
  The implementation of this program is also directly linked 
with the direct protection of the person and his 
individuality, which we are wont to talk about a lot but 
which we in fact push into the background. So an urgent change 
of emphasis from words to deeds is needed. Incidentally, what 
is required in this respect is a review of the state of 
emergency legislation, which must also protect people first and 
foremost and not be reduced to sharing out authority. 
  Finally, the fourth set is an expert criminological 
assessment of all draft laws passing through the Duma, 
irrespective of who has prepared them. It is up to us to detect 
all the flaws in legislative acts which could substantially 
complicate the criminogenic situation in the country. 
  Of course, the committee will not be able to cope with this 
volume of work alone. We plan to bring in expert specialists 
and scientific subdivisions of practical experts. Discussion 
papers are already available. We are finding good understanding 
in other Duma committees. 
  At the very first session we defined our priority tasks. 
They include finalizing work on the Law on Combating 
Corruption. The attention to this question is easily explained: 
The crime rate is increasing, there is a tidal wave of illegal 
acts, and bribery and mercenary string-pulling have corroded the 
entire state executive mechanism, including the law-enforcement 
organs. This retards any healthy transformations in Russia. 
  Mafia clans are already dictating their policy not only at 
neighborhood level but also in entire cities and oblasts, and in 
some places they are even taking control of legislators' 
activities. This will continue as long as an official at any 
level is dependent on his boss' will and whim. He must obey 
only the law and must serve it faithfully and truly. 
  The law had already been prepared by our predecessors and 
adopted by the Supreme Soviet, but it was not signed by the 
president. In my view the reason is not the shortcomings it 
undoubtedly contains but the struggle between several schools of 
law, whose representatives were unable to agree among themselves 
but were able to persuade the president to postpone the law's 
adoption. Through the efforts of two committees -- ours and the 
one on legislation and judicial reform -- we have already held a 
first hearing on the law and we will soon be submitting it for 
consideration at a Duma session sitting. It cannot be postponed 
any longer. 
  Two other draft laws are next in line -- "On the State 
Protection of Judges and Employees of Law-Enforcement and 
Control Organs" and "On the Protection of Witnesses, Victims, 
and Other People Assisting in Legal Proceedings." They brook no 
delay either. Because judges and MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] employees are being murdered, witnesses and victims are 
being intimidated, and their families are being kept in fear. 
How can a judge or court official who is besieged, totally 
dependent, and lacking life's essentials be objective? What is 
the use of a militiaman who does not feel that he is backed up 
by state protection? How can the evidence of a witness be 
relied on if, outside the precincts of the court, he is not 
protected from the criminals he is accusing? 
  We predict that these laws will not have an easy passage 
through the Duma. Not because deputies do not understand their 
importance and timeliness but because some legislators will 
think that the state cannot afford them at the moment. 
Nevertheless, this expenditure must be made if we seriously 
intend to fight crime and really protect people. 
  The committee has extensive plans. We have a great deal to 
do to improve the criminal and criminal-procedure codes and we 
will be taking part in the drafting of laws on the Prosecutor's 
Office, the legal profession, the Constitutional Court, and many 
other things. 
  I want to single out especially the upcoming work to 
legislatively enshrine the new status of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS]. This is a difficult question 
which will certainly provoke many disputes and disagreements. 
In my opinion the president exceeded his powers by disbanding 
the Security Ministry. The new Constitution does not give him 
the right to autonomously destroy and reform institutions of 
state authority. In place of what is, especially now, a vitally 
essential part of the law-enforcement system yet another 
presidential special service has been formed. There are too 
many of them as it is. 
  Something similar can be observed with the MVD. Essentially 
the enforcement structures are being removed from Prosecutor's 
Office oversight and judicial and parliamentary control, and 
levers of authoritarian power are being strengthened. During 
its reorganization the FCS lost its investigation apparatus. 
This is a blow to its capability. The shield remains but the 
sword has been taken away. 
  I grant that some people will not agree with me, but I will 
defend my opinion both inside and outside committee sessions. A 
considerable number of these complex debates lie ahead of us. 
  Just take the question of borders. It is no longer possible 
to put up with the large-meshed sieve into which they have now 
turned. But to construct new ones will require at least five to 
seven years of intensive work and expenditure equal to twice or 
three times Russia's annual budget (without drinking, eating, or 
spending a cent on anything else). There is one solution: To 
agree with our close neighbors on a single external CIS border. 
  They cannot protect it by themselves -- as eloquently 
demonstrated by Tajikistan's experience. That means that we 
must form joint border troops -- which requires an interstate 
accord. We must not shy away from each other but act hand in 
hand. What is of help here is both our historical experience 
and the recognition of the prospect of the inevitable 
unification of the collapsed Union on a new basis. 
  West Europe's experience indicates the same: Strength 
through 
unification. Most of our countries' inhabitants think the same: 
Because they were cut for real when they were separated, borders 
were drawn through families and futures. In my opinion the only 
obstacle now is leaders' political ambitions. 
  I by no means want to switch the conversation about our 
committee's plans to the political plane. But when national 
security is being discussed there is no escaping politics. Our 
committee does not consider itself to be exceeding its powers in 
putting forward some urgent demands and recommendations to the 
Federal Assembly, the country's government, and the Russian 
president. In particular, in order to achieve our national 
security the country's and the Foreign Ministry's leaders must 
urgently agree with all CIS countries that the latter will not 
wholly or partly join any military bloc opposing Russia. And I 
believe that a strict demand should be put to our Baltic 
neighbors: One of the mandatory conditions for the withdrawal 
of our troops from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia is a pledge on 
their part not to join any military bloc with other states and 
not to allow foreign military bases to be located on their 
territory. 
  So, the tasks facing our committee are complex and crucial, 
just like the concept of security itself.

the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation: "The Generals Were

  [Text] 
<H3>  How the Army Found Itself Forced To Fire Upon the People for 
26 Hours in a Row in October 1993 </H3>
  General of the Army K. Kobets, people's deputy of the 
Russian 
Federation, dropped into my office during the first half of the 
day on 20 September. He reported that a session of the Collegium 
of the Ministry of Defense had just concluded, which was 
attended by many commanders of troop arms and military 
districts. K. Kobets informed me that the session had been 
convened at the initiative of the Minister and at B. Yeltsin's 
instructions. The Army's participation in possible armed events 
in the city of Moscow was discussed. There was discussion of the 
possibility of establishing direct presidential control in the 
nation on 20 or 21 September, and it was proposed that the 
Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet of the 
Russian Federation be dispersed. This would be formalized in a 
message from the President to the people and in a corresponding 
decree. This could result in various extreme acts and armed 
confrontations. Nothing was said about who was to be fought and 
who was to be protected, however. Many Collegium members were 
absolutely opposed to the Army's participation in the 
suppression of street disturbances. This was the function of the 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Troops. Obviously 
anticipating the course of events, the Minister of Defense 
attempted to convince the Collegium members that it might be 
necessary to move troops into Moscow. 
  "During our discussion a phone call came in on the direct 
line from the President. I could not hear what Yeltsin said. We 
could only see," K. Kobets said, "that after the words `Just 
what would you have me to do? Take the `White House' by storm? 
The Army is outside of politics. You have repeatedly said so 
yourself!' the Minister's face turned very red and he was not 
feeling well. They hung up at the other end. The Minister went 
into another room and took some medicine. Some time later he 
returned. The Collegium members and those present unanimously 
decided to observe strict neutrality and not be drawn into any 
street disturbances." 
  After listening to General K. Kobets, I asked him to report 
on the session of the Ministry of Defense Collegium to R. 
Khazbulatov, and he headed for there. 
  I would like to deviate somewhat here from the chronology of 
events. Special circumstances had brought me into contact with 
General K. Kobets and certain other generals. It so happened 
that from the very beginning of my chairmanship of the 
Commission on the Budget, Plans, Taxes and Prices and then my 
deputy chairmanship of the Supreme Soviet, hardly not a week 
went by in which the heads of the MO [Ministry of Defense], the 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the MB [Ministry of 
Security] did not come to me, mainly on matters pertaining to 
legislative support for the functioning of those agencies, their 
financing, material and technical support, decisions on the 
induction of the youth into the army and so forth. Before 
becoming a member of the Supreme Soviet I worked at defense 
enterprises in Tataria and then in the Defense Section of the 
Tatarsk Oblast party committee. 
  I was frequently in the forces, at various military 
anniversaries, and took part in formal and family dinners with 
the generals. They all spoke aloud, without inhibition, of the 
absence of a precisely defined military doctrine in the nation, 
talked with suffering about the army's disintegration and the 
decline of its prestige in the world arena. The only thing they 
discussed in a lowered voice was who had control of the nuclear 
button. God forbid that someone should hear that. Nor were they 
secretive about the causes of the crisis: "What kind of minister 
do we have"? He was referred to with the same extremely 
diminutive name used for him throughout the army. This was not 
familiarity; it was a reflection of the pinnacle of competence. 
No one referred to Generals Kolesnikov, Mironov or Deynikin in a 
familiar, simplified manner. They were personalities, although 
they too were caught up in the "Rodionov syndrome" at a crucial 
time for Russia. There was nothing surprising about that; the 
army was torn down, persecuted, degraded and insulted on all 
sides. 
  I would point out that this syndrome came into being in the 
army following the Tbilisi tragedy, in which neo-democrat 
Sobchak left a black mark. What rage and what thunderbolts he 
leveled against the command element of the Transcaucasus 
Military District and the Ministry of Defense as a People's 
Deputy of the USSR! And it was, after all, thanks to the army 
that a terrible bloodbath was avoided in Georgia back then, on 9 
April 1989. A large disaster was prevented then. Later, this was 
no longer possible; the army was forced to take a "neutral 
position." Let the result be judged by those who at this 
difficult time either remained silent or capitulated to 
"democrat" Sobchak or took up his position without realizing it, 
"falling in love with" the sparkling eyes of this destroyer of 
the nation. 
  Ultimately, what began with Sobchak's offering led to the 
Army's direct breakdown. The U.S. has long exercised control 
over Russia's key areas, of course: politics and the economy. It 
has now reached even the Army. Many people are probably aware 
that during Minister of Defense P. Grachev's visit to the U.S. 
agreement was reached on the establishment of a joint 
American-Russian "peacekeeping" force out of the U.S. 3rd 
Infantry Division and Russia's 27th Motorized-Rifle Division. 
The most amazing thing is that the Russian Minister agreed to 
the possibility of their use in the CIS countries during a 
"special period." If, during the recent fall, victory had gone 
to the Constitution and the Congress of People's Deputies, the 
possibility cannot be ruled out that Russians would have "gotten 
to known" firsthand American rapid-reaction forces at strategic 
CIS facilities: atomic power plants, nuclear installations and 
so forth. 
  ...The phone on the direct line to R. Khazbulatov rang. He 
asked us to come to his office immediately. Present there were 
Colonel-General M. Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, 
People's Deputy of Russia V. Achadov, advisor on Military 
Affairs to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian 
Federation, Vice President A. Rutskoy and A. Korovnikov, 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet Committee. M. Kolesnikov had 
already reported to them on the session of the Collegium of the 
Ministry of Defense. 
  "Mikhail Petrovich has just told us about the session of the 
Ministry of Defense Collegium. Everything K. Kobets said is 
confirmed. The Army will adhere to the concept that it is 
'outside of politics,'" R. Khazbulatov said. "What are we going 
to do"? 
  "We need officially to summon the Minister of Defense to the 
Supreme Soviet and clarify the situation," someone said. Grachev 
was not to be found an hour after that or later, however. Nor 
did he respond to attempts to contact him. We asked M. 
Kolesnikov jointly with K. Kobets to write a report to the 
Supreme Soviet. The Chief of the General Staff promised to write 
the report and bring it to us in an hour. R. Khazbulatov later 
told me that M. Kolesnikov came to see him an hour later and 
confirmed everything orally but refused to prepare a written 
document. From that moment the Army began slowly but certainly 
to enter into the scenario of a coup d'etat, first demonstrating 
neutrality toward B. Yeltsin's unconstitutional actions (and 
this actually played into his hand) and then taking action in 
support of the putsch. 
  Throughout all those days, right up until I left the House 
of 
Soviets, I spoke with K. Kobets by phone three or four times a 
day. Like us, he was upset by the fact that the lights had been 
turned off, there was no hot water and it was not permitted to 
bring in fuel, food or medicine. He believed that this was being 
done by brainless blockheads to get the people to rise up and 
come to the House of Soviets. 
  For my part, I too complained that power and telephone lines 
had been disconnected in the Ministry of Defense on 23 
September, organic weapons had been taken from ministry workers 
and generals, and two guards from other departments had been 
posted at each door. And the generals tolerated this, quietly 
and timidly discussing the issues raised by the political 
crisis. The situation surrounding the Ministry of Defense was 
heating up, and it was impossible not to see this. The degree of 
secrecy in the Army increased by the day. M.P. Kolesnikov, chief 
of the General Staff, issued a special document altering the 
procedure for telephone communication between the central 
agencies of military command and control and the troops. This 
was unprecedented in peacetime. It essentially meant that 
Ministry of Defense staff could not independently contact a 
single military subunit (division, regiment) even on a secure 
line. Only the chief of the corresponding staff of the troop arm 
could issue the order, after learning the content of the 
forthcoming discussion. 
  All of this shows that neither B. Yeltsin nor P. Grachev was 
certain how the Army, including the top generals, would conduct 
themselves in that non-authorized situation which developed 
after 21 September. They were attempting not only to prevent the 
"leakage of information" but also to make it difficult for the 
opponents of Yeltsin and Grachev in the Ministry itself to join 
forces. 
  Was General K. Kobets aware of this? I believe he was. At 
least one fact led me to doubt it. 
  Some Secretariat staff members came to the office and told 
me: 
  "Look, Yuriy Mikhaylovich, General K. Kobets is allegedly in 
touch with events on Leningradskiy Prospekt and is giving an 
interview at the Headquarters of the CIS Joint Armed Forces, 
stating that the Army is being ordered to shoot at people. 
  "That cannot be," I replied, although I was beginning to 
have 
doubts. People could not make up such things. 
  I phoned K. Kobets and was told by his orderly: 
  "He is at the General Staff and will not be back soon. As 
soon as he arrives, I shall put him through to you." 
  I phoned Kobets' dacha. His wife answered. Since we are on 
friendly terms, we chatted for a awhile, and I asked her whether 
she had heard Konstantin Ivanovich's TV presentation. 
  "No," she answered, "I did not. He is in some kind of mess 
again." 
  Much to my surprise, some time later I was told that 
Minister 
Grachev had personally played back a recording of our 
conversation for General K. Kobets as proof of his wife's 
"underground" activities and apparently hinted that his phone 
was also being tapped. 
  Even in that situation we still considered it more 
acceptable 
to use the Army in the capacity of "blue helmets" for separating 
the "White House" and the police. Up to the tragic events of 3-4 
October Russia's people's deputies, the heads of Federation 
subjects and the leaders of trade unions and parties did not 
believe that the government could make a decision to storm the 
House of Soviets. 
  Unfortunately, independent experts with contacts with the 
President's administration and with the power structures 
maintained the opposite. The scenario had been worked out long 
before. According to Yeltsin, the "artillery preparation" was 
over. Only the actual storming remained. The date for it was 
postponed from one day to the next. The breakthrough of the 
blockade and the storming of important facilities (which ones 
was another question) had been set forth in the scenario and 
repeatedly approved. A game of nerves began. 
  Beginning on 22 September telegrams began coming in to the 
Supreme Soviet and to R. Khazbulatov personally from the 
military district commanders, in which they proposed a "zero 
option" and simultaneous, early elections for the President and 
the Supreme Soviet. This concept later became the basis of the 
negotiating process at the Saint Daniel Monastery. I also 
informed K. Kobets of this. The "zero option" demanded great 
courage of the authors of Decree No. 1400, however. After all, 
it actually involved rescinding it or suspending it if worse 
came to worst. We understood all of the political complexity 
involved in such a decision, particularly for B. Yeltsin and 
those around him, but we were hoping they would be sensible for 
the sake of Russia. Unfortunately, our hopes were not justified. 
  Representatives of the General Staff and of the military 
districts made their way to the Supreme Soviet, particularly in 
the first stage, who, like P. Deynikin, M. Kolesnikov and V. 
Mironov, declared that they understood the political situation, 
understood that an unconstitutional coup d'etat had been carried 
out but that they would not intervene yet but wait to see how 
events developed. Too many times the politicians had coerced the 
Army in the past and then abandoned and made scapegoats of the 
generals. 
  On Sunday night a group of officers from one of the units in 
the Moscow PVO [Air Defense] District led by a colonel went over 
to the side of the parliament. In an interview with an Interfax 
correspondent inside the House of Soviets, the servicemen, who 
requested that they not be named, gave as the motive for their 
decision their absolute disagreement with B. Yeltsin's position. 
According to them, many other servicemen in their unit had also 
expressed a desire to go to the "White House", but the officers 
had not wanted to draw first-term servicemen into the conflict. 
The officers confirmed the fact that the Army was split but that 
it must defend the Constitution. 
  It was apparent that following promulgation of the 21 
September decree and the execution of the coup d'etat, Yeltsin's 
team had seen that it did not have the necessary support either 
in Moscow or regionally. The Muscovites, who staged numerous 
demonstrations and rallies, were on the side of the House of 
Soviets. Consequently, the Army and its leadership would still 
have to be "broken." Only the excuse was needed, an act of great 
provocation. And this soon occurred: the "breakthrough" by 
Muscovites of the ring blockading the House of Soviets, the 
"storming" of the mayor's office, "Ostankino." I underscore the 
fact: Those were acts of provocation. 
  "Everyone," A. Rutskoy said, "is drawing the Army to the 
`White House.'" 
  "But then General K. Kobets promised to use it only in the 
capacity of `blue helmets.'" 
  "I do not believe your Kobets or Grachev! They betrayed us 
once, and they will do it again. I was told," A. Rutskoy said, 
"that there is a split in the Ministry of Defense leadership 
over the use of the Army and its introduction into Moscow. 
Pashka is calling the divisions and regiments himself, over the 
heads of the commanders. And your beloved People's Deputy K. 
Kobets agreed to head an operational group to stabilize the 
situation in the city, which actually means firing upon the 
peaceful population. It is at his orders that aimed fire is 
being leveled against the House of Soviets." 
  Indeed, at a session of the Collegium of the Ministry of 
Defense held on the night of 3 October, a number of district 
commanders expressed their disagreement with the President's 
orders pertaining to supporting the status of the extraordinary 
situation in Moscow. All evening and all night from Sunday to 
Monday the President attempted to convince the generals of the 
need for a final assault on the House of Soviets. P. Grachev and 
K. Kobets did not need to be convinced; they agreed with it all. 
  What was A. Rutskoy to reply? We heard over a special radio 
unit that armored personnel carriers and personnel of the 
Kremlin and Tula airborne divisions had begun moving toward 
Moscow. Subunits of the Ryazan Airborne Division were being 
moved up. 
  We saw all of this at 07:00 on the morning of 4 October. 
Breaking through the barricades near the parliament building, 
five BMP penetrated to Free Russia Square and moved to the 
opposite side of the square. The armored personnel carriers and 
infantry combat vehicles began shelling the barricades and tents 
and opened fire at windows in the House of Soviets. The first 
round razed a tent on the square with sleeping Muscovites 
inside. Three bodies were left lying on the street. 
  Subunits of the Tula Airborne Division, which had taken the 
place of the police and soldiers in the internal troops, closed 
the ring around the House of Soviets. At 08:30 the soldiers 
began approaching the building in bounds, while the armored 
personnel carriers and infantry combat vehicles opened fire on 
the parliament building. Ten tanks from the Kantemir Division 
were moved onto the bridge and the opposite side of the Moscow 
River to provide fire support. After several volleys fire broke 
out on the 12th and 13th floor of the House of Soviets. 
  Over police radio R. Khazbulatov, Father Nikon and I 
constantly called upon the troops to cease fire and begin 
negotiations. The response was nothing but verbal abuse and a 
disinclination to engage in any sort of dialog. The artillery 
fire intensified. The movement of troops, equipment and police 
forces in the direction of the House of Soviets increased by the 
hour. Reinforcements were constantly joining them. Most of the 
fire on the "White House" came from the direction of the 
American embassy, from the Hotel Mir and the quay near the Hotel 
Ukraina. Snipers plastered anything moving inside the "White 
House" from all sides. 
  A transition from a democratic regime to authoritarian rule 
had actually occurred in Russia. Tanks fired on the Supreme 
Soviet to the applause of world "civilization" and the approving 
yells of neo-democrats. 
  I phoned K. Kobets' headquarters once more. Colonel-General 
D. Volkogonov, people's deputy of the Russian Federation, picked 
up the phone. In a cold and steel-edged voice he told me: 
  "The situation has changed. The President has signed an 
order 
as Supreme Commander-in-Chief to the Minister of Defense on the 
storming of the House of Soviets and has assumed full 
responsibility. We shall quell the putsch at any cost. Army 
forces will establish order in Moscow. 
  When the people's deputies of Russia were led out of the 
House of Soviets and were standing on the central, marble 
staircase, many of them asked one another: "Why did they shell 
the 'White House' in such a ruthless, demonstrative and 
ostentatious manner"? So much has been written in the mass media 
on the possibility of taking such buildings with special-purpose 
forces and Alfa and Vympel subunits, without artillery or 
outside fire. All the more since Alfa leaders and Deputy 
Minister of Security V. Stepashin gave assurances that 30-40 
minutes would be enough to take the building. We had experience: 
the capture of the royal palace in Kabul and the operations in 
Ossetia and Ingushetia. There were therefore other objectives. A 
scenario worked out long before was being played out. 
  All of us clearly understood that the shelling and the fire 
in the "White House" was an expensive show, a drama, staged on a 
grand scale for the West. "See, respected colleagues, how much 
work and bloodshed we have endured to achieve democracy and the 
opportunity to continue the political and economic reforms, 
while you keep waving promises in front of our faces but do not 
provide financial assistance. This is not gentlemanly"! 
  The writers of the scenario forgot, however, that the House 
of Soviets would remain in the mind of the population not just 
in Russia but in the entire former USSR as the champion of their 
interests, the interests of Russian-language citizens. The 
Russians remember well who has betrayed them and how many times. 
  Why are those who came to defend the Constitution and the 
law 
during those terrible days from the Dniester Region, the Baltic 
area and Central Asia regarded as butchers? By issuing the 
unconstitutional Decree No. 1400 on the coup d'etat and 
announcing that force would be used to break up the Supreme 
Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies, B. Yeltsin himself 
created all of the circumstances necessary for the arrival at 
the House of Soviets not just of the supporting mass of 
peaceable people with a certain political orientation but also 
people prepared to defend the Constitution and the parliament 
being dispersed, bearing weapons. 
  In the minds of the Russians the House of Soviets continues 
to represent the citadel of the Congress of PEOPLE'S (I 
particularly underscore that) Deputies. And the neo-democrats 
wanted very much to erase the memory of the Supreme Soviet from 
the minds of the people. In the minds of the Russians they were 
firing on their memories. It is not surprising that the 
government made haste in this matter as well. It adopted a 
decision to perform restoration work in the "White House" by 
November 1994 and to use the building as the center of 
government. History will hardly forget that no matter who is 
housed in that building, it is still the House of Soviets, that 
it was there that an act of vandalism was perpetrated in the 
public view, the shelling of Russia. 
  And now... the awarding of the order For Personal Valor to 
Army Gen Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev, minister of defense of the 
Russian Federation, and Konstantin Ivanovich Kobets, deputy 
minister of defense of the Russian Federation, for valor and 
heroism exhibited in the suppression of armed attempts at a coup 
d'etat in Moscow on 3-4 October 1993. I am pained by the cynical 
use of the lofty words "valor" and "heroism" in this Decree. 
There is no such thing as heroes who fire upon the people.

<F P=106> [Article by Col A. Petrov under the rubric "The People's </F>
Army": "Why the Democrats Fear the Army"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Serve the Fatherland! </H5>
  Television and the press are again vigorously raking the 
Army 
over the coals. This time for supporting Zhirinovskiy in the 
election. We already know that the "free, democratic press" does 
nothing without first clearing its actions with a certain center 
for the coordination of propaganda campaigns. 
  Why have certain sages among the democrats suddenly begun 
devoting so much attention to the army? Is it not because recent 
events have shown that democracy still lacks the strength to 
make a statement in internal affairs and some people are afraid 
it will make a statement on its own? Fear for their own skins 
put all the "zealots for the people" into a state of panic 
following the election. 
  Having despicably forced the Army to take part in the 
October 
bloodshed, the timeservers decided that they could treat the 
army like a prostitute. But no, despite the participation by 
several units and formations in the unconstitutional putsch, the 
mood in the army as a whole did not become one of greater 
loyalty to the regime. On the contrary, there was a hatred in 
the Army for those who provoked it to commit bloodshed! 
  When speaking of the Army, it is impossible not to mention 
the participation of fightingmen in the execution of the legal 
authorities, a matter painful to the heart of every honorable 
officer and enlisted man. I am not in a position to make a legal 
assessment of the crime. This must be done at the official, 
state level by experienced legal experts. As an officer I am 
merely trying to understand the moral and ethical motivation of 
those who were forced (just that, forced--with the exception of 
a few scoundrels) to carry out the unconstitutional orders. 
  What was the core around which the entire life and the 
career 
of the Russian, a Russian officer, was based, structured and 
transpired? It was certainly not his earnings. There has never 
been a time in the history of Russia or the USSR when an officer 
received very high pay rates. Read the memoirs of the old 
Russian generals and other officers. Within our memory, in the 
"stagnant" past, the officer's pay was comparable to that of a 
skilled worker. And any merchant today receives many times the 
earnings of an officer. Furthermore, the former does not remain 
on duty day and night at a range, does not operate in a state of 
constant nervous tension in a missile silo or on a submarine or 
a missile-carrier, does not run forth in the face of bullets 
somewhere in Central Asia or the Transcaucasus. This means that 
it is not material benefit which has screened these people but a 
strength commensurate with the difficulties and dangers. Russian 
historian L.N. Gumilev defined it as "zeal." 
  As applied to the officer, it is a desire to realize his 
vital aspirations in the military, in service to the state and 
the people. It was precisely an orientation toward the state 
which constituted the dominant imperative in the shaping of the 
officers' world outlook. Beginning at the end of the '80s, 
however, this core first lost its stability and then, with the 
collapse of the Union, became an ephemeral element. The most 
unstable, career-minded, essentially marginal portion of the 
officer corps set out on a course openly betraying their duty, 
the army and the state. One need only to recall the exposure of 
commercial activities being engaged in by higher command 
personnel in the Western Group of Forces, in certain fleets, in 
the aviation and the districts. 
  I feel that this development has had an extremely 
demoralizing effect upon the army, possibly even greater than 
when the Gorbachev government betrayed the army in Tbilisi and 
Vilnius; greater than the dirty, vile campaign in which 
democratized elements in the mass media accused the army of all 
the sins of the universe. 
  The force of cultivated traditions is so great, however, 
that 
even in today's extremely difficult circumstances the large part 
of the officer corps continue conscientiously to bear their 
cross. 
  It was precisely the reflexive force of discipline which 
forced most of those officers who entered Moscow bearing weapons 
to submit to the unconstitutional orders, since the orders 
emanated from those groups to which the army is subordinate, the 
state leadership. Habit is second nature. 
  The fact that the introduction of troops into Moscow was 
effected with typically authoritarian methods also played a 
role. General Kondratyev, deputy defense minister, issued orders 
directly to the commanders of the 2nd and 4th divisions and the 
27th brigade (I deliberately and for perfectly understandable 
reasons omit the word "Guards" in their names). Furthermore, 
commanders at all levels were forbidden to give any information 
to staff members of the district, which was not informed of the 
introduction of subordinate troops into Moscow. The ban was 
lifted only after the defenders of the parliament were 
suppressed. How do you like that? The leadership of the Ministry 
of Defense does not even trust the district command element and 
its staff! We can see that fear predominates in the sentiments 
of the upper level even there. Fear forced the Ministry of 
Security to be destroyed, but since the Army cannot be treated 
that way, we should anticipate some personnel changes in the 
leadership of the Ministry of Defense and the districts, 
primarily the Moscow district. 
  With respect to the prestige of leaders of the state and the 
Army in the military, its value is vanishingly small, as the 
mathematicians say. The October events turned against Yeltsin 
even those few officers who still harbored certain illusions 
about him. The most unfortunate thing is the fact that none of 
the prominent military leaders, either of the present or from 
the past, enjoys absolute or even predominant prestige among the 
officers. 
  And so, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
  that the Army as a special institution of the state is 
presently incapable of performing its main function, with the 
exception of the nuclear forces; 
  that the Army is still capable of exerting a major influence 
upon the outcome of events inside the country; and that its role 
can be either fatal or rejuvenating; 
  that the Army in the person of its officer corps absolutely 
rejects the present regime; 
  that the Army is not yet a unified, unequivocally 
like-minded 
organism; it has not acquired a leader, and this is a major 
destabilizing factor. 
  One can predict events to come. There is no doubt that a 
narrow group of rulers will continue to implement "their" plan 
for subordinating the nation to the West, no matter what the 
cost. Resistance in the people to this course is great and 
continues to grow. Support for the regime will be sought in 
so-called power structures. The Ministry of Security was 
destroyed, and for some time these agencies will not have the 
capacity seriously to influence the situation. The army's 
antipathy toward the regime is indisputable, but the inertia of 
subordination is still great. Only the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] is capable of providing support, a fact demonstrated by 
past events. It is with good reason that this ministry's 
strength is presently being vigorously built up. More than 20 
percent of the draftees within the MVO [Moscow Military 
District] are destined for the MVD. This is an unprecedented 
figure. 
  Considering the inconsistent position taken by the Army (not 
to be confused with the leadership of the Ministry of Defense), 
state-minded, patriotic forces, organizations and leaders should 
interact more closely with the officer corps. In no case should 
we repeat the errors of the past, when it was taken for granted 
that the army would refuse to employ weapons, and based on those 
groundless hopes almost no work was performed with it. The fuss 
raised by certain officer organizations found the bulk of the 
officer corps indifferent. The main stress in working with the 
army should be on appealing to its state-oriented, patriotic 
instinct. The origins of most officers in the people and their 
basic linkage with the people should be stressed to the 
maximum--not an abstract but a concrete people gasping from the 
current difficulties but still supporting the army which 
betrayed it in October of '93. We need to promote constantly, 
persistently and purposefully the concept that a Russian, a 
Russian officer, if he is a real officer, is incapable of 
lifting a hand against a compatriot or against legal authority.

<F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent Aleksandr Yegorov, </F>
under the rubric: "Arsenal"; "The `Gyurza' Has a Stern Nature"] 
  [Text] In a recent article, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA discussed 
the equipment and arms exhibition in Turkey. Special attention 
was devoted to the "small-arms" section presented by Russia. 
Besides similar models, you mentioned the "Gyurza" 9-mm pistol 
set. Could you discuss this weapon in more detail? 
  Aleksandr Vlasov 
  Krasnodar 
  Despite the modest dimensions and limited combat 
significance 
of this type of weapon, the history of the pistol is the history 
of the dramatic struggle of a designer's idea and the 
capabilities of the technology. Frankly speaking, until recently 
there hasn't been an ideal pistol in the world. There were 
simply successful and popular models: the Browning, the Mauser, 
the Colt, the TT [Tokarev Tula pistol]... But, based upon the 
big picture, they remained a weak weapon of destruction. Small 
weapons are acquiring force only right now. The pistol that we 
are discussing today is actually a powerful weapon that meets 
very high combat requirements. 
  They named it "Gyurza" [Persian -- gurza -- a type of 
poisonous snake], probably because there is little chance of 
pulling through after a "bite". As Mauser the younger once said, 
Inventor and State Prize Laureate Petr Serdyukov, in cooperation 
with Aleksey Yuryev (the cartridge designer), managed to 
accommodate so much death and force in the space called "Gyurza" 
that the pistol can legitimately be considered to be one of the 
best, if not the best, in its class. But let's let the technical 
specifications speak for themselves.

  One of the main specifications is effective firing range. 
For 
"Gyurza", it is 100 meters (as we know, the PM [9 mm pistol 
designed by Makarov] has a range of 25 meters). It is from this 
distance that the pistol permits us to destroy an enemy who is 
protected by a helmet. At a range of up to 70 meters, "Gyurza's" 
bullet pierces a flak jacket (two titanium plates 1.2 mm thick 
each and 30 layers of Kevlar). No other pistol is capable of 
doing that today. 
  "Gyurza" is equipped with two automatic safeties which is an 
innovation. One is located on the trigger (a pin that depresses 
when squeezed) and the other is on the handle. The safeties are 
turned off when the pistol is grasped properly by a hand, 
thereby excluding the possibility of delays when opening fire 
that are characteristic for a standard pistol and which are 
associated with a forward safety in the fighting position, or 
the possibility of the pistol becoming stuck in the holster, 
caught on clothing, etc. 
  The new pistol permits you to conduct fire when the hammer 
is 
placed in the fully cocked platoon. 
  There is a horn, a bend in the trigger guard, or, as they 
call it here, a support for the other hand. That is also an 
innovation that facilitates firing the powerful pistol. However, 
experience has shown that firing the "Gyurza" one-handed is also 
adequately effective. A pistol shooter with a medium level of 
training hits a full-length target no less than 16 of 18 
possible times at a range of 100 meters. 
  It remains to be added that the pistol was developed at the 
Central NII of Precision Machinebuilding and is entering the 
inventory of MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] special subunits.

<F P=106> ["Topical interview" with Gennadiy Voronin, chairman of the </F>
Russian Federation State Committee for Defense Sectors of 
Industry, by Vladimir Gundarov; date and place not given: 
"Russia's Naval Prestige Bound To Sink Below `Red' Line" -- 
first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] Gennadiy Petrovich Voronin is an academician of the 
International Engineering Academy, a doctor of economical 
sciences, a member of the British Institute of Naval Engineers, 
an honored machine builder of Russia, and a State Prize winner. 
He is deputy chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee 
for Defense Sectors of Industry. 
  [Gundarov] Gennadiy Petrovich, you have devoted all your 
life to shipbuilding and you are well acquainted with all the 
stages of boom and decline in the Russian Navy's history. In 
your opinion what kind of stage is it going through now? 
  [Voronin] A stage of decline, of course. It takes time to 
do what we have to do to overcome this stage in accordance with 
the new military doctrine -- with smaller numbers but higher 
quality, as the saying goes. But so far there has not been 
enough time for the Navy to acquire new qualities, that is for 
it to obtain new, high-precision weapons, more modern ships and 
command and control systems, and so on. Speaking in broad 
terms, we currently have no military equipment program, whereas 
in the past we had plans for 10-15 years in advance. 
  [Gundarov] Just how long do we still have to wait? 
  [Voronin] We have been waiting for a program for over 18 
months. It has now been finalized and signed, but it is not yet 
an official document which could be sent to our plants. I think 
it will be approved in the first quarter of this year. But the 
program is not dogma. Obviously it will still be subject to 
amendment, hopefully in the direction of increasing the fleet's 
combat strength. 
  [Gundarov] The press has repeatedly expressed the opinion 
that the current reduction in the number of Navy ships is the 
consequence not only of the USSR's geopolitical disintegration 
and the economic crisis in Russia, but also of mistakes made in 
drawing up the preceding shipbuilding programs.... 
  [Gundarov] Everything can be doubted and criticized with the 
benefit of hindsight. For example, many people say that we 
should not have built aircraft carriers; they say it was too 
expensive. But what is cheap? At that historical stage, given 
the military doctrine and given the confrontation with NATO and 
in particular with the United States, our shipbuilding program 
designed to take us through the year 2000 was, I believe, 
correct. It was elaborated and approved at collegiums of 
various ministries: defense, shipbuilding, and others. 
  I do not deny that mistakes are made in any business. We 
sometimes philosophize that everything should be decided 
collectively -- by some kind of oblast committees, soviets, or 
collegiums. Nevertheless the role of the individual will, I 
think, always influence specific decisions. Recently I went to 
America and England and saw how things are done there. There 
the role of the individual, judging by what happens, is simply 
staggering. Although outwardly it is less noticeable, maybe 
because everyone there has more freedom. 
  [Gundarov] We are now in Russia, where there have always 
been people with a preference for certain types of ship. So it 
would be interesting to find out which ships you have a 
preference for. 
  [Voronin] I have a preference for the Navy as a whole. I 
have carefully studied U.S. naval doctrine. By the year 2000 
their combat effectiveness will have increased 100 percent. Not 
through the number of ships but through the quality of new 
weapons and power-generating systems, in short, through science. 
Everything there is resolved in a comprehensive manner. At the 
same time it should be noted that many countries have decided to 
build small aircraft carriers designed to take 15-20 
Harrier-type aircraft. I believe that we too should have these 
aircraft carriers in the Northern and Pacific Fleets. They 
could be built in St. Petersburg or Severodvinsk. We have the 
stocks on which to do that. 
  But I am concerned by what the Americans are doing now while 
we are doing nothing. We have started work to salvage old ships 
and submarines. While the United States is practically ceasing 
its involvement in salvaging and is converting old ships into 
training ships. A ship can be made ready for combat again 
within a month or two. 
  [Gundarov] Do you yourself believe that? 
  [Voronin] Generally it is hard to believe in something 100 
percent. But I know that the work is being done. I do not 
think that they will be able to convert all old ships into 
training ships, but here we often write off even quite new ships 
for scrap. 
  [Gundarov] For example, the aircraft carrying cruiser Kiev? 
  [Voronin] Its fate has still not been decided, but it is 
predetermined. 
  [Gundarov] Why can we not take the same road as the 
Americans? 
  [Voronin] We are probably prevented from doing so by a kind 
of "special Russian genotype." All the time we are trying to 
make economies without investing money in anything. In two 
years we have not built a single surface ship. But the problem 
of repairing old ships is not being solved either. So far only 
the salvaging of submarines has been "stoked up" because 
ship-repair plants, which have no other orders at present, have 
clutched at this work like a straw. 
  [Gundarov] What is in store for the Navy in the near future? 
  [Voronin] We have worked out a program through 2003 in which 
we have taken account of the new military doctrine's demands. 
The program is based above all on the real situation in 
industry. Every plant has a so-called "red" technological line 
below which the plant must not go, in order to prevent the 
disintegration of production sectors. The illogical thing is 
that conversion has proceeded apace, that is, it has been 
several times greater than that originally planned. For 
example, we have enterprises where the main production decreased 
80 percent in one year. In this situation no economic formula 
works any more. That is why, when elaborating the economic 
program, we took as our basis the task of maintaining 
production. But even our minimal program, it turned out, costs 
four times as much as the budget available to the Defense 
Ministry. I know that the Defense Ministry is currently 
battling with the Finance and Economy Ministries. To avoid a 
total collapse we have been forced to take a risk: To put new 
systems, instruments, and units into production without having 
official documents for doing so. 
  [Gundarov] Are you not afraid that in five years or so 
people will at best start criticizing you for building ships 
without a program and therefore for making more mistakes? 
  [Voronin] There is something else that we have to fear: 
Being accused of doing nothing. After all, science cannot be 
stopped, but what we are doing is not essential. We know how 
and on what a potential enemy is working, how a process is 
proceeding throughout the world, and what new systems, component 
base, and new technologies are being developed. Of course, we 
too are compelled to carry out this work, but, it turns out, 
with our eyes shut. 
  [Gundarov] Still, is it not easier to work with our eyes 
open, even if on a minimal program? 
  [Voronin] I do not want to reveal all our secrets. I will 
merely note that an enterprise which has been able to get into a 
foreign market and make a dollar profit uses it not for its own 
social needs but for finding solutions to state tasks, including 
scientific developments. We are hard-put to compete with the 
Japanese, who already have the fifth generation of radio 
electronics in production -- molecular electronics and 
biocomputers. But should we not at least keep our finger on the 
pulse? Irrespective of whether the new parliament gives money 
or not. That is life. 
  [Gundarov] At the moment Russia has no enemies, politicians 
claim. Maybe the need to build new ships intensively has also 
ceased? 
  [Voronin] Sometimes I am asked a simple "peasant" question: 
Why can U.S. submarines dart around Severodvinsk while we cannot 
do the same near their country? Moreover, the opposing side 
refuses to hold any talks on cutting naval forces, considering 
itself a great naval power and guarantor of peace. Not only the 
United States is looking after its fleet. Work to build up 
China's naval forces has now been launched as never before. 
Hundreds of representatives of various firms and departments in 
that country are coming to us. I have met many of them and 
formed the conclusion that they have set themselves the task of 
making their country one of the most powerful naval powers in 
the near future. Recently I visited South Korea, where I met the 
president of the "Khala" [as translaiterated] firm. In 18 
months they intend to construct a new state-of-the-art shipyard. 
South Korea is currently the world's second biggest shipbuilder 
and will probably soon be the biggest. Even that small country 
intends to begin building submarines -- diesel submarines for 
the time being. While China is already interested in 
nuclear-powered submarines. Those two countries' strategy is to 
invest colossal amounts of money in their own naval forces. We 
have already sensed this during business contacts. 
  [Gundarov] Do you notice a desire on the part of our 
government to maintain Russia's naval might? 
  [Voronin) ) No. In our country, as is often the case, words 
are at variance with actions. Judging from the state orders 
which shipbuilders now have, our main customer is foreign rather 
than our Defense Ministry: Forty percent of domestic shipyards' 
capacities are starting to work for the West. 
  [Gundarov] In that case, what awaits the industrial complex 
which works for the Russian Navy? 
  [Voronin] We are waiting for the state to settle accounts 
with shipbuilders. I will cite just one figure. The state owes 
the "Sevmash" production association 130 billion rubles. For 
several months we have been promised that this money would be 
paid, but the debt has not yet been cleared. Hence the 
enterprise has no circulating capital and the production chain 
is being destroyed. In short, all this is a string of truisms 
about which a considerable amount has already been said. 
  [Gundarov] Do you have specific proposals as to how to 
maintain production? 
  [Voronin] The matter is complicated by the fact that, on the 
one hand, conversion programs apparently exist but, on the 
other, they are not being implemented because finance for them 
is lacking. Therefore we are not elaborating proposals but 
specific subprograms for every plant. They do not have to 
choose right now. They are getting to work fulfilling any 
orders: Whether they be for peasants, oil or gas industry 
workers, or along ecological lines. 
  [Gundarov] And at the same time shipbuilding technology is 
being destroyed? 
  [Voronin] Yes, from the viewpoint of shipbuilding 
construction we are, of course, losing out. 
  [Gundarov] Maybe this is a consequence of the fact that 
there is no Navy lobby in the government? 
  [Voronin] To some extent I agree with you. There are many 
lobbyists of various persuasions. But as far as the Navy goes I 
do not see its lobbyists. Yuriy Yarov has a better grasp of the 
Navy's problems than others in the government. But 
unfortunately he is engaged in resolving other questions. But I 
do not sense in certain other people who have reached the 
crucible of power any understanding of the tasks facing the 
production complex, which in particular provides for the Navy's 
needs. This occurs because these people have not passed through 
the plant school. The moment has now come when nobody wants to 
hear the exhortations of practical people, and they themselves 
are called antireformists. But practical people would not have 
made the colossal mistakes we are now observing in the 
management of industry. The problem of cadres, I believe, is 
now the most pressing. Incidentally, I am for reforms, but they 
must be carried out in a more evolutionary way. 
  [Gundarov] What would you do first of all if the situation 
in which the Navy found itself depended entirely on you? 
  [Voronin] It is just the same as asking a mechanic at a 
technical servicing center what he would do first of all with a 
broken machine. First he would probably have a look at it. If 
we start at the beginning, I am convinced that industry could 
withstand 5 percent or a maximum of 10 percent conversion. 
Foreign experience demonstrates this. As conversion increases 
the production process becomes unmanageable, because it comes 
into conflict with science and economics. It is therefore hard 
to say what should be done first of all when everything has 
disintegrated. 
  Wars are raging all over the world. The situation in the 
Near East is complex, and it is becoming acute in Asia. The 
brake has been taken off the U.S. Navy. I think I would review 
the shipbuilding program and adopt a more careful attitude to 
reducing it. Obsolete ships, which are not combat-effective in 
a modern war, can be cut. But in fact we are cutting ships 
which have been in service only 15 years instead of 25. 
  Second, whether we like it or not, plants must not be 
allowed 
to fall below the "red" line. Otherwise no edicts or orders 
will save production from collapsing. 
  [Gundarov] Gennadiy Petrovich, in ending our conversation, 
what would you -- the man who is building the Navy -- like to 
wish the Navy's sailors in the new year of 1994? 
  [Voronin] It is hard to find more optimistic people, 
although figuratively speaking they have to "fight" every day: 
When cruising, on combat service, or on alert status. I would 
like to wish that their optimism never deserts them. I am 
convinced that better times are ahead for the Navy, because we 
have a demonstrable trump card enabling us to be a naval power. 
And no political battles can take it away from us.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Gavrilenko under the rubric "The </F>
Society": "Dangerous Depth: Pacific Fleet Divers Sending Out 
SOS"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok-- 
<H5>  They Are Hurting </H5>
  The last time they rescued people was in June of 1983. A 
submarine had had an accident and sunk to a great depth. More 
than 100 men were sealed in at the bottom of the ocean. Deep-sea 
divers came to their rescue. The rescue operation, which lasted 
several days, was successful.... 
  Until the end of the 1980's two deep-sea diving systems 
(GVK) 
operated in the Pacific Fleet. These unique units made it 
possible to find and rescue crews of submarines involved in 
accidents at depths of more than 300 meters. The first was 
installed on the submarine Komsomolets Uzbekistana, the second 
on the search-and-rescue vessel Alagez. 
  For more than two years now, however, both diving units have 
been undergoing put-off repair work, and the fleet does not have 
the money to complete them. The scariest thing is the fact that 
if, God forbid, a submarine should be involved in an accident 
such as the one which occurred in 1983, no one would be able to 
help the crew. 
  According to Capt 1st Rank Aleksandr Peremet, chief of the 
section for search-and-rescue support and combat training, the 
situation has repeatedly been reported to the TOF [Pacific 
Fleet] commander, the commander in chief of the VMF [Navy] and 
even the President of Russia. No specific decisions have yet 
been made on this urgent matter, however. 
  Capt 3rd Rank Sergey Salin, senior diving specialist for the 
Pacific Fleet, told me that his subordinates are presently 
engaged only in minor servicing of ships and vessels in the area 
of the base. And all because the diving equipment of Pacific 
Fleet personnel lags at least 30-40 years behind that of the 
Europeans. It is not just difficult but actually dangerous to 
use the equipment. Two divers have died in the fleet in the past 
year. Three others have suffered serious injuries. 
Osteochrondrosis is an occupational disease of the diver. One 
out of two "conquerors of the deep" suffers from it. 
  There is worse. The latest training aid for divers dates 
back 
to 1962. The seamen learn the specialties of "underwater 
detonation specialist" and "underwater welder" from aids going 
all the way back to 1956. 
  The manning level for seamen-divers in the fleet (albeit 
this 
is of somewhat secondary importance; the personnel problem is 
the same throughout) does not exceed 35 percent. Nor are there 
enough civilian specialists, because their salaries in the Far 
East Shipping Line is greater than that of fleet personnel by a 
factor of 1.5-2. 
  There is one other factor, which clearly needs to be 
considered on the legislative level. As a result of the constant 
psychological and physical stress, the people who dedicate their 
lives to diving rapidly "wear out" and age. The fleet's medical 
specialists believe that the maximum age for deep diving is 40 
years. After the age of 40 deep diving is absolutely 
counterindicated. Lack of any kind of benefits, however, 
prevents the divers from retiring earlier than Moscow's 
trolleybus operators. 
  Unfortunately, this is far from all the problems faced by 
Pacific Fleet personnel at a dangerous depth. The Pacific Fleet 
could find itself in the near future with no one to dive. And 
the deep-sea rescue divers must therefore be rescued themselves.

<F P=106> [Major-General V. Rudik, chief of the Civilian Defense </F>
Workers Directorate, interviewed by Colonel Anatoliy Yurkin 
(res): "Urgent Topic: Civilian Personnel of Russian Federation 
Armed Forces--Wages and Social Protection"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Defense Minister's 
Order No. 130, "On Introducing New Wage Terms for Civilian 
Personnel of Troop Units, Institutions, Military Educational 
Institutions, and Budget-Financed Enterprises and Organizations 
of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense on the Basis of a 
Uniform Wage Scale [UWS]," significantly improves social 
protection for civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces 
and is becoming a tangible incentive. 
  Major-General V. Rudik, chief of the Civilian Personnel 
Labor and Wages Directorate of the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces, tells about the procedure for introducing the new wage 
terms based on the Uniform Wage Scale (UWS) and the tasks 
involved in accomplishing this important work. 
  [Yurkin] The introduction of new wage terms affects the 
vital 
interests of employees of the entire national-economic budget 
sphere and the civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces. 
However, before talking about the innovations, Viktor 
Antonovich, it seems that we should first discuss, if only 
briefly, the background of this issue. Many ask why the 
introduction of the UWS was necessary and whether it is in 
keeping with the Russian Federation Labor Law Code. 
  [Rudik] Let's start from the beginning: The socioeconomic 
situation that obtained at the end of last year caused a sharp 
change in traditional wage policy. A significant wage gap arose 
between the production and nonproduction spheres. 
  After prices were liberalized, members of certain branches 
(miners, air-traffic controllers) used various methods to obtain 
appreciable advantages, causing even greater tension in society. 
The question of social justice and compliance with the 
requirements of Article Two of the Russian Federation Labor Law 
Code arose with special urgency. Let me remind you what that 
article says: "Every worker has the right to equal compensation 
for equal work, without any discrimination and not below the 
legally prescribed minimum amount." This in turn led to Russian 
Federation government Decree No. 785, whose purpose is to 
regulate wage rates for various branches and to establish 
substantiated wage ratios for workers depending on complexity 
and skill levels and based on the use of the UWS. 
  Just what is the UWS? It is a uniform scale of wage rates 
and 
grade-based wages for workers and office employees. It 
encompasses all budget sphere workers and provides for wage 
differentiation among 18 grades. The wage scale for workers has 
eight grades. In contrast to analogous workers in the national 
economy, the Russian Federation government decree sets increases 
in wage rates of up to 50 percent for categories of civilian 
personnel and for various types of work, as well as a schedule 
of additional payments, compensation payments, and wage and 
salary raises linked to the particular features of military 
units' activities. 
  [Yurkin] Who has been given advantages in terms of the 
amounts of wage and salary increases? Won't workers' rights be 
infringed upon? 
  [Rudik] No, they will not. The wage rates (including the 
increases of up to 50 percent) have been increased first and 
foremost for workers, who had no grounds to complain about their 
pay earlier. This applies to toolmakers, a wide range of machine 
tool operators, and tool-setters who work with unique equipment. 
This category also includes loggers, divers, topographers and 
geodesists, district power grid specialists, and several others. 
  The maximum wage increase of 50 percent is being introduced 
for all UWS grade one workers, as well as for certain categories 
of physicians and middle- and junior-level medical personnel. 
Wage rates are being increased by 40 percent for all workers on 
whom UWS grade two is conferred, such as drivers, road and 
railroad repairmen, utility repairmen, and workers who 
specialize in construction repairs. I could continue this list, 
but the point of the changes lies in that the differentiated 
wage increases were also prompted by an adverse personnel 
situation. For example, certain garrisons in the Fear East and 
the Transbaykal region in effect have no workers to operate 
their utility systems. For this reason, the introduction of the 
UWS provides wage increases for workers that are more 
substantial, and in a number of cases higher, than those for 
degree-holding specialists, such as engineers, economists, and 
even directors of structural divisions. 
  [Yurkin] Many readers might immediately ask about the 
procedure that will be used to confer grades on workers. Who 
will do this? 
  [Rudik] That is a rather complex question, but I will give 
an 
intelligible answer to it. First of all, enterprise and 
organization workers whose pay was based on hourly wage rates 
will be subject to the previous procedure for conferring grades 
one through eight, which conform to the UWS wage categories. The 
Russian defense minister's order directs that skill categories 
are to be conferred on workers who did not have them previously. 
For example, guards, office cleaning women, film projectionists, 
and park landscapers. This also applies to boiler operators and 
dry cleaning and laundry workers. Military units also have other 
worker occupations for which a specific wage category is not 
conferred but rather set by the commanding officer. He takes 
into account the difficulty, service norms, and other parameters 
of the job in question. 
  Grades nine and 10 can be set for highly skilled workers 
employed in important and responsible jobs. I should point out 
that this norm should not be viewed as a chance to establish 
wage rates for worker occupations in grades nine and 10, but 
only as a chance to pay them wages based on the rates set for 
these grades. These wages need not necessarily be of a permanent 
character. 
  The introduction of the UWS does not require that workers be 
assigned new wage categories, as a rule. They are simply given 
the new wage in keeping with the grade already conferred on them 
or set for them by the commanding officer, and an entry is made 
to this effect in their labor record booklets. 
  Military unit commanders are also permitted to introduce 
labor organization and wage methods and systems (temporary, 
piece-rate, brigade, etc.) when concluding collective contracts 
within the scope of the confirmed wage fund. 
  [Yurkin] Let's hope, Viktor Antonovich, that the gist of 
your 
explanations will be clear to workers reading this. The 
important thing is that they are going to start earning more 
money by exhibiting diligence and discipline. Will the social 
rights of directors and specialists and of our intelligentsia be 
safeguarded just as thoroughly? 
  [Rudik] I see no reason for concern, since wage procedures 
and terms for that category of civilian personnel of the Russian 
Armed Forces have been set for all budget branches, regardless 
of place of work. For example, economists will have wage scales 
in the range of grades six through 11, chief specialists, 13 
through 17, and office managers, four and five. In view of the 
heightened social responsibility and the creative character of 
the work of employees in public education, higher education, 
public health, and science, their wage rates have been set at 
one to four grades higher than those for general specialists. 
For example, while engineers in various specialties have wage 
rates at grades six through 11, teachers and doctors will have 
wage rates at grades seven through 14 and grades eight through 
15, respectively. 
  For many specialist positions, skill requirements entail 
dual 
grades within the framework of the corresponding category. For 
example, a category-two production engineer comes under grades 
nine and 10. This is due to rather significant differences in 
the level of difficulty, diversity and importance of their 
official duties. Taking this approach to setting grades for 
military unit commanders (based on the decisions of 
certification commissions) makes it possible to effectively 
resolve wage rate issues in specific circumstances. 
  The wage rates for top officials and directors of 
institutions, organizations, and enterprises fall within grades 
nine through 18, as a rule. They are differentiated on the basis 
of complexity of administrative functions and their social 
responsibility. Salary rates for deputy directors and chief 
accountants are set 10 to 20 percent, and for assistant 
directors 30 to 40 percent, below the salary of the 
corresponding director. The amount by which the salary is 
reduced is set at any percentage from the minimum to the maximum 
amount established for the deputy, assistant director, or chief 
accountant. As in the case of specialists, wages for this 
category will be based on the findings of special certification 
procedures. 
  [Yurkin] What determines wage amounts for enterprise, 
institution, and organization directors? 
  [Rudik] The group of the enterprise, institution, or 
organization. Military units and formations, for example, are 
divided into four groups. This division is a forced one. You 
will agree that managing a corps and managing a division are by 
no means one and the same thing. It is hardly fair if a 
1,500-bed hospital pays the same wage as a hospital with just 
200 beds. The criteria for assigning plants, arsenals, bases, 
warehouses, repair shops, print shops, and a number of other 
enterprises and organizations to the various groups are 
performance indices in physical terms and the established number 
of workers. When work-force tables are registered and audits and 
checks are performed, a check is made to see that the director 
has been assigned to the correct wage group. 
  [Yurkin] Will wage terms and, in particular, above-wage 
amounts change with the introduction of the UWS? 
  [Rudik] In contrast to the national economy, the 
introduction 
of the UWS for civilian employees of the Russian Armed Forces 
entails significant changes in this form of wages. 
  In shifting to the new wage terms based on the UWS, military 
unit commanders are authorized, when concluding collective 
contracts and within the scope of their approved wage funds, to 
agree to salary raises, to set additional payments over and 
above the wage rates, and to pay additional pay of a 
compensation character. For the first time, additional pay has 
been introduced for combat alert duty and for working in rural 
areas. 
  The main types of additional pay of a compensation character 
are provided to directors, specialists, and technical 
performance personnel who know foreign languages and use them in 
their daily work and to motor vehicle drivers with skill 
ratings. The defense minister's order takes into account all 
special features of the work of branch employees and categories 
of civilian personnel and establishes various types of salary 
raises and additional pay. 
  In my opinion, the new system for paying percentage-based 
increases for uninterrupted service merits special attention. 
  [Yurkin] Needless to say, we are dealing with an urgent 
problem that concerns a lot of people. Could you spell out what 
the innovations being introduced will basically mean, so that 
readers of our journal who work in military units and at 
Ministry of Defense organizations and enterprises can quickly 
calculate their wages? 
  [Rudik] Let me begin with the most important point: The 
amount of the percentage-based additional pay for uninterrupted 
service has been substantially increased and is now equal to 
that of an officer for years of service. This innovation was 
introduced in order to stabilize cadres and to give civilian 
personnel a greater material incentive to amass uninterrupted 
work time in military units and to increase their wages. The 
following additional pay for uninterrupted service, as a 
percentage of the wage rate for basic occupation, has been 
established: more than one year, five percent; more than two 
years, 10 percent; more than three years, 15 percent; more than 
five years, 20 percent; more than 10 years, 25 percent; more 
than 15 years, 30 percent; and more than 20 years, 40 percent. 
It should now be easy to make the calculations with a pencil. 
  The procedure for calculating length of uninterrupted 
service 
for servicemen who have been discharged into the reserves or 
have retired on account of age, sickness, personnel cutbacks, or 
health limitations has been changed, and rightly so. Their total 
length of uninterrupted service conferring the right to receive 
percentage-based additional pay for such service now includes 
their entire period of military service. True, on one condition: 
That they began working in the military unit within one year of 
the date of discharge from military service, and, with respect 
to employees discharged on account of disability, excluding the 
time of a group one or group two disability. This period used to 
be six months. 
  The question of including military service in the Armed 
Forces of the states that used to be former Soviet union 
republics has also been solved in a positive fashion, provided 
that the person began working in the military unit within one 
year of the date on which he was discharged into the reserves or 
retired on those same grounds. Given current migration 
processes, this measure will undoubtedly help many people make 
important decisions about their future, relying on the help of 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense. 
  [Yurkin] The social orientation of many Russian Federation 
laws relating to our Armed Forces is clear. Does the 
introduction of the UWS give broader rights to unit commanders 
in providing incentives for conscientious service? 
  [Rudik] The rights of commanders are undoubtedly broadened. 
With the consent of elective trade union agencies, each year 
military unit commanders approve a material incentive and 
material assistance fund in an amount of up to six monthly wage 
funds (based on a one-year period). How will this money be used? 
First and foremost, to pay bonuses for basic performance on a 
monthly and quarterly basis and to make additional incentive 
payments. For example, for completing especially important, 
urgent tasks and to reward employees for annual performance 
results--the so-called 13th paycheck. 
  The following provision is also new: Monies in this fund may 
be used to reimburse workers for meals and the cost of commuting 
on urban public transport and to make other payments of a social 
character stipulated in a collective contract. The latter is the 
legal foundation regulating all material incentive matters. 
Bonuses, additional pay, rewards, and material assistance paid 
to an individual employee are not limited by any maximum 
ceilings; however, total payments to all workers in the course 
of one year must not exceed six monthly wage funds (based on a 
one-year period). Money saved from monthly wage funds may not be 
used for these purposes. 
  [Yurkin] Viktor Antonovich, let me make a proposal: Let's 
look at incentive factors on a somewhat different plane. You 
will agree that it's one thing to live and work in Russia's 
central regions, and quite another in Siberia and the Far North. 
Are any compensation measures provided for Northerners, 
Siberians, Far Easterners, and people in the Transbaykal region? 
  [Rudik] I can assure you that the approach to setting 
regional coefficients, the subject of your question, has been 
fundamentally changed. Everyone was fed up with the 
discrepancies that existed earlier. For example, a 1.30 
coefficient was set for military units in Nizhneilimskiy and 
Bratsk Rayons, Irkutsk Province, but a 1.40 coefficient for 
loggers. This sort of social discrimination against civilian 
personnel of the Russian Armed Forces was also to be observed in 
Okhotsk District, Khabarovsk Kray. These discrepancies have now 
been eliminated. 
  The Ministry of Defense has been authorized to apply 
regional 
coefficients to the wages of civilian personnel within the scope 
of the coefficients set for a corresponding region, including 
those set by local agencies. For this reason, Order No. 130 of 
the Russian Federation defense minister establishes uniform 
regional coefficients for civilian personnel of military units, 
institutions, enterprises, and organizations in the 
corresponding regions. 
  The introduction of the UWS entails a shift to the 
interbranch wage organization principle. This means that in 
fields of Defense Ministry activity, equal pay for equal work is 
being introduced for employees in equivalent occupations. At the 
same time, special features of the work of employees in various 
branches are taken into account in setting wage terms. This is 
reflected in defense minister Order No. 130 that I mentioned. 
  [Yurkin] If we are going to discuss special wage 
arrangements, I suggest that we start with military educational 
institutions. 
  [Rudik] This section of the order deals with wage terms not 
only for higher educational establishment employees, but also 
for employees of general-education institutions, such as 
schools, kindergartens, and extracurricular and military 
educational establishments. 
  For professor and instructor positions, skill requirements 
call for experience in research, research-and-teaching, or 
practical work, which must be reflected in the employee's labor 
record booklet. 
  The procedure for paying for teaching work over and above 
established workload norms (including when an employee is 
substituting for an instructor who is temporarily absent) has 
been changed. An employee may hold a second job at up to 50 
percent time, in either his own or another department, it makes 
no difference. On the whole, the innovations will result in a 
increase 3-4 times for the salaries for educators in comparison 
with November 1992, and increase of 3.5-5 times for educational 
institution directors. 
  We also have another category of civilian employees whose 
wages have prompted many questions. It is medical and pharmacy 
employees. There will be no special certifications in 
introducing the new wage terms. Under the wage scale system, 
their pay grades will be based on the position they hold, the 
skill category conferred on them, whether they hold any academic 
ranks or honorary titles, and their place of work. 
  Physician specialists at rest and relaxation facilities, 
preventive-care facilities, boarding houses, tourist centers, 
sports schools and facilities, general-education schools, and 
preschool and extracurricular institutions will be assigned to 
UWS wage grade nine, regardless of their skill categories. 
  Medical and pharmacy employees who manage their departments 
and are candidates of sciences; physicians who serve as chairmen 
of military physician commissions and medical flight 
commissions; directors of military medical institutions who have 
a skill category; and physicians who have the honorary title 
"Meritorious Physician" are to be assigned a pay grade that is 
one grade higher than that of persons who do not have these 
distinctions. I repeat: only one grade higher, not two grades, 
one for being a manager and one for the honorary title. 
  [Yurkin] Are there no exceptions? 
  [Rudik] The rule is this: People who are entitled to 
increase 
their pay grades by one or two grades on the basis of several 
factors may take one pay grade increase based on the most 
compelling grounds. And now as regards exceptions: The UWS pay 
grades may be raised by two grades for physicians and for 
certified pharmacists who manage their military medical 
institutions and who have the highest skill rating, and for 
doctors of science and physicians who hold the honorary title 
"People's Physician." 
  I should also call attention to the following features: 
Military hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as out-patient 
polyclinics that include diagnostic centers, have been raised to 
the next highest grade with respect to wages for their 
directors. In addition, in contrast to the previous procedure, 
salaries for civilian personnel who work in hazardous and 
especially difficult conditions are being raised not only for 
employees of military medical institutions, but also for 
employees who are enlisted to provide consultation, medical 
care, and other services. The salary increases for these 
employees are based on the actual amount of time they work under 
the aforementioned conditions. 
  [Yurkin] How will wages for cultural workers change? In the 
library, Margarita Petrovna complained to me that she had worked 
her entire life for 120 rubles. 
  [Rudik] Now the situation has changed. The salary paid to a 
library director before the introduction of the UWS has been 
increased by 293 percent. For a librarian without a skill 
rating, the salary has been increased by 182 percent. But that's 
not all: Directors of cultural organizations, institutions, and 
enterprises are given the right, in concluding collective 
contracts, to include commitments--over and above those 
stipulated in the overall wage terms--to raise salaries for arts 
workers who hold the honorary titles "People's Artist" and 
"Meritorious Artist." Rank and file workers have not been 
overlooked either. For example, salaries may be increased for 
cinema mechanics, library workers, and other specialists at 
cultural-education institutions in rural areas. 
  [Yurkin] Significant changes have been made in the wage 
system for sailors, hydrographers, divers, and command personnel 
on Russian Navy support ships. Will this be an incentive in 
their work? 
  [Rudik] I think it will. The international classification of 
command personnel positions was used in devising the skill 
requirements. For example, captain is followed by the position 
of senior (chief) mechanic, and the position of second mechanic 
is equivalent in pay to the position of senior captain's 
assistant. This was done not by lowering the pay grades for 
captains' assistants, but by raising the pay grades for the 
mechanics. 
  The positions of other support ship crew members have been 
standardized. 
  Substantial changes have been made in wages for divers. 
Instead of three specialization groups, divers have been 
assigned pay grades four through eight, with grade eight 
reserved solely for Defense Ministry divers. Additional pay for 
skill ratings have been maintained for them. For the first time, 
the question of wages for nonstaff divers on sea (roadstead) 
ships for time spent working underwater has been resolved. 
  [Yurkin] There is one other category of Russian Armed Forces 
civilian personnel that we have not touched on--employees of 
district, fleet, and army staffs. Please explain how they will 
be paid. 
  [Rudik] The UWS wage principles do not extend to state 
administrative agencies. Wage terms for these employees will be 
set forth in the Russian Federation Law "On State Service." In 
the meantime, the decree of the Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet and Government "On Regulating Wages for Employees of 
Representative and Executive Government Agencies" is in effect, 
together with the Russian defense minister's Order No. 129 of 
March 8 of this year. 
  The provisions of defense minister Order No. 130 apply fully 
to the civilian employees of military administrative agencies as 
concerns the procedure for calculating and confirming wage 
funds, providing percentage-based additional pay for 
uninterrupted service and regional coefficients, and providing 
material incentives to such employees; up to six monthly wage 
funds (based on a one-year period) may be used for these 
purposes. 
  Now that I have described the special features of wages for 
various categories of civilian personnel of the Russian Armed 
Forces, I consider it necessary to call attention to the 
certification of directors, specialists, and technical execution 
personnel for the purpose of making sure that the employee is 
qualified for the position he holds and determining his wage 
grade in accordance with the UWS. This certification is quite 
different from previous ones and is designed to ensure effective 
measures to improve these employees' material situations and to 
reinforce their wages' incentive role, based on social justice 
principles. 
  I want to emphasize that certification will be required for 
all directors, specialists, and technical execution personnel 
(including those working on a part-time basis) of military 
units, institutions, military educational establishments, 
enterprises, and organizations, with the exception of medical 
and pharmacy employees. For them, the wage grades will be set on 
the basis of the previous (1991) certification's results. The 
job of introducing UWS wages will be overseen by the unit 
commander. At the commander's discretion, the mostly highly 
qualified employees of financial agencies, labor agencies, and 
personnel departments, economists, and other specialists may be 
enlisted in it. 
  In view of the special characteristics of this time and 
constantly rising inflation, which is aggravating social tension 
in certain labor collectives, we are pinning special hopes on 
smooth and efficient work by commanders and specialists of 
financial agencies and labor and wage agencies who are best 
qualified to introduce the new UWS wage terms. It is our common 
duty to do everything in our power to ensure that the civilian 
personnel of the Russian Armed Forces receive their newly 
recalculated wages in the shortest possible time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel-Geneal Boris Yevgenyevich Pyankov, </F>
commander of coalition peacekeeping forces, by Yuriy Kushko, 
Dushanbe; date of interview not given: "Blue Helmets Also Go 
With Kyrgyz Boots"] 
  [Text] Were it not for the presence of Coalition 
Peacekeeping Forces of the CIS in Tajikistan, local groupings 
might have already yielded to the temptation of taking up arms. 
The fact that the latter are still observing neutrality and are 
restraining themselves from active operations on a large scale 
is, in the opinion of Colonel-General B. Pyankov, the commander 
of Coalition Peacekeeping Forces in this hot spot, one of the 
chief results of the three months' stay of troops under his 
command on Tajik soil. 
  [Kushko] Boris Yevgenyevich, what made formation of the 
Coalition Peacekeeping Forces (KMS) necessary? 
  [Pyankov] To answer this question I need to first carefully 
explain the situation in which Tajikistan found itself with the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union. Having divided political 
power, the army and the plants with ease, the former Soviet 
republics were unable to divide up their joint security just as 
easily. This was chiefly true of Tajikistan, where internal 
conflicts transformed into civil war, and threatened assumption 
of a regional nature and spread to the borders of Russia itself. 
External aggression also promoted development of the conflict. 
  All of this required CIS countries to take adequate steps to 
provide assistance to our neighbor in misfortune. A decision to 
establish coalition peacekeeping forces consisting of armed 
forces from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and 
Uzbekistan was made in September 1993 at a meeting of the 
leaders of the Commonwealth in Moscow. The Treaty on Collective 
Security signed a year and a half ago in Tashkent by six CIS 
states was the basis for the decision. 
  Ideally, United Nations "blue helmets" should have taken on 
the role of peacekeepers, but today the potential of this 
organization is behind its growing peacekeeping responsibilities. 
  [Kushko] Sending peacekeeping forces into Tajikistan 
generated a number of apprehensions. The Russians wonder if 
their country is going to be drawn into a new Afghan history. 
Citizens of other countries wonder if Russia is continuing to 
demonstrate its imperial ambitions. 
  [Pyankov] We have a clear position in the Tajik conflict--we 
are not interfering in any political scrapes, which differs 
favorably from the position of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, 
where support was rendered to one of the dueling sides. 
  Our main objective is to provide assistance in protecting 
and 
defending the borders. That's precisely where over 20 percent of 
the personnel of the peacekeeping forces are. 
  Our other functions include analyzing the military and 
political situation in the region, protecting humanitarian aid 
columns, and participating in the negotiation process with the 
goal of stabilizing the situation. But in no way are we 
providing any military assistance to local groupings. 
  As far as assertions of Russia's so-called imperial 
ambitions 
are concerned, such a statement of the question is wrong. The 
fact that I am a citizen of Russia doesn't mean my unconditional 
subordination only to Russian leadership. I bear equal 
responsibility before the heads of state and defense ministers 
of five countries. 
  At the same time Russia doubtlessly has its own interests 
here as well. It cannot but be troubled by the position of the 
Russian-speaking population. Around 200,000 Russian-speaking 
citizens still live in Tajikistan. As we know, in May of last 
year one of the leaders of the opposition already attempted to 
declare them to be hostages. 
  [Kushko] What might the effect be of giving the Coalition 
Peacekeeping Forces the status of "blue helmets" of the United 
Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe? 
  [Pyankov] It seems to me that implementing such a proposal 
would encourage the participants of the Tajik conflict to begin 
negotiations. Moreover it would mean international support to 
our actions. In this case we have no opposition at all to 
international inspections or to participation of foreign 
military contingents in our actions in Tajikistan. Unfortunately 
our proposal regarding this matter was not supported at a 
meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
  [Kushko] To what extent is reliance being placed on weapons 
in the actions of the peacekeeping forces, and to what extent on 
political methods? 
  [Pyankov] Actions of the Tajik opposition in preparing for 
new combat operations are evoking countermeasures from our side. 
We are reinforcing the borders, we are undergoing planned combat 
training, and we are undertaking various sorts of preventive 
actions. The KMS have up to 25,000 personnel, up to 2,000 tanks, 
350 infantry fighting vehicles, 350 artillery guns, and aviation 
and helicopters. These forces are capable to opposing any enemy. 
But we are not in any way placing our reliance solely on methods 
of force. 
  [Kushko] To what extent are countries that signed the 
agreement on the KMS fulfilling their obligations? 
  [Pyankov] Only Tajikistan and Russia have fulfilled their 
obligations completely regarding allocation of the needed 
quantity of men and equipment. Russia is having to carry the 
main burden--up to 50 percent of all of the expenses. Russia 
placed the 201st Motorized Rifle Division at the disposal of the 
KMS as its "initial membership dues." 
  A separate motorized-rifle battalion was allocated from 
Uzbek 
armed forces. Operational use of one of the subunits of the 
Kyrgyz contingent is difficult because it is based on its own 
territory. The Kazakh contingent still hasn't arrived. Nor have 
promised resources for the maintenance of the joint command of 
the KMS arrived from Kazakhstan. However, my hope is that the 
leadership of Kazakhstan will fulfill adopted obligations in the 
immediate future. 
  [Kushko] Boris Yevgenyevich, how do you think the situation 
will develop in Tajikistan in the immediate and remote future? 
  [Pyankov] The situation remains complex, despite the 
apparent 
lull. There are three main forces capable of destabilizing it. 
  First, the government in exile, operating from the Afghan 
city of Talukan [transliteration]. It is openly preparing armed 
detachments to fight the present leadership of Tajikistan. The 
Talukan exiles, who have not received recognition from a single 
state or support from their own people, may undertake harsh 
steps. 
  The second force is the democratic opposition, which is 
presently working underground in Tajikistan. It has the support 
of the inhabitants of a number of regions, and it has contacts 
with the Tajik opposition in Moscow. If the detachments of the 
former People's Front that do not have a clear political 
orientation go over to its side, its importance will increase 
significantly. 
  I consider the armed detachments in the Pamirs and the 
several large detachments operating in the mountains in the 
vicinity of Garm to be the third force. 
  All of them may become active in spring in their struggle 
for 
power, which can seriously worsen the situation. 
  A more favorable scenario for the development of events is 
also fully possible. Assuming presence of goodwill and a 
readiness of dialogue among all participants of the Tajik 
conflict, the situation may stabilize to such an extent here by 
the end of 1994 that we would be able to begin reducing the KMS 
contingent.

operational rear services and transport of the CIS Combined 
Armed Forces Staff: "Army and Navy Rear Services: Support to 
Collective Forces"] 
  [Text] The political and economic processes now occurring 
in regions of the former USSR are resulting in destabilization 
in some places, causing crisis situations, and sometimes 
provoking adjacent countries to intervene in the affairs of 
significantly weakened and disunited republics. In this 
situation, the governments and parliaments of a number of CIS 
countries are giving serious thought to their national security 
and seeking to ensure it, among other ways, in the form of 
collective security, through integration in defense issues 
within the commonwealth framework. 
  The member states of the Collective Security Treaty of May 
15, 1992--Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian 
Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan--are cooperating closest 
of all in the defense sphere. Among other things, the treaty 
calls for coordinating the member states' activities in basic 
areas of the mobilizational readiness of their armed forces and 
economic structures and for drawing up recommendations on key 
aspects of military-technical policy and on equipping the member 
states' armed forces with weapons and military hardware. 
  An agreement entitled "On Military Observer Groups and 
Collective Peacekeeping Forces in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States" was signed earlier, in March 1992. Under 
this agreement, collective peacekeeping (also known as 
peacemaking) troops were designated from virtually all the CIS 
states. Depending on the capabilities and interests of each 
specific country, these forces take the form of a battalion, 
regiment, or division. In addition to combat units and subunits, 
the military observers group and collective peacekeeping forces 
can include command personnel, administrative services, an 
expert group, a military police group, and logistical and 
technical support subunits (units). 
  The basic approaches to the organization of rear service 
support for the collective forces are still being worked out on 
the basis of the experience of UN multinational peacekeeping 
forces and command and staff games and exercises. 
  The legal basis for rear services support to the 
peacekeeping 
forces is the protocol "On the Structure of Military Observer 
Groups and Collective Peacekeeping Forces in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States and Their Manning and Logical, Technical, and 
Financial Support." For example, it states that logistical and 
transport support for observers, units, and subunits is to be 
provided by the state that allocates the manpower and equipment 
or, alternatively, by other Commonwealth member states. This 
option for providing support was adopted as the basis at an 
operational assembly of the Main Command of the CIS Combined 
Armed Forces, as well as in the course of a command and staff 
war game that dealt with the training and use of peacekeeping 
contingents. 
  The first phase of the command and staff game, which was 
held 
against the backdrop of the situation that has arisen in the 
Central Asian region by decision of the chiefs of states (the 
decision was confirmed by their parliaments), called for the 
creation of an observers group and collective peacekeeping 
forces from units and subunits of five Commonwealth countries. 
The need to clarify fundamental issues relating to logistical, 
transport, and other types of support in the peacekeeping 
operation mandate became apparent even then. This also applies 
to support to observer groups that, as a rule, will be sent far 
in advance of peacekeeping forces and operate in observation 
zones autonomously, in groups of five to 10 men. Unless it is 
determined in advance how they will be supplied, disruptions and 
misunderstandings are inevitable. 
  In modeling the observers' actions, we relied on the 
experience of the UN, in which the observation areas and objects 
are determined first, and then the territory is divided into 
command and staff zones of responsibility for organizing the 
work of these groups and ensuring that they receive 
comprehensive support. A mobile transport subunit with 
communications equipment is set up in each zone. It is 
indicative that a number of the inspectors have life support 
sets containing all essential supplies, from binoculars and 
bullet-proof vests to food products and personal hygiene items. 
  In speaking about the specific mechanism used to support the 
observer groups, it is quite clear that much will depend on the 
situation. For example, the observer group that operated in 
Tajikistan was based with units of the 201st Division, and no 
special supply problems arose. But not everything went smoothly. 
For example, the border troops command refused to supply a 
helicopter to evacuate 12 observers from Kurgan-Tyube when 
combat operations were under way in the city. Colonel I. Ozerov, 
chief of an operational rear services and transport group of the 
CIS Combined Armed Forces Staff, was then tasked with evacuating 
the observers to Dushanbe. Breaking through to Kurgan-Tyube and 
back while under fire in two armored personnel transports 
provided by the 201st Division, the officer accomplished his 
mission, for which he was decorated with the Order of Personal 
Bravery. The conclusion was drawn that if observers are 
operating separately in disparate areas, their main transport 
equipment must be armored, and their equipment stocks must 
guarantee that the groups are mobile and can operate 
autonomously. 
  It was thus proposed at the command and staff war game that 
there should be one all-terrain vehicle, such as a command and 
staff vehicle, for every 10 observers, and that it should be 
equipped with work and rest areas and a life-support module 
allowing at least 10 days' functioning. 
  It was proposed that the equipment and supplies be 
air-dropped together with the personnel using the manpower and 
assets of the countries providing the military observers. 
  The example of providing rear service support to the 
multinational forces in the Persian Gulf region is indicative. 
Their success was to a considerable extent predetermined by the 
prompt creation of logistical and technical support facilities. 
The American command had 13 major arms and ammunition 
stockpiles, up to 10 fuel and lubricant depots, and 17 supply 
ships carrying aircraft fuel, diesel fuel, food, and other 
supplies in the region. All told, there were enough reserves to 
supply 180,000 men for 30 days. Consequently, in preparing the 
CIS collective forces for operations, it would obviously be a 
good idea to establish support facilities for them in advance. 
In general, this task can be successfully accomplished only on 
the basis of an analytical forecast of potential areas of 
tension, a study of their possibilities from a rear service 
standpoint, a determination of the manpower and equipment to be 
used in the operations, and a procedure for augmenting them. 
  In view of the peacekeeping forces' coalitional character 
and 
the fact that it is not always possible to envision their exact 
makeup, we considered during the command and staff war game the 
option of creating modular rear service supply sets. It was 
proposed that the composition of rear services and their 
functional strength be based on the makeup of the peacekeeping 
forces: command structures and a regiment rear services supply 
set for every three to four battalions, command structures and a 
division rear service supply set for every three to four 
regiments, and so on. Only this approach would seem to ensure 
the possibility of maneuver of rear services personnel and 
equipment and of organizing reliable rear services support in 
any situation. 
  An example of such organization is provided once again by 
the 
operations of the multinational forces in the Persian Gulf. The 
number of rear service units and subunits in the first command 
varied in relation to the grouping of forces and the character 
of combat operations. This was facilitated by a bloc, or 
nonattached, structure of the main rear service units. For 
example, a fuel and lubricants supply battalion could have from 
one to two supply companies and from two to four fuel and 
lubricant transport companies. The same applies to other rear 
service subunits. 
  The command and staff war game also reviewed the option of 
using local economic capabilities to support peacekeeping 
forces. Specifically, it was planned to attach observers, for 
all types of supplies to units and subunits already in the 
observation zone. Furthermore, if, for example, there is a 
petroleum products depot with required types of fuel and 
lubricants in the zone of responsibility, efforts must be made 
to use that depot to augment stocks on site; the same applies to 
buying fresh vegetables and fruits, obtaining fuel and water, 
and carrying out sanitation-hygienic, antiepidemic, and other 
measures. 
  In a number of cases, it is impossible for peacekeeping 
units 
to deal with such matters as restoring facilities along 
communication lines activated for their transport support. It 
must be pointed out that support can hardly come solely from the 
states providing the peacekeeping forces or solely from the use 
of local resources. Support is most likely to be of a mixed 
character. In any case, the use of local capabilities is always 
desirable. 
  An indispensable condition for the timely and uninterrupted 
support to peacekeeping forces is clear-cut command. For this 
reason, it was deemed advisable at the command and staff war 
game to form a combined staff for the military observers group 
and the CIS collective peacekeeping forces under the Main 
Command of the CIS Combined Armed Forces. This staff would 
operate on a permanent basis and include a functional 
subdivision to manage rear services and transport supply. At the 
same time, it is important to have close cooperation between the 
rear service command structures and combined-arms staffs. A veil 
of excessive secrecy between them will be detrimental. This was 
the case in the Transcaucasus a few years ago, when an 
operational rear services group was not told which airfields 
would be used to bring in airborne assault units and how many 
units would be coming. The result was fuel shortages for the 
military transport planes. 
  According to normatives, the basic peacekeeping force 
unit--the reinforced battalion--is to have supplies for three to 
five days. But to ensure autonomous operation, it realistically 
has to have food and fuel reserves for at least 30 days. At the 
same time, the battalion has no agencies that can take delivery, 
properly store, stockpile, and distribute equipment and 
supplies. The conclusion is clear: A peacekeeping unit or 
subunit operating autonomously must be reinforced from a rear 
services standpoint and be equipped with compact equipment for 
life in the field, for storing large reserves of equipment and 
supplies, and for obtaining, storing and disinfecting water. 
Calculations made at the command and staff war game show that 
the following supplies must be on hand in amounts over and above 
the prescribed levels: 

  -  at the regiment level, a mobile field bakery, MMP-2 
(MPP-6) mechanized compact laundry units, a PKS-2m mobile field 
kitchen and mess hall, an AVTS-1.7 vehicle-mounted water tank, 
200 bullet-proof vests, tanks for extra fuel supplies (nearly 
600 metric tons), one camp tent for every 10 men, one officer 
camp tent for every two to three men, staff tents, and 
standardized tents for housing staffs, storing weapons, 
ammunition, food, and other equipment, and four bundles of 
canvas; 
  -  at the battalion level, one AVTS-1.7, one PKHB-0.4, tanks in 
an 
MSB [motorized rifle battalion] for 60 metric tons of fuel, for 
1.8 gasoline refuelings, and for 1.4 diesel fuel refuelings (in 
a PDB, tanks for 50 metric tons of fuel, two gasoline 
refuelings, and two diesel fuel refuelings), and tents in the 
same ratio specified for the regiment level. 

    The units must also have three MK-30 and KP-20 field 
kitchens 
per battalion to support an outpost, posts, and patrols. 
  A peacekeeping operation can last a long time. And by the 
end 
of the first month, it will likely be necessary to have a 
temporary rear service group to take delivery of equipment and 
supplies from the republics' national commands and to distribute 
them to the peacekeeping forces. When operations are very 
prolonged, and also when forces are introduced to prevent local 
conflicts on external borders (based on the experience of the 
command and staff war game), it will be necessary to create up a 
forward support facility for the collective forces. 
  It must be pointed out that supporting mixed collective 
forces is in itself a difficult task. And as some Commonwealth 
states introduce their own currencies, take steps to equip their 
forces with Western arms and equipment, set their own supply 
norms, and introduce their own uniforms, this task will become 
more and more difficult. When the Warsaw Pact countries' joint 
armed forces existed, a system of bases and stockpiles of 
equipment and supplies was created, and effective efforts were 
made to establish a common transport network and system for 
maintaining it. Protocols and agreements were rigorously 
observed. But the question of supporting coalitional groupings, 
especially in the course of counterstrikes and counteroffensives 
away from supply bases, has never been fully resolved. The same 
applies to standardizing rear services manpower and equipment. 
Therefore, in our view, in order to avoid or at least alleviate 
the problem of using collective peacekeeping forces in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, the CIS states' armed forces 
must follow common rear service support principles and preserve 
a common rear service support system, common rear service 
organization and common operational tactics. Preserving the most 
important integrative components of the rear service system of 
the former Soviet armed forces is also invaluable--above all a 
common defense communications network and maintenance elements 
and regional rear service preparations. It is important to take 
common approaches to the creation, stockpiling, and siting of 
logistical supplies for the Combined Armed Forces and armed 
forces of the Commonwealth states and to the operation of 
mobilizational agencies to deploy rear service troops and 
installations. 
  Finally, the mobilizational and operational plans of the 
former Soviet armed forces were formulated with due regard for 
the actual correlation of forces and equipment and capabilities 
for utilizing them. Corresponding logistical, technical, and 
transport facilities were created. In destroying it, the 
Commonwealth states are dooming themselves to a struggle for 
survival in which each state is on its own, and this poses 
problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. of Military Sciences Professor Ivan Vorobyev </F>
under "Information To Ponder" rubric: "`Gaps' in Theory, or 
What We Lack in Order To Carry Out Peacemaking Actions"] 
  [Text] Russia is the only state on the territory of the 
former USSR which today is actually voluntarily carrying out the 
peacemaking functions which it has taken on. More than 16,000 
Russian servicemen have now been mobilized to fulfill tasks in 
various parts of the former Union. The problem of "peacemaking" 
has acquired such topicality for our Army that this circumstance 
was reflected in the "Main Provisions of Military Doctrine of 
the Russian Federation." As is known, the document defines the 
main internal sources of military threats, to counteract which 
the Armed Forces may be used. 
  Such actions are by no means a novelty for the world 
community. Considerable experience of carrying them out has been 
accumulated. Thus, since the adoption of the UN Charter (1975), 
when their legal status was defined, 26 peacemaking operations 
have been carried out under UN auspices, of which 13 have been 
completed to date and the rest are continuing. At the same time 
this problem has not yet been worked out in our military theory 
-- which is fraught with unjustified combat losses when carrying 
out actions of this kind. I believe that it now appears 
possible, on the basis of the accumulated experience, to draw 
certain theoretical and practical conclusions in respect of the 
conditions, forms, and means of preparing for and conducting 
peacemaking operations and the participation of armed forces in 
them. All the more so because great attention is being devoted 
to this question in a number of states -- for example, in the 
United States, the FRG, France, and Britain. Thus, U.S. 
politicians believe that under conditions of increasing 
instability in various parts of the world there will be an 
increasing likelihood of military interference in events which 
do not attain the scale of a war. This is also confirmed by the 
main provisions of the new U.S. military doctrine, which is 
known unofficially as the "Clinton doctrine." Special 
regulations on the conduct of peacemaking operations are being 
drawn up in accordance with this doctrine. 
  In principle, a peacemaking action is aimed at settling a 
conflict which arises and normalizing the situation by peaceful, 
diplomatic means, without bloodshed. In practice, however, this 
is not always achieved. While in the buffer zone, the "blue 
helmets," who are called upon to separate the warring sides and 
to monitor observance of a truce, frequently find themselves as 
kind of hostages when the situation becomes exacerbated, as is 
happening in Yugoslavia, for example -- they fall between two 
fires. In this instance the UN Charter (Article 42) does not 
rule out the use of strong-arm methods to restore peace. 
  But in our case, as already stated, a great deal in this 
matter has not yet been settled. It is, above all, necessary to 
settle legal questions within the CIS relating to the conduct of 
peacemaking actions and to elaborate and realize in practice the 
main principles for building and utilizing both Russian and 
interstate, coalition peacemaking forces of the CIS. To this it 
should be added that the problem of carrying out peacemaking 
operations concerns not only the specialized peacemaking forces 
but also other troops which under certain conditions can also be 
drawn into the maelstrom of crisis events. 
  Let us recall tragic events in the USSR, particularly in 
Tbilisi (1989), Vilnius (1990), Baku (1990).... The sending in 
of troops to resolve the crisis that had arisen not only did not 
yield the desired result, since it had no legal basis, but also 
elicited an extremely negative reaction in society and helped to 
fuel anti-army hysteria. That is, practice has shown that troop 
forces, just like law enforcement organs, are not in themselves 
capable of eliminating a crisis situation caused by political, 
economic, social, ethnic, and other contradictions. They are 
only capable of creating the necessary preconditions for 
normalizing the situation. 
  Which principles, by which we should be guided in the use of 
peacemaking (troop) forces to resolve a conflict situation, have 
been formulated to date? 
  The principle of legality should be numbered among 
them above all. This principle requires the personnel of the 
peacemaking forces to know well and carry out most stringently 
the legal norms and legislative acts laid down for operations in 
an emergency situation and to infringe in no way the freedom of 
the individual or human rights. This predetermines the 
conditions and limits of the use of physical force, special 
means, weapons, and combat hardware to maintain public order. 
  Complying with the principle of 
preventive-precautionary actions means envisaging measures 
well in advance and taking them in time so as to prevent the 
development of a conflict situation, while at the same time 
managing, as far as possible, without the use of strong-arm 
methods and relying on the mechanism of talks. But moderation 
[mera] is needed here -- tolerance and indecision must not be 
manifested when the situation starts to get out of control and 
illegal forces go over to armed violence. 
  The success of a peacemaking action further depends on the 
thoroughness of its preparation. The Americans 
believe, for example, that it takes at least four to six weeks 
of intensive exercises and individual drill and training 
sessions to prepare subunits of the peacemaking force. 
  The important principles also include the principle of 
efficient cooperation between the peacemaking forces 
and the local administration, law enforcement organs, and 
internal troops of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. 
  Thus, the nature of the peacemaking forces' operations in a 
conflict zone depends on many circumstances. In some cases they 
assist the local administrative and law enforcement organs and 
MVD internal troops to ensure the maintenance of public order 
and public security. In others they bear the brunt of 
normalizing the situation in a region in the grip of combat 
operations. 
  In the event of the exacerbation of a conflict, when it 
assumes the form of an armed confrontation, the peacemaking 
forces must take control of the development of events so as to 
stop insurgent actions in time, to prevent the seizure of 
weapons by gunmen, and to avert acts of terrorism, shooting, and 
attacks on state establishments, the population, military camps, 
military columns, railroad trains, etc. The package of measures 
to be implemented in this case can conventionally be divided 
into three types: reconnaissance actions to expose illegal 
groupings, gunmen, and bandit formations; precautionary measures 
taken for the purpose of patrolling, cordoning off, and 
monitoring road traffic; strong-arm measures conducted to search 
for and disarm gunmen and bandit formations and, in case of 
resistance, to render them harmless. 
  At the same time it should be emphasized once again that a 
peacemaking action which takes the form of combat operations 
against illegal armed formations can only be justified if there 
is no alternative to it. 
  It is understandable that in this case the actions of the 
peacemaking forces are highly specific. What is needed here is 
a special tactic, which we also have not yet elaborated. 
Although it is possible to make certain recommendations on this 
score on the basis of an analysis of the existing experience 
accumulated in Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan, Abkhazia, and the 
Dniester region. 
  So, on arriving in a conflict zone, it is important for the 
commander of the peacemaking forces to establish contact 
primarily with the local administration, the law enforcement 
organs, and the temporary operations group of the Internal 
Affairs Administration in order quickly to gather data on the 
operational situation, analyze them, and adopt a decision on 
implementing the necessary measures for the peacemaking forces' 
participation in ensuring the legal regime of the state of 
emergency. In a number of instances it will at once be 
necessary to create special reconnaissance and search groups for 
helicopter patrols of the terrain and monitoring of traffic on 
roads and in population centers. By analyzing the operational 
situation which has taken shape in the zone of responsibility, 
it is necessary to make a forecast: how the crisis situation 
might develop further, what new hotbeds of tension might arise, 
what is the composition of bandit groups, their armament, their 
base regions, their operating tactics, and their control and 
support system, what are the sources of reinforcement and 
supply, what is the local population's attitude toward them. 
  In particular, it is known from experience that 
uncoordinated 
detachments of 100-160 gunmen armed with assault rifles and 
pistols are created in a conflict zone at first. Centralized 
leadership of the gunmen's actions is organized subsequently, 
individual detachments unite into larger formations, base 
regions, training centers, and dumps are created, weapons are 
accumulated, including heavy weapons, and a system of 
observation and identification is established over an extensive 
territory. Gunmen usually employ the tactics of partisan 
operations and periodically carry out night sallies and surprise 
raids, chiefly against weapons dumps and military camps. The 
chief purpose of their actions is to acquire weapons, means of 
transport, and ammunition. 
  Depending on the nature of the gunmen's actions and their 
equipment and training, the decision is made to carry out a 
special operation for the purpose of rendering them harmless. 
One of the most widespread tactical methods used for this 
purpose is the search. It is carried out in those cases where 
the gunmen's exact base has not been established and only the 
approximate area of their operations is known. Therefore ground 
and air (helicopter) reconnaissance is primarily organized. 
Special groups are created for a search, and their actions are 
backed up chiefly by combat helicopters. The pace of a search 
on a moderately rough semiopen terrain is of the order of 1-1.5 
km per hour. 
  As the gunmen's location is established, the decision to 
comb 
the terrain might be adopted for the purpose of rendering them 
harmless. Combing can be unilateral and bilateral (from 
opposite directions). The starting point and the finishing 
point (meeting point) on a terrain offering concealment are set 
for subunits, and, in addition, the direction of movement is 
defined. When combing, subunits at first advance in a column 
and are then deployed in a chain, with intervals of 12-15 meters 
between servicemen on semiopen terrain. It is particularly 
important to provide for security measures and to establish 
clear mutual identification signals. If, when a detachment of 
gunmen is detected, it offers active resistance and there prove 
to be inadequate forces and means for an immediate rout, then it 
is expedient to organize blocking by means of erecting obstacles 
so as to neutralize its actions. Given a favorable situation, 
the bandit grouping is surrounded and subsequently broken up and 
routed. 
  The most acceptable tactic for rendering harmless a large, 
well armed bandit formation operating over an extensive area can 
be the tactic of search and strike operations according to the 
"seek and disarm" ("destroy") principle. In this case active 
air and ground reconnaissance conducted over a wide front is 
combined with a prompt strike by helicopters and airmobile 
detachments (groups) landed in the region of operations against 
the groupings of gunmen which have been brought to light. The 
decision to rout a bandit formation includes the selection of 
the most dangerous groupings to be rendered harmless first of 
all and the determination of the combat structure and modi 
operandi of the reconnaissance and search, strike and fire, air 
assault (airmobile), raid landing, and blocking detachments 
(groups), of the means of organizing killing zones [ognevyye 
meshki], ambushes, and obstacles, and of the system of control, 
cooperation, and support. 
  This is just a small proportion of the questions connected 
with the preparation and implementation of peacemaking 
operations. Information to ponder, you might say. But it can be 
seen from this that the practical preparation of the peacemaking 
forces is a problem which concerns the Armed Forces to one 
degree or another.

<F P=106> [Interview with Col (Res) Viktor Aleksandrovich Matafonov by </F>
Aleksandr Davidyuk under the rubric "The Ataman Will Speak": 
"Viktor Matafonov: Our Line Is 300 Years Old"] 
  [Text] Viktor Matafonov was born in the year of the 
Victory. He completed a construction tekhnikum and then, as an 
external student, passed the exams for the Omsk Higher 
Combined-Arms Command School. He served 26 years in the 
Transbaykal Military District. He is a colonel in the reserve. 
Last April the military district of the Transbaykal Cossack Army 
recommended his transfer from the position of ataman of the 
Chita Cossack District to adviser to the head of the oblast 
administration for Cossack affairs. 
  [Davidyuk] To my knowledge, Viktor Aleksandrovich, the 
position of adviser for Cossack affairs to an administration has 
been established for the first time in Russia. What brought this 
about? 
  [Matafonov] We have a lot of things for the first time. I 
shall get back to that. It is just that they have begun 
considering us. We have developed from a group initiating the 
rebirth of the Cossack community into a powerful force. There is 
a Cossack population of more than 60,000 in the Transbaykal 
today. These are patriotic-minded people. Even the oblast 
authorities have turned to us. Right now a special group is 
being set up under the administration, which will work on a 
comprehensive program of economic and cultural rebirth for the 
Transbaykal Cossacks. 
  [Davidyuk] We have never had a shortage of good programs. 
But 
so many plans have remained just on paper.... 
  [Matafonov] That will not be the case with us. I am now 
working directly with top oblast authorities. In areas with a 
dense Cossack population the atamans are frequently deputy 
chiefs for social support for the population in the rayon 
administrations. What do we have to show for this. It is far 
easier to resolve all pressing matters--the allocation of land, 
for example. I am not even referring to the preparation of the 
youth to serve in the army. We are in many ways the first in 
this as well. 
  The first Cossack subunit in the Russian Army has been 
created in the Transbaykal Military District. This is the 
Daurskiy Cossack Company based with the Port Arthur Regiment. 
People throughout the nation have expressed thanks to "your 
Cossack outpost." I believe that this positive undertaking will 
be supported also in other regions of Russia. 
  Two Cossack outposts have been set up on the border with 
Mongolia and China. They guard the border jointly with the 
border troops. We have concluded an agreement on this matter 
with the district command element, although the legal aspect has 
not yet been completely worked out. I am confident that this 
will be done in the immediate future, however. 
  A Cossack patrol has been set up and is operating by 
agreement with the oblast administration and the governing body 
of the Transbaykal Cossack Army. It accompanies every train into 
the border zone together with law-enforcement agencies. It 
combats crime in rail transport. 
  [Davidyuk] In short, when the rider mounts a horse rearing 
to 
go, he had better find the stirrup at once, as the Cossacks say. 
From every indication, the Transbaykal Cossacks have done so, 
have they not? 
  [Matafonov] Yes, they have. There have been many obstacles 
on 
the path, though. The main problem is obtaining the money. We 
cannot pay wages. Thank you, Col-Gen Valeriy Stepanovich 
Tretyakov, district commander. He is coming to our rescue. The 
local administration is also chipping in. But this is all just 
kopecks. We need a lot of money to do a real job. Take the 
construction of villages, for example. There are many people who 
want to acquire their own farms. Right now 28 families want to 
move here from Kazakhstan. They are hereditary Transbaykal 
Cossacks, the Lonshakovs. They want to build a village on the 
Argun river. It is on the border with China. We shall try to 
help them. We have asked the government of Russia for help in 
paying for rail cars to move their household goods.... 
  Some officers released into the reserve also want to remain 
here. We plan to settle them along the Argun. There are 
fantastically beautiful places there, and hunting and fishing. 
It is our strategic mission to settle the border region. There 
are empty areas, the villages are deteriorating, and neighbors 
are glancing our way with increasing frequency. We welcome 
guests, of course, but they will not receive any land. The 
situation is tense there. The question of the islands in the 
Argun has come to the fore once again, and demarcation is 
underway. We are keeping a close eye on the situation, and we do 
not intend to be sideline observers. 
  [Davidyuk] You have with you an officer's saber. Where did 
you get it? 
  [Matafonov] It was given to me by the district commander. 
  [Davidyuk] Are you a hereditary Cossack? 
  [Matafonov] Our Cossack line on my mother's side, the 
Razmakhnins, is around 300 years old. My grandfather Vasiliy 
Ivanovich Matafonov commanded the 1st Cavalry Regiment in the 
Civil War. His life, by the way, is described in the novel 
"Zabaikaltsy" [The People of the Transbaikal] by the well-known 
writer Vasiliy Balyabin. We are bringing up the new generation 
in our line, our Cossack children, properly and responsibly. But 
I digress. Let us get back to public matters. 
  We have reached agreement with local television people. We 
are going to have our own program. The same goes for radio. In 
general, you will not stop us now. There is probably no force 
which could stop a Cossack. Or do you not agree? 
  [Davidyuk] Not agree with you!...

  [Text] 
<H5>  Do Not Touch Yermak! </H5>
  A large assembly of the Siberian Cossack Army was held in 
Barnaul. The Cossacks spoke with bitterness of the Russian 
government's lack of effort toward reviving the Cossack society. 
Far from all of the Cossack communities are being allocated land 
for their yurts as called for in the ukase issued by the 
President of the Russian Federation. Cossack self-government, a 
unique form of true democracy and popular rights in the past, 
has not been established in a single Cossack village. 
  The Cossacks are even more displeased by the way their 
brothers are being treated in neighboring Kazakhstan. The 
situation there is complex and tense. Indignation was aroused in 
the Cossacks by the news that Kazakh nationalists have 
desecrated the memorial to Ataman Yermak Timofeyevich, legendary 
Russian explorer. 
  The large assembly of the Siberian Cossack Army approved a 
message to the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan, which 
demands that they look into the situation and influence the 
course of events. 
<H5>  Cossacks Build Nuclear Submarines </H5>
  Another Cossack company has joined the existing ones in 
northern Russia. The charter of a Cossack association 
established at the state center of Russian nuclear shipbuilding, 
in the city of Severodvinsk, has been registered in the justice 
department of the Arkhangelsk Oblast administration. 
  The association has a membership of around 60 Cossacks. 
Their 
ataman, V. Litvinov, works as a fitter/assembler in the 
Sevmashpredpriyatiye production association, where Russia builds 
its nuclear submarines. 
  The first constructive activity of the new association, with 
which the Cossacks want to make themselves known to the city, 
has been to help maintain public order on the streets. This 
involves mounted patrols in Severodvinsk. The Pegas cooperative, 
of which Cossack V. Manevskiy is chairman, presently has only 
five horses which can be ridden by the Cossacks. That is true, 
but as they say, where there is a Cossack, a horse will be 
found. -- Vladimir Gundarov 
<H5>  Where Are the Stirrups on a Tank? </H5>
  A small Cossack assembly of the Yekaterinburg Division of 
the 
Orenburg Cossack Army discussed the establishment of a Cossack 
formation out of one of the formations of the Ural Military 
District. 
  It is planned to form the Cossack battalion in the spring of 
1994 as a Guards tank formation. The battalion is being 
established in accordance with the ukase issued by the President 
of the Russian Federation on 15 March 1993, and members of the 
Ural Cossack community will serve in it. The Sverdlovsk Oblast 
Military Commissariat has confirmed that the proper orders have 
been issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the 
Russian Federation. 
  It is symbolic that the formation in which the Cossacks will 
be serving traveled a glorious combat path during the Great 
Patriotic War as cavalrymen, replacing their battle horses with 
tanks following the war. -- Leonid Mikhaylov

"The Tbilisi Agreement: Something for Russia and Caucasian 
Peoples"] 
  [Text] Russian-Georgian summit talks began in the morning 
of 3 February in the Cabinet Ministers building located in the 
center of Tbilisi. The heads of the two states, Boris Yeltsin 
and Eduard Shevardnadze, spoke one-on-one. 
  Also held behind closed doors were meetings of official 
delegations. Oleg Soskovets, first vice premier, and Georgian 
Cabinet of Ministers Chairman Otar Patsatsiya discussed a 
complex of reciprocal, primarily economic, relations. 
  Political aspects of intergovernmental cooperation were 
taken 
up by Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev and Aleksandr 
Chikvaidze. Representing the Georgian side in the negotiations 
were Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Temporary Committee on 
the Extraordinary Situation in the Republic, and Aleksandr 
Kavsadze, chief of the State Committee on Protection of Rights 
of Man and Interethnic Relations. The agenda went beyond general 
Russian-Georgian relations to include certain aspects of the 
Abkhaz and South Ossetian problems and the situation concerning 
rights of non-native ethnic groups, particularly the Russian 
population. 
  Also held was a meeting between Russian Minister of Defense 
Army General Pavel Grachev and Major General Guram 
Nikolayshvili, chief of the General Staff of the Georgian Armed 
Forces, and Major General Paata Datyashvili. Army General Pavel 
Grachev was highly pleased with the progress of the talks, 
emphasizing that it was found possible to realize agreement on 
the entire military cooperation agenda. Incidentally, the start 
of the Russian-Georgian talks was preceded by a terrorist act: 
Georgian Deputy Minister of Defense Nikolay Kekelidze was killed 
in an explosion occurring in his apartment on 3 February. The 
minister of defense himself, Major General Georgiy 
Karkarashvili, retired from his position on the eve of the 
talks. A KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent was able to determine 
that the reason for the retirement was "unacceptability of a 
policy of establishing closer relations between Georgia and 
Russia." 
  Completion of the talks was followed by the signing of a 
package of Russian-Georgian bilateral agreements, chief of which 
was the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly Relations, and 
Cooperation. 
  Also signed was a number of intergovernmental agreements 
relating to trade and economic ties, status of Russian Border 
Troops stationed on Georgian soil, and cooperation in science 
and technology, cultural matters, education, and communications. 
One of the agreements signed that is of great importance governs 
the migration process and protects rights of settlers. Another 
agreement pertains to cooperation in prevention and clean-up 
operations in emergency situations. 
  A provision to create three Russian military bases on 
Georgian soil was set down in writing in a protocol of 
intentions signed by the representatives of the defense 
ministries of the two countries. Army General Pavel Grachev 
stated that they could be created as early as 1994, with the 
sites being Batumi, Akhalkalaki, and Vaziani. The minister of 
defense also stated that "Eduard Shevardnadze's refusal to 
accept our offer of introducing Russian peacekeeping forces into 
Abkhazia in September of 1993 was a mistake on Georgia's part." 
Pavel Grachev pointed out that this was admitted by 
representatives of Georgia's Ministry of Defense. 
  Following the signing ceremony, Boris Yeltsin and Eduard 
Shevardnadze held a joint press conference. 
  Relative to prospects of Georgia's entering into the ruble 
zone, Boris Yeltsin stated at the press conference that it was 
necessary to organize a working group which would weigh the 
positive and the negative aspects of this kind of step, and only 
after that would it be possible to make a decision. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze in principle shared Boris Yeltsin's 
view, 
adding that in Georgia there are ardent supporters and persons 
adamantly opposed to the republic's entering into the ruble zone. 
  Boris Yeltsin, responding to journalists' questions relative 
to Abkhazia's concern and alarm over the article in the 
agreement providing for military-technical cooperation, stated 
emphatically that technical assistance to Georgia is not a 
matter of the present. The military cooperation process is to 
take place gradually, in phases, tied closely to the rate of 
progress made in political settlement of the Abkhaz problem. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze in turn stated emphatically that Georgia 
will not be capable of creating an army without Russia, and she 
has no intention of posing a threat to anyone. He also said that 
he sees nothing that could preclude resolving the Abkhaz and 
South Ossetian problem. The conflict settlement process, in 
Shevardnadze's opinion, should proceed under the aegis of the UN 
and the CSCE, with the employment of peacekeeping forces, 
including those supplied by Russia. 
  In the opinion of Emil Pain, Presidential Council member, 
all 
the provisions of the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly 
Relations, and Cooperation between Russia and Georgia, which 
today was signed by the heads of the two states, are "useful for 
Russia largely in the political aspect." 
  The Presidential Council member singled out the problem of 
stationing Russian troops on Georgian soil and creating military 
bases. "Georgia," he said, "is giving a guarantee of setting up 
Russian servicemen." Emil Pain continued by saying that there is 
a complex of strategic military agreements which are of general 
significance to the CIS member countries. He cited an example: 
It would cost Russia tens of millions of rubles if she were to 
erect a new border. Also of importance are agreements made with 
Georgia which pertain to moving Russian freight through Georgia 
by land and sea. 
  Thus, the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly Relations, and 
Cooperation between Russia and Georgia has been signed. It is a 
thing already done. This is illustrated to some extent in the 
photograph of the unnamed soldier - taken by our correspondent - 
who is a member of the Russian peacekeeping forces stationed in 
South Ossetia. Thanks to young men such as he, Ossetian and 
Georgian peasants for the first time in many years of the bloody 
encounters are able to do their work as before on the land of 
their ancestors. 
  Without him, the Russian peacekeeping soldier, the knot of 
Caucasian contradictions could not be cut. And it seems that 
this is finally being recognized by those who only yesterday 
were shouting "occupier" at him. 
  In the afternoon of the day, Boris Yeltsin met with 
Patriarch 
Ilya the Second, the head of the Church of all Georgia. Later 
the President of Russia and Eduard Shevardnadze held a meeting 
with representatives of Georgia's intelligentsia. In the 
evening, Chairman of the Parliament and Head of State of the 
Republic Eduard Shevardnadze hosted an official dinner in honor 
of the President of Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA special correspondent </F>
Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysitsya under the rubric "Urgent!": 
"Expenses Instead of Profits--Or, Where To Get the Funds 
for Aircraft Maintenance?"] 
  [Text] I have had occasion to write more than once about 
the difficult situation that military aviation finds itself in 
owing to the lack of fuel. I will thus only point out that most 
pilots have not met the standards for flying time this year, and 
a considerable portion of them have lost their qualifications. 
There are units where combat readiness is maintained only by the 
leading combat crews. 
  But is the situation really hopeless for our fliers? No. I 
had occasion to be persuaded of this when I heard the 
presentations of many officials at a session of the military 
council of the VPS [Air Forces] that was just held in Vinnytsa. 
Concrete proposals were made there with regard to obtaining 
funds for fuels and lubricants, moreover through the efforts of 
the fliers themselves. I will cite only a few of them. That will 
possibly promote their realization. 
  It is no secret that some military transport aircraft are 
being used to ship the most diverse types of freight, both 
within the borders of Ukraine and to other countries. And it is 
providing quite a bit of profit, both for the state and for the 
armed forces. 
  However, as commander of the military-transport aviation 
forces Major-General of Aviation Petro Matyukhin indicated in 
his presentation to the military council, the quantity of 
aircraft for this purpose could be increased considerably--first 
of all through better organizational work. Advertising, 
clear-cut planning and timely support are all needed here. It is 
not sufficient today. So it turns out that one crew flies more 
than four hundred hours in a year, but another takes their 
aircraft up for just a few hours. 
  Matters are sometimes paradoxical with the provision of 
spare 
parts. Some parts for the aircraft are manufactured in Kiev and 
are delivered to Tashkent, to the plant where the aircraft are 
manufactured and their servicing and repairs under guarantee are 
performed. From there those parts, for example the so-called 
UZI, are returned to us again, to Ukraine, to be installed in 
aircraft; but they have now crossed the borders with customs and 
transport charges, and are thus considerably more expensive. It 
is not difficult to guess where that leads. 
  The pilots of military-transport aviation this year gained 
operational experience in yet another use of the Il-76 aircraft. 
Here, as they say, misfortune forced them to. Fires that broke 
out in the forests of the Crimea demanded the use of unusual 
measures. The military aviators were fighting the fire in their 
mighty aircraft. It would be better, of course, if they did not 
have to do such things, but no one is insured against natural 
disasters. Great fires break out at various around the globe 
every year. The pilots of military-transport aviation could take 
part in extinguishing them. Their services need only be 
requested. 
  Helicopters can be used as well as aircraft for the shipment 
of freight for so-called commercial purposes. There is a 
squadron of the giant Mi-26 helicopters, say, in the regiment 
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Mykhaylo Shymkov. These are the 
most modern rotary-winged craft, able to ship freight of many 
tonnes great distances, perform installation work and the like. 
None of them are being used today, however. The reason is that 
the main rotor blades and some other parts have exhausted their 
service lives. There is nothing with which to procure new ones 
from Russia, since our financial difficulties are well known. 
But the rotor blades do not need to be purchased. They could be 
obtained through barter, say, for engines for the same 
helicopters. Those units, after all, are manufactured here in 
Ukraine by the Motor-Sich plant. The regiment even has spare 
engines on hand. This not-very-complicated operation need only 
be organized and carried out. 
  When the Mi-26 helicopters are able to obtain their new 
"wings," they will be able to repay the funds spent on them a 
hundred times over. Great amounts of money, after all, are spent 
to install just one single derrick or electrical-transmission 
line tower, and the gain is twofold--profits for the state and 
the armed forces, and experience in practical flight work for 
the helicopter crews. All of this need only be organized and 
brought to life. 
  The Commander of the 14th Air Army, Lieutenant-General 
Viktor 
Lyashenko, pointed out in his presentation to the military 
council that quite a large quantity of aircraft in good working 
order that are not part of the regular composition of air units 
is concentrated at the aircraft repair plant in Lviv. Large sums 
of money are spent every day to preserve them and keep them in 
working order. They are moreover becoming functionally obsolete, 
and will not be suitable for use after a certain time. They 
still have value today as combat aircraft, and thus could be 
sold to those countries where such types of aircraft are in 
service. So why not sell them? 
  The storage area also has unmanned reconnaissance drones 
that 
could lose their combat capability or become functionally 
obsolete after some time. It would thus be better to sell them 
on the world arms market. Some of the funds obtained could be 
spent to develop and produce more modern aircraft of that type. 
  Quite a few surplus motor vehicles have accumulated in the 
support units of the air forces. They have been mothballed, as 
they should be, and put into long-term storage. But there are 
not suitable conditions for storage everywhere. The equipment 
moreover grows obsolete even under the best of conditions, both 
functionally and physically. Considerable amounts of funds and 
mat&eacute;riel are expended in order to preserve them and 
maintain 
them in battleworthy condition as well. A proposal was thus made 
at the military council to conduct an inventory of all surplus 
vehicles, so as to determine which it would be efficient to 
keep, as they say, for a rainy day, and which it would be best 
to get rid of while buyers can still be found for them. Some of 
the funds received could be used to buy new, contemporary models 
of vehicles that are in short supply today or could be needed in 
the future. The superfluous vehicles could otherwise be turned 
into scrap metal in several years. 
  There is another problem. Quite a few difficulties are 
arising in the aviation units with the turnover of scrap metal. 
According to the prevailing directive instructions, all should 
turn over scrap metal only to the Vtorchormet organization. 
Taking advantage of its monopoly position, however, this 
outdated state organization has been dictating its own terms. 
All aircraft have to be cut up into pieces of the appropriate 
sizes and delivered by one's own transport to the receiving 
stations. And there, under certain conditions, they will 
possibly accept them, and after some time they will possibly 
also pay at prices they set themselves. 
  It is often simply impossible to meet these conditions. 
Where 
can they get the heavy cutting apparatus? The aircraft are made 
from alloys, after all, such that they cannot be cut into pieces 
by ordinary cutting or even a simple oxyacetylene torch. And the 
scarcity of fuel reduces to a minimum the possibility of 
delivering scrap to the Vtorchormet receiving stations. Quite a 
few aircraft that have lived out their "winged" service are thus 
"rotting away" in the corners of airfields. 
  At the same time, as was emphasized at the military council, 
there are several organizations that would be glad to cut up and 
take away aircraft that are unfit for service themselves, and 
pay considerably more than the aforementioned Vtorchormet. They 
moreover do not ship the scrap metal outside the boundaries of 
our state, but rather intend to use it in Ukraine. But the 
"taboo" from above does not let them do so. So it turns out that 
it is no use to them, but they cannot give it to anyone else. 
  One could also make other proposals with regard to obtaining 
funds for the upkeep of military aviation. But these are 
certainly enough to conclude that we are still enduring losses 
in places where we could be getting profits. The approaches to 
resolving the problems must thus be changed. This should 
moreover be done today, otherwise tomorrow will be too late. The 
sources for obtaining funds could be gone, and the need for them 
could disappear if the pilots lose their combat qualifications.

<F P=106> [Report by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Valeriy Gromak: "A </F>
Big Batch of Weapons for Little Estonia, and the Estonians Will 
Produce the Ammunition Themselves"] 
  [Text] Tallin--Several Estonian enterprises are ready to 
produce NATO standard-caliber cartridges. This was announced by 
Tarmo Melder, adviser to Estonia's minister of defense. 
According to him, the first, test batch should come off the 
assembly line at the beginning of March. The adviser did not 
name the manufacturing plant, stating that the ministry of 
defense and the main staff are engaged in talks with several 
enterprises. 
  There are also counterproposals, however. The Arbadet 
joint-stock company, one of the co-owners of the Kaitseliit 
Fund, located in the city of Turi has provided its services 
to the ministry of defense. It has been learned from 
well-informed sources that the Tarkon state joint-stock company 
(formerly the Tartu Radio Equipment Plant) is also prepared to 
produce cartridges, as is the (Baliyes) enterprise (the former 
Baltiyets plant) in Narva. 
  The cartridge boom certainly did not just happen. On 3 
February Estonia signed the Partnership for Peace program, which 
apparently can absolutely not be implemented without NATO-model 
cartridges; particularly since the Israeli company Taas Israel 
Industries Ltd. recently provided Estonia with modern weapons 
conforming to NATO standards. The first ship from Israel 
delivered to the republic Galil assault rifles, (Nechev) machine 
guns, (Miniuem) submachine guns, sniper rifles, grenade 
launchers, 81mm mortars, 106mm guns, antiaircraft guns, 
missiles, guided projectiles and ammunition. 
  These weapons are sufficient for the republic to arm 12,000 
men.

<F P=106> [Article by Kestutis Junskis: "Minister of National Defense </F>
Beats Back Attacks of the Opposition"] 
  [Text] Minister of National Defense L. Linkevicius met with 
representatives of the parliamentary opposition. 
  Referring to practical endeavors which may be accomplished 
prior to the adoption of a military doctrine and national 
security concept, L. Linkevicius stressed that it is necessary 
to begin to actually control the borders and airspace of 
Lithuania. The minister said: "We should make our contribution 
to the system of collective security because so far we have to a 
certain degree been dependents." He did not reject the 
likelihood of military formations from Lithuania taking part in 
a UN peacekeeping mission, or the need for young men in service 
with the army to not only take weapons and drill training but to 
also study the English language. 
  Outlining his view of the reorganization of the DSOK 
[National Volunteer Defense Service], L. Linkevicius said that 
the reorganization does not amount to elimination of the DSOK, 
and that under the current conditions this structure could 
perform the functions of a volunteer national guard and assume 
responsibility for territorial defense and security for 
important state facilities. In the opinion of L. Linkevicius, 
from now on only those who have been in active military service, 
have been recommended by their commanders, and have impeccable 
biographies should be volunteers. 
  Seimas member P. Tupikas asked whether L. Linkevicius feels 
morally responsible for the fact that the Lithuanian Democratic 
Labor Party, while in opposition, hampered A. Butkevicius in 
creating a system of national defense, compromised it in every 
way possible, and papers were endlessly slipped to A. Brazauskas 
in the Supreme Council. L. Linkevicius answered that he did not 
engage in these affairs. 
  Seimas member A. Patackas said that "volunteers are being 
separated from their weapons," which only staff employees will 
be trusted with keeping. Such employees are few; for this 
reason, at many locations weapons are kept solely at command 
posts. In the words of A. Patackas, in this situation the main 
principle is violated: "A volunteer should always have his 
weapon handy." 
  A. Patackas expressed concern in conjunction with the fact 
that a structural reorganization is also being planned after the 
certification of volunteers in the course of which, according to 
his information, they rejected the services of at least 
one-third of the volunteers. The member of Seimas called on the 
minister to remember that volunteers are a patriotic force, too; 
in turn, the minister observed that patriotism is not a 
profession, and genuine patriots cannot compromise the DSOK. 
  Minister of National Defense L. Linkevicius said that 
weapons 
should be stored strictly in keeping with the rules. The 
argument that the volunteers might need armaments at any moment 
in order to repulse enemy attacks did not convince him. L. 
Linkevicius said: "We do not have this kind of situation now," 
and repeated yet again that weapons are not toys. 
  The minister rejected rebukes that he did not demand 
allocation of more funds from the 1994 budget for the system of 
national defense. The minister of defense said: "Being a member 
of the government, I cannot fail to think about education and 
health care, too." In the words of L. Linkevicius, there will be 
sufficient funds for military training; however, it may become 
necessary to reduce the army.

<F P=106> [Report by Ona Mickeviciute: "Bird's-Eye and Close Views of </F>
Lithuanian Military Airports"] 
  [Excerpts] As TIESA has already reported, the military 
airports transferred by Russia have not yet been utilized until 
now. 
  It has been reiterated what valuable assets we have 
received, 
because Lithuania, recognized by the former USSR as a 
strategically excellent territory, has inherited 12 military 
airports. Many of them are situated in forests and remote 
places. No one cares about some of them, while disputes are 
continuing about the others. 
  The Lithuanian president, his advisers, the Seimas 
[parliament], and its National Security Committee will discuss 
the utilization of the airports in strengthening Lithuania's 
national defense. This will require objective information. 
  On 2 February, a group of officials had a chance to see the 
airports from both the bird's-eye and close views and explore 
the actual situation and the prospects for their utilization. 
[passage omitted] 
  First of all, the group went to Kazlu Ruda airport in a Mi-8 
helicopter. Currently, the airport is under the National 
Defense Ministry ownership. Formerly, it belonged to the 
seventh USSR airborne battalion occupying a 60-hectare area. 
The airport has a 200-meter-long runway, several garages and 
storehouses, 12 wooden barracks, the framework of the officers' 
apartment block, and a two-storied underground emergency dugout 
for the USSR air force command. Almost all of these buildings 
have been either taken away or destroyed to prevent their 
utilization. The edifices lack radiators, electric cables, 
windows, and doors. Nor are there any aviation facilities. 
  Servicemen from the Kaunas motorized battalion of the field 
army brigade are working in Kazlu Ruda now. They are guarding 
the premises, repairing the facilities, and learning the art of 
war. 
  Colonel S. Murza, deputy air force commander, said that, 
thus 
far, military aviators had been unable to use the Kazlu Ruda 
base. There are plans to turn the latter into a training base 
and to station a squadron there, so that war pilots could gather 
in one place to perform common assignments. [passage omitted] 
  Incidentally, the Latvian military would also like to have 
its pilots trained in Lithuania (we have already trained their 
first two war aviators). The Latvians would contribute finances 
and assist in restructuring the base. In addition, Kazlu Ruda 
should house a duty air unit. 
  J. Lasinskas, chief of the training squadron at the rear 
service, who is also acting commander, said that the base was 
built on concrete blocks which were laid on poles driven into a 
swamp. All underground conduits are close to the surface or on 
it, the pipes are ruined, and there is no money to replace them. 
[passage omitted] The pavement is good, and it has only grown 
over with grass over the past couple of years. The Kazlu Ruda 
airport has no commercial value, and no one claims it. From the 
viewpoint of military strategy, the airport cannot be neglected. 
  Having flown over the Paliepiai airport, we found out that 
its 3,500-meter-long and 80-meter-wide runway consisted of 
10,000 concrete blocks, 1,000 of which had been sold by the 
Russian soldiers. Fuel reservoirs had been sold to Lithuanian 
and Latvian firms. There had once been plans to use the blocks 
from Paliepiai in restructuring the Vilnius airport. The 
Paliepiai airport had belonged to the USSR naval force and had 
been an emergency base for long-distance planes. 
  The Kedainiai airport has become the property of the 
self-government. 
  After landing at the airport in Meskuiciai, we found all the 
Lithuanian military aircraft -- fighters, training planes, and 
helicopters -- stored under the open winter sky. [passage 
omitted] Those are not top-class planes. Therefore, they are 
not leak-proof, and water easily gets into their engines. Only 
the Zokniai airport has sufficiently spacious hangars suitable 
for storing planes. However, these facilities have been 
assigned to the Siauliai self-government. 
  The military facilities accumulated in Meskuiciai can hardly 
undergo major repairs because there is no equipment or spare 
parts. A group of highly skilled engineers with higher aviation 
education is trying to make spare parts itself, and it is 
gradually repairing all planes and helicopters deployed in 
Meskuiciai. 
  A conference held at the Meskuiciai base put forward the 
following idea: Does the National Defense Ministry [KAM] have a 
chance of acquiring at least some of the necessary buildings and 
hangars at the Zokniai airport? Air Force Deputy Commander S. 
Murza delivered a report about the key goals of Lithuania's 
aviation. These are control over the state borders and the 
Baltic Sea economic zone, and the supervision of the 
inviolability of the entire air space. Aviation should also 
engage in rescue operations, assist other army units in 
performing special assignments, and transfer other military 
units, servicemen, equipment, and facilities. In addition, 
aviation should also perform photographic work from the air and 
the radiation and chemical surveillance of the territory. 
  According to the speaker, Lithuania needs three airports. 
The most suitable ones are in Zokniai (Siauliai region), 
Pajuoste (Panevezys region), and Kazlu Ruda (Marijampole 
region). It was expected a year and a half ago that the Zokniai 
airport would become the first strategic airport in northern 
Lithuania. It has the best hangars built in 1989, new 
buildings, the possibility of installing a good flight control 
center, and so on. 
  It has a particularly good 3,500-meter-long runway (which 
was 
also an emergency runway for the spaceship "Buran"). The KAM 
received the buildings situated on both sides of the runway 
which cannot be used for cars. The zone for fighters, the 
launching pad, the parking lots for heavy planes and vehicles, 
the headquarters of the radioelectronic combat regiment, and the 
laboratory went to Siauliai City. "The security of entire 
Lithuania was sacrificed for the benefit of the city and for 
temporary finances," stressed Colonel S. Murza. "The airport 
which was too large for Russia has become too small for 
Lithuania." The self-government has forbidden the military even 
to drive across its territory. Therefore, quite a long road 
will have to be built on the other side. This might cost the 
military about 0.5 million litai. 
  The conference was also addressed by Captain J. Marcinkus, 
commander of the first air base, who noted that the runway 
belonged to the self-government, but that the services for 
maintenance, navigation, and flight control could be common -- 
as is the case around the world. The self-government uses only 
part of the buildings (which the aviators need). The 
devastation of many facilities is continuing. The compact 
territory belonging to the self-government has all the buildings 
necessary for the normal work of the national defense air force, 
for the organization of the air defense, and for the 
installation of repair and engineering facilities, laboratories, 
and a maintenance unit. 
  In the opinion of A. Norvilas, the president's adviser for 
national defense issues, and A. Orenius, adviser to the Seimas 
National Security Committee, a special commission should be set 
up and a project drafted for national defense. The fate of the 
Zokniai airport might change then. The decision of the former 
B. Lubys' government concerning the division of the airport will 
not be revoked unless there are some serious arguments. 
However, A. Norvilas told a TIESA correspondent that military 
aviators should be supported. 
  From Meskuiciai we flew to Zokniai and inspected the 
deplorable buildings allotted to the KAM. After the "excursion" 
in Zokniai, the airport in Pajuoste (Panevezys region) looked 
tidy and well-groomed. [passage omitted] Thus, the restoration 
of the Pajuoste airport may not require large finances, if the 
decision to use this heritage for Lithuania's national defense 
is adopted.

<F P=106> [Igor Andreyev report: "Russian Military Commissariats </F>
Recruited Mercenaries for Azerbaijan's Army"] 
  [Excerpts] At least 150 Russian mercenaries from Tula, 
Kaluga, Ivanovo, Tambov, and Vladimir Oblasts were recruited in 
December of last year by representatives of the Azerbaijani Army 
with the participation of local Military Commissariats, and were 
dispatched to the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijani military 
conflict. Documentary evidence proving this fact is in the 
hands of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], which 
was the first to pay attention to the strange behavior -- to put 
it mildly -- by officials in the Russian Armed Forces. 
  The ill-starred mercenaries, who have already left the army 
of sovereign Azerbaijan, are today unanimously talking about an 
entirely legal recruitment campaign for contract servicemen 
which was launched by the oblast military commissariats at the 
end of last year. Judging by the advertisements that were 
posted, the call was to service in CIS "hotspots." The terms 
were tempting: 500,000 rubles [R] per month, one-half of this 
sum in dollars. It did not occur to any of the dozens of people 
who fell for these promises that the recruitment was not to the 
Russian Army but to the armed forces of another state. The 
volunteers did not immediately realize what they were joining, 
even after a visit to the military commissariat. Some read the 
terms for themselves, while others were kept in the dark until 
the last moment. One thing unites them all -- when flying out 
to Baku every one of them knew where they were going and what 
for. 
  A. and N. from Kaluga (the editorial office has their full 
details) were immediately given to understand what was going on 
by staffers of Kaluga's Leninskiy Rayon Military Commissariat, 
who said: "Go to Azerbaijan as mercenaries. You will be able 
to get a large sum of money. War is of course a risk, but you 
can make a profit from it...." When the volunteers were brought 
to the assembly point, there were around 60 men already there 
from various rayons in the oblast. Addressing them, A. and N. 
recall, the oblast military commissar did not speak about 
Azerbaijan, but only said that where the detachment was going 
"people only died through stupidity." He did not give a direct 
answer to the question: "Are we going to Azerbaijan?", 
reporting that representatives of the recipient military unit 
would arrive in the next few days, and they would explain 
everything. 
  B. from Kaluga came to the Oktyabrskiy Rayon Military 
Commissariat following an appeal on local television by a 
staffer of the Oblast Military Commissariat, who announced the 
recruitment of reservists for service in CIS "hotspots." 
Convinced that this concerned the Russian Army, B. arrived in 
the city of Yefremov, where the Kaluga volunteers were united 
with the Tambov volunteers. There, for the first time, he saw 
the "representative of the recipient military unit," elderly 
Azerbaijani Guseynov, wearing badges of military rank unknown to 
B. on his military tunic under his civilian coat. In 
mid-December, the combined detachment went via Moscow to Ivanovo 
airport, where they united with the contract servicemen from 
Ivanovo and Vladimir. On 20 December, 92 mercenaries flew out 
to Baku by an Azerbaijani civil aviation Tu-154. 
  According to Ch. from Kaluga, the recruitment of volunteers 
was done with the most active participation of officials of the 
oblast military commissariat, who closely cooperated with 
representatives of the Azerbaijani Army. However, as a rule, 
neither the Russian military nor their foreign colleagues 
enlarged on the ultimate aim of the impending visit. They even 
kept silent when all the volunteers knew the truth. The 
Azerbaijanis, the mercenaries recall, freely made use of the 
military commissariat reservists' discount cards, bought them 
food in cafes using cash, and apparently did not suffer from any 
shortage of funds. [passage omitted] 
  All the former mercenaries questioned by the FCS are 
convinced that the oblast military commissars and their 
subordinates who were working directly with the contract 
servicemen could not have failed to realize that they were 
assisting in the recruitment of Russian citizens to a foreign 
army. That they participated in deceiving volunteers who did 
not initially suspect where they were going to serve. The 
aforementioned A. stated that staffers of local military 
commissariats had "set up" the volunteers, that all the 
Azerbaijanis' conversations with the mercenaries were conducted 
in the presence of Russian military, and the latter responded 
immediately to the requests of "the representatives of the 
military unit"....[passage omitted] 
  Although not a single legislative act mentions the concept 
of 
"mercenary" at the moment, according to many of my interlocutors 
from the FCS, the actions of the military commissariats fully 
come under Article 171 of the Russian Federation Penal Code, 
which covers cases when officials exceed their power and 
authority to the detriment of Russia's interests. No matter 
which side we look from, the damage is clear: The country may 
be accused of supporting the idea of mercenaries, while the 
Russian Army failed to recruit all the contract servicemen which 
it might have recruited. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation 
Armed Forces command is apparently not noticing the December 
"recruitment," just like it did not notice such cases in the 
past. As [counterintelligence officer] Vladimir Makarov claims, 
the "signals" about the flourishing mercenary business had 
already reached the military department, the former Supreme 
Soviet, and the Prosecutor's Office. 
  On 23 February, the FCS leadership (let us note that the 
department managed to "unravel" this story in a situation 
extremely unfavorable to itself, straight after the president's 
December edict on abolishing the Russian Ministry of Security) 
officially sent a letter to Colonel General M. Kolesnikov, chief 
of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, setting 
forth all the circumstances of the case. The IZVESTIYA 
editorial office is also waiting for the reply. 
  When called by IZVESTIYA, Mikhail Petrovich Kolesnikov, with 
whom we are well acquainted because of the January 1990 events 
in Baku, answered that he does not know anything about the 
involvement of Russian military commissariats in the recruitment 
of mercenaries for the Azerbaijani Army. He considers claims 
about such cases as someone's conjectures, and the conversation 
essentially premature. "When we obtain documents from the FCS, 
we will conduct our own investigation, and then we will return 
to this subject...."

<F P=106> [Interview with Serzh Sarkisyan, minister of defense of the </F>
Republic of Armenia, by Mikhail Serdyukov in Yerevan; date not 
given: "Minister of Defense of the Republic of Armenia Serzh 
Sarkisyan: `Why Do We, Lieutenant, Need Foreign Land?': When I 
Turn My Ardor to My Family, It Means the War Has Ended..."] 
  [Text] ...And it seemed that this happened yesterday. 
There were more bullets than people on the streets of blockaded 
Stepanakert. Serzh said to me: "We are being shot at like in a 
shooting gallery. But all this will end soon. We will take 
Shusha (the city fort, a former health resort on a high hill 
overlooking Stepanakert--Mikhail Serdyukov)." 
  Shusha seemed to be and was inaccessible. There was 
incessant firing from there: cannons, "barrages," and when the 
snipers aimed, it was always for the forehead. Only an 
out-and-out Suvorov or a totally mad descendant would dare to 
assault this monster. Serzh is a person without extremes. He 
just established an army of self-defense forces of Artsakh. He 
is a philologist. 
  They took Shusha. And a lot more. They moved military 
operations beyond the boundaries of Nagorno-Karabakh. Serzhik 
became a national hero. Researchers will also study the 
phenomenon of this commander. But for the present... 
  For the present, there is a new blockade. Of all 
Armenia already. An economic blockade, and it is the most 
merciless. There is no light or gas, and there is little to eat. 
The army is shattered. The president of the republic invites 
Serzh Sarkisyan to the post of minister of defense of Armenia. 
He is surprised, but he leaves his family in Stepanakert and 
goes to frozen Yerevan. This is where we met. 
  [Serdyukov] I have already been warned: It is the practice 
in 
the higher echelons of Armenian authority to use strictly 
official forms of address: "Mr. President, Mr. Minister." How 
should I address you? 
  [Sarkisyan] As an old friend. 
  [Serdyukov] Thank you, Serzhik. What kind of songs is the 
minister of defense singing today? 
  [Sarkisyan] I am still a long way off from a personal 
performance. But I like to listen to the White Guard's songs. 
Malinin's, for example. 
  [Serdyukov] He sings sincerely: "Why do we, lieutenant, need 
foreign land?" If I readdress this question to you--will you be 
able to answer it? 
  [Sarkisyan] Go ahead and ask: Why did you seize Azerbaijani 
territory. In autumn of 1992 we were able to stop the 
Azerbaijani Army and got an opportunity to keep 
Nagorno-Karabakh. But how was this to be done? After all, 
Stepanakert was being battered by cannon from the well-known 
Agdam--point-blank. You even took a picture of a little girl 
with a broken leg--have you forgotten? 
  [Serdyukov] Can you really forget such a thing? Do you know 
how she is living now? 
  [Sarkisyan] She is alive. But others died. Azerbaijani Army 
groups that were concentrated on our borders continued to hit 
cities and villages. After all, every sector of the republic was 
fired on from there. And that could have gone on endlessly. It 
is impossible to compare Azerbaijan's military potential in any 
way even with that of Armenia, not to mention the NKR 
[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]. There are not many Karabakh 
residents. And there was only one solution: Only through bravery 
and attack could we demoralize the huge Azerbaijani force. We 
circulated the disinformation that allegedly we were appeased. 
We said that we expected the next attack of the Azerbaijani Army 
in the spring of 1993. And we gave assurances: They will not 
attack us in the winter and, of course, everyone could ease up... 
  [Serdyukov] And did they take the bait? 
  [Sarkisyan] Yes. In January of 1993 the Azerbaijanis began a 
powerful offensive in the firm conviction that we were not ready 
to repel them. Within two weeks they were completely exhausted. 
We launched a counteroffensive. The aim was to straighten out 
the front. This required going outside the NKR's boundaries. 
  [Serdyukov] You really got outside them very well! You 
captured up to one-fifth of the entire Republic of Azerbaijan. 
You were suddenly transformed from defenders of your own land to 
aggressors. 
  [Sarkisyan] Of course, for Azerbaijan, this is aggression. 
Although there is a nuance: After all, they do not recognize the 
NKR as an independent state, and continue to consider the 
Karabakh people as their subjects. So, what kind of aggression 
is this? Our people against our people. I will say frankly: We 
do not need their land. We were simply ensuring the safety of 
our families. And supplying the army with captured weapons. 
Furthermore, Karabakh has been completely destroyed and burned 
down. Three years of war is no joke. But with what does one 
rebuild? At whose expense? There is nothing in Armenia, and the 
mice are dying from hunger in empty cornbins. There was only one 
solution: Get the building materials in Azerbaijan. 
  [Serdyukov] In Azerbaijan they think they are fighting 
against Armenia. 
  [Sarkisyan] They can be understood. It is embarrassing to 
admit that, having such a powerful military potential, they 
cannot achieve victory over tiny Karabakh. Although I know: They 
clearly realize this among themselves. They do not want to admit 
publicly in Baku that they are at war with Karabakh. After all, 
they have been unable up to now to take even one Armenian 
soldier captive. I met with the minister of defense of 
Azerbaijan in Tbilisi recently at the initiative of Russian 
General Reut. He tried to prove to me that regular subunits of 
the Armenian Army were participating in the war. He showed me 
the identity papers of a captured soldier with the inscription 
"Volunteer." A passport with the registration is Yerevan. I 
explained to him simply, in the Russian language--in the 
presence of Reut: We have many prisoners, both Russian and 
Ukrainian, but I am not saying that Karabakh is at war with 
Russia or with Ukraine. 
  [Serdyukov] Does this mean that you did not succeed in 
coming 
closer to an agreement with your Azerbaijani colleague? 
  [Sarkisyan] We did not achieve anything. This meeting was an 
initiative of the Russian general. His personal initiative. 
Without any authority from Moscow. As he said: "He has great 
personal desire for this war to end more quickly." 
  [Serdyukov] But what about you, do you have another desire? 
  [Sarkisyan] God forbid! And the Azerbaijan minister of 
defense wants the same. 
  [Serdyukov] A paradox: Everyone wants peace, and the carnage 
continues. 
  [Sarkisyan] The trouble is that an end to the war means 
different things for us and for them. For Karabakh, the end of 
the war is recognition of independence. But for Azerbaijan, as 
their minister of defense put it, "the return of all of the 
administrative units, including Karabakh as well..." 
  [Serdyukov] But this is a closed circle! With the arrival of 
Geydar Aliyev, a cautious person, the hope has emerged in you 
personally that you will finally come to an agreement? 
  [Sarkisyan] When he came to power I did have this kind of 
hope. Alas, it has now been dispelled. Under Aliyev, Azerbaijan 
ended up completely militarized. Everything there is now 
absolutely subordinated to war. The people, the economy. 
  [Serdyukov] Are there really no prospects? 
  [Sarkisyan] I do not see any, and there is already no choice 
now even for Aliyev. Because many people perished during his 
time. He has to have at least some kind of justification for 
this. I am confident that if in a month Azerbaijan loses a 
million or two million soldiers, but at the same time returns 
some part of their territory, no one will begin to reproach 
Aliyev. The sacrifices will be justified. But if he does not 
succeed in achieving anything, he will be held responsible, as 
others were. 
  [Serdyukov] What millions are you talking about? What is 
this, world war? 
  [Sarkisyan] But already today almost twice as many have been 
killed in Azerbaijan as in the whole war in Afghanistan. 
According to the most conservative figures, 25,000-26,000! And 
in Aliyev's opinion, 3,500 persons are in captivity in Karabakh, 
800--in Armenia. 
  [Serdyukov] But how many in fact? 
  [Sarkisyan] We do not have that many prisoners. He is 
confusing them with those who are missing in action. But we even 
earlier asked to gather up the bodies. However, the Azerbaijanis 
did not do this. Why? Well, so that the people would have no 
idea of the extent of their own losses. And they are not 
gathering up the bodies now. Although Karabakh is ready to grant 
this opportunity at any time. 
  [Serdyukov] How big are Armenia's losses? 
  [Sarkisyan] One of ours against 12 Azerbaijanis. 
  [Serdyukov] Serzhik, what about a campaign against Baku? 
While sitting at one time at a Karabakh table I also had 
occasion to hear this outlook from the mouths of soldiers of the 
self-defense army. 
  [Sarkisyan] This was a joke, very likely, a drunken one. You 
understand, Azerbaijan has an objective, and after achieving it, 
it will conclude the war. Enter Stepanakert--that is all. 
Period! Karabakh does not have an objective at present. It has 
one task: to stand at the present line and repel attacks. There 
is no point now for a Karabakh soldier to reach so that the war 
will end. We do not need Baku, nor on the whole even one 
centimeter of land. And the Karabakhs will return all the 
territory of Azerbaijan without vacillation as soon as they 
receive guarantees that they will not shoot in the direction of 
their motherland. 
  [Serdyukov] What kind of guarantees are you talking about? 
  [Sarkisyan] Recognizing the Karabakh Republic. The 
introduction of peacekeeping forces in the area of conflict. We 
cannot believe in words anymore. After all, even in the 
Azerbaijan system Karabakh was autonomous and had some 
guarantees according to the USSR Constitution. 
  [Serdyukov] I have already been shivering with cold with 
everybody in Armenia for a week. I met quite a few Yerevan 
people who curse the war to the hilt. They are convinced that it 
is precisely Karabakh that brought them to complete 
impoverishment, chronic freezing, and a life of semistarvation. 
Do you not consider the possibility of exacerbating 
Armenian-Karabakh relations? 
  [Sarkisyan] Now is not the time for division. Only unity 
will 
save us today. And the leadership of Armenia declared more than 
once that it agrees to any decisions at which the two 
belligerents arrive. There would be peace. 
  [Serdyukov] Will it not become boring for you to live in 
peace and quiet? What will you occupy yourself with, as minister 
of defense? Or as philologist Serzhik Sarkisyan? 
  [Sarkisyan] I have not thought about this. But I know one 
thing: The first day of peace will be the happiest day of my 
life. But as a philologist, perhaps I have lost many 
professional qualities. 
  [Serdyukov] What is your specialization? 
  [Sarkisyan] The Armenian language and literature. I 
graduated 
from the University of Yerevan and returned home--you know how 
closely I was watched in Karabakh by the Azerbaijani leaders. To 
them, a person who received his education in Armenia and had 
some ideas and national habits was considered a social outcast. 
But I was invited to the city party committee of the Komsomol 
[All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], and I became the 
supervisor of the sports and mass-defense branch. Then I became 
the secretary. There I really felt the pressure. All "lucrative" 
positions went only to one's own. They spat on the Armenian 
language. It was forbidden to write and speak it. But after all, 
Armenians living in the NKAO [Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous 
Oblast] comprised 70 percent of the total population. 
  [Serdyukov] Peace is as good a time as any for language. But 
what will you do with the uniform of a military minister? 
  [Sarkisyan] Well, I do not have any kind of uniform. 
Remember 
the old camouflage uniform I wore in Karabakh? It is in my 
wardrobe. This is my entire military dress. 
  [Serdyukov] But what about the gold shoulderboards? After 
all, the minister has some kind of rank? 
  [Sarkisyan] Captain of the Reserve. But this goes back to 
peaceful times long ago. What am I supposed to do, confer a rank 
upon myself? How could I then look into the eyes of the 
professional military? After the capture of Shusha, while still 
in Karabakh, they wanted to promote me to general--I refused. I 
consider myself a civilian to this day. But I became military, 
even if the minister, out of necessity. On the other hand, when 
I meet with ministers of defense of other states (they are all 
marshals), I am not intimidated. I am dressed in civilian 
clothes, and I converse with them as an equal. Military rank 
obligates one to something. And then I am not a particular 
expert in military commands. I show up among the troops in a 
regular suit. 
  [Serdyukov] But how do you command... without commands? 
  [Sarkisyan] My favorite command is "forward!" Everyone knows 
this. 
  [Serdyukov] Is this when, pistol in hand, you lead soldiers 
in an attack? 
  [Sarkisyan] That also has happened. But I was not minister 
of 
defense of Armenia at the time. 
  [Serdyukov] Were there many military in your family? 
  [Sarkisyan] Not one. A grandfather was shot in 1937. He was 
a 
shepherd. My father was a blacksmith since the age of 13. He has 
been on pension a long time, but until now he has been in the 
Stepanakert defense rayon repairing weapons. Mama has worked all 
her life at the silk combine. In Nagorno-Karabakh. My wife, a 
music teacher, and two of my daughters are there now. 
  [Serdyukov] Why do you not take them to Yerevan? 
  [Sarkisyan] It is warmer there. And although the bombing has 
started again, both daughters are going to school. No one will 
be going to school in Armenia before spring. 
  [Serdyukov] But the territory of Armenia is also being fired 
on now. We already have the first victims. Is yet another war 
starting? 
  [Sarkisyan] We could respond to these provocations with 
power 
strikes. But, after all, this will really lead to a wide-scale 
war. I see two reasons here. With these incidents, the 
Azerbaijanis, thinking that our army is fighting in Karabakh, 
are allegedly trying to draw off some of our forces. And to show 
to the whole world that they are fighting Armenia, but not 
Karabakh. We are avoiding such a war in every possible way. 
Although I should put our aircraft into the air, and a strike 
from which they will not recover quickly will be delivered. 
  [Serdyukov] Are the pilots, excuse the stupid question, 
Russian? 
  [Sarkisyan] You are being insulting. They are all Armenian. 
  [Serdyukov] Incidentally, nothing has been heard for a long 
time about the pilots who were knocked down in the Stepanakert 
skies--a Russian and a Ukrainian. I met with one of them, pilot 
Bilichenko, two years ago in prison. He was convinced he would 
be shot. 
  [Sarkisyan] Of course, they are criminals. But I think that 
their life should be spared. But this is not their war, why did 
they get into it? 
  [Serdyukov] And are the mujahidin fighting in Karabakh now? 
  [Sarkisyan] Afghanistan has not admitted this fact 
officially. I think they are right. After all, a mujahidin is 
not a soldier of the Afghan Army. They are ordinary mercenaries. 
  [Serdyukov] Have you succeeded in taking any of them 
captive? 
  [Sarkisyan] Not for the time being. They fight in the rear. 
They stand as defensive detachments, and they shoot retreating 
Azerbaijani soldiers. But there is a captive Turkish officer. I 
know for a certainty: There are many Russian, Ukrainian, and 
Belarusian officers fighting. 
  [Serdyukov] Do you have enough such volunteers on your part? 
  [Sarkisyan] We do not have mujahidin, believe me. 
  [Serdyukov] Tell me, please, is your army helping Karabakh 
with weapons? 
  [Sarkisyan] We acquired some things for them in third 
countries, in the West. But this is meager in comparison with 
what the Azerbaijanis are losing themselves and what the 
Karabakhs acquire after successful strikes of the NKR defense 
army. This is on the order of 120 tanks, powerful artillery, and 
whole depots of infantry weapons and ammunition. Even the 
Armenian Army does not have such stores of weapons as there are 
now in Karabakh. 
  [Serdyukov] But where did Azerbaijan get so many weapons? 
  [Sarkisyan] They do not have to go far. A hundred tanks were 
acquired recently in Ukraine. Also aircraft and ammunition. 
Incidentally, they do not deny this there. They justify it by 
the difficult economic situation. In addition, according to the 
information of prisoners and captured materiel, it can be said 
that Azerbaijan acquired many new T-72 tanks. Where? It is 
obvious to us: Russia. For example, in Nikolayev they received 
BMP-2's [infantry combat vehicle] not so long ago. Ammunition 
was delivered from Tula. 
  [Serdyukov] Does our Grachev deny all this? 
  [Sarkisyan] Of course. The entire Russian leadership, 
civilian and military, flatly refuse to admit their military 
assistance to Azerbaijan. It is just a pity that your country 
does not take one thing into account: Our enemy is acquiring 
weapons not only from the countries of the near abroad. In 
China--assault rifles. In the Czech Republic--machine guns and 
grenade launchers produced in 1993. All this firepower falls on 
tiny Karabakh. But how is one to understand this from the human 
standpoint? 
  [Serdyukov] Well, fine, but did you not have a conversation 
in this regard with Grachev himself. By telephone, but 
man-to-man? 
  [Sarkisyan] Our president engages in this. But I think that 
if there was a conversation with Grachev, it would not have 
changed very much. The chaos that exists in the arms trade, in 
my opinion, cannot even be controlled by the minister of defense 
of Russia. 
  [Serdyukov] If you had the opportunity to talk with our 
president, what would you say to him? 
  [Sarkisyan] I want to request one thing of Yeltsin and of 
all 
Russians: Act in such a way that our Karabakh does not perish. 
You are powerful. Help us. 
  [Serdyukov] I know that general mobilization was declared in 
Azerbaijan a long time ago. What is the case in this respect in 
Armenia? 
  [Sarkisyan] The minister of defense does not need this. For 
the time being. But it is difficult for me to guess what will 
occur tomorrow. 
  [Serdyukov] Have you gotten very tired in recent years? Do 
you have a desire to lie in bed for a few days and at least once 
to sleep as much as you want? 
  [Sarkisyan] I would not refuse, of course. I do not get more 
than five hours of sleep a day. But then I think of the boys who 
are fighting today in the mountains in 40 degrees of frost. For 
two-three months in the forward area... 
  [Serdyukov] What is your biggest misfortune in life--what is 
it associated with? 
  [Sarkisyan] I have lost so many friends in recent years. 
These were fellows who deserved to live. The sadness is not to 
meet with them anymore on this earth. 
  [Serdyukov] Serzhik, for these years of the war, your chest 
should be glistening with medals. 
  [Sarkisyan] But there are no combat decorations in Armenia. 
There are in Karabakh: combat crosses of the first and second 
degree. Azerbaijan has the title of national hero. They are fine 
fellows. 
  [Serdyukov] And what cross do you have? 
  [Sarkisyan] Imagine, I have none. 
  [Serdyukov] And if you had some free time, what would you 
engage in? 
  [Sarkisyan] I would go hunting in our Karabakh forests. 
There 
is no more beautiful place on earth. With Robert Kocharyan, my 
boyhood friend. He shoots very accurately. With a rifle. 
  [Serdyukov] Better than you? 
  [Sarkisyan] We have not competed for a long time. 
  [Serdyukov] Did you have occasion to shoot in the war? 
  [Sarkisyan] Rarely--but it happened. 
  [Serdyukov] Do you get a chance to read books? 
  [Sarkisyan] To my great regret, no. 
  [Serdyukov] And you have probably not seen your family for a 
long time? 
  [Sarkisyan] I have a real Armenian family. The husband 
commands in it. I like this most of all. 
  [Serdyukov] Do you really have little to command at work? 
  [Sarkisyan] Too much. 
  [Serdyukov] But what is the matter? 
  [Sarkisyan] The fact that when I turn my ardor to my family, 
it means the war has ended.

Full-Strength Army by Spring"] 
  [Text] [words illegible] successfully. This statement was 
heard at a briefing of state minister of the Republic of Armenia 
and Chairman of the Republic Call-Up Commission Vazgen 
Sarkisyan, at which Major General Artur 
Arutyunyan, chief of the republic's Main Mobilization 
Administration, was also present. 
  According to the state minister's report, the republic 
call-up has been fulfilled by 100.16 percent. These are not 
simply figures--a real person stands behind each of them. For 
the first time in the past four years the call-up was organized 
and conducted on the exterritorial principle, i.e., none of the 
conscripts, not counting individual exceptions, will serve in 
the places of his immediate [words illegible]. However, as he 
noted, there are still regions where the call-up periods have 
been extended for good reason. In particular, in Gyumr and 
Vanadzora it will go on for another 10 days in order to bring 
the lacking 511 and 244 persons respectively up to strength. 
  Thus, speaking in military fashion, the task has been 
accomplished. However, the task is not limited only to a 
quantitative aspect. It also has a qualitative side which must 
be made sure of by thorough, daily, and goal-directed work in 
the units. Otherwise,the successfully completed first stage of 
the campaign will prove to be a useless waste of effort, time, 
and funds. Actually, it is already possible today to talk about 
the existence of the institution of the organizing of national 
armed forces. Now the matter depends on the improvement of their 
military training and combat readiness, as well as on the 
establishment of general army discipline. Incidentally, 
according to Mr. Sarkisyan, a number of commanders of different 
ranks have been relieved of duty for non-fulfillment of these 
requirements as well as for inability to create conditions for 
the psychological "assimilation" of new recruits and lack of 
skill in investigating their non-regulation (neustavnyy) 
interrelations, which has led to certain accidents. Some 147 
deserters are already on the run from this recruitment through 
the fault of such apologies for commanders. Criminal punishments 
will be applied to them. 
  Basically the call-up went without hindrance and in an 
organized manner. 
  At the same time, as the briefing participants noted, there 
are still parents who suffer from the "defect" of protecting 
beloved children from service in the army in every way possible. 
Such psychology is characteristic also of refugees from 
Azerbaijan and the Yezids who consitute a national minority in 
the republic. Nevertheless, the assurance was expressed that as 
a result of the appropriate actions this situation will be set 
right by spring, i.e., by the next call-up. 
  Answering the journalists' questions, the speakers reported 
about the intention to conduct regular inspections in military 
units which will make it possible to eliminate shortcomings and 
to resolve various problems. Today, in the words of the state 
minister, they have no problems with food and clothing. There 
exists only a problem with barracks. The fact is that in the 
southern part of the republic there are none at all and one must 
build new ones or [word illegible] old ones. [word illegible] 
important task one can [word illegible], the latest news [word 
illegible] also in the creation of higher educational 
institutions which will permit replenishment of the ranks of the 
national army with highly educated and skilled officers. 
  In conclusion Mr. Sarkisyan expressed gratitude to all the 
services that participated in the call-up campaign: The rayon 
military commisariats, internal affairs organs, military police 
personnel, and local authorities as well as the journalists 
present for assistance in the successful completion of the 
autumn call-up.

<F P=106> [Letter of General Designers to Yeltsin: "Guns Back Up to </F>
the Market"] 
  [Text] Very esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! 
  In the course of the last two years, a new system for the 
organization of military-technical cooperation with foreign 
countries was worked out and established through the joint 
efforts of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the 
Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, and the defense 
industry. A fundamental reorganization of the system for the 
export of arms was begun under the leadership of the 
Interdepartmental Commission on military-Technical Cooperation. 
  At the present time, a number of stages of the plan for the 
reorganization of military-technical cooperation approved by the 
Government of the Russian Federation have already been realized: 
  --a consultative and supervisory council under the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations made up of representatives of 
developers and manufacturers of export arms has been established 
and is working actively; 
  --financing-industrial groups oriented toward the export of 
arms have begun to be formed and a new system is being 
established for the interaction of defense enterprises with 
specialized foreign economic associations of the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations ("Oboroneksport," 
"Spetsvneshtekhnika," and GUSK); 
  --a powerful and reliable system of military-technical 
cooperation is being established that relies on developers and 
manufacturers of arms employing the structures of the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations, which will provide for the 
comprehensive servicing and modernization of domestic military 
equipment at the foreign customer and will expand the volume and 
forms of exports and services for technical assistance to the 
foreign buyer; 
  --certain changes have been made in the structures of 
foreign 
economic associations dealing with the export of arms, their 
leadership has been replaced, etc. 
  At the present time, the established system of 
military-technical cooperation is fully workable and basically 
fulfills the functions assigned to it, although it is not free 
from shortcomings (parallel efforts in individual areas of the 
work of foreign economic associations, bureaucracy, and a long 
time for the drawing up of contracts), which, in our view, can 
be eliminated through customary methods of everyday work. For 
this reason, the withdrawal of specialized foreign economic 
associations in a particular stage (as foreseen by Edict No. 
1932c of the President of the Russian Federation from 18 
November 1993) may lead to the disorganization of the program 
planned and approved by the Government of the Russian Federation 
for the reorganization of military-technical cooperation. Also 
unavoidable are the following negative consequences: 
  1. The receipt by foreign partners and arms customers of 
information about the fundamental reorganization of the 
All-Union association "Oboroneksport," the state foreign 
economic company "Spetsvneshtekhnika," and the GUSK, which have 
many years of experience in international weapons markets, will 
doubtless lead to increased uncertainty among them about the 
stability and possibility of Russia to fulfill its obligations 
in the area of military-technical cooperation. This threatens 
the conclusion of a number of new contracts and the incipient 
positive trends in the development of military-technical 
cooperation. The losses in connection with the cancellation of 
contracts are estimated at about $2 billion. 
  2. The establishment of the state company "Rosvooruzheniye" 
means the actual transfer of the state monopoly for trade in 
weapons to an economic entity, which violates the integrity of 
the work being carried out by the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations to pay off the debts of foreign countries to Russia 
and to eliminate the state debt of Russia to suppliers of arms 
and military equipment. 
  3. The establishment of the new structure in the system of 
military-technical cooperation will disrupt the organized 
utilization of a single infrastructure for the foreign economic 
activity of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, 
including foreign representations (trade delegations), through 
which most military-technical cooperation with foreign countries 
is carried out today. 
  The edict of the President of the Russian Federation from 18 
November 1993 was not coordinated with the departments 
responsible for the status of military-technical cooperation. It 
appears that actions for its realization are in need of serious 
coordination on the part of interested organizations. 
  In connection with what has been stated above, we ask you to 
suspend temporarily the effect of the edict and to entrust the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation 
with the preparation of proposals in relation to its realization. 
  B. Bunkin, general designer of the scientific-production 
association "Almaz," 
  V. Yefremov, general designer of the concern "Antey," 
  G. Yefremov, general designer of the scientific-production 
association for machine building, 
  Yu. Perunov, general designer of the Scientific-Production 
Association imeni P.S. Ploshakov, 
  V. Kireyev, general designer and general director of the 
Novocherkassk Engineering-Reclamation Institute, 
  M. Simonov, general designer of the Experimental-Design 
Bureau imeni Sukhoy, 
  A. Kuznetsov, general designer of the MAK "Vympel." 
  This letter and the material published on page 2 were 
prepared for printing on the eve of the first meeting of the 
Federal Assembly. We decided to put off its publication only so 
that we would not exercise even indirect influence on the 
results of the election of the speaker of the Council of the 
Federation--the figure of V. Shumeyko was already looming behind 
the scenes of this political drama. 
  The Russian senators have now made their choice and V. 
Shumeyko is now beyond the reach of justice. 
  But the trade in Russian weapons is a magnitude 
immeasurably greater both economically and politically. In our 
view, the documents that RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA is publishing today 
must attract the close attention of parliamentarians and perhaps 
a parliamentary investigation will be required. After all, the 
powerful main designers of Russian weapons, whose letter to the 
president we are publishing simultaneously, actually did not 
accomplish anything, although they raised the same questions to 
the highest state authority that are contained in the 
publication of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. 
  In refraining from the publication of this material on 
the eve of the elections for the Council of the Federation, we 
actually contributed to some degree to the election of V. 
Shumeyko to the highest post in the legislative structure of 
authority. While congratulating him on this success, we would 
also like to say that the repression to which RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA 
has been subject until now emanated and continues to emanate 
from the closest circle around the president, to which V. 
Shumeyko also belongs. At times this repression has the nature 
of petty revenge. They either shut down RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA or 
"punish" it in some other way for criticizing the scandalous 
"settlements" in the highest echelons of power, which attained 
the character of permanence and are diverting the strength of 
officials away from affairs that have now reached a deplorable 
state. For example, they cut off the telephones for government 
communications, as happened in October and continues to happen 
to this day, although the editor's office pays very well for 
this kind of service. As they say, the poor are very inventive 
and those in power are crafty in their repression, although 
prudence is very much preferable today.

<F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Kryukov: "Guns Backing Up to the Market: </F>
Who Benefits From the Reorganization of Arms Exports in Russia"] 
  [Text] Not all of what is stated below can be 
attributed to the adventure genre, nevertheless the past and 
subsequent events may serve as a good basis for the writing of a 
very "intense" detective story. I will begin my story on a by no 
means noteworthy date--10 September 1993.... 
  Precisely on this date at about 10 in the morning, three 
uninvited citizens entered the office of Maj-Gen Valeriy 
Braylovskiy of the State Foreign Trade Company [GVK], 
"Spetsvneshtekhnik" [SVT] of whom he remembered only one very 
well--V. Goncharov, senior justice adviser and investigator of 
especially important matters under the Procurator General of the 
Russian Federation. This visit ended with the forced 
transmission of several documents of a very delicate nature and 
the formulation of an official paper with the following content: 
  Protocol of a seizure [of documents]. 
  Moscow, 10 September 1993. 
  The investigator of especially important matters under 
the Procurator General of the Russian Federation, senior justice 
adviser Goncharov, with the participation of witnesses....seized 
documents confirming the transfer of $2.5 million to the firm 
"Telamon Ltd." in Switzerland. 
  The seizure began at 1015 and ended at 1110. 
  The documents shown by V.G. Brayloskiy were turned over 
voluntarily. 
  The following documents were confiscated for inclusion 
in the case: 
  1. A contract (agreement) between the GVK 
"Spetsvneshtekhnika" and the firm "Petromex Commodities Ltd" on 
the redemption of 50 percent of the shares of the firm "Artan 
Ltd.", No. 287 (25)93 from 4 March 1993 on two pages.... 
  3. Agreement No. 25 on intentions from 1 March 
1993; 
  4. A letter from 4 August 1992 No. 3-171 on the 
transfer of $2.5 million on one page; 
  5. Letter No. 01-T-19 to the firm "Telamon Ltd." from 
"Petromex Commodities Ltd." on one page; 
  6. The letter of the GVK "Spetsvneshtekhnika" from the 
firm "Petromex Commodities Ltd." on the transfer of $2.5 million 
to the firm; 
  The letter of the firm "Telamon Ltd." to "Seabeco 
Group" on the recript of $2.5 million from the GVK 
"Spetsvneshtekhnika" on one page.... 
  V.G. Brailovskiy, president of the GVK 
"Spetsvneshhtekhnika," made the following statement: "The GVK 
'Spetsvneshtekhnika' informs the representative of the 
Procurator General comrade Goncharov of the confidentiality of 
the information contained in the confiscated documents and takes 
no responsibility for the subsequent divulgence of information 
set forth in these documents...." 
  As a matter of fact, Valeriy Georgiyevich Braylovskiy had no 
interest in divulging the details of this deal, because to begin 
with the company of Mr. Leybovich "Petromex Commodities Ltd." 
that belongs to the holding group "Seabeco" used money belonging 
to "SVT" to cover its debt to the company "Telamon Ltd." 
  It may be that the Procurator General will answer the 
questions of what later happened to this $2.5 million and how it 
benefited the business people there as well as other questions. 
  In general, it it not so important what financial jungles 
our 
businessmen got into from the arms business. Something else is 
of interest: Who put through this dubious undertaking and how, 
with what advantage for himself? As for the person of the 
initiator or most active participant in the adventure, 
knowledgeable people name Dmitriy Yakubovskiy, the legendary 
witness of the infamous Interdepartmental Commission Against 
Corruption. 
  The confidentiality of the information, about which the 
president of "SVT" was so insistent, also involved something 
else: Vladimir Shumeyko, first vice-premier of the Government of 
Russia, took part in the story about the "Seabeco Group." 
  I quote one curious document from 16 March 1993 (style and 
spelling retained): 
  To First Deputy Chairman of the Government of the 
Russian Federation V.F. Shumeyko. 
  Esteemed Vladimir Filippovich. 
  At the present time, our organization faces 
qualitatively new tasks in the export and import of arms and 
military equipment to foreign countries, including the countries 
of Western Europe. 
  The solution to this task foresees the displacement of 
traditional suppliers from new markets, which forces us to apply 
nonstandard methods such as action through third firms 
accompanied by deals in general-purpose output (metals, 
fertilizers, etc.). This is dictated by the complex 
foreign-policy situation in the world with respect to the export 
of arms in general and in the Russian Federation in 
particular. 
  For this purpose, we chose the holding company "Seabeco 
Group," Switzerland, which is presently carrying out a large 
volume of export-import operations involving general-purpose 
output from the territory of the former USSR. 
  In connection with what has been stated, I ask your 
consent to the establishment of a distributor network through 
the acquisition of 50 percent of the shares of one of the 
companies of the indicated holding for the sum of $5 million, 
attributing the expenditures (considering their productive 
nature) to overhead expenses for exports while reducing the 
compulsory sale of foreign exchange proceeds to the 
state.... 
  V.G. Brailovskiy, president of the GVK 
"Spetsvneshtekhnika." 
  Let us put aside the verbal camouflage such as "nonstandard 
methods" or "complex foreign-policy situation in the world and 
in the Russian Federation" (?!) and let us ask ourselves one 
very simple question: how did the GVK "SVT" benefit from the 
acquisition of shares and the establishment of a joint company 
in Zurich on the basis of the firm "Seabeco Group," which 
Leybovich, Brailovskiy and others had joined even before that (4 
March 1993). After all, initially by no means the main role was 
assigned to "Spetsvneshtekhnika" in this game--it could not 
control anything and the only use that it had from the shares 
that it acquired was the fact that they served as a kind of 
guarantee for the return of the loaned sum. At least that is how 
one can understand point three of the contract from 4 March 
1993: "The indicated sum of 5 (five) million U.S. dollars is 
compensated by the firm through the transfer to the company of 
50 percent of its (the firm's) profit obtained from the 
activities of the joint firm in the course of the time necessary 
for the compensation of the $5 million. 
  But whether the assistants of Vladimir Filippovich who first 
dealt with the question failed to see these reefs or whether 
some other considerations influenced the decision that he made, 
the first vice-premier was favorably disposed to the idea of the 
president of the GVK "SVT." Here is his resolution from 24 March 
1993: "Concur with the proposals of `Spetsvneshtekhnika.' 
Proceed as instructed and present proposals on execution." That 
was a very specific instruction but it was in violation of all 
the canons of administrative ethics--it by-passed the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations, which included 
"Spetsvneshtekhnika," and Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, who 
was supervising the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations at 
the time. Also unnoticed was the fact that juridically the deal 
had already been made and they are either substituting the first 
vice-premier or he is helping out someone else. 
  In this philanthropy (the sending of money to Switzerland), 
one can clearly see someone's enormous personal interest rather 
than noble intentions. What we have is deception of the state 
and also of domestic producers of weapons, to whom the "SVT" has 
long been in debt. 
  It seems that the destruction of the former system for the 
export and import of arms in accordance with the President's 
Edict No. 1932-c from 18 November 1993 will leave this question 
unanswered, for the established state company for the export and 
import of arms and military equipment ("Rosvoorusheniye") will 
hardly want to take on the responsibility for the previous 
obligations of specialized foreign economic organizations to 
Russian weapons manufacturers. And they number more than 4 
million people, of whom more than 800,000 work in science. It is 
70 Russian city-plants and entire regions such as Udmurtia and 
Perm, Nizhegorod, Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, and other oblasts. 
  It is very problematical whether the new structure can 
return 
to Russia the debts of foreign countries--and they amounted to 
$120 billion over the last few decades. Or whether it can pay 
off our debts to suppliers of arms and military equipment. In 
any case, the current minister of foreign economic relations 
does not see any prospects for the domestic arms business. Under 
his proposals, the volume of military-technical cooperation will 
decline. 
  The primary influence on this is the clearly the untimely 
structural reorganization of the export of weapons. Solid 
contracts for the sale and servicing of combat aircraft 
equipment, surface-to-air missile, tanks, and ships were 
endangered. They amounted to almost $2 billion. 
  Officials who know what is really behind the above-mentioned 
edict do not deny that it is above all a number of officials at 
the highest level of power who are interested in removing 
specialized foreign economic associations from the control of 
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. But precisely who 
are they? 
  To answer this, it is necessary to see who has been 
entrusted 
with the management of the new "Rosvooruzheniye." For this post, 
the President of the Russian Federation appointed Lt-Gen Viktor 
Samoylov, the foreign military adviser of Vladimir Shumeyko. 
Once an instructor at a military academy and later senior 
officer at the Main Directorate for Cadres of the Ministry of 
Defense of the USSR, he dealt with the reorganization of the 
armed forces in the Committee for the Preparation and 
Implementation of Military Reform. 
  It can be assumed that one of the first foreign trade 
operations of "Rosvooruzheniye" will be the attempt to free up 
the $4.3 for 4.666 million tonnes of aluminum from Kemerovo sold 
by "Oboroneksport" to the Belgian firm "R.D.I." in April 1993, 
money that is blocked in a special account of the Rotterdam 
District Court. The Belgian firm had once shown farsightedness 
in finding a job for the daughter of the future president of 
"Rosvooruzheniye." 
  "R.D.I.," being unable to fulfill its payment obligations 
under the contract and not wishing to lose the valuable 
strategic raw material delivered to it ("Oboroneksport" quickly 
resold the aluminum to the English from "Optmarr"), organized 
the attachment of the shipment. How it was able to do this can 
be seen from a latter of the deputy administrative head of 
Kemerovo Oblast to Oleg Davydov, first deputy minister for 
foreign economic relations (No 23-55/88 from 5 July 1993): 
  A difficult situation arose in Rotterdam because of the 
operational and active support given to the firm "R.D.I." by its 
influential friends in Russia.... One of the main documents 
influencing the decision of the court was information from the 
main administrative desk of the organization of the president of 
the Russian Federation sent to the firm "R.D.I." with Shumeyko's 
fax machine, putting in doubt the right of individual officials 
of the foreign economic association "Oboroneksport" to sign 
contract documents. 
  Just think who these "influential friends in Russia" are who 
have unhindered access to the fax machine of the second man in 
the government. 
  The person of the second individual in "Rosvooruzheniye," 
Sergey Oslikovskiy, is known only to specialists in the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations and "Oboroneksport," from where he 
was driven (sent to the disposition of the Ministry of Defense) 
on 24 November of last year for his independent attempt to take 
control of intermediary functions between "Oboroneksport" and 
the company "Terimon Industrial Establishment" in organizing the 
delivery of special goods from Russia, negotiations, the 
implementation of contracts, etc. Not without remuneration, of 
course, but for a commission of 20 percent. Here are some 
"strokes" from his business biography: 
  2 February 1993. An agent agreement and supplementary 
agreement were signed between the foreign economic association 
"Oboroneksport" and the firm "Terimon Industrial Establishment" 
for a period of 12 months with automatic extension. 
  From the preamble of the agent agreement: "The Russian 
state foreign economic association "Oboroneksport," 
...hereinafter called "Association," and...the company "Terimon 
Industrial Establishment" represented by Mr. S.N. Oslinovskiy, 
hereinafter called "Consultant," concluded the present 
agreement...." 
  Commission compensation will be remitted to the 
Consultant at one of the banks of his choice in accordance with 
a written instruction that the Consultant will send to the 
Association. These payments will be proportional to the payments 
received by the Association and will be made in the currency of 
the received payment.... 
  From the supplementary agreement: "The commission 
compensation due to the Consultant will be paid out in the 
course of 60 days from the date of the actual receipt of the 
corresponding payments in the account of the 
Association...." 
  From a letter from the managers of "Terimon Industrial 
Establishment" to the management of the foreign economic 
association "Oboroneksport": 
  "On 27 February of this year, S. Oslikovskiy left 
Geneva for Tripoli after holding a number of meetings there with 
people to whom it was declared that he represents S. Karasglanov 
(former manager of the foreign economic association 
"Oboroneksport"--the editor). At Dzherba Airport (Tunis), there 
was no car to take S.O. (Oslikovskiy--the editor) to Tripoli and 
he returned to Geneva on Monday, 1 March of this year. This fact 
says quite a lot about his specific possibilities. 
  "We would like to appeal to S.K. to remove S.O. from 
these matters in a way that is convenient for him so that he 
cannot have a negative influence on the course of events.... 
  "It is possible that S.K. understands that S.O. visited 
Libya with a proposal on the delivery of materials for the sum 
of about $50 million...." 
  Indeed, one could not find a better candidacy for the 
position of deputy manager of "Rosvooruzheniye." He is very 
enterprising. 
  I will not call the reorganization of the system for the 
export of weapons absurd. Only it is a pity that the president 
did not listen to the opinion of the main designers of arms, the 
directors of the largest defense enterprises, who tried to stop 
the process. Or did someone save this letter until the right 
moment? 
  Meanwhile, the domestic defense industry is in its last 
throes. If only it had the strength at least to rearm its own 
army.

<F P=106> [Igor Saltykov article: "Slave Laborers in the Defense </F>
Industry's Salt Mines"] 
  [Text] "So, we will have to fight on. It will have to be 
guerilla warfare." This is how Aleksey Shulunov, president of 
the League for Assisting Defense Enterprises, ended our 
nighttime conversation. It was published by PRAVDA 19 January. 
A month has passed. Reflections in the upper echelons are 
turning the defense industry and conversion into abandoned salt 
mines. Guerilla warfare is becoming slave labor. 
  The mass stoppage of defense enterprises has begun. As a 
sign of protest? No, Russia's armorers, in line with their 
centuries-old traditions of selfless service to the fatherland, 
are not contemplating a strike. It is just that the majority of 
production units have been rendered insolvent. 
  Certain high-ranking compatriots and foreign consultants 
suggest that this is the outcome of unwise moves in an 
over-hasty conversion process. But the old defense complex in 
its current form is no longer a military-industrial complex. 
Some 80 percent of its output is civilian. Moreover, in a 
number of sectors this output is capable of competing on the 
world market. 
  The point is, it seems, that it is not the actual 
enterprises 
which have been rendered insolvent but the state. When summing 
up the results of 1993, it was made clear that our government 
has a striking talent for tightfistedness. It has managed to 
run up debts to the defense sector amounting not to the 700 
billion rubles [R] mentioned previously, but to R1.5 trillion. 
And given that the matter has not gone as far as the courts 
(the Prosecutor's Office has enough riddles from the past to 
solve), there is no hurry to advance state defense orders for 
1994, or, more especially, to release credits for conversion 
projects. 
  Moreover, in this year's budget submitted by the Ministry of 
Finance, allocations for national defense needs continue to be 
pared to a minimum. They have been reduced to 46 percent of 
last year's level. It should be noted that this calculation is 
not in dollars, but in rubles. When converted into world 
currency, it will amount in all to just 10 percent of last 
years's state expenditure. 
  Unlike the fledgling entrepreneurs, armaments workers can do 
their sums with the utmost accuracy. Otherwise Russia would not 
still be in possession of advanced military hardware. So it is 
that by their estimation -- which is apt and unbiased -- all 
these things signify the total destruction of the country's 
defense complex. Savings in this sphere have already surpassed 
what is feasible: The average wage in Russia last year was 
R58,400, while defense sector workers earned just R28,400. And 
although they grumbled, they remained patient, understanding 
that pre-market battles are being waged. But now, in just three 
or four months, around 20 million people will find themselves 
completely bereft of the means to survive. 
  The consequences of this type of social explosion are 
unpredictable. Especially as it is not clear where the 
government will find trillions of rubles to meet the costs of 
driving this mass of the most highly skilled workers, designers, 
and technicians into unemployment. Or has the government 
drafted decrees to defer all this as state debts over the next 
five years or so? 
  The conversion of defense enterprises is becoming 
nonsensical. Taxes, price deregulation, interest rates for bank 
credits, duties, and other government deductions reduce the 
capacity of the domestic market and artificially generate a 
sales crisis. The living standards of 90 percent of the 
population and people's purchasing power are at the lowest 
possible level. When fighting for survival, who needs household 
gadgets, crockery, television sets, motorcycles, bicycles, 
sewing machines, and so on and so forth? 
  Efforts to survive at the expense of the export of military 
hardware and arms have come to nothing. Moreover, the matter no 
longer concerns the sale of the latest weapons, but annual 
assistance in the safe operation of nationally produced combat 
hardware purchased not so long ago by the countries of Asia and 
Africa, and being used with relish by the states of Europe. 
Russia could earn around $5 billion for the prompt supply of 
spare parts alone. 
  Furthermore, many of these armaments are in need of 
upgrading. For instance, it is time to reequip combat aircraft 
with the latest missiles and more accurate weapon sights. 
However, according to information received, the Israelis and 
the British are already mounting French and U.S. missiles onto 
our MiG-21's. Whereas copyright dictates that Russian missiles 
be used. But our government's inconsistency in military trade 
forces foreign consumers to disregard Russian rights. 
  The result is depressing. Last year, the value of sales for 
routine repair work, and exports of consumables and spare parts 
was just $2.2 billion, instead of $5 billion. Meanwhile, the 
impact of last fall's decision to set up the new 
"Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, which is subordinate not to the 
Defense Ministry, nor to the State Committee for the Defense 
Industry, and not even to the government head, but to the 
President, was felt. And what came of this was not state 
discretion, but utter confusion which goes above and beyond 
secrecy. 
  The League for Assisting Defense Enterprises deemed it 
necessary to discuss ways of implementing the laws proclaimed by 
the Constitution. At the beginning of February it convened an 
enlarged session of its presidium. This involved leaders of the 
League's regional branches from Moscow, Nizhnyy Novgorod, Tula, 
Rostov-na-Donu, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Saratov. And the 
directors of the largest enterprises from Moscow and Bryansk 
regions. There was even an envoy from St. Petersburg, even 
though it is still undecided there whether to join the league or 
operate autonomously. First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin traveled to the conference, as did Yuriy Glybin and 
Gennadiy Yampolskiy, deputy chairmen of the State Committee for 
the Military Industry; Security Council Commission Chairman 
Mikhail Maley; and even Viktor Samoylov, manager of the newborn 
"Rosvooruzheniye." There were almost 60 of the most 
authoritative and knowledgeable slave laborers of Russia's 
defense industry. 
  Journalists, unfortunately, did not have the chance to 
attend 
the conference. However, according to the testimony of visiting 
participants, who did not touch upon secret matters, the 
industrialists themselves were able to exchange all the details 
of their enterprises' impending period of slave labor. They 
coincided absolutely. And they outlined the formidable impasse 
of the world's largest industry. Then they demanded 
explanations: After all, Premier Chernomyrdin gave instructions 
that last year's state debts should be repaid by 1 February. 
But so far not a single ruble, not even a defunct kopek, has 
been forthcoming. 
  Andrey Kokoshin admitted that absolutely nothing was paid 
out 
in January. But the Defense Ministry will pay off at least 60 
percent of its debts in the first quarter. Payments will start 
as of 10 February. At the same time he announced that he 
intends to petition the government to increase budget 
expenditure on defense. But whichever way you look at it, there 
are as yet no guarantees. 
  Viktor Samoylov for his part brushed aside the urgency of 
the 
need to supply spare parts abroad and service our military 
hardware sold there. He stressed that it is not worth 
discussing this yet, as it is a very complex question. 
  Yuriy Glybin noted that many problems have accumulated, but 
that it is necessary to concentrate on one: The oddities of the 
budget proposed by the Ministry of Finances. 
  Finally, Mikhail Maleyev revealed that the Security Council 
has in fact examined the requests, demands, and proposals 
submitted by defense enterprises back in November. And in the 
course of just two hours, everything was resolved successfully. 
The president confirmed his council's decisions. But although 
the instructions issued under these decision were addressed to 
specific individuals, nobody is in any hurry to act upon them, 
and some have no intention of carrying them out. The time might 
be ripe if not to start legal proceedings, then at least to 
apply some form of punishment.... 
  The results? There are none as yet. A letter was sent to 
Government First Deputy Chairman Oleg Soskovets on behalf of the 
league 14 February. It stressed: "We earnestly request that 
you take all measures within your power...to support the 
prioritypsectors of the country's economy. We consider it 
essential that the funds allocated to defense needs in 1994 
should exceed the level of planned allocations for 1993 in 
comparable prices by a factor of 1.3 at the very least." It was 
signed by the chief designers of nine of the largest science and 
production complexes and associations, including "MiG," "Antey," 
the A.A. Tupolev Aviation Science and Technology Complex, the 
"Sukhoy Experimental Design Bureau," and others. 
  Oleg Nikolayevich showed an interest. A meeting was set for 
16 February. But it did not take place. Soskovets was occupied 
with urgent matters until late into the evening. A new week 
began. Will something happen today, or tomorrow?... 
  Admittedly, the hope remains that after the President's 
message to parliament opening the discussion by the People's 
Deputies of the budget for this year, the chance will emerge to 
take account of the league's appeal, which was handed over to 
State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin. 
  People, while you stll have your senses, save your 
fatherland. Do not repeat the experience of Slovakia.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Rukina, deputy in the Moscow City Duma, </F>
under the rubric "Point of View": "Bankruptcy Is Too Harsh a 
Measure"] 
  [Text] We waited a long time for the appearance of a 
military doctrine, linking to it the solution to many problems 
of the defense industry. Now the basic principles of the 
doctrine have been approved, but this has not removed any of the 
defense industry's concerns. And it will hardly provide any 
relief until priorities are defined for the development of 
enterprises of the defense complex, a state policy toward these 
enterprises is formed and an appropriate legal situation is 
established. 
  What do I consider especially important in this area? First 
of all, there must be a flexible approach to the defense NII 
[scientific research institutes], KB [design offices] and 
plants. Some of them must unquestionably remain state, or 
"public," entities, while the rest must be told unequivocally 
that they are now "free" and have the authority to decide on 
their own how they want to continue to operate. 
  The designation "public" certainly does not mean any 
constriction of rights, however. On the contrary, they should be 
given as much independence as possible, even to the point of 
allowing them to act as responsible state clients. That is, not 
just the right to fill state orders but also to develop and 
establish a program for the production, sale and servicing of 
this or that combat equipment or weapon system. 
  If the enterprises are to act as a state clients, this will 
require that they set up an entire infrastructure around 
themselves for development, research, production, servicing and 
operation, the training of specialists, and so forth. In short, 
for the functioning of an entire area of the defense industry. 
These will be fairly efficacious structures. Take the Moscow 
Aviation Production Association, for example. During the past 
year and a half it has succeeded to some degree in setting up 
such a structure. It has learned how to set up new relations 
with its subcontractors, learned how not just to turn out 
products but how to sell them, and offered new approaches to the 
servicing of its products. Despite economic and financial 
difficulties, last year the association invested more than a 
billion rubles in science and as far as possible supported the 
design offices of its main subcontractors. Thanks in great part 
to this approach the enterprises retained its cooperative ties, 
its personnel and its capacity for producing extremely complex 
aviation systems. And this was despite the fact that it actually 
received no financing. 
  Prominent economists and politicians of ours assert that a 
market economy presupposes certain bankruptcy for many 
enterprises and, they say, this should be regarded as something 
necessary. The budget today is indeed so small that it cannot 
lift up the entire defense industry. But does this mean that the 
process should be left to take its own course? 
  We can and should point out that most of the enterprises 
have 
survived. There is no need to invest funds in and attempt to 
revive clearly unprofitable enterprises. We need to help the 
thriving, strong firms, but with the stipulation that they 
assume patronage over those which will not be able to survive on 
their own. 
  For what reason should a thriving enterprise concern itself 
with a clearly unprofitable one, you will ask. And are there any 
thriving enterprises today? There are. I am not certain that 
they are known, to be sure. There is a universal cry, after all, 
that everyone today is engaged in commerce and no one is 
producing anything. Things are being produced. The fact that 
these producers are frequently stuck in rented space, do not 
have their own funds and bear an enormous tax burden is another 
matter. 
  It is very important today to find people in a firm who have 
actually demonstrated that it is profitable to produce things. I 
have no doubt that others will follow in their footsteps. Only 
he who has made an enterprise profitable can teach others 
rapidly how to do so. 
  If we want to revive Russia's economy, we should not 
anticipate large-scale bankruptcies--that is too harsh a 
measure--but orient ourselves toward the producer. This will not 
require much: Just to make the tax system not a hindrance but a 
production regulator. One approach should be taken to the 
producers, another to the commercial structures. That does not 
mean that the commercial structures should be pressured. It is 
perhaps no less important today to learn civilized trade than to 
learn civilized production. In order to develop trade, however, 
we must have goods. The producer must therefore still be in the 
front. 
  The second problem which must be solved is that of improving 
the banking system. The banks today are actually over industry. 
Nowhere else in the world are people living with loan rates like 
ours, more than 200 percent. If the situation does reach the 
point of large-scale bankruptcies, the banks will find 
themselves the owners of those very unprofitable enterprises. 
Will they be capable of running them? I doubt it. It will most 
likely result in the collapse of the Russian economy, and we 
will have to go through the process of industrializing the 
nation once again. 
  I am certainly not calling for state regulation of the 
economy. If we begin regulating prices, that will be the end of 
the market economy, since regulation is the jurisdiction of 
officials, and we already have more than enough of them. When I 
began studying marketing, I liked very much the principle of 
producing what is advantageous to the consumer and not producing 
what is not. What could be more simple? In Russia's situation, 
however, it has assumed some absolutely terrible forms. 
  Essentially only two things are required of the state to 
make 
production advantageous. I would put in first place the 
principle: Do not interfere and do not do any harm. The second 
thing would be to set up a legal playing field in which all of 
the rules of the game are precisely defined. If we do not help 
ourselves, no one else is going to do so. And something has to 
be done rapidly. Rapidly and correctly. Otherwise, we risk 
losing the defense complex as such. Without creating anything to 
take its place.

<H5>  Who Will Gain if a Unique Subunit Falls Apart? </H5>
  The special subunit Vympel was set up under the First Main 
Directorate of the KGB [State Security Committee] to "perform 
missions for a particular period." The subunit is manned by 
officers with a higher education and fluent in foreign languages. 
  Vympel's ordeals began with the Union's disintegration, 
going 
from one department to another more than once. It is now being 
prepared be placed under the wing of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, which is generally a logical thing. The unique skills 
of the Vympel associates will come in very handy in combatting 
organized crime. 
  There is talk, however, that a national guard for Russia 
will 
be created out of the subunit. A worthwhile prospect, you will 
agree. The catch is that it has never been explained sensibly to 
the Vympel associates just what functions the special subunit 
will fulfill in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. As a 
result there is total uncertainty. According to preliminary 
reports, more than 100 of the Vympel staff have already 
submitted requests for discharge. What is the forecast? It is 
even less comforting. As many as 80 percent of the associates 
could leave, in which case there would be only memories of 
Vympel, a school of unique combat skills set up and carefully 
safeguarded for many years. The professionals estimate that it 
would take at least 10 years to resurrect the special subunit.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Text] The formation of a new type of 
relations--nonconfrontational, 
democratic, partnership relations--among states is one of the 
main distinguishing features of world development following the 
end of the almost half-century "cold war." This process is 
complex, many-sided and contradictory, but its chief vector 
becomes more and more obvious: it is toward interworking, 
coordination and unification of efforts and toward integration 
and cooperation. 
  This also applies fully to the military-political area. 
There 
is a profound dialectical link among national, regional and 
global security that is clearly confirmed by today's political 
realities. The threat of global nuclear war has been 
substantially diminished and put aside. The world unquestionably 
gained from this, but has it been delivered from military 
danger? Unfortunately not. Regional confrontation came to 
replace global confrontation. There has been a sharp increase in 
the number of crises, local wars and armed conflicts. Their 
number exceeds 60 today, and Europe takes first place in the 
proportion of conflicts in overall statistics. But the fact is, 
just a few years ago there was not one armed conflict here. 
  Such was the natural harvest resulting from planting of a 
sovereignization raised to the absolute and often acquiring the 
form of nationalism. If one turns to contemporary Europe, for 
example, it is impossible not to see that European integration 
has slowed seriously. The European community (as well as the 
entire world community, by the way) encountered new sources of 
tension and ended up facing the real danger of slipping down to 
a catastrophe which has fully discernible features. 
  It is war in Yugoslavia, into which an ever growing number 
of 
states is being drawn in one way or another. 
  It is enormous arsenals of weapons, including nuclear 
weapons, whose nonproliferation is becoming an ever greater and 
ever more troubling question. 
  It is instability in new independent states of Eastern and 
Central Europe, stricken by protracted economic crisis. 
  It is centers of conflict which have a tendency to escalate 
in various areas of the former USSR, both in CIS states as well 
as near their borders. 
  It is the attempts by certain states to satisfy their 
political ambitions in one way or another by filling the power 
vacuum formed in northern Eurasia as a result of disintegration 
of the USSR, and it is much more. 
  A situation has taken shape in which national interests of 
many states turn out to be affected throughout the spectrum of 
mutual relations, including interests of security and stability. 
And a civilized solution to it is possible only on the path of a 
joint, coordinated political solution to vital 
problems, both those inherited from the past as well as those 
newly arisen, i.e., on the path of consolidation based on trust, 
mutual understanding, equality and civilized partnership. 
  All states must be included in this choice. Selecting them 
according to the principle of political conjuncture or, even 
worse, according to "cold war" cliches and stereotypes is 
dangerously short-sighted. 
  Of course, directing attention only to the remaining "power 
structures" of NATO or the Western European Union [WEU] and 
relying on other similar organizations of western states can 
lead to certain, albeit temporary, progress. On the whole, 
however, that approach is incapable of solving the problem of 
forming a new model of a safe, stable world. Moreover, excluding 
new independent states from the integration process and 
isolating either some of them or particular groups of states and 
arbitrarily narrowing the military-strategic "security space" is 
capable of leading to the mothballing and subsequent 
reproduction of potential sources of tension and instability in 
a certain situation. 
  In other words, under contemporary conditions collective 
security becomes not simply a demand of life, but also a kind of 
international obligation which states voluntarily assume for the 
sake of their own interests and universal peace. And if we are 
speaking about Russia and other CIS member states, the chief 
guarantee of national security of each Commonwealth state 
individually and of all of them together specifically is an 
effective system of their collective security coupled integrally 
with the European and world systems. In addition, cemented by 
Russia and covered by its "nuclear umbrella," such a system can 
and must be that very Eurasian power center which acts as a very 
important guarantor of balance and stability of the regional and 
worldwide security space. 
  Ways of establishing such a system were outlined in the CIS 
Charter, the Tashkent Collective Security Treaty, the concept of 
military security of Commonwealth member states, and other 
military-political documents adopted in the CIS. Naturally, all 
activity in the military-political area depends directly on 
interfacing the economic and financial structures of CIS states 
and on the formation and strengthening of their economic 
alliance. The political will to establish such an alliance is 
becoming more and more pronounced in the majority of 
Commonwealth states. Formation of the Commonwealth 
Coordination-Consultative Committee and Executive Secretariat 
substantially strengthens national economic ties. 
  It is understandable that the CIS collective security system 
can be effective only if it is based not on declarations, but on 
real involvement of independent states in its 
functioning. 
  This is why joint development of the mechanism for 
implementing the Collective Security Treaty of CIS member states 
and their taking specific, coordinated steps to materialize the 
sum total of military-political agreements in the Commonwealth 
are fundamentally important. Figuratively speaking, the 
principal "gears" of such a mechanism are the interstate bodies 
for coordination and interworking and the armed forces of 
independent Commonwealth states. The work of forming general 
approaches to the creation and coordinated functioning of such 
"gears" demands self-restraint, patience, political 
responsibility and farsightedness. The military-technical 
cooperation of Commonwealth states and continuance or 
restoration of cooperative ties in the defense industry on a 
qualitatively new basis, possibly with establishment of 
interstate corporations for arms and military equipment 
production in the CIS, are of special, basic importance for 
successful organizational development of national armed forces 
and for military-political integration on the whole. 
  Along with this "external" function, conditionally speaking, 
the CIS collective security system also has an "internal" 
function. A number of major conflicts are permanently developing 
in geographic space of the former USSR: in the Transcaucasus, 
North Caucasus, Dniester region, and Central Asia. The 
appearance of new centers in other areas is possible. 
  Paramilitary bandit forces, "army surrogates," criminal 
clans, criminal groups, and outside military assistance all are 
factors currently in force that threaten the national security 
of Commonwealth countries. CIS states cannot be allowed to 
become hostages of "small wars," international terrorism, armed 
subversion and crime, and along with this a source of European 
and world instability. 
  A new generation of people brought up on the smell of 
powder, 
on blood, and on the blind, dangerous delusion that only the 
language of force is capable of resolving all conflicts is 
beginning to form on this soil. In recent years armed units for 
which war becomes the source of life appeared in many regions. 
  An analysis of modern armed conflicts and their sources, 
course and outcome shows that there is not nor can there be a 
reasonable alternative to their world political settlement. Take 
the Abkhazian-Georgian conflict for example. If we imagine that 
Georgia will win a military victory in this conflict, then 
representatives of Russia's mountain-dwelling peoples and Abkhaz 
volunteers from Turkey will come to Abkhazia's help, and this 
signifies an escalation of the conflict and the drawing of new 
states and peoples into it with obvious consequences for 
regional and universal peace. But if Abkhazia wins a military 
victory, then Georgia will turn to other states for military 
assistance, and such states will be found. Consequently, there 
is again an escalation of the conflict and its development into 
war, and again blood, tears, sufferings and destruction. 
  Unfortunately, there are forces not only within but also 
outside the CIS which are not interested in localizing and 
stopping these conflicts and which are pushing peoples of the 
CIS toward disintegration and a redivision of territory and 
property, which means toward confrontation, internal 
militarization, exhaustion of resources and inevitable collapse. 
  Such logic contradicts common sense and the vital interests 
of peoples. 
  It seems to me that our time must give birth to politicians 
of the future whose distinguishing features would be their 
ability to solve all problems by peaceful means, naturally, 
without detriment to the interests of their own state and their 
own people, since even the most brilliant victory in war is 
nothing compared with victory in the struggle to bar 
and prevent war. 
  The formation and consistent implementation of a coordinated 
peacemaking policy within the framework of Commonwealth 
collective security are becoming increasingly urgent in view of 
the fact that conflicts on CIS territory are becoming protracted 
and insistently demand development of a joint policy, including 
a prophylactic, "preventive" policy for preventing them and for 
restoring and keeping the peace. Only Russia is fully involved 
in the sphere of peacemaking policy for now, and in the process 
it is suffering not only material costs, but also moral and 
political losses difficult to recoup from 
accusations--absolutely unfair and often simply speculative and 
provocative--of "imperial" intentions and objectives. This is 
why the need for active involvement of all states parties to the 
Collective Security Treaty in preventing and stopping crises and 
conflicts arising on the territory or borders of CIS states 
becomes more and more urgent. The need for forming contingents 
of peacemaking forces on a multinational basis so that subunits 
of armies of all member states operate in them under CIS mandate 
is no less obvious. 
  And in view of the specific historical character and 
traditions of peoples living here, it is possible to use 
collective peacemaking forces exclusively of the Commonwealth 
for peacemaking operations in the CIS geostrategic space--of 
course, under the procedure specified by the UN Charter and with 
notification of the United Nations. 
  It is impossible not to see that NATO is using its armed 
forces as peacemaking forces more and more often in striving to 
become the guarantor of world stability. In this connection it 
appears fundamentally important that neither NATO nor any other 
military-political blocs perform peacemaking missions, but 
specifically UN troops, of which military contingents of CIS 
states already are a part. To this end it is necessary to 
strengthen the UN military structure and grant it the right to 
organize and coordinate the training of troops assigned to 
international peacemaking forces and to accomplish their unified 
outfitting and support. 
  An extremely important military-political aspect of the 
dialectics of national and collective security of Commonwealth 
states involves the strategic nuclear forces inherited from the 
USSR. The specific nature of the situation is that these forces 
unquestionably must have state affiliation. There is no doubt at 
all that such state affiliation can and must be only Russian, 
inasmuch as it is Russia that is the sole successor to the 
USSR's nuclear status and to the nuclear missile component of 
its Armed Forces. 
  Punctual fulfillment of the START I Treaty and Lisbon 
Protocol, which already have been ratified by all states parties 
with the exception of Ukraine, is a fundamental condition for 
ensuring security not only in the Commonwealth, but also in 
Europe and throughout the world as well. The perpetuation and 
strengthening of such cornerstones of contemporary peace and 
universal security as nonproliferation of nuclear and other 
kinds of mass destruction weapons are connected with this in 
particular. 
  The future transition of Commonwealth countries to be under 
Russia's "nuclear umbrella" is a guarantee of regional and 
worldwide stability and of reliability and effectiveness in 
ensuring their national security. 
  All experience of mankind's history and the struggle for 
social progress, security and peace bear witness that peoples' 
unity, interworking and cooperation in resolving problems that 
arise are in their interests. Further deepening of reforms on 
the path to democracy and a rule-of-law state directly depends 
on unification of states' efforts in joint work of maintaining 
security and peace. 
  The future belongs to ever deeper, more comprehensive 
integration based on equality, mutual understanding, trust and 
good-neighbor relations.

<H5>  Part 1 - Defense and Security in the Contemporary World </H5>
  Abrupt changes in contemporary international relations, 
spasmodic development of events, and the appearance of trends 
impossible to foresee in the recent past all indicate that human 
civilization is at a critical stage in its evolution. The world 
system which formed after the end of World War II is giving way 
to a new configuration of international relations. 
  Are the role and importance of defense and assurance of 
security changing in the new situation? What is advantageous for 
states--separate actions in the security area or a search for 
ways to unite efforts and integrate actions? Should CIS members 
be oriented toward independence in the defense area or follow a 
path of cooperation in the military area in their interests? 
These questions can be answered only after a thorough analysis 
of factors determining the development of contemporary 
international relations and of military-political relations as a 
part of them. 
<H5>  1.1. Forming a New World Order </H5>
  In the 40 years since World War II the nature of relations 
among states was determined by the existence of two opposing 
systems headed by the USSR and United States, by the 
predominance of a confrontational nature in their mutual 
relations, and by each one's reliance above all on military 
force in policy with respect to each other. It is important to 
remember here not only the global East-West confrontation, but 
also the complex knot of North-South contradictions and the 
numerous regional contradictions which often developed into open 
conflicts. 
  On the whole, four groups of countries stood out from the 
standpoint of aggregate force capabilities for achieving their 
goals: superpowers which headed opposing blocs; great 
powers--permanent members of the UN Security Council--which 
influenced the world community; medium states capable of 
affecting the development of a situation in individual regions; 
and small countries which had an insignificant influence on 
international relations. 
  Ruling circles of states both of East as well as West 
perceived the world in the "cold war" period as follows: 

  -  ideological struggle of the two systems was viewed as a 
mortal clash until total destruction of the opposing side; 
  -  the United States and USSR as countries heading opposing 
systems realized that their territories were vulnerable to 
nuclear strikes which could be prevented only by following a 
deterrence policy; 
  -  ensuring viability of their allies and friendly regimes in 
various regions of the world was considered a very important 
aspect of U.S. and USSR policy; 
  -  both sides viewed an armed conflict in Europe as the main 
military danger. 

    The world is entering a period of transition from 
confrontation of the bipolar "East-West" structure to new 
international relations and to a new global community, which 
open up great opportunities for constructive international 
cooperation and settlement of issues and conflicts by political 
means. 
  Rid of the constant presence of the threat of global nuclear 
catastrophe, the cardinally changing geopolitical picture of the 
world nevertheless still does not permit letting up attention to 
security problems. 
  Disintegration of the Warsaw Pact Organization and USSR and 
disappearance of the ideological watershed between East and West 
cardinally changed the disposition of forces which took shape in 
the "cold war" period and lent impetus to development of 
qualitatively new processes. The question of confrontation of 
polar systems, socialist and capitalist, concentrated around two 
superpowers, the USSR and United States, became a thing of the 
past. The process connected with rejection of total structures 
and restoration of normal market relationships essentially 
embraced the entire former system of socialism, although it is 
proceeding at a different rate and with great originality in 
each individual country. This process gave rise to deep-seated 
changes in a number of international structures which had formed 
and which had supported the East-West confrontation. Above all 
this was the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact Organization, 
already mentioned, and the withdrawal of Soviet Armed Forces 
from the territory of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and in 
the near future also Germany. Changes are occurring both in 
functions and structure of NATO in the direction of 
transformation from a military-political to a political-military 
organization. The numerical strength of armed forces of NATO 
countries stationed in the Central European theater is being 
reduced and U.S. military presence in various areas of the world 
is diminishing. 
  The very essence and political content of the "superpower" 
concept are undergoing modification. Historically it was 
associated with possession of nuclear weapons, unlimited 
economic capacities and claims to representing the model of 
mankind's future. Fifteen independent states formed in place of 
one of the superpowers, the USSR (Diagram 1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-005LC-05A>           Diagram 1. States which formed </FIG>





    Possessing mass destruction weapons as the successor to the 
USSR's nuclear status, Russia continues to be the only 
post-Soviet republic which could claim the role of superpower, 
but after a little over 70 years of building socialism, Russia 
rejected claims to the role of being a model of social order for 
all mankind. Russian society is being transformed into a 
socioeconomic system based on market relations and on a 
democratic state system. The crisis being experienced by Russia 
is of such depth and scale that it does not allow counting on 
obtaining sufficiently tangible socioeconomic results at the 
very least for the life of one generation. 
  With respect to the United States, it gradually finds itself 
in a situation where other countries are emerging from U.S. 
control more and more confidently and prefer to be guided in 
their affairs by their own national interests. In addition, the 
United States often simply cannot behave as a superpower because 
a number of countries have acquired economic capacities 
comparable with U.S. capacities, which makes U.S. advantages 
more and more relative. At the same time, while losing many of 
the attributes of a superpower, the United States obviously 
still will remain a world leader in all spheres--political, 
economic and military--for a long time. In the early 1990's U.S. 
gross national product [GNP] exceeded $5.5 billion, which is 15 
percent greater than the GNP's of Germany, France, Great Britain 
and Italy together and almost double the GNP of Japan. In the 
latter half of the 1980's U.S. GNP increased an average of 2.8 
percent annually in real terms with an inflation rate of 3.5 
percent. At the same time, productivity in the business sphere, 
including energy sectors and the private sector, grew by no more 
than 0.5 percent annually during the 1980's. 
  The gradual disappearance of superpowers from the political 
arena and their narrowing capabilities for balancing the world 
situation are accompanied by an expansion in the ranks of great 
powers. The capability of exerting global influence is building 
up for the latter above all because of economic capacities. In 
this connection the "economic weight" of states is acquiring 
great importance in global and regional terms. 
  Japan, whose economy is characterized by continuance of 
outstripping development rates compared with the United States 
and principal Western European countries, is moving to leading 
roles as an economic power center. Another distinguishing 
feature of the Japanese economy is the significantly lower 
inflation level compared with these countries. In the latter 
half of the 1980's the average annual growth rate of Japan's GNP 
was 4.2 percent, that of inflation was 1.8 percent, and business 
productivity grew an average of 3 percent per year in the 
1980's. This permits saying that Japan is catching up with the 
United States. 
  The influence of Germany is growing most among European 
countries, which to a considerable extent is connected with 
unification of the FRG and GDR as a single state. The GNP of 
unified Germany is around three-fourths of the aggregate GNP of 
France and Great Britain. The FRG's economic growth rates in 
real terms have averaged 3.2 percent annually since the 
mid-1980's, that of inflation 2.5 percent, and business 
productivity grew by 1.6 percent annually in this period. Entry 
into force of the Maastricht Agreements signed in December 1991 
will permit Germany to strengthen its position considerably not 
only in Western but also in Eastern Europe as well as in the 
world as a whole. 
  In the future, economic balance among the most influential 
countries in the world will change against a background of 
increasing "economic weight" of medium-rank countries, basically 
from among developing states. These are such countries as India, 
Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Argentina and a number of others. On the 
whole the absence of two opposing world systems forces a 
different look at developing countries: this no longer is a 
"third world" seeking its path between two global geopolitical 
blocs. 
  A reduced level of political confrontation from a global 
aspect does not mean such trends will predominate at a regional 
or local level. Experience already shows both a sharp 
intensification of conflict in relationships between individual 
countries as well as a growth in capabilities of small and 
medium states to influence the policy of great powers and the 
world situation. 
  Along with the positive phenomena and trends, fundamental 
changes in the picture of the contemporary world also called to 
life negative ones, above all of a nationalistic, disintegrative 
nature. The threat to the cause of security and peace that is 
coupled with them urgently demands barring the destructive 
development of events and ensuring a smooth, evolutionary 
transition of the international relations system that has formed 
to a qualitatively new state. 
  The solution to this problem presumes finding optimum ways 
to 
harmonize the process of changes. Far from last place among them 
is occupied by formation of a global security system and its 
component, a CIS collective security system. Such a system could 
provide each of its members greater capabilities compared with a 
situation in which any one country acted on an individual basis. 
As a result Commonwealth states would make their contribution 
toward overcoming consequences of the destruction of the balance 
of forces which existed in the world and toward ensuring 
international stability. 
<H5>  1.2. Intensification of Cultural-Ethnic Contradictions </H5>
  With discontinuance of global confrontation on a 
class-ideological basis along the East and West axis, the 
influence of cultural-ethnic contradictions and geopolitical, 
national and confessional problems connected with them on 
security both in the world as a whole as well as in individual 
regions sharply intensified. The sources of these contradictions 
lie in the fact that mankind consists of ethnic 
communities--cultural-historical formations having a common 
culture and occupying a certain geographic territory that often 
does not coincide with state boundaries. The culture of some 
ethnic communities, above all its political component reflecting 
the aggregate of views on goals and tasks and on relations with 
the surrounding world, can enter into contradiction with the 
culture of other communities and thereby generate tension. This 
can be compensated by a system of good-neighbor relations and 
not be manifested in any kind of extreme forms for decades. But 
a change in priorities, goals and tasks of development of ethnic 
communities can catalyze contradictions and destabilize the 
situation. 
  The most important processes from this standpoint are 
occurring in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, the 
Asiatic-Pacific region and a number of other countries and 
regions of the world. 
  During the more than 200 years of its existence the 
United States of America passed through several 
stages of development. The stage which began with the arrival of 
President F. Roosevelt in power presently is coming to a close. 
It was characterized by the consensus which formed in American 
society over the understanding that the primary danger to 
America threatened from outside. The Vietnam war undermined the 
American people's faith in the need to support the "global 
deterrence" policy being followed by the federal government, and 
disintegration of the USSR essentially nullified it. The shift 
of main attention to the country's domestic problems stands out 
more and more in relief for the United States. 
  On a socioeconomic plane, by the beginning of the 1990's 
ideas of conservatism which did not lead to a growth in American 
society's well-being when implemented by the Reagan and Bush 
administrations lost attractiveness both for the U.S. population 
as well as for a number of other countries. 
  U.S. national strategy following World War II was aimed at 
preserving and strengthening positions as the military, 
economic, political and ideological leader of the West in 
confrontation with the USSR above all. The change in the 
situation and the trend toward replacing a bipolar system of 
international relations with a multipolar system raises the 
question of choosing a new approach. A process of rethinking 
foreign policy priorities presently is going on in the United 
States. Two points capable of negatively affecting development 
of the international situation draw attention. 
  First of all, it is an assessment of results of the end of 
the "cold war" as a victory of the West, above all the United 
States. The conclusion is drawn that as a result the United 
States remains the only superpower and is predestined almost by 
fate itself to govern the world. Practical actions of the U.S. 
leadership in 1992 confirm that such a way of thinking has 
influential proponents; however, it appears that long-term and 
not conjunctural, momentary U.S. interests demand a weighed 
assessment that involves modern realities and prospects of 
global development under the new conditions. 
  Secondly, it is the attempts to reanimate an essentially 
colonialist approach to solving world problems. Advancement of 
the thesis of the advisability of creating a club of rich, 
civilized countries capable of "governing" mankind became a kind 
of reaction to the decreased capabilities in a multipolar 
structure of international relations for safeguarding interests 
of the United States and a number of states of Western Europe 
essentially at the expense of the rest of the world. Efforts to 
realize this thesis are capable of causing a split in the world 
community and an escalation of international tension. 
  These points possibly will not develop. This will ease the 
work of maintaining stability and creating an effective 
international security system, but even in the given instance 
evidently one should proceed from the fact that U.S. national 
strategy will be aimed at maximum preservation of predominant 
positions in the world. While giving more attention to economic 
well-being in the United States itself, the country's leadership 
will strive to use multilateral organizations such as NATO more 
actively in American interests. But under certain conditions 
such a direction of actions essentially can become close to or 
even similar to the idea of forming a club of rich states. 
  In Europe two differing cultural-historical 
communities--Western European and Eastern European--coexist. 
Their development is characterized by opposite trends. 
  A process of transition from an authoritarian 
political-economic system to a pluralistic system is occurring 
in Eastern Europe. Disintegration of the soviet-centrist system 
which existed in the region is breaking the stable structure of 
foreign-policy interaction of countries located here and giving 
it a transitional nature. This circumstance is superimposed on 
internal instability, which creates a field of potential 
conflict in the region. 
  The developing situation increases the possibility of 
frictions and conflicts, especially among countries with 
national-territorial claims (Albania-Yugoslavia, 
Greece-Bulgaria, Hungary-Yugoslavia, Hungary-Romania, 
Hungary-Slovakia, Bulgaria-Turkey, Bulgaria-Romania). 
  The course and outcome of the war in Yugoslavia are of 
special importance for prospects of Eastern Europe's 
development. The sequence of mutually generated national-state 
conflicts and attempts at recarving the European map strengthen 
fears of this region's "Balkanization." On the whole, the trend 
toward formation of national states in Eastern Europe was given 
powerful impetus and evidently will be determining for 
cultural-historical development for the foreseeable period. 
  The processes occurring in Western Europe contribute to 
creating a region unified in cultural-historical terms and to 
identifying the population as inhabitants of a unified 
continent. Development of the European Economic Community became 
the chief factor which led to this process in the last decade. 
  The Maastricht Agreements created a basis on which a unified 
European government can be formed and a common foreign and 
military policy developed. The presence of a European market 
will have a very strong effect on forms and methods of economic 
and other relationships of Western Europe with other regions of 
the world, since each country will be interested in the strong 
positions of other European countries. 
  Western European independence in the future presumes 
creation 
of its own security system and realization of its own military 
policy. Four interrelated directions are being used in this 
connection: 

  -  bilateral cooperation; 
  -  use of European Community [EC] bodies to deepen military 
integration; 
  -  strengthening of WEU influence in development of 
foreign and military policy; 
  -  use of NATO as a ready-made 
command structure. 

    The perceptible strengthening of ties between Paris and Bonn 
gives very strong impetus to Western European cooperation in the 
military area. The Franco-German initiative on deploying a joint 
corps in France based on the Franco-German brigade opens up the 
path to practical progress toward an independent European 
defense. 
  In the future, confrontation may grow stronger between 
proponents of a European and an Atlantic security model. 
Establishment of a European Community common market in 1993 and 
acceleration of Western European integration in all directions, 
total withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany in 1994 with a 
simultaneous significant reduction in U.S. military presence on 
the European continent, the reduction in numerical strength of 
NATO Armed Forces by the mid-1990's and the beginning of their 
restructuring, and the reduction in the number of nuclear 
weapons in Europe speak in favor of this. An increasingly 
independent military-political unification west of the borders 
of Commonwealth states may show up distinctly as a result. 
  The national strategy of Japan following World War 
II was dictated at first by the need to adapt to the status of a 
defeated country, and then by the desire to turn into an 
influential world power. 
  By the beginning of the 1990's Japan had become one of the 
most important industrial countries of the world. Processes 
evolved in Japanese society which may lead to a change in 
perception of the role of the Land of the Rising Sun in the 
world and to a corresponding adjustment of foreign policy goals 
and national security policy. 
  Japan's postwar military-political course is based on an 
alliance with the United States. For long years opposition to 
communism in the person of the USSR was its ideological basis. 
Today this basis is no more. Attaining the status of an economic 
power center permits Japan to build relations with the United 
States as an equal, which undermines the second prop of the 
American-Japanese military-political alliance--Japan's 
subordinate role in it. From a domestic political standpoint, 
Japan took advantage of the alliance with the United States to 
accomplish two interrelated tasks: unification of society in the 
face of a strong external opponent and mobilization of the 
country to "overcome an obstacle" in the form of the United 
States from an economic respect. On the whole the processes that 
are occurring can lead to strengthening of Japan's desire to act 
more independently in the world arena, above all in Asia. 
  The Japanese leadership presently continues to adhere to the 
concepts of "comprehensive assurance of national security" 
adopted in the early 1980's. In accordance with it, the 
country's national goals--"rich country, strong army," with 
present emphasis on the first part--are to be ensured with 
reliance on aggregate power and on both military as well as 
nonmilitary means. 
  Economic security holds a key place in the concept. It is 
understood to mean holding onto leading positions in the world 
economy by an increase in production efficiency, assurance of 
the use of high technology, a growth in competitiveness of 
Japanese commodities, and access to sales and raw materials 
markets, and also taking appropriate steps against undesirable 
changes in the world economic environment. An important place in 
the concept is set aside for political methods as an effective 
means of increasing its influence in the world. 
  Missions in the military area--"defending national 
territory, 
maintaining balance and stability in the Northwestern Pacific, 
safeguarding security of Japan's sea and ocean lines of 
communication"--are considered fulfillable by the Armed Forces 
with the existing numerical and effective combat strength. 
  In case foreign policy goals are revised and Japan moves 
away 
from the United States, it can begin to follow a more 
independent military-political course. In this case Japan's 
missions in the military area evidently also will be changed. 
This means security problems for CIS countries in the East also 
will take on new outlines. 
  The uniqueness of developing countries was 
determined throughout the "cold war" period by the fact that 
they were viewed as the "third world" both by great powers as 
well as by their own political elites, and being in the "third 
world" in the final account did not presume the existence of 
ethnoses with their cultural needs and areas of habitation. From 
an economic aspect it was a question about economic development 
under a "western" or "eastern" model, from a political aspect 
about a socialist or bourgeois system of society, and from an 
ideological aspect about the struggle of two ideologies. An 
alien way of thinking and an ideology created on the basis of a 
European culture often were imposed on peoples of developing 
countries. 
  Representatives of political elites of the developing 
countries themselves usually viewed their development in light 
of the European path and guided by an eclectic system of values, 
which promoted a growth of dependence on developed states. 
Therefore destruction of the bipolar structure of the world led 
to a loss of customary reference points by local leadership 
circles and at the same time to a perception of events occurring 
in the world as an opportunity for rapid resolution of old 
foreign-policy problems. 
  For CIS states, questions of security dictated by the 
cultural-historical formation of developing countries are linked 
above all with development of the situation south of 
Commonwealth borders in countries of Asia Minor and the Near and 
Middle East. The situation in this region is determined to a 
considerable extent by the strengthening influence of Islamic 
fundamentalism. Attempts are being made to realize ideas of 
spreading "true Islam" not only in the region, but also beyond 
and on this basis to create an alliance of Islamic states or a 
United States of Islam. Of course, accomplishment of these tasks 
by Islamic fundamentalists is being held up both by development 
of the domestic political situation in individual countries and 
by the state of relations among them. But one cannot deny the 
fact that realization of these plans would contribute to a 
growth of conflict in a vast region. 
  On the whole, a zone of relatively powerful states, states 
which are beginning a struggle to strengthen influence on world 
policy and which are ready to begin a new, unique repartition of 
the world, is forming south of the former USSR borders. 
  Militant nationalism is an aspect of the process of 
formation 
or disintegration of ethnic communities that is negative for 
international security and that is being most clearly manifested 
of late. The striving of peoples for self-determination, defense 
of their rights, and creation of a basis for national 
development is understandable. The desire to overcome injustice 
and consequences of infringements of their interests committed 
in the past is natural. At the same time, their attainment of 
full sovereignty essentially is impossible because the majority 
of these states are multi-ethnic. Ignoring this situation leads 
to the appearance of crises and armed conflicts which are 
capable of destabilizing the situation in the region and in the 
world. 
  Processes occurring on territory of the former 
USSR can influence the disposition and correlation of 
forces in the contemporary world to a deciding extent. It is 
important to note that historically two trends operated on the 
enormous expanse of Northern Eurasia: on the one hand, the 
desire to preserve national identity of individual peoples and, 
on the other hand, formation of a unified cultural-historical 
community for purposes of joint survival based on rejection of 
confrontation of some ethnoses with others, on coexistence, and 
on creation of a polyethnic community. Artificially imparting a 
violent nature to the second trend, especially in the last 
period of existence of the Russian Empire and USSR, blackened it 
in the peoples' eyes to a considerable extent. But the trend 
toward unification of peoples populating the enormous expanse 
from Brest to Vladivostok and from Murmansk to Kushka 
objectively is progressive in nature. 
  A desire for national self-assertion prevailed in the first 
year of CIS existence. This entailed painful problems of 
demarcation, division of property, and determination of 
boundaries. Of course, establishment of sovereignty of states on 
territory of the former USSR is irreversible, but this by no 
means contradicts these states' broadest integration in all 
areas and formation of a firm community of peoples on a new, 
democratic basis. 
  Geopolitical reality continues to be of great importance for 
unification of efforts of CIS peoples. The question of 
independent or subordinate development of the central part of 
the Euro-Asiatic continent was a very important question of 
world politics for many centuries. Peoples living here are 
between two world civilizations as it were--European (Christian) 
and Eastern (Islamic). Many generations of politicians both in 
the West as well as in the East proceeded from the importance of 
control over this space. It was believed since olden times that 
the one who possessed central Eurasia was capable of determining 
the political situation on the continent, and the one who 
controlled Eurasia ruled the entire world. 
  The emergence in the foreground of world policy of 
cultural-ethnic problems interrelated with geopolitical, 
national and confessional problems dictates the need for a close 
coupling of efforts to strengthen the independence of states 
which arose within boundaries of the former USSR and their 
integration in the defense and security area. 
<H5>  1.3. Growth of Economic Interdependence of States </H5>
  Signs of the new international relations structure which are 
showing up more and more distinctly confirm its very close tie 
with economics. The world economy essentially can be viewed as 
an integral system in which each country interacts with others 
based on common technical and economic principles of 
safeguarding, reproducing and shaping mankind's vital interests. 
Economic differences between parts of the world lie in the 
degree of development of commodity, job, capital and information 
markets, in the depth of division of labor within countries and 
the nature of their inclusion in the world market, and in the 
forms and quality of the population's social protection. This 
presumes the presence of an enormous diversity of countries from 
the standpoint of their level of socioeconomic development. 
  From the most general aspect the structure of the world 
economy can be pictured in the form of two parts: central and 
peripheral. The accumulation of achievements of the world 
economy characterizes the center and specialization in raw 
materials characterizes the periphery. Countries belonging to 
the central part possess an adjusted economic mechanism of 
self-development, while those belonging to the peripheral part 
have no such mechanism or it is rather weak. The limited nature 
of natural resources and presence of very acute ecologic, 
organizational, demographic and other problems does not allow 
all world countries to have a level of development comparable 
with the prosperity of western civilization. Therefore a 
division into developed and developing countries continues to be 
timely, although the boundary between them is gradually eroding. 
  The transition from a bipolar to a multipolar world 
structure 
in combination with a significant acceleration of processes of 
national-cultural formation and with a pluralization of national 
interests of different states, and as a result of this the 
transition to an increased likelihood of conflicts in their 
relations all have a growing effect on the nature of economic 
ties among countries. 
  A deepening of economic interdependence leads to creation of 
competing economic groupings which form around or on the basis 
of centers of world influence. 
  This process advanced farthest in Western Europe. Having 
begun at the borderline of the 1950's and 1960's, economic 
unification of Western Europe was accelerated considerably in 
the late 1980's and early 1990's. In connection with the actual 
merger with the Western European economic grouping second in 
importance, the European Free Trade Association [EFTA] (Austria, 
Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and 
Finland), plans presently are being implemented to expand the 
influence of the principal economic organization of Western 
Europe, the European (Economic) Community, to the entire 
continent right up to boundaries of the former Soviet Union. The 
addition of Turkey, Cyprus and Malta and subsequently Hungary, 
Poland, Czechia and Slovakia to the "Common Market" is 
conjectured in the 1990's. 
  Geographic expansion of the EC is accompanied by formation 
of 
a unified Western European economic, currency and political 
space. This may be reflected concretely in the very near future 
in creation of a unified domestic market for the 340 million 
citizens of the 12 EC countries. With that development of 
events, the entire European space west of the former USSR 
borders will be economically integrated by the end of the 1990's. 
  Conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty creates a real premise 
for forming a unified policy in security matters as well. And 
although the countries which signed it often interpret Treaty 
provisions on policy in the area of EC defense differently, it 
remains a fact that the WEU--the military-political organization 
of the West second in importance after NATO and including 9 of 
the 12 EC countries with the exception of Denmark, Greece and 
Ireland--is becoming the "military component of the EC." 
  In North America the United States of America, Canada and 
Mexico intend to conclude an agreement on free trade in this 
region. Conclusion of the Canadian-American Free Trade 
Agreement, which entered into force 1 January 1989, was an 
important step in the direction of trade integration in North 
America. Establishment of a North American free trade zone may 
become a stage in formation of such a zone within the framework 
of both Americas. 
  Similar trends also have shown up in the Asiatic-Pacific 
zone. Broad discussion of the Japanese concept of a "Pacific 
community," into which it was proposed to draw the majority of 
Asiatic countries, excluding states of a socialist orientation, 
began back in the 1970's. To counterbalance this, Australia 
proposed its own vision of Pacific economic cooperation within 
the framework of an Asiatic-Pacific Council, which also 
envisages participation of the United States and Canada. In 1991 
Malaysia came out with an initiative to establish the East Asian 
Economic Grouping. This grouping presumes the inclusion of 
Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, states of the Korean Peninsula 
and Indochina, and ASEAN. Thus, there is an active search for 
ways to establish a unified economic space in the Asiatic part 
of the Pacific region. 
  In the new situation Europe and Japan will be free to form 
those economic systems which reflect their own, not American, 
cultural preferences and which will operate in the world arena 
to maximize their own prosperity. As a result, the establishment 
of economic trade zones competing with each other and headed by 
the United States, Japan and Germany is possible. 
  The factor of intensified economic interdependence clearly 
observed in the world has a direct bearing on resolution of 
security problems facing CIS countries. The advantageousness of 
preserving a unified economic space, especially the energy and 
transportation system, cooperation ties in production, and a 
coordinated currency, taxation and customs policy, was clear to 
many at the very inception of the new interstate formation. 
  The course toward economic separatism of CIS countries 
characteristic of 1992 showed that such a policy does not ensure 
sovereignty of independent states. Reliance on western 
assistance also is not justifying itself. Life itself showed 
that restoration of inter-economic ties is a pressing need. All 
CIS members are objectively interested in financial 
stabilization, in overcoming national economic disproportions on 
a collective, interstate basis, and in creating an effective 
economic and market structure. 
  Unification of efforts in the economic area is a very 
important precondition for political harmony in the 
Commonwealth. This is fundamentally important with the possible 
establishment of a minimum of three relatively independent 
economic macrostructures in the world headed by states with a 
powerful economic potential and with the inevitable attraction 
of all other countries to these spaces. 
<H5>  1.4. Progress of Science and Technology </H5>
  A very important feature of the period being experienced by 
mankind is the rapid progress of science and technology which 
has embraced essentially all countries. The process of 
information support to all spheres of activity is going on most 
intensively. Information technology transformed the trade, 
finance and banking system; administration; and management of 
economic activity in leading world countries. Self-controlled 
machines (robots) and flexible production lines (systems) began 
to be introduced to industry and agriculture. Development of 
communications and provision for on-line consumer access to 
needed information are beginning to have a substantial effect on 
policy formation. Governments cannot help but reckon with the 
fact that they are incapable of ensuring a state monopoly on 
information about the economy, society, resources and defense. 
One aspect of national sovereignty essentially is eroding, since 
it has become possible for consumers to obtain information 
regardless of state boundaries and in the shortest possible time 
periods. 
  Another aspect of information support is automation of 
processes of intellectual activity and the significant increase 
in effectiveness of all kinds of management occurring on this 
basis. This typically does not require fundamental 
transformation of existing management structures. As a result of 
technical retooling of existing systems, they are drawn as it 
were into the makeup of structures of a higher level of 
management. As a result, with strong aspects of decentralized 
management systems preserved, the state obtains an opportunity 
to effectively influence the processes taking place from the 
standpoint of unified approaches and criteria. 
  The role of technologies based on new materials and 
biotechnology is growing along with information technologies. 
Achievements in these areas are leading to revolutionary changes 
in the development of weapon systems, which in turn can 
fundamentally alter the nature of armed forces, methods of 
warfare, ways of ensuring security, as well as the place of 
states in the world hierarchy. 
  Progress in information technologies ensures preferential 
development of sophisticated systems based on achievements of 
electronics. Outstripping progress in the direction of weapon 
development connected with command and control, reconnaissance, 
communications, and electronic warfare [EW] systems has been 
achieved as a result. They are being unified into integrated 
systems for various purposes which support continuous 
collection, processing and distribution of data among forces and 
assets at all levels right up to a theater of military 
operations and in near-real time. In addition, Persian Gulf war 
experience showed the importance of the direction of weapon 
development involving conventional precision weapon systems 
capable of confidently hitting targets at a great distance under 
all weather conditions and at any time of day in armed conflicts 
of varying levels in any region of the planet. 
  A combination of these two directions opens up an 
opportunity 
for achieving a fundamentally new level of integration of means 
of warfare within the scope of global and regional multipurpose 
and specialized systems for conducting combat operations. 
  Progress in new technologies is of special importance for 
data collection. Long-range reconnaissance and surveillance 
systems can be created that operate in any meteorological 
situation and support correlative processing of information on 
military targets, which imparts high effectiveness to 
surveillance of areas of increased military danger and to 
monitoring compliance with agreements on the limitation and ban 
of individual kinds of weapons. 
  The Persian Gulf war demonstrated the importance of the 
innovation of using new materials with properties permitting a 
substantial reduction in likelihood of timely detection of a 
platform--an aircraft or helicopter--equipped for delivering a 
strike. We are speaking of stealth technology. Using this 
technology permits reducing the level of losses severalfold. 
  On the whole, such kinds of weapons and equipment as systems 
for tracking, acquiring and identifying targets at long ranges, 
long-range delivery systems and flying craft using stealth 
technology which are in an early stage of operation or are in 
the development stage already will be integrated into the 
structure of armed forces in the 1990's. Somewhat later other 
developments--directed energy weapons, a new family of 
explosives, new data processing systems and robotics--may be 
realized in the form of deployed systems. 
  Prospects for introducing new ideas and technologies to 
weapon and military equipment development are connected with a 
buildup of the scientific-technical backlog in the form of 
developed design-circuit solutions and technologies. This 
backlog can be used if necessary as a basis for decisionmaking 
for full-scale development, production and deployment of new 
weapon systems. 
  The capability of developed countries, above all economic 
power centers, to stimulate S&amp;T progress inaccessible to a 
traditional economy of an industrial or agrarian-industrial type 
can have a destabilizing effect on the world situation as a 
result of an increased gap in standards of living of the 
population of developed and developing countries. 
  Formation of a multipolar world structure is prompting 
various countries to upgrade their armed forces. The great 
expenditures and concentration of resources needed for this 
require broad development of S&amp;T cooperation, including in 
the 
military area. Introduction of S&amp;T achievements to military 
organizational development directly affects states' level of 
protection. This goes fully for CIS states. A lag in S&amp;T 
research will not be slow in telling both as a whole on the 
status of Commonwealth states in the worldwide and regional 
structure as well as on their military security. 
  Preservation of established S&amp;T ties and their further 
coordinated, comprehensive development is a very important 
condition for ensuring reliable national and collective security 
of Commonwealth countries. 
<H3>  1.5. Preserving the Significance of Military Power as an 
Important Safeguard of National Interests </H3>
  Defense and security of states in the contemporary world 
continue to be defined by the quantitative-qualitative state of 
their armed forces. Trends attesting to formation of a new 
system of international relations confirm that military power 
continues to be an important safeguard of states' interests. 
  At first glance that conclusion differs fundamentally from 
assertions which were widespread during the 1970's and 1980's 
about a reduction in the role of military force in the overall 
system of means for ensuring security. 
  What was the basis of such assertions? Above all, the 
experience of use of military force by countries of the West 
under conditions of a bipolar system of international relations. 
  Immediately following World War II the West had no reason to 
change its view of military force as the main component of state 
might or of war as a normal form of achieving political 
objectives. Destruction of enemy armed forces, disabling of his 
military-economic potential and in the final account his 
unconditional surrender were regarded as the principal military 
objectives. A precise line was drawn between a state of war and 
a state of peace. This was the so-called "total" approach to 
wars. 
  The experience of the Korean War (1951-1953) and recognition 
of the fact that with opposing sides possessing nuclear weapons 
a war between the two blocs threatened mutual destruction led to 
an expansion of the indirect use of military force in forms of 
deterrence, pressure and coercion and to establishment of the 
idea of its measured direct use. Although military force 
continued to be perceived as one of the important components of 
a country's might, wars were divided into nuclear and 
conventional, and the former ceased to be interpreted as a 
normal form of attaining political objectives (although 
aberrations also were observed in this respect, especially in 
the period of the first Reagan administration). At the same 
time, conventional wars were viewed as a natural component of 
the political process. In accordance with the concept of 
"general war and limited wars" which predominated in that 
period, a general war no longer presumed the enemy's 
unconditional surrender, and inflicting that damage on the enemy 
which would deprive his political system of the ability to 
survive began to be viewed as a criterion of victory. A limited 
war presumed laying down a strict framework from the standpoint 
of political objectives, means used and spatial scope. Measured 
use of force proceeded from the assumption that there was no 
clear line between a state of war and a state of peace and that 
transitional stages were leveled. 
  The beginning of formation of a new approach to wars and 
armed conflicts was marked by the circumstance that realization 
of the idea of "measured" use of military force, above all 
during the war in Southeast Asia (1964-1973), produced 
insignificant results. This served as a basis for the appearance 
and strengthening in the West of the thesis of the reduced role 
of military force in contemporary international relations. The 
conclusion was argued by two premises: First of all, about the 
unacceptability of using nuclear weapons as a means of achieving 
political objectives and, secondly, by automatic prolongation of 
the effect of the bipolar world's "rules of the game" to the 
period following the end of the "cold war." 
  The contemporary development of events shows the inadequacy 
of these theses to realities of the international system that is 
forming. Results of numerous studies devoted to climatic and 
biological consequences of nuclear war, an analysis of the 
"nuclear winter" phenomenon, and results of the Chernobyl 
accident contributed to an understanding of the unacceptability 
of using nuclear weapons. With the existence of a small "nuclear 
club," the role of nuclear arms as a means of political 
influence also diminished. Practical experience shows that 
nuclear weapons provide only deterrence by great powers of each 
other and not effective deterrence of other countries. 
  But lately the circle of so-called "threshold" and 
"near-threshold" countries, i.e., states capable of joining the 
"club of nuclear powers" relatively rapidly if a political 
decision is made, has expanded considerably. Argentina, Brazil, 
Israel, India, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Taiwan, South 
Africa and South Korea (Table 1) can be included among them. An 
exchange of independently developed nuclear technologies has 
been established among these countries and in a number of cases 
they have become new exporters of this technology. The growth in 
nuclear capabilities is accompanied by the production and import 
of missiles capable of carrying up to a 500 kg payload for 
hundreds and even thousands of kilometers. The international 
trade in materials suitable for use as radiological weapons has 
acquired unprecedented scope.

2. Production capacities for creating nuclear munitions were put out of 
commission 

3. In an advanced stage. 


  Compared with the bipolar structure, the multipolar world 
structure creates enormously fewer obstacles in the path to 
realizing adventuristic political ambitions. In view of this, 
the thesis of the diminished role of military force in the 
nuclear version of war is doubtful. 
  The second argument also needs rethinking. Attaining 
political objectives by fighting wars was mutually deterred in 
the period of existence of the two systems. Wars ordinarily 
occurred in those parts of the world where the superpowers' 
influence was least. The bipolar system contributed to stability 
not only in relationships among, but also within states. Often 
this was an illusion of stability which, moreover, often was 
accompanied by a freeze on the authority of dictators or 
proteges of superpowers, but armed conflicts and clashes 
nevertheless were deterred. 
  There evidently will be considerably fewer of such checks 
and 
balances in the forming multipolar world. Any country which has 
decided to seize part of the territory of another state can 
realize its goals enormously more freely under existing 
conditions than several years ago. 
  Development of the new approach to wars was placed on a 
solid 
research basis in the West. By the end of the 1980's the United 
States had restored a number of provisions of "all-out" wars. 
(Armed forces can be used only in the presence of firm resolve 
to win victory and achieve total surrender from the enemy. The 
goals of war must be achieved swiftly and decisively, without 
dragging out the period of military operations. Different means 
of warfare are used without restriction in the war. In other 
words, attainment of military objectives is viewed as a 
precondition for achieving the political objective.) But these 
provisions relate only to conventional wars, since nuclear wars 
and a global conventional war now were viewed as very 
improbable. At the same time, the nuclear form did not disappear 
from the spectrum of use of military force. Regional wars and 
low-intensity conflicts are the focus of the West's attention, 
especially after the Persian Gulf war. 
  Considering changes in the contemporary world situation, 
U.S. 
and NATO military strategists believe that for the immediate 
period Russia and other CIS countries should no longer be viewed 
as enemies. Therefore the United States and its allies began 
devoting more attention to other areas of the world, regarding 
the unpredictability and instability of development of the 
international situation as the chief threat. But in the future 
it is proposed to bar CIS domination in Eurasia, having in mind 
the Commonwealth's nuclear and conventional military potentials 
and the likelihood of an effective system of its collective 
security being established. 
  By the end of 1991 the U.S. military-political leadership 
formulated a new content of military strategy as applied to the 
international situation up to the end of the 20th century. Four 
basic provisions are its basis. 
  1. Strategic deterrence and strategic defense as its 
element. 
Strategic deterrence remains an important principle of new U.S. 
military strategy since, in the U.S. leadership's opinion, the 
presence of nuclear arsenals of CIS states and the intensive 
development of armed forces of leading developing countries 
provide no grounds for rejecting this concept. 
  2. Capability of reacting to crisis situations. This 
provision requires rapid, effective reaction in case of the 
appearance of those regional conflicts in which vital interests 
of the United States and its allies are threatened. In 
accordance with it, in peacetime the United States must be 
capable of exerting influence in those regions where its Armed 
Forces are present on a permanent basis, and during war it must 
have the opportunity of reinforcing forward-based forces while 
simultaneously neutralizing threats in other areas important to 
the country's security. 
  3. Presence on forward lines. Demonstration of an intention 
of safeguarding its interests by military means is achieved as 
follows: by stationing groupings of armed forces on a permanent 
or rotating basis, supported by appropriate basing; by 
concluding agreements with allies and friendly countries on 
access to bases (depots); by joint planning and conduct of 
exercises and so on. 
  4. Restoration of military potential. Regardless of upcoming 
troop and arms reductions, it envisages preserving the 
capability of building up armed forces in case a regional war 
develops into a global war and in case of U.S. involvement in it. 
  To implement these provisions the U.S. Armed Forces command 
developed the "base forces" concept, which envisages upkeep of a 
minimum number of Armed Forces as the basis for deployment of 
additional units in case a regional war develops into a global 
war. Its basis is the so-called "package" principle of planning 
the Armed Forces numerical and effective combat strength. 
  The United States believes that the "base forces" concept 
permits accomplishing missions of military strategy with a 
lesser number of Armed Forces. In this connection it was 
announced that by the mid-1990's the U.S. Armed Forces numerical 
strength will be reduced by 25 percent compared with the 
numerical strength at the end of the 1980's. In fact it is 
proposed to reduce regular forces to 1.6 million persons (by 21 
percent) and reserve components to 0.9 million (by 18 percent). 
  The Army will account for the main reduction in the U.S. 
Armed Forces. The number of divisions will be reduced from 18 to 
12 in the regular forces and from 10 to 6 in the reserve. Along 
with the reduction, the objective is to make them more flexible, 
mobile and ready for rapid deployment through qualitative 
reoutfitting with advanced kinds of weapons and military 
equipment, modernization of existing models, and creation of 
precision conventional weapons. 
  By the mid-1990's it is planned to have 26 tactical air 
wings 
(72 aircraft in a wing) in the Air Force--15 in the regular 
forces and 11 in the reserve. There presently are 36--24 and 12 
equivalent wings respectively. Despite reductions, the Air Force 
command intends to maintain superiority over aviation of any 
state. To this end the proportion of multipurpose aircraft is 
being increased, their combat effectiveness is being improved 
and the air fleet is constantly being upgraded and replaced. 
Nuclear weapons are being retained in the tactical air inventory. 
  The number of U.S. Navy attack carriers is being reduced 
from 
16 to 13, the number of carrier-based air wings is being reduced 
from 15 to 13, and the overall number of ships should drop from 
545 to 451. Programs for creating the most modern means of naval 
warfare such as the guided missile cruiser Arleigh Burke and the 
nuclear powered submarine Seawolf remain in force. 
  The possibility of a further reduction in the U.S. Armed 
Forces is being examined. 
  Thus, changes in U.S. military strategy demonstrate that the 
United States has begun to retreat from a bipolar view of the 
world. This circumstance could not help but affect the direction 
of development of NATO military doctrine and organizational 
development of armed forces of the principal European countries. 
  The strategic concept adopted at a NATO Council session 
(November 1991) marks a new stage in development of North 
Atlantic Alliance military strategy. It is based on a broader 
concept of security, i.e., it reinforces the political, 
economic, social and cultural aspects of activity. The military 
component is viewed as a guarantee against a return to 
confrontation. It is believed that sufficient military force 
with corresponding combat capabilities will continue to be 
needed as a measure lowering the possibility of the outbreak of 
conflicts. A very important change in NATO strategy is a 
transfer of efforts from preparation for a general war or a war 
on the entire European continent from Norway to Turkey to 
preparation for limited or local wars. 
  The NATO leadership presently believes that the danger of a 
surprise, large-scale attack in the Central European theater has 
been eliminated and the likelihood of direct aggression against 
any of the bloc countries has been minimized. At the same time 
it is noted that the CIS (Russia) represents not only a 
"residual threat," but also a significant risk to Europe, 
considering Russia's nuclear might, military capabilities and 
potential for building them up. Four provisions of NATO military 
strategy determining armed forces organizational development 
must be noted. 
  First of all, nuclear weapons now are viewed as 
the last resort, which substantially raises the "nuclear 
threshold" and reduces the importance of tactical nuclear 
weapons. In this connection emphasis is placed on development of 
air-based and sea-based delivery vehicles possessing long range 
of deployment, high accuracy and lesser vulnerability. 
  Secondly, a "reduced forward presence" concept has 
been adopted for the Central European theater in place of the 
"forward defense" concept, which presumes rejection of 
concentrating the main Allied Forces grouping directly at 
borders and transition to its echeloned dispersion within the 
entire theater. 
  Thirdly, realization of the idea of multinational 
forces is being expanded substantially. While previously it 
extended to large strategic formations (such as the Northern and 
Central army groups), now it extends to force elements such as 
army corps, division and brigade. 
  Fourthly, the significance of mobility, both 
strategic as well as tactical, is increasing. 
  The following are principal elements of the new structure of 
bloc Allied Forces: smaller and more mobile units, multinational 
large strategic formations and formations, and an upgraded 
mobilization deployment system. In this connection it must be 
noted that it is planned to have three basic components in the 
NATO Allied Forces: Rapid Deployment Force, main defensive 
forces, and troop reinforcements. 
  Like the United States, European countries intend to reduce 
the numerical strength of their armed forces by the mid-1990's 
as follows: FRG 24 percent, Great Britain 17 percent and Italy 3 
percent. The number of strategic nuclear forces of Great Britain 
and France will remain unchanged. At the same time, their 
qualitative upgrading is planned: in Great Britain 
Resolution-Class SSBN's with 16 Polaris A-3TK SLBM's will be 
replaced by SSBN's close in characteristics to the U.S. SSBN 
Ohio and armed with Trident 2 SLBM's; France plans to replace 
SSBN's with the new Le Triomphant-Class SSBN's and equip 
strategic aviation with air-to-surface nuclear missiles produced 
using stealth technology. 
  The numerical strength of ground troops of NATO European 
countries is planned to be reduced by an average of 20-30 
percent by the mid-1990's. The number of FRG divisions will be 
cut from 12 to 10 and the number of brigades of Great Britain 
and Italy from 16 to 8 and from 21 to 17 respectively. 
  The numerical strength of air force personnel of European 
countries evidently will not change in the 1990's and the air 
fleet basically will remain the same. 
  Trends in organizational development of navies of European 
countries are ambiguous. Great Britain proposes to reduce the 
numerical strength of personnel by 17 percent and FRG by 11 
percent by the mid-1990's and France and Italy intend to keep it 
in the previous amount. The number of FRG surface ships will 
drop 43 percent, Italy will increase them by 9 percent, and they 
will remain at approximately the 1991 level in Great Britain, 
but the latter will reduce the number of submarines 41 percent. 
The number of combat aircraft will change toward an increase 
only for Italy, by 43 percent; it will remain approximately at 
the 1991 level for the other countries. The number of combat 
helicopters in the navy will increase 70 percent in the FRG and 
30 percent in France. On the whole the UK and French navies will 
retain their positions as the most important fleets of Europe. 
The role of the Italian Navy may rise. 
  On the whole the changes occurring in military doctrines and 
organizational development of armed forces of foreign countries 
are rather substantial, but their direction and proposed results 
do not permit concluding that the world will become safer by the 
end of the 1990's. The doctrinal shift from preparation for 
all-out (global) war to preparation for regional wars signifies 
only that the possibility of using armed conflicts as a means of 
achieving national interests is preserved. Although the makeup 
and structure of armed forces of western countries basically are 
stabilizing toward the mid-1990's, constant outfitting of troops 
with increasingly advanced models of weapons and military 
equipment increases their combat capabilities, and this cannot 
help but be taken into account in military organizational 
development of CIS states and in formation of a collective 
security system. 
  The influence of a particular state in the world arena is 
determined not only by the political and military objectives it 
sets for itself, but also by the status of its 
military-industrial base, by its "contribution" to the arms 
trade and by its position in arms control talks. 
  Contemporary military production (outside the CIS) is 
concentrated in the United States, Western Europe and the Far 
East, which actually coincides with the main world power 
centers. The dominant position in this production belongs to the 
United States, which possesses a powerful scientific-production 
base permitting creation and output of all types of nuclear and 
conventional weapons using latest technologies and materials. 
  The main production capacities of Western European military 
industry are concentrated in the FRG, France and Great Britain. 
These countries supply their own armies' needs for arms and 
military equipment and are the competition for the United States 
in the world arms market. 
  Japan potentially is capable of producing any arms, 
including 
nuclear arms. For political reasons, the Japanese do not produce 
mass destruction weapons or those kinds of arms categorized as 
offensive. Factors of a political nature in the new world 
situation may cease to be a means deterring Japan from producing 
those kinds of weapons. 
  Military production is growing in developing countries which 
have a sufficient S&amp;T and industrial base and necessary 
materials and raw material resources and which use foreign 
licenses. This trend is capable of affecting the world balance 
of military forces in the not-too-distant future. 
  A number of developing countries already essentially have 
fully met the needs of their own armed forces for artillery, 
small arms, ammunition, multiple-launch rocket systems, various 
classes of tactical missiles, and partially for light armored 
equipment and small combatants. The majority of these countries 
emphasize development of operational-tactical missiles. 
  The growth of military production in developing countries 
permits them to feel less dependent on developed states and to 
behave more independently in choosing a political course. 
  The arms and military equipment trade has become an 
important 
factor of the international situation and its volume is 
constantly increasing. The main flow of weapons (two-thirds of 
deliveries for 1981-1990) goes from developed to developing 
countries. The Near and Middle East account for the principal 
part of this amount. Saudi Arabia was the chief importing 
country in the 1980's, accounting for a third of all deliveries 
to developing countries. Egypt, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, 
India, Pakistan and Thailand are among the countries supporting 
their military potential through imports to a considerable 
extent. The proportion of new and the latest models is growing 
in the world arms and military equipment trade, which 
qualitatively changes the nature of probable armed conflicts in 
the zone of developing countries. 
  New exporters from among developing countries, above all 
Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Pakistan, Singapore and South Korea, 
are moving into the world arms trade market along with 
traditional suppliers. They offer modern models of arms and 
military equipment of their own development which have imported 
assemblies and parts, or assemblies and parts being produced 
under licenses. Almost the entire volume of these exporters' 
deliveries is oriented toward developing countries. This leads 
to where, in case armed conflicts break out in Asia, Africa or 
Latin America, their participants' needs can be met more fully 
by suppliers which are not under the control of developed states. 
  Arms control talks became an influential factor of 
international relations back in the "cold war" years. 
Implementation of treaties concluded on strategic and 
conventional arms is substantially reducing their arsenal in 
Europe and to a certain extent in the United States. For the 
time being only the United States and Russia are reducing their 
nuclear potentials. The other "nuclear club" members are not 
taking part. The negotiation process has not affected developing 
countries for now. Meanwhile, the new world situation demands 
the most fixed attention of the world community to problems of 
disarmament in these countries. 
  It is not difficult to foresee that in the upcoming decade 
there will be an exacerbation of the problem of horizontal 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and of ensuring control of 
conventional arms in the world as a whole. Serious progress in 
the conventional arms control area had been achieved only in 
Europe by the beginning of the 1990's. Consistent fulfillment of 
the Paris Treaty on Conventional Arms (1990) should eliminate 
the possibility of the delivery of surprise strikes and conduct 
of wide-scale operations in Europe. 
  An analysis shows that in parallel with changes in the 
global 
political, economic and cultural-ethnic picture, there is 
latent, slow progress in the disposition and correlation of 
forces from a military aspect. While there continue to be highly 
effective nuclear and conventional forces in a number of 
countries west and east of the CIS, which requires preserving 
the appropriate strategic balance, the military potential of 
countries lying south of the CIS has a tendency to grow 
steadily. In view of the fact that the situation in this region 
is fraught with unexpectedness and the possibility of crises 
developing into local conflicts and regional wars, it is 
important to be ready to prevent and stop them in the interests 
of all Commonwealth states. 
<H5>  1.6. An Increase in the Level of Conflict </H5>
  Contemporary security problems are linked inseparably with a 
sharp increase in the number of regional conflicts on political, 
national-ethnic and religious soil. Southeastern Europe, the 
Near and Middle East and territories of a number of former USSR 
republics (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan and 
the Caucasian region of Russia) have become the principal 
conflict zones. The geographic position of conflict zones and 
political aspects of their development have a direct bearing on 
CIS security. 
  Above all this concerns conflicts on territories of 
Commonwealth member countries as well as of former Soviet 
republics which did not become its members. According to 
official statistics, 125 peoples lived in the former USSR, the 
majority of whom inhabit compact ethnic territories. At the same 
time, 65 million persons live outside of their national 
formations and 50 million are consolidated as mixed national 
families. Even these data alone show how complex the problem is. 
It is aggravated both by disputes concerning one and the same 
territory historically belonging to different ethnoses and the 
right to be an autonomy or an independent state, as well as by 
changes in the demographic situation because of an increased 
proportion of a foreign ethnic population, in part as a result 
of the deportation of certain nationalities of the USSR during 
1937-1944. Clarification of the outline of many boundaries 
between former USSR republics, which in a unitary state 
essentially were of a formal, conditionally administrative 
nature, is of special significance in this respect. 
  Perpetuation of sources of tension conceals the threat of 
escalation of inter-ethnic conflicts. The zone of conflict 
actions on former USSR territory expanded from year to year. 
While Nagornyy Karabakh was practically the only site of armed 
clashes in 1988, several conflict centers already had arisen in 
the Transcaucasus and Central Asia in 1989; then the flame of 
very acute conflicts spread to the North Caucasus and Dniester 
region. The tendency toward a buildup in the explosive mass of 
conflict threatens security on the Euro-Asiatic continent as a 
whole. 
  This causes natural concern of states situated west, south 
and east of the CIS. The world community does not need a sixth 
of the planet split, fighting, or shaken by crises and 
conflicts, but a united, flourishing community independently 
solving its own internal problems and capable of actively 
participating in resolving international security problems. 
  All this turns the prevention of armed conflicts, or their 
limitation and cessation in case they have arisen, into a very 
important task in organizing the post-Soviet space, above all 
within boundaries of the CIS and nearby. 
  An analysis of trends in development of international 
relations confirms that the world community is entering a new 
era in its development--an era of radical change in the 
disposition of forces in the international arena, a change in 
goals and tasks of the participants of world politics, a growth 
of economic interdependence, and an intensification of conflict 
on a local and regional level. 
  Under these conditions the western powers' official 
rejection 
of military-political confrontation with CIS member states and 
their readiness to build relations on the basis of dialogue, 
trust and cooperation are of fundamental importance. At the same 
time the facts show that attempts by individual countries or 
groups of countries to follow a course toward regional or global 
domination based on military-force approaches are not precluded 
in various regions of the world. The internationalization and 
escalation of national and religious crises and the 
disintegration of multi-ethnic states also are capable of 
leading to military clashes. 
  Instability of the domestic political and socioeconomic 
situation in CIS states contributes to the perpetuation of 
danger. Such instability is dictated above all by socioeconomic 
crisis, presence of zones of military conflicts, unresolved 
nature of mutual claims, including the division of property of 
the former USSR, and appearance of unconstitutional armed units. 
  Internal instability in CIS states is becoming a source of 
threat not only to national security, but also to regional and 
world security. And the circumstance that a number of 
Commonwealth countries are incapable of coping with the causes 
of instability by themselves dictates the need to consolidate 
efforts, above all economic and defense efforts, for supporting 
a course of democratic transformations, prosperity and peace for 
CIS peoples. 
<H3>  Part 2 - The CIS--A New Form of Association of Sovereign 
Countries </H3>
  The February and October revolutions of 1917 and the 
attempted coup d'&eacute;tat in August 1991 became events whose 
consequences played an enormous role in changing Russia's 
appearance in the 20th century. The Romanov family's reign over 
one-sixth of land on Earth ended in 1917 and creation of the 
Soviet Union, proclaimed by the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belorussia and 
the Transcausus Republic on 30 December 1922, began on the 
Russian Empire's ruins. Removal of the Communist Party from 
power concluded in 1991, which in the final account led to 
termination of the Soviet Union's existence as a unitary state. 
<H5>  2.1. Formation of the Commonwealth </H5>
  The process of disintegration and above all decentralization 
of power in favor of republics in the USSR began to deepen 
toward the end of the 1980's. Among the principal reasons for 
this was dissatisfaction with the standard of living and a 
growth of socioeconomic problems. Attempts failed to adapt the 
socioeconomic system to the new conditions in the latter half of 
the 1980's while keeping state ownership and the 
administrative-command management system practically inviolable. 
Relying on the 1977 USSR Constitution, under which they had the 
right to leave the Union, republics one after the other began 
declaring their independence or supremacy of their laws over 
Union laws. 
  The crisis of central authority sparked a search for new 
forms of inter-republic relations. A number of attempts were 
made during 1991 to find an optimum solution to this problem. On 
24 April USSR President M. S. Gorbachev and leaders of nine 
Union republics adopted a joint Declaration which noted the need 
for signing a new Union Treaty; this presumed adoption of a new 
Constitution and new elections. This Declaration was not signed 
by Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The 
draft Union Treaty was published in late June 1991 and was 
approved by nine republics. Armenia joined their number and 
Ukraine left. In accordance with the draft Treaty a minimum of 
functions connected above all with ensuring external security 
and forming a budget remained under the purview of Union 
structures. The draft Treaty was to have been opened for signing 
on 19 August 1991. 
  The attempted coup d'&eacute;tat during 19-21 August led to 
where those republics which had not yet announced their 
independence did so. The process of decentralizing the political 
structure accelerated. Republics received the right to full 
autonomy in their domestic affairs. By November 1991 the 
disintegration process led to termination of the development of 
any kind of supplementary agreements. Relying on declarations of 
independence and sovereignty, the republics began speeding up 
the transition of Union ownership and interests to republic 
subordination. A referendum and presidential elections in 
Ukraine, which made any likelihood of this republic joining any 
kind of structure with central coordinating authorities null and 
void, became very important events.

*The Russian Federation did not adopt any kind of document similar to other 
republics' documents establishing independence. 


  Thus, the potential for reform of the Soviet Union had been 
totally exhausted by the end of 1991. The leadership of 
republics which belonged to the USSR realized the need to find a 
new form of joint existence guaranteeing independence and equal 
rights on the one hand and on the other hand preventing total, 
uncontrollable disintegration of the former Union, which was 
fraught with the possibility of outbreak of a Yugoslav type of 
conflict. 
  A new legal and political form of voluntary association of 
the sovereign states was found at a meeting of heads of state of 
the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus in Belovezhskaya 
pushcha near Minsk: an Agreement on Establishment of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States was signed on 8 December 
1991. The Agreement Preamble stated: "We, the republics of 
Belarus, Russian Federation and Ukraine, as founding states of 
the USSR which signed the 1922 Treaty, verify that the USSR is 
ceasing its existence as a component of international law and as 
a geopolitical reality." 
  Two weeks later, on 21 December 1991, eight others 
(Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) joined the three 
republic-initiators in Alma-Ata. The Soviet Union actually 
ceased to exist on 25 December 1991 after USSR President 
Gorbachev officially announced termination of performance of his 
duties. 
  In accordance with decisions made in Minsk and Alma-Ata, the 
eleven countries parties agreed to the following: 

  -  recognize and respect each other's territorial integrity 
and the inviolability of existing borders; 
  -  guarantee openness of borders and freedom of movement of 
citizens and transfer of information within the framework of the 
Commonwealth (in ratifying the Agreement Ukraine declared that 
its boundary line with Russia and Belarus is its state border); 
  -  cooperate in ensuring international peace and security and in 
taking effective steps to reduce arms and military expenditures; 
strive for elimination of all nuclear arms and for general and 
complete disarmament under strict international control; 
  -  respect each other's desire to attain the status of a 
non-nuclear zone or neutral state; 
  -  recognize the area of foreign-policy activity, fight against 
organized crime and so on as their sphere of joint activity 
realized on the basis of equal rights through common 
coordinating institutions of the Commonwealth; 
  -  guarantee fulfillment of international obligations stemming 
for 
them from treaties and agreements of the former USSR; 
  -  accomplish the interworking of Commonwealth members on the 
principle of equal rights through coordinating institutions 
being formed on a parity basis and operating under the procedure 
determined by the Agreement among members of the Commonwealth, 
which is neither a state nor a suprastate formation. 

    Commonwealth member countries declared the following: 

  -  they intend to develop their relations based on mutual 
recognition and respect of state sovereignty, inalienable right 
to self-determination, principles of equal rights and 
nonintervention in internal affairs, rejection of the use of 
force and of economic or other methods of pressure, settlement 
of controversial problems by conciliation methods, and respect 
for human rights and freedoms and other generally recognized 
principles and rules of international law; 
  -  they believe that development and strengthening of relations 
of 
friendship, good-neighborliness and mutually advantageous 
cooperation among them, which have deep historical roots, are in 
the fundamental national interests of their peoples and serve 
the cause of peace and security; 
  -  they affirm their adherence to goals and principles of the UN 
Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and other CSCE documents; 
  -  they recognize their responsibility for preserving civil 
peace 
and inter-ethnic concord. 

    The year 1992 became the year of development of mutually 
acceptable forms of cooperation based on the 1991 Belovezh and 
Alma-Ata agreements. Each state of the former USSR chose its own 
path of development, which determined the diversity of their 
attitude toward the CIS. 
  It was learned practically at once that there were two 
prevailing viewpoints shared (with certain nuances) by the 
republics which signed the 1991 Alma-Ata Agreement. One 
viewpoint presumed a movement toward establishing an eastern 
analogue of the European Union and NATO--a Euro-Asiatic 
community--in place of the USSR. As a result of the process of 
such a community's formation it was proposed to establish an 
effective interstate association with coordinating bodies, a 
unified economic space, unified currency, unified market reform 
strategy, coordinated taxation and customs policy, combined 
armed forces, transparent internal borders, and joint control of 
external borders. These ideas were shared by a large group of 
countries headed by Kazakhstan and Russia. 
  The second viewpoint reduced to the need to establish within 
the framework of the former USSR only a mechanism permitting its 
members to resolve problems of Soviet heritage in various areas 
in a civilized manner. This point of view was manifested most 
clearly in Ukraine's position. 
  The development of events led to a change in the status of 
Azerbaijan and Moldova in the CIS: The Azerbaijan Parliament did 
not ratify the Alma-Ata Declaration and the Moldovan Parliament 
did not consider it. At the same time, Moldovan President M. 
Snegur signed the Declaration of the Council of Heads of States 
Parties to the CIS in January 1993, which recorded the intention 
of preserving the Commonwealth. Representatives of these states 
are taking part in the work of CIS bodies and structures. 
Representatives of Georgia, which postponed a decision on the 
question of joining the Commonwealth until the period after 
stabilization of the domestic political situation, also are 
taking part in CIS work. 
  From the moment they declared their sovereignty the Baltic 
republics (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) set a course toward 
distancing themselves from the USSR and toward rapprochement 
with countries of Western Europe. After formation of the CIS the 
Baltic countries began to adhere to the line of rejecting 
cooperation with the former Soviet republics on a multilateral 
basis. 
  The year which passed after signing of the Agreement on the 
CIS, the Protocol thereto and the Alma-Ata Declaration showed 
that respect for different paths of development and tolerance 
for contradictoriness of positions could be a basis for 
formation of the Commonwealth. The following circumstances also 
contributed to this. During 1992 the new states acquired basic 
attributes of statehood and were recognized by the world 
community. New structures of authority were elected and are 
operating in the majority of them. The practical conclusion of 
the division of former USSR property and the republics' 
establishment of their own full control over local resources 
became an important factor. 
  The formation of Commonwealth states as independent 
components of international relations is coupled with their 
difficult, sobering realization of the real opportunities for 
obtaining foreign economic assistance and for involvement in 
international associations outside the CIS, and also realization 
of prospects for their own move into foreign markets. Life 
showed the effective role of mutual relations of former USSR 
republics in all areas and the need for preserving and 
developing them on a qualitatively new basis of equality and 
civilized partnership which takes full account of each other's 
national-state interests. 
  Two directions of cooperation were developed. The first 
encompassed efforts connected with formation of a set of 
bilateral relations among CIS states as components of 
international relations. The second included work to establish a 
multilateral basis of cooperation. Adoption of the CIS Charter 
in Minsk in January 1993 became a kind of milestone in 
materializing these interrelated directions. Stressing that the 
Commonwealth is not a state and does not possess supranational 
powers, the Charter proclaims its following objectives: 

  -  cooperation in different areas; 
  -  comprehensive, balanced economic and social development of 
member states within the framework of a common economic space, 
and interstate cooperation and integration; 
  -  assurance of human rights and basic freedoms; 
  -  cooperation among member states in ensuring international 
peace 
and security; 
  -  assistance to citizens of member states in free 
intercourse, contacts and movement within the Commonwealth; 
  -  mutual legal assistance and cooperation in other spheres of 
legal relations; 
  -  peaceful resolution of disputes and 
conflicts. 

    The Charter includes the following among spheres of joint 
activity of member states, realized on the basis of equal rights 
through common coordinating institutions: 

  -  coordination of foreign policy activity; 
  -  cooperation in forming and developing a common economic 
space, 
European and Euro-Asiatic markets, and customs policy; 
  -  cooperation in developing transportation and communication 
systems; 
  -  protection of health and the environment; 
  -  questions of social and migration policy; 
  -  fight against organized crime; 
  -  cooperation in the area of defense policy and security of 
external borders. 

    The Charter confirms principles of mutual relations of 
member 
countries laid down in the Agreement on Establishment of the CIS 
and the Alma-Ata Declaration. 
  The Charter allows different forms of integration and 
accession to it. Nine states which, at the moment the Charter 
was signed, signed and ratified the Agreement on Establishment 
of the CIS dated 8 December 1991 and the Protocol to this 
Agreement dated 21 December 1991 are founding states of the 
Commonwealth. They are Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and 
Ukraine. Those founding states which assume obligations under 
the present Charter within one year after its adoption by the 
Heads of State Council are considered member states. This 
concerns all the above nine states with consideration of the 
fact that the leaders of seven states (Armenia, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, 
Uzbekistan) adopted the Commonwealth Charter and recommended it 
to their countries' parliaments for ratification, and two 
states, Turkmenistan and Ukraine, did not sign the decision on 
the CIS Charter. A state which shares the objectives and 
principles of the Commonwealth and assumes obligations contained 
in the Charter also can become a Commonwealth member by 
accession to it with the consent of all member states. Moldova, 
Azerbaijan, Georgia and others can be such states. 
  A state desiring to participate in individual forms of 
Commonwealth activity can accede to it as an associate member on 
terms specified by the Agreement on Associate Membership. By 
decision of the Heads of State Council, representatives of other 
states may take part in work of Commonwealth bodies as observers. 
  Adoption of the Charter proved the viability of the CIS by 
putting an end to the period of uncertainty. Those states which 
signed the Charter in fact declared their readiness for further 
integration in all areas. Those states which signed only the 
Declaration of Heads of States Parties expressed their interest 
in the Commonwealth's further existence and in deepening of 
economic integration. All this shows that of the two 
trends--toward expansion of cooperation in different areas and 
toward use of the CIS only as a means of civilized divorce--the 
former is beginning to predominate.

<H6>  Initiators of CIS Establishment on Importance of the 
Commonwealth </H6>
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin: 
  "The Commonwealth lived and gathered experience. We 
realized that we cannot live without each other. Experience in 
peacemaking actions appeared. What the CSCE and UN Security 
Council failed to do managed to be done by CIS peacemaking 
forces in some of its regions. The CIS is the only real form for 
solving common problems." 
  Chairman of Belarusian Parliament Stanislav Shushkevich: 
  "I am absolutely convinced that the minimum of tasks 
which Belarus posed in the CIS managed to be done. We would not 
have succeeded in resolving many of the problems within the 
framework of bilateral relations." 
  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk: 
  "Not all questions have to be resolved within the 
Commonwealth framework. In a number of cases bilateral relations 
are of enormously greater importance. But there are those 
problems which can be resolved only today and only in the 
CIS."

<H3>  2.2 Formation of Approaches to Collective Security and to 
Cooperation of CIS States in the Military Area </H3>
  Political events on territory of the former Soviet Union 
could not help but tell on the status of armed forces and on 
approaches to safeguarding the security of peoples populating 
the post-Soviet space. The need to conduct military reform and 
the military policy of the leadership--initially of republics 
within the framework of the USSR and then of independent 
states--became basic factors affecting the direction of armed 
forces organizational development during 1991-1992. 
  The question of reforming the Army and Navy began to be 
discussed from the end of the 1980's. In this period the 
following were proposed as basic directions of reform: 
increasing the effectiveness of leadership of the entire sphere 
of the country's defense; bringing the structure of armed 
forces, directions of weapon and military equipment development, 
and financing of military organizational development into line 
with the real military danger; orienting military organizational 
development toward qualitative characteristics of defense; 
professionalizing the army in stages; democratizing society's 
entire military organization in accordance with principles of a 
rule-of-law state and rules of international law; and taking 
national-historical traditions and progressive experience of 
military organizational development into account. 
  The need for military reform was dictated above all because 
maintaining an army of four million did not equate to conditions 
of the end of the "cold war." Tasks of reducing the numerical 
strength of armed forces and arms, social protection of 
servicemen, professionalization of the army and its structure, 
and other tasks shifted to a practical plane. A reduction in the 
armed forces of a half-million persons was accomplished within 
the channel of realization of these tasks; the structure of 
armed forces large strategic ground formations was rationally 
reorganized in a defensive spirit with an unprecedentedly abrupt 
reduction in the proportion of tanks by 20-40 percent; a 
defensive grouping began to be established within USSR borders 
with the withdrawal of all military contingents from abroad; 
intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles were mutually 
eliminated with the United States; treaties were concluded on 
strategic offensive arms reduction (START) and on conventional 
armed forces in Europe; and extensive work was done on real 
confidence-building measures. 
  The army reform process accelerated sharply after August 
1991. The party was eliminated from the armed forces and the 
system of military-political bodies was abolished. The previous 
armed forces structure conformed less and less to the new 
political situation with the growth of disintegrative processes 
which encompassed the defense sphere as well. At the same time, 
the state and armed forces leadership continued to proceed from 
the assumption that a unified economic space had to be ensured 
by a unified defensive space and unified armed forces. The 
importance of armed forces unity also was dictated by 
international aspects. Noncompliance with the USSR's treaties 
with other states and a change in the regime of involvement in 
multilateral agreements could negatively affect the 
international security system. 
  Much spoke in favor of that choice. The USSR Armed Forces 
were built as unified armed forces with a rigidly centralized 
command and control and a unified system of support and military 
infrastructure. They were stationed throughout USSR territory, 
but the most sizeable groupings were concentrated in Central and 
Eastern Europe and in the western and eastern parts of the 
country. Strategic nuclear forces were stationed in Russia, 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. The Army and Air Force were 
stationed in all republics, and very unevenly, since attack 
groupings had been established on the western axis. 
  The uneven stationing of USSR Armed Forces on the territory 
of republics in 1991 is evident from Table 2.

  The Armed Forces began to be reorganized in four directions. 
The first was professionalization. Gradual progress 
toward a professional army was proposed, based on comprehensive 
calculations taking into account realities of the international 
military-political situation and the country's socioeconomic and 
scientific-technical capacities. 
  The second direction was a qualitative upgrading 
of armed forces in various areas: technical outfitting, table of 
organization structure, command and control, and support. 
  The third direction involved social aspects of the 
Army and Navy: democratization of life in the Armed Forces based 
on openness and glasnost for everything concerning military 
service that does not comprise state or military secrets. The 
activity of officer meetings; functioning efficiency report 
boards; warrant officer, NCO and petty officer councils; 
personnel meetings; and public organizations began to be livened 
up for this purpose. 
  The fourth direction was observance of the 
principle of sufficiency. In the views of the new command 
element, this principle had to be materialized in the following 
approach: have nothing in excess and create nothing in excess 
that is not needed for national defense, i.e., provide an 
effective defense with minimum forces and assets with least 
costs. 
  On the whole, unified armed forces possessing high 
professionalism, outfitted with modern arms and military 
equipment, possessing a developed infrastructure, having a 
democratic organization of life and sufficient for absolutely 
reliable defense of a Union state were to be the result of the 
outlined plans. 
  It was proposed that republic authorities and their military 
structures would take part in developing and implementing 
military policy, forming a defense budget, training reserves, 
organizing the call-up and so on. Establishing small military 
units of the national guard type at the disposal of republics 
was considered justified to support the republics' real 
sovereignty. 
  Proclamation of independence of the Soviet Union's republics 
did not directly lead to a change in positions of the leadership 
of individual countries after the August events of 1991. This 
was manifested in the fact that in the course of various 
conferences all republics (with the exception of Baltic 
countries) affirmed the need for unity of armed forces in 
establishing a guard in the republics based on internal security 
forces. 
  The Agreement on Establishment of the CIS, the Protocol 
thereto and the Alma-Ata Declaration were characterized by a 
desire to keep the armed forces unified. Essentially no one with 
the exception of Ukraine cast doubt on the need to act 
specifically that way. No one's plans extended further than 
establishing national guards. In the 8 December 1991 Agreement 
the parties pledged "to preserve and keep the common 
military-strategic space under combined command, including 
unified control over nuclear weapons." In this connection 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman V. Shushkevich declared: "We 
had to find a worthy version so that, having received genuine 
sovereignty, the borders would not be disconnected and we would 
follow a policy that was independent but coordinated with 
neighbors. . . . It seems we were able to do this. We found a 
version for preserving unified armed forces and a unified 
military-strategic space." 
  The Alma-Ata Declaration also affirmed: "The Combined 
Command 
of military-strategic forces and unified control over nuclear 
weapons will be preserved to ensure international strategic 
stability and security." It was in the Belovezh Agreement that 
the parties guaranteed necessary conditions for stationing, 
functioning, and material and social support of armed forces and 
pledged to follow a coordinated policy in questions of social 
protection and pension support of servicemen and their families. 
  The military security question was brought up for discussion 
of heads of state on 30 December 1991. A very important decision 
which predetermined subsequent development in the 
military-political area was the accord of Commonwealth member 
states on each one's right to establish its own armed forces. 
For Ukraine the beginning of operation of such a right already 
had been established from 3 January 1992. In this connection the 
task was set to consider and decide within a two-month period 
the question of the procedure for command and control of general 
purpose forces and the sequence for Commonwealth states' 
implementation of the right to establish their own armed forces. 
It was proposed to develop--also in a two-month period--a 
mechanism of activity of border guard troops with consideration 
of requirements of the national legislation of Commonwealth 
states. 
  The question of nuclear weapons and strategic forces 
remained 
a very important military security problem in the stage of the 
Commonwealth's origin and formation. It was documents of the 
Belovezh meeting that emphasized the need for unified control 
over nuclear weapons and their nonproliferation. At Alma-Ata 
four states on whose territory nuclear weapons and their 
delivery vehicles were stationed--Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russian 
Federation and Ukraine--signed the Agreement on Joint Measures 
with Respect to Nuclear Weapons. One of the most important 
provisions of this document was that "nuclear weapons which are 
in the combined strategic armed forces ensure the collective 
security of all CIS members." At the same time the question of 
tactical nuclear weapons was resolved: in accordance with 
international understandings, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine 
pledged to ensure evacuation of such weapons to central preplant 
bases in Russia for their dismantling by 1 July 1992. The 
parties confirmed adherence to principles of nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons: they pledged not to transfer to anyone 
whomsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices 
and technologies or control over such nuclear and explosive 
devices directly or indirectly; and not to assist, encourage or 
induce any non-nuclear-weapon state to manufacture or acquire 
nuclear weapons. 
  The Agreement on Strategic Forces signed in Minsk on 30 
December 1991 was of great significance. The significance of 
this Agreement is that all Commonwealth member states agreed 
that strategic forces are subject to centralized command and 
control and must be under unified leadership and control of the 
combined command. 
  Gradually the preservation of unified armed forces became 
more and more at odds with the new realities. The previous 
military reform requirements lost urgency with the beginning of 
organizational development of national armies of independent 
states. 
  The Armed Forces leadership advanced the idea of 
transforming 
unified armed forces into combined armed forces under an 
atypical, nonstandard scheme. Its essence was to ensure conduct 
of comprehensive transformations with preservation of the most 
important elements of the common space and of a unified military 
infrastructure within the scope of a transition period of 
necessary and sufficient duration, a minimum of 3-5 years. This 
would allow using the economic, military-technical and strictly 
military advantages of the unified system in the interests of 
all member states and would help protect vital interests of 
servicemen and their families. Also of no less importance was 
that this would not engender reasons for new conflicts, for 
encroachments on good-neighbor relations and cooperation, and 
for militarization of crises. 
  It was proposed that the functions and missions of the 
combined armed forces initially would remain the same as for the 
USSR Armed Forces. Subsequently national armies would be 
established on the basis of formations, units and establishments 
of the combined armed forces while resolving social and legal 
questions of servicemen in Commonwealth states in an agreed upon 
and coordinated manner. All elements of systems common to 
Commonwealth states--command and control, communications, 
reconnaissance, air defense, ABM defense, space defense, 
technical and logistic support, and preparation of theaters of 
military operations--were to be preserved and developed as 
applied to the changed conditions. To a certain extent these 
plans were reflected in documents adopted at the Heads of State 
Council in Minsk on 14 February 1992 and in Kiev on 20 March 
1992. 
  The Minsk meeting essentially concluded the first stage of 
transforming unified armed forces into combined armed forces. 
Marshal of Aviation Ye. I. Shaposhnikov became their commander 
in chief. Three components became part of the Combined Armed 
Forces--strategic forces, general purpose forces and the armed 
forces proper of those states which announced their 
establishment. The General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces and 
other military command and control bodies made up the basis of 
the Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces High Command. 
  In accordance with the Agreement on the Status of Strategic 
Forces (14 February 1992) it was recognized that they function 
as an independent large strategic formation. Leadership of 
Commonwealth Strategic Forces is exercised by the CinC Strategic 
Forces subordinate to the Heads of State Council and to the CinC 
CIS Combined Armed Forces. The Strategic Forces are intended for 
ensuring security of all states parties to the Agreement and are 
maintained through fixed contributions of these states. The 
Agreement was signed on behalf of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. According to terms of the 
Agreement, each state has the right to secede from it, which 
requires written notification one year in advance. Ukraine 
stipulated the period of its secession in advance--1994. 
  The Agreement on General Purpose Forces (14 February 1992) 
fixed two components of the Combined Armed Forces--combined 
general purpose forces and armed forces proper of Commonwealth 
member states. Large strategic formations, formations, units, 
establishments, military educational institutions, other 
military force elements and military installations not part of 
the CIS Strategic Forces, as well as the member states' own 
armed forces that are operationally subordinate, with their 
consent, to the CIS Combined Armed Forces High Command were 
included among general purpose forces. 
  The line toward establishing a legal basis for the Combined 
Armed Forces was continued at the next meeting in Kiev on 20 
March 1992. The Agreement on Combined Forces for the Transition 
Period defined the Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces as 
consisting of strategic forces and general purpose forces. The 
objectives for establishing the CIS Combined Armed Forces were 
formulated as follows: 

  -  need for mutually acceptable, organized resolution of 
questions on reforming the Armed Forces of the former USSR; 
  -  need for ensuring security of member states, preserving 
command 
and control and preventing conflicts. 

    To support the functioning of the Combined Armed Forces, 
questions were decided in Minsk on 14 February 1992 on forming a 
unified defense budget, on the procedure for financing armed 
forces of Commonwealth states, and on social and legal 
guarantees for servicemen, persons discharged from military 
service and their families; and problems were resolved in Kiev 
on 20 March 1992 on legal foundations of the activity of CIS 
Combined Armed Forces, principles of CIS Combined Armed Forces 
manpower acquisition and performance of duty in them, principles 
of providing CIS member states with arms, military equipment and 
other materiel, principles of organizing RDT&amp;E, and the 
status 
of general purpose forces of the CIS Combined Armed Forces for 
the transition period. 
  It was proposed to include the following kinds of costs in 
the unified defense budget: Upkeep of the Army and Navy; payment 
for arms, military equipment and property, including procurement 
of nuclear munitions; payment for S&amp;T products; capital 
construction and major overhaul, including special and housing 
construction and pension support for servicemen and their 
families. The Agreement on a Unified Defense Budget was signed 
by Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation, 
Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Belarus, Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan stipulated nonparticipation in financing nuclear 
weapon procurements. Azerbaijan and Ukraine refused to take part 
in forming the defense budget. These states agreed only to 
participation financing for the upkeep of strategic forces on 
their own territory. 
  The Agreement on Social and Legal Guarantees of Servicemen, 
Persons Discharged from Military Service and Their Families was 
of great importance. Based on the need for adopting agreed-upon 
measures in this matter, the member states decided to preserve 
the level of rights and privileges previously established by 
laws and other legislative instruments of the USSR for the 
category of the aforementioned persons. 
  Decisions of an organizational nature played a role of no 
small importance in realizing the idea of forming the Combined 
Armed Forces: the appointment of Colonel General V. N. Samsonov 
as chief of staff of the CIS Combined Armed Forces, General of 
the Army Yu. P. Maksimov as CinC Strategic Forces, and Colonel 
General V. M. Semenov as CinC General Purpose Forces. 
  Decisions made in Minsk and Kiev proposed to secure the 
existence of the Combined Armed Forces for a rather lengthy 
period, and not just for the transition period (only Belarus 
stipulated the time of the transition period: in some agreements 
one year, in others two years). Such a provision was based on 
Russia's voluntary desire, considering the wishes and plans of 
other independent states, to bear the main burdens connected 
with functioning and transformation of the Armed Forces. 
  Intensification of centrifugal tendencies and a practical 
transition to creation of its own armed forces by Ukraine and 
then also by a number of other independent states called into 
question realization of the plan for establishing combined armed 
forces directly on the basis of the unified armed forces. The 
situation was exacerbated by the fact that essentially the 
entire defense budget in the first quarter of 1992 was covered 
exclusively at the expense of Russia and partially of Ukraine. 
Taking all this into account, Russian President B. N. Yeltsin 
signed the Edict on Establishing the Russian Armed Forces on 7 
May 1992. Russia's role and importance in CIS affairs 
predetermined the influence of this act on the further course of 
military organizational development in the CIS. 
  It is important to bear two factors in mind here. First of 
all, the Russian Armed Forces are the nucleus of the military 
component of Commonwealth defense and security in makeup, 
structure and combat capabilities. Secondly, Russia and its 
Armed Forces represent the main source of help and assistance to 
CIS states in establishing their own armed forces. Of all 
Commonwealth states, only Russia is capable of producing the end 
models of weapons and equipment. Essentially all military 
scientific research institutes are in Russia. Ninety percent of 
aircraft are fabricated on its territory and 80 percent of 
military higher educational institutions are located there. Only 
in Russia is there a General Staff Military Academy where 
military specialists of the top command and control echelon are 
trained. 
  The decision on establishing the Russian Armed Forces 
signified the conclusion to the second stage of military 
organizational development within the Commonwealth framework and 
the beginning of the third stage, whose essence was acquisition 
of state affiliation by troops (naval forces). It was envisaged 
that armed forces of independent states would assign specific 
military contingents to the Combined Armed Forces for 
safeguarding common geostrategic interests, above all the 
"nuclear umbrella," for all parties to collective security. 
  Construction of a collective security system by CIS 
countries 
under present conditions is very original. This is determined by 
the fact that, in entering into a relationship of cooperation 
with each other in the defense area, the new states basically do 
not have their own armies or national military infrastructure, 
but have just begun taking the path of establishing them. The 
decision on forming a Council of Ministers of Defense of 
Commonwealth Member States adopted in Minsk on 14 February 1992 
played an essential role in this connection. The Ministers of 
Defense Council became the supreme collective body of the Heads 
of State Council in questions of military policy and military 
organizational development of member states. Among the most 
important decisions of the Ministers of Defense Council in 1992 
were those on the procedure for mutual transfer of servicemen of 
armed forces of Commonwealth states (Moscow, 3-4 September 
1992), on rules for flights of CIS military aircraft (Moscow, 
3-4 September 1992), on establishing the CIS Combined Armed 
Forces Chiefs of Staff Committee and committees of the CIS 
Combined Armed Forces High Command, and on approving the Statute 
on Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Combined Armed 
Forces/Representatives of Armed Forces of Commonwealth States 
(Moscow, 4 November 1992). 
  The activity of the Ministers of Defense Council clearly 
demonstrates the desire of CIS heads of state not only to 
preserve the mechanism of armed forces cooperation, but also to 
improve its functioning as a very important element ensuring the 
security of Commonwealth states. 
  Thus the package of documents adopted in Minsk, Alma-Ata and 
Kiev essentially determined basic parameters of collective 
security within the Commonwealth framework. The Collective 
Security Treaty signed in Tashkent in May 1992 concretized its 
features and opened up favorable prospects for joint, 
coordinated resolution of the full diversity of major defense 
problems. The Treaty was initialed by six states--Armenia, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation, Tajikistan and 
Uzbekistan. 
  Certain CIS member states which did not sign the Treaty 
argued this as follows. Ukraine and Belarus did not do so 
because of their declaration of neutrality and consequently 
nonparticipation in any kind of blocs. Azerbaijan and Moldova 
are inclined to establish bilateral relations with Commonwealth 
countries. Turkmenistan favors only bilateral relations in the 
military-political area. 
  The military security concept of CIS member states adopted 
in 
Bishkek on 9 October 1992 became the substantive part of the 
collective security system. This is the first document 
reflecting coordinated, officially adopted views on protecting 
against external threats and ensuring independence and political 
stability. Member states pledged not to undertake unilateral 
actions violating provisions of the concept and to take its 
basic provisions into account in following a military policy and 
developing and adopting legislative instruments in matters of 
defense, including also in forming national military doctrines. 
  The prevention of conflicts and resolution of disputes among 
CIS members themselves became a new direction of joint activity 
in the collective security area. Instability in a number of CIS 
areas and the increase in conflicts in some Commonwealth states 
led to the appearance of the idea of establishing a legal basis 
for regulating this problem. At the meeting of heads of state in 
Kiev (March 1992), Kazakhstan President N. Nazarbayev raised the 
question of the need for establishing a mechanism for preventing 
inter-ethnic conflicts in the CIS. In his opinion, multinational 
forces of the Commonwealth could become a means which would bar 
the development of bloody events. 
  The Declaration of Non-Use of Force or Threat of Force in 
Mutual Relations Among CIS Member States was adopted (Kiev, 20 
March 1992). In it, in addition to confirming previous 
obligations, CIS members announced the nondelivery of weapons to 
zones of conflicts and the stopping of attacks on military units 
and installations for seizing weapons; pledged to refrain from 
organizing or encouraging the organization of irregular armed 
units, including those made up of mercenaries; pledged to 
encourage various forms of people's diplomacy and public 
initiative to avert the threat of interstate conflicts; and 
pledged to support efforts of the international community and 
its institutions to settle conflicts on territory of 
Commonwealth states. 
  The Declaration cites a detailed list of nonmilitary 
(political) measures to be used for fair resolution of disputes 
among Commonwealth states: 

  -  negotiations; 
  -  investigation; 
  -  mediation; 
  -  reconciliation; 
  -  arbitration; 
  -  legal proceedings. 

    It also was proposed to use principles, provisions and rules 
of another nature developed by the United Nations and CSCE. 
  The Declaration on the Situation in Left-Bank Areas of the 
Republic of Moldova also became important in this connection; it 
emphasized CIS interest in preserving Moldova's territorial 
integrity and promised to take steps against involvement of 
mercenaries from the CIS in the conflict, against the supply of 
weapons to opposing sides, and against conduct of propaganda in 
the mass media promoting an escalation of the conflict. 
  The decision of the Heads of State Council, made at the 
request of Azerbaijan and Armenia, on its resolve to send a team 
of observers and collective peacekeeping forces to the Karabakh 
conflict zone after a cease-fire agreement was reached between 
them there also was confirmation of readiness for political 
cooperation within the CIS framework. 
  The CIS Charter registered in a concentrated form the 
provisions of basic documents in the security area adopted in 
the CIS during 1991-1992. 
  In it the member states affirmed that they are following a 
coordinated policy in the area of international security, 
disarmament, arms control and armed forces organizational 
development and are maintaining security in the Commonwealth. In 
accordance with the Charter, use of military force, including 
peacemaking operations and use of armed forces if necessary, is 
done together in case a threat arises to the sovereignty, 
security and territorial integrity of one or more member states 
or to international peace. 
  Every Commonwealth member state which signed the Charter 
pledged to take appropriate steps to ensure a stable situation 
on external borders of Commonwealth member states and to 
coordinate the activity of border guard troops and other 
services responsible for compliance with the established 
procedure for crossing external borders of CIS member states. 
  The Charter also includes questions of preventing conflicts 
and resolving disputes. The parties agreed to take all steps to 
prevent conflicts, above all on an inter-ethnic and 
interconfessional basis; to refrain from actions capable of 
harming other member states and leading to exacerbation of 
possible disputes; to make efforts for peaceful resolution of 
disputes through talks or by achieving an understanding about an 
appropriate alternative procedure for settling a dispute. 
  An analysis of approaches to collective security in the CIS 
shows that involvement of the independent countries in military 
and defense cooperation is expressed in various forms. Six 
states parties to the Collective Security Treaty make up the 
nucleus of collective military-political cooperation. CIS 
founding states which ratify the Commonwealth Charter within a 
year can be added to them. A considerable number of 
military-political questions concerning not only division of the 
USSR's legacy, but also creation of a foundation for 
military-political relations on a new basis are decided by the 
Ministers of Defense Council and Chiefs of Staff Committee. 
Military-political ties are developing on a bilateral basis. 
Thus, multilevel military-political integration and diversity of 
forms and methods of cooperation in the security area are 
showing up more and more clearly. 
  Our own history knows such forms of military cooperation as 
military-political coordination of objectives and positions of 
allies, strategic interworking of independent armies, 
operational subordination of national troops to a unified 
command, tactical communications and interworking of military 
force elements, and organizational unity of the performance of 
duty by soldiers of different countries. Essentially all these 
forms are manifested in or are being put into the activity of 
Commonwealth states. The diversity of interstate ties leads to 
the appearance of different schemes of military-political 
leadership, but all of them presume the generally recognized 
principles, objectives, and missions of states parties to the 
CIS. 
<H5>  Part 3 - Objectives and Principles of Military Cooperation </H5>
  Military cooperation of CIS member countries presumes a 
closeness or coincidence of their national interests which 
contributes to unification of efforts in the defense area, 
including a joint assessment of military danger, formation of 
objectives and principles of defense organizational development 
and military cooperation, and mutual obligations in the area of 
ensuring security. 
  Experience built up by the CIS in the time of its existence 
indicates that the dividing up of armed forces and the entire 
defense infrastructure permitted laying down foundations for 
national armed forces. Simultaneously there was an abrupt slump 
in the level of troop combat readiness, defense capability, and 
internal and external security of independent states on the 
whole. It is obvious that sovereignty represents no more than a 
declaration without reliable assurance of internal stability and 
external security. The reality is such that in the foreseeable 
future essentially not one Commonwealth state will be able to 
ensure its own security individually, independently of each 
other, above all the military-economic, military-technical and 
strictly military aspects of such security. It is not just that 
effectiveness of isolated defense and security systems that rely 
exclusively on national resources, needs and interests hardly is 
attainable in principle under contemporary conditions; it also 
is wasteful and irrational and is so burdensome on the economy 
of a state just getting on its feet, especially a small one, 
that it may undermine and block its movement along the path of 
democratic transformations and progress. 
  Life persuasively showed the CIS states that their genuine 
independence can be guaranteed only by establishing a solid 
economic alliance and a collective military security system, 
within the framework of which it would be possible to resolve 
defense problems common to all, beginning with military 
legislation, technical outfitting and training of national 
armies and combined armed forces and ending with legal and 
social protection of servicemen and their families. 
  Fundamentals of a common military security system were laid 
down by the Collective Security Treaty signed by the heads of 
six CIS states--Armenia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan--at a Tashkent meeting on 15 May 
1992. 
  The draft of this document was introduced for consideration 
by Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Initially its content was 
prepared only for these three states within the framework of 
friendship and mutual assistance treaties. Later the collective 
security idea was supported by other CIS members. 
  The Treaty represents a political and legal basis for 
forming 
a defense alliance of independent Commonwealth states. Its 
parties confirmed basic principles of their foreign policy. 
After emphasizing the desire to live in peace both with each 
other as well as with other states, they undertook to refrain 
from using force or threat of force in interstate relations and 
from joining military alliances or taking part in any kind of 
groupings as well as in actions directed against another member 
state. The readiness of states parties to the Treaty to change 
the content of the document in case of the establishment of a 
unified security system on the Euro-Asiatic continent as part of 
a worldwide system attests to the peaceful and defensive 
direction of the Treaty and the desire to ensure not only 
regional, but also global security. 
  The Treaty proceeds from the fact that in case of the 
appearance of a threat to security, territorial integrity and 
sovereignty of one or more member states, or a threat to 
international peace and security, the mechanism of joint 
consultations will begin to operate for coordinating positions 
and taking steps to eliminate the threat at hand. A Collective 
Security Council made up of the heads of member states and the 
CinC CIS Combined Armed Forces is established for these 
purposes. The Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces High Command 
coordinates the activity of armed forces of member states until 
Council bodies are established. 
  Collective defense obligations of the parties make up the 
heart of the Treaty. All member states agreed to consider an 
armed attack on one as aggression against all. In this case each 
member state will take steps to assist the country which has 
come under attack. This corresponds to Article 51 of the UN 
Charter, in accordance with which each state has an inalienable 
right to individual or collective self-defense until the 
Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain 
international peace and security. The decision on use of armed 
forces for repelling aggression is made by the heads of member 
states. The Treaty does not preclude the possibility of using 
armed forces outside the territory of member states, but 
presumes that this can be done exclusively in the interests of 
international security, in strict conformity with the UN Charter 
and legislation of member states. 
  The Treaty does not affect rights and obligations under 
other 
bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements in force 
concluded by member states with other states, nor is it directed 
against third countries. It is open to all states interested in 
acceding to it which share its objectives and principles. Its 
effective period is five years with subsequent extension. It 
enters into force immediately after instruments of ratification 
are surrendered for safekeeping by signatory states parties. 
  Principles of equality, mutual respect and independence, as 
determining factors in mutual relations of states parties, were 
manifested in the desire, rarely fixed legally in treaties, to 
resolve together any questions which arise among them relative 
to interpretation or application of any provision in a spirit of 
friendship, mutual respect and mutual understanding. No less 
important is the fact that not one state which signed the Treaty 
was deprived of its rights in favor of another state and no one 
received any kind of benefits or advantages at another's 
expense. The entire content of the Treaty is aimed at ensuring 
sovereignty and independence of each party through their joint 
efforts. 
  History knows many examples of military cooperation of 
states 
and armies. Its character, forms and content have been quite 
varied in different historical eras, but the vitality of these 
alliances was determined by those objectives for whose 
accomplishment they were established. For Commonwealth member 
states it is not only the historical commonality of their 
peoples, economic and political interdependence, and a unified 
economic space that are unifying, but also defensive missions 
which coincide in terms of objectives, a common military 
heritage and a preserved common military-strategic space. 
  A very important political objective of the Commonwealth is 
to ensure military security of the CIS as a whole and of each 
member individually. This objective also is fixed in the 
military security concept adopted in Bishkek on 9 October 1992 
and signed by states parties to the Collective Security Treaty. 
  The concept sets forth coordinated views on defense of 
Commonwealth member states against external threats and on 
assurance of their independence, territorial integrity and 
political stability. The concept includes fundamentals of 
military policy and collective defense of Commonwealth member 
states, including basic principles of their nuclear policy and 
of the organizational development and evolution of the 
Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces. It reflects the commonality 
of security objectives and is based on fundamental provisions of 
documents adopted by heads of Commonwealth states on military 
questions and fundamental aims of their military doctrines. The 
concept incorporates provisions on barring wars as the main 
direction of military-political activity and on the agreement of 
member states that they do not regard a single state or 
coalition of states as their enemy in the political and military 
sense and consider all countries of the world community as 
partners with whom relations must be built on generally 
recognized principles and rules of international law, friendship 
and cooperation. The idea of omnipotence of military force is 
rejected and the future of Commonwealth states is not linked 
with military resolution of international problems. 
  In developing policy in the military security area, member 
states proceed from the assumption that the threat of a world 
war breaking out with use of nuclear weapons is unlikely. The 
trend toward a diminishing possibility of the outbreak of a 
large-scale conventional war has stabilized. At the same time 
the danger of the outbreak of various military and other 
conflicts and of local wars on their basis remains. There also 
are a number of potential dangers connected in part with outside 
support to forces whose actions may be aimed at undermining CIS 
solidarity; with proliferation of nuclear and other kinds of 
mass destruction weapons and their delivery vehicles; with 
international terrorist acts connected above all with the arms 
and drug trade, which may serve as the cause of armed conflicts; 
and with the unresolved nature of internal problems and 
political and social instability in some Commonwealth states. 
These dangers may be aggravated significantly by outside 
intervention in internal affairs of Commonwealth member states. 
  CIS member states consider the following to be basic sources 
of military danger: from the standpoint of 
intentions--instability of the socioeconomic and 
military-political situation in a number of regions; from the 
standpoint of capabilities--the presence of powerful combat 
groupings of strategic offensive forces, ground troops, and air 
and naval forces in contiguous and other states whose combat 
potential, despite planned reductions, remains sufficient to 
view it as an important potential military threat to 
Commonwealth security. The possibility of proliferation of 
nuclear and other kinds of mass destruction weapons in the world 
represents a constant danger to CIS member countries. 
  In the more distant future the level of military danger will 
be determined by a global regrouping of forces, the outlines of 
which are visible as a result of the dynamics of political, 
economic, cultural-ethnic and military-technical development of 
the United States, Japan, China, India and Russia; creation of a 
unified Europe; and formation of new states in the European East 
and in Asia. A change in the assessment of the nature of 
military danger is possible in this period. 
  A fundamental feature of the military security concept lies 
in a precise delimitation of ways, methods and means of 
implementing military policy in peace and wartime. 
  In peacetime Commonwealth efforts are aimed at ensuring a 
phased reduction (limitation) of military threats and 
strengthening stability in the CIS and the world; and at taking 
steps to prevent wars between states and civil wars from 
breaking out and to raise the level of confidence and openness 
in the military area. In solving these problems Commonwealth 
member states intend to proceed from the priority of exclusively 
peaceful, conciliatory means in settling controversial problems, 
international crises, and regional and local interstate military 
conflicts; from the need to exclude from practice all forms of 
discrimination and economic or any other methods of pressure; 
and from the need for taking consistent, effective steps to 
fight international and internal terrorism and safeguard human 
rights. 
  Repelling aggression from outside and inflicting such damage 
on an aggressor in defense of the freedom, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of states belonging to the Commonwealth 
that would force him to stop military operations become the 
Commonwealth objective in wartime. 
  In relations with each other Commonwealth member states 
intend to act on the basis of mutual recognition and respect of 
state sovereignty, the inalienable right to self-determination, 
and the principle of equal rights, and they reject use of 
military force or threat of force as a method of achieving 
political, economic and other objectives. They take into account 
that under present conditions any local conflict may lead to 
catastrophic consequences both on a regional as well as a global 
plane. 
  The set of principles forming the basis of the military 
security concept includes above all recognition of the need to 
preserve peace as a priority value. In this connection 
Commonwealth member states are full of resolve to comply with 
adopted declarations on sovereignty and acts on independence, 
they guarantee inviolability of existing borders and 
nonintervention in internal affairs of other states, and they 
intend to apply efforts toward nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons and other kinds of mass destruction weapons as well as 
their delivery vehicles. 
  The principle of non-first use of military force is no less 
important. Commonwealth member states proclaimed resolve never 
to be first to begin military operations against any state under 
any circumstances if they themselves do not become the targets 
of armed attack. The pledge on non-first use of nuclear and 
other mass destruction weapons also was confirmed. 
  The principle of collective security is becoming a very 
important principle of ensuring national-state security for CIS 
countries. Two aspects are singled out in this regard: the 
priority nature of collective decisions and measures for 
ensuring military security of Commonwealth member states; 
assistance in strengthening international security systems and 
adjusting cooperation in political and military matters with the 
North Atlantic Alliance and other alliances and with all 
countries of the world community; and involvement in 
international actions carried out in accordance with the UN 
Charter. 
  The intention to ensure strategic stability in the world by 
political and military methods is a principle of extraordinarily 
great importance for shaping the Commonwealth's 
military-political course. This signifies a desire to achieve 
that state of military-political relations where not one party 
should have any incentives to initiate combat operations against 
another party or to develop new, major programs or acquire arms 
in order to avoid a situation unfavorable to itself. 
  The intention of Commonwealth member states to reliably 
ensure their defense capability along paths of organizational 
development both of the armed forces of an individual country as 
well as of the Combined Armed Forces within limits of reasonable 
sufficiency is linked directly with ensuring stability at an 
international level. This is to be done by acting in three 
directions: 

  -  by using nuclear deterrence, which should be accomplished 
by the minimum potential of Commonwealth strategic nuclear 
forces necessary for this objective and, with implementation of 
the START I Treaty, by the Russian Federation; 
  -  by retaining a sufficient potential of their own armies for 
defense and forces to avert local conflicts on external 
Commonwealth borders; 
  -  by having the opportunity to localize in regions in a short 
time any manifestations of instability connected with operations 
of illegal force elements representing a threat to peace. 

    In the area of ensuring internal security, relying on the 
priority of peaceful means to resolve controversial problems, 
Commonwealth member states intend to continue to develop and 
implement coordinated practical steps on a bilateral and 
multilateral basis aimed at establishing within the CIS 
framework an atmosphere of peace, stability and confidence among 
states, and localization of internal threats and, in case armed 
conflicts arise on their basis, aimed at terminating them 
rapidly and bloodlessly. 
  Conflicts which have arisen on an interconfessional, 
inter-ethnic and political basis on territory of any 
Commonwealth state are to be settled or they are to be prevented 
by using military observer teams and collective peacekeeping 
forces in the CIS. 
  A component part of the CIS military security concept is a 
set of views on collective defense. The defensive direction of 
these views is determined by the fact that they are based on the 
following provisions: 

  -  rejection of first initiation of military operations and 
of establishment of large-scale troop groupings in peacetime for 
conducting offensive operations; 
  -  excluding any kind of military measures and actions of a 
preventive nature aimed at achieving military advantage before 
aggression is committed; 
  -  strict compliance with UN principles, human rights, treaties, 
agreements and other international acts on nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons, on disarmament, and aimed at maintaining peace 
and security; 
  -  openness of the content of doctrinal documents; 
  -  possibility of creating effective mechanisms for peacetime 
monitoring of military activities. 

    Missions of the Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces are 
determined based on the following fundamental provisions: 

  -  need for preserving peace; 
  -  non-first use of military force and nuclear weapons; 
  -  observance of the right of each Commonwealth member state to 
use its own armed forces in accordance with international 
treaties and agreements for restoring peace in various regions; 
  -  nonintervention in internal affairs of other countries; 
  -  openness of military-political activity; 
  -  advance preparation of troops (forces), territory and 
population; 
  -  unified technology for manufacturing arms and military 
equipment; 
  -  establishment of troop groupings and a unified air and 
aerospace defense system; 
  -  maintaining constant readiness to employ nuclear weapons. 

    Missions of the Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces in the 
area of collective defense include the following: 

  -  preventing war by nuclear deterrence of a potential enemy; 
  -  providing timely information about imminent aggression and 
maintaining high combat readiness of alert forces and assets and 
of battle management and support systems; 
  -  warning of the beginning of a missile attack on land, at sea, 
in the air and in space; 
  -  repelling a surprise aerospace attack and defending the 
principal administrative-political and industrial centers and 
other important installations; 
  -  repelling an enemy attack from land, sea and air, holding 
very 
important areas of CIS territory and routing enemy groups which 
have invaded; 
  -  compelling the enemy to terminate combat operations and 
mopping 
up in the aftermath of aggression; 
  -  weakening the enemy military-economic potential; 
  -  keeping and restoring peace together with armed forces of 
other 
states in accordance with international treaties and the UN 
Charter; 
  -  assisting the population in mopping up in the aftermath of 
catastrophes and natural disasters. 

    Political objectives of a possible war and specific missions 
for conducting military operations, above all in its initial 
period, are the basis for planning use of the Commonwealth 
Combined Armed Forces. The Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces 
above all prepare for retaliatory actions based on the defensive 
direction of military policy of Commonwealth member states, 
which rejects use of force or threat of force for resolving any 
controversial international problems including armed conflicts, 
as long as the territory of any Commonwealth sovereign state is 
not subjected to direct aggression. This provision relates to 
the beginning of warfare. After aggression has been committed 
they are oriented toward choosing forms and methods of warfare 
which must correspond to the situation at hand and ensure 
seizing the strategic initiative and defeating the aggressor. 
Therefore the Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces must be ready 
to conduct defensive, offensive and other kinds of combat 
operations with any variant of the initiation and conduct of war 
under conditions of the use of contemporary and advanced weapons. 
  There is a procedure for performance of combat missions by 
strategic forces using nuclear weapons only in retaliatory 
actions, and by Aerospace Defense Troops within the scope of the 
combined aerospace defense system of Commonwealth member states. 
The Aerospace Defense Troops, which include air defense and 
missile-space defense systems and Aerospace Forces, are called 
upon to provide timely warning of an air, missile and space 
attack, protection of unified air space borders, most effective 
employment of armed forces of Commonwealth member states, and 
cover for state and military command and control facilities, 
troops, reserves and the most important 
administrative-industrial and other installations. Employment of 
air defense and missile-space defense troops and forces is to be 
organized throughout CIS territory under a unified concept and 
plan. The air defense system is structured on a territorial 
principle with precise division into zones and areas. Use of the 
Aerospace Forces is accomplished on treaty terms with 
Commonwealth member states on whose territory they are stationed. 
  The Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces and armed forces of 
Commonwealth member states are in readiness to conduct all kinds 
of combat operations (defensive or offensive) in any variant of 
the initiation of war (armed conflict, local war, large-scale 
conventional war, nuclear war). They can be used fully or 
partially. 
  The CIS Combined Armed Forces and armed forces of 
Commonwealth member states must be thoroughly trained for joint 
performance of missions in the unified military-strategic space. 
<H5>  Part 4 - Organization of Multilateral Cooperation in the CIS </H5>
  The problem of organizing cooperation among CIS member 
states 
is of special importance by virtue of the special form of 
association they proclaimed: the Commonwealth is neither a state 
nor a suprastate formation. In this connection the very first 
agreements fixed the intent to accomplish interworking on the 
principle of equal rights through coordinating institutions 
formed on a parity basis. 
<H5>  4.1. The Commonwealth Coordinating Bodies </H5>
  The Heads of State Council and Heads of Government Council 
became coordinating bodies in accordance with the Provisional 
Agreement dated 30 December 1991. The Ministers of Defense 
Council was added to them in February 1992, and the CIS Combined 
Armed Forces High Command in March 1992 (Diagram 2). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-005LC-28A>           Diagram 2 - Supreme CIS bodies </FIG>





    The powers of these bodies were extremely broad in the 
period 
of existence of the former USSR's Armed Forces as a unified 
body. Under the Agreement on Powers of Supreme CIS Bodies in 
Defense Matters signed 20 March 1992 by Armenia, Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation, Tajikistan and 
Uzbekistan, their essence reduced to the following. 
  The Heads of State Council was recognized as and 
is the supreme Commonwealth body in defense matters. Its terms 
of reference included development and implementation of 
Commonwealth military policy; determination of the collective 
defense concept and basic directions of military organizational 
development; adoption of Commonwealth military doctrine and 
nuclear strategy; development of the decisionmaking procedure 
for use of nuclear weapons, a system of measures precluding 
their unsanctioned use, and the procedure for exercising unified 
control over nuclear weapons and other kinds of mass destruction 
weapons; determination of the amount of appropriations of 
material-technical resources for defense and upkeep of the 
Combined Armed Forces; determination of the Combined Armed 
Forces makeup and structure and establishment of the procedure 
for performance of military duty in the Combined Armed Forces; 
and approval of plans for development, mobilization and 
employment of the Combined Armed Forces in wartime. 
  In accordance with the Agreement on Powers, the Heads of 
State Council makes decisions on instituting and cancelling 
martial law throughout Commonwealth territory in case of 
aggression or threat of aggression against the Commonwealth; on 
declaring war, terminating a state of war and concluding peace; 
and on conducting military operations; and other decisions on 
the most important defense matters. Decisions of the Heads of 
State Council are made on a consensus basis. 
  As fixed in the Agreement on Powers of Supreme CIS Bodies in 
Defense Matters, the Heads of Government Council 
coordinates military-economic activity. In accordance with the 
situation which existed in the spring of 1992 it was determined 
that the Heads of Government Council submits the Commonwealth's 
draft unified defense budget to the Heads of State Council; 
draws up, together with the Combined Armed Forces High Command, 
a coordinated program for arms and military equipment 
development for the Combined Armed Forces for the corresponding 
period; draws up the amount of financing of the indicated 
program within limits of appropriations for defense and upkeep 
of the Commonwealth Combined Forces and priorities for 
fulfilling military orders; establishes the procedure for 
accepting arms, military equipment and other military property 
for the Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces into the inventory 
(for supply, for operation) and the procedure for logistic 
support of the Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces; determines 
the procedure for accomplishing RDT&amp;E in the defense area; 
through appropriate bodies of independent states, provides for 
outfitting the Combined Armed Forces with arms, military 
equipment and other supplies and for providing them with 
necessary services; coordinates annual contingents of citizens 
subject to call-up for military service in the Combined Armed 
Forces and the annual number of militarily trained specialists 
subject to training and refresher training; draws up 
mobilization plans for the national economy and plans for 
stockpiling materiel resources of the mobilization reserve; 
establishes assignments for preparation and transfer to the 
Combined Armed Forces of means of transportation, communications 
and other resources with the declaration of mobilization and in 
wartime, and other mobilization assignments; makes decisions on 
establishment (retention), development and the procedure for 
using defense installations and lines of communication, 
communication networks and transportation on territory of member 
states in support of collective defense, and also the command 
and control system in the Combined Armed Forces; makes decisions 
on matters of social and legal guarantees and monetary, 
material, housing/everyday services and pension support for CIS 
Combined Armed Forces servicemen, persons discharged from 
military duty and members of their families, as well as families 
of servicemen who perished (died) in performance of official 
duties. 
  Functions of the Ministers of Defense Council are 
considered further on in the text. 
  The transition from organizational development of CIS 
Combined Armed Forces based on unified armed forces to their 
organizational development based on establishment of national 
armed forces, which led to signing of the Collective Security 
Treaty, contributed to the appearance of a draft establishing 
the Collective Security Council. In fulfillment of 
the Collective Security Treaty, heads of states parties to the 
Treaty approved the Statute on the Collective Security Council 
at a session of the Heads of State Council in Moscow on 6 July 
1992. The Statute specified that the Council is the supreme 
political body of states parties to the Collective Security 
Treaty and it provides for coordination and joint activity of 
member states for fulfilling the given Treaty. 
  The primary form of Council activity consists of sessions, 
which are held as necessary, but at least twice a year. Special 
sessions are convened at the request of at least two Council 
members. Council members possess equal rights in making 
decisions. Council decisions are made in accordance with 
regulations established individually for each session, and they 
enter into force for each member state in accordance with its 
constitutional procedures. 
  The Council includes heads of states parties to the 
Collective Security Treaty and the CinC CIS Combined Armed 
Forces. 
  A General (Executive) Secretary of the Council is appointed 
from among civilians by decision of the Collective Security 
Council, and the CinC Armed Forces of States Parties to the 
Collective Security Treaty also is appointed by decision of the 
Collective Security Council; performance of his duties can be 
assigned to the CinC Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces. 
  The Statute specifies powers of the Collective Security 
Council General Secretary, among which is holding political 
consultations and coordinating positions on military matters 
with Council member states; chairing Collective Security Council 
sessions; and proposing questions for discussion and decisions. 
In addition, the General Secretary represents the Collective 
Security Council in relations with heads of state, international 
organizations and the mass media and, upon Council 
authorization, represents general interests in coordination and 
cooperation with NATO and other military-political groupings, 
blocs and alliances; provides political assistance and 
organizational help in establishing and strengthening national 
armed forces of Collective Security Council member states; and 
directs the work of the Council Secretariat. 
  The Statute on the Collective Security Council specifies its 
powers. It considers questions connected with ensuring 
fulfillment of the Treaty; holds consultations to coordinate the 
positions of member states in case of the appearance of a threat 
to security, territorial inviolability and sovereignty of one or 
more member states or a threat to peace and international 
security; develops measures for upgrading defense management of 
member states; examines questions of granting necessary aid, 
including military aid, to a member state which has been 
subjected to aggression on the part of any state or group of 
states; establishes and takes steps which it shall find 
necessary for maintaining or restoring peace and security; 
coordinates the activity of member states along basic directions 
of mobilization preparation of armed forces and economic 
structures; develops recommendations on basic directions of 
military-technical policy and outfitting of armed forces of 
member states with arms and military equipment. 
  It is apparent from the list of these powers that in 
accordance with the Statute on the Collective Security Council, 
it is assigned a portion of the functions which previously were 
to be assigned both to the Heads of State Council and to the 
Heads of Government Council. 
  The CIS Combined Armed Forces High Command came out with the 
initiative of supplementing the military structure (the High 
Command proper) with a political structure coupled closely with 
it, i.e., realizing the concept contained in the Statute of 
creating a political part of the Council in the person of a 
political leader. This means that the General (Executive) 
Secretary of the Council would be elected and would be 
responsible for conducting military policy on behalf of and upon 
authorization of the Collective Security Council, and the CinC 
CIS Combined Armed Forces would focus on organizing the 
functioning of the Combined Armed Forces. It is also proposed to 
change the makeup of the Collective Security Council by 
including in it not only heads of state, but also heads of 
government, chairmen of the Ministers of Defense Council and 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs Council, and the General 
(Executive) Secretary. 
  Possible coordination of efforts of CIS states in the 
military-political area is shown in Diagram 3. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-005LC-31A>           Diagram 3. Possible makeup of </FIG>





    As indicated above, the Collective Security Council was 
signed by six states. The Statute on the Collective Security 
Council is in effect from the moment the Collective Security 
Treaty enters into force. In case other states accede to the 
Treaty, their heads are included in the Council without any kind 
of additional procedures. It is indicative that the Statute on 
the Collective Security Council was signed not only by 
representatives of Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, 
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, but also Belarus, Moldova, 
Turkmenistan and Ukraine. 
  Adoption of the CIS Charter and results of the meeting of 
heads of state in May 1993 became an important stage in forming 
the structure of multilateral cooperation in the CIS. 
  The interrelationship of Commonwealth coordination bodies in 
accordance with the CIS Charter and documents of the 14 May 
Moscow meeting are shown in Diagram 4. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-005LC-32A>           Diagram 4. CIS coordination </FIG>





    The Heads of State Council was confirmed by the 
CIS Charter as the supreme body of the Commonwealth. It has been 
determined that the Heads of State Council, in which all member 
states are represented at the highest level, discusses and 
decides fundamental questions connected with member states' 
activity in the sphere of their common interests, i.e., 
questions of cooperation in the area of defense policy and 
security of external borders. 
  The CIS Charter specifies that the Heads of State Council 
assembles for sessions twice a year. Special sessions of the 
Council may be convened at the initiative of one of the member 
states. 
  Under the Commonwealth Charter, the Heads of Government 
Council coordinates the cooperation of member states' 
executive authorities in economic, social and other spheres of 
common interests. Thus, the defense sphere is not especially 
singled out here, although military-economic questions obviously 
are impossible to decide without the heads of government. 
  It is proposed that the Heads of Government Council assemble 
for sessions four times a year. Special sessions of the Council 
may be convened at the initiative of the government of one of 
the Commonwealth member states. 
  The Charter specifies the procedure for decisionmaking by 
the 
Heads of State Council and Heads of Government Council: 
decisions are made by common consent, by consensus. It is 
important to note here that any state may declare its 
impartiality in a particular matter, which should not be viewed 
as an obstacle to decisionmaking. 
  The Heads of State Council and Heads of Government Council 
may hold joint sessions. Both councils may establish working and 
subsidiary bodies both on a permanent as well as an interim 
basis. 
  Statutes on the Ministers of Foreign Affairs Council, 
Ministers of Defense Council, Council of Commanders in Chief of 
Border Guard Troops and the Coordination-Consultative Committee 
became important organizational aspects of the CIS Charter. 
  The Ministers of Foreign Affairs Council is a body 
which coordinates foreign policy activity of member states based 
on decisions of the Heads of State Council and the Heads of 
Government Council, including their activity in international 
organizations, and which organizes consultations in matters of 
world policy representing mutual interests. 
  In contrast to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs Council, the 
Ministers of Defense Council and Council of Commanders in Chief 
of Border Guard Troops are bodies of the Heads of State Council. 
  The Ministers of Defense Council is responsible 
for questions of military policy and military organizational 
development of member states. The Combined Armed Forces High 
Command exercises direct leadership of the Combined Armed Forces 
(see below for more detail on these bodies). 
  The Council of Commanders in Chief of Border Guard 
Troops is responsible for questions of security of external 
borders of Commonwealth member states and assurance of a stable 
situation on them. 
  Establishment of the Coordination-Consultative Committee and 
the Secretariat under it as envisaged in the CIS Charter took 
shape in the course of the 14 May 1993 Moscow meeting of heads 
of state as the establishment of somewhat different structures. 
According to the CIS Charter, the Committee develops and makes 
proposals on questions of cooperation within the Commonwealth 
framework and of development of socioeconomic ties; promotes 
realization of understandings in specific directions of economic 
relationships; organizes conferences of representatives and 
experts for preparing draft documents to be submitted for 
sessions of the Heads of State Council and Heads of Government 
Council; supports sessions of the Heads of State Council and 
Heads of Government Council; and assists in the work of other 
Commonwealth bodies. 
  In accordance with a decision of the Heads of State Council 
of 14 May 1993, not a Coordination-Consultative Committee, but a 
Consultative-Coordination Committee of the Councils of 
Heads of State and Heads of Government of the CIS is being 
established. The Committee is assigned functions of coordinating 
the activity of economic regulation in member countries, 
interstate coordination of economic reforms, and documentary 
formalization of the process of establishing an economic 
alliance. The Committee consists of vice premiers of interested 
Commonwealth states. The post of Committee chairman is occupied 
on a rotating basis by representatives of member countries. 
Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin has fulfilled duties of 
chairman for the first six months in 1993. 
  At this same meeting of heads of states members of the 
Commonwealth, the Working Group of Councils of Heads of State 
and Heads of Government was reorganized as the CIS 
Executive Secretariat, an independent body whose functions 
include both preparing materials for sessions of councils of 
Heads of State and Heads of Government as well as collecting 
information on fulfillment of decisions adopted. Ivan 
Korotchenya was appointed CIS Executive Secretary. 
  In accordance with the CIS Charter, an Economic 
Court was established, operating to ensure fulfillment of 
economic obligations within the Commonwealth framework. Its 
purview includes resolution of disputes arising in fulfillment 
of economic obligations. The Court also may decide other 
disputes coming under its purview by agreement of member states. 
Belarusian Minister of Justice Leonid Dashuk was appointed 
president of the Economic Court. 
  Based on agreement of Commonwealth member states about 
cooperation in the economic, social and other areas, 
bodies of branch cooperation may be established which 
develop coordinated principles and rules of such cooperation and 
promote their practical realization. Bodies of branch 
cooperation (councils, committees) perform functions prescribed 
in the CIS Charter and in statutes on them, ensuring 
consideration of and a decision on questions of cooperation in 
appropriate areas on a multilateral basis. The bodies of branch 
cooperation include heads of corresponding executive authorities 
of Commonwealth member states. Bodies of branch cooperation 
adopt recommendations within limits of their terms of reference, 
and in necessary cases also submit proposals for consideration 
of the Heads of Government Council. 
  Activity within the framework of the Interparliamentary 
Assembly is one of the most important directions of 
cooperation in the CIS. The Agreement on the Interparliamentary 
Assembly was signed in Alma-Ata on 27 March 1992 at a 
consultative meeting of heads of supreme soviets (parliaments) 
of CIS member states. The parties approved the Assembly as a 
consultative institution for discussion of a wide range of 
political and socioeconomic questions and for consideration of 
draft documents of common interest. 
  Section VII "Interparliamentary Cooperation" of the CIS 
Charter specifies powers and forms of activity of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly. Article 36 notes that the 
Interparliamentary Assembly conducts interparliamentary 
consultations, discusses questions of cooperation within the 
Commonwealth framework, and develops joint proposals in the 
sphere of activity of national parliaments. 
  Three plenary sessions of the Interparliamentary Assembly of 
CIS member states were held: in Bishkek during 15-16 September 
1992 and in St. Petersburg during 28-29 December 1992 and on 23 
May 1993. 
  According to Regulations adopted in Bishkek, the 
Interparliamentary Assembly consists of parliamentary 
delegations. Delegation heads form the Interparliamentary 
Assembly Council, which carries out practical organization of 
its work. It was decided to hold routine plenary sessions at 
least twice a year. 
  The Interparliamentary Assembly forms permanent or interim 
commissions and other bodies from among representatives of 
parliamentary delegations for preliminary consideration and 
preparation of questions coming under its purview. Decisions are 
made in the form of declarations, addresses, recommendations and 
proposals which the Assembly sends to the Heads of State Council 
or Heads of Government Council. 
  Working bodies of the Interparliamentary Assembly also have 
been formed. A Council was established and its chairman elected. 
Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet, became the chairman. 
  Five permanent commissions--legal matters, economics and 
finances, social policy and human rights, environmental 
problems, and security matters--are called upon to be important 
working bodies of the Interparliamentary Assembly. 
  St. Petersburg was specified as the residence of the 
Interparliamentary Assembly. 
  According to results of the first plenary session in 
Bishkek, 
the Interparliamentary Assembly adopted a declaration on social 
protection of citizens, approved the Basic Directions for 
Convergence of National Legislation, deemed it advisable to 
begin drawing up recommended legislative measures, approved the 
Provisional Statute on the Interparliamentary 
Information-Reference Service, and addressed international 
parliamentary organizations with a proposal to establish and 
develop broad cooperation. Special addresses were adopted in 
connection with the difficult situation in Tajikistan and 
Abkhazia. 
  At the second plenary session of the Interparliamentary 
Assembly in St. Petersburg, pressing questions of the 
development of cooperation of Commonwealth states were 
considered and important decisions were made. On questions of 
strengthening cooperation in the defense area, the Assembly 
deemed it necessary to implement agreements in this area and 
draw up legal foundations of military organizational development 
in Commonwealth states, as well as to prepare proposals for 
increasing the defense capability of CIS countries. 
  At the third plenary session the Interparliamentary Assembly 
adopted a block of recommended measures on political, economic 
and humanitarian matters. Among measures of a recommended nature 
adopted at the session were decrees on general principles of 
legal regulation of customs affairs and foreign investments, on 
regulating information relations, and on fighting organized 
crime. The memorandum "On Accord for the Sake of Security" was 
adopted in which Assembly participants called on parliaments of 
CIS countries to refrain from supporting separatist approaches 
in political and economic development of states. 
  Decrees were adopted in the military area on increasing 
defense capability, on cooperation, and on convergence of 
military legislation of CIS member states. The 
Interparliamentary Assembly addressed a proposal to all 
Commonwealth parliaments to make changes to legislative measures 
of their states and allow servicemen to continue to serve 
temporarily in other Commonwealth member states on the basis of 
bilateral agreements up to the year 2000. 
<H5>  4.2. Bodies Supporting Military Cooperation </H5>
  Multilateral cooperation of CIS member countries in the 
military area is carried out by two principal bodies, the 
Ministers of Defense Council and the Combined Armed Forces High 
Command (Diagram 5). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-005LC-35A>           Diagram 5. Organization of </FIG>





    The Ministers of Defense Council was formed in 
February 1992. In accordance with the decision made at that 
time, the Ministers of Defense Council was specified as the 
supreme collective body of the Heads of State Council in matters 
of defense policy and military organizational development of 
member states. Development of conceptual approaches to ensuring 
defense, proposals on the Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces 
organizational structure, and the procedure for Combined Armed 
Forces manpower acquisition were specified as among the most 
important functions of the Ministers of Defense Council. 
  The functions and prerogatives of the Ministers of Defense 
Council are specified by the CIS Charter and the Statute on the 
Ministers of Defense Council signed 22 January 1993. It includes 
ministers of defense (chairman of defense committee) of 
Commonwealth states and the CinC and Chief of Staff of the CIS 
Combined Armed Forces. 
  According to Article 30 of the CIS Charter the Ministers of 
Defense Council is a body of the Heads of State Council in

decision of the Commonwealth Heads of State Council and also at 
the proposal of at least one-third of the membership of the 
Ministers of Defense Council. 
  The Nuclear Policy Committee, the Statute on which 
was adopted in November 1992, is a collective working body of 
the Ministers of Defense Council. The Committee includes a 
chairman--CinC CIS Combined Armed Forces; deputy chairman--chief 
of staff of the CIS Combined Armed Forces; members--ministers of 
defense of Commonwealth states on whose territory nuclear 
weapons are stationed; and a secretary--chief of operations

international understandings with respect to strategic nuclear 
forces, and so on. 
  Functioning of the Combined Armed Forces High 
Command is regulated by Statute and was placed into force 
by a Protocol signed by heads of Commonwealth states parties to 
the Collective Security Treaty of 9 October 1992. The Statute 
specifies the international law status of the High Command, its 
bodies and officials. 
  Its fundamental structure includes a command element made up

preparation of documents for sessions, conferences and other 
measures conducted by the Combined Armed Forces High Command and 
the CIS Ministers of Defense Council. 
  The High Command structure may undergo substantial changes 
in 
connection with upgrading of the collective security system and 
with a change in status and missions of coordination and command 
and control bodies. 
<H5>  4.3. International Military Cooperation </H5>
  The CIS Combined Armed Forces High Command performs a number 
of functions in the area of international military cooperation. 
As a permanently operating interstate coordinating working body 
of military command and control of the Heads of State Council, 
the CIS Combined Armed Forces High Command organizes and 
accomplishes interworking with state bodies and structures, 
military command and control bodies, international organizations 
and military-political alliances, and the mass media in the 
interests of strengthening mutual understanding and trust, 
developing cooperation, and fulfilling international obligations 
in the disarmament and security area. 
  Basic directions of this activity are connected with 
realization of decisions of Commonwealth leadership bodies on 
preventing war, maintaining stability and peace, using 
peacemaking forces, and creating reliable global, regional and 
national security mechanisms. 
  The focus of the High Command's attention is on questions of 
maintaining working contacts and broadening spheres of 
interworking with command and control bodies of national armed 
forces of Commonwealth member states and their official 
representatives. It has become a daily practice to mutually 
inform appropriate subunits and officials of the High Command, 
Combined Armed Forces Staff, ministries of defense (defense 
committee), staffs of armed forces of CIS states, and permanent 
representatives of these states on the Combined Armed Forces 
Staff (as of 1 July 1993 there were representatives of Armenia, 
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation, Tajikistan 
and Uzbekistan on the Combined Armed Forces Staff in the 
position of deputy chiefs of staff of the CIS Combined Armed 
Forces). Permanent representatives take part in sessions of the 
Chiefs of Staff Committee, Ministers of Defense Council and 
other measures. With their participation, a "roundtable 
discussion" was held in the High Command in March 1993 on 
problems and prospects of creating and upgrading the 
Commonwealth military security and collective defense system. 
  Permanent representatives take a direct part in preparing 
working documents for holding talks and signing multilateral and 
bilateral military cooperation agreements among Commonwealth 
states. 
  The CinC and other military officials of the CIS Combined 
Armed Forces regularly meet with ambassadors and senior 
diplomatic officials of Commonwealth member states accredited to 
the Russian Federation. During such meetings officials of 
diplomatic missions are informed of the views and positions of 
the High Command leadership on pressing problems and prospects 
for development of a collective security system and development 
of the Commonwealth Combined Armed Forces in international 
security structures on a regional and global scale. 
  Ambassadors of Commonwealth states in turn have an 
opportunity to set forth their views and vision of problems that 
arise and exchange opinions on matters of mutual interest. 
  Such meetings promote clarification and convergence of 
positions on matters relating to terms of reference of the High 
Command and to a strengthening of interworking and mutual 
understanding between political and military structures of 
Commonwealth states. 
  A methods conference of the leadership of these subunits 
held 
in the High Command in May 1993 laid down the foundation for 
further expanding the sphere of interworking and cooperation 
between external relations subunits of ministries of defense 
(defense committee) of CIS states and corresponding bodies of 
the High Command. It promoted the development of coordinated 
approaches to solving problems of military-diplomatic and 
representative activity under contemporary conditions. 
  Agreement was reached on holding regular conferences, 
working 
meetings, seminars and other measures with the involvement of 
representatives of external relations subunits for exchanging 
practical work experience in the area of development of 
international military cooperation, coordination of plans and 
programs, exchange visits along military lines, and training of 
officers traveling abroad as military attaches and their 
assistants. 
  In the period of the formation of armed forces in the CIS, 
cooperation in the external relations area with corresponding 
bodies of ministries of defense of Commonwealth states which do 
not yet have their own permanent representatives on the Combined 
Armed Forces staff is accomplished through officials of 
diplomatic missions accredited in the Russian Federation who are 
charged with handling military matters. 
  Realization of High Command initiatives for developing and 
deepening cooperation in the external relations area creates 
preconditions for a further joint search for ways of 
interworking which would help most to conclude basic measures 
for strengthening national armed forces of Commonwealth states 
and for jointly developing both the principles of forming and 
the mechanisms of using peacemaking forces, as well as 
developing conceptual approaches to building an effective 
collective security system. 
  Organizing contacts and ties with political, diplomatic, and 
military circles outside the Commonwealth, above all the United 
States and its North Atlantic Alliance allies, is a very 
important direction of High Command activity for developing 
external relations. Creation of CIS military and 
military-political structures drew fully natural interest after 
disintegration of the Warsaw Pact Organization and USSR and 
formation of the CIS. This interest extends to the objectives, 
missions, functions and organizational structure of the Combined 
Armed Forces High Command, limits of its powers and of its 
responsibility in the area of nuclear weapons control, and 
principles of CIS Combined Armed Forces organization, 
operational alignment, and interworking with the Commonwealth 
member states' national armed forces being established. 
  The radical change in the international situation was 
reflected in decisions of the December (1991) and then May 
(1992) NATO Council sessions, which marked the beginning of 
profound, large-scale restructuring of relations of CIS states 
with the North Atlantic Alliance and its member countries. 
Working meetings, press conferences and briefings during which 
foreign representatives were given maximum possible information 
regarding the full spectrum of problems and questions connected 
with creation and functions of the High Command and CIS Combined 
Armed Forces promoted a reciprocal movement toward establishing 
relations of partnership, openness and mutual respect. 
  Within limits of established powers and of certain 
additional 
functions of a political nature acquired because of the 
situation at hand, the High Command essentially was the only 
working body of the Heads of State Council for a certain period. 
It was in that capacity that it organized and performed its 
military-diplomatic activity. Legislative documents regulating 
this activity, including basic directions of the High Command's 
external relations, functions of corresponding subunits, and 
procedure for working with foreign military representatives 
accredited to the CIS Combined Armed Forces High Command, were 
developed in parallel. 
  The High Command Treaty and External Relations Sector and 
the 
Public Information Center were specified as High Command working 
bodies for supporting external relations. These bodies 
coordinate their practical activity with the Commonwealth 
Ministers of Defense Council Secretariat. 
  High Command accreditation of military representatives of 
foreign states from among military attaches assigned to those 
states' embassies in the Commonwealth was instituted by decision 
of the CIS Ministers of Defense Council to regulate the High 
Command's evolving contacts with the leadership of armed forces 
of foreign states and military-political alliances, to transfer 
them to a planned long-term basis, and to elevate the High 
Command's international law status. It does not affect the 
status, privileges and immunities of foreign military 
representatives nor give them a more favorable regime of 
presence in CIS states. 
  Within limits of its powers, the High Command is advancing 
initiatives and acting as an instrument for developing dialogue 
and partnership between the CIS and distant foreign states and 
military-political alliances. 
  Working meetings of Commander in Chief Marshal of Aviation 
Shaposhnikov with representatives of the supreme military 
leadership of NATO (Supreme Allied Commander Europe General J. 
Shalikashvili, Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic Admiral P. 
Miller and others) served to activate relationships of the CIS 
Combined Armed Forces High Command and NATO and confirmed that 
many coinciding viewpoints are seen in the parties' assessments 
and approaches. This goes for the situation taking shape in 
Europe and in the world, its development prospects, and 
possibilities of deepening international military cooperation 
and establishing a regional and global collective security 
system. 
  Meetings with WEU leaders, ministers of defense of a number 
of North Atlantic Alliance member states (United States, France, 
Norway, Denmark), and representatives of the U.S. Congress and 
the Norwegian Parliament were mutually beneficial. An expansion 
in the spectrum of such meetings, which are being held more and 
more often not only at the level of leaders, but also at the 
level of military attaches, working groups from NATO 
Headquarters, specialists in peacemaking operations, experts, 
officer associations, representatives of international relations 
institutes and so on, represents an unquestionably positive 
trend. 
  Development of external relations both in the area of 
cooperation with management bodies of ministries of defense 
(defense committee) of CIS member states and in the direction of 
building relations of partnership, equal rights and mutual 
advantages with distant foreign states will hold an important 
place in strengthening international stability, creating a CIS 
collective security system and ensuring its integral 
interrelationship with other international security systems and 
structures.
