<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Lashkevich, IZVESTIYA: "Lithuanians Will </F>
Calculate Incomes and Declare Them for the State"] 
  [Text] Possibly, as early as next year, all of the 
residents of Lithuania will begin to declare their property and 
incomes. This is the aim of a draft law that Lithuanian 
President Algirdas Brazauskas has submitted for consideration to 
the Lithuanian Seimas. 
  Thus, in Lithuania, perhaps, for the first time in the 
legislative practice of former republics of the USSR, it is 
planned to fundamentally change the system of taxation, which 
will be the most radical decision in the reformation of the 
socioeconomic life of the republic. 
  According to the presidential draft, all adult residents of 
the republic will be obliged to declare property acquired and 
incomes received in the course of a calendar year by submitting 
special declarations to state tax inspectorates according to 
place of residence. It will be necessary to submit them there by 
1 March of the next year for the past year. So that each 
resident of Lithuania, whether he wants to or not, will have to 
become a domestic bookkeeper who scrupulously gathers all 
records, forms, checks, tickets, receipts, and other payment 
account documents that are of use to him in filling out the 
declaration. If it is filled out incorrectly then, according to 
the draft law, the tax inspectorate first reports this to the 
taxpayer and, in the event of insufficient payment of taxes, he 
is obliged to pay them now with an added fine. Its sum will 
increase in that progression in which the taxpayer tries to 
deceive his own state. Moreover, for evading submission of a 
declaration, and for indicating incorrect data, he can end up in 
court. 
  Members of the ruling parliamentary faction and the 
Democratic Labor Party decided to work to support the 
presidential draft law--they announced their intentions to 
declare their incomes that they received this year. President A. 
Brazauskas earlier also declared his readiness to fill out such 
a declaration and to publish his incomes. The president and his 
team thereby let it be known that the presidential veto of the 
law on mandatory declaration of incomes and property by state 
employees, previously adopted by the Seimas, is explained not by 
a desire to please corrupt bureaucrats, of which the rightist 
opposition accused the president, but by an urgent need to 
defend the constitutional rights of citizens. A. Brazauskas 
decided: If incomes are to be declared, then this is for all 
residents, and not for an individual category of workers. 
  This kind of reform of the taxation system will undoubtedly 
require large resources and a radical breaking of the 
consciousness of the people. 
  The foundation for a Lithuanian-style tax revolution has 
been 
laid. Lithuania has already adopted the law on the declaration 
of incomes of residents and on expensive property that was 
acquired or is being acquired. The Seimas will soon consider the 
draft of a new law about a single income tax, according to which 
it is proposed to summarize all incomes and to give the state 35 
percent of the aggregate. If such a document is adopted, then it 
will not be necessary to rack one's brain over the compilation 
of a declaration--in fact, a single tax standard will be in 
operation. In addition, it is planned to introduce 16 types of 
taxes in Lithuania: on real estate, land, natural resources, 
patents, notary services, and so on. It is planned to complete 
the Lithuanian tax system as early as 1996.

<F P=106> [Article by Lise Tajik: "EU Fund Closed to Small Projects in </F>
the Baltics"] 
  [Text] The EU [European Union] fund for small and minor 
business projects in the Baltics has been depleted. The money 
has been spent on the creation of advisory centers, and new 
funds will not be appropriated until the middle of 1995. 
  There will be no new initiatives financed by the EU in the 
three Baltic countries for a year and a half. 
  The EU fund in support of small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SME) in the Baltics has been completely depleted, and no more 
funds from this particular section of the PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program will become 
available until the middle of 1995. 
  The money has been swallowed up in the establishment of 
business advisory centers in the three Baltic countries, and 
there is not a red cent left for more down-to-earth programs. 
<H5>  Procedure Results in Problems </H5>
  The Council of Artisans welcomes the idea of advisory 
centers, but finds it alarming that the EU fund for SME has been 
depleted. 
  However, it is not only the missing millions that the 
Council 
finds disturbing. Another problem is PHARE's very bureaucratic 
appropriation process. 
  Only projects that the receiving countries themselves apply 
for are given support. This benefits only government interests 
in the Baltics to the detriment of private projects, among 
others those enterprise-to-enterprise programs, on which the 
future business structure in the three Baltic countries has been 
based. 
  Another difficulty is the fact that, after revising the 
Danish support arrangements for East Europe, one stresses the 
importance of linking these to international sources of 
investment. 
  In this way, small and medium-sized enterprises have been 
let 
go because they do not have a chance in the world of competing 
with the big ones in getting their share of international funds. 
<H5>  Large Grant to Poland </H5>
  The PHARE program has set aside ECU230 million between 1990 
and 1992 for development of small and medium-sized enterprises 
in East and Central Europe. Of this, only ECU9 million have gone 
to the three Baltic countries -- corresponding to 3.75 percent 
of the total amount -- while about 40 percent -- ECU9 million 
has been spent on SME projects in Poland. 
  The total PHARE program for East and Central Europe was 
granted ECU1 billion (almost 8 billion kroner) in 1993, and a 
similar amount has been set aside for 1994. The PHARE 
appropriations, consisting of a combination of professional aid 
and financial support, is spent on: 
  --Changeover and privatization of government businesses. 
  --Support for the private sector, especially small 
businesses.%Modernizing of financial systems. 
  --Development of a social safety net.

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Yevgenyev: "The Establishment of </F>
Interstate Bank Marks the First Step Toward an Economic Union"; 
first paragraph is introductory paragraph] 
  [Text] Bankers from national banks of the CIS countries met 
in Moscow to discuss the future structure of a financial 
community. 
  The Central Bank of Russia held a three-day seminar with the 
participation of the International Monetary Fund and the 
European Political Research Centre in order to organize an 
interstate bank. 
  The interstate bank is meant to be a supranational structure 
for effecting settlements between the CIS countries for state 
deliveries. In the course of discussions the participants which 
included representatives of central banks of the Commonwealth 
countries became distinctly aware that the interstate bank will 
either never get off the ground or will require participant 
countries to reform their financial systems. 
  The decision on the formation of the interstate bank with 
its 
headquarters in Moscow was discussed for several years and was 
made last autumn. All members of the future bank agreed that its 
main function would be to deal with interstate trade. The 
present system of state payments between the CIS countries does 
not suit most of them since sums for exported goods are entered 
to accounts of enterprises of the CIS countries in Russian 
commercial banks. (The exporters of the "near abroad" countries 
regard the ruble as a relatively hard currency.) Bankers believe 
that the flight from national currencies to the rouble does not 
help stabilize other soft currencies, encourages the leakage of 
capital and causes the shortfall in taxes. State agencies are 
interested therefore in changing the order of interstate 
settlements. 
  Ironically, the seminar was prepared by specialists of the 
International Monetary Fund and conducted by the Central Bank of 
Russia. The interstate bank still has no office, equipment and 
staff. (It is true that it has received a contribution from 
Russia of 2.5 billion roubles, which is half of the total. The 
contributions of other participants vary depending on their 
share in interstate trade.) But this arrangement is quite 
justified since the choice of the bank's model will determine 
the methods of solving several problems of principle which are 
not directly connected with its activity. For example, the 
experts of the International Monetary Fund discovered on the 
very first day of the seminar that, although the colleagues from 
the CIS countries showed interest in the subject, they were on 
the whole sceptical. It became clear from subsequent talks that 
their doubts stemmed not from the bank's model but from the 
conditions in which it will have to be implemented. The 
interstate bank can be considered stillborn if a single 
settlement mechanism is applied to countries with different 
currency, monetary and licence rules. The participants in the 
meeting became distinctly aware of the necessity of the 
unification of several conditions, which is, alas, beyond their 
competence. 
  Russia, which has a positive trade balance, can painlessly 
change over to a new system of interstate settlements. The 
situation of Turkmenistan is also quite satisfactory. The other 
states have debts to repay for which they will need credits. 
Sources of credit are needed and debts must be formalized. 
Specialists from national banks admit that countries find it 
difficult today to separate the debts of states from those of 
individuals. Thus most countries will be in a quandary because 
of the changeover to the new system which does not allow 
arbitrary crediting. When the debt exceeds the established limit 
the account of the participant country in the interstate bank 
can be blocked, which means that payments will be frozen and 
trade will stop. The debtor state will then have to sell part of 
its hard currency reserves in order to cover the debt balance. 
The changeover to a system of settlements through the interstate 
bank will also mean for most CIS countries the automatic 
introduction of compulsory 100 per cent sale of proceeds in hard 
currency since clearing settlements between countries will be 
done in roubles and with the final clients in their own national 
currency. (It may be noted for comparison that Kazakhstan has 
until recently practised 30 per cent compulsory sale of hard 
currency. The exporter kept 70 per cent of the total, which was 
often kept abroad.) The deportation of exporters' money home, 
especially in national currency, can hardly be welcomed by them. 
  The establishment of the interstate bank should, according 
to 
the intention of the contracting countries of the former USSR 
conclude the first stage of a new economic union. During the 
second stage they plan to form a payments union for countries 
which cannot satisfy the current conditions to enter the 
interstate bank. Settlements between the participants in the 
payments union will be also effected in roubles which will be 
considered the reserve currency. 
  The uncoordinated market rules in the various former union 
republics make it difficult to establish a payments system 
similar to the European one. It is entirely unclear now, at the 
first stage what goods will be entered in the list of state 
deliveries, whether they will be licensed, whether the system of 
settlements through correspondent accounts in commercial banks, 
practised until now, will be preserved, and how rates of 
exchange will be coordinated. The European payments system 
presupposes, for instance, a mechanism to regulate exchange 
rates (introduction of a fixed rate of exchange) with a 
permissible deviation of plus-minus one. But in order to 
introduce such a system all states participating in the union 
should possess adequate currency reserves for supporting the 
fixed rate of exchange by means of currency interventions in the 
market. Most CIS countries have insufficient reserves of hard 
currency. If the rate of exchange is established freely, through 
a currency exchange or an auction, it should cover all deals 
concluded in the country and not be divided into official and 
black-market rates. It should not be forgotten, above all, that 
the elaboration of a currency policy is a state matter and that 
banks are totally powerless to change the rules of the game. 
  In any case the establishment of an interstate bank would 
shorten the time required for payments and their guarantee. 
  At the same time the interstate bank will not work if the 
rules of the game in the countries participating in the union 
remain uncoordinated. Since suppliers find it better to live 
"under the old regime" it will evidently be necessary to 
introduce bureaucratic checks as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Agricultural Sciences Dzhurakul </F>
Sattarov, director, Institute of Soil Science and Agrochemistry, 
corresponding member of the Uzbekistan Academy of Sciences: "The 
Tired Land: Scientists Sound the Alarm"] 
  [Text] These are difficult, anxious times we're living 
through, as you know. A time of political disputes, internecine 
warfare, economic discord, a time in which practically every 
republic has shut itself off into its own compartment, 
introduced its own currency, and is experiencing mountains of 
unaddressed economic and social problems. When will we learn to 
understand and be sensitive to one another? But the main 
question troubling me as a scientist and a person in this 
whirlpool of contradictions is this: What is going to happen to 
our life-giving land? 
  To be honest, even when we were still living as "one family" 
we didn't tend it very zealously. But now the situation has 
worsened, and all science, and especially agrarian science, has 
been given a very low priority. This can be said not only of the 
republics of Central Asia but also of Russia and Ukraine. 
  Let me dwell on a particular comparison confirmed by data of 
our institute covering many years. By scientifically improving 
the land, eliminating many of the extremes of land reclamation, 
and introducing more productive varieties we could increase the 
productivity of cotton by 600,000-700,000 tonnes. That's how 
much two oblasts produce today. But cotton isn't the only 
concern, after all. Imagine this: As many as 22 million persons 
already live in Uzbekistan, on a territory of a little more than 
450 square kilometers, a sizable part of which is occupied by 
deserts and semideserts. 
  The population is growing, its annual increment has averaged 
half a million, and the fields that are supposed to give us 
grain, vegetables, fruits, milk and meat are the same size as 
before, while in many places their area has decreased 
dramatically due to growth of cities. If we use these fields 
more intensively, which means applying more mineral fertilizers, 
herbicides and pesticides, we would be ruinously contaminating 
and destroying the soil. There's something to think about here. 
  The main problems of the land today can be determined by 
looking at it in three dimensions. The first--its fertility, the 
ability to provide the greatest return per irrigated hectare. 
The second--ecology, the ability not only to feed man but also 
preserve the surrounding beauty, and civilization's natural 
lungs--the forests and the rivers. Third--the social side, 
uniform distribution of productive forces, reasonable 
construction of cities and towns on the land, so that all 
interests of the people would be accounted for. To be honest, 
this is not a simple task. But it is something we need to do. 
  As far back as in the 1960s scientists of our institute 
developed the concept of the fertility of irrigated soil, and 
carried out major soil improvement operations in regions of 
future development. These were mainly the Karshinskaya, 
Dzhizakskaya and Sherabadksaya steppes, the Fergana Valley, and 
the lower reaches of the Amu-Darya. It was then that a means was 
found for growing high cotton yields in the conditions of a 
desert zone: Scientists proposed creating an optimum soil 
density by sowing plants on previously prepared ridges and 
seedbeds, which increased the yield by 4-6 centners per hectare. 
  Much was done to study and regulate the hydrologic and 
thermal cycles of different soils. And in recent years research 
was started on thermophysical characteristics of soil. 
More-sensible means of improving desert soil were found, and 
plants promoting swift recultivation of land were tested. 
However, soil erosion, to which over 700,000 hectares of land 
fit for use are subjected in Uzbekistan, remains a serious 
problem to farmers. Imagine how much food could be obtained from 
this land in the presence of an acute shortage of plowland! 
Taking on this problem, scientists developed and introduced 
agrotechnical systems into production for controlling gully 
erosion on irrigated land and the means of laying out and 
cultivating gullied and unproductive land. But while developing 
even a good recommendation is one thing, getting to the fields 
is another. This is the task of the business executives, but 
sometimes they are simply powerless in the acute contradictions 
of a market economy. There are not enough resources, equipment 
or materials. But even under these conditions I feel that we 
need to do everything we can to improve the land. Because 
without it, it would be impossible to raise agricultural 
potential or solve ecological and social problems. 
  It would be worthwhile here to consider one other important 
point. When we lived in the Union, summary soil maps of river 
basins and certain large regions--the upper and lower reaches of 
the Amu-Darya, the Zeravshan and the Syr-Darya--were prepared. 
That is, the area of not only Uzbekistan but also Tajikistan, 
Turkmenia and Kyrgyzstan was covered. With our division into 
national compartments it has become very difficult, and 
sometimes impossible, to concentrate energy on carrying out 
common tasks and monitoring their fulfillment. All that remains 
here is to wish that in pursuing important political and 
economic objectives the leaders of neighboring states would 
remember that they are living together on the same land, and 
they need to take care of it together. 
  Talking about the present day, here's something else that 
needs to be said. While in the 1920s-1930s land development 
proceeded slowly because of the limited availability of 
technical resources and the needs of those times, in recent 
decades the scale of development increased by several times. 
Intensive development and introduction of irrigated farming were 
carried on, however, without regard for soil conditions in each 
particular locale. As they say, we worked under the same 
yardstick--getting as much from every hectare, whatever the 
cost. Incompetent handling of the land led to degradation of the 
soil, growth of the area of salinized land, exhaustion of the 
total reserves of organic matter, worsening of the physical 
properties of plowland, and its contamination by heavy metals, 
pesticides and herbicides. As a result the productivity of the 
land fell, and its ecology found itself at a critical point. 
  Today, dependable means of improving the land are being 
sought. The "Soil" republic scientific-technical program has 
been developed. Considering that the ecologically most serious 
situation has evolved here in the lower reaches of the 
Amu-Darya, we started implementation of this program with 
Karakalpakstan. Here of course the problem has to do not only 
with soil but also with water, and with social reconstruction, 
brought on by the sharp drop in the level of the Aral Sea. That 
has meant thousands of tons of extra salt chased by the winds, 
and even change in climate. But we have selected a specific task 
for ourselves. Specialists of different profiles working in the 
institute have begun integrated study of the soil surface of 
Karakalpakia and detailed mapping of its soil. After the 
scientific work is finished, recommendations will be provided on 
what specific crops would best be cultivated on different types 
of land, with regard for its ecological and ameliorative 
condition. 
  In the future such work is planned for all of Uzbekistan. 
You 
will have to agree this is an enormous amount of scientific 
work, which will require many years. But people of the rural 
areas can't wait--they need serious scientifically substantiated 
farming procedures today, tomorrow. They have to feed and clothe 
the people. 
  Many have become accustomed to thinking that nature 
reproduces or restores itself. But that's not so. Today even 
short-term action by man upon the environment is such that it is 
comparable to the consequences of geological, geochemical and 
other global processes spanning many millions of years. A 
graphical example of this is the hundreds of ruined settlements 
in Central Asia. Today they have become historical monuments, 
museums beneath the open sky. You can be sure that not only the 
hordes of Genghis Khan and other conquerors are to blame for the 
disappearance of oases. Nature has not forgiven man his 
mistakes, and his indifferent attitude. Springs feeding the 
rivers have dried up, and the land has lost its former fertility. 
  When we ponder our history, we recall that there was a time 
when the Sahara was a rich land, and Hannibal caught elephants 
for his army in the forests of North Africa. According to 
statistics each year around 50 million hectares of fertile land 
in the world are transformed into desert. That's a fact that 
catches your attention. While we grieve for the land that is 
abandoning man, he is doing little to bring its goodness and 
generosity back.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Shumakov, academician of the Russian </F>
Agricultural Academy, and Aleksandr Kolganov, deputy minister of 
the Russian Ministry of Agriculture: "Is a Rainbow Over the 
Fields Something Necessary?"] 
  [Text] It has already been over a decade that certain 
scientists, writers and journalists have been carrying out a 
massed offensive against land reclamation policy. First on the 
scale of the former USSR, and now in Russia. As a result the 
USSR and RSFSR ministries of land reclamation and water 
resources were utterly devastated, followed by the USSR Ministry 
of Water Management Construction and the Vodstroy State Concern. 
The sector has been practically eliminated in Russia itself. The 
Main Administration of Land Reclamation and Water Resources, 
which has survived under the Ministry of Agriculture, the 
Vodstroy Joint-Stock Company and the Rosselkhozvodstroy and 
Tsentrinzhselstroy corporations now unite water management 
construction and planning organizations only on a voluntary 
basis. 
  Moreover, it was found that in comparison with other 
sovereign states that formed atop the ruins of the great 
country, the Russian Federation has the smallest percentage of 
reclaimed agricultural land (11.5 million hectares, to include 6 
million hectares irrigated and 5.5 million hectares drained). 
But not only has this foothold not enjoyed any growth in the 
last 3 years, it has even decreased by more than 1.2 million 
hectares. This has been due to indiscriminate abandonment of 
reclaimed land as a result of higher taxes on it and continually 
growing operating expenses. Things can get worse--the need for 
financing all reclamation work only out of local budgets has 
recently been pondered intensively in government circles. If 
such a policy is adopted, in the next 3 to 5 years Russia's 
reclaimed land will be practically eliminated. 
  The natural question that arises is this: Does Russia need 
such land anyway? Could it be that the need for it was 
substantiated by ignorant scientists and specialists who saw 
only personal gain in the development of land reclamation? 
  Let's look at history to get a dependable answer. According 
to available documents, development of land reclamation in 
Russia goes back more than four centuries, while planned 
irrigation and drainage did not begin here until the last 
century, in the reign of Nicholas I. A hundred years ago the 
Department of Land Improvement, the first state body dealing 
solely with the problems of land reclamation, was established in 
the Ministry of Agriculture. At that same time, at the end of 
the last century, large expeditions were organized under the 
leadership of famous specialists and scientists such as I. P. 
Zhilinskiy, M. N. Annenkov and V. V. Dokuchayev. As a result 
irrigation and drainage systems that were large for those days 
appeared in different corners of the country. 
  We can divide the Soviet era into a prewar period of 
peoples' 
reclamation projects, when a number of large systems were 
created in Central Asia and Russia, and two postwar periods--up 
to 1953 and after 1960. At that time land reclamation was 
carried out practically in all regions of the former USSR, but 
to the greatest extent in republics such as Uzbekistan, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Azerbaijan, 
Ukraine, Belorussia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. It must be 
said that there were failures as well, due to inadequate 
justification of some projects. These mistakes led to secondary 
salinization, swamping and overdrainage of part of the land, 
exhaustion of springs, and the advent of the Aral ecological 
crisis. 
  In Russia itself, irrigation was developed in the Northern 
Caucasus, along the Volga and in Western Siberia, while drainage 
projects were carried out in the Nonchernozem Zone of the 
European territory and in Siberia. The relatively small amount 
of reclaimed land has until recently provided for the production 
of 100 percent of the rice, 80 percent of the vegetables and 80 
percent of rough fodder. In other words the contribution to 
agricultural production has been substantial. 
  Returning to the question raised in the article's title, 
let's now consider the experience of highly developed foreign 
countries. 
  The 15th International Congress on Irrigation and Drainage 
was held in September 1993 in The Hague, with 80 countries 
participating. For the first time in the last 30 years, Russia 
was not officially there as the successor to the former USSR. 
Sad, but true. 
  It was noted in the general report given by John Hennessy, 
president of the International Commission on Irrigation and 
Drainage, that irrigation and drainage remain the sole 
dependable means of stabilizing and intensifying agricultural 
production in the 21st century, providing for execution of the 
food program of developing countries. This was the road traveled 
in the past by the United States and Germany. Reclaimed land now 
makes up over 60 percent of agricultural land in these 
countries, while in the Netherlands it is as much as 80 percent. 
This is believed to be the optimum ratio here, and there are no 
plans for increasing the area of reclaimed land in the next 5-10 
years. On the other hand emphasis is now being laid on the work 
of operating and rebuilding existing systems, raising their 
ecological safety and reducing their energy-intensiveness. 
Developing countries must make use of the modern technical level 
of reclamation to carry out their food programs. 
  The congress examined two questions. The first concerned 
establishment of systems of a new generation distinguished from 
former ones by their ecological safety and resource-conserving 
nature. This means economical use of both natural (land, water) 
and economic (capital-intensiveness, energy-intensiveness, 
metal-intensiveness etc.) resources. 
  The second question had to do with the forms of financing of 
reclamation work. It was noted that in all developed and 
developing countries investments are financed both by the state 
budget (70-80 percent) and with assets from municipalities and 
farm associations. Moreover construction of water intakes, 
reservoirs, major canals and pumping stations is proceeding only 
at the expense of the state budget, while projects at the farms 
themselves are financed both by the state budget and with assets 
of the farm associations. 
  State low-interest loans are being granted for 
reconstruction 
and reorganization of systems in commercial farms. Then, after 
the client's work is 70 percent completed, loans are paid off by 
the federal government. 
  In comparison with the countries discussed above, Russian 
agriculture is in more complex climatic conditions. The 
country's southern regions are subjected to frequent droughts, 
while the central and northern sections are distinguished by 
excessively wet farmland. This means that experience should not 
be carried over blindly: Our climate and our economic resources 
need to be considered. Simple arithmetic shows that in order to 
establish stable and highly productive agricultural production, 
we need to subject an area of 30-35 million hectares of land to 
reclamation--that's 20-25 percent of all agricultural land. When 
done in integration with other forms of land improvement 
(forest, biological, chemical, erosion control), this can 
successfully solve the problems of producing feed with a 
balanced protein concentration, as well as sugar, vegetables, 
fruits and other valuable food products. 
  But let's be realistic. In today's economic conditions it is 
impossible to consider extensive development of land 
reclamation. Maintaining the land we already have, transforming 
it somewhat in correspondence with the agrarian reform, and 
rebuilding and reorganizing farms must be the priority objective. 
  Russia does of course need reclaimed land! But the kind that 
would have a caretaker, and would support stable, highly 
productive production of ecologically clean products.

<F P=106> [Article by Arpi Totoyan: "Rugged Industry of a Country at </F>
War"] 
  [Text] In its two years of existence, the Nagorno-Karabakh 
Republic [NKR] has been able to accomplish a feat as tough as 
its presence and successes on the battlefield by reviving a 
virtually devastated economy and making it meet the day-to-day 
needs of its fighting people. Such an assertion probably leads 
many people to draw comparisons with the situation in 
Armenia--or at least to enumerate the auxiliary factors. It is 
true that Armenia has played a major role in Karabakh's economic 
success. Also, there is a big difference in the population sizes 
of the two countries: After all the economy of 150,000 people is 
not the same as that of 3.5 million people. While those 
arguments are justified, there is one important point that seems 
to be the real cause of the difference between the two 
situations: the leadership of Karabakh has been more skillful in 
waging the war on the economic front by resorting to more 
radical measures. 
  These are the impressions one obtains from an interview by 
Maksim Hovhannisian, director of the NKR information and press 
agency, with NKR's deputy prime minister Zhirayr Poghosian. The 
interview was published in the 22 December 1993 issue of 
HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN. The deputy prime minister is not 
unfamiliar to the Armenian community of Paris: he accompanied 
Rober Kocharian, chairman of the NKR State Committee for 
Defense, during his visit to France in October. 
  Poghosian describes the state of NKR's economy as follows: 
"Imagine a patient who begins to learn walking immediately after 
a major surgery." Citing figures about the "patient" he says: 
"The republic's more than 60 agricultural enterprises--that is 
nearly a third of our resources--had halted their activities. 
Scores of enterprises and production units had been knocked out 
as a result bombing. Industrial enterprises had completely 
stopped or operated at insignificant levels as a result of 
extremely inadequate means of delivery for raw materials and 
energy." For more tangible evidence, Poghosian cites figures 
from industry which clearly show that the sector, which suffered 
sharp declines from 1988 through 1992, began taking steps toward 
recovery in 1993. For example, the figures cited say the 
following about production of shoes: output declined from 
4,515,000 pairs in 1987 to 189,000 pairs in 1992, but 204,000 
pairs of shoes were produced in the first 7 months of 1993. The 
deputy prime minister says about the initial signs of recovery 
in 1993: "The liberation of Shushi and the opening of the Lachin 
corridor had a critical impact on the course of our struggle for 
survival. The blockade around us slackened somewhat. We started 
getting electrical power from Armenia and enough raw materials 
to utilize our production facilities." 
  There is another element which contributed as much as, if 
not 
more than, the material factor to the economic recovery and 
which accounts for not an insignificant portion of the 
difference between NKR and Armenia. In that regard the deputy 
prime minister's remarks are so rejoicing that they can be cause 
for envy: "The strictest discipline was introduced and all 
persons of any responsibility were mandated to be accountable. 
It became inadmissible to blame any failure on the war. We had 
to live and work in the impossible conditions of war." 
  While figures for the first 7 months of 1993 are quite 
modest 
compared to 1988, what is important is that "there is no 
industrial enterprise in the republic that is not operating." 
Stating that "our economy is definitely on its way to recovery," 
Poghosian enumerates the bases for that confidence. The first 
issue is, as it is not hard to guess, that of energy. Poghosian 
says that this problem should be at least partially resolved by 
the end of the year. He is referring to the hydroelectric power 
plant that has been installed on the Sarsang dam. The plant is 
expected to operate at full capacity, and the electricity it 
generates will be transmitted to Stepanakert, Shushi and other 
regions of the republic. The project was made possible by a loan 
of about 1 billion rubles from Armenia. This appropriate project 
is expected to have dual benefits: not only will NKR stop being 
a burden on Armenia for its energy supplies but also, if 
necessary, some electricity will be transmitted to Armenia. 
  The NKR deputy prime minister explains how this vital issue 
was resolved in war conditions: "In recent years large 
quantities of cargo which was destined for Karabakh and for 
which we had paid was piled up in the train station at Agdam. As 
is known, that cargo became loot for our neighbors. The cargo 
included generators, transmission cable and other materials 
which we used as necessary." 
  Poghosian has interesting remarks about the other important 
prerequisite for industrial production: the supply of raw 
materials. During the Soviet period, Karabakh, like all the 
other republics, oblasts and okrugs had an industrial production 
system that depended on other regions. In other words, no branch 
of industry was self-sufficient. In addition, local resources 
had not been explored. For example, significant reserves of 
clay, which can be used for the manufacture of bricks, tiles and 
terra cotta were completely overlooked. Reserves of construction 
stone and marble were also ignored. Now all these resources have 
begun to be used in the construction of civilian housing and 
roads and for army contracts. The information on this subject is 
complemented by the mention of the Artsakh program of the 
Armenia Fund. That program allocated 1.041 billion rubles to the 
repair of homes and the construction of roads and power 
transmission lines. The same program envisages rebuilding 
completely the highway linking Goris to Stepanakert in 1994. 
  These positive indications naturally do not mean that 
everything is in order and solved. NKR still has many problems 
that await solution and which are not less important or pressing 
than those mentioned above. The agricultural sector needs fuel, 
raw materials for canning, fertilizers and seeds, in particular 
for regions that produce grains. 
  The livestock industry is also in dire straits. Grape 
production has declined. Although grape production accounted for 
60 to 70 percent of Karabakh's income in the past, today only 
31,000 tonnes of grapes can be produced. The main reason is the 
war and the fact that the plains in the Martakert region, which 
produced 60 percent of the grape harvest, are still in enemy 
hands. 
  Asked how the NKR industry meets the needs of the army, 
Poghosian gives the following example in lieu of an answer: "A 
facility to repair tanks and military vehicles has been built in 
one of the factories. That facility meets the needs of the army. 
We must express our gratitude to all the specialists who were 
able to solve complex technical problems in an incredibly short 
time." 
  Despite all the severe hardships, the deputy prime 
minister's 
expectations for the future, together with the encouraging 
information he provides, offer grounds for optimism: "No matter 
what happens we must create an invincible economy: advanced, 
productive and independent."

<F P=106> [Interview with Armenian President Levon Ter Petrosyan by </F>
Yerevan YERKIR correspondent Nayiri Badalian, in Yerevan; date 
not specified; originally published in the 13 December issue of 
Yerevan YERKIR] 
  [Text] This interview with the president came about 
unexpectedly, on the spur of the moment. When our correspondent 
asked the president to comment on the Russian elections in the 
hallway of the parliament on 12 December she did not receive the 
expected comment, but gained a unique opportunity for an 
interview, which was surprising to the correspondent herself. 
  [YERKIR] Mr President, what is your assessment of Armenia's 
socioeconomic and political condition? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] There can be no unequivocal assessment. The 
only unequivocal assessment is that this is a transition period, 
with all of its contradictions and all the instructive elements 
in the process of building a state. The learning applies to the 
government as well as businessmen, the heads of state 
enterprises, our people, the banks and so forth. This is a 
serious issue. 
  [YERKIR] How long may this process last? In your opinion, 
when can this transition period end? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] In my opinion several decades are necessary. 
Of course, it is not necessary that we experience the same 
levels of tension and crisis as those we have now throughout 
those decades, but what is known as "transition," when it refers 
to a radical change from one system to another, must take 20, 30 
or 40 years. This is the experience of all countries in the 
world. 
  [YERKIR] And when can the process of decline be halted and 
when can stabilization begin? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] It is hard to say. One can say that things 
can be worse than this. Things will be worse than this. 
  [YERKIR] Can one conclude from your remarks that no plans 
are 
being made in that direction? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] No, one cannot conclude that. Plans are made 
every day, every second. 
  [YERKIR] Then what do you think is the cause of the current 
situation? Apart from objective causes, what subjective factors 
do you see at the root of this situation? Inadequacy of the 
government system or those who govern? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] I can enumerate dozens of factors. First 
there is the inadequacy of the legislation. I consider that a 
subjective factor, because there are mechanisms to enact laws. 
Here both the government and the Supreme Council have their 
share of the blame. There is also a lack of professionalism in 
general. We are creating a state in new conditions. All of us 
are passing through a process of learning, and everyone has a 
right to err in that process. That is also subjective. The 
president takes decisions, the Supreme Council enacts laws. None 
of these can be turned into dogmas. These decisions and laws 
must be viewed as dynamic documents. We must be able to react to 
them very quickly and correct them as necessary. There is a 
certain sluggishness because of these subjective factors. 
  [YERKIR] Do you observe any mistakes or oversights on your 
part? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] As I said all these subjective factors are 
mistakes. 
  [YERKIR] On your part. 
  [Ter Petrosyan] I spoke about presidential decisions also. 
Why not? 
  [YERKIR] In terms of working in the legislative domain? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] Of course. There have been laws, for 
example, 
whose urgency I did not realize and which I submitted late when 
I could have done so sooner. In particular, the package of laws 
and decisions about privatization. I still think that we moved 
too slowly in that regard. 
  [YERKIR] What serious deficiencies have you noticed in the 
government's work with regard to the socioeconomic situation--if 
any, that is? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] It is impossible to say anything definite. I 
can attribute them to learning, inexperience and the current 
conditions of getting work done in new circumstances. 
  [YERKIR] Do you not think that the relative instability of 
the domestic political situation is the result of the abnormal 
state of relations with the opposition? What steps do you 
envisage taking to strengthen those relations? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] Is the present situation unstable? 
  [YERKIR] Comparatively. In other words, it could be better 
than it is now. 
  [Ter Petrosyan] It can always be better, but we must compare 
our situation with others. 
  [YERKIR] In any event, what steps would you take to move 
closer to the opposition as a first step to improve the domestic 
political situation? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] To move closer to the opposition? I have no 
demands from the opposition. I have no complaints about the 
opposition. The opposition is doing whatever it thinks is 
appropriate. That is why it is the opposition. The opposition 
decides on its own what its actions and policies will be. Let me 
say one thing: For me there is only one standard of appraisal, 
whether it is done by the opposition, the press or the 
government, or whether it is with regard to science or human 
relations: Objectivity. I have no other standards. 
  [YERKIR] Can one conclude from what has been said that you 
think that relations with the opposition are very normal and 
that there is no need for the government and the opposition to 
communicate with or to come closer to each other? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] I would like to emphasize one point further. 
When the press, the opposition or the government are striving to 
see and seek the truth then we have national harmony. If that 
happens they can always communicate with each other. But when 
that desire does not exist, one gets bargaining instead of 
harmony. Bargaining is not excluded in politics. We are not 
opposed to that either. Bargaining does not come about 
artificially but is created by life when real political forces 
are created. Real political forces have to reckon with each 
other, irrespective of whether they like or do not like each 
other. They are simply obligated to reckon with each other. 
  [YERKIR] Do you foresee the creation of a coalition 
government as an alternative? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] Life may mandate that. If life mandates it, 
we can have a coalition government, fresh elections or early 
elections. At this time life does not force us to do that. By 
life I mean political life. 
  [YERKIR] When is the endorsement of a constitution expected? 
Are presidential elections envisaged after that? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] I am the most interested person in the 
endorsement of a constitution as soon as possible, and I am not 
backing off from my terms. I have declared my position 
repeatedly and I stand on it: Immediately after the endorsement 
of a constitution there must be fresh presidential and 
parliamentary elections. 
  [YERKIR] A few days ago, your press secretary, Mr Aram 
Abrahamyan, responding to a question about your address 
preceding the introduction of new currency, said that your 
sources passed erroneous information to you. What do you say 
about that? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] Aram Abrahamyan gave the wrong answer. He 
was 
simply not careful, because the question itself contained 
certain untruths. I do not want to comment on what that question 
implied. You can examine the recording carefully. 
  [YERKIR] I would like you to comment on the problem of the 
"brain drain" from Armenia and the state of the intelligentsia. 
  [Ter Petrosyan] It is no secret that emigration is observed 
in such conditions. It is the war. 
  [YERKIR] However, most of those emigrating are the 
scientific 
and technical intelligentsia. 
  [Ter Petrosyan] I do not agree with that. You give me the 
numbers. What do you mean by majority? Whatever numbers you 
have, please show them to me. 
  [YERKIR] I must concede that I do not have numbers at my 
disposal. 
  [Ter Petrosyan] Then let me give you the numbers. It is true 
that these are not the latest figures; they are four months old. 
When there was much talk about the "brain drain" we commissioned 
the Academy of Sciences to supply us with official information. 
It was determined that 13 members of the Academy left in the 
last two years. I repeat, this was the situation four months 
ago. I am giving the numbers and I am responsible for them. 
  [YERKIR] What steps are you taking to improve the social 
condition of the intelligentsia, in particular the scientific 
and technical intelligentsia? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] I do not separate the condition of our 
intelligentsia from that of our people, that is, our entire 
population. 
  [YERKIR] I mean, does the intelligentsia fall into the list 
of socially insecure classes for whom measures will be taken by 
your upcoming decree on indexation? 
  [Ter Petrosyan] If you paid any attention, in the most 
recent 
decrees on indexation, we tried to put in place a differentiated 
approach with respect to people who work in science, education 
and health care. I agree with the principle that a 
differentiated approach should be taken on the indexation issue, 
and in the future we must try to deepen gradually the 
implementation of that principle. The intelligentsia is included 
in the groups targeted for indexation. What I am saying is not 
speculation. This has been put into practice in the latest 
decrees. 
  [YERKIR] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Narek Mesropyan under the heading "Tight Spot": </F>
"There Is No Alternative! Has There Ever Been?"] 
  [Text] We are, for all that, an amazing people. We were 
constantly complaining that the factor of the absence of 
statehood had over many centuries so strongly influenced our 
minds that we harbored toward all authorities, if not a 
scornful, then at least not exactly a respectful, attitude. 
Gevorg Emin once wrote a poem on this subject: You need to 
operate with care in our parts, he said, because each Armenian 
is a tsar. Not potential. In the literal sense. He meant, 
possibly, our historical past, when there were always too many 
pretenders for the royal throne, and their number would grow 
with menacing speed. 
  And so we lived, lived, and finally lived to see the day 
when 
there are once again very many potential tsars, but the social 
consciousness sees just one on the throne. 
  At all street corners the talk is the same. 
  "Yes, Levon Ter-Petrosyan has not justified the trust. But 
who, pray, could be put in his place?" 
  And after an agonizing search and mental thumbing through of 
all the possible candidates, the conclusion is: There is no 
alternative! 
  To explain this phenomenon by poverty of intellect and a 
servile devotion to a created idol and the traces of the 
totalitarian consciousness is to say nothing, even if the older 
generation of those alive today, which sobbed bitterly the day 
Stalin died, is, of course, very directly related to all these 
phenomena of social behavior. Nonetheless, even they, who were 
once capable of thinking in all seriousness of personal 
assistance to the revolutionary movement of the peoples of 
Africa, could not be lured into a revolution now. 
  And, then, what kind of revolution or radical 
transformations 
or restoration of social justice could be dreamed of by a 
people, 70 percent of whom plainly state, as a sociological 
survey showed, their desire to leave their homeland? And people 
should not be reprimanded for a lack of patriotic spirit here. 
Armenians are leaving not Armenia but Levon Ter-Petrosyan and 
his hapless team, who have made the blessed motherland a segment 
of the seventh circle of hell. Reproaching the emigres would 
mean antedating a curse on ancestors who in the past abandoned 
Ani, which was sold, incidentally, initially to the Byzantines, 
and then, to the Seljuks. 
  Of what alternative could a people which, if they do not 
steal and do not profiteer, have earnings equal to the cost of 
two eggs be thinking? And as for a search for the truth, when 
the voracious survival instinct has begun to speak at the top of 
its voice? 
  Our mentality is such that we seek a possible alternative 
merely among those who have had or who now have at least some 
relationship to power. The earlier ones are out of the question: 
If there are, indeed, potential saviors among them, they are so 
thoroughly concealed that scraping away the camouflage would 
take too much time, which, incidentally, neither we nor they 
have. The president is dispatching the present ones, however, 
with savage economy: Four premiers in less than three years are 
obvious testimony to this. Not to mention all the others who 
come and go, but who never mature to the level of real 
alternative to the president. And real power, meanwhile, is 
concentrated in the hands of people who would never ascend to 
the highest rung of the state hierarchy other than by way of a 
military or police coup. And the more the popular wave 
undermines their reputation, the dearer they become to the 
president's heart. 
  There is nothing new in the leader's attitude toward his 
immediate entourage here, of course. All has been well known, 
unfortunately, since ancient times, in which our country has 
experts enough. As a result an ideology of futility, which is 
harmful for all except those who are assiduously feeding this 
ideology by their actions, is engendered. Thanks to them, we 
have had no alternative in any period of our life, virtually. I 
shall not list by name all the former leaders of Armenia in past 
decades but the older generation would, most likely, confirm 
that not one of them formerly was, seemingly, an alternative, 
but as soon as a new one appeared, the heavens did not open and 
the grass continued to grow, and if there was no bread in the 
stores, it was only for several days. 
  There is, however we all may be fooled in this connection, 
an 
alternative, even when there is no choice.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article under the heading: "As GOLOS ARMENII </F>
Sees It": "`Splendor' and Misery of Bagratyan's Cabinet"] 
  [Text] According to all calculations, it transpires that 
the inhabitants of Armenia will shortly consist of Nakharars 
[feudal lords] alone. And by no means because their number will 
be increased and Nakhararism will emerge by subterranean 
passageway, say. The number of top officials of the state will 
not change. It is simply that no one, aside from them, wants to 
live in this country. Because, as has become clear following the 
recent parliamentary debate, they alone in Armenia have a good 
life, and they will yield this fine life of theirs to no one for 
anything. It is ordained for all the rest under these conditions 
that they either let go of their own volition or clear off home. 
  In terms of the growth of somberness of the forecasts we 
have, it should be noted, broken all world records. A year ago 
it seemed that a million people could at the very least live on 
this land. Now we ourselves are standing amazed at our naivete 
of last year. And not only us. Everyone all around is talking 
about this, and it is only a few Nakharar ministers who disagree 
with this opinion. It is they who will continue to live here, 
consequently. If they remain ministers, of course. 
  The absurdity of such an idea should not come as any 
surprise. People capable of being surprised in this way are 
hardly to be found because our society has lost this capacity 
also. Being surprised means displaying emotions. We, however, 
are for the most part unimputable. Except, of course, those who 
with risible friskiness continue to cling to power. 
  In having ensured by hook or by crook that all ministers 
without exception speak at the parliamentary lectern, Speaker 
Ararktsyan did them a bad turn, I believe. The public at large, 
to whom they are virtually unknown, suddenly gagged on such a 
powerful stream of unprofessionalism, impudent complacency, 
dismissive attitude toward the troubles of their compatriots, 
and ability to unblushingly lie, blackmail, intimidate.... The 
impetuosity of this step was obvious also from its results: The 
Nakharars, summoned to the attack, by no means dispelled the 
oppressive impression remaining following the speeches of 
representatives of the opposition but intensified it even more. 
Not acknowledging even a part of the gravity of what they have 
wrought, the gentlemen of state have become professional 
trouble-bearers not only in the eyes of their political 
opponents but of all of society also. 
  Throughout the civilized world just one thing is required of 
parliament--the timely adoption of laws and efficient 
supervision of their fulfillment. Our members of parliament, 
however, are being set by the government, in the person of its 
ministers, the task of procuring gasoline, speeding up bank 
transactions, effecting barter deals, and, generally, switching 
over entirely to the spheres of activity for whose 
malfunction-free realization ministers are supposed to exist. 
And since the deputies are not doing this, they are not, 
consequently, entitled to criticize those who are strenuously 
creating the appearance of this "doing." 
  The habit of constantly erecting Potemkin villages is 
becoming second nature even in the most critical situations. 
Ministers just about mouthed from the parliamentary platform the 
essentially primitive truth: While you, deputies, are here 
making speeches and forcing us to listen to them, inflation at 
the markets continues its victorious progression. Have done as 
quickly as possible and let us go, get down to business, and 
save the nation. 
  And this is being said to a hall that is constantly 
protesting this influx of members of the government into 
parliament and demanding an end to the stream of monotonous 
maxims of the holders of high office. After all, ministers had 
sufficient time to discharge their direct duties before the 
sitting of parliament! But here it was ascertained that it was 
these two tense parliamentary days that were the cause of all 
the misfortunes that have come crashing down on our heads! 
  Bagratyan led out into the field of battle his entire host 
in 
the manifest hope of winning. He did so at the price of a 
demonstration of the "splendor" and misery of the cabinet he 
heads. Whether he won or not is another matter. The main thing 
is that the population of the republic is the loser.

<F P=106> [Article by Marina Grigoryan under the rubric "Parliament": </F>
"By Bread Alone.... The State Is Not in a Position To Provide 
Anything Else For Us"] 
  [Text] A parliamentary discussion of the outcome of the 
monetary reform, and in essence--of the catastrophic 
socioeconomic situation existing in Armenia, which is being held 
this week, leaves a painful impression. It appears that all 
sides are doing what they are supposed to do: the deputies 
criticize, the government defends itself, the president tries to 
lay the emphases he needs, but the feeling of being at an 
impasse is growing stronger. The issue of the government's 
resignation is not even being raised because everyone 
understands that this is the easiest way out, but not by far one 
that solves the problem. Only on rare, very rare occasions is 
something constructive proposed in individual presentations--a 
majority of speakers do not go beyond noting the current crisis. 
Perhaps this is the most depressing of all. 
  To be sure, our government is still not short on optimism. 
Just as before, it has no intention of acknowledging its 
mistakes. At any rate, Minister of the Economy Armen Yegiazaryan 
stated that all the actions of the cabinet have been correct on 
the whole. He was also the one to rebuke the deputies for 
failing to appreciate how critical a situation is in which it is 
necessary to make decisions literally within two to three days. 
However, the minister is clearly not willing to talk about who 
brought the situation to this level of absurdity. In his 
opinion, now is not the time to respond to the question of who 
is to blame: We will sort that out later. 
  The government views a granting of additional powers to it 
for a period of six months as a way out of this situation. A 
number of draft decisions aimed at stabilizing the dram have 
been submitted to the parliament. In particular, they envision 
criminal liability for trading in foreign exchange, for refusing 
to sell goods for drams, and for selling goods at prices higher 
than those envisioned by the state, the subordination of the 
activities of the Central Bank to the government, etc. Besides, 
A. Yegiazaryan assured us that there is a program of actions 
that will bring about stabilization in the sphere of monetary 
circulation. The minister did not wish to dwell on what kind of 
program that is: "We know what needs to be done, and we will do 
it." The deputies quite reasonably answered that during the 
entire year the parliament has given the "go-ahead" to all the 
government's initiatives, and it is clear to everyone what the 
outcome has been. Can a government that has brought the country 
to the brink of an abyss be trusted? 
  In his brilliant lecture on Monday, Prime Minister G. 
Bagratyan confidently diagnosed events: There is hyperinflation. 
No, the deputies objected, this is an obvious collapse. The 
ministers said that they were doing everything possible. The 
deputies hurled rebukes at them: No, you are professionally 
incompetent. And so on ad infinitum. Frankly, despite the 
sharply critical arrows, this entire exchange at times smacked 
of an undisguised farce in which everyone tries to pretend that 
they are acting seriously, but clearly perceive themselves that 
they are doing something very different from what they should be 
doing. Incidentally, this has been the case not only with the 
latest discussion. Whenever a debate on the socioeconomic 
situation is underway, it acquires a truly farcical character. 
The poorly disguised cynicism of some and the perception of 
their own helplessness on the part of others cannot evoke 
anything but laughter through tears. After all, when the 
president himself says, virtually with pride, that he does 
provide bread for the people, no commentary is required. This 
suggests just one conclusion: that these people deserve nothing 
but bread--they deserve neither heat nor light nor other 
foodstuffs, in a word, nothing of what has long been a given for 
the rest of the world at the end of the 20th century. If they 
live, it means that it is possible to live that way--these are 
also the words of the president, who admitted almost a month ago 
that it could not get any worse. But it has, has it not? 
  If we digress from all these sad reflections and try to 
understand what is behind the week-long parliamentary debate, 
approximately the following will emerge. It is clear that the 
issue of responsibility remains the global one: The search for 
yet another scapegoat is on. Until recently, the government 
(before Bagratyan) was quite suitable for this role, whereas 
this time the president has apparently decided to rescue the 
government. Why turn on "our own men" when the "panel of three" 
who made decisions with regard to the monetary reform can be 
saddled with everything? (It is interesting that, according to 
confidential information, only one vote stood in the way of 
"sentencing" the current cabinet at one of the latest meetings 
of the board of the Armenian National Movement). It was for a 
reason that the deputies persistently tried to learn whether 
there had been differences between the state commission and the 
government. The members of the "panel of three" answered this 
question quite evasively, whereas A. Yegiazaryan in essence gave 
a clear-cut answer: The government has nothing to do with the 
monetary reform. A fine how do you do! The state commission is 
to blame for everything, and the government is not involved. Who 
created the "panel of three?" The parliament. So, hold the panel 
accountable. Do you recall that a representative of the 
parliament, Tigran Sarkisyan, was precisely the one to make the 
most vigorous presentations during the days of the monetary 
reform and immediately thereafter? He sort of assumed the role 
of leader. So, this deputy took virtually no part in the debate 
that was held. 
  Here is one more argument in favor of the suggestion that 
the 
government is trying to distance itself from the monetary reform 
in every way possible: Why is the issue of subordinating the 
Central Bank to the Council of Ministers being raised right now 
rather than before the introduction of the national currency? 
If, as Minister of Finance L. Barkhudaryan assures us, the 
government was ready to take this step, why did it not assume 
control over the process, agreeing instead to establish the 
state commission? So that it would be possible to blame it for 
everything later? 
  After all, judging by the presentations of the members of 
the 
government, a sharp loss of the value of the dram and, as a 
consequence, a price stalemate had been predetermined ahead of 
time. As it turns out, all credit for Armenia has been frozen 
since November. Not a single international financial 
organization, not a single country which has been approached for 
help undertook to ensure the stabilization fund of the Armenian 
national currency. It turns out, as Kh. Arutyunyan observed, 
that the government ensured merely the technical aspect of the 
endeavor--the exchange of currency within a record short period 
of time which, incidentally, greatly shattered the nerves of the 
already worn-down population. It is hard to disagree with Kh. 
Arutyunyan on something else, too: the situation is socially 
explosive, and emergency measures are needed which originate 
precisely with the president. Meanwhile, the government coolly 
states that there is hyperinflation, and demands additional 
powers in order to stabilize the situation in six months(!) 
There is a wise Armenian saying about this: Either the donkey or 
his master will die by then. 
  I am far from thinking that the prime minister and his team 
alone are to blame for everything. Of course, their blame, as 
well as that of the "panel of three," for the specific 
present-day situation is indisputable. However, who is to blame 
for the executive authorities being given carte-blanche during 
at least the last two years? Who has ensured the virtually 
complete lack of control over the operation of the government? 
Who has dealt absolutely all the cards to the president, while 
at the same time not daring to openly hold anybody accountable? 
During the more than three years of its existence the Armenian 
parliament has reduced itself to the level of the most helpless 
and powerless structure which allows anything at all to be done 
to it. It was no accident that Deputy S. Zolyan said directly 
that the parliament presently performs the functions of merely 
the fourth branch of power, the press, because it is allowed to 
say all it wants, but nobody pays any attention to it. 
  However, the crisis of absolutely all branches of power is 
apparent. It appears that everybody has a clear notion as far as 
the parliament and the government are concerned (to say nothing 
about judicial power). However, will the president succeed in 
coming out wearing white gloves this time, too? To be sure, the 
stains are quite easy to see, but there is no dearth of 
experience in getting them out.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serzh Sarkisyan, minister of defense of the </F>
Republic of Armenia, by Mikhail Serdyukov in Yerevan; date not 
given: "Minister of Defense of the Republic of Armenia Serzh 
Sarkisyan: `Why Do We, Lieutenant, Need Foreign Land?': When I 
Turn My Ardor to My Family, It Means the War Has Ended..."] 
  [Text] ...And it seemed that this happened yesterday. 
There were more bullets than people on the streets of blockaded 
Stepanakert. Serzh said to me: "We are being shot at like in a 
shooting gallery. But all this will end soon. We will take 
Shusha (the city fort, a former health resort on a high hill 
overlooking Stepanakert--Mikhail Serdyukov)." 
  Shusha seemed to be and was inaccessible. There was 
incessant firing from there: cannons, "barrages," and when the 
snipers aimed, it was always for the forehead. Only an 
out-and-out Suvorov or a totally mad descendant would dare to 
assault this monster. Serzh is a person without extremes. He 
just established an army of self-defense forces of Artsakh. He 
is a philologist. 
  They took Shusha. And a lot more. They moved military 
operations beyond the boundaries of Nagorno-Karabakh. Serzhik 
became a national hero. Researchers will also study the 
phenomenon of this commander. But for the present... 
  For the present, there is a new blockade. Of all 
Armenia already. An economic blockade, and it is the most 
merciless. There is no light or gas, and there is little to eat. 
The army is shattered. The president of the republic invites 
Serzh Sarkisyan to the post of minister of defense of Armenia. 
He is surprised, but he leaves his family in Stepanakert and 
goes to frozen Yerevan. This is where we met. 
  [Serdyukov] I have already been warned: It is the practice 
in 
the higher echelons of Armenian authority to use strictly 
official forms of address: "Mr. President, Mr. Minister." How 
should I address you? 
  [Sarkisyan] As an old friend. 
  [Serdyukov] Thank you, Serzhik. What kind of songs is the 
minister of defense singing today? 
  [Sarkisyan] I am still a long way off from a personal 
performance. But I like to listen to the White Guard's songs. 
Malinin's, for example. 
  [Serdyukov] He sings sincerely: "Why do we, lieutenant, need 
foreign land?" If I readdress this question to you--will you be 
able to answer it? 
  [Sarkisyan] Go ahead and ask: Why did you seize Azerbaijani 
territory. In autumn of 1992 we were able to stop the 
Azerbaijani Army and got an opportunity to keep 
Nagorno-Karabakh. But how was this to be done? After all, 
Stepanakert was being battered by cannon from the well-known 
Agdam--point-blank. You even took a picture of a little girl 
with a broken leg--have you forgotten? 
  [Serdyukov] Can you really forget such a thing? Do you know 
how she is living now? 
  [Sarkisyan] She is alive. But others died. Azerbaijani Army 
groups that were concentrated on our borders continued to hit 
cities and villages. After all, every sector of the republic was 
fired on from there. And that could have gone on endlessly. It 
is impossible to compare Azerbaijan's military potential in any 
way even with that of Armenia, not to mention the NKR 
[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]. There are not many Karabakh 
residents. And there was only one solution: Only through bravery 
and attack could we demoralize the huge Azerbaijani force. We 
circulated the disinformation that allegedly we were appeased. 
We said that we expected the next attack of the Azerbaijani Army 
in the spring of 1993. And we gave assurances: They will not 
attack us in the winter and, of course, everyone could ease up... 
  [Serdyukov] And did they take the bait? 
  [Sarkisyan] Yes. In January of 1993 the Azerbaijanis began a 
powerful offensive in the firm conviction that we were not ready 
to repel them. Within two weeks they were completely exhausted. 
We launched a counteroffensive. The aim was to straighten out 
the front. This required going outside the NKR's boundaries. 
  [Serdyukov] You really got outside them very well! You 
captured up to one-fifth of the entire Republic of Azerbaijan. 
You were suddenly transformed from defenders of your own land to 
aggressors. 
  [Sarkisyan] Of course, for Azerbaijan, this is aggression. 
Although there is a nuance: After all, they do not recognize the 
NKR as an independent state, and continue to consider the 
Karabakh people as their subjects. So, what kind of aggression 
is this? Our people against our people. I will say frankly: We 
do not need their land. We were simply ensuring the safety of 
our families. And supplying the army with captured weapons. 
Furthermore, Karabakh has been completely destroyed and burned 
down. Three years of war is no joke. But with what does one 
rebuild? At whose expense? There is nothing in Armenia, and the 
mice are dying from hunger in empty cornbins. There was only one 
solution: Get the building materials in Azerbaijan. 
  [Serdyukov] In Azerbaijan they think they are fighting 
against Armenia. 
  [Sarkisyan] They can be understood. It is embarrassing to 
admit that, having such a powerful military potential, they 
cannot achieve victory over tiny Karabakh. Although I know: They 
clearly realize this among themselves. They do not want to admit 
publicly in Baku that they are at war with Karabakh. After all, 
they have been unable up to now to take even one Armenian 
soldier captive. I met with the minister of defense of 
Azerbaijan in Tbilisi recently at the initiative of Russian 
General Reut. He tried to prove to me that regular subunits of 
the Armenian Army were participating in the war. He showed me 
the identity papers of a captured soldier with the inscription 
"Volunteer." A passport with the registration is Yerevan. I 
explained to him simply, in the Russian language--in the 
presence of Reut: We have many prisoners, both Russian and 
Ukrainian, but I am not saying that Karabakh is at war with 
Russia or with Ukraine. 
  [Serdyukov] Does this mean that you did not succeed in 
coming 
closer to an agreement with your Azerbaijani colleague? 
  [Sarkisyan] We did not achieve anything. This meeting was an 
initiative of the Russian general. His personal initiative. 
Without any authority from Moscow. As he said: "He has great 
personal desire for this war to end more quickly." 
  [Serdyukov] But what about you, do you have another desire? 
  [Sarkisyan] God forbid! And the Azerbaijan minister of 
defense wants the same. 
  [Serdyukov] A paradox: Everyone wants peace, and the carnage 
continues. 
  [Sarkisyan] The trouble is that an end to the war means 
different things for us and for them. For Karabakh, the end of 
the war is recognition of independence. But for Azerbaijan, as 
their minister of defense put it, "the return of all of the 
administrative units, including Karabakh as well..." 
  [Serdyukov] But this is a closed circle! With the arrival of 
Geydar Aliyev, a cautious person, the hope has emerged in you 
personally that you will finally come to an agreement? 
  [Sarkisyan] When he came to power I did have this kind of 
hope. Alas, it has now been dispelled. Under Aliyev, Azerbaijan 
ended up completely militarized. Everything there is now 
absolutely subordinated to war. The people, the economy. 
  [Serdyukov] Are there really no prospects? 
  [Sarkisyan] I do not see any, and there is already no choice 
now even for Aliyev. Because many people perished during his 
time. He has to have at least some kind of justification for 
this. I am confident that if in a month Azerbaijan loses a 
million or two million soldiers, but at the same time returns 
some part of their territory, no one will begin to reproach 
Aliyev. The sacrifices will be justified. But if he does not 
succeed in achieving anything, he will be held responsible, as 
others were. 
  [Serdyukov] What millions are you talking about? What is 
this, world war? 
  [Sarkisyan] But already today almost twice as many have been 
killed in Azerbaijan as in the whole war in Afghanistan. 
According to the most conservative figures, 25,000-26,000! And 
in Aliyev's opinion, 3,500 persons are in captivity in Karabakh, 
800--in Armenia. 
  [Serdyukov] But how many in fact? 
  [Sarkisyan] We do not have that many prisoners. He is 
confusing them with those who are missing in action. But we even 
earlier asked to gather up the bodies. However, the Azerbaijanis 
did not do this. Why? Well, so that the people would have no 
idea of the extent of their own losses. And they are not 
gathering up the bodies now. Although Karabakh is ready to grant 
this opportunity at any time. 
  [Serdyukov] How big are Armenia's losses? 
  [Sarkisyan] One of ours against 12 Azerbaijanis. 
  [Serdyukov] Serzhik, what about a campaign against Baku? 
While sitting at one time at a Karabakh table I also had 
occasion to hear this outlook from the mouths of soldiers of the 
self-defense army. 
  [Sarkisyan] This was a joke, very likely, a drunken one. You 
understand, Azerbaijan has an objective, and after achieving it, 
it will conclude the war. Enter Stepanakert--that is all. 
Period! Karabakh does not have an objective at present. It has 
one task: to stand at the present line and repel attacks. There 
is no point now for a Karabakh soldier to reach so that the war 
will end. We do not need Baku, nor on the whole even one 
centimeter of land. And the Karabakhs will return all the 
territory of Azerbaijan without vacillation as soon as they 
receive guarantees that they will not shoot in the direction of 
their motherland. 
  [Serdyukov] What kind of guarantees are you talking about? 
  [Sarkisyan] Recognizing the Karabakh Republic. The 
introduction of peacekeeping forces in the area of conflict. We 
cannot believe in words anymore. After all, even in the 
Azerbaijan system Karabakh was autonomous and had some 
guarantees according to the USSR Constitution. 
  [Serdyukov] I have already been shivering with cold with 
everybody in Armenia for a week. I met quite a few Yerevan 
people who curse the war to the hilt. They are convinced that it 
is precisely Karabakh that brought them to complete 
impoverishment, chronic freezing, and a life of semistarvation. 
Do you not consider the possibility of exacerbating 
Armenian-Karabakh relations? 
  [Sarkisyan] Now is not the time for division. Only unity 
will 
save us today. And the leadership of Armenia declared more than 
once that it agrees to any decisions at which the two 
belligerents arrive. There would be peace. 
  [Serdyukov] Will it not become boring for you to live in 
peace and quiet? What will you occupy yourself with, as minister 
of defense? Or as philologist Serzhik Sarkisyan? 
  [Sarkisyan] I have not thought about this. But I know one 
thing: The first day of peace will be the happiest day of my 
life. But as a philologist, perhaps I have lost many 
professional qualities. 
  [Serdyukov] What is your specialization? 
  [Sarkisyan] The Armenian language and literature. I 
graduated 
from the University of Yerevan and returned home--you know how 
closely I was watched in Karabakh by the Azerbaijani leaders. To 
them, a person who received his education in Armenia and had 
some ideas and national habits was considered a social outcast. 
But I was invited to the city party committee of the Komsomol 
[All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League], and I became the 
supervisor of the sports and mass-defense branch. Then I became 
the secretary. There I really felt the pressure. All "lucrative" 
positions went only to one's own. They spat on the Armenian 
language. It was forbidden to write and speak it. But after all, 
Armenians living in the NKAO [Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous 
Oblast] comprised 70 percent of the total population. 
  [Serdyukov] Peace is as good a time as any for language. But 
what will you do with the uniform of a military minister? 
  [Sarkisyan] Well, I do not have any kind of uniform. 
Remember 
the old camouflage uniform I wore in Karabakh? It is in my 
wardrobe. This is my entire military dress. 
  [Serdyukov] But what about the gold shoulderboards? After 
all, the minister has some kind of rank? 
  [Sarkisyan] Captain of the Reserve. But this goes back to 
peaceful times long ago. What am I supposed to do, confer a rank 
upon myself? How could I then look into the eyes of the 
professional military? After the capture of Shusha, while still 
in Karabakh, they wanted to promote me to general--I refused. I 
consider myself a civilian to this day. But I became military, 
even if the minister, out of necessity. On the other hand, when 
I meet with ministers of defense of other states (they are all 
marshals), I am not intimidated. I am dressed in civilian 
clothes, and I converse with them as an equal. Military rank 
obligates one to something. And then I am not a particular 
expert in military commands. I show up among the troops in a 
regular suit. 
  [Serdyukov] But how do you command... without commands? 
  [Sarkisyan] My favorite command is "forward!" Everyone knows 
this. 
  [Serdyukov] Is this when, pistol in hand, you lead soldiers 
in an attack? 
  [Sarkisyan] That also has happened. But I was not minister 
of 
defense of Armenia at the time. 
  [Serdyukov] Were there many military in your family? 
  [Sarkisyan] Not one. A grandfather was shot in 1937. He was 
a 
shepherd. My father was a blacksmith since the age of 13. He has 
been on pension a long time, but until now he has been in the 
Stepanakert defense rayon repairing weapons. Mama has worked all 
her life at the silk combine. In Nagorno-Karabakh. My wife, a 
music teacher, and two of my daughters are there now. 
  [Serdyukov] Why do you not take them to Yerevan? 
  [Sarkisyan] It is warmer there. And although the bombing has 
started again, both daughters are going to school. No one will 
be going to school in Armenia before spring. 
  [Serdyukov] But the territory of Armenia is also being fired 
on now. We already have the first victims. Is yet another war 
starting? 
  [Sarkisyan] We could respond to these provocations with 
power 
strikes. But, after all, this will really lead to a wide-scale 
war. I see two reasons here. With these incidents, the 
Azerbaijanis, thinking that our army is fighting in Karabakh, 
are allegedly trying to draw off some of our forces. And to show 
to the whole world that they are fighting Armenia, but not 
Karabakh. We are avoiding such a war in every possible way. 
Although I should put our aircraft into the air, and a strike 
from which they will not recover quickly will be delivered. 
  [Serdyukov] Are the pilots, excuse the stupid question, 
Russian? 
  [Sarkisyan] You are being insulting. They are all Armenian. 
  [Serdyukov] Incidentally, nothing has been heard for a long 
time about the pilots who were knocked down in the Stepanakert 
skies--a Russian and a Ukrainian. I met with one of them, pilot 
Bilichenko, two years ago in prison. He was convinced he would 
be shot. 
  [Sarkisyan] Of course, they are criminals. But I think that 
their life should be spared. But this is not their war, why did 
they get into it? 
  [Serdyukov] And are the mujahidin fighting in Karabakh now? 
  [Sarkisyan] Afghanistan has not admitted this fact 
officially. I think they are right. After all, a mujahidin is 
not a soldier of the Afghan Army. They are ordinary mercenaries. 
  [Serdyukov] Have you succeeded in taking any of them 
captive? 
  [Sarkisyan] Not for the time being. They fight in the rear. 
They stand as defensive detachments, and they shoot retreating 
Azerbaijani soldiers. But there is a captive Turkish officer. I 
know for a certainty: There are many Russian, Ukrainian, and 
Belarusian officers fighting. 
  [Serdyukov] Do you have enough such volunteers on your part? 
  [Sarkisyan] We do not have mujahidin, believe me. 
  [Serdyukov] Tell me, please, is your army helping Karabakh 
with weapons? 
  [Sarkisyan] We acquired some things for them in third 
countries, in the West. But this is meager in comparison with 
what the Azerbaijanis are losing themselves and what the 
Karabakhs acquire after successful strikes of the NKR defense 
army. This is on the order of 120 tanks, powerful artillery, and 
whole depots of infantry weapons and ammunition. Even the 
Armenian Army does not have such stores of weapons as there are 
now in Karabakh. 
  [Serdyukov] But where did Azerbaijan get so many weapons? 
  [Sarkisyan] They do not have to go far. A hundred tanks were 
acquired recently in Ukraine. Also aircraft and ammunition. 
Incidentally, they do not deny this there. They justify it by 
the difficult economic situation. In addition, according to the 
information of prisoners and captured materiel, it can be said 
that Azerbaijan acquired many new T-72 tanks. Where? It is 
obvious to us: Russia. For example, in Nikolayev they received 
BMP-2's [infantry combat vehicle] not so long ago. Ammunition 
was delivered from Tula. 
  [Serdyukov] Does our Grachev deny all this? 
  [Sarkisyan] Of course. The entire Russian leadership, 
civilian and military, flatly refuse to admit their military 
assistance to Azerbaijan. It is just a pity that your country 
does not take one thing into account: Our enemy is acquiring 
weapons not only from the countries of the near abroad. In 
China--assault rifles. In the Czech Republic--machine guns and 
grenade launchers produced in 1993. All this firepower falls on 
tiny Karabakh. But how is one to understand this from the human 
standpoint? 
  [Serdyukov] Well, fine, but did you not have a conversation 
in this regard with Grachev himself. By telephone, but 
man-to-man? 
  [Sarkisyan] Our president engages in this. But I think that 
if there was a conversation with Grachev, it would not have 
changed very much. The chaos that exists in the arms trade, in 
my opinion, cannot even be controlled by the minister of defense 
of Russia. 
  [Serdyukov] If you had the opportunity to talk with our 
president, what would you say to him? 
  [Sarkisyan] I want to request one thing of Yeltsin and of 
all 
Russians: Act in such a way that our Karabakh does not perish. 
You are powerful. Help us. 
  [Serdyukov] I know that general mobilization was declared in 
Azerbaijan a long time ago. What is the case in this respect in 
Armenia? 
  [Sarkisyan] The minister of defense does not need this. For 
the time being. But it is difficult for me to guess what will 
occur tomorrow. 
  [Serdyukov] Have you gotten very tired in recent years? Do 
you have a desire to lie in bed for a few days and at least once 
to sleep as much as you want? 
  [Sarkisyan] I would not refuse, of course. I do not get more 
than five hours of sleep a day. But then I think of the boys who 
are fighting today in the mountains in 40 degrees of frost. For 
two-three months in the forward area... 
  [Serdyukov] What is your biggest misfortune in life--what is 
it associated with? 
  [Sarkisyan] I have lost so many friends in recent years. 
These were fellows who deserved to live. The sadness is not to 
meet with them anymore on this earth. 
  [Serdyukov] Serzhik, for these years of the war, your chest 
should be glistening with medals. 
  [Sarkisyan] But there are no combat decorations in Armenia. 
There are in Karabakh: combat crosses of the first and second 
degree. Azerbaijan has the title of national hero. They are fine 
fellows. 
  [Serdyukov] And what cross do you have? 
  [Sarkisyan] Imagine, I have none. 
  [Serdyukov] And if you had some free time, what would you 
engage in? 
  [Sarkisyan] I would go hunting in our Karabakh forests. 
There 
is no more beautiful place on earth. With Robert Kocharyan, my 
boyhood friend. He shoots very accurately. With a rifle. 
  [Serdyukov] Better than you? 
  [Sarkisyan] We have not competed for a long time. 
  [Serdyukov] Did you have occasion to shoot in the war? 
  [Sarkisyan] Rarely--but it happened. 
  [Serdyukov] Do you get a chance to read books? 
  [Sarkisyan] To my great regret, no. 
  [Serdyukov] And you have probably not seen your family for a 
long time? 
  [Sarkisyan] I have a real Armenian family. The husband 
commands in it. I like this most of all. 
  [Serdyukov] Do you really have little to command at work? 
  [Sarkisyan] Too much. 
  [Serdyukov] But what is the matter? 
  [Sarkisyan] The fact that when I turn my ardor to my family, 
it means the war has ended.

<F P=106> [Article by Vagram Stepanyan: "Armenia Will Have a </F>
Full-Strength Army by Spring"] 
  [Text] [words illegible] successfully. This statement was 
heard at a briefing of state minister of the Republic of Armenia 
and Chairman of the Republic Call-Up Commission Vazgen 
Sarkisyan, at which Major General Artur 
Arutyunyan, chief of the republic's Main Mobilization 
Administration, was also present. 
  According to the state minister's report, the republic 
call-up has been fulfilled by 100.16 percent. These are not 
simply figures--a real person stands behind each of them. For 
the first time in the past four years the call-up was organized 
and conducted on the exterritorial principle, i.e., none of the 
conscripts, not counting individual exceptions, will serve in 
the places of his immediate [words illegible]. However, as he 
noted, there are still regions where the call-up periods have 
been extended for good reason. In particular, in Gyumr and 
Vanadzora it will go on for another 10 days in order to bring 
the lacking 511 and 244 persons respectively up to strength. 
  Thus, speaking in military fashion, the task has been 
accomplished. However, the task is not limited only to a 
quantitative aspect. It also has a qualitative side which must 
be made sure of by thorough, daily, and goal-directed work in 
the units. Otherwise,the successfully completed first stage of 
the campaign will prove to be a useless waste of effort, time, 
and funds. Actually, it is already possible today to talk about 
the existence of the institution of the organizing of national 
armed forces. Now the matter depends on the improvement of their 
military training and combat readiness, as well as on the 
establishment of general army discipline. Incidentally, 
according to Mr. Sarkisyan, a number of commanders of different 
ranks have been relieved of duty for non-fulfillment of these 
requirements as well as for inability to create conditions for 
the psychological "assimilation" of new recruits and lack of 
skill in investigating their non-regulation (neustavnyy) 
interrelations, which has led to certain accidents. Some 147 
deserters are already on the run from this recruitment through 
the fault of such apologies for commanders. Criminal punishments 
will be applied to them. 
  Basically the call-up went without hindrance and in an 
organized manner. 
  At the same time, as the briefing participants noted, there 
are still parents who suffer from the "defect" of protecting 
beloved children from service in the army in every way possible. 
Such psychology is characteristic also of refugees from 
Azerbaijan and the Yezids who consitute a national minority in 
the republic. Nevertheless, the assurance was expressed that as 
a result of the appropriate actions this situation will be set 
right by spring, i.e., by the next call-up. 
  Answering the journalists' questions, the speakers reported 
about the intention to conduct regular inspections in military 
units which will make it possible to eliminate shortcomings and 
to resolve various problems. Today, in the words of the state 
minister, they have no problems with food and clothing. There 
exists only a problem with barracks. The fact is that in the 
southern part of the republic there are none at all and one must 
build new ones or [word illegible] old ones. [word illegible] 
important task one can [word illegible], the latest news [word 
illegible] also in the creation of higher educational 
institutions which will permit replenishment of the ranks of the 
national army with highly educated and skilled officers. 
  In conclusion Mr. Sarkisyan expressed gratitude to all the 
services that participated in the call-up campaign: the rayon 
military commisariats, internal affairs organs, military police 
personnel, and local authorities as well as the journalists 
present for assistance in the successful completion of the 
autumn call-up.

<F P=106> [Article by Gayane Melikyan, NOYAN TAPAN correspondent: "So </F>
Will We Go to Batumi?; Petroleum Processing in Armenia is 
Threatened"] 
  [Text] Information: By a directive of the Government 
of the Republic of Armenia of 24 May 1993 it was decided to 
create a petroleum processing complex on the base of the Yerevan 
Polivinilatsetat Plant. A contract was concluded between the 
"MOST" association for business cooperation with foreign 
countries and the Polivinilatsetat Plant on 28 May 1993. It was 
based on the "General Agreement on Joint Production-Commercial 
and Investment Activity," concluded between the Russian 
Federation Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Russian 
Federation Committee on the Chemical and Petrochemical Industry, 
and the Government of the Republic of Armenia. 
  The need to create a petroleum processing production unit in 
Armenia is conditioned by its acute demand for heating and motor 
fuel, as well as by the possibility of partially supplying the 
republic's chemical complex with needed chemicals. Liquefied 
gas, gasoline fraction, aviation kerosene, diesel fuel, and fuel 
oil (mazut) will be obtained, as well as pentane-hexane (the 
basic raw material for the production of acetic acid), which 
will make it possible for Nairit to produce acetic acid, which 
is used at the Polivinilatsetat Plant in the production of vinyl 
acetate. The utilization of crude oil with a low sulphur content 
from Western Siberia is envisaged in the initial stage, the 
movement of which over the Novosibirsk-Batumi-Yerevan route is 
simpler and more economical than the products of its processing, 
since crude oil, unlike mazut, does not freeze under low 
temperature conditions and is far smaller in volume than the 
volume of the components obtained after processing. 
  A group of specialists invited by the "MOST" association for 
familiarization with the state of affairs on the spot was 
dispatched to the Polivinilatsetat Plant for the purpose of 
creating the petroleum processing complex. The conducting of 
research work and the execution of orders for the manufacture of 
the equipment required is also called for. At the request of the 
association the basic equipment manufacturing plants have 
already started to work on the requisite equipment. The 
association has given advanced payments for the preliminary 
stages of operations to certain plants for the manufacture of 
the necessary equipment and has also come to an agreement with a 
number of CIS petroleum processing plants about giving the 
Polivinilatsetat Plant new equipment. Part of it was ready for 
shipment to Armenia already in the beginning of November. A good 
deal has been done in the last six months, it seems, in the 
direction of resolving this question which is vitally important 
for Armenia. 
  However, we are forced to note that up to this day, despite 
the numerous appeals and telegrams on the part of the "MOST" 
association, the Armenian side has not paid for the work 
performed. We have tried to get an explanation concerning this 
from the director of the Polivinilatsetat Plant and to 
familiarize ourselves with the situation on the spot. Director 
M. Davtyan has kindly given us detailed information on the 
course of the conduct of operations. Thus, the organization of 
petroleum processing at the Polivinilatsetat Plant is very 
beneficial as regards the saving of funds, since there are 
unutilized fixed capital and engineering service lines on the 
plant's territory, the plant has skilled engineering-technical 
personnel and workers and, what is the main thing, the heating 
fuel will be used by the nearby Yerevan Heat and Electric Power 
Station and the acetic acid raw material by Nairit which is 
located in the vicinity. 
  Taking all this into consideration, the specialists have 
concluded that all costs related to the organization of this 
production unit would be recovered in four months and 
construction work would be confined to 12 months all told. As 
far as the course of the operations is concerned, the director 
noted with regret that already over several months directives 
concerning the apportionment of 800 million to the "MOST" 
organization's account from the 1.2 billion rubles in credits 
granted to the Polivinilatsetat Plant have passed from the prime 
minister to various state ministers, the ministries of 
economics, industry, and finance and to the State Bank, to no 
effect however. 
  Familiarity with the documents and directives leaves no room 
for doubt that all these officials well realize the urgency of 
the question and, it seems, are interested in its prompt 
solution. However, the fact is that the question has not been 
resolved in months. This loss of time will cost dearly and, 
undoubtedly, will affect the future of our republic, which is in 
a desperate energy situation. The Russian Federation has warned 
that installation of equipment in the already prepared sections 
of the plant before the coming of cold weather will be imperiled 
because of non-payment for the operations of the preceding stage 
by the Armenian side. The dragging-out of technological 
operations in 1993 not only will lead to an appreciable increase 
in the cost of the project but the time periods for the testing 
and operation of the plant also will have to be postponed to the 
beginning of the winter of 1994-95.

<F P=106> [Armenpress report: "People Need Normal Conditions"] </F>
  [Text] A "roundtable" in the House of Journalists organized 
by the "Armenia-Russia" and "Ayk" societies and the Journalists 
Union of the Republic of Armenia was devoted to problems of the 
migration of the population from the country. 
  The chairman of the "Armenia-Russia" society, Professor of 
Philology Vladimir Grigoryan, who opened the meeting, emphasized 
the importance of the problem under discussion. The ultimate 
goal of the "roundtable," he said, is the development and 
submission of recommendations to the republic's government. 
  The scientists who spoke subsequently--sociologists, 
economists, demographers--were almost unanimous in the main 
point: the problem of migration should be examined and monitored 
at the state level. 
  As one should have anticipated, opinions differed in the 
particulars. Thus, the director of the Sociological Research 
Center, Gevorg Pogosyan, who cited a figure for those annually 
leaving the Republic of Armenia (23,000-25,000--this is only 
those stricken from residence permit registration and how many 
leave while retaining it is not known precisely), focused the 
attention of his colleagues on the "brain" drain from the 
country. That is why it is necessary to create conditions for 
full-blooded work in the motherland for national intellectuals. 
The fact is that there are scientists and even entire institutes 
of the European level in Armenia. The diaspora and friendly 
developed states can help in this matter; however, not on the 
crudely "humanitarian" level being done, for example, in 
Bangladesh and Somalia. 
  The prominent Armenian sociologist Agaron Adibekyan offered 
his vision of the problem: study the mental state of the 
migrants, who, in his view, are siezed with a fear of the 
unknown based upon an information vacuum. Explanatory "therapy" 
is needed in order for people to know what is waiting for them 
in the future and how to adjust to difficulties and to find a 
way out of the negative realities on the spot. 
  Doctor of Economic Sciences Suren Karapetyan, who considers 
that the outflow of population from the Republic of Armenia is a 
good thing under present conditions, expressed a contrary point 
of view. As an argument he referred to the objective capability 
of Armenia's agriculture to feed its population of almost four 
million only for... two months a year. And even industry is not 
capable of ensuring its needs under market economy conditions, 
as well as the employment of labor. That is why it is pointless 
to raise the question of hindering the outflow of the 
population. One needs only to selectively regulate it to retain 
the cadres which constitute the nation's intellectual potential. 
  Rafik Seyranyan, a scientific associate of the Institute of 
Philosophy, dwelt on the problem, dear to him, of refugees, a 
certain portion of whom, after a short sojourn in the 
motherland, have left it. In particular he noted the 
significance of their intellectual and labor potential for 
Armenia, having proposed the creation of a data bank (not a 
primitive questionnaire one but one more in depth) in order to 
utilize this considerable force for the good of the republic. 
  The emotional speech of Candidate of Economic Sciences Sevak 
Ayvazyan provoked the approval of the majority. He named the 
breakdown of the former union and the rejection (even if 
temporary) of a pro-Russian orientation as the global cause of 
the breakdown of life (and as a consequence--of mass migration). 
Having supported the idea of the creation of a governmental 
organ on migration-related problems, S. Ayvazyan also stated the 
urgency of the day-to-day ensuring of the survival of our 
compatriots. 
  An interesting thought was heard in the speech of 
cooperative 
chairman Suron Tarkhanyan, who suggested the idea of the 
balancing of exports and imports. Nothing prevents Armenia from 
exporting work groups and services besides goods, for example, 
the construction brigades traditionally in demand in the CIS 
countries. Organization of the latter should emanate from state 
structures. This will relieve the republic and also will bring 
in a profit to the republic from abroad.

Presidential Candidate, Today Under Investigation"] 
  [Text] The Supreme Soviet of Armenia almost unanimously 
gave its consent to the institution of criminal proceedings 
against Myasnik Akopyan, president of the republic's Union of 
Entrepreneurs, Lessees, and Cooperative Workers. He is accused 
of appropriating state funds in especially large amounts. 
  According to the statement by Artavazd Gevorkyan, 
procurator-general of the Republic of Armenia, the director of 
the Union of Entrepreneurs, who at one time put forward his 
candidacy for the post of Armenia's president, through 
machinations and forgeries appropriated more than 34 million 
rubles. 
  The parliament's consent to the institution of criminal 
proceedings against Akopyan was needed in connection with the 
fact that he was put forward as a candidate for deputy of the 
Supreme Soviet. 
  Myasnik Akopyan is known in the republic for his extravagant 
escapades. Two years ago he was about to violate state monopoly 
on the issue of money. Akopyan intended to make his own coupons 
and even began to print them. According to him, the coupons were 
supposed to create competition for the state monetary unit (at 
that time the ruble) and in time even to displace it. At that 
time Meruzhan Mikayelyan, former chief of the Currency 
Administration of the republic's Ministry of Finance, called 
that venture a joke and a highly shady operation. 
  As we see, the fantasies of trickster Akopyan took him far 
away.

<F P=106> [Article by Armen Khanbabyan: "Possibly, Iranian Gas Will </F>
Enter Europe Through the Transcaucasus"] 
  [Text] A few days ago directors of the Armenian Armgazprom 
State Enterprise were in Teheran as experts in the supply of 
Iranian gas to Europe project. Prior to this trip 
representatives of the German firm Ruhrgas, as well as gas 
workers from France and from Iran's national gas company, 
visited Yerevan. In the course of all these meetings the 
question of the laying of a gas pipeline from Iran to Europe was 
examined. It is quite obvious that this question, in addition to 
economic, is also of political significance. Today there are 
only two options for the laying of a new gas pipeline: through 
Armenia and Azerbaijan or through Turkey's territory to Europe. 
Both of these projects are approximately equal in cost. However, 
it is clear that today the chances of both Armenia and 
Azerbaijan for the laying of the gas pipeline on the territory 
of these states are much smaller than Turkey's chances, owing to 
the fact that an unstable political situation exists in the 
region and the confrontation in Nagorno-Karabakh continues. 
European countries, which are very interested in getting Iranian 
gas, will hardly agree to the laying of this fuel artery, which 
is vitally important to them, through a politically unstable 
region. Meanwhile, for Armenia and Azerbaijan the laying of the 
gas pipeline from Iran to Europe would be of extremely great 
importance both economically and politically and would enable 
these countries to seriously engage in the restoration of their 
economy, which suffers extremely from fuel shortage. 
  Today the situation is as follows: During approximately one 
and a half years countries interested in the passage of the gas 
pipeline through their territory, that is, Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
and Turkey, will prepare a special feasibility report on behalf 
of their countries. The Armenian side has already begun to work 
in this direction. In Yerevan there is also the hope that by the 
time the projects are submitted for an examination by experts 
the problem of Nagornyy Karabakh will be solved to one degree or 
another and the political aspect will cease to hamper the 
implementation of plans for the republic's economic restoration.

<F P=106> [Article by Armen Khanbabyan: "Minister of Internal Affairs </F>
Accuses Former National Security Adviser"] 
  [Text] The recent press conference of Ashot Manucharyan, 
former chief national security adviser to Armenia's president, 
which seemed like an everyday event, received an unexpected and 
loud continuation. We would like to recall that Manucharyan 
announced his intention to create a new analytic and 
sociopolitical structure intended to promote the settlement of 
the Karabakh problem. Moreover, he came out with sharp criticism 
against the activity of the republic's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and proclaimed a categorical disagreement with the 
presidential edict on KGB reorganization. 
  Since the criticism against the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
was of a general nature and new analytic centers of such a trend 
multiply very actively in Armenia, nothing promised a political 
storm. However, Vano Siradegyan, the republic's minister of 
internal affairs, unexpectedly took up arms against Manucharyan. 
He held a briefing, in the course of which scandalous 
information was promulgated. Thus, according to the minister, it 
turned out that the entire activity of the former national 
security adviser was directed against the republic's national 
interests and Manucharyan himself, being by nature a "remarkable 
schemer," almost seized real absolute power. According to 
Siradegyan, Manucharyan kept an eye on the KGB, the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, the army, and the tax inspectorate, placed his 
people in key posts in the Council of Ministers, in the 
Administration of Special Programs, who maintain communication 
with Karabakh, and in the Armenian Industrial Construction Bank, 
as well as "tried to seize national television." At the same 
time, Siradegyan recalled that Manucharyan played a destructive 
role in the previous Karabakh Committee, out of which the 
Armenian Pannational Movement grew subsequently. According to 
Siradegyan, it was Manucharyan who at one time broke up the 
planned combination and cooperation in the Karabakh question 
between the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia 
and the Armenian Pannational Movement. He enlisted many morally 
unscrupulous individuals from Komsomol organs in the movement 
and set prominent leaders of the Armenian Pannational Movement 
at loggerheads. Siradegyan asserted that Manucharyan did his 
utmost to cause a split between the present president and former 
prime minister Vazgen Manukyan. Furthermore, the opinion that 
power in Karabakh, allegedly, belongs to the Dashnaktsutyun 
Party has become popular since Manucharyan's service. However, 
in Siradegyan's opinion, power, not party-political, structures 
had real authority in Stepanakert. From Siradegyan's speech it 
became known that the former chief adviser contributed to the 
transformation of the KGB into a criminal commercial structure, 
under the aegis of which currency machinations flourished and 
illegal deals with arms and strategic materials, in particular 
with copper and aluminum, were conducted. With all this 
Manucharyan never sought to occupy a high, responsible post, 
preferring to remain in the background and to act through his 
puppets. Among the latter the following were named: Gevorg 
Vardanyan, former minister of state; Ambartsum Galstyan, former 
mayor of Yerevan; Vagan Shirkhakyan, former deputy minister of 
defense and adviser to the president, and many lower-ranking 
officials. According to Siradegyan's assertion, enjoying the 
high patronage of the chief adviser, all of them committed 
criminally punishable acts: They took diamonds and antiques out 
of Armenia, dictated the currency rate to the black market, 
transported stolen cars from Armenia to Georgia and back, and 
transferred currency funds abroad. In particular, with the 
participation of the former management of the Almaz Plant and 
with Vagan Shirkhakyan's help 2 million dollars were transferred 
to the United States and only recently part of the funds have 
been brought back with great difficulties. It was also declared 
that a certain "Moscow Armenian" manages the circulation of 
criminal money. 
  As Vano Siradegyan said, the state succeeded with great 
difficulty to squeeze Manucharyan out of his positions and to 
rid ministries and departments of his influence, bringing them 
back under government control. The minister declared that all 
the individuals mentioned by him have long been in the focus of 
attention of operational services of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. Their fault is so obvious that the only thing the 
procuracy can do is to institute criminal proceedings against 
them. The only person against whom this will not be simple to do 
is Manucharyan himself, who, as it appears, does not have the 
"harmful" habit of signing any documents. However, the minister 
expects that testimony will help to prove Manucharyan's guilt. 
  Vano Siradegyan also noted that Ashot Manucharyan's present 
high activity and his attempt to again begin exerting influence 
on the solution of the Karabakh problem, undoubtedly, are 
instigated from without by forces, for which the existing social 
and political calm in Armenia is not advantageous and which do 
not want a stabilization of the situation in the conflict 
region. It is these forces that have brought to life the figure 
of the former adviser from political nonexistence. "It is 
ridiculous to say that foreign political problems can be solved 
at the party level and at the public level, as Manucharyan 
asserts," the minister stressed. "The poorly camouflaged attempt 
to again try to get back the lost influence and the 
opportunities connected with it lies behind all this." 
  In general, in Siradegyan's opinion, in Armenia there is a 
widespread faulty practice, under which public figures, who have 
tarnished themselves, try to change their image, appearing as 
members of the opposition so that any actions against them may 
be perceived by the public as an attempt by the authorities to 
restrict civil liberties. The minister's admission of his 
intention to hold a briefing, of which he advised the president 
only at the very last moment, was also curious. Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan received this fact without enthusiasm, because he 
himself was not at all inclined to attach serious significance 
to Ashot Manucharyan's words and actions, considering him an 
unbalanced person. However, the head of the police department 
does not share such an approach, because, as he said, he sees 
well all the danger emanating from his former companion-in-arms. 
Therefore, by his own admission, he decided to "wash the dirty 
linen in public." 
  The minister's revelations evoked the strongest public 
reaction in Armenia and placed the country on the brink of a 
criminal political scandal. A certain confusion is observed at 
the headquarters of the Armenian Pannational Movement. In 
principle, here people are in agreement with Siradegyan. 
However, they consider his action impulsive, unprepared, and 
capable of causing harm rather than good. In the camp of leftist 
Dashnaks and communists there is an unconcealed jubilation in 
connection with the self-exposure in the camp of their 
ideological opponents. 
  Ruben Mirzakhanyan, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, 
declared that, apparently, all this was the beginning of a big 
quarrel between two mafioso clans inside the Armenian 
Pannational Movement, with which, of course, opposition forces 
had nothing to do, and all the attempts to lend a political 
nature to what was going on were provocative. Ashot Navasardyan, 
chairman of the Republican Party, also agreed with this opinion. 
At the same time, he noted that, undoubtedly, forces seeking a 
destablization of the situation in Armenia stood behind 
Manucharyan. The transparent hint by the chief of the police 
department about some "Moscow Armenian" mixed up in mafia 
affairs seems not at all accidental. Not so long ago the 
Armenian minister and Serzh Dzhilovyan, a prominent Moscow 
businessman, exchanged very painful attacks. Dzhilovyan accused 
Siradegyan of organizing an attempt on his life, while 
Siradegyan, in turn, declared that the mafia itself (the 
minister also includes the businessman in it) sooner or later 
would eliminate Dzhilovyan and "Armenia will have nothing to do 
with this." The Moscow businessman's negative attitude toward 
Yerevan's present authorities and his desire to return to 
Armenia as a new leader are not concealed in the least. 
Furthermore, the phrase about Manucharyan's "Komsomol 
entourage," probably, was by no means accidental. A hint about 
Suren Arutyunyan, former Komsomol boss, later former first 
secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia, and a prominent 
representative of Russian-American business, is noted here. 
Moreover, it is no secret that in the question of the solution 
of the Karabakh problem Manucharyan has always been inclined to 
use Moscow's recommendations. Incidentally, the republic's 
present leadership is also inclined to follow the Kremlin's 
advice and not only in the sphere of foreign policy. Therefore, 
it is possible that certain forces in Russia, indeed, have 
decided to use Manucharyan's figure in their interests. 
  There is nothing strange in all this. It is only surprising 
that this circumstance has become the cause of such a sharp and 
prompt reaction. Many people in Yerevan assume that this is 
connected with the fact that Manucharyan possessed information 
compromising a number of figures in the present presidential 
entourage and was preparing to promulgate it at a convenient 
moment. Therefore, the minister of internal affairs simply tries 
to forestall Manucharyan's blow. At the same time, the 
compromise, evidently, concerns mainly the Department of 
Internal Affairs. Possibly, that is why the minister's actions 
were of a spontaneous, not completely thought out, nature. After 
all, as it was accurately clarified, the president, in fact, did 
not know about Siradegyan's intentions until the last moment and 
found out about the specific content of the briefing only after 
it ended. At some moment it seemed that Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
would make a statement, in which he would dissociate himself 
from individual pronouncements by his minister, especially on 
matters of a foreign political nature. However, this did not 
happen. Probably, the president decided to "remain above the 
skirmish" for the time being. On the other hand, on the same day 
ambassador at large David Shakhnazaryan met with Russian and 
U.S. ambassadors and it may be assumed that these talks were far 
from simple. 
  In a private conversation with a person from the 
presidential 
entourage, Manucharyan himself expressed surprise at 
Siradegyan's action and stressed that he did not intend at all 
to go over to the opposition, but only aimed at strengthening 
the intellectual aspect in the discussion of the problem of 
Nagornyy Karabakh. 
  Meanwhile, there is no doubt that the "skirmish" will take 
place and very soon at that. Ambartsum Galstyan, Yerevan's 
former mayor, has already announced his intention to hold his 
own press conference and to expose the abuses in the system of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Moreover, many former members 
of the Karabakh Committee are preparing to make a joint 
statement. The parliamentary opposition is about to send a whole 
series of questions to the government and the procuracy. In 
turn, the procuracy is also not inclined to fulfill the 
minister's recommendations and to hastily institute criminal 
proceedings. As experience shows, the procurator-general, whose 
removal Siradegyan, in fact, demanded during the briefing, is 
not afraid to enter into complex relations with the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. Therefore, the retaliatory attack on 
Siradegyan promises to be a mass attack and the moment when the 
president will have to have his say in order to calm passions is 
inevitable. The piquancy of the existing situation lies in the 
fact that, according to the results of the quarrel, this say may 
by no means be in support of the still strong minister.

IZVESTIYA: "Between the Dram and a Tragedy"] 
  [Text] What keeps a man freezing in the street warm? 
The thought of a warm apartment, hot shower, and warm bed 
waiting for him. 
  In Yerevan these days, everything is in reverse. 
  It is depressing to return home from the frosty street. As 
to 
a cold bed, just the thought of it gives one the shivers. People 
here do not undress when they go to bed--on the contrary, they 
put on as many clothes as possible. Even a knit cap does not 
quite protect one from the feel of an icy pillow. People feel 
much colder in apartments at night than during the day in the 
street. 
  And this is not just for a day or two. A constant feeling of 
hunger is intolerable precisely because it is constant. 
  Many people here, including one of the authors of this 
article, have bluish, slightly swollen hands; even a slightly 
below freezing temperature causes them to swell and darken. It 
is not frostbite but the consequence of constant exposure. You 
acquire this condition in your apartment, not on the street. 
  Children and the elderly are the worst off, of course. 
Everybody in Armenia suffers, however, in their own way: the 
ordinary citizen, the family, the enterprise... And not just 
from the cold. 
<H5>  A 17-point Earthquake Is No Longer Frightening </H5>
  Only one person was working at the gigantic Masis Footwear 
Association in the middle of the weekday: General Director 
Rudolf Arutyunyan. In a gloomy mood, he was sitting in a 
spacious cold office, doing calculations that were making him 
even gloomier. 
  Until very recently, nobody ever saw him like this, and 
could 
not even imagine it. Energetic, self-assured seemingly under any 
circumstances--this was the familiar image of him. The 
enterprise, whose fame transcended the borders of Armenia, has 
now been idle for weeks. The entire collective has been sent on 
compulsory leave--first for last year, and immediately 
afterward--for the current one. 
  "First, we have no raw material..." explained Arutyunyan. 
  One could stop right there, as in a famous joke about the 
absence of bullets, but the point is that there is no one single 
problem facing Masis and Arutyunyan which, had it been solved, 
could make the situation easier. Yes, the leather tanning plant, 
idled because of the scheduled cut-off of electricity, will get 
back on line any moment now, and with this leather one could 
somehow resume making footwear. But even if a miracle happened 
and they began to get supply of lasts from Armavir, bottom parts 
for children's shoes from Chisinau, rubber from Ukraine, raw 
material and semifinished components from Kursk, Belarus, and 
Italy, how are they to pay for these supplies; how to transport 
the finished product; how to pay for incredibly expensive power 
and fuel? 
  A few years ago Masis produced 23 million pairs of excellent 
footwear a year, of which only 7 million remained in Armenia 
while the rest were exported. Right before the stoppage of 
production, annual output amounted to 5 million pairs, and now 
even this level is unlikely to be achieved. 
  Arutyunyan adds up what the steam from the boiler house will 
cost the enterprise, and how much transportation costs would be; 
the bottom line is that there is no way to make ends meet, and 
the enterprise cannot afford to operate at a loss. 
  What makes it even more painful for the director to suffer 
through inaction and lack of prospects is that he has at his 
disposal state-of-the-art equipment, as well as highly skilled 
world-class specialists and craftsmen. The reputation of 
Armenian footwear makers--as well as, by the way, clothes and 
rug makers--is high around the world. The largest foreign firms 
used to gladly enter into cooperation with local enterprises, 
deliver machinery and semifinished products, and create joint 
enterprises. The Masis trademark, for instance, was well known 
and commanded respect in the world market. Now all this is in 
the past. 
  "Of 138 large enterprises in our sector, only 38 are 
operating now," Minister of Light Industry Rudolf Teymurazyan 
told us. "Economic conditions make normal production impossible. 
Imagine, for instance, an eight- or nine-point earthquake; at 
this level a city is totally destroyed and the population dies; 
if the force of the earthquake keeps increasing and reaches, for 
instance, 17 points, it is not going to do any more damage than 
it already has. This analogy can be applied to our financial 
situation. Prices have shot into outer space. The gap between 
the level of production costs and wages, the cost of fuel and 
power, and the cost of transportation, on the one hand, and 
potential earnings on the other may now increase to any size 
without changing the situation. 
<H5>  What Am I To Buy With My Salary: Toothpaste or 10 Eggs? </H5>
  Putting together a family budget resembles the Masis 
director's sad calculations. The minimum wage in Armenia is 110 
drams; the average wage is 250 drams. The difference between 
them, however, much as between pensions and allowances on one 
hand and the president's salary on the other, is not that 
tangible. Prices are out of reach in relation to any local 
income. With the level of prices and the exchange rate, 100 
drams correspond to approximately one dollar. That is, most 
people here have a monthly income in the range of $1.5-3. 
  In the stores, and it is almost the same in farmers markets, 
a kilogram of beef costs 260 drams; butter--350-500 drams; 
sugar--90; onions--100-150; cheese--350; and sausage--450; a 
bottle of vodka costs 600 drams, champaign--800; a pack of 
cigarettes--between 10 (Astra) and 60 (Magna) drams; a tube of 
toothpaste--100; a bar of household soap--50; and 10 eggs--100 
drams. 
  So, after deducting apartment rent and the cost of public 
transportation, for one monthly salary one can buy here two 
packs of cigarettes, or 10 eggs, a tube of toothpaste, or 300 g 
of butter... 
  (Let us note in parentheses that here, too--although not as 
frequently as in Moscow--one can see people who have enough 
money to buy any food or other goods in expensive stores, and 
even patronize the rare casinos and restaurants. There are, of 
course, members of various sorts of mafia among them, which is 
tenacious everywhere, but for the most part they are people who 
do business outside Armenia, or their relatives. In Armenia 
itself it is almost impossible to operate a normal business 
now--limited and costly communications eat up any earnings.) 
  So, how do most people live, or rather, survive? 
  For most, the only affordable items are probably fish and 
bread, which is sold by coupons--350 g per person a day for half 
a dram. Potatoes used to be relatively cheap, but lately their 
prices have gone up considerably, and now they cost as much as 
oranges. This is the meager and monotonous ration that has now 
replaced the traditionally abundant Armenian table in most 
families. 
  There is one more expense item, as necessary as it is 
burdensome: candles and kerosene. 
<H5>  You Want To Build a House--Build a Hospital Next To It </H5>
  It is difficult to get used to cold and hunger, but people 
have no choice. They have lived without heating for so long that 
children who are beginning to talk do not know what the 
radiators in the apartment are for. Hot showers and baths are 
science fiction here. An attractive woman with traces of past 
grooming confessed to us that Whiskas advertising simply 
irritates her, but when she sees shampoo and bubble bath on the 
screen she gets hysterical. 
  Actually, watching television is a rare pastime for an 
Armenian these days. Electricity in apartments is turned on for 
an hour and a half a day. At least in the past the utility kept 
the schedule of "rolling switch-on" by microrayon; people could 
prepare for it and plan things in advance. Now the schedule is 
off quite frequently, and nobody knows when the lights will come 
on. They live in constant readiness for a sudden two-hour-long 
flash, during which you have to manage to accomplish everything: 
cook food, do the laundry, recharge a battery--for those who 
have one, heat water... Television is certainly not a priority 
at such moments. 
  People have to make do with candles and kerosene cookers. 
One 
candle costs 15 drams; a liter of kerosene--120 drams (as a 
reminder--the average monthly salary is 250 drams). Naturally, 
these sources are used only when absolutely necessary. 
  Everything that burns goes for heating, including books. It 
is rare to see a building entrance in Yerevan these days that 
has a door--they have all been used up as fuel. One increasingly 
sees stumps in place of trees in the city. 
  Lately, so-called "illegal plug-ins" have become widespread. 
All sorts of ingenious and sometimes very original devices 
enable city residents to plug into power lines supplying 
facilities that have a regular supply of power. A local joke: A 
man begins to build a house for himself, and at the same time a 
hospital next to it. He is asked: 
  "But why do you need a hospital?" 
  "For an `illegal plug-in'..." 
  Those who have left temporarily or for good to live in more 
hospitable places take a long time to shed the habits of Yerevan 
life. They take matches with them when they take a bath or visit 
a bathroom--to light a candle. They blow at a table lamp before 
going to bed. They jump when the lights are turned on in the 
apartment... 
  There are many who are leaving. First and foremost, they try 
to get the children out--not only to normal living conditions 
but also to an education. Schools and colleges are closed--at 
this point until spring. The fate of an entire generation--which 
means the nation's future--is in jeopardy. 
<H3>  It Is Cheaper To Stay Home Than Work, But Getting Divorced 
Is the Best </H3>
  If early retirement is an option, many leave work. The 
difference between any kind of pay, as we noted above, is of 
little substance, and when you stay home you save energy and 
money by eliminating transportation costs. 
  Pensions, unemployment benefits, and allowances for families 
with many children and single mothers are distributed through 
the Ministry of Labor and Social Security Services. Minister 
Ashot Esayan told us how meticulously this work is performed; he 
also told us that lately his staff have begun to uncover 
instances of fictitious divorces for the purpose of claiming 
single mother benefit. 
  Charitable aid coming to Armenia through various channels 
also is concentrated in this ministry and distributed by it. 
This is not an easy task, not only because there is not enough 
for everyone, but also because communications with the outside 
world are difficult. For instance, they received a shipment of 
kerosene cookers from the United States, but have not been able 
to get the accompanying kerosene out of Batimu. However, even 
moral support is of great significance here. 
  Here, by the way, is the account number where monetary aid 
may be sent. 
  Yerevan, Myasnikyanskiy State Commercial Bank, 141 635. 
<H5>  Not Only Unhappy Families Are Unhappy in Their Own Way </H5>
  One cannot explain Armenia's current troubles by the 
preponderance or the legacy of the party nomenklatura. Its 
members have been long removed from power. And the reforms and 
democratization initially proceeded here without delay and 
aggressively. Redistribution of land and decollectivization, for 
instance, were implemented earlier and on a larger scale than in 
other former Union republics. 
  But first an earthquake, and then Karabakh, the 
confrontation 
with Azerbaijan, and then destabilization in neighboring Georgia 
became factors that overrode everything else. 
  Separation from the ruble zone has affected Armenia more 
painfully than others. The national currency--the dram--is not 
becoming a full-fledged currency and is hampering opportunities 
both for enterprises and commercial traders. 
  Is a free market and liberalization in the economy possible 
at all in this situation? Would it not be more logical, as some 
opposition members suggest, to go the opposite way--tighten the 
administrative reins and centralize all resources and 
distribution channels? 
  "No," Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan told us. "Even 
in these conditions a market economy is much more viable. 
Expensive as food is, it is still available--and only because 
the main landowner is the private farmer rather than kolkhozes. 
We are now beginning privatization in other economic spheres as 
well. We will stop the production decline; as to the dram's 
exchange rate in relation to the dollar, we have already 
stabilized it. Of course, the situation in general is so hard 
for the populace that people's attitude toward the government in 
these circumstances cannot be positive. It is hard to be loved 
in these conditions. 
  The rating of the government, and of the president, has 
dropped perceptively lately. Many people who just recently were 
the president's ardent supporters now criticize him sharply. 
People are irritated both by the optimism frequently displayed 
by the prime minister and the extreme reserve in forecasts that 
has been lately characteristic of the president. 
  "How could Levon say something like this on New Year's 
Eve?!" 
we heard more than once. "As if it is not enough that families 
had such a meager holiday meal on the table--then the president 
added insult to injury by saying that it may get worse. How can 
it get any worse?" 
  While there is a perceptible shift in society's attitude 
toward the president and the government--despite the fact that 
there are no serious alternative forces in sight, because the 
room for maneuver in politics and economics is too small--when 
it comes to the question of Karabakh, the position remains the 
same and quite unshakeable. Nobody here questions the fight to 
take Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan, and the solidarity with 
Karabakh Armenians remains across the board and sincere. 
  Armenian Minister of Defense Serzh Sarkisyan is a civilian, 
a 
philologist by education. He fought in Karabakh, however, and 
has a reputation as a talented military commander. He reasserted 
to us that the Armenian army is not engaged in combat 
operations, but it is unthinkable to leave Karabakh residents 
without support. By the way, his own wife and children live in 
Stepanakert. 
  There is one more point on which probably all parties, 
movements, and all strata of society agree--the necessity to 
strengthen ties with Russia, the hopes for Russian aid. Many are 
inclined to idealize the situation in Russian politics and the 
economy--the difference in the standard of living and the 
stability of the two countries' currencies is just too great. 
<H5>  How Long Can One Keep Pushing a Trolley Bus? </H5>
  Peasants are today on much more solid ground than urban 
residents. We saw proof of this in Artashatskiy Rayon. As 
everywhere in Armenia, land here is mostly divided among 
individual owners. All in all there are more than 300,000 
private farms in the country--considerably more than in immense 
Russia. These farms are small--between one and 10 hectares. 
However, for such traditional sectors as viticulture and 
horticulture, this size is optimal. 
  Despite the high cost of fuel, fertilizer, and manufactured 
feed concentrates, as well as the general economic crisis, 
harvest yields are high. The yield of potatoes last year, for 
instance, amounted to 420,000 tonnes--a record over the past 10 
years. The decline in the size of livestock herd has been 
halted. The problem right now is not production but distribution 
of agricultural output. 
  In the same Artashatskiy Rayon, for instance, which is 
located quite close to Yerevan, it is still too costly for 
peasants to bring produce for sale in the capital. 
  This is precisely why, as Minister of Agriculture Ashot 
Voskanyan told us, the ministry also shifted from production 
management to organizing services for peasants, distributing 
their output, and pricing policy. 
  One way or the other, at least the countryside feeds itself 
well. Only a small part of the republic's population live there, 
however--most live in Yerevan and other major cities. But 
private farming's potential is sufficient to provide for all 
urban residents. And not only with respect to foodstuffs. 
  This is quite noticeable if one looks at enterprises 
processing local agricultural output. Director of the Aygorg rug 
factory Eduard Agadzhanov told us that since decollectivization 
to this day the problem of wool procurement has ceased to be a 
problem for him altogether. Private suppliers are much more 
reliable and provide better quality than state suppliers. 
  There is a score of enterprises of completely different 
specializations that have been able to find for themselves a way 
out of the incredibly difficult conditions and develop 
production. The Bazalt defense plant is setting up production of 
trolley buses and furniture; the famous Ararat cognac factory is 
expanding its distribution market; bakery plant No. 4 has 
doubled the output of bread... Nevertheless, the decline in the 
Armenian economy is serious and painful. It is not easy to get 
reliable statistics in this respect in Armenia itself: some data 
are classified, others differ tremendously from one another, or 
are frankly unrealistic. 
  According to experts of the Moscow center SovEcon, the 
picture looks like this: According to preliminary estimates the 
gross domestic product for last year will amount to only 38 
percent of the 1990 level, while in Russia, for instance, it 
will amount to 57.6 percent, in neighboring Azerbaijan--48 
percent, and in the CIS as a whole--55.5 percent; the volume of 
industrial production--30.5 percent, in agriculture--55 percent, 
and in construction--20 percent. In all other indicators Armenia 
is also considerably behind both Russia and the CIS. 
  Meanwhile, outside the gates of even relatively well-to-do 
enterprises there are streets with very few cars, because 
gasoline is very expensive. Streets down which where one sees 
people dragging bundles of firewood and brushwood. Here and 
there one gets a glimpse of a scene that would be 
incomprehensible, for instance, to a Muscovite: Passengers are 
pushing a trolley bus, and only this way getting through what is 
quite often a considerable part of the route going through a 
microrayon where the electricity has been turned off--to an area 
where there is light.

<F P=106> [Edict of the President of the Republic of Armenia: "On </F>
Additional Measures for Creating Favorable Conditions for the 
Importation and Sale of Food Products in the Republic of 
Armenia"] 
  [Text] In view of the tension that has arisen in 
recent days on the republic's consumer market and considering 
the need to overcome bureaucratic red tape and to create 
favorable conditions for the importation into the republic and 
the sale of food products and fuel, and attaching great 
importance to the tasks of the most effective implementation of 
a number of decrees adopted by the Government of the Republic of 
Armenia and the state commission for the regulation of monetary 
turnover in the recent period directed to putting monetary 
turnover into good order and regularizing foreign trade, I 
DECREE that: 
  1. The Government of the Republic of Armenia is instructed 
and it is proposed to the Central Bank of Armenia to discuss and 
make the necessary changes within a week in decrees of the 
Government of the Republic of Armenia and the Central Bank of 
Armenia No. 383 of 26 July, No. 402 of 30 July, No. 519 of 13 
October 1993 and in decree of the Government of the Republic of 
Armenia No. 520 of 13 October 1993, having as its object the 
maximum facilitation of the importation into the republic and 
sale of food products and fuel, having provided for the most 
favorable conditions for the establishment of foreign economic 
ties for the individual entrepreneurs and other persons engaged 
in economic activity who have been attracted into this business. 
In the matter of the obligatory sale of the foreign currency 
funds obtained to the Government of the Republic of Armenia, a 
differentiated approach is to be developed to ensure the 
continuous replenishment of the working capital of enterprises 
and organizations and the conducting of normal economic activity. 
  2. The Government of the Republic of Armenia, jointly with 
the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia, is, within five 
days, to discuss the question of the need to review the 
temporary prohibition on the conducting of trading transactions 
in cash established by paragraph six of decree of the Government 
of the Republic of Armenia and the Central Bank of Armenia No. 
383 of 26 July 1993. 
  3. In view of the fact that conflicting interpretations have 
arisen in the implementation of the decree of the Government of 
the Republic of Armenia of 26 November 1993 "On the Exemption 
from the Value Added Tax of Individual Types of Food Products 
and Certain Children's Goods Being Sold to the Population in the 
Territory of the Republic of Armenia," the State Tax 
Inspectorate of the Republic of Armenia is instructed to extend 
the above-mentioned decree of the Govermment of the Republic of 
Armenia to the wholesale and retail trade in butter, vegetable 
oil, sugar, granulated sugar, margarine, groats, cheese and 
powdered milk both produced in the Republic of Armenia and 
imported into the Republic of Armenia, having fully exempted the 
importation and sale (trade) of these goods from the value added 
tax. 
  4. The Government of the Republic of Armenia is instructed, 
within five days, to establish a suitable procedure in the 
Zvarnots [as transliterated] and Erebuni [as transliterated] 
airports of the Republic of Armenia so as to preclude the 
formation of any artificial barriers to the reception of cargo 
planes in the republic, the organization of return flights, and 
the importation of food products and other cargoes. 
  The attention of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the 
Customs Administration of the Republic of Armenia, and the 
leadership of the Main Civil Aviation Administration under the 
Government of the Republic of Armenia is to be drawn to the 
enormous state importance of this question and the need to 
create conditions of the severest intolerance as regards any 
illegal action. 
  5. It is to be established that, beginning 20 December 1993, 
any organ of executive power is to be prohibited from conducting 
checks in organizations (irrespective of the form of ownership) 
importing into the republic and selling food products without 
the special permission of the Government of Armenia. The 
above-mentioned organizations are strictly bound, in accordance 
with the procedure established by law, to submit a quarterly 
report to the appropriate organs of the State Tax Inspectorate 
of the Republic of Armenia on the overall results of the 
economic activity they have conducted and in conformity with 
this on the status of the payment of state taxes. 
  The Government of the Republic of Armenia is to establish 
the 
procedure for checking the quality of food products being 
imported and sanitary fitness. 
  6. The Government of the Republic of Armenia, within two 
weeks, is to specially consider the overall situation which has 
arisen in the airports of the Republic of Armenia resulting from 
the need for the reliable organization of flights, the 
fundamental improvement of the business of transporting 
passengers and freight, and the establishment of suitable 
procedure in the area of financial and economic activity. 
  7. The Monitoring (kontrolnyy) Service under the President 
of 
the Republic of Armenia is to report every 15 days on the course 
of the implementation of the present Edict. 
  [Signed] L. Ter-Petrosyan 
  President of the Republic of 
Armenia

<F P=106> [Article by Aram Tarakchyan, chief of the foreign </F>
investments department of the Ministry of Economics of the 
Republic of Armenia: "A Technologies Market Needs to be Created 
In Armenia"] 
  [Text] The department of foreign investments was 
created four months ago in the Ministry of Economics of the 
Republic of Armenia. The chief of this department, Aram 
TARAKCHYAN, characterizes the situation with foreign investments 
in Armenia like this. 
  The department is not engaged in procuring foreign 
investments. Our goal is the creation of conditions so that 
investments would come into Armenia without the help of the 
president or the prime minister. To do this one needs to know 
how and for what purpose investments are made in the world. It 
is necessary to create a mechanism for the support and 
encouragement of investments. The principle of supporting 
investors is clear and common the world over: a favorable 
legislative field. In this case our task is clear: to adopt such 
laws. Encouragement is another matter. In this case the presence 
of a well thought-out and considered program specially for 
Armenia is required. 
  Official letters of proposals with invitations to foreigners 
to make investments were sent from Armenia to various addresses 
in the past. Not a single positive reply has been received up to 
this day. The reason, it seems, is in the lack of information 
about investment processes. 
  Investments can first of all secure for us the fruits of the 
work of the scientific and technological thought of Armenia. 
  Today the Japanese are successfully selling the "Narine" [as 
transliterated; not further identified] on the international 
market. However, this is not the "Narine" purchased from us but 
one which they have made over and brought up to the requirements 
of world production standards. We have not been able to achieve 
this despite the fact that we have received the tens of 
thousands of dollars due us and the Japanese have offered us 
cooperation. 
  Intellectual property--these are resources which are not 
exhausted when sold but augmented. One needs simply to learn the 
way to enrich them by sale. Today in Armenia there are several 
score of new technologies of the "Narine" level and several 
hundreds of technical and technological research and development 
projects which may interest foreign investors. 
  The first and most important investment program is a program 
for the creation of a technologies market in Armenia. 
  This program cannot be created by a single step, by a single 
order or other administrative act. The components of the market 
must arise and function by stages. The following steps are 
essential: 
  a) creation of an information bank which will include 
various 
kinds of information on research and development projects and 
inventions being brought about in Armenia that are promising 
from the technological viewpoint. Use of this bank should 
require payment. It will make it possible for everyone who is 
interested to become familiar with a research and development 
project or technology; 
  b) creation of a small group of 200-300 innovation 
consultant 
specialists--the connecting link between the information system 
and those who need the technologies, their potential customers. 
A mutual influence of the supply and demand for intellectual 
property is thus created. This is the basis of the market; 
  c) development of the basic directions of the government's 
scientific and technical innovation policy. In this case many of 
those whom the state now finances free of charge as scientific 
workers will switch to that system of financing which directly 
serves the creation of new technologies. 
  If there are all these components, there will also be a 
technologies market and only then will foreign investors be able 
to carry out investments here.

<F P=106> [Article by Rem Ananikyan, Artur-M Scientific Analysis </F>
Center: "The Important Thing Is That Armenia and Georgia Are 
Brothers in Spirit and Blood: On the Bridge of History"] 
  [Text] The paradox is that after living next to each other 
for thousands of years, Armenians and Georgians do not know each 
other very well and display an unforgivable indifference to 
studying the history and culture of the neighboring people. 
Really, what does an "average" Armenian know about Georgia? That 
during the times of Tigran the Great part of the territory of 
modern Georgia was subject to the "king of kings"? That the 
ancient Georgian alphabet was invented by a disciple of Mesrop 
Mashtone, and Tbilisi was built by Armenians? That Georgians are 
noble, gay, careless, and vainglorious people but to this day 
have not learned how to really make shish kebab? 
  And what can the "average" Georgian say about his Armenian 
neighbors? That under Queen Tamara Armenia was part of Georgia; 
that Armenians constantly lay claim on the great Shota Rustaveli 
as their own; that they are calculating, stingy, and cunning 
people, and generally, why do they not go back to Armenia? 
  In reality, however, how rich and interesting are the 
interconnections between the two peoples! How many glorious 
pages of joint struggle against foreign invaders has their 
history registered! 
  How is it that, surrounded by a hostile Muslim environment, 
Orthodox Georgia and Apostolic Armenia have managed to preserve 
their language, culture, spiritual values, and faith? This is 
the amazing historic phenomenon to which our researchers should 
turn their attention first and foremost. We should look for the 
roots of the strength of the brotherhood of two peoples, which 
has not been weakened over time, in ancient manuscripts and 
wonderful samples of miniature painting. 
  It is not surprising that the news of the collapse of 
Armenian statehood was perceived by Georgia with alarm and pain. 
The country was losing its ally, protection at the approaches to 
its borders. Its hard for many to understand today why Georgian 
people extended so much warm and heartfelt hospitality to 
Armenians fleeing the devastating invasion of Seljuk Turks. They 
settled in one of the plentiful regions in Georgia--Kakhetia, 
with its capital of Telavi. And to this day thousands of 
descendants of those remote resettlers live and prosper in this 
land famous for its wines. 
  In Tbilisi, which by then was already the main city in the 
Transcaucasus, Armenians were greeted with expansive 
hospitality. Most of them were merchants, gunsmiths, jewelers, 
stone masons, and other craftsmen, which in many respects 
contributed to economic progress in Georgia and expansion of its 
ties with Asia Minor and then with Russia and West European 
countries. 
  According to the testimony of A.S. Pushkin, who visited the 
Russian-Turkish front in 1829, "in Tiflis [Tbilisi] most of the 
population is comprised of Armenians: they accounted for up to 
2,500 families in 1825. During the current fighting the numbers 
have grown. It is estimated that there are up to 1,500 Georgian 
families (See "Journey to Erzurum"). 
  Naturally, Armenians made a serious contribution to the 
development of the Georgian capital and its cultural life. 
Suffice it to mention the Ovnatanyan dynasty of artists, whose 
creative life in Tbilisi spanned over 200 years beginning in 
1661, when Czar Vakhtang the Sixth invited Nagash Ovnatanyan to 
his court. Nagash's grandson Ovtnatan was Irakliy the Second's 
court painter. Many people do not know that artist Mikirtum 
Ovnatanyan did the murals of the famous Sioni cathedral. 
  The peasant reform of 1864 sped up the development of 
capitalism in the Transcaucasus. Gradually a considerable part 
of industry, including oil production, as well as trade became 
concentrated in the hands of the Armenian bourgeoisie. This is 
when strains appeared in Armenian-Georgian relations. This is 
when rivalry developed between the Armenian bourgeoisie and 
Georgian nobility, which had a negative impact on interethnic 
relations. This period in the life of Georgia has been aptly 
portrayed in Tsigareli's comedy "Khanuma." 
  At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century 
Tbilisi developed rapidly, becoming one of the most beautiful 
cities in the Russian empire. An enormous contribution in city 
planning and development was made by major industrialists and 
benefactors Mantashev, Aramyants, Melik-Kazaryan, Bozardzhyan, 
and others. Dozens of newspapers, magazines, and books were 
published in Armenian; a theological seminary opened. The 
national party Dashnaktsutyun was also founded in Tbilisi at the 
junction of the two centuries. 
  At the same time, the changes in social and public life and 
the advent of capitalist relations that were basically alien to 
the patriarchal way of life could not fail to create fertile 
soil for stronger Armenian-Georgian rivalry, which sometimes 
assumed acute forms. The behavior of certain strata of the 
Armenian population inevitably caused disapproval among the 
Georgian public. Some Armenian scholars sometimes committed 
missteps by clearly exaggerating the role and place of Armenians 
in the history of the Georgian nation. 
  Neither were some Georgian thinkers particularly noted for 
their objectivity. In the most concentrated form this 
anti-Armenian mood was expressed by Georgian literary classic 
Ilya Chavchavadze. The great poet came out with the book 
"Armenian Scholars or Crying Stones," in which he accused 
Armenian historians and writers of all mortal sins and insulted 
the entire Armenian nation. His sense of proportion 
unfortunately failed the great patriot, and his emotions 
overrode objective and impartial evaluation. I. Chavchavadze's 
book went beyond the bounds of scholarly debate, for which it 
was justly criticized by an outstanding scholar, Academician 
Nikolay Marr, who was, by the way, a Georgian by his maternal 
line. 
  Armenian-Georgian friendship was put to a severe test in 
1918-1920. At the time of Turkish invasion of Transcaucasus in 
1918, the Menshevik government of Georgia occupied Loriyskiy 
District. Over the period of 1,000 years of neighborly 
coexistence between Armenia and Georgia there were no wars--a 
unique fact in human history. The Georgian-Armenian war (13-31 
December 1918) was provoked from outside, by dark political 
forces. 
  In the 1930's there were quite a few Armenians in top-level 
positions in Georgia. Gradually they were replaced by Georgian 
national cadres. Unfortunately, ethnic policy in Georgia became 
biased with the advent to power of L. Beria, who never hid his 
anti-Armenian views. 
  Nevertheless, we can say that the friendship between the 
Georgian and Armenian people withstood the test of time. This is 
supported by numerous examples of extending mutual help and 
special relations of trust. Armenia will never forget that 
during the tragic Spitak earthquake the first help to arrive in 
the disaster zone was from Georgia. Probably the only people to 
show moral support to Georgia after the bloody events on 
Rustaveli Prospect, when Tbilisi residents died of the hand of 
brutal soldiers, were Armenians. They embodied their solidarity 
in a monument erected in the courtyard of the Armenian church in 
Avlabar. 
  Georgia today is the only route for food and fuel to reach 
blockaded Armenia. Some political circles in the region and 
outside it are artificially inflaming interethnic strife, using 
the complex political situation in the Transcaucasus. And 
political instability in Georgia immediately impacts in a most 
unfavorable way on Armenia. 
  Therefore, any misunderstandings that arise must be removed 
quickly. This is, by the way, one of the most important and 
auspicious tasks of the recently created "Armenia-Georgia" 
society.

<F P=106> ["New Year Message of Greetings to the People From the </F>
President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Geydar Aliyev"] 
  [Text] Esteemed countrymen, sisters and brothers! Greetings 
on the coming new year 1994! Today is the Day of Solidarity of 
Azeris throughout the world. I greet the Azeris throughout the 
world on this momentous day and wish for them to cooperate even 
more closely in the future! 
  The year 1993, which is drawing to an end, has been a 
difficult one for the Azeri people, for our republic. Complex 
sociopolitical processes have evolved in the life of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan this year; certain changes have occurred. 
The war that has resulted from aggression by the Armenian Armed 
Forces has continued; some of our lands have been occupied; many 
citizens of Azerbaijan have been forced to leave the locations 
of their permanent residence and become refugees. This year, the 
Republic of Azerbaijan has been going through a profound 
economic and social crisis. We may say with complete confidence 
and a feeling of tremendous pride that our people and our 
republic have come out of these difficulties and trials 
worthily, and are looking to the year 1994 with confidence. 
  The year 1993 has been marked by complex collisions in the 
socioeconomic life of the republic. A confrontation between 
various groups and the striving of separatist forces to 
dismember Azerbaijan have disrupted sociopolitical stability in 
the republic, which by the middle of the year ended up on the 
very brink--at the threshold of a civil war. We might say that a 
civil war has already started, that the blood of brethren has 
been shed in some regions of Azerbaijan, which has worsened 
tensions within the republic. However, the people have once 
again displayed their wisdom, and prevented a civil war. The 
confrontation has been eliminated, and the separatist forces 
endeavoring to dismember Azerbaijan have been neutralized. By 
now, our republic is already solving its problems under stable 
and quiet conditions. 
  This year, our republic has tried to stop the onslaught of 
the Armenian Armed Forces. Unfortunately, we have suffered 
defeats, and some territories have been lost. Our citizens who 
have become refugees as a result of the occupation of 
Azerbaijani lands by the Armenian Armed Forces have been 
resettled in other regions of the republic. At present, there 
are more than 1 million refugees in Azerbaijan. This has 
produced extreme tensions in the position of Azerbaijan as a 
whole, and in particular in the situation within the republic. 
  However, it should be noted that the situation has now 
changed. In recent months, we have witnessed major changes, 
which have resulted from the efforts made to raise an army in 
the republic, strengthen discipline in it, and securely protect 
our lands. The units of the Army of Azerbaijan, our heroic 
warriors are now securely protecting our territories, displaying 
exemplary heroism, worthily responding to attacks by the 
Armenian Armed Forces, and striking blows at that. We can say 
with a feeling of satisfaction that in recent months, all 
attempts by Armenian Armed Forces have been defeated; their 
offensives have been turned back. The Armed Forces of our 
republic are securely defending the positions taken by them and 
are proving to the Armenian Armed Forces the degree to which the 
force and might of the Republic of Azerbaijan have increased. 
  At present, heavy fighting is under way on all fronts, 
through the fault of the Armenian Armed Forces. We have said 
repeatedly, and I will repeat again, that our state comes out in 
favor of a peaceful withdrawal from this war, from the woes that 
have befallen Azerbaijan. We have taken several steps in this 
direction, and today we are proclaiming our position again. I 
think that these steps of ours should produce results. At the 
same time, the Republic of Azerbaijan has already been able to 
boost its military might, and our people may be completely 
confident that the Army of Azerbaijan will be able to take the 
necessary measures to ensure the secure defense of the republic 
and to regain the occupied lands in the future, too. 
  War goes on, fighting goes on, and our people suffer losses. 
This is natural. Today, just as in the beginning of the year, 
the valiant sons of the Azeri people become martyrs and die as 
they defend our lands in front-line regions. Today, on the eve 
of this holiday, I express my condolences to the families, 
relatives, and loved ones of the fallen. I admire the courage of 
the heroic sons of Azerbaijan. May Allah bless all those who 
have sacrificed themselves, and may their graves be filled with 
light [the previous sentence is rendered in Azeri in the 
original]. May Allah grant patience to their families. 
  I think that our people are capable of enduring these severe 
trials. At present, on this holiday, I send my holiday greetings 
to soldiers and officers and all our citizens who are 
steadfastly and heroically fighting at the front; I greet them 
on the occasion of New Year's day. I wish them health and 
success in doing their sacred duty. 
  The war has borne bitter fruits, and it is still bearing 
them. The number of refugees has increased as a result of the 
aggression of the Armenian Armed Forces. As I address the 
refugees, the esteemed citizens of Azerbaijan, I send my 
greetings on the occasion of New Year's day. Indeed, it is the 
tradition of our people for each citizen to mark the New Year 
holiday in his own home, at the native hearth. Unfortunately, a 
majority of our citizens have lost warm shelter, houses, and 
hearths, and have been put up in various rayons. However, the 
refugees, wherever they might be, should know that our people 
care for them deeply, and the state looks after them. No matter 
how sad they are and what hardships they are experiencing, I 
wish them to be in a holiday mood today. 
  Our republic is going through a difficult crisis. The 
socioeconomic crisis is associated, on one hand, with the war 
that has been going on for about six years, and on the other 
hand, it has been due to certain objective and subjective 
causes. All of these were the reasons for a decline in the 
welfare of our people, who are now in a difficult situation. 
However, we know that our people are patient, and that they will 
endure these difficulties, too. The distressing year 1993 will 
end, and in 1994 a turnaround will occur in the development of 
our economy; the welfare of the people will improve with every 
passing day. 
  Today, on the Day of Solidarity of Azeris throughout the 
world, I wish all Azeris to have unity and solidarity. The 
solidarity of Azeris on the territory of the independent 
Republic of Azerbaijan is needed to this end first of all. The 
second year of independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan is now 
ending. This is not too long a period of time. These two years 
have been a difficult time for our republic. We are proceeding 
toward a third anniversary of our independence. We are facing 
great tasks, to accomplish which our people and the Republic of 
Azerbaijan will need unity and solidarity of all citizens. If 
all of our citizens, all Azeris residing in our republic, manage 
to create a genuine atmosphere of accord, we will be able to 
achieve unity among Azeris throughout the world. 
  This is why I appeal to our people for solidarity, I appeal 
for patience. I would like to assure you that the coming year 
1994 will be a year of great changes and great accomplishments 
for the Republic of Azerbaijan. I repeat: We are now securely 
protecting our Motherland, our lands. We strive to lead 
Azerbaijan out of the state of war, to put an end to this war, 
withdraw from it in a peaceful manner. We have taken a multitude 
of steps to this end, and we will take them in the future. On 20 
December, in Paris, I signed the Paris Charter on behalf of the 
Azeri people. We have thus demonstrated yet again to the entire 
world the adherence of the Republic of Azerbaijan to peace, 
tranquility, and security. 
  We are supporters of peace. However, along with this we 
reinforce our defense forces and strive, and will continue to 
strive, to ensure the recovery of the occupied lands of 
Azerbaijan. Our people can be sure that all measures will be 
taken to ensure the territorial integrity of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan and the inviolability of our borders. 
  You, dear citizens, dear brothers and sisters, may be 
certain 
that in 1994 our occupied lands will be recovered at any price. 
The refugees will return to their homes, to their dwellings. The 
territorial integrity and state sovereignty of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan will be fully upheld. 
  Once again, I greet all of you on the occasion of New Year's 
day. I wish all citizens of Azerbaijan to have peace, 
tranquility, prosperity, happiness in personal life, and success 
in all of your endeavors. 
  Good bye! Happy New Year!

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Will We Be Reading Newspapers?"] </F>
  [Text] The first business days of the new year were marked 
by numerous calls to the editorial office from both our readers 
and subscribers to various Moscow publications. All of them were 
concerned about the same issue--will they receive the newspapers 
to which they have subscribed in the current year, or does an 
information vacuum lie in store for them yet again? 
  The editorial office has already informed our readers about 
the reasons for the irregular publication of VYSHKA in the last 
two months of last year. The lack of special plates for 
newspaper printing at the "Azerbaijan" publishing house is the 
reason. The management of "Azerbaijan" has now promised to 
ensure the publication of our newspaper once a week--on 
Saturday. The editorial office itself "arranged" the plates for 
today's issue. We understand that this report cannot make our 
readers happy in any way. However, such is the situation. 
  As far as the Moscow publication to which the residents of 
our republic have subscribed, the situation is not particularly 
happy, either. The press distribution company Gasid has informed 
us that they have still been unable to transfer to Moscow the 
funds received for subscriptions. However, Moscow has promised 
to send publications printed there to subscribers, so to say, on 
credit in January. As for other newspapers that should be 
printed at the printing plant of the "Azerbaijan" publishing 
house, the situation is unclear for now, because of a shortage 
of the necessary quantity of the already mentioned plates.

<F P=106> [Comments by Suren Zolyan, deputy to the VS RA [Republic of </F>
Armenia Supreme Soviet], as reported by M. Grigoryan: "Rumors 
About Azerbaijan's Arms Have Proved to Be Understated"] 
  [Text] Reports that Azerbaijan has been supplied 
intensively with weapons and combat equipment by various 
countries have been filtering into the press lately. In 
particular, it reached the point this September that the MID RA 
[Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs] issued a statement 
concerning the tanks given to Azerbaijan by Ukraine. We have 
asked Suren Zolyan, deputy to the Republic of Armenia Supreme 
Soviet, to comment on new facts which became known a day or two 
ago. 
  Not long ago the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
officially confirmed the press reports that Ukraine had shipped 
a large consignment of tanks to this country. This official 
letter from the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also 
confirmed indirectly by the fact that the maximum level of arms 
for the Azerbaijan army permitted under international agreements 
has been substantially exceeded, inasmuch as the amount of 
equipment and number of artillery systems provided by Russia was 
indicated in another letter. These documents were disseminated 
by the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs within the 
framework of the agreement in effect--the so-called OVSE 
[Conventional Armed Forces in Europe], which provides first of 
all for the maximum levels of weapons according to individual 
types of combat equipment for each member country of the SBSYe 
[CSCE: Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe], and 
secondly, the system for notification and information about the 
presence of their forces. First I will read out these official 
documents. 
  In letter No. 174 of 3 November 1993, the Azerbaijan 
Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs "has the honor to inform the joint 
consultative group for the OVSE that the Republic of Azerbaijan 
received 50 T-55 battle tanks from Ukraine on 27 September 
1993." Moreover, inasmuch as the OVSE had information on the 
weapons which Russia transferred to Azerbaijan, the following is 
indicated in letter No. 175 of 6 November 1993, "In July and 
August 1992, the Russian Federation transferred, and the 
Republic of Azerbaijan accepted under its jurisdiction, the 
following number of weapons and equipment restricted by the 
agreement: 286 battle tanks, 842 armored combat vehicles, 346 
artillery systems, 53 combat aircraft, and eight attack 
helicopters." The same letter states further: "In May 1993 (that 
is, this year--editor), the Republic of Azerbaijan received 105 
armored combat vehicles and 42 artillery systems from the 
Russian Federation." 
  Three comments need to be made about these letters. First of 
all, this exceeds the maximum level of weapons stipulated by the 
agreements. Secondly, a number of resolutions by international 
organs, the CSCE and the UN Security Council in particular, have 
been violated. And thirdly, this information is inaccurate (why 
is stated below). 
  I want to cite the maximum levels of weapons stipulated by 
the Budapest Agreement for the USSR as a whole, which were 
divided among the former union republics proportionately after 
its collapse. Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia were granted an 
equal number of maximum levels. I emphasize "maximum level," 
inasmuch as this number may actually be much lower, as in the 
case of Armenia, for example. 
  Thus the Republic of Azerbaijan could have no more than 220 
battle tanks. But in fact, it received 286 in 1992 and 105 in 
May this year from Russia, plus 50 from Ukraine in September. It 
could have no more than 220 armored combat vehicles. Practically 
four times as many were received: 842 were transferred in July 
and August. Further. It could have no more than 285 artillery 
systems. Let us count them: 346 shipped in July and August, that 
is, 1.5 times as many, plus 42 in May this year. Once again, 
this is substantially in excess of authorized levels. To be more 
precise, this agreement and protocol were signed in Tashkent on 
15 May 1992. 
  So there has been a significant violation of the OVSE 
agreement by three countries participating in the agreement: 
Azerbaijan, Russia, and Ukraine. 
  Why do I think the data provided by Azerbaijan are 
inaccurate? Take note of this: they begin the count in July and 
August 1992. We know that beginning in December 1991, a vast 
number of weapons located in Azerbaijan were seized at random 
and that a large quantity of weapons were also transferred to 
this country in May and June 1992. But all this is not being 
pointed out. So these data are not authentic. Moreover, the 
weapons Azerbaijan received from neighboring states through 
other channels were not mentioned, either. 
  It should also be stressed that the KSDL [Committee of 
Senior 
Officials] of the CSCE adopted the first decision on Karabakh on 
28 February 1992, in which it stated that arms should not be 
delivered to the conflicting sides in the region. This was 
repeatedly confirmed in other documents of the CSCE, so it is 
obvious that the agreement has been violated since July and 
August last year as well. As far as Ukraine is concerned, it is 
violating the UN Security Council decisions, where there is a 
corresponding paragraph prohibiting arms deliveries to the 
region of the conflict (No. 822 and subsequent resolutions) in 
addition to this. 
  It is interesting that Russia transferred weapons to the 
Republic of Azerbaijan in May this year, when the anti-Elchibey 
revolt of S. Guseynov began. This fact was not mentioned, 
although it is obvious that it definitely contributed to 
destabilization of the situation and continuation of the 
conflict. The vast number of weapons--and I think the official 
figures should be doubled--contributed to escalation of the 
hostilities, of course. In particular, the weapons transferred 
in May 1992 led directly to the seizure of Mardakert and 
Shaumyan rayons, which brought the armed conflict to a 
completely new level. 
  The events of this year are a logical continuation of those 
military operations which began as the result of the vast supply 
of arms provided to Azerbaijan. It seems to me that the 
competent organizations should draw their conclusions and 
evaluate these facts. They graphically demonstrate what 
Azerbaijan is counting on and who is contributing to the 
conflict, incidentally.

<F P=106> [Article by R. Gavrielyan: "...But Our Interests Are Dearer"] </F>
  [Text] A total of 28 parties are presently registered in 
Azerbaijan. A month ago there were 29 of them. After Aliyev was 
elected Azerbaijan's president, he immediately issued an edict 
on the banning of the Talysh People's Democratic Party. This was 
done after the proclamation on 12 August of the Talysh-Mugan 
Republic, which existed for 2 weeks on the territory of the 
Lenkoran Region in Azerbaijan. 
  Of the 28 political parties,several leading ones, which are 
among Azerbaijan's most influential political forces, can be 
singled out at present. They enjoy the support of entrepreneurs, 
the intelligentsia, and a significant part of the population. 
  The Musavat Party is the oldest party, which has its own 
history (except for the communist party). 
  The Musavat Bourgeois-Nationalist Party was formed in Baku 
in 
1911 under the name of the Musavat Moslem Democratic Party. M. 
Rasul-zade, G. Sharif-zade, and others were its founders. The 
program was based on ideas of pan-Turkism and pan-Islamism. The 
program envisaged the establishment of a single Turkic-Moslem 
state under Turkey's auspices with an inclusion of Azerbaijan's 
territory. After the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Russia 
in February 1917 the Musavat Party united with the Turkish Party 
of Federalists. At the united congress held on 1 October 1917, 
at which the program was adopted with small changes, the party 
began to be called the Federalist-Musavatist Turkish Democratic 
Party. Its social composition was heterogeneous. It included 
both big businessmen and the nationalistically disposed 
intelligentsia. 
  In Tbilisi in early May 1918 the Musavatist Party formed its 
government and on 27 May proclaimed Azerbaijan an independent 
state. 
  In early June 1918 this Musavatist government was 
established 
in Gyandzha (Kirovabad). With England's help it continued its 
struggle for power and as early as 15 September of the same 
year, after the overthrow of the Soviet regime, power was 
formally transferred to Musavatists. In fact, however, a Turkish 
military dictatorship was established in the republic. 
  Having become the ruling party, the Musavatist Party of 
Azerbaijan began to pursue an antinational policy. During its 
rule (1918-1920) mutual relations with Armenia, which were based 
on territorial disputes, became extremely aggravated. 
  The Musavatist government of Azerbaijan kept three-quarters 
of its military contingent on the border with Armenia. It 
incited Armenian pogroms in Baku, Karabakh, and Gyandzha. 
  Soviet rule was proclaimed in Azerbaijan on 30 April 1920. 
Many members of the Musavat Party emigrated to Turkey. 
  It was reestablished in Azerbaijan only in November 1992. 
The 
number of party members is about 5,000. The intelligentsia is 
the basic contingent. It includes about 1,500 instructors at 
higher educational institutions, 140 scientists, and 100 
representatives of the creative intelligentsia. Isa Gambarov 
(Isa Gambar), now former chairman of Azerbaijan's parliament, 
was elected head of Musavat. After Aliyev's coming to power Isa 
Gambarov was arrested. However, under public pressure he was 
released. 
  In the spring of 1992 Etibar Mamedov established the Party 
of 
National Independence of Azerbaijan, which is in opposition to 
the ruling regime. 
  Etibar Mamedov's personality is very remarkable. He is 
candidate of historical sciences and is one of the founders of 
the former Azerbaijan People's Front. In the leadership of the 
Azerbaijan People's Front he headed the radical wing. Since 
January 1990 he has been an active member of the Committee on 
National Defense established by the Azerbaijan People's Front, 
for which he was arrested and held in custody in the Moscow 
Matrosskaya Tishina prison. Mamedov often stated that the 
Karabakh problem can be solved only in a military-political way. 
Military or political measures will not solve the problem 
separately. 
  With regard to the status of Nagorno Karabakh, the question 
of which can be the subject of discussion during negotiations 
with Armenia, E. Mamedov often declared that "Azerbaijan's 
territorial integrity must be preserved. The security and rights 
of the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh are the main 
questions. Any proposals and plans, where international 
organizations or great powers would act as guarantors, can be 
discussed here. 
  "The act on the republic's independence clearly states that 
Azerbaijan is a unitary state. According to this document, the 
establishment of any state formations within Azerbaijan is 
impossible. Hypothetically, this matter can be the subject of 
discussion provided Armenia agrees to the return of 200,000 
(164,000) Azerbaijanis, who lived on its territory prior to 
1988, and enables them to establish their autonomy there." 
  In the opinion of leaders of the Party of National 
Independence of Azerbaijan, any leader of the state, first of 
all, must see to it that normal relations with its neighbors be 
established. These relations depend on the internal situation of 
the state. Azerbaijan has resources for the development of 
all-around normal ties with all neighboring states, except, of 
course, Armenia. 
  "We must take the interests of other states into 
consideration, but place our own above all." 
  Observers believe that E. Mamedov did not receive the chair 
of prime minister, since G. Aliyev wanted to offer him the post 
of secretary of state with the subordination of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs to him. To all appearances, however, E. Mamedov 
rejected this proposal. 
  The Party of National Independence did not participate in 
presidential elections scheduled for 3 October on the basis of 
the results of the vote of confidence in President Abdulfaz 
Elchibey. This decision was adopted at the congress of the Party 
of National Independence. The congress resolution notes that, 
having scheduled elections for 3 October, the authorities 
violated the schedules and procedural norms specified by the law 
on presidential elections. The document also stresses that the 
Party of National Independence sees the way out of the internal 
political crisis in Azerbaijan not in presidential elections, 
but in the formation of a state council, which would include 
representatives of all political forces. The congress came out 
in favor of the most rapid holding of new parliamentary 
elections.

<F P=106> [Article by Seyfali Akhundov under the rubric "Ins and Outs: </F>
"Karabakh Conflict Becomes International"] 
  [Text] The Russian mass media have already reported on 
plans of the British military to send a group of mercenaries to 
Azerbaijan. They have been limited here, however, to a reprint 
of Tim Kelsey's article "British Mercenaries in the Azerbaijan 
War" in the newspaper THE INDEPENDENT. Our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA 
correspondent became aware of additional facts. 
  In conversation with the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, 
Thomas Yang, Great Britain's ambassador to Baku, denied any 
military contacts whatsoever between the United Kingdom and 
Azerbaijan. It is known, however, that Thomas Yang was present 
at talks between British officials and the Azerbaijan military. 
Major Steven Harrison, military attache of Great Britain in 
Russia and simultaneously the acting chief military 
representative in embassies of the United Kingdom in several 
republics of the former USSR, met several times in December 1993 
with Azerbaijan's Minister of Defense Mammedrafi Mamedov. 
Harrison confirmed to OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's correspondent the 
existence of plans for participation by the British military in 
the Karabakh conflict, but refused to provide any more detailed 
commentary. 
  British official circles are closing their eyes to attempts 
of businessmen behind the scenes to arrange arms shipments to 
Azerbaijan and provide highly qualified military specialists to 
the national army. The British Foreign Office admits to the 
existence of plans to send mercenaries to Azerbaijan from Foggy 
Albion but vehemently denies participation in any dealing. As 
Mrs. MacFail, press secretary of the British mission in Moscow, 
stated to the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, the British 
Government may not hinder mercenaries from traveling to 
Azerbaijan insofar as freedom of movement is a high-priority 
right of British citizens. 
  Acting as intermediaries between the Azerbaijan military 
department and British "wild geese"--who are supposed to be in 
Azerbaijan in the near future and participate in the 
Armenia-Azerbaijan war on the side of Baku--are British and 
Turkish businessmen. A key role is being played by 68-year-old 
Lord Erskine of Rarrick, who resides in the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus. Lord Erskine is entered on diplomatic listings 
of the British Foreign Office as a first secretary. For his 
intermediary services Erskine receives many millions in 
honoraria from the Cyprus firm, Summit Ltd., registered in Great 
Britain. This consortium has already facilitated the acquisition 
of British and American arms by the Azerbaijan defense 
department in circumvention of the existing UN embargo on arms 
shipments into the zone of the Karabakh conflict. A certain 
Mustafa Mutlu is working together with Erskine, supporting 
contacts in Baku on the governmental level. 
  Our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned from 
trustworthy sources in Azerbaijan that that country's leadership 
is also supporting close contacts with American military 
circles. According to unconfirmed sources, the first party of 
American advisers is already on location in Azerbaijan. 
  The activity of Western businessmen striving to influence 
the 
outcome of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan can be 
explained by the fact that large-scale oil deposits have been 
discovered on the Caspian shelf along the coast of Azerbaijan. 
This is also attracting giants of the oil business to the 
region--British Petroleum, Amoco, Pennzoil, and others. The 
consortium which has been formed will soon begin the development 
of off-shore oil fields. Neither Azerbaijan nor its neighbor 
Russia has the appropriate technologies which would enable 
independent extraction of this oil, and the problem of 
transportation of crude oil has still not been resolved. One 
plan calls for the passage of a pipeline across Turkish 
territory to the Mediterranean coast. A new oil refinery is 
already being built in Izmir. Thus Azerbaijan could soon enter 
the world market with respect to the black gold. However, during 
the visit of Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller to Moscow in 
November 1993, the Russian side proposed its own version--laying 
the pipeline across Russian territory to the shores of the Black 
Sea. In rendering assistance to Azerbaijan, the West is making 
the outcome of the war independent of Russian military 
assistance to the sides in conflict. It is easy to predict what 
will follow: Baku will be inclined to make a decision that 
removes Russia from participation in the oil project of the 
century.

"The Former Ones, As Always, Are To Blame"] 
  [Text] A criminal file amounting to 30 volumes--such is the 
result of the investigation of the tragic events that occurred 
last summer when the former administration of Abulfaz Elchibey 
made an attempt at an armed attack on Colonel Suret Guseynov's 
formation. The government forces, using arms, wiped from the 
face of the earth a military barracks in the center of a densely 
populated city. There were victims, including peaceful residents 
who suffered. 
  And now the organizers and participants in this action will 
have to face the court. The former chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet of Azerbaijan Isa Gambarov and the ministers of defense 
and internal affairs have been charged under two articles: 
57-"prime," part 2, which indicates: "The use of armed forces 
against the people" and envisions prison sentences of from 10 to 
25 years, and also the death sentence. The second article is 
less "terrible"--168-"prime"--exceeding one's authority. It 
envisions up to seven years of isolation from the society. Also 
charged under this article are the former procurator general, 
the minister of national security, and his deputy. 
  This remains an open question so far: Were criminal charges 
brought against former president Abulfaz Elchibey and former 
prime minister Panakh Guseynov? But it is obvious that both of 
them are out of the reach of the investigatory organs. The 
former continues to live guarded by his supporters in his native 
village of Keleki, and the latter is on the run and, according 
to certain operational information, is outside the country.

"Commentary": "Eduard Shevardnadze: `The President of Russia Had 
the Courage...': Georgian Head of State and Parliament Chairman 
Comments for MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI on the Results of Boris 
Yeltsin's Visit"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin is probably the only Russian 
politician who has realized and taken upon himself full 
responsibility for a full-scale adjustment of Russian-Georgian 
relations. Even my democrat friends in Moscow still do not wish 
to understand the importance and necessity of the president of 
Russia's recent visit to Tbilisi. It is difficult for me to say 
this, but I must: Yegor Gaydar was in charge of the government 
during the period of the Georgian-Abkhazian war, while his 
cabinet provided immense financial and material aid to 
separatists. Boris Nikolayevich understands that normalization 
of our relations is in the interests of the preservation of 
political stability not only in Georgia but also in Russia 
itself. In the course of a one-on-one conversation we 
practically came to mutual understanding with respect to the 
resolution of common problems. Graphic evidence of this is the 
package of agreements that have been signed, including on 
freedom of trade, protection of borders, and many others--24 of 
them so far. More than 10 are still to be signed in the nearest 
future at the level of the prime ministers. In order to properly 
implement our agreements, a decision was made to create working 
commissions headed by Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and 
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. 
  Speaking at the Academy of Sciences in Tbilisi to the 
academic and creative intelligentsia, the president of Russia 
had the courage and fortitude to say that his country does not 
absolve itself of responsibility for what happened in Abkhazia. 
We discussed this problem too, of course. There are three 
options for settling it with the participation of the United 
Nations and the use of peacekeeping forces. We found mutual 
understanding with respect to practically all three options. 
  The first option envisages the participation of combined UN 
peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone. 
  The second also assumes the participation of this contingent 
with an analogous status, except that 80 percent of participants 
will be comprised of only Russian armed forces personnel. But in 
this case the point of contention is financing this process, 
which requires approximately $200 million, which, according to 
Butrus-Ghali, the United Nations currently does not have. There 
is also another option, which has been proposed by the UN 
secretary general--let Russia and Georgia come to an agreement 
among themselves regarding peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia. But 
in this case we face the same dilemma: Who will undertake the 
burden of financing? 
  Intensive consultations are currently underway in all 
directions. I know that the American government is looking for 
possible sources of financing. I think that in the nearest 
future we will arrive at a common denominator. In parallel, work 
is in progress on a model of political system for Abkhazia that 
will take into account protection of the rights of the peoples 
living there, which will be reflected in the new Georgian 
constitution. 
  One may ask: Why in the text of the final communique is the 
issue of ratification of this agreement linked to the problem of 
peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian problem? We have to 
understand that Russia also has its own difficulties in the 
North Caucasus. And this fact obligates both us and our neighbor 
to find a peaceful resolution to the existing confrontation. At 
the same time, Russia took it upon itself to provide 
organizational development for the Georgian national army. 
Before taking this step, I thought long and hard and consulted 
with many leaders of different countries. All were willing to 
provide aid only on the level of inspectors and consultants, but 
no one would undertake to provide aid in the form of armaments. 
Nobody except Russia is in a position today to provide tangible 
aid in this matter. 
  There are currently 30,000 soldiers and officers officially 
listed in our army on paper, but in reality you probably will 
not count even a few thousand. And nobody knows where the money 
allocated by the government goes. 
  Besides all these issues, many people want to know whether 
Georgia will join the ruble zone. I asked the president of 
Russia how he views this. His answer was straightforward: There 
is not much enthusiasm. It is an additional burden for Russia. 
Nevertheless, it was decided to set up a special commission, 
which will weigh all "pros" and "cons" and then will arrive at a 
concrete decision. 
  I consider it an important point of the visit that the 
president of Russia has accepted my "3 + 1" model for settling 
the Caucasus problem as a whole--creating a permanent 
consultative body with the participation of heads of 
Transcaucasus states and Russia. 
  Despite the opposition forces' skeptical attitude to this 
visit, the absolute majority of the population sees 
normalization of our relations as the only chance for Georgia to 
get out of the crisis. According to sociological surveys, 75 
percent actively support our course and only 10 percent feel 
negative about it.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Georgian Minister of Defense Tengiz </F>
Kitovani by Victor Mironov, under the rubric "Personalities;" 
place and date not given: "A Georgian of Pro-Russian 
Orientation"] 
  [Text] Tengiz Kitovani is truly a multifaceted man. A 
politician who at one time was acting prime minister; a military 
commander who until last May headed the Georgian Ministry of 
Defense; a man who has also dabbled in both sculpture and 
painting. In Tbilisi, though, he is known as A GEORGIAN OF 
PRO-RUSSIAN ORIENTATION. 
  In personal contact, Tengiz Kalistratovich is a very 
friendly, albeit reserved and laconic interlocutor. He saw me in 
a modest room in a small hotel located on a quiet Moscow 
street. 
  [Mironov] What capacity do you have now? 
  [Kitovani] I am merely a deputy to the Supreme Council of 
Georgia. 
  [Mironov] What is the purpose of your visit to Moscow? 
  [Kitovani] After the Abkhazian events I decided to get some 
rest. I went to Germany, and from there to Moscow--to see my 
friends, move away from political affairs, relax. 
  [Mironov] What is your appraisal of the recent meeting 
between Yeltsin and Shevardnadze? 
  [Kitovani] I have been waiting for this meeting for a long 
time. It should have taken place earlier--then perhaps we would 
not have had tragedy in Abkhazia and perhaps the entire country 
of Georgia as well. Two years have been wasted in this respect. 
A meeting should have taken place as soon as Shevardnadze 
came--or, to be precise, returned--to power in Georgia. Now it 
is a very belated step. With Georgia on its knees and out of the 
ruble zone, this rendezvous will at best result in a formal 
warming in Russian-Georgian relations. It is impossible to 
refute the fact that currently Tbilisi has suffered a complete 
defeat in the domestic political arena and at the world level. 
  [Mironov] Are there prospects for a final and mutually 
acceptable settlement in the Georgian-Abkhazian issue? 
  [Kitovani] Resolution of this problem depends to a very 
great 
extent on Russia and its policy regarding its southern neighbor. 
The search for a solution to the problem should have been 
conducted not in Geneva but in Moscow, within the framework of a 
trilateral dialogue. I am afraid that Abkhazia is irretrievably 
lost for Tbilisi. But this is only half the trouble--next is the 
problem of the Tskhinvali region. 
  [Mironov] Mr. Kitovani, what is your opinion of the Georgian 
leader's policy? 
  [Kitovani] In his two years of rule Shevardnadze has made a 
great many mistakes. However, the roots of the fault lie in the 
period when he was still a party boss. This is when active steps 
should have been taken toward resolving overdue problems 
regarding both the Abkhazian and the Ossetian people. That is, 
these issues have been awaiting settlement for a long time--way 
back under the communist regime headed by Shevardnadze. The 
current Georgian leader is called a reformer, although no 
reforms came about during his time. His policy remains the same 
as it was when the USSR existed. In principle, it has not 
changed. Shevardnadze, in particular, maintains that he has 
become a Christian and has forsaken communist ideas. In reality, 
however, he remains the same communist he has been for a long 
time. A man who for 60 years believed in communist ideals and 
principles cannot suddenly change his mentality. 
  [Mironov] Where do you see Georgia's political priorities at 
this difficult stage of its development? 
  [Kitovani] Historical experience shows that Georgia as a 
Christian state always gravitated to Byzantium. After the 
disintegration of the Byzantine empire the banner of Orthodox 
faith was picked up by Russia. I think that instead of looking 
toward West Europe and the United States, Shevardnadze should 
have oriented himself toward Russia and walked in step with its 
political course. I myself have always believed in this, and 
therefore in Georgia I am frequently accused of being a man of 
pro-Russian orientation. But it is not accidental that our 
ancestors believed it necessary to maintain friendly relations 
with the Russian people. This is the policy Georgia should have 
conducted--seeing Russia as the main ally and friend of Georgia. 
  [Mironov] Whom do you respect in the Georgian political 
establishment? 
  [Kitovani] I very much like my namesake Tengiz Sigua. In my 
opinion he is a very smart economist and politician. 
  [Mironov] And in Russia? 
  [Kitovani] In response to this I can only express my deepest 
regret that Yegor Gaydar has left the Russian political scene 
for now.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Knyazev: "Ajaria--An Island of </F>
Stability?"] 
  [Text] It is midday. The city's streets are half empty. The 
rarely encountered passers-by are not talkative. The shelves of 
the state stores are pristinely bare. Bread was delivered and a 
waiting line formed for it. But in the private commercial 
stores, on the contrary, everything is available and there are 
no waiting lines. For a Snickers chocolate bar for your child 
you shell out 30,000-35,000 coupons and there goes a third of 
your wages. One chicken costs 120,000 coupons. The salesmen 
break out into a smile at the sight of Russian rubles. 
  The dolphinarium, once famous throughout the Union, is 
empty. 
The inhabitants of the dolphinarium were transferred to less 
expensive premises "until times get better"--there is no money 
to pay the workers and there is no one to marvel at the 
dolphins--few people travel to Batumi, and the local residents 
prefer bread to spectacles. 
  There are few Russians left in Batumi. People's faces are 
stamped with gloom and doom. The government is praised for the 
fact that there is no war, but otherwise living is hard. They 
sell everything in order to eat. They staunchly tolerate 
accusations from citizens of the indigenous nationality that 
Russia is to blame for everything. The strong and healthy have 
left. The weak and sick have remained. 
  The Ajarian militia frequently go around out of uniform; 
they 
are replaced by automatic weapons as a way of showing that a 
person works for the power structures. Militiamen are paid a 
great deal, with private merchants footing the bill. The 
minister of internal affairs told them straightforwardly: If you 
do not want the youth to get involved in rackets and robbery but 
rather to preserve your peace, hand over the money. With these 
funds they purchase rations, weapons, and uniforms. 
  The border with Turkey is guarded. Russian border guards 
rule 
out the possibility of the illegal passage of armed formations 
across it. It is possible to bring a great deal from the other 
side of the cordons, but almost nothing is taken out. 
  Only two of Batumi's industrial enterprises are 
operating--the heating and electric power plant and the tea 
packaging factory. The equipment in the shops is ancient. 
  The chief of the 400,000 Ajarians, Aslan Abashidze, wants to 
reconcile Armenia with Azerbaijan and Abkhazia with the 
authorities in Georgia. The peacemaker is forced to sleep with 
his rations and stay alert--repeated attempts have been made on 
his life. In a KGB solitary confinement cell sits a person who 
was promised an immense sum for Abashidze's head in Tbilisi. But 
he himself had to make a confession since he considered "Mr. 
Aslan" to be a national hero. 
  Members of the Ajarian government travel throughout the 
world 
and they have a great deal about which the rank-and-file 
resident can only dream. But at the same time they work 15 hours 
a day. They say about themselves that their death sentence has 
been signed in the event that Abashidze leaves--both opponents 
in Batumi and ill-wishers in Tbilisi are thirsting for their 
blood--and too many of them want to live a free and easy life 
and have power in their hands. Simple people do not have time 
for that. City dwellers are being fed by their soft-hearted 
relatives from the villages. Ajarians dream about receiving 
their wages in Russian rubles and they were glad when Georgia 
entered the CIS. But certain of them still consider Russia to be 
to blame for all their problems. 
  For peace and tranquility, even if it is under the roar of 
automatic weapons, they thank Abashidze and Turkey, with which 
they have good relations. Customs officials of the Ajarians and 
their neighbors are living "in harmony." 
  There is almost no theft in Ajaria. Of the six motor 
vehicles 
driven away during the past year, four have been found. Is 
everything tranquil in Batumi?

<F P=106> [Two-part interview with economist Gavriil Popov by </F>
unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent under the rubric 
"Political Forecast"; held at the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY editorial 
office; date not given] 
<H5>  [No 7, Feb, pp 1, 3] </H5>
<H5>  [Part 1] </H5>
  [Text] 
<H5>  Where Will We Be in One Year? </H5>
  The well-known politician and economist Gavriil Popov 
recently visited ARGUMENTY I FAKTY. Today we are publishing the 
first part of a conversation with him. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] At this time everyone expects inflation 
to increase and is trying to salvage his small savings somehow. 
As an analyst, do you allow for the further siphoning in of 
currency and hyperinflation? 
  [Popov] There will be no hyperinflation. I believe the 
concept of manipulating paper currency to be brilliant. On one 
occasion, Keynes was asked to outline the essence of his 
teachings in an easy to understand manner, and he narrated: 
"Someone manufactured a counterfeit dollar and bought meat with 
it. The butcher paid a greengrocer for carrots with his dollar. 
The greengrocer paid a tailor. The tailor paid a watch 
repairman. It reached a physician, who did not intend to spend 
the dollar and took it to the bank. At the bank it turned out 
that the dollar was counterfeit. Subsequently, everyone began to 
return this dollar to one another, and it went back to the 
manufacturer of the counterfeit dollar. He gathered together all 
the participants, 15 people, and said: `It is true that the 
dollar is counterfeit. However, each one of you got 10 cents of 
absolutely real profit on this counterfeit dollar. In total, you 
got 150 cents of absolutely real profit. Let us cover the 
counterfeit dollar with 100 cents from these profits, and it 
will become real. As far as the 50 cents is concerned, split it 
among the 15 people and everybody will still have a profit.'" In 
essence, if the circulation of deceptive, inflationary paper 
money yields profits that exceed the volume of emission, nothing 
horrible happens. F. Roosevelt carried this out in reality in 
bringing the United States out of the Great Depression. 
Therefore, even if emission increases, nothing horrible happens 
as long as circulation together with profits exceed this 
emission. Danger looms when, in conventional terms, two rubles 
[R] are issued while only R1.5 in profits is generated; then 
currency depreciation begins. 
  If even a deceptive instrument energizes the entire economic 
circulation, it ultimately becomes something real. However, the 
state should still control the volume of inflation. To this end, 
we should have a cerebrating and wise government which is 
capable of taking risks, that is, completely different people. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] A reader wrote to us: Let us collect 
what 
foreign exchange remains and buy a wise government abroad. 
  [Popov] A wise government for Russia cannot be found abroad. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] To your mind, what is particularly 
dangerous for our government? 
  [Popov] The pattern of forming the government that has been 
accepted is the most dangerous. People allegedly representing 
parties have become members. They belong to the government, but 
they do not intend to be responsible for the actions of the 
government. Everyone pulls his own way, like the swan, the 
crawfish, and the pike in Krylov's fable. I believe that Chubays 
may be a member of the government, but not as a representative 
of Russia's Choice. The same is the case with Shokhin and 
everyone else. There may also be a second variant: the 
government consists of party representatives. Shokhin represents 
the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], Chubays--the 
Choice, but then it will be a coalition government rather than 
Chernomyrdin's government. In this case, all the factions in the 
Duma must be responsible for it. What is happening now? There is 
a government, to which these people belong, and in the Duma they 
intend to sign a collective document aimed against this 
government! This is the most horrible thing. This cannot be 
allowed to happen. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Still, if it were up to you, how would 
you form the government? 
  [Popov] The government will not be able to carry out any 
fundamental reform in the two years until new elections. This is 
why from the very beginning I would consider our current 
government to be transitional. It should prepare the 
premises for the next four years. It should primarily cleanse 
the country from the most scandalous consequences of Gaydar's, 
Fedorov's, and Chubays' shock therapy and mainly resolve the 
issue of taxation. Have you not filled out a declaration yet? 
This is what it indicates: for example, workers must pay a tax 
if an official bus takes them to work. A veteran who retires and 
receives a benefit is also taxed. They have not yet resolved to 
tax the voucher, but as soon as you buy shares with it, you are 
taxed. Even if you do not receive profits from stock, changes in 
the price of stock also constitute income and, therefore, are 
taxed. If they got you a newspaper or magazine subscription at 
work, this is income, and you pay tax. If a theater ticket was 
purchased for you or if there was a collective visit, you pay 
tax. One gets the impression that the impoverished officialdom 
must fleece the country to the hilt in order to raise the 
minister's salary by a factor of two. As far as people in the 
creative arts are concerned, this is an outrage pure and simple. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Gavriil Kharitonovich, you are a radical 
politician, but for some reason you did not support the shock 
therapy of Gaydar's reforms (although Gaydar believes that he 
has not yet reached the shock). Why? 
  [Popov] Shock therapy was in the interests of not only the 
West but also the Russian bureaucracy. It would never have been 
implemented here had this not been the case. If there is anyone 
who did not agonize over the shock, it is Yegor Timurovich. I 
think he was ready to go for the shock until the last Yeltsin 
voter. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] However, as steadfast reformers are 
trying to convince us, privatization has won, and a return to 
the old times is not possible. 
  [Popov] Privatization as such does not resolve the main 
issue. Private property has been present in the history of 
humanity for 2,000 years. However, it became the driving force 
of progress only in the environment of free 
competition which was created by capitalism. Under 
feudalism there was the feudal lord, who was also the landowner. 
However, he did not have competition, and there was no incentive 
to improve the state of affairs. Privatization should proceed to 
the extent to which a competitive situation is created 
thereafter. If you have one plant in the entire country, the 
situation will not improve but will rather become more dangerous 
because we proclaim it to be private. After all, when a 
state-appointed director is ensconced, he is dependent on the 
state; he has no great interest in maneuvering. Imagine now that 
we have a private owner here. For example, can a state-appointed 
director allocate R5 million for a bribe? No, he has to report. 
The private owner may do so freely if this holds the promise of 
R15 million in profit later. Monopolies with private owners are 
a horrible thing. Please recall that antitrust laws have been 
passed in the United States, whereas we left everything to its 
own devices. We should abandon a monopolized structure. This 
means very large expenditures. Enterprises must be converted 
into joint-stock companies so that employees will share in the 
profits and be better motivated. However, enterprises may not be 
made private. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] If we look a little ahead, how do you 
see 
our society precisely a year from now? 
  [Popov] There is a specific scenario. First: the president 
makes a decision, but the Duma does not poll 50 percent of the 
vote for it. Therefore, the decision is rejected. Or the Duma 
makes a decision, the president fails to sign it, the proposal 
is returned to the Duma and fails to poll two-thirds of the 
vote--likewise, the decision is not passed. This adversarial 
scenario must end in the dissolution of the Duma. Since by that 
time the Duma will have been working for a year, the president 
will have the right to do this (as early as January). A second 
version: the Duma, the president, and the government begin to 
operate making an effort not to get involved in conflicts among 
themselves. I do not think that this is going to be very 
effective because all structures feel uncertain. The president 
and the Duma know that elections are coming in one and a half 
years, and the government knows that a new president will need a 
new Duma. Therefore, their entire activities will amount to a 
game of "short-term gains." That is, they will implement a set 
of measures so that their effect will be felt within three to 
seven months. In this case, this may be used in the preelection 
struggle. They likewise cannot do anything radically bad in this 
mode because it will also be used in the preelection struggle. 
From the point of view of tranquility, this is a normal 
scenario. From the point of view of reforms, this means slowing 
down the pace. 
  The third scenario: all of them will adhere to the same 
strategy, but do work to be built on in the future. I would 
consider this scenario to be the best. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Will Yeltsin still be president a year 
from now? 
  [Popov] Of course. After all, he wants to be reelected yet 
again. If we do not proceed from that, I cannot explain his 
actions otherwise.

<H5>  [Part 2] </H5>
  [Text] 
<H5>  The People Do not Want Any Shooting </H5>
  The motion picture "Repentance" has a scene in which an 
old woman asks whether this road leads to the temple, and she is 
told: "No, this is Varlam Street, it cannot lead to the 
temple." 
  The December elections showed that those who voted rejected 
the version of reforms that was proclaimed following August 
1991. Although until then the "top" had maintained that the 
chosen model was the right one and that the people supported it. 
But it became clear in a matter of hours here that the country 
was opposed. To formulate it concisely, this was the road of the 
post-August Boris Nikolayevich which also "did not lead to the 
temple," just as that of Mikhail Sergeyevich had not. Is this a 
tragedy or a success? A success, I believe. Had we dragged out 
this process, the next stage of the conflict would have been 
very grim. 
  In actual fact, whose election program, pray, contained 
shock 
therapy? It was in no one's. Whose program contained the 
abolition of the USSR? No one's. Whose program contained the 
fact that governors, mayors, and so forth, would be appointed 
from the top? Again, no one had this. So that after August 1991 
an entirely different concept of reforms, different from that 
which had gained approval at the time of the presidential ballot 
in June 1991, was put forward "on the quiet." 
<H5>  Ideas </H5>
  What ideas were, in fact, adopted after August? The 
first idea was that Russia would pursue reforms 
faster and better than the Soviet Union and that the Soviet 
Union was a burden. We are feeding them all, they are like 
stones around our neck. 
  Second idea. The West will give us big money so 
that we might pursue the reforms. It was generally believed that 
the West was simply dreaming of immediately rearing a new 
competitor for itself. 
  The third idea was that it was possible to get by 
with the current mechanism of power, having updated it somewhat. 
  The fourth idea: Instead of the transition to a 
multiparty system, the idea of depoliticization was advanced. 
Not only the CPSU but also all political organizations at 
enterprises and in the army and the law enforcement authorities 
were banned. The bureaucracy undertook to govern itself. 
  And, finally, the fifth idea: The national 
structures, which Russia had inherited from socialism, needed to 
adopt and conclude a federal treaty, in which there would be no 
Russia but dozens of krays and oblasts. 
  But practice has shown that since the liquidation of the 
USSR 
the republics have been warring with one another and that wars 
are being fought within republics among individual 
nationalities. Thus the premise that by removing the USSR we 
would be removing a delayed-action mine was not justified. 
Economically either. 
  There are things that simply cannot be valued in terms of 
money. One of man's basic instincts is self-preservation. People 
feel surer and more composed in a big state. And this 
compensates for both undernourishment and other inconveniences. 
  Why in April had the pro-president forces not yet lost, but 
did so in December? First, because use was not made of the 
results of the referendum. Second, because the people saw that 
they were being governed by those who might shoot. And they 
categorically have no desire for any shooting. 
<H5>  Mistakes </H5>
  Our movement, the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, 
lost tactically on several counts. We believed that some bloc 
could be formed. I did not think that the personal interests of, 
let us say, Yavlinskiy, would be above common interests. We 
hoped to create a bloc with part of Volskiy's Civic Union also. 
There was one condition: I implored them to detach themselves 
from Rutskoy, and this meant detaching themselves from 
Lipitskiy. But they could not bring themselves to do so. We had, 
therefore, to act alone, and this was a futile undertaking. But 
I decided that it was better to lose but declare our 
independence than to do as the Republican Party did: become 
dissolved among the blocs. 
  But all the tactical mistakes in aggregate do not cover up 
the main mistake--strategic. Yes, after August 1991 and the 
choice of new policy I realized that the electorate would run 
from the government fronts. That we needed to create the RDDR 
[Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms] as a defensive line, 
which would halt all these fugitives and attract them to itself. 
I quit the office of mayor--this was all correct. But I made a 
mistake. First, we erected this defensive line too close. 
The people were running past, bypassing not only us but 
Volskiy and Travkin and even the Russian Communist Party, and 
running up to Zhirinovskiy. Second, I had assumed that 
there would be both flight and confrontation at the presidential 
elections. I was thrown off in my calculations by the April 
referendum, and I underestimated the scale of the impact of 
October on people's minds. I believed that the people would 
still show patience--this purely Russian trait. Had we allowed 
for the fact that there would be a confrontation with the 
government model of reforms in December even, the RDDR would 
have gone to the elections aggressively and on the offensive. We 
proceeded, however, from the idea that the people would vote for 
the presidential-government party and that we would remain, as 
before, the opposition. But we should here, apparently, have 
emphasized all along the line not opposition but confrontation. 
That is, we should have played an entirely different game. 
<H5>  Shock Therapy </H5>
  It meant that we would start to live according to the plan 
of 
transformations formulated for us in the West. The West itself, 
however, has not employed this plan, no developed countries have 
ever resorted to it. It is what they have recommended for 
export, to backward countries. We will admit you to our table 
only as second-rate partners. But account was not taken of the 
opinion of our people, who could put up with and agree to a 
great deal more in order to remain among the leaders. This is a 
particular historical feature of theirs. 
  Shock therapy did not come off for the following reason 
also. 
Power after August was a bloc of two bureaucracies: young 
and old. At the first stage the tone was set by the young 
bureaucracy. What suited the old bureaucracy in the shock 
therapy, on the other hand, was the fact that property would be 
shared out under the control of the apparatus. But when the 
speed of the reforms increased, it transpired that the "old men" 
were still not prepared for it. They (as distinct from the young 
ones) are realists and had a presentiment that were they to 
openly purchase a plant, the workers would kick them out of this 
plant. They understood that, before buying the plant, they 
needed to control the militia and the public prosecutor's office 
and to have their own judges. But there was as yet none of this. 
They were opposed, therefore, to the pace that had been imposed 
by the shock therapy. Nor did the ideology of shock therapy rule 
out the fact that the purchasers would be foreigners, who, with 
the current value of the dollar and the ruble, would buy up many 
plants here. This did not suit the old bureaucracy either. 
  And the final--social--aspect. Shock therapy proceeded from 
the idea that the people should themselves pay in full for all 
these problems of transition to the market. It was a plan 
whereby a large part of the people would pay for the whole of 
the past in full while the other part would at this time obtain 
the privileges. 
<H5>  Power </H5>
  I consider the presence of stable power to be the most 
important thing for the reforms. No one will invest money and no 
one will work until stable prospects appear. 
  How was the stability of power in Germany and Japan secured? 
Stability was secured by two conditions: there was in both 
places the American Army. There were elections, but such that 
Adenauer was in power in the FRG for 20 years, and in Japan the 
Liberal Democratic Party has governed for 40 years. Things could 
calmly be seen through to a conclusion. In South Korea or Chile 
stability was embodied by a military dictatorship. In Spain, by 
a constitutional monarchy. 
  None of these options would do for us. Military dictatorship 
in a multinational state is an impracticable thing. We had an 
opportunity to take the Chinese path, in the event of the CPSU 
finding within itself the powers to reorganize. It would have 
been a guarantor of stability. But we did not take this path. 
American Army options would do even less. In my opinion, 
we are left with just one option: seeking a version of a 
coalition of political forces. This would be a center agreement. 
And this coalition should agree within itself on the main lines 
of the transitional period. 
  I believe that two categories of people should be a part of 
the government. Those who are capable of creating a 
long-term program (if Gaydar has been removed, and he was a 
person of conceptual thinking, Yavlinskiy, who can create 
long-term programs, needs to be brought in, consequently). 
And those who can pull the cart. 
  I believe that the president needs to put some distance 
between himself and the government. We have too big a country, 
we cannot permit such a concentration of power--all for the 
president. He should appoint the prime minister. And that is 
all. He should not be involved with either ministers or 
programs. He should remain aloof and be a guarantor of the 
reforms. And replace in good time a government that has realized 
part of the set of problems by another that could go further and 
realize the next stage.

<F P=106> [Interview with B. Fedorov, deputy of the State Duma and </F>
chief of the subcommittee for the credit and monetary policy of 
the Central Bank of Russia, by N. Zhelnorova, under the rubric 
"After the Scandal"; place and date not given: "Who Stole Our 
Wages?"] 
  [Text] Former Minister of Finance of Russia B. 
Fedorov answered questions put by N. Zhelnorova. Currently, B. 
Fedorov is a deputy of the State Duma and chief of the 
subcommittee for the credit and monetary policy of the Central 
Bank of Russia. 
  [Zhelnorova] Boris Grigoryevich, many people cannot stand 
the 
sight of you because you deliberately delayed the payment of 
wages in order to ensure an "artificial" reduction in inflation. 
  [Fedorov] This is a lie, an attempt to cover up their 
inability to manage the economy. The government made decisions 
to spend funds that were not envisioned in the budget and, 
consequently, were illegal. Most decisions were made contrary to 
the Ministry of Finance. 
  [Zhelnorova] Why was it happening? 
  [Fedorov] Because our bosses on high believed that it was 
enough to write on a piece of paper "the Ministry of Finance 
shall procure" in order for it to definitely "procure" the 
funds. In no country can an official spend even $100 as he sees 
fit. Everybody knows from his everyday life that he must live 
within his means. If you have 100 rubles [R] in your wallet, you 
may spend more only if you obtain credit. Meanwhile, trillions 
of rubles are spent in our country without detailed 
calculations. The government believes that it may spend as much 
as it wants, and since nobody will extend normal credit to it, 
it will simply print more money. However, plucking more money 
out of thin air does not mean that more goods have appeared. If 
A. Zaveryukha's wife begins to spend money based, in a way, on 
twice the amount of his salary, he will soon remind her that he 
has only one salary, after all. However, he acts in the exact 
opposite way as far as the country is concerned. 
  We pursued our financial policy in 1993 based on the target 
of credit outlays that had been approved by the government. 
However, it was also exceeded by a great deal. Enormous 
unexpected expenditures arose--for the elections and the 
referendum, repairing the White House, and so on. 
  [Zhelnorova] You have come down hard on your opponents (or 
adversaries) because they want to extend credit to the agrarian 
sector. However, it was indeed not fair: to promise the peasants 
to pay for grain, and later not to pay, just like petty 
swindlers. 
  [Fedorov] Believe me, nowhere in the world does the state 
procure grain! Our rural "barons" first pushed through an 
enormous state order for grain without regard for the financial 
potential of the state (in July 1993, under pressure from 
Zaveryukha and Starodubtsev, our prime minister approved the 
procurement price for grain at the world level, although there 
was no money). Later, the "barons" began to demand that the 
"debts" be paid back. Hence the busting of the budget and the 
ridiculous position of both the prime minister and the minister 
of finance. However, the "agricultural barons" are now demanding 
state orders for 1994 once again! Wages in sectors financed from 
the budget are indexed similarly. Indexation announcements are 
always backdated, although it is patently clear that there is no 
money and a delay of one to three months is a virtual certainty. 
So, a pay rate agreement with the coal miners has just been 
signed. The absurdity of such agreements has been discussed many 
times. Wages are not paid; subsidies are illegally spent for 
purposes other than those envisioned. To cover up mismanagement, 
the bosses are now forced to print additional money, thus 
stimulating inflation. Ultimately we will pay for such 
irresponsibility out of our own pockets. Financial discipline, 
which means living within our means, as well as responsibility 
and control--this is the reform we need more than anything. 
  [Zhelnorova] Do you sympathize with the prime minister, who 
has given up a strong minister of finance? 
  [Fedorov] Chernomyrdin's current task is to play into the 
hands of the Agrarians and the Communists, to squeeze 
"youngsters" out of the government, and to begin doing 
everything his way. However, he does not understand that the 
economy cannot be made to work by administrative methods. 
Indeed, I agree that Chernomyrdin and his new team are good 
managers, but within the framework of a large enterprise. But 
Russia is not a Gazprom. In this instance, one must know about 
and understand the connection between the exchange rate, 
inflation, and the growth of production. 
  [Zhelnorova] Some people from your team maintain that 
everything in Russia will explode three months from now. 
  [Fedorov] I think it will not be three months but rather 
six. 
There are economic laws that are impossible to circumvent. 
  However, I do not intend to foretell a collapse; this is 
pointless, all the more so because we do not yet know what kind 
of policy there will be. For now I do not consider myself in 
opposition to the government. It is another matter to have 
apprehensions (90 percent) about the government opting for 
another path which is worse for Russia. 
  Of course, if we analyze the composition of the government, 
there are few genuine reformers there, except for Chubays (and 
then it is not clear how long he will hold on). Shokhin is a 
turncoat, a person who likes sitting down with the prime 
minister for hours. He will make it to the position of minister 
of defense. I brought in Dubinin, who has now been appointed 
acting minister of finance. However, I am not sure whether he 
can stand up to the wave of pressure being brought to bear on 
him. (My uniqueness was found in the fact that I could tell 
anyone to "get lost," while some people, such as Lobov, could 
not get through to me on the phone at all. I was not inclined to 
allow the compromises which Gaydar continuously allowed to 
occur.) 
  [Zhelnorova] Once again, your departure was associated with 
a 
scandal. How did it happen--viewing the event from the inside? 
  [Fedorov] When Chernomyrdin saw through our subterfuge and 
ruses associated with conducting financial stabilization (the 
Ministry of Finance alone fought everybody), I understood that 
the time for compromises was over, that is, they would cross the 
critical line after which you lose respect for yourself. This is 
why I decided to quit. I do not want to be a commander without 
an army. Having become accustomed to my quite extensive role in 
the financial policy pursued, I could not allow someone to order 
finances about while Fedorov was alive (as minister). 
  [Zhelnorova] What would you advise the president to do? What 
are your "three cards?" 
  [Fedorov] First: Always adhere to the same course. Second: 
Put together a homogeneous government. Third: Think about 
succession of power.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with Boris Fedorov, former deputy </F>
prime minister and minister of finance of the Russian 
Federation, recorded by Grigoriy Tsitrinyak under the rubric 
"Club 206," at the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial office; date 
not given: "Boris Fedorov: `No More Programs Are Needed--Ever!'"] 
  [Text] A. Udaltsov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editor in 
chief. Boris Grigoryevich, my first question is associated 
with the current array of political forces. Well, it is 
understandable that your opponents criticize you. However, here 
is Kozyrev stating that to him, Chernomyrdin is a reformer just 
like Gaydar, Popov stating that Gaydar's course was too 
pro-Western, Luzhkov stating that the last two "years of Gaydar" 
were an economic failure, Shokhin.... 
  B. Fedorov. There already is complete clarity as 
far as he is concerned.... 
  A. Udaltsov. So, what is happening? 
<H5>  "Red Economic Managers" </H5>
  B. Fedorov. Everything is far from unambiguous. 
They talk about the "Gaydar government." However, Gaydar was not 
a member of the government between 12 December 1992 and 16 
September 1993. After 16 September he did not actually take any 
action. It is just that for some reason everybody got the 
impression that he was prime minister all that time, and that 
Chernomyrdin in a way had no part of it. What policy did the 
government pursue, and what is reform? 
  So, if you back 10 ministers against the wall somewhere and 
ask them to name at least five points which are characteristic 
of the reforms, I assure you that some might not answer at all, 
while others will merely repeat "reform! reform! reform!" This 
is why I would answer this way: Many of the people who were and 
still are members of the government had nothing to do with 
either the reforms or the policy pursued. 
  Aleksandr Nikolayevich Shokhin is the most vivid case in 
point. He was a member of Silayev's government in its time, and 
later successively deputy chairman for social issues, deputy 
chairman for foreign economic relations, and now minister of the 
economy; he is fighting to have the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations also subordinated to him. The Federal Service on 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control or the Ministry of 
Education may be next up, and I would not be surprised because 
he has no clear-cut course, to say nothing about reformism. 
  I have known Kozyrev for quite a long time: I came to the 
Silayev government just before him. My impression is: He 
believes that foreign policy can be separated from domestic 
policy. I am absolutely convinced that the opposite is true. If 
a turnaround begins in the country, considerable changes will 
occur in foreign policy, too. Of course, it is possible that he 
will turn out to be so flexible as to consider any change normal. 
  There are a great number of purely functional specialists in 
the government--on transportation, etc. Naturally, they also 
never had anything to do with the reforms. When Gaydar came in 
1991 he began, having secured the support of the president, to 
follow, essentially alone, a certain course which turned out to 
be short-lived because in the middle of 1992 it became different. 
  I had only one task: A hard ruble was needed, and there was 
no escaping that fact. Financial discipline was needed. Prices 
had to be free, and the exchange rate had to be determined by 
demand and supply on the market. One did not have to be a 
prominent economist in that instance. The main point was to 
pursue a certain policy consistently. As long as Chernomyrdin 
was in a state of bewilderment over what economic policy in a 
market economy is, this was successful. 
  However, in the summer of 1993 Gerashchenko pushed through 
monetary reform. He did it professionally: He put us off guard 
by statements that the currency would be exchanged until the end 
of the year, I went away on leave, and he struck a blow. It then 
became clear that adherence to reforms proclaimed by 
Chernomyrdin was a disguise, that he never considered broadly 
interpreted reforms his own. 
  At present, "Red economic managers" play the leading role in 
the government; the prime minister himself has said today that 
he is proud of being a "Red director." The problem is that while 
they are experienced politicians, they do not know about the 
economy. To them, it is a different life. They do not understand 
it. 
  I assure you that had it not been for the September events, 
the things that happened this January might have happened in 
September and October, because even then plans existed to 
squeeze certain people out of the government, to reduce their 
status, and to regroup forces. Individuals such as Shakhray and 
Shokhin, all their desire to display loyalty to the prime 
minister notwithstanding, will always remain outsiders in the 
government no matter what: they are not "Red directors." 
Shokhin, with his cozy thick glasses, will forever give the 
impression of an intellectual who is meddling in someone else's 
business. There will be more verbal glitter. 
  So, I was in Davos in conjunction with the prime minister, 
who swore everywhere that he would combat inflation. However, 
given that on 20 January he said that his target for the end of 
the year was 8-9 percent, and on 25 January that the target 
already was 15-18 percent, the common man is compelled to ask: 
When did he speak the truth? And what kind of policy is being 
pursued? 
  Look at just one problem--the savings of the population; not 
one of the "Red economic managers" discusses it at all. 
Meanwhile, this is the most important indicator of the health of 
a country. A state is doomed if the population has nothing and 
cannot save up. If there are savings that grow in real terms, 
the country has a future because there is a foundation for 
investment, for the extension of long-term credit, and for the 
expansion of production. In our country savings had been 
declining for two years, but began to grow in real terms in 
November and December. To be sure, the trend has now changed. 
  So that I finish my soliloquy, after all: At present, 
everyone is tired of everything. How many times can we 
restructure? How many times can promises be made? Many people 
have begun to talk about unity and accord: Let us come to an 
agreement, they say, and it will be better for all. Or let us 
unite with Belarus--and prosperity will come about right away.... 
  O. Moroz, member of the LITERATURNAYA GAZETA editorial 
board. For Belarus, that is.... 
  B. Fedorov. Maybe for Belarus. The events that 
happened in January do not allow even the relative success that 
has been achieved to be built on. In January the rate of 
inflation was not supposed to exceed 15 percent, whereas it was 
at 22 percent. This is just the beginning: Judging by the latest 
reports from the government, the Ukrainian scenario is drawing 
ever closer to us. Another two or three unifications of monetary 
systems--with Georgia, Tajikistan.... I think that Kazakhstan 
and Uzbekistan will not be far behind--everyone wants to get at 
least something.... 
<H5>  Mr. Gerashchenko's Scalp </H5>
  Yu. Kulikov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA deputy editor in 
chief. In the State Duma you were elected chairman of the 
subcommittee that will oversee credit and monetary policy. You 
will get to draw a lot of Gerashchenko's blood.... 
  B. Fedorov. You see, I am a fatalist in the sense 
that I believe the progress of history cannot be stopped, and 
Mr. Gerashchenko's scalp will one day hang on the wall and adorn 
my house. Carthage must be destroyed. There is no doubt that he 
is a talented man. He is neither a central banker, because he 
does not understand what he is supposed to do, nor an economist, 
because he does not know elementary things about monetary 
circulation in a market economy. He is a man who managed to live 
abroad for 15 years and failed to understand how the economy 
works there. Incidentally, he did not manage to learn the 
language properly, either. However, he is talented in terms of 
his bureaucratic conditioning; he has already survived several 
regimes, and he always has a paper with the right endorsement. 
  I think that my position will be very simple: We will begin 
to hold hearings in a fundamentally different way from that of 
the former Supreme Soviet, conventionally speaking, the way they 
do in England. We will word 300 or 500 questions and demand 
answers in writing. Thereafter officials from the Central Bank 
will answer questions, this time before the subcommittee--just 
as in the U.S. Congress, very quietly and amicably. After all, 
we are a legislative organ, and we cannot determine the policy 
of the executive authorities. However, we have a duty to know 
what goes on in the Central Bank. 
  Naturally, I am extremely interested in the balance sheet. 
The bank was actually created in December 1990, but no one has 
seen the results so far. In the existing report there are a few 
lines about the balance sheet at the very end, on one page. 
However, when an international auditor writes in his statement 
that he does not understand many things about the Central Bank, 
and that he does not assume responsibility for saying that 
everything in the bank is correct, these are very sophisticated 
words to the effect that a lot is incorrect there. 
  A. Udaltsov. Now that we have you here, could you 
sketch the "banking landscape" for us and name the most 
respectable banks? 
  G. Tsitrinyak, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator. 
Such advertisement is expensive.... 
  A. Udaltsov. Those with integrity will pay later. 
(Laughter). 
  B. Fedorov. In terms of the level of development, 
the banking system is ahead of many economic sectors. Previously 
it did not exist, there was a niche. People came there who for 
the most part had not been bankers in their earlier lives. 
Gusinskiy of the Most was a director; Khodorkovskiy of the 
Menatep was a chemist; Petya Korotkov, with the Russian National 
Bank, worked with us at the DENGI I KREDIT magazine; I remember 
taking an article to him. Certain others.... People came in who 
did not have any dogmas and managed to get the system going 
astoundingly fast: At present Russia already has about 2,000 
banks with 4,000 branches. 
  I think that the banks will begin to play a quite 
conspicuous 
role. All of them, especially the large banks, take an interest 
in politics. All of them already have something to lose if we 
recall that some balance sheets already exceed $100 million, and 
the opening of each branch, for example in Moscow, costs $1 
million at minimum. 
  As I see it, there are not that many truly powerful banks 
that one can work with--between 30 and 50. During the past year 
the Ministry of Finance worked with 15-20 banks, and among them 
were the Most, Stolichnyy, Inkombank, and Menatep. There were 
also smaller banks--the Tveruniversalbank, the Russian National 
Bank, and a number of banks such as the Tokobank. These banks, 
whether one likes them or not, are quite reliable; they will not 
disappear soon. I also like the Tekhnobank headed by Garegin 
Tosunyan very much; it impresses me because it tries to think 
about the entire country instead of being wrapped up solely in 
its own problems. 
  Yu. Kulikov. As you see it, why are bankers being 
killed? 
  B. Fedorov. Not just bankers--if you have a lot of 
money and this becomes common knowledge.... However, there is 
one nuance in this instance: There are quite a few people in the 
banking community who are entangled in affairs that are hard to 
call legitimate. 
  O. Moroz. You are seconding the dangerous point of 
view of the Ministry of Internal Affairs--that only those 
involved in criminal pursuits are being killed, they say. 
  B. Fedorov. No, I am not seconding it. I merely 
said that this is also a fact. A large enough number of banks 
which were tied to groups of a particular kind have recently 
closed--this is also a fact. It is another matter that the law 
enforcement organs operate so inefficiently.... Here is an 
example: Everybody agrees that corruption is on the rise. 
However, who has been put behind bars in the last three years? 
Name them--it is just that I am interested to know.... Or taxes: 
It is clear that the revenue is small, that profits are being 
concealed. I called in the tax police and asked them when we 
would hold at least a few well-known individuals accountable.... 
  S. Oganyan, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator. Did 
you name names? 
  B. Fedorov. I hinted. (Laughter). So 
what? Nothing happened. 
<H5>  An Interesting Detail </H5>
  G. Tsitrinyak. Effective 1 January, the 
circulation of foreign exchange in parallel with the ruble was 
discontinued. At the former foreign exchange stores they now put 
prices on the merchandise in dollars, take payment in rubles, 
and set their own exchange rates. Here is an official summary 
report for 7 February from the newspaper SEGODNYA: The 
ruble-dollar exchange rate at the "Shop No. 1" store--1,880, and 
at the "NBM"--1,555. For reference: On the same day the exchange 
rate of 1,560 rubles [R] to the dollar was fixed at the trading 
session on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange. What is all 
this about? Did they fail to envision that the exchange rate at 
foreign exchange stores may differ from the rate at the trading 
session by more than a few percentage points? Did they 
officially authorize robbery? 
  B. Fedorov. As early as 1991 I told Gaydar's guys 
that elementary rules should have been introduced at first when 
currency exchange bureaus opened in a country lacking culture in 
certain operations, in a country that had monopolies. Say, the 
selling rate of foreign exchange in exchange bureaus or shops 
should not have exceeded that on the exchange by more than 5 
percent. We proposed this, but it was not accepted. However, the 
Central Bank may introduce this within three seconds without a 
problem. 
  G. Tsitrinyak. Then why has the Central Bank not 
introduced it so far? After all, shoes can wait, but when one 
needs drugs.... 
  B. Fedorov. I would undertake to put this question 
to Gerashchenko. 
  O. Moroz. What do you think about the nonpayments 
crisis, and what way out do you see? 
  B. Fedorov. One should not promise more than one 
has. In this instance, no knowledge of monetarism is required. 
The unpaid sums are a myth which is associated with one point: 
If the president and the prime minister of a state consider it 
possible to spend as much as they want and for whatever purposes 
they want, apart from the approved budget and its items of 
expenditure, the budget will certainly be busted. 
  I even tried to explain to the government: "If you go 
shopping you cannot spend more than you have in your wallet...." 
Meanwhile, the state considers it possible to live any which 
way. Agrarian lobbyists forced through the grain price, plus 
repairs to the White House, plus 250 billion for the elections, 
and so on, and so forth. The Ministry of Finance had not built 
all of that into the budget. Naturally, there was no spare 
money; it was taken away from someone. 
  Besides, to a considerable degree, legislation made it 
possible not to pay; there was no mechanism for bankruptcy, nor 
were there bankruptcies. Not a single director was relieved. 
  In general, the lack of an industrial policy was the 
greatest 
mistake of the year 1993, just as it is now. There were many 
industrialists in the government, but there was no industrial 
policy because everybody wanted to work on finance and ask for 
subsidies. In essence, those who are received by the president 
and the prime minister are the directors of the largest bankrupt 
enterprises: Peskov from the Rosselmash or Gulko from the 
Metrovagonmash. 
  Here is an episode: The director of a bankrupt enterprise 
came in and narrated publicly that he had consulted with the 
president in the company of those as bankrupt as he was, and 
communicated to me confidentially: "In general, we will have you 
removed, but we have not found another candidate yet. And we 
will demote Chubays...." For some reason they do not consult 
with the Uralmash--private capital has come along there. 
  O. Moroz. Therefore, do you think that the clamor 
in the press on account of nonpayments is not commensurate with 
the situation? 
  B. Fedorov. Of course. To a considerable degree 
the clamor is a continuation of corporate behavior and lobbying 
efforts. 
  D. Molchanov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator. 
Some time ago Gerashchenko's deputy Solovov stated that the 
Central Bank issued R11 billion in cash to the government on the 
night of 3 October. What money was it and where did it go? 
  B. Fedorov. They did not issue anything to us. 
Chernomyrdin had a question: Everything could have dragged 
out--fighting was underway, banks were closed; people had to be 
fed, but nobody gave anything for free. It would have been good 
for the government to have a certain reserve of, specifically, 
cash. It turned out that the government and the Ministry of 
Finance did not have a thing. Than we decided to officially 
withdraw from our account--that of the Ministry of Finance at 
the Central Bank--a certain amount of cash. Of course, that 
night nobody was there at the Central Bank. Commercial banks in 
which we had accounts helped: After a single telephone call they 
brought 10 billion. We held this money until the end of 
December, when I decided thus: Why would it sit here and bear no 
interest--and we returned it. 
  I. Rishina, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA department 
editor. Today's MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI carries an interview 
with Shakhray, and these words of his are made into the 
headline: "...As far as the prospects for Gaydar and Fedorov, I 
think that they are gone from the government for a long time, 
most likely for good...." What does he mean? That you are gone, 
and that the era of Shatalin plus Abalkin, who it seemed to me 
could have never united, has come? 
  B. Fedorov. Serezha Shakhray was a good guy.... 
Personally, I am truly pained by the strange behavior of Mr. 
Shakhray, whom I always considered to be one of the sober-minded 
individuals. His alliances with certain people, his bowing down 
to the policy against which he had come out.... My impression is 
that he has lost his bearings, and is now grasping this fact 
with difficulty. 
  Those who have seen the academicians' program know that it 
does not have a single specific proposal. I have not yet read 
Glazyev's program--the hearings are tomorrow. I have just met 
the author and said: "Greetings, ideological enemy!" 
(Laughter). 
  L. Velikanova, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA commentator. 
Is there hope that the current situation may end in some 
civilized way, or does a civil war or a military coup await us, 
as many people predict? 
  B. Fedorov. I do not believe in a military coup. 
However, it is unavoidable that the situation will worsen. I 
think that yet another experiment will be conducted--reform "Red 
economic manager"-style. Many programs will appear, although no 
more programs are needed--ever! After all, the entire program 
may fit on three pages: What are your priorities? What tasks do 
you set with regard to savings, the exchange rate, the interest 
rate, the growth of the money supply, and labor productivity? 
With regard to the real income of the population and the 
consumption of foodstuffs? That is all! I do not need anything 
else: We will proceed from this in solving the problems of 
unemployment and other problems. 
  Yu. Solomonov, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA deputy editor in 
chief. I do not believe that Gerashchenko's scalp can be 
your final objective. In this case, in the name of what do you 
work? 
  B. Fedorov. I want major changes in the economy to 
occur in my country. If only we had overcome inflation and begun 
to develop quietly.... I think that after everything had been 
set right it would no longer have been interesting for me, and I 
would have left for an investment bank--to make money. 
  O. Moroz. At some point will you raise the issue 
of confidence in our glorious government in the Duma after all? 
  B. Fedorov. There should be weighty grounds for 
this, for example, the psychological barrier when inflation 
reaches 30 percent. You will see that the attitude in society 
will change then. 
  A. Udaltsov. Should we perhaps finish on this 
note? Thank you for making it here, to us. It is even more 
interesting for you to come "out of office," because "in office" 
you need to restrain yourself somewhat on occasion. 
  B. Fedorov. Of course, in that case I would have 
gone easier on certain names. (Laughter). However, 
here is yet another interesting detail in conclusion. I quit the 
State Bank, and the chairman was removed. I quit the Central 
Committee--the secretary for economics was removed. I quit the 
Silayev government--Silayev was removed one year later. I quit 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development--Jacques 
Attali was removed. I have now quit the government.... 
(Laughter).

and Prognosis": "With An Eye to the Future"]

<H5>  The Situation in the Economy </H5>
  An analysis of the economic situation in Russia will produce 
few consoling results so far. The year 1993 really was not one 
of stabilization. 
  There are many reasons for this. The absence of a broad 
segment of property owners in the country had its effect. 
Another factor was the extremely low level of enterprise 
investment activity caused by the high inflation. Producers 
found it impossible to recover from the collapse of trade with 
the CIS countries. 
  As a result, the production of products of industry and 
agriculture in 1993 amounted to only 84 percent and 94 percent 
of the preceding year's, respectively. The volume of cargo 
shipments dropped by almost 30 percent. Consumer prices rose 
more than 10-fold and retail commodity turnover decreased by 6 
percent. 
  Still, these indicators are better than the ones for 1992. 
In 
terms of the absolute majority of parameters the recession is 
slowing, and the rates of inflation have decreased by more than 
half. Prognosticatory indicators of the development of the 
economy in 1994 obtained by the government of the Russian 
Federation show that stronger tendencies toward stabilization 
have been observed. 
  According to predictions, in 1994 inflation rates will drop 
by half, the decline in the volumes of industrial production 
will be only 6 percent, with more than twofold--in light 
industry, the volume of investments will stabilize, and the 
federal budget deficit will not exceed 6 percent of the gross 
domestic product. 
  Thus the new type of economy that has developed during the 
years of reform is beginning to settle into a stable operating 
routine, although still with certain interruptions. Primary 
transformations have been carried out, which have made it 
possible to create the foundations of a market economy to 
replace the administrative-command system. 
  But the modern Russian market is still imperfect in many 
ways. On the one hand, the roots of the administrative system 
have remained--there is an extremely strong dependence of 
enterprises and entrepreneurs on decisions of bureaucrats. On 
the other hand, many of the worst features of a market 
environment are appearing. These include, above all, the lack of 
real legal protection for citizens and enterprises and the lack 
of responsibility on the part of participants in economic 
activity to their partners, consumers, and the state. 
  Today, now that the primary reforms have basically been 
completed, it is necessary to earmark new points of reference 
for work for the restoration and development of the Russian 
economy in the immediate future. 
<H5>  Putting Economic Legislation in Order </H5>
  One of the major priorities, in whose realization the 
Federal 
Assembly will play a special role, is to eliminate the chaos in 
economic legislation and the practice of its application, which 
plays a large negative role in the development of the crisis. 
The lack of the necessary laws, disparate and contradictory 
acts, and constant revisions of previously adopted decisions 
make it impossible for industrialists and entrepreneurs to work 
normally. 
  The practice of adopting special decisions regarding 
individual branches and enterprises is having an extremely 
negative effect. It violates the unity of the economic 
mechanism, gives rise to bureaucratic omnipotence and 
corruption, and perverts the motivation for the operation of the 
enterprises (not work but consumer demand and "pushing through" 
advantageous administrative decisions become the main focus). 
  Finally, there is no real responsibility on the part of the 
enterprises to their partners, clients, and the state. It is 
necessary to create an effective and rapidly functioning 
mechanism for judicial resolution of economic disputes and, the 
main thing, provide for implementation of decisions that are 
made. 
  The essential needs of a rapidly changing economy require 
continuous improvement of economic legislation. But it is 
necessary to achieve good structure and eliminate 
contradictoriness of the legislative system and to get away from 
the chaos in the adoption of normative acts. 
  The following should be included among the legislative acts 
subject to adoption in the near future: 
  --A new civil code. 
  --On the state budget of the Russian Federation for 1994. 
  --On the interaction of the budgets of various levels. 
  --On a change in the country's tax system. 
  --On a three-year moratorium on making changes to economic 
and legal legislation. 
  --On mechanisms and guarantees of repatriation of the profit 
of foreign investors. 
  --On mandatory auctions when the state grants export 
licenses, rights to work deposits of minerals, rights to fulfill 
certain state orders and functions, and other property rights. 
  --On concessions and other kinds of leasing of state land 
and 
mineral and other resources. 
  --On state credits (privatization, investment, tax, etc.). 
  --On economic legal proceedings. 
  It is necessary to draw up and approve a strict schedule for 
the adoption of these laws. Delays are inadmissible--the 
president may wait, but the economy will not wait. 
  The new Civil Code along with the Constitution of Russia 
that 
was adopted should be a reliable guarantee of the rights of 
Russian citizens in all areas, including economic. It is on the 
basis of these documents that the rest of the areas of 
legislation should be built. 
  Democratization of economic legislation will be an essential 
task. This does not mean to produce more and more restrictions 
on the activity of industrialists and entrepreneurs but, on the 
contrary, to direct all innovations in economic legislation 
toward easing the tax and administrative burden of the commodity 
producers. 
  After changing the tax system it will be necessary to 
introduce a moratorium (say, for three years) on new taxes and 
increased rates of taxes and deductions currently in effect. 
Everyone stands to gain from the introduction of such a 
moratorium. A new source of stability will appear in the 
country--and, consequently, more of the enterprise's attention 
will be devoted to questions of development and not immediate 
survival. Additionally, it will be possible to reveal the 
weaknesses of the tax system with greater precision after three 
years. 
  It is necessary to increase the effectiveness of laws and 
devote more attention to responsibility for their execution. 
Democracy turns into chaos if the popular saying "the law is a 
drive shaft: whichever way you turn it, it will go," remains in 
effect. 
  All we have to do is change the laws to accommodate 
immediate 
interests or interpret them at our own discretion to suit 
political ambitions--and instability in society will immediately 
increase and tension will grow. 
<H5>  Relations Between the Center and the Regions </H5>
  The provisions of the Federation Treaty on delimitation of 
authority have still not been fully realized. "Work with the 
territories" frequently becomes a tug-of-war. 
  The new Constitution clearly defined the functions of the 
Center and the regions. In order for these provisions not to 
remain merely on paper it is necessary to organize the process 
for transferring to components of the Federation functions that 
are not assigned to the Federation and resources for fulfilling 
them. 
  The constant conflicts because of transferring taxes to the 
Center and funds from the federal budget to the regions are 
inadmissible. It is necessary to completely separate the tax 
systems of the Federation and its components, granting the 
regions the necessary financial resources and tax authority. 
  It is necessary to combine independence of the components of 
the Federation and normal functioning of the vertical executive 
structure in performing functions of federal power. To do this, 
local organs of federal departments should be created in the 
regions. Their functions should be limited to the ones assigned 
in the Constitution to the Federation, precluding intervention 
in the authority of its components. 
  The Constitution has strengthened the equality of the 
components of the Federation, which means that there should be a 
standard approach when granting them subsidies, benefits, etc. 
and standard criteria for adopting these decisions (level of 
employment, average per capita income, etc.). 
  The Constitution and the federal laws must be regarded as 
the 
minimum of rights guaranteed to citizens and enterprises 
throughout the entire territory of Russia. Components of the 
Federation may use their own resources to expand these rights 
without restriction, but in no case may they restrict civil 
liberties, social guarantees, or the possibilities of conducting 
entrepreneurial activity. 
<H5>  Support for Russian Industry </H5>
  The need for financial support for domestic industry is 
obvious and nobody questions it. Throughout the entire 
transition period, state intervention in the economy and 
financial support for it will be unavoidable. The entire 
question is how to carry out this intervention and provide this 
support. 
  Today immense state investments are being made in the 
economy 
in such a way as to reinforce not market but antimarket 
tendencies. 
  Mutual offsetting of debts or preferential credit are 
dangerous not only because they could produce a new wave of 
inflation. What is even worse is that they generate attitudes of 
dependency among commodity producers and orient them not toward 
market demand but toward passive anticipation of help from the 
state. 
  Indeed, why should an enterprise director be concerned about 
studying the market, reprofiling production, and updating the 
assortment if it is possible, as usual, to crank out products 
that nobody needs, and when the enterprise, its warehouses 
crammed full, ends up actually bankrupt, threaten the government 
with mass unemployment and social upheaval and have its debts 
written off again and be granted new credit? 
  As a result, products nobody needs continue to be produced 
and the problem of nonpayments is renewed from year to year. 
  The state must help the enterprises provide for product 
sales 
and not give them an unconditional opportunity to continue to 
produce items that nobody buys. To accomplish this it is 
necessary to change the direction for granting state funds: 
Credit should be extended not to the producer but to the 
consumer so that he can buy the products he really needs. 
  We must especially look into a form of organization of sales 
that is widely used in world practice and is almost unknown in 
our country. It involves leasing companies which purchase costly 
technical equipment from the producer and lease it to the actual 
users. 
  It is precisely in the creation of these companies in all 
branches that operate costly technology and equipment that state 
credit should be invested. This way we will help update the 
fixed capital of the enterprises of these branches and, the main 
thing, we will force the producer actually to take consumer 
demand into account. Because the leasing company will place an 
order only for equipment that is in demand. 
  This mechanism will make it possible to reveal the group of 
producers whose products nobody needs and actually put in motion 
a bankruptcy procedure that has been discussed for a long time 
without results. 
  Of course, such market mechanisms as leasing companies 
function effectively if they have participating in them not only 
state but also private capital, which is vitally interested in 
profit. The creation of such companies with mixed capital has 
the added advantage that it makes it possible to draw into the 
production sphere Russian entrepreneurs who are not yet strong 
enough to decide on large-scale investment without the state as 
a partner. 
  We see another means of shifting state support from the 
producer to the consumer in the granting of monetary subsidies 
directly to the citizens. The first experiment of this kind was 
conducted in connection with the rejection of state subsidies 
for the production of bread. It should be utilized more widely. 
  And if an enterprise cannot sell its items, it is necessary 
to speak precisely about social aid for its workers and about 
targeted and strictly controlled credit for reprofiling, and not 
about endless subsidies for the continuation of unnecessary 
production. Such outlays are much more justified than the 
expenditure of more and more billions on the production of 
products of yesterday. 
  The essence of all these mechanisms is that the state 
supports the consumer and he, with his ruble, votes for the 
enterprises that are capable of finding their place in a market 
economy. Only when we master this will we be able to launch a 
structural rearrangement of production on market principles and 
create incentives for satisfying the effective demand. 
  In addition to this the state must assist in the structural 
rearrangement of industry, in increasing its ability to compete 
and in its profitability, and in reducing expenditures. One of 
the areas where this work can be seen is purposeful utilization 
of "natural monopolies" that belong to the state--nationwide 
transportation, communications, and energy networks. 
  The establishment of prices and rates for the services of 
these monopolies must be strictly controlled and be subordinated 
to tasks of the state economic policy. For many goods today the 
lion's share of the production costs, sometimes up to 40 
percent, is made up of expenditures on transportation (and, for 
example, for newspapers--on communications workers). 
  For the period of stabilization special financial conditions 
must be established for state networks of nationwide 
significance that are protectionist with regard to Russian 
producers. It is necessary to establish lower rates and to 
prevent their arbitrary increase by local leaders of the 
corresponding services. Thus significant financial aid will be 
rendered to all of Russian industry. At the same time it will be 
possible to refrain from individual support of enterprises, 
which creates unequal conditions for them, and utilize the 
released budget funds for maintaining the technical level and 
wages and for the development of federal systems of 
transportation and communications and energy engineering. 
<H5>  Development of Privatization </H5>
  The program for privatization of state enterprises was one 
of 
the few state programs with detailed development and a 
well-arranged mechanism for implementation. The year 1994 will 
be one for summing up the results of its first 
stage--privatization of state enterprises through the use of 
privatization checks issued to the population. 
  The goals of the privatization program are multifaceted. 
Among them are political ones--returning to citizens of Russia 
their share of the national wealth; social--the formation of a 
large segment of private owners; and economic--the reform of 
property relations in Russia. The results of the activity of the 
government and the course of privatization show that we are 
consistently coming closer to our earmarked goals. 
  At the same time today we are experiencing an ever greater 
need to shift from global transformations to solutions to 
current problems of the economic reform. Based on this, we 
consider it necessary to coordinate issues of privatization with 
structural rearrangement of the economy and modernization and 
retooling of Russian industry. 
  Mass check privatization will be completed on 30 June. After 
that there should be an increase in the role of other methods, 
which are oriented more not toward social ends but toward high 
economic effectiveness of the privatized sector. These include, 
above all, investment competitions which demand from the buyers 
of enterprises unconditional implementation of a program of 
investment in the development and modernization of production. 
  There are also great prospects for the sale of state 
property 
in installments--through a system of special privatization 
credit. This system should open up access to property for those 
Russians who are able to organize production but do not have 
sufficient initial capital for this--the corps of directors and 
professional managers. 
<H5>  Continuation of the Land Reform </H5>
  An important step in the development of economic 
transformations was the decision to remove unjustified 
restrictions from buying and selling plots of land and the 
formation of the basics of a civilized real estate market. The 
president signed the corresponding edict on regulation of land 
relations and work was done in the government to improve 
individual areas of the functioning of the land market. 
  At the same time today we have far from a complete package 
of 
the necessary normative documents on land law. There is a 
critical need for an integrated code of laws on land that 
establishes the rights and responsibilities of its owners and 
delimits authority in regulating land relations at the level of 
the Federation. This is one of the most important issues facing 
the country which the new Russian parliament can resolve. 
Further liberalization of relations involving ownership of the 
land and its legislative formulation are necessary not only for 
the development of agriculture but also for the development and 
the most rapid stabilization of the economy as a whole. 
  At the same time liberalization of land relations should not 
lead to a loss of state control over the land market, especially 
the utilization of land for agricultural purposes. It is 
necessary to consider the question of introducing the status of 
land under federal jurisdiction for some of the agricultural 
land that has strategic significance for all of Russia. 
<H5>  Reform of the Banking System </H5>
  The development of domestic industry will be successful only 
if it is based on a solid banking system. Far from everything is 
going well in this sphere in our country. 
  The Central Bank system has not acquired the flexibility 
needed under conditions of a market economy. As before there is 
domination by all kinds of continuously changing instructions, 
letters, and telegrams sent by the Central Bank. It is becoming 
increasingly difficult to figure out this pile of them. 
  Even worse is that the Central Bank's independence 
frequently 
ends up to be arbitrariness with respect to the commercial banks 
and sometimes also with respect to all the population and 
enterprises of the country (as was the case during the summer 
money exchange). 
  The work of the Central Bank requires restructuring and 
reform, not shock therapy, but extremely cautious reform that 
does not disturb the normal operation of the banking system as a 
whole. It is necessary to take advantage of all the best that 
has been accumulated in world experience in management of the 
monetary-credit sphere and in the work and organization of 
central banking systems. 
  As for the development of the domestic banking system, we 
still have to determine the limit beyond which protection of 
national economic interests becomes patronage for inefficient 
structures that ignore the interests of the clients and are 
incapable of providing them service at the level of modern 
standards. 
  Protectionist measures must, in the first place, be 
carefully 
weighed so as not to go beyond the limits actually dictated by 
national economic interests and, in the second place, be 
combined with increasingly strict requirements on the quality of 
the operation of domestic banks so as not to preserve the 
backwardness but gradually to bring them up to the real world's 
level. 
<H5>  Development of Currency Regulation </H5>
  Up until recently questions of currency regulation have been 
among the most difficult problems of economic policy. The 
condition of the Russian economy is fatally affected by such 
phenomena as illegal exportation of capital, the diversion of 
immense funds for currency speculation rather than production 
use, branch and regional lobbying in connection with the receipt 
of currency and other foreign economic privileges. The 
development of currency control and the regulation and sharp 
reduction of benefits and special conditions make up an 
essential task. 
  Stabilization of the foreign currency exchange rate for the 
ruble is another one of the most important tasks. The economy is 
not yet ready for a fixed rate. But it is necessary to introduce 
into practice the establishment of points of reference for 
changing the exchange rate for the near future and provide for 
their observance through measures of state policy. This will 
create a certain stability for industrialists and investors, and 
will help to shift immense funds involved in currency 
speculations to production use. 
  Right now we must begin working to prepare for transferring 
Russia's foreign trade to ruble accounts. Such conditions for 
accounts for foreign trade operations are typical for developed 
countries with market economies. As the country's economic 
situation stabilizes, this task will be increasingly crucial. We 
must purposefully prepare the economic and political conditions 
for this decision. 
  With the introduction of such a system there will be a sharp 
increase in the supply of currency on the Russian market, since 
the entire volume of export proceeds of Russian enterprises will 
pass through it. Moreover, there will be a steady and 
significant demand for rubles on the part of foreign buyers of 
Russian goods (including raw materials). This not only means an 
important step toward convertibility of the ruble but it also 
creates preconditions for the ruble's entry into foreign 
currency exchanges. 
  The very concept of foreign currency accounts of enterprises 
will disappear. From the very beginning rubles will be 
transferred into the exporter's account, and the importer will 
also use rubles to pay foreign sellers through his bank for 
goods that are purchased. 
  Such an accounting procedure is an important element in the 
system of currency control. It will place a barrier on the path 
to illegal exportation of capital abroad and make an essential 
contribution to the stabilization of the ruble as a currency 
used in the world market, even if it is on a very limited scale 
at first. 
  The task of stabilizing the ruble exchange rate and 
introducing it into international settlements should also be a 
reference point for the legislative organ when preparing 
documents regulating monetary circulation and the monetary 
policy of the Russian federation. 
<H3>  Protection of National Economic Interests and the New 
Foreign Political Doctrine </H3>
  Russia's entry into the world market is objectively 
predetermined and it has not only economic but also decisive 
domestic political significance. 
  Even today it has been clearly revealed that a considerable 
share of Russian enterprises are trying to export their 
products. For many of them (for example, high technological 
ones) this is the only possibility of surviving under modern 
conditions whereby domestic sales have dropped sharply and the 
state has no possibility of providing adequate support. 
  Thus the opening of foreign markets for Russian goods was 
predetermined by an objective process, and it directly involves 
the interests of tens of thousands of enterprises and millions 
of their workers. All these people are real or potential bearers 
of the ideology of Russia's entry into the world market. Such 
mass support and interest means that Russian goods will 
definitely go on to the world market. The only question is 
whether this will be sooner or later, in civilized or savage 
forms, and because of the government or in spite of it. 
  With their votes, their work, and their resources these 
people and their enterprises are capable of giving real support 
to the government that carries out this task. Conversely, 
indecisiveness, delays, and especially disregard for this 
problem by the government will actively place them in opposition 
and force them to seek other channels, bypassing the current 
authorities, for integration into the world economy, and also to 
rely on other political forces. 
  Consequently, success in solving foreign political problems 
will make an essential contribution to the development of the 
domestic political situation. This is one of the factors that 
form the social base of the reforms and the reformers, which 
determine the credit of confidence and support we have for 
conducting our policy. 
  The solution to the problem of entry into the world market 
hinges mainly on inadequate foreign political support. 
  The reorientation of foreign policy toward priority 
partnership with the leading developed countries, which has 
taken place in recent years, has certain shortcomings along with 
its obvious merits. There has been a sharp reduction of Russia's 
presence in traditional foreign markets (for example, the 
countries of Eastern Europe and the Near East), and the 
potential for cooperation with developing and new industrial 
countries (South Korea, Taiwan) is being inadequately utilized. 
  At the same time, relations between Russia and the West are 
developing asymmetrically at the present time. The developed 
countries are not at all inclined to allow Russia into 
international markets in response to the development of 
political cooperation. 
  Our partners consistently protect the interests of their 
producers from Russian competition, and Western countries are 
preserving discriminatory measures against Russian goods and 
preventing their penetration into their own markets and even 
into the markets of "third countries" (an example is the 
memorable story of the delivery of rocket engines to India). 
  The developed countries are applying antidumping measures 
against Russian goods and introducing prohibitive duties on our 
products (for example, 104 percent on deliveries of ferrosilicon 
from Russia to the United States). The quotas assigned to Russia 
in many cases are linked to deliveries from the CIS as a whole, 
which aggravates relations within the framework of the 
Commonwealth because of the distribution of these quotas. And 
the amounts of the quotas are frequently ridiculous. According 
to the data of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, say, 
for sheet metal the quota of the European communities for 
Bulgaria is 53,000 tonnes, for Romania--45,000 tonnes, and for 
all of the CIS--49,000 tonnes. Italy allows the shipment from 
Russia of nine (!) engines, 29 motorcycles, etc. 
  These political restrictions cannot be removed by purely 
economic methods. It is necessary to have a consistent and firm 
policy of protection of national economic interests that is 
enforced in all foreign political activity. This pertains both 
to cooperation with Western states and to the restoration of 
mutually advantageous trade and economic ties with the former 
socialist countries and to political support for Russia's entry 
into the markets of developing and new industrial countries with 
competitive and highly technological goods, machines and 
equipment, and raw and processed materials. 
  Thus political support must play a decisive role in the 
restoration of Russian exports and their distribution in new 
foreign markets. This problem is not being resolved effectively 
enough today. It is necessary to adopt and consistently 
implement a new foreign political doctrine that protects 
Russia's national interests. It is important to find a form in 
which foreign policy would reflect in a balanced way both the 
political and the economic interests of our country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice </F>
faction in the State Duma, by Aleksandr Bekker; place and date 
not given: "Yegor Gaydar: The Academicians' Program is a `Very 
Interesting Document.' It Clarifies Why the USSR Economy 
Collapsed"] 
  [Text] It is expected that today the State Duma will 
conduct parliamentary hearings devoted to programs of economic 
reform and anticrisis measures. The impact caused by the 
parliamentary elections on the moods of the political leaders of 
Russia was extremely significant. In this connection one can 
expect that the results of the hearings will be taken into 
account by the government when it determines the plan for 
further measures. 
  SEGODNYA offers its readers an interview with the 
leader of the Russia's Choice faction in the State Duma, Yegor 
Gaydar, who previously defended the government program from 
attack by the Supreme Soviet and is now criticizing developments 
for changing this program proposed to the government by a group 
of Russian academicians. 
  [Bekker] Anatoliy Chubays called the proposals from 
academicians Shatalin, Abalkin, and Petrakov for changing the 
course of the reforms "economically absurd." Do you too consider 
them to be unworthy of professional attention? 
  [Gaydar] No, it is a very interesting document. It makes it 
possible to guess the riddle of the 20th century--why did the 
generally inert economy of the Soviet Union collapse so quickly? 
Of course, by 1985 it was severely ill. But in order to 
completely destroy the consumer market and financial system in 
six years and by the end of 1991 to leave the country without 
currency reserves or grain supplies--one had to try very hard to 
accomplish this. 
  [Bekker] And you mean to say that this striking result was 
achieved by a set of measures similar to the ones proposed in 
the report by the scholars? 
  [Gaydar] Yes. Take such a proposal as state regulation of 
prices of the most important raw material commodities. They do 
not reveal precisely which ones, but apparently they are the 
products of the fuel and energy complex and, possibly, 
nonferrous and ferrous metals and products of chemistry. The 
regulation would be introduced against a background of 
large-scale financial infusions, working capital of enterprises 
and the savings of the population would be indexed, and capital 
investments, expenditures on conversion and the social sphere, 
and critical imports would increase. 
  The consequences are obvious: the sharpest disproportions 
would arise between regulated and free prices. As a result, 
after a short period of time even with the present rates of 
inflation, oil, gas, and practically all goods on which prices 
are frozen would begin to be produced at a loss. There would be 
a need for a large financial influx to cover the needs of these 
branches. Otherwise there will simply be nothing with which to 
pay wages and nothing with which to buy electric energy and 
spare parts. 
  [Bekker] But the report suggests establishing a certain 
rational relationship among parts for branch goods. 
  [Gaydar] In the first place, who knows what this ratio is? 
In 
the second place, it is not simple to do that. In two months 
inflation could bring products, say, from machine building to a 
new price level, and in order not to shut down the fuel and 
energy complex the government would have to scrape together 
funds from the budget. But the disparity in prices would get 
ever deeper and ever more subsidies would be required, the 
budget deficit would start to grow and unfixed prices would rise 
ever more rapidly. 
  Further--there would be two other consequences. If the 
demand 
for metal were greater than the supply of metal at suppressed 
prices, a waiting line would form for it and the seller would 
determine whether to provide it or not based on who satisfies 
certain of his additional needs, say, through barter. And the 
second thing: there would arise a need to control this 
distribution. And then there would appear the boss who decides 
who gets what limits and funds and assignments. A sector of 
deficit distribution would develop in the economy. 
  [Bekker] And inevitably it would be necessary to restore the 
Gossnab [State Committee for Material and Technical Supply] in 
order to divide up the deficit and the Gosplan [State Planning 
Committee] in order to determine the national economic 
proportions and calculate interbranch balances. 
  [Gaydar] Well, naturally. The report masks this with a 
euphemism--"the state will undertake to play the game." But 
what will the "player" do when he finds out that first metal has 
ceased to be very profitable and then it is produced at a loss, 
and then there is nowhere to get the money to pay the wages of 
the metallurgists, and then strikes begin at the combines. Of 
course, under pressure the government will give in and raise 
prices. But not by 15 percent, as is now happening in the 
market, but three- to four-fold, since by that time the other 
prices will be rising sharply. As a result, throughout the 
entire economy a powerful pro-inflation impulse will be set in 
motion. That is, instead of making it possible for the 
enterprises, hard as it may be for them, to adapt each day to 
the changes in the proportions, you will reorganize them once 
every four months and beat them over the head with a club. And 
then see how they react to that. 
  [Bekker] After all, just in July the government finally 
released prices for petroleum and stopped regulating grain 
prices. 
  [Gaydar] Indeed, the minute they have achieved something 
they 
are immediately ready to drive up the high cost waves, 
reproducing price distortions and an immense load on the budget. 
The esteemed academicians say that this is being done in order 
to bring the prices in the branches up to normative ratios. In 
principle it is possible to achieve this by two methods. 
First--slightly influence supply and demand; introduce export 
and import tariffs and stimulate the importing or exporting of 
goods. The second is to assign prices. To say that they will be 
this or that. 
  [Bekker] Is that what the State Committee on Prices has been 
doing? 
  [Gaydar] Yes. This system would have to be made 
all-encompassing. Because if you regulate prices for knitted 
goods, you automatically have to control the price of cotton. 
And then there arises the problem of equal advantage in 
producing products which was well known in Soviet times. This 
problem practically does not exist now: products are sold at the 
prices at which they are sold. In the academicians' version we 
are given a deficit and an escape from producing disadvantageous 
products. If you know that it is impossible to buy many batching 
items and spare parts at any price, you will have to construct, 
without any of these absurdities, an integrated price regulation 
system. 
  [Bekker] Plus the system for regulating incomes and wages 
through the State Committee on Labor and Social Problems. 
  [Gaydar] Sure. And for orders on prices and wages to be 
carried out they must be backed up by strict sanctions and 
legislative rights for state organs. For instance, if someone 
refuses to produce the necessary kind of fitting the authorities 
must have the possibility of firing the leader or giving a 
reprimand. But here is the problem: all of this somehow cannot 
exist in a private economy. 
  In order for there to be no cracks in the system, it is 
necessary, as was said in the report, to abandon the populist 
voucher privatization and begin the reverse 
process--nationalization. Then events will develop in the 
standard way on the consumer market. As soon as the monetary 
assets of the population grow as a result of indexation and 
prices, according to the advice of the academicians, are fixed, 
the government itself will be very bewildered when it discovers 
that again nothing can be bought for the money. And that again 
it is necessary to go from Tula to Moscow, stand in lines, 
introduce ration cards, divide up the supplies of meat products, 
go to the capital to try to scare some up, have good relations 
with the salesmen, and have a foot in the back door. In brief, 
all the charms about which we have forgotten somewhat will come 
creeping back, although in terms of time they are not far behind 
us. 
  In our history there existed a great organ--the Commission 
on 
Distribution of Material Resources. It died quietly and 
unnoticed in 1922 with the liberalization of the economy and the 
introduction of a relatively stable currency. And very quickly 
it turned up restored in expanded form as soon as a set of 
measures painfully similar to the ones proposed in January 1994 
were implemented. 
  [Bekker] You have not yet touched on an important element of 
the academicians' concept: they assert that administrative 
regulation will halt the decline of production and make it 
possible to saturate the commodity market. 
  [Gaydar] The scale of financial disproportions that will 
follow such a measure will be incomparable to the current 
fluctuations and production volumes. As a result of such a 
decision the demand will automatically increase not by 2 percent 
or even by 10 percent but several-fold. Because this is a 
monetary phenomenon. 
  According to this scenario, stabilization or at least 
retardation of the rates of decline of production would be 
possible only under the condition that the authorities fully and 
effectively restore the previous system of management. But I am 
convinced that now it would take years of deep crisis in order 
to arrange a normally functioning Gosplan, Gossnab, and 50 
branches of ministries, to restore the old ties, to cast off 
privatization, and to again adapt to the discipline of fear. 
  We are now living under the conditions of a very painful 
intersystem transformation whereby the old system has been 
broken down and a new one is just being built. And here, without 
hanging on, without being patient, in general, a 
year...experience shows that in a postcommunist economy 
financial stabilization comes in the third year of reform, and 
production begins to increase in the fourth. Instead of 
continuing things, they are now beginning to turn this machine 
back, that is, worsen the condition of systemless chaos. How and 
from what will production all of a sudden begin to grow in this 
situation--this is absolutely incomprehensible. 
  [Bekker] But yet in certain periods of 1992 and 1993, when 
the government and the Central Bank had increased monetary 
emissions and unleased the nonpayment crisis, production was 
clearly invigorated. 
  [Gaydar] That was a very short-term and transitory result 
which was swept away with the next wave of disproportions. No, 
of course, if in three years you restore strict total control of 
the state, if you bring back fully the administrative-command 
system of management and force the population to tighten their 
belts, in time production volume could stabilize and the 
preconditions for a certain growth could even appear. But there 
is no reason to think that anybody will be happy because of 
this. Because the volume of economic activity never signifies 
its effectiveness. This is simply the quantity of shovelled 
resources: the volume of ditches you dig, the number of tanks 
you rivet. After this you will completely deprive the economy of 
the set of microregulators that were vitally necessary and 
because of which, actually, the old system of administration 
collapsed. Innovations? Why are they innovations? Economic 
utilization of resources--from what item? Having poured capital, 
labor, and resources out of ineffective branches--nothing of the 
kind. The maximum you can do with a great deal of labor is 
preserve the archaic economic structure, which will drag the 
country into the web of backwardness. 
  [Bekker] Boris Yeltsin, having the academicians' work in 
mind, said that "such advice had already been given." But 
Messrs. Petrakov and Abalkin were not working on a public basis 
but on instructions from First Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets. 
To what extent, in your view, is Viktor Chernomyrdin prepared to 
listen to the president's assessment today? 
  [Gaydar] I do not think that Viktor Stepanovich will decide 
to implement the complex of recommendations contained in this 
report. Moreover, all the proposals are in the intermediate 
phase. If the academicians were to write down what we have just 
discussed, that is, the set of consequences and the set of 
institutions that would have to be formed immediately in this 
connection--beginning with deprivatization of the economy and 
ending with the restoration of direct specific administration of 
all flows of resources--that would be some kind of integrated 
and comprehensible program. Well, say, the program of 
counterreforms. But in the present form it is simply a program 
for restoring the chaos of 1990-1991. It is doubtful that the 
prime minister would even dream of this. 
  [Bekker] You probably know his program plans. 
  [Gaydar] No, but I do know that Viktor Stepanovich has not 
lost his mind. The academicians' concept contains certain 
shortcomings that are obvious and, in my opinion, apparent even 
to the non-specialist. Let me put it this way: I would be 
surprised if the government would have the courage to 
consistently implement what is presented there. 
  It is presented, incidentally, in an extremely contradictory 
way. In one place the government is reproached for its extremely 
strict financial policy, for the fact that it has used purely 
monetary means of holding down inflation through limiting 
demand. But two paragraphs above it says: "The government has 
widely used emission as a kind of narcotic for emboldening 
production." The strictest financial policy which proceeds 
against a background of wide use of emission--that is brilliant. 
Or: "In two years they still have not managed to normalize the 
budget system in spite of enlisting immense amounts of credit 
from the Central Bank to cover the budget deficit." Apparently 
the esteemed authors sincerely think that attracting this credit 
is a means of stabilizing the budget systems. 
  [Bekker] The academicians' attack against voucher 
privatization as populist and pro-inflation does not seem 
altogether clear either. According to the State Program, voucher 
privatization will end by 1 July and investment trade for money 
and control of publicly financed enterprises will begin. 
  [Gaydar] Quite right. I especially want to discuss the 
supposedly pro-inflation essence of voucher privatization. Even 
if one proceeds from the assumption that the checks are an 
ersatz means of payment, check privatization is now playing a 
marked stabilizing role since the number of vouchers, which was 
maximal as of 1 January 1993, is decreasing rapidly. This means 
that the total amount of the monetary residuals is increasing 
considerably more slowly. 
  One could argue about whether the emission of vouchers had a 
pro-inflation effect at the end of 1992. That, as it were, is an 
interesting question. But the fact that now if voucher 
privatization has any influence on inflation at all it is only 
in the direction of restraint is obvious to anyone who 
understands anything about the analysis of monetary reserves. So 
the academicians were at least a year and a half late with their 
criticism. 
  [Bekker] And if the chambers of the Federal Assembly approve 
this program as a basis for compromise between the government 
and parliament? 
  [Gaydar] Well, the punishment for experiments of this kind 
will be forced and apparent to society. 
  [Bekker] But the academicians are calling your reforms 
violence against the economy, shock therapy. Moreover, your 
previous friend, when working with Stanislav Shatalin in the 
Central Economics and Mathematics Institute and then a 
like-thinker in the first post-communist government, Aleksandr 
Shokhin, said a couple of days ago that you had resigned in 
order to avoid responsibility for what you had done. 
  [Gaydar] Yes, I heard that. You know, last year we had a 
paradoxical, almost unprecedented situation in which there was a 
strong, energetic prime minister who did not seem to bear 
responsibility for what was happening, which is borne by Gaydar 
who is in retirement. And his colleagues, who have also remained 
in the government, do not seem to have anything to do with this. 
I am not running away from responsibility. I think that was 
clear during 1991-1992. In the autumn of 1993 I came to the 
government at a time that was not the easiest for it. In my 
view, responsibility is inseparable from the possibility of 
implementing the policy that you consider right. As long as I 
was able to implement this policy, I considered it possible and 
necessary to bear responsibility for it and I did not shift it 
to anyone else. But, in my view, to take responsibility 
absolutely does not mean to be chained to the chair regardless 
of fluctuations in the course pursued by the government. It does 
not mean to be omnivorous and it does not mean to be prepared to 
swallow our pride and accommodate any twists in this policy as 
long as you can remain in the loop.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Petrakov, director of the Institute </F>
of Market Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, by T. 
Pomelova; place and date not given: "Reform of Reform: Economic 
Change or Economic Revolution?"] 
  [Text] Opinions regarding the recently declared new state 
policy priorities (easing the excessively tough monetarist 
methods, support of production, etc.) have divided basically 
into two irreconcilable directions. One unconditionally supports 
the strategy and tactics of the radicals who have just left the 
government, and the other just as energetically rejects them. 
The discussion is stimulating the emergence in the world of the 
most diverse projects, programs, and studies, of which the 
greatest prominence was received by the joint report of the 
economics department of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] 
and the Reform International Fund under the title "Socioeconomic 
Reorganization in Russia: Current Situation and New Approaches." 
At the end of last week its authors--Academicians S. Shatalin, 
L. Abalkin, and N. Petrakov--presented their work for the 
consideration of their economist colleagues and also of deputies 
of the State Duma. 
  Tatyana Zaslavskaya and Artem Tarasov and Sergey Baburin and 
Vadim Medvedev, a former member of the CPSU Central Committee, 
were among those who came to the presentation. Not all the 
guests decided to speak at this discussion, to which many 
probably came out of curiosity. But the positions of those who 
nonetheless expressed opinions with regard to the program were 
very contradictory. Just as, however, the program of the "three 
academicians" itself was contradictory. After the meeting we 
were able to interview one of the developers, Nikolay Petrakov, 
director of the RAN Institute of Market Problems. But first, 
here are several quotations from the draft "Socioeconomic 
Reorganization in Russia: Current Situation and New Approaches." 
  "While favorably assessing the movement to a market economy 
that is under way, it is necessary to note the continuously 
increasing, and in many ways excessive, `price' that society has 
already paid and will be compelled to pay for the adopted 
strategy and tactics of the transition to the market. Just in 
the last two years the drop in production, according to the most 
important macro-indices, totaled about 30 percent. In addition, 
it is important to emphasize that the drop in production, first, 
has not a structural but a general character and, second, it hit 
the most progressive and highly technological branches and types 
of production in the greatest degree." 
  "Under current conditions, the loss of volume of production 
is a market loss; moreover, not only of the world market (for 
example, in the aerospace industry, in the production of 
armaments, etc.), but of the domestic market as well. However, 
once having yielded a place on the market, it is extremely 
difficult to regain this niche." 
  "The drop in investment activity is most profound and 
dangerous in its socioeconomic consequences." 
  "It was still not possible after two years to normalize the 
budget system, despite enlisting huge credits of the Central 
Bank and the artificial withdrawal of resources from the Pension 
Fund. The result of unreasoned actions, the payments crisis, and 
the inability to guarantee normal tax receipts only undermined 
the income base of the budget and caused its chronic deficit." 
  "The choice of strategy of socioeconomic reorganization is a 
very complicated process that demands not only detailed 
scientific study but also due regard for the popular will and 
the consent of the leading sociopolitical forces and movements." 
  It is necessary: 
  "to define and formulate the social indicators of reform: 
its 
aims and also boundaries and limits, whose traversal is 
impermissible under any circumstances or for any reason 
(guaranteed subsistence minimum, employment threshold, share of 
expenditures for education and health services in the GNP 
structure, and others)"; 
  "to reject the naive belief in the automatism of improving 
the economy with the help of depersonalized monetarism and to 
restore state regulation in its natural and generally accepted 
functions"; 
  "to switch to new principles of financial stabilization on 
the basis of combining a tough financial-credit policy with 
selective support of priority spheres and production, use of 
various forms of regulation of prices and incomes (including the 
help of establishing price parities, cartel agreements, etc.), 
and perfection of tax and budget policy." 
  [Pomelova] Nikolay Yakovlevich, ex-minister Boris Fedorov in 
his last statement appealed to the president with the statement 
that an economic overturn is occurring in the country. Do you 
agree with such a categorical assertion? 
  [Petrakov] In my opinion, the government is now in a certain 
rigidity: It either faces a change, or it faces a "revolution." 
But this is not the point. I do not entirely understand 
Fedorov's position, also Gaydar's and Chubays'--in a word, 
people of a reformist inclination who steered the economic ship 
of our country. What do the macroeconomic methods they employed 
represent? Two levers were engaged in the fight against 
inflation. First, a sharp reduction in the expenditure part of 
the budget. Second, the same kind of sharp increase in taxes. 
Everything is "transparent," as in school: In order to finance 
the budget, it is necessary to reduce expenditures and increase 
taxes. This is the essence of "shock therapy" in the Russian 
rendition. Moreover, it is proposed that we go further on this 
same simple path. 
  Now, let us take a look at what happens with expenditures. 
Really, expenditures are compressed to all reasonable and 
unreasonable limits. Moreover, reasonableness in the reduction 
of expenditures already exhausted itself in the first half of 
1992. Further, the reduction was already some kind of irrational 
number. As a result, all budgetary spheres fell into poverty. 
Education, culture, science, and health services--wages for 
workers there were lower by a factor of three to eight than in 
industry, not to mention commerce. 
  Or let us take another method, which was used by Minister of 
Finance Fedorov in fighting inflation. This is nonpayment for 
purchased products. It became a tradition to rebuke agriculture 
for the fact that it made requests. But let us analyze this: 
People were told that products were being bought from them at a 
certain price. This was the state order and mandatory deliveries 
that the peasant could not avoid, and he sent all his grain to 
the market. So they set the price, and they received the grain. 
But they did not want to settle accounts. That is, they simply 
took it. Is it possible to consider such methods state economic 
policy? This is no better than the surplus appropriation system 
of the Bolsheviks. These are absolutely not economic methods, 
which for some reason are presented as a monetarist approach. 
  [Pomelova] Can you mention some decisions of the ministers 
who have left that would meet with your approval? 
  [Petrakov] Hardly. When they announced that it was necessary 
to continue, it was not clear just what to continue. We were 
already up against the wall. For example, we could raise tax 
rates more and more. But what will this lead to? After all, 
business activity is already almost stifled by taxes. Instead of 
broadening the tax base and stimulating production with normal 
taxes, they simply took a colossal part of the profits. Although 
this had its own defects, and taxes were simply appropriated. 
  [Pomelova] But after all, there were periods of a real drop 
in inflation during 1993. 
  [Petrakov] But at whose expense did this occur? From the 
standpoint of economists, the temporary successes were achieved 
in a very strange way. In autumn I was invited to an expanded 
meeting of the Council of Ministers, where I heard a report by 
Chernomyrdin. He talked about the fact that the country had 
harvested 100 million tonnes at a time when it was expected that 
115 million tonnes would be harvested. The "full amount was not 
gathered," because agricultural enterprises lacked the financial 
resources, and this means because of an inability to pay for 
fuel and materials. Because the minister of finance delayed the 
allocation of credits for the harvest campaign. In the end he 
issued them nonetheless, but many rayons received the money with 
significant delays. 
  Of course, this had a beneficial effect on the inflation 
indices. But multiply $120 per tonne of grain (this is 
approximately the world price) by 15 million, and you will see 
what the cost of the game came to in the economy. 
  In October, when we also observed a reduction in inflation, 
the situation was somewhat different. At the end of 1993, as at 
the end of 1992, the payments that the government were supposed 
to conduct in November-December were carried over to 
January-February 1994. The total indebtedness was on the order 
of 7.6 trillion rubles [R]. 
  Generally speaking, when a professional comes to the 
leadership of the economy of the country, having a specific 
program, he is obligated to take into account the degree of 
resistance of the "object" to which his program is addressed. 
And if anyone supposed that "shock therapy," which caused a 
lowering of the standard of living for an overwhelming number of 
people, would be favorably received by them, then they are naive 
or infantile. It is necessary to remember the reaction of a 
patient when he is operated on without an anesthetic. 
  [Pomelova] Nikolay Yakovlevich, how can the policy you 
propose with your program be characterized? Is this a complete 
turnaround from the former direction of reform? "Healing the 
wound" after an unsuccessful economic operation? 
  [Petrakov] I think that even if "wounded," we should crawl 
to 
the market. Obviously the 70-year experiment to create an 
alternative socialist economy failed. But today the movement 
toward a market is occurring under conditions that are 
absolutely different from those of two years ago. The present 
stage is distinguished by mass disappointment in market ideas. I 
am not talking, of course, about employers and the employees of 
their firms, but about a majority of the citizens. It is very 
difficult now to change their minds and get them to believe in 
the advantages of a market economy. In essence, good ideas are 
being discredited by unskilfull realization. Nothing has such an 
influence on the mass consciousness as very specific examples 
from everyday life. The examples speak of price increases, pay 
delays... 
  Thus, on the one hand, it is necessary to overcome the 
skepticism of the people, and on the other, the criminalization 
of the Russian economy. After all, prices were demonopolized 
without destroying state monopolies. The latter were under the 
complete command of specific groups of persons who were closer 
to these monopolies. Moreover, they got the right to free price 
formation. These are "capitalists" who do not need a civilized 
market: They do not want competition, clear tax legislation, or 
a well-organized customs service. A semicriminal market suits 
them. But such a market does not give a boost to the economy. 
  This means that it is necessary to create competition and 
develop clear-cut legislation so that our capital remains in 
Russia and foreign capital comes to Russia. 
  [Pomelova] The main argument of your opponents is that every 
kind of assistance to production or the village and any credits 
and privileges in the final analysis hit the pocket of the same 
impoverished population: After all, where else can income for 
the budget be obtained, if not from the purses of citizens, by 
imposing ever higher taxes on them? 
  [Petrakov] I am convinced that taxes should be lowered right 
now. Moreover, possibly, double taxation of enterprises should 
be abandoned, inasmuch as the value added tax already includes 
in itself a tax on profit. 
  On the other hand, why are we raising taxes? In order to pay 
an acceptable wage to officers, teachers, and doctors. And they 
have to be paid more and more, because prices are increasing. 
But why are prices increasing? Because any new tax or an 
increase in the rate of an already existing tax is already 
included in the price. We have a monopolized market, a 
producer's market; consequently, all costs are immediately 
included in the price. A person sees another increase in prices, 
he goes on strike, and his wage is increased. And so on, 
endlessly. That which we gain on taxes, we right away lose on 
wages. The tax becomes one of the main inflationary factors. 
  [Pomelova] Is it possible unequivocally to divide methods of 
managing the economy into market and antimarket methods? 
  [Petrakov] Imagine street traffic. It is subject to specific 
rules, you cannot drive through a red light or make a turn in an 
unauthorized place. But you are free to drive to wherever you 
want. But you can also be issued a travel authorization sheet 
that strictly directs movement from point A to point B, and even 
to load up with sand. The first example is a market measure, the 
second a nonmarket measure. 
  Taxes, privileges, and various interest rates for 
credits--these are market measures. In other words, market 
measures are an expression of the state's priorities. 
  [Pomelova] Are there any guarantees that support of 
production and the agrarian sector and the accelerated increase 
in the standard of living of citizens will not lead to a 
"Ukrainization" of the Russian economy? 
  [Petrakov] The difficult economic situation in Ukraine is 
caused by quite specific errors on the part of the Ukrainian 
leadership. But other factors should also not be forgotten. This 
country does not possess the necessary economic 
self-sufficiency. It has practically no energy sources. It 
imports oil, gas, and timber from Russia at world prices. But 
the export capabilities of Ukraine are extremely limited: 
Consumer goods produced there are of a low quality, and the West 
does not need agricultural products at all. Farmers are being 
paid there not to expand production. Thus, the sources of hard 
currency revenues are extremely limited, and this is the main 
reason for the decline in the Ukrainian economy. 
  The situation in Russia is entirely different. Energy 
resources keep us and will continue to keep us afloat. But our 
inflation rates give no justification to boast before Ukraine. 
When they say that the ruble has started working, they do not 
mention that they want to spend it immediately. And until it 
becomes a means of accumulation, it will remain a falling 
currency, and until that time we will be unable to ensure normal 
business activity. [end Petrakov] 
  From the editorial office. The draft 
"Socioeconomic Reorganization in Russia: Current Situation and 
New Approaches" has evoked a lot of criticism. In our opinion, 
it suffers from excessive emotionalism in its assessment of the 
policy being conducted and of the politicians who are conducting 
it. On the other hand, the specific approaches proposed by the 
authors to put their program into practice are not entirely 
clear. For example, lowering taxes and in this way expanding the 
tax base (that is, the number of enterprise commodity producers 
and the volume of products that they produce) can improve the 
budget only in the future, and not in the very near future. At 
whose expense should production, which is dying today, be 
supported? 
  Nevertheless, the program has sharply stated a problem to 
which we can no longer remain thoughtlessly indifferent. The 
drop in production has reached a critical line. But production 
in our country is not only an economic factor, it is also a 
social and political factor. Its crash is capable of provoking a 
crash of stability in Russia. It is also impossible not to 
mention Artem Tarasov's praise regarding the study: "Perhaps 
this is the first time we are being familiarized with a draft of 
an economic concept that can be discussed, and not with a ready 
guide for action published in a newspaper."

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Yasin: "A Program Which Cannot Be </F>
Realized"] 
<H5>  [9 Feb p 2] </H5>
  [Text] Before expressing my opinion on the program for 
socioeconomic reforms in Russia submitted by a group of 
prominent scientists, I would like to say a few words in place 
of an introduction. I have mixed feelings with respect to the 
persons who were named among its authors. After all, I worked 
with them for many years and I am very friendly with them, 
despite what they write and the kinds of views they express. I 
am deeply convinced of their high values and respectability. 
This makes it more complicated to evaluate the document they 
drafted. Nevertheless, in pointing out the prism of personal 
relationships, I realize that the public is not very concerned 
about my emotions in this regard. 
  I would single out three elements, three lines, in this 
document. The first concerns the critical assessment of the 
current situation and the condition of the Russian economy. A 
great deal is right here, and many facts which attest to the 
situation that has taken shape are absolutely correct: it is 
really alarming and precarious. I do not think there can be any 
particular disagreement about this. 
  Moreover, I do not think it possible to share the views of 
those who reassure us somehow and maintain that nothing in 
particular, nothing alarming, is taking place and that 
everything is more or less normal. I do not think we can permit 
ourselves to make such an assessment now and over the next 
several years. 
  Second. In my view, the assessment of the situation, mainly 
its roots, the underlying causes, is subjective in nature to a 
significant degree. The persons who made the assessment are 
honest and reputable, of course. Although not all their names 
were given. All the same, it is one-sided, and it seems to me 
that this is not suitable for an academic approach to 
consideration of a problem. 
  What does the lack of objectivity consist of? First of all, 
the unequivocally negative conclusion about the intention and 
progress of those reforms which were implemented in 1992 and 
1993, the condemnation of monetarism and price liberalization. 
It seemed to me that an objective analysis of the positive 
changes and shifts in the economy, mainly toward a transition to 
the market, would have been more appropriate. But these shifts 
are completely obvious, and only a blind person can fail to see 
them. 
  Those who were called upon for many years to restructure the 
Soviet planned economy into a market economy ought to have 
turned their attention to this. I am deeply convinced personally 
that objectively, regardless of anyone's will or wishes, we 
approached a turning point at the end of 1991 when there should 
have been a breakthrough. By that time, we could no longer 
continue on a evolutionary path. I have written about this many 
times, and I continue to hold the same view. 
  There were other alternatives as well, of course. But then 
the program's authors should have said what these alternatives 
were and the price we would have to pay for them. My analysis 
shows that the ones which could have been proposed for that 
period and later, through 1992, would have resulted in more 
severe consequences than the ones which exist now. For this 
reason, it is not right to make a categorical judgment about 
what is worse and what is better in this case: when some plan 
has already been implemented, the alternatives which were not 
put into effect always can seem better. 
  I insist: a sensible, unbiased analysis shows that other 
alternatives would have been worse. What I observed, working 
together with L. Abalkin in N. Ryzhkov's government, convinced 
me: the gradual, evolutionary path of development which was 
conceived in the political and economic situation at that time 
led to a catastrophe. A breakthrough was inevitable sooner or 
later. 
  It took place. The consequences turned out to be severe, not 
only because of errors and miscalculations in the work of the 
Gaydar government, but the problems which had accumulated before 
then. I would say that the scale of the challenge was much 
greater than human abilities to respond to it so that everything 
turned out all right, so that no one suffered, so that there 
were no complaints from the academicians. 
  This is why they are not assessing the situation as a whole 
adequately, in my view. 
  Third. What is the constructive part of the document? I will 
not deny that there are individual elements in it which deserve 
to be discussed, and possibly even realized. But as a whole, the 
spirit of these proposals seems unacceptable to me. And not 
because it may seem that I am ideologically inclined in favor of 
one alternative as opposed to another. No, there is a different 
reason: either the measures proposed will not produce the 
results expected and will lead to negative consequences that are 
even more serious, or they simply do not take the actual 
situation into account and cannot be implemented. 
  I will not make unsubstantiated statements. I will cite a 
few 
examples. One of the program's key features is the proposal on 
price controls. Meanwhile, it is being implemented. Prices for 
energy and energy resources are partly controlled, and the 
tariffs in transportation and municipal services are partly 
controlled. The document gives particular emphasis to the need 
to freeze prices for energy resources. 
  I should say the following in this connection. The process 
of 
shaping a market economy is now taking place independently, 
without regard for the wishes of the government, the Academy of 
Sciences, or anyone else. It is linked with the establishment of 
new relative prices and new price ratios. And they are being 
shaped in spite of all types of obstacles stemming from the 
structure of our economy. The analysis which we conducted last 
autumn states: where there is no interference from price 
controls, the process of moving them closer to world prices is 
under way. 
  On the whole, a very positive process. Unfortunately, 
however, it it has its unfavorable aspects, because enterprises 
are beginning to feel that while they had a comfortable life 
last year and all the price correlations, outlays for production 
and technologies, and so forth were balanced, they are now being 
upset. However, if these upsets had not taken place, there would 
have been no incentives for restructuring, either! 
  Practically all our enterprises felt the need to reduce 
costs 
for the first time at the end of 1993. And not because someone 
from the top ordered them to reduce production cost. This has 
now become a vitally necessary task for them. They must reduce 
costs or run to the government and ask it to increase excise 
taxes, particularly because foreign competition is becoming 
stronger. 
  The prices for energy and energy resources are the most 
urgent problem. Because the entire Russian economy has been 
adjusted to technologies which waste energy, those which consume 
vast amounts of energy. The gap between domestic prices and 
world prices for it in the starting period was greater than ever 
before. Our cost was 7 percent of the world cost of oil. 
  Now the ratios have changed. But we still have to come up to 
real price correlations, all the same. I can agree with what was 
stated in the report: this goal cannot be reached too quickly, 
instantly. However, liberalization of prices for energy 
resources is inevitable, and they should be controlled by 
domestic supply and demand. And so that there is some balance 
with world prices, we should introduce an energy tax or export 
duties and nothing else. 
  Of course, the proposal to freeze the prices for energy 
resources eases the situation for the processing industry, 
enabling it to remain in this uncertain position for some time: 
it may survive, but it cannot reach normalcy. At the same time, 
the fuel and power complex is in a very difficult situation. It 
is not receiving the appropriate incomes or the appropriate 
funds for investment. In the meantime, whether anyone likes it 
or not, it has a key role in the struggle for Russia's position 
in the world markets and to restore Russia's economy and 
competitiveness. It is precisely from the fuel and power complex 
that we can obtain specific funds to invest in other sectors and 
to support them, inasmuch as they will not be able to get up to 
the world level by themselves. Even the best sectors of our 
processing industry and the science-intensive sectors of the VPK 
[military industrial complex] require major support from the 
state for 3 to 5 years in order to come up to world standards 
and compete in world markets as an equal. 
  Where are we to obtain these funds? Our raw material, 
petroleum, and gas are the only competitive products. Clearly, 
we have to invest funds in this sector to obtain the resources 
needed. I share the view of the Academy of Sciences economists 
who say that we should take more from the fuel and power 
complex, because this is the only complex where a positive 
value-added is really being created in world prices. All the 
other sectors are producing a negative value-added. 
  In theory this is absolutely correct, but in practice the 
situation today is such that the extraction of raw material is 
falling and oil production is falling, and huge investments are 
needed; in addition to this, prices in the world market are 
dropping disastrously. Our price for a metric ton of oil is now 
41,000 rubles [R], but the world price was R120,000 not long 
ago. Think of it, we had 30 percent of the world value at one 
point. Now it has dropped to 80,000! For this reason, it is 
vitally important for us that the TEK [fuel and power complex] 
stand on its own feet. This is why I believe that freezing 
prices for energy resources is essentially a conservative idea. 
I do not think we can follow this path. Some control is 
possible, but not so that it interferes with the process of 
shaping the new relative prices. 
  The program states that the process under way is making the 
structure of the Russian economy heavier, while structural 
reorganization is moving in exactly the opposite direction. Can 
we avoid this or not? Let us assume we were now undertaking, in 
conformity with the canons and our way of thinking in the 
1970's, to restructure the production structure this way: by 
giving more to the consumer sector, less to the extractive 
industry, and more to machinebuilding, as in the years of 
acceleration. Is this correct? I have serious doubts about this. 
  The consumer sector. In itself it is not needed, but it has 
been called upon to provide the public with inexpensive, 
high-quality commodities. But very often the imported products 
turn out to be better than the domestic ones and more preferable 
for the consumer. I do not know what kind of sector will survive 
in the consumer sector, but there is simply no sense in 
protecting everything in succession. For this reason, the thesis 
about making the economy heavier, as a reproach and indication 
that some problem is increasing, is really unconvincing. It 
seems to me this reflects the ideology of the 1970's, when we 
assumed that perestroyka would take place within a closed 
Russian economy. 
  But now we do not even know exactly those strong aspects 
which will make their appearance, and how the structure of the 
Russian economy will take shape. Moreover, very positive 
structural shifts in the country are clearly apparent. Trade and 
the banking and monetary sectors are developing rapidly. 
  Not everyone likes this. In this case we say that everything 
is going into middleman operations, but we need real production. 
From the viewpoint of Marxist theory, this is correct, perhaps. 
However, trade and banking also produce a gross domestic 
product, generally speaking. And if capital has been channeled 
here now, it means it is more profitable to put it here. 
<H5>  [11 Feb p 7] </H5>
  [Text] Let us remember what the Russian economy suffers 
from the most and what it needs to increase its effectiveness. 
Trade and banking. This is precisely where the mechanism to 
regulate market relationships is being shaped, where we will be 
prompted to direct our money, how prices will be formed, and so 
forth. For this reason, simply to condemn intermediary 
operations means to ignore the very progressive structural 
shifts which are taking place in Russia, regardless of what we 
wish to happen. They are taking place precisely because its 
economy has turned out to be liberalized and open to a 
substantial degree. 
  Let us turn to another thesis in the program, which states 
that we should control prices and why we cannot make the 
transition to a market economy like all the other countries. The 
reason is indicated: the excessive monopolism of the Russian 
economy. It is really extensive. But in a closed economy it 
looks simply colossal. Incidentally, I was one of the first to 
study monopolism in Russia in the 1986-1987 period. And I am 
very careful how I treat this opinion now. 
  I will explain why. Monopolism in the Russian economy has 
undergone quite extensive transformations, to which few persons 
devote any attention, for some reason. Many monopolies which 
seemed to be particularly dangerous ceased to appear that way 
with the opening of the economy. Moreover, they turned out to be 
more vulnerable than other enterprises and other sectors. 
  Here is one of the examples. AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive 
Plant] 
is obviously a monopolist enterprise. But today it is running to 
the government, asking for higher tariffs on imported motor 
vehicles. The ZIL [Automotive Plant imeni Likhachev] is doing 
the same thing. Many of our other major plants have rushed to 
the center: rescue us quickly. because our products are not 
competitive and our costs are excessively high. In other words, 
they felt the competition. 
  This is what the opening of an economy means. Meanwhile, the 
economists argued: can it have a substantial effect on the 
status of the domestic market of a vast country such as Russia, 
with a low proportion of imports in domestic consumption, and 
the like? In my view, it has now become clear that opening of 
the economy is exerting a revolutionizing influence on the 
condition of the domestic market, on competition, and so forth 
which is much stronger than could have been expected. 
  Does this mean that monopolism is not a problem? Of course, 
it is. But only now its solution requires not general 
theoretical academic debates, but a more specific and active 
analysis. The monopolism which exists in the rayon around a 
dairy plant or a meat combine, or a trade and distribution 
network, is much more important than the monopolism which we see 
at the level of industrial giants. From this point of view I may 
argue with A. Chubays, let us say, that all the statements 
against financial-industrial groups or large holding companies 
are not always well-grounded. If foreign competition is really a 
factor, their influence does not turn out to be so strong. 
  But of course, these groups will enjoy greater influence 
within the country than the foreign competitors. And there is 
unquestionably a certain danger here. But in the document under 
discussion, this matter is discussed in a very general way and 
the following verdict is handed down: we have monopolism, and 
for this reason we should control prices, although the latter 
does not completely follow from the former. In fact, it is 
important see where monopolism is particularly substantial now. 
If we are referring to power companies which raise the rates for 
electricity, let us say, there is monopolism here and we must 
combat it. Because we cannot replace energy with a foreign 
product. At the same time, the regional power commissions are 
misusing their position: they set the rates lower for their 
customers and higher for other regions. And it is necessary to 
control prices for a period of time. The same thing applies to 
railroad tariffs. We cannot overcome the monopoly here, and no 
one in the foreign market will replace it. 
  It is another matter when we are talking about milk and 
meat, 
let us say. But don't we freeze bottling? We have to follow a 
more difficult, but more reliable route, which consists of 
establishing alternative ways to bring a product created on 
sovkhozes and kolkhozes, let us say, to the consumer and giving 
them the opportunity to build small processing plants, and so 
forth. This is the kind of work which is being conducted at the 
microlevel and does not require significant state intervention. 
So it is necessary to control prices in the exceptional cases 
when a monopolist becomes too bold, and so forth. There are laws 
for this as well. But there should not be price controls on a 
broad scale in any case. 
  There is one more thesis in the program--on support for 
certain sectors of industry with state orders. When proposals of 
this kind are made, the question arises right away: how do we do 
this? I am not opposed to it. Let us assume that an enterprise 
needs more time to accumulate investments and many other things 
in order to adapt to a new situation. How can this be done, how 
can the process be extended, and what opportunities exist for 
this? In principle, can this problem be resolved? 
  Let us assume that we have resorted to the help of state 
orders. Then whom do we give the obligatory orders to and at a 
low price? After all, an enterprise may refuse to fulfill it, 
since most of them are not state enterprises. Moreover, there is 
a law in accordance with which making it obligatory for an 
enterprise to accept such orders is prohibited. But even if it 
agrees, it will say: give me inexpensive materials as well. And 
then we return to the distribution system which we had before. 
What for? To make the shift to the market easier? To restore the 
planning system? This is more than astonishing. 
  There is another approach. Let us follow the market route. 
And establishing state orders means they must be paid for at 
market prices from the state budget. The newspapers are writing 
here that the government is allocating R14 trillion to purchase 
agricultural products. Let us assume that the agrarian lobby 
shook out an order from the government without the hope that the 
products purchased would be sold at the same prices at which the 
state acquired them. But after all, there are other sectors of 
the economy, the military industrial complex, for example. 
Should it be given an order too? The program did not state which 
sectors should be rescued with the help of state orders and 
where the money is to be obtained. 
  I heard an unpleasant report the other day: our level of tax 
collection is declining at a catastrophic rate, and the 
proportion of taxes in the VVP [gross domestic product] as of 
January this year decreased to almost one-third as much in a 
year's time. I ask: Can academicians permit themselves to 
approach the state budget so thoughtlessly, without the 
appropriate accounting, without evaluations, without weighing 
the actual opportunities seriously? After all, they must bear 
responsibility for what is stated in the document. 
  In my opinion, if the state does not have the money, it 
should reduce all kinds of purchases, namely those expenses 
which are least efficient. I would prefer, in following the 
recommendations of the program's authors, to spend more money on 
investments, especially the ones that are most effective, and on 
a reliable choice of projects. And this means it must be done 
jointly with private companies, with private capital, with banks 
and the like. The document says practically nothing about this. 
  Regrettably, I must come to the conclusion that this is a 
very poorly grounded proposal which is unlikely to be applied in 
practice. If the government considered it possible to adopt 
these proposals as they advise, it ought to reject them very 
quickly, because it does not have the opportunity to realize 
them. 
  Now about the agreements on prices and incomes. This idea is 
being championed by Yevgeniy Saburov. And I am also inclined to 
support it. This is a very popular theme now, generally 
speaking. And even Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, in speaking 
about the application of nonmonetarist methods, seemed to refer 
to the possibility that there there will be such agreements. 
  A positive case of a similar agreement may be cited: coal 
miners in the Kuzbass and transport workers agreed that 
transportation tariffs would be lowered for the coal being 
exported, in exchange for which the coal miners would share 
their foreign currency earnings with the transport workers. It 
would be good if measures such as these are multiplied. But I 
fear that on the whole, this is a completely unrealistic 
proposal as a phenomenon on a wide scale. 
  First of all, we are referring to agreements between 
producers and consumers, who naturally have different interests. 
Moreover, both sides are poorly organized. They say that our 
Russian economy is corporate in nature owing to the ministries 
and horizontal integration. For this reason, they say, all the 
enterprises know each other and can easily come to an agreement 
with each other. They are not reaching agreement well at 
present. But if we come to the level of a trilateral commission, 
where negotiations are conducted on incomes, prices, and other 
matters (I mean trade unions, businessmen, and the government), 
it will turn out that these persons do not enjoy prestige among 
those they have undertaken to represent. For this reason, the 
decisions adopted at the level of this trilateral commission 
will not be considered obligatory by anyone below it. 
  So we are not prepared to realize this idea yet. In our 
domestic market, representatives are not inclined to consolidate 
and uphold their interests together at the state level. There is 
only competition among them at present. Each one is fighting for 
his own piece, for himself. For this reason, I do not believe 
that such agreements will become an effective tool of the market 
soon. 
  But if this is true, the government has no other alternative 
left to hold back inflation except a strict monetary policy. 
They call it monetarism. But this is normal financial discipline 
which is the norm in economic life, and until such discipline 
exists, there can be no discussion about any kind of market 
economy. 
  I would agree with authors of the report which state that 
elimination of the budget deficit cannot become the meaning of 
life and that domestic industry cannot be strangled for the sake 
of it. I would agree with them if this deficit were not as 
large: it is actually more than 10 percent. If we put together 
all the proposals by ministries and departments on expenditures 
now, the deficit would be over 16 percent. That is a catastrophe. 
  Who can proceed to do this, what kind of government, even if 
it is the most protectionist one? Let the academicians speak 
with the directors about what is impeding them the most. They 
say: we are being impeded primarily by the high taxes. But when 
you begin to touch upon the essence of the processes taking 
place, it turns out that inflation interferes with them most of 
all. Because while they have earned a certain amount of money, 
it is quickly devalued. They have to invest in working capital 
all the time. There is not enough money, and then the directors 
begin saying: they collect the taxes, they say, and credit is 
expensive... Correct, but the only means of doing away with all 
these ailments is by beating inflation. 
  This is why I believe it is not at all correct to resort to 
the false pathos of the slogan: down with monetarism as a 
foreign invention which is harmful to the Russian soul. We are 
referring not to monetarism, but elementary financial discipline 
and realization that the printing press ccannot be the source of 
the country's welfare. I believe the program's authors are well 
aware of this.

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Vasilchuk, FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA: "For </F>
the Time Being the Fantasies of New Programs Are Far From 
Reality"] 
  [Text] The report by the Department of Economics of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences and of the "Reforma" [Reform] Fund 
(the Abalkin-Petrakov-Shatalin report) was received very coolly 
in Russian "upper circles." Economics Minister A. Shokhin called 
the proposals by the three academicians too general. 
Presidential expert analysts noted their conservatism. 
  Indeed, such provisions of the academic program as the 
rejection of voucher privatization and the strengthening of 
state regulation of price formation simply do not correspond to 
the real economic relations presently existing in Russia. The 
"sweepingness" of the measures proposed in the area of 
structural policy, essentially, requires the restoration of 
administrative-command levers of economic management. 
  The report-program of "real economic reforms" by a group of 
specialists of the Central Economic and Mathematical Institute, 
which was submitted to the government by S. Glazyev, chairman of 
the Committee on Economic Policy of the State Duma, was received 
much more favorably. A. Shokhin even said that the proposals in 
Glazyev's report were in the channel of the economic concept 
ripening within the government itself. 
  As compared with the program by the "three academicians," 
the 
approaches in Glazyev's report seem more progressive. The 
achievement of the structure of world prices with a moderately 
liberal utilization of the classic tools of state regulation of 
the market economy, that is, tax, customs, antimonopoly policy, 
and so forth, is anticipated. In the opinion of the authors of 
this report, together with an active organizational and 
industrial policy and the creation of powerful financial and 
industrial groups this will make it possible to optimize costs 
on the scale of the entire national economic complex and to 
concentrate investment resources at promising technological 
growth points. The document acknowledges the importance of 
social transfers and of psychological support for the spirit of 
entrepreneurship and innovation, as well as the need to create 
an equality of information opportunities. 
  In the final analysis, the program of the Lvov-Glazyev group 
represents a certain intricate methodological hybrid. On the one 
hand, ideas close to competitive equilibrium trends in economic 
theory prevail in macroeconomic sections. On the other hand, the 
mechanism of recovery from the crisis is based on dynamic models 
of "transformation growth," that is, with an emphasis on 
technological innovations and entrepreneurial enthusiasm. 
  Conceptually, the mixture of the Central Economic and 
Mathematical Institute seems not bad. In the end a moderate dose 
of theoretical eclecticism is inevitable and even necessary in 
economic program research and development. The vector of 
historical optimism in Glazyev's report is also directed 
forward, which distinguishes it advantageously from traditional 
academic conservatism "looking back at yesterday." The formation 
of powerful financial and industrial groups has the right to 
life both in theory and in practical policy, provided it occurs 
as an objectively necessary process--regulated within the 
framework of antimonopoly legislation--of concentration and 
centralization of national financial capital and does not force 
its way from above as an end-in-itself project of the currently 
fashionable economic doctrine. 
  However, neither the report itself nor the numerous alarmist 
statements by its principal elaborators contain the chief 
thing--a set of strictly practical recommendations, the 
implementation of which would enable the government, in the next 
one and a half to two years, to keep the economy under control 
and "to hold out" until the mechanism of investment resource 
conservation and of the "technological" multiplicator begins to 
operate. 
  Under the slogan of advancement toward world price 
proportions, in fact, the report evades the most acute problem 
of a current--immediate--efficient integration of Russia's 
disproportional economy and of the world economy. The inflation 
of sellers and the noncompetitiveness of the domestic industry, 
alas, are not a myth. Otherwise, the government's protectionist 
lobbying would not be so strong. 
  In contrast to the Abalkin-Petrakov-Shatalin program, which 
expects to actuate a state-controlled price mechanism of 
redistribution of income from competitive export sectors in 
favor of the inefficient area of the economy, the research and 
development of the Central Economic and Mathematical Institute 
propose that tax levers be used and that the rent from natural 
resources be made the determining basis for the tax system. 
Thus, in the opinion of the authors of this report, from one oil 
and gas complex it is possible "to extract" 30 billion dollars 
of income annually! At the same time, how and from what 
investment sources the latter should develop large-scale 
production involving the initial processing of fuel-power and 
raw material resources before 1995 remains only a guess. 
  Both reports allot a special place to the credit and 
monetary 
system, the banking sector, and currency regulation. In many 
cases reproaches directed against the credit and financial 
sphere must be considered justified. Almost all sectors of the 
economy and society at large have a tremendous grudge against 
the banking sector and the country's credit and financial system 
(including state finances). 
  Therefore, the recommendations to toughen bank control and 
currency regulation are politically explicable. Economically, 
however, they are poorly justified and their obvious 
"overdosage" and the new government's passion for administrative 
prescriptions can lead to opposite results.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Aspin: "The Ministry of Finance Has </F>
Reduced the Size of the Bond Issue"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Ministry of Finance had 
to reduce the size of the latest state short-term bond issue 
dramatically. According to an official report the Central Bank 
released yesterday on the new, 10th state short-term bond issue, 
the amount will be 100 billion rubles, or 30 billion less than 
the previous issue. Therefore, for the first time in the history 
of the short-term bond market, the Ministry of Finance has had 
to reduce the amount of the bond issue to below the amount of 
the previous issue. Besides this, yesterday's Central Bank 
report limited the portion of the total issue available to 
foreign investors. 
  The failure of the January primary state short-term bond 
auction, when the Ministry of Finance was able to float only 
three-fourths of the projected amount of the latest "portion" of 
the domestic debt, forced the country's main financial agency to 
take a more cautious approach in deciding the size of the 
anniversary bond issue, the 10th. For the first time in the 
history of the short-term bond market, the Ministry of Finance 
had to reduce the amount of the latest issue to below the 
previous figure, and the reduction was equivalent to 23 percent 
of the originally announced amount, which is extraordinary in 
itself. 
  Exports from KOMMERSANT-DAILY believe that the insubstantial 
results of the January auction were not the only reason for the 
Ministry of Finance's reduction of the bond issue. After taking 
a look at the results of the Central Bank's regular surveys of 
financial dealers, the organizers of the state short-term bond 
market apparently decided that the Ministry of Finance had lost 
the trust of many investors after the winter changes in the 
government and the probable dramatic adjustments of the reform 
policy. It is significant that the projected changes in the 
policy of economic reform were supposed to have been approved or 
rejected by the Council of Ministers at a meeting scheduled long 
ago for 17 February. Judging by the dynamics of key interest 
rates (particularly the current yield on Ministry of Finance 
short-term bonds and foreign securities), the market was clearly 
preparing for the worst. This means that next week the dealers 
are more likely to conduct operations in the foreign currency 
market than to invest in the Ministry of Finance's ruble bonds. 
If large dealers act on these intentions, it will be extremely 
difficult for the Ministry of Finance to float a debt of even 
100 billion rubles on 15 February, the date of the primary 
auction of the 10th issue of state short-term bonds. 

<FIG ID=FBIS-USR-021-56A>           Changes in Size of Short-Term </FIG>





    Experts from KOMMERSANT-DAILY believe that the slightest 
hint 
of any possible destabilization of the foreign currency market 
this week will discourage participation in the primary auction 
on 15 February because it will be inadvisable from the 
standpoint of short-term speculative profits. In this case, the 
Ministry of Finance probably can expect insufficient demand for 
the bonds, and this will immediately reduce the liquidity of the 
secondary bond market. 
  Besides this, yesterday's Central Bank press release set a 
limit of 10 percent of the total issue (10 billion rubles) for 
foreign investors. The Central Bank's technical move to regulate 
the market aroused the interest of the KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts: 
This is the first time that objective figures can be used as a 
basis to estimate the demand for short-term state bonds among 
foreign investors, because approximate estimates of the foreign 
interest in these bonds have been impossible up to this time.

<F P=106> [Commentary by KOMMERSANT-DAILY scientific editor Nikita </F>
Kirichenko: "The Deficit Has Exceeded Expectations"] 
  [Text] According to information received by the 
editorial staff, specialists in the Russian Government and the 
State Duma will begin next week to analyze the indicators 
prepared in the Federal Treasury on results of implementing the 
1993 budget. The document was sent to leading parliamentary 
committees yesterday. KOMMERSANT-DAILY's scientific editor, 
Nikita Kirichenko, comments on the results of implementing 
Russia's budget. 
  Just as KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts expected, the Ministry of 
Finance put together a budget which deviates substantially from 
the indicators set by legislation in July 1993. 
  Revenues of the federal budget were on the order of 17 
trillion rubles [R] with a shortfall of R7 trillion against the 
plan. Receipts from the NDS [value-added tax] (a shortfall of R2 
trillion), excise taxes (a R1.6 trillion shortfall), and incomes 
from foreign economic activity (a R2.1 trillion shortfall) 
"lagged behind" substantially. 
  Now about expenditures. Despite the fact that the Ministry 
of 
Finance indicated the figure of R34 trillion in its official 
record of the 1993 results, in order at the very least to blend 
with the maximum figures of the budget deficit designated in the 
Ministry of Finance-Council of Ministers statement No. 
1-10/2-204 of 18 October. Let us remind you that the statement 
said the budget deficit in 1993 may be "squeezed" to R17 
trillion as opposed to a possible R22 trillion as a result of 
the combination of measures being proposed by the Ministry of 
Finance. 
  However, the KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts are inclined to 
appraise the actual sum of budget expenditures in 1993 not at 
R34 trillion, but R42 trillion. As we have already written, the 
point is that liabilities in unsequestered expenditures from the 
1993 budget totaling R8 trillion were carried over to the 
beginning of 1994. Including debts to the Ministry of Defense 
(R1.2 trillion), to the APK [agroindustrial complex] for crop 
purchases last year and subsidies (R2.7 trillion), and to the 
construction complex for work already completed (R1.5 trillion). 
Now this fact has been acknowledged officially by members of the 
cabinet--by Aleksandr Shokhin, Sergey Dubinin, and Viktor 
Gerashchenko. 
  They managed to "turn over" this debt to some extent through 
a simple strategem--the money was sent to numerous budgetary 
enterprises in the last days and hours of 1993, and the 
enterprises were physically unable to pay ewmployees' wages in 
time. This created a serious problem for them, inasmuch as 
beginning on 1 January 1994, the budgeted money not taken out 
was automatically entered as unclaimed income for the 1994 
budget. It was claimed, naturally, but in 1994. After carrying 
over the old debts to the new year, the Ministry of Finance 
asked the TsB [Central Bank] for R7.5 trillion in credit for the 
first quarter of 1994. 
  But what will come out of all this? First of all, the real 
budget deficit in 1993 may be estimated at R25 trillion, or 15.4 
percent of the gross domestic product. (According to the latest 
data from the Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], the 
GNP in 1993 totaled R162.3 trillion.) 
  Secondly, credit for the budget in the first quarter of 
1994, 
asked for by taking into account the old debts, essentially 
exhausts the Central Bank limit for this period and completely 
deprives it of the opportunity to refinance the country's 
economy in the first quarter through the commercial banks. (Let 
us remind you that in 1993, the Ministry of Finance was ashamed 
to take more than 50-60 percent of the total sum of the Central 
Bank's credit investments for itself--the rest went to extend 
credit for the economy anyway.) 
  Thirdly, repayment of the old debts will inevitably turn 
into 
a powerful inflationary surge by the end of the first quarter.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Viktorov, Vladimir Yakhontov, and </F>
Svetlana Voronkova under the rubric "Draft Tax Reform 
Discussed": "Authorities May Change Budget Policy"] 
  [Text] 
  [begin box] 
  The main proposals for reform of the tax-budget system 
in Russia contained in the report "Basic Directions for the 
Formation of the Economic Policy" are: 
  --Transformation of rent payments into a decisive item of 
budget revenues. Collection of natural rent through the transfer 
of deposits for leasing for an indefinite period of time with 
the establishment of the lease payment in dollars, depending on 
the world price of the extracted product. The active use of rent 
for the utilization of land, especially in cities and suburban 
zones; 
  --Reduction of the number of taxes, fees, and payments 
through their unification or abolition. The establishment of 
standard normatives for the distribution of tax revenues amongst 
budgets at various levels. The establishment of automatic 
procedures (built into the bank settlement mechanism) for 
collecting taxes to replace declarative ones; 
  --Replacement of progressive income tax systems with 
proportional ones with the simultaneous introduction of tax on 
the property of legal entities and individuals, a 50-percent tax 
for exporting capital, and taxes on operations involving real 
estate and securities (3 percent of the value of the 
transaction); 
  --Replacement of income and profit tax with a consumption 
tax 
to be paid by legal entities. The establishment of a standard 
rate of value added tax in the amount of 10 percent. [end box] 
  A radical change in the tax-budget strategy of the Russian 
authorities is becoming increasingly probable. Having discovered 
the ineffectiveness of the utilization of the existing tax 
system to resolve the budget crisis, leaders of both federal and 
local governments do not rule out the possibility, in a certain 
stage, of resorting to a reduction of traditional taxes and 
making rent payments the main source of budget revenues. This is 
shown by the attention paid by specialists of the Government of 
Russia and also the Governments of Moscow and St. Petersburg to 
proposals contained in the report received yesterday from 
experts of the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute, 
"Basic Directions for the Formation of the Economic Policy." The 
thrust of the report is to rely on rent payments for 
replenishing the state budget. It is significant that among the 
authors of the report is the chairman of one of the key 
parliamentary committees, the Committee of the State Duma on 
Economic Policy--Sergey Glazyev. The prospects of legislative 
support for these ideas make it crucial to analyze the 
possibilities of such an adjustment to the economic policy. 
<H3>  Russian Authorities in Search of Budget Revenues: Reliance 
on Rent Payments </H3>
  The attempts on the part of Russian authorities and academic 
circles to find some nontraditional sources for radically 
increasing budget revenues are quite natural. Surmounting the 
crisis of state finances is officially considered to be almost 
the main objective of the economic reforms in Russia. It is 
especially significant that this is insisted upon by 
international financial circles, which proceed from the idea 
that without improvement in its financial system Russia will 
hardly be able to surmount the economic crisis and resolve the 
problem of its foreign indebtedness. It is significant that at 
the present time in the Russian economic policy methods of 
achieving financial stability through reducing budget 
expenditures are losing popularity--since the reduction of 
budget aid to key branches in the social sphere, as has become 
obvious, leads to an extremely significant increase in 
sociopolitical tension. 
  Therefore main attention is drawn to an idea that has gained 
popularity recently, which is that it is possible to resolve the 
problem of increasing budget revenues rapidly and radically by 
relying not only and not so much on traditional taxes (value 
added tax, income tax, profit tax) as on rent payments for the 
use of state mineral deposits and agricultural land. In 
particular, this is the idea contained in the recently published 
report prepared by the Central Economics and Mathematics 
Institute entitled "Basic Directions for the Formation of 
Economic Policy." It is noteworthy that one of the authors of 
this report is the chairman of the parliamentary committee on 
economic policy, Sergey Glazyev. Thus it cannot be ruled out 
that in the foreseeable future such an idea will be the official 
"contribution" from parliament to the adjustment of the federal 
economic policy. Moreover, sympathies for this method of 
replenishing the budget are not concealed by influential figures 
in local organs of power either--especially in the Moscow and 
St. Petersburg Governments. For example, the December directive 
from the mayor of Moscow contains an instruction to the 
Department of Economics to prepare a proposal for increasing 
land tax and reducing other taxes. The obvious merits of this 
idea contribute a great deal to its popularity. Since the 
government up to this point essentially retains ownership of 
natural resources, it would be natural to make maximum use of 
them for replenishing state finances. In essence, this is being 
done already to a certain degree--for example, existing excise 
taxes on the extraction of oil, in spite of their name, are 
nothing other than differential rent. 
  To be sure, such a path to surmounting the financial crisis 
has one essential shortcoming--it is clearly based on 
preservation of the state monopoly on natural resources, 
particularly the land. And many Western experts, insisting on 
budget stabilization as a necessary component of market reforms, 
reject the idea of a state monopoly on natural resources. 
Particularly the prominent Harvard professor Jeffrey Sachs, who 
recently left the post of adviser to the Russian parliament, 
asserted that land rent cannot be the main source for 
replenishing the budget, and he considers privatization of the 
land to be the most important and urgent problem. But recently 
it has been increasingly popular in Western financial and 
industrial circles to think that rejection of the state monopoly 
on natural resources in Russia is not mandatory--in particular, 
many Western investors are completely prepared to limit 
themselves to obtaining land and mineral deposits under a 
long-term lease. Thus it is quite probable that the idea of 
budget stabilization and financing of the development of 
Russia's economy through rent payments will not evoke 
fundamental objections in the West. The more so since initially 
such an idea appeared precisely in Western economic theory. 
<H3>  World Theory and Practice of the Utilization of Rent 
Payments in State Finances </H3>
  The diversity of rent theories does not change its essence. 
When speaking of rent one is usually referring to the added 
profit that is received by the owners of an especially 
productive resource as compared to their competitors, who have 
resources with less productivity (the added profit is received 
simply because certain producers have considerably lower 
production outlays than their competitors and sell their goods 
in a competitive economy at the same prices). The most typical 
source of rent in productions involving natural resources is 
from agriculture or the extraction industry. This is natural 
since natural resources essentially cannot be created by man and 
so they are limited--therefore the difference, for example, in 
the fertility of the soil or the productivity of deposits is 
relatively constant. 
  The fact that the owner of particularly fertile land 
receives 
a certain profit whose source is "nature" has quite naturally 
attracted the attention of economists almost since the origin of 
economic theory. It was quite tempting to declare the 
appropriation of such a gift of nature by one person to be 
unfair to a certain degree. Therefore when searching for sources 
of state financing, it was extremely popular among economists to 
demand that rent be paid into state revenues--with a 
simultaneous reduction of taxes, which in any country have 
caused dissatisfaction among entrepreneurs and the population. 
Theories based on such a change in budget policy are fairly 
diverse. Some suggest abolishing all taxes and leaving only a 
high tax on the land (Henry George), while others suggest 
introducing differentiated tax separately for buildings and 
separately for the plot of land, leaving the basic tax burden on 
the land (Nicholas Tiedeman, Stephen B. Cord), while still 
others (Fred Harrison, Francis Smith) want to change the entire 
structure of the tax policy by increasing the tax on land and 
reducing other taxes (income tax, profit tax, value added tax). 
  The initiator of the idea of financing the budget through 
rent alone with complete abolition of all other taxes was the 
American economist Henry George, who back at the end of the last 
century stated: "To abolish taxes which, by acting and 
counteracting, now slow up every wheel of exchange and oppress 
all kinds of industry, would mean to shift an immense load from 
this mighty source...if somebody is building a ship we force him 
to pay for this audacity as if he had done harm to the state; if 
a factory is built we impose on it an annual tax which would be 
more than enough for a decent income...." Such a theory has 
adherents at the present time as well. According to calculations 
of the London Association of Scientific Research in the Area of 
Economic and Social Sciences, in the majority of developed 
countries land rent makes up about 40 percent of the national 
income, and the rents would be quite enough for the governments 
to cover state expenditures. But not all economists are so 
radical. Nicholas Tiedeman and Stephen B. Cord limit themselves 
to this tax policy on the scale of individual cities. But they 
make analogous proposals--to leave only tax on land for 
financing local budgets. It is suggested that the amount of this 
tax be determined by regularly offering the right to use 
sections of it at auctions. 
  Concretizing the use of rent payments for financing the 
budget, a number of researchers, particularly Stephen B. Cord, 
suggest rejecting the existing system whereby taxes on land and 
real estate are the same and sharply increasing the tax on land, 
while reducing property tax on buildings (which, in his opinion, 
will provide an impetus for new construction). This theory was 
applied, in particular, in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania, United 
States) where, beginning in 1979, the tax rate for land was 
almost doubled but the amount of the tax on buildings remained 
the same. The tax rate for land was 9.75 percent, and 
buildings--2.45 percent. (Since that time they have changed 
periodically, and today they are 15.15 percent for land and 2.7 
percent for buildings.) As a result, during 1980-1984 the volume 
of new construction in Pittsburgh increased 5.9-fold as compared 
to the period of 1974-78 (according to figures from the Bureau 
of Construction Inspections). And in the United States as a 
whole the volume of new construction has increased only 1.6-fold 
during that time. 
  But, in spite of the fact that in theory reorienting the 
state budget completely to rent payments produces appreciable 
advantages, large-scale practical introduction of such a plan 
would naturally be extremely difficult. A special role here is 
played by the active resistance of the landowner lobbies, which 
are traditionally quite strong in practically all industrial 
countries. 
<H5>  Prospects for Reorientation of Budget Policy to Rent Payments </H5>
  On the whole one can say that the concept of augmenting 
state 
finances through the use of rents and real estate taxes 
completely corresponds to the interests of the Russian 
authorities. At both the federal and the local levels the 
authorities are interested in demonstrating a desire to reduce 
taxes on profit and income "in order to stimulate national 
industry and entrepreneurial activity." It is essential that the 
authorities will be able to count on more stable revenues from 
rent, lease payments, and real estate tax than from other taxes, 
the more so since profit and incomes, as practice shows, are 
easier to conceal from taxation than are land and real estate. 
Moreover, as the report from the Central Economics and 
Mathematics Institute shows, the authorities might consider it 
preferable to calculate rent payments--particularly when leasing 
mineral deposits--directly in hard currency. This too could 
stabilize budget revenues under conditions of inflation. 
According to the report, the most reasonable method is 
considered to be leasing mineral deposits for an indefinite 
period with the collection of the lease payment in dollars. The 
amount of the payment should be established depending on the 
world price of the product extracted. According to calculations 
of the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute, for rents 
for products of the petroleum and gas complex alone, when 
calculated in world prices, the budget would receive about $30 
billion annually. 
  In order not to evoke a counteraction from the "petroleum 
and 
gas lobby," the authorities might very well try to use another 
formula that was proposed in the report--sharply reduce all 
taxes on leasing enterprises and guarantee that in any case the 
enterprises will be left with enough profit to cover the needs 
for the development of the complex itself. Of course, mass 
support from local authorities for such an idea will depend 
largely on how the rent payments are divided between the local 
and federal budgets. Incidentally, the interest of local 
authorities in radically changing the tax policy certainly does 
not mean that this can be done quickly from a purely technical 
viewpoint. 
<H5>  Tax Reform in Russia: The Opinion of Tax Organs </H5>
  As one might expect, specialists of tax organs, who are 
traditionally cautious about innovations, are fairly skeptical 
about the reform. In their words, to conduct a tax reform in 
Russia in the near future with a shift of the main burden from 
income taxes to land payments is not very likely. The main 
argument against changing the structural foundations of the tax 
system is the technical impossibility of correct calculation of 
both the real value of the land and the effectiveness of 
conducting such a reform from the standpoint of budget revenues. 
  The impossibility of calculating the value of the land, in 
the opinion of tax organ specialists, is conditioned by the fact 
that there is no liquid land market in Russia today. Therefore 
there is no possibility of determining the price of "similar" 
plots put up for auction. The institution of real estate 
appraisers as such (and especially land appraisers) is only in 
its initial stage of development. All this will also lead to a 
situation where it will be practically impossible to calculate 
the effectiveness of the land tax, since there is no basis for 
calculation. 
  Even if approximate calculations are done and they show that 
shifting the tax burden to large land holders is attractive for 
the budget, this certainly does not mean that everything will 
turn out that way in reality. The reason is that, as practice 
shows, replacing typical laws with less familiar ones without 
the preliminary practice of "breaking them in" leads to a 
reduction of revenues into the state budget. The taxpayers (and 
fiscal echelons as well) are simply not in a condition to 
correctly calculate the sums due to the budget. Moreover, the 
normative documents that introduce the new taxes might contain 
(or might not contain) a considerable number of "loopholes" 
which allow the leakage of a considerable amount of money on 
which the budget could count. Such a situation developed, for 
example, when the former turnover tax was replaced by the value 
added tax. A means of evading taxation by using false fines, 
which seems obvious today, was closed off only two years after 
the introduction of the law on value added tax. It is probable 
that this is why one of the highly placed workers in the 
Ministry of Finance, commenting at the request of the KOMMERSANT 
editors, on the proposals for the tax reform, worded his opinion 
fairly emotionally: "Under today's conditions only an enemy 
could suggest such a thing!" 
  And so the only thing that can be expected from the 
increasing popularity of the theory of land payments as the 
basis of public well-being is the conducting of experiments in 
cities that are most susceptible to new trends: Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, and Nizhnyy Novgorod. They will most likely consist 
in considerably raising the rates of the existing land tax, 
which will require additional decisions at the level of federal 
authorities since a limit on raising these rates has now been 
established. And there is no guarantee that this will occur 
along with any significant reduction of taxes on profit and 
income.

  [Text] As of the first of February, indexation of 
Russian citizens' personal savings has begun: savings deposits 
have increased threefold since 1 January 1992. However, the old 
familiar lines outside savings banks made up of people anxious 
to be personally convinced that their account was properly 
indexed are no more. 
  The general indifference is not surprising. Three years ago 
a 
pensioner who had accumulated a thousand rubles in his passbook 
felt reassured. He knew he had enough money for several months 
of normal existence or, God forbid, for a decent funeral. Today, 
the same deposit, even threefold, would barely get him an extra 
bottle of vodka, and not even one from the famous Kristall 
factory. 
  In previous, pre-reform years, each person who had even a 
few 
rubles in his savings passbook became a creditor of the state 
and its economy. There was a time when citizens' savings 
equalled 80 percent of the domestic national product. The state 
used this huge sum of money freely, boldly, and carelessly to 
extend credit to industry and agriculture. 
  At first glance, we were being robbed openly and impudently; 
no other country in the world would have paid such a tiny rate 
of interest on deposits. Only now does one realize that in many 
ways the uncontrolled utilization of our money made it possible 
for prices for most consumer goods to be kept virtually 
unchanged for many long years. 
  In January 1992, price liberalization came crashing in. 
Worker savings quickly evaporated. It was the lightning robbery 
of millions of law-abiding citizens. 
  This event predetermined both the enormous losses for the 
economy and the impossibility of establishing social peace and 
calm in the country for many years to come, above all because 
people lost faith in the state and the course toward 
democratization and reforms, to which millions upon millions 
linked their impoverishment. The state itself, deprived of huge 
free credits, began to search for other sources that would keep 
the economy functioning at least minimally. Since the former 
billions were no longer on deposit, the state was forced to 
resort to unrestrained credit emission. 
  Today many specialists feel that high rates of inflation, 
rising prices, and the impoverishment of millions are the 
consequence not so much of price liberalization as of the 
unrestricted credit emissions they are attempting to use to 
replace the old "private" credit. 
  Right now the chairman of the government and the vice 
premier 
talk about the need to repay their indebtedness to certain 
branches of the economy, to supporting their preferential loans. 
They are talking about 5-6 trillion rubles [R] already in the 
first quarter of this year. Obviously those trillions are not in 
the state treasury. If they are to give them out to miners, oil 
workers, defense workers, and agriculture, money will have to be 
printed, plain and simple. Monetary emission that is not 
reinforced by a growth in production and services, however, is 
the direct route to accelerated inflation and price increases, 
to poverty for some and excessive wealth for others. 
  Let us ask ourselves a question, though. Is our state truly 
so poor, is it so catastrophically short of money? The state, 
that is the government, the Central Bank, and the Ministry of 
Finance, may not have money. But you and I have "free" money. 
Quite a lot of it. You don't believe it? 
  Goskomstat (State Committee for Statistics) publishes a 
survey, The Socio-Economic Status of the Russian Federation. In 
issue 11, in a chapter entitled "Standard of Living," on page 
61, highly eloquent figures are published confirming what is at 
first glance a debatable assertion about the unprecedented 
wealth you and I possess. Between January and November of last 
year the population held cash used to purchase hard currency and 
bank deposits that amounted to nearly 22 percent of all income 
received. Is that a lot or a little? Let us calculate: according 
to the same survey, the population's income for those 11 months 
totaled R42.2 trillion. This means that the free money--that is, 
the cash in our pockets, hard currency acquired, and bank 
deposits--for you and me came to about R9 trillion. 
  We can assume that in three months the population 
accumulates 
more than R10 trillion in free funds. If the government had the 
opportunity to utilize some of this money, to put it into 
economic circulation, there would not be such a need for 
emission, preferential credits, inflation, and further price 
increases. 
  All that remains for us is to bring it to the savings banks 
and place it in our personal accounts. Why aren't we doing that? 
Why do we prefer to buy hard currency and securities, to make 
deposits in commercial bank deposit accounts? 
  For one simple reason. Hard currency and commercial banks 
protect our money better from inflation. In order to be 
convinced of this, a simple calculation will suffice. Last year, 
the value of the dollar rose threefold. This means, the sum 
which someone at the beginning of the year put into the purchase 
of "greenbacks" grew by that much. This, of course, is not full 
compensation for the devaluation of money, but it is still at 
least some protection. The exact same effect could be derived in 
a bank account, given a 200-percent rate of interest. As we 
know, savings banks are not offering their depositors these 
kinds of conditions. Commercial banks, though, are taking money 
from the population at 300-350 percent. 
  Unfortunately, neither deposits in commercial banks nor the 
purchase of hard cash can have as restorative an effect on the 
economy as "private" credit. Last year, 95-97 percent of all 
loans made by commercial banks were short-term loans for no more 
than three months. Normal goods production requires loans for at 
least half a year. 
  The hard cash, the billions of dollars acquired by the 
population at exchange points, cannot work either because they 
lie like a dead weight in citizens' apartments or in the 
accounts of those same commercial banks. 
  So there is much more free money in the country than before, 
but for the government, the economy, and society as a whole, it 
is useless. 
  Is it possible to put those R9-10 trillion that remain with 
the population in the first quarter to work? Undoubtedly. 
  For instance, it is worthwhile interesting commercial banks 
in long-term loan extensions for production. How? With the help 
of tax benefits or the transfer of property or real estate. 
Interest on savings bank deposits can be raised significantly. 
If rates exceed at least 200 percent, then many would prefer a 
savings bank to other financial structures. Despite all the 
upheavals and disappointments, many have retained their 
traditional trust in state guarantees. If the conditions for 
keeping money come even a little closer to what the commercials 
are promising, millions of people may again go to the savings 
banks. 
  Although voucher privatization is proceeding at a speedy 
rate, the state still retains a significant share of property. 
Here it is, especially after recalculating the value of basic 
funds: this could become a guarantee for the repayment of debts 
to tens of millions of citizens. 
  The state could transfer to the Savings Bank shares or debt 
obligations with right of sale at auction. The earnings would 
yield money for the fair compensation of deposits. Not by a 
pitiful and ridiculous factor of 3, threefold, but by a hefty 
and tangible factor of 50-70. This would return to the state its 
citizens' confidence and sympathy. 
  Confidence will return. No one will be afraid to give his 
money up, and the state will receive a powerful financial source 
for reforming the economy without emissions or inflation. This 
year the country's population is going to have approximately 
R35-40 trillion. The possibility of utilizing even half of this 
sum would mean the return of our hopes for the economy's 
stabilization. Isn't this prospect worth making a decision, 
after having thought it all over and weighed everything, that 
would satisfy tens of millions of people?

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Agapov, president of Kredo-Bank, by </F>
Andrey Zverev, chief of the economic department of the 
government staff, Doctor of Economic Sciences Gennadiy 
Lisichkin, and Mikhail Dmitriyev, financial consultant to 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, under the "The Professional" rubric; 
publication prepared by Irma Mamaladze; place and date not 
given: "Hugs and Kisses, or Shoves and Hisses: Pages From the 
Life of Kredo-Bank President Yuriy Agapov"] 
  [Text] They say that the time of the amateur has 
come. Our society has never before perceived the lack of 
professionalism, especially in politics and the governance of 
the country, so acutely. Part of the reason may be that, for the 
first time in many years, politics and governance are again 
becoming spheres for professional rather than party-sponsored 
activities. The longing for professionals expresses the 
deep-down yearning for stability: As a rule, professionals do 
not get carried away by radicalism. We decided to begin the 
discussion of professionalism by meeting with Yuriy Agapov, 
president of Kredo-Bank, because a person who has managed to put 
on its feet one of the most stable and respectable banks within 
a short period of time is definitely a professional. We invited 
to the meeting Andrey Zverev, chief of the economic department 
of the government staff; Doctor of Economic Sciences Gennadiy 
Lisichkin; and Mikhail Dmitriyev, financial consultant to 
OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. 
<H5>  1. Do Not Worry! We Love You.... </H5>
  [Interviewer] How did you start out? 
  [Interviewer] What does it mean to open a bank? 
  [Interviewer] Was there an element of chance in the decision 
you made? 
  [Agapov] I was born on 13 December 1958 in Belarus, in the 
small settlement of Ros. My father served in the Air Force. He 
got caught in the cutback of the military by Khrushchev, and he 
got what he got: a lathe till the end of his days. He worked in 
Moscow at a plant that was, incidentally, headed by Skokov--the 
Foton Plant. This is a small world. 
  I graduated from the finance institute. Later came graduate 
study and a dissertation. I tried to engage in science, but 
later, when I understood that this held absolutely no promise, I 
switched to the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth 
League]. I was a member of the city committee, got certain 
"ins," some connections, acquaintances. 
  In 1988, after a meeting between young people and Gorbachev, 
a once-in-a-lifetime random event occurred: I shook hands with 
him, and this picture ended up in newspapers. At this point, it 
was as if someone had lit a fire under me; I decided to do 
something of my own. 
  Actually, I took up the Komsomol in order to get ahead in 
life at least somewhat, too, because given the family I came 
from, I had no other career opportunity. 
  So in 1988 I burned all my bridges and embarked on a risky 
venture, because I did not have a kopek to my name, not a thing. 
However, I must have had quite powerful inner strength. As early 
as 27 March 1989, I got my bank registered. This was a bank that 
had neither money nor premises. If I could start everything 
over, I would never again get involved in this risky venture: 
this is how much dirt and filth I have gotten to see along the 
way. Most importantly, I have lost very many people whom I had 
considered close friends but who, having gotten access to 
enormous amounts of money, turned "swinish" right before my eyes. 
  There were two of us, my driver in the Zhiguli and I. Of 
course, it appears ridiculous now. Subsequently, I made the 
rounds of a few cooperatives, which had promised me 1.1 million 
rubles [R], but then for some reason refused to give me this 
money, just the way it happens. Later, some wise guy came along 
who decided to take this hollow bank away from me. There was a 
Russian-style, communal kitchen-style squabble. As a result, I 
borrowed R3,000 from friends (at the time, this was a lot of 
money), went to the cooperatives that had signed a contract with 
me, and said: Take this, and you do not have to pay it back, but 
send me a noncash transfer and resolve to admit new 
shareholders. This was an act of desperation, but things started 
moving. 
  Later, I met with Mikhail Aleksandrovich Bocharov. I latched 
onto this locomotive (to be sure, later it turned out to be a 
cart), and we prepared a Council of Ministers decree on an 
experiment in the Butek Concern. After the decree on the Butek 
Concern was issued on 25 January 1990, we were granted 
absolutely unlimited rights! It was altogether fantastic! At the 
time, I was very naive; it appeared to me that, since there was 
a decree signed by Ryzhkov, everybody would rush to carry it 
out. They laughed in my face: You had it signed? Now write your 
licenses yourself! 
  After two months of wandering from office to office in vain, 
I took a desperate step. I went to France to meet with Pierre 
Maurois, deputy mayor of the city of Lille. 
  OCCASIONAL REMARK: And here is an ace in the hole. 
  [Agapov] I knew a gentleman by the name of Jean Raymond de 
Greve. He was a duke, a real one. He turned out to be an aide to 
Pierre Maurois who helped me to obtain a permit from the Bank of 
France to open a correspondent account in France. 
  What followed was a like an episode from a good play. Leonid 
Ivanovich Abalkin gathered us in the Kremlin to review the 
results of carrying out the decree of the Council of Ministers. 
Everyone knew that this was spectacle, but.... My turn came. Why 
did you fail to obtain a license? Is Gerashchenko not here? 
Fine, we will postpone it. I said: What do you mean by postpone? 
I have to open accounts! Malinin from the Bank for Foreign Trade 
rose up and stated: There is nothing to discuss; this is a small 
bank, nobody has heard of it, nobody will open an account for 
it. So I produced the paper with the signature of Pierre Maurois 
and put it on Abalkin's desk. 
  At this point, Bocharov decided to have our wings clipped. 
He 
called me to see him at the Rossiya Hotel and said, in this kind 
of tragic voice: "I know everything about you. I know how many 
bribes you take, but do not worry, I will not turn you in. The 
only thing that I need from you is to bring in all client files 
and credit contracts to be looked over and for comradely advice 
to be given." I answered: "There is no problem! However, what 
you have just said is slander, so let us see a procurator and 
sort this out." 
  Further on, the full treatment began, and they began to drag 
in my employees to give testimony. By then, about 40 people 
worked for me, and the balance was pushing 50-60 million. One 
decent guy from among the employees came to me and wrote an 
official memorandum: Functionaries such and such summoned me to 
such and such a place, and asked me to tell them this and that. 
I took this paper and got in touch with Bakatin's service: "This 
is the situation. I am publishing an article on how you smother 
entrepreneur cadres." A very nice colonel came and said that 
nothing had happened--nobody has called anybody in to anywhere, 
do not worry, we love you.... They still love us: They keep 
digging; this is Russia, after all.... 
<H3>  2. Is There a Shareholder Who Does Not Know His Balance 
Sheet? </H3>
  [Interviewer] What did you mean by saying that you wanted to 
have a career? What is the meaning of career for you? What are 
your expectations in life? 
  [Interviewer] What are your current problems with the bank? 
Do you intend to convert to joint-stock operations? 
  [Agapov] A lot has changed since I first gave thought to a 
career. Most likely, I mean by career an interesting job in 
combination with a normal salary and social recognition. I never 
thought about wealth. I just did not know what it was. Later, I 
saw that career meant normal people talking to you, some 
currying favor with you, and some, of a high enough caliber, 
treating you as an equal. Of course, it is pleasant. However, 
this is not a career, but its reflection. This is what I think 
now. I know that many of my colleagues are just raking the money 
in. It is not difficult to get rich. What follows is currency 
conversion and transfer. Everything is legal, everything is 
normal; you can easily have all you want--and make tracks. 
  However, there is a problem. I have visited many countries, 
and I know there is nothing for me there. I am not needed there. 
I am nothing there. Here, I have work; here, I have people who 
are dear to me; they speak my language here; it is a pleasure 
for me to live here. I do not want to emigrate anywhere. If I do 
not want to emigrate, then why do I need a house in Vienna? Or 
in Spain? It is absurd in a way! Such a house needs to be 
maintained, and this kind of thing is quite expensive there. I 
believe that if the company that we have created prospers, we 
will be able to take a vacation wherever and whenever we want. 
If it does not prosper, then why have the rest? 
  Our locomotive has started moving, and I cannot stop it any 
longer. At present, we have approximately 30,000 clients, 28 
operating branches, a balance pushing R800 billion. The current 
section of the balance sheet is such that we have to buy a new 
computer: there are not enough numerical digits. Of course, I am 
no longer interested in petty cash. I am interested in large 
clients, for example, the Customs Committee. We are now taking a 
number of measures in order to establish complete control over 
the bank, that is, its statutory capital. 
  This has to do with the fact that, unfortunately, ours is 
not 
a civilized country, and many shareholders sincerely believe 
that they may interfere with the affairs of the bank, that they 
know something about the balance sheet. In principle, everything 
may be hidden on the balance sheet so that no audit will find 
it. Since tremendous amounts pass through the bank, the smartest 
shareholders are concerned: And just what is the board doing? 
Besides, the concept of converting large banks to joint-stock 
operations is already hanging in the air. A number of large 
banks have decided to anticipate events and to convert to 
joint-stock operations. As I see it, they have lost a lot by 
doing so, because one and the same share cannot be sold and 
purchased ad infinitum; a moment comes when real operations have 
to be performed. At this point, some guy comes and purchases the 
controlling share. Given that brokers on the exchange are easy 
to buy, arranging the purchase of a controlling share with them 
is no problem at all! We must buy back our statutory capital in 
order completely to shield ourselves against this kind of thing. 
<H5>  3. Horse, Also Known as Cow </H5>
  [Interviewer] Let us try to visualize the banking "map" of 
the country. At present a dozen names are commonly heard, and it 
is a big question who is doing what. 
  [Interviewer] What is the relationship between the Central 
Bank and the commercial banks? Is Gerashchenko a coachman who 
drives you (the bank) like a horse so that it will run in the 
direction needed? 
  [Agapov] The Central Bank is an organ of government; it is, 
if you will, a factory for producing money in the interest of 
the society under the control of the leadership of the country. 
This is a fundamental issue. The monitoring of commercial banks 
is one of its other functions. This is why I would rather liken 
Gerashchenko to a nice milkmaid who, when attaching the milking 
machine to the udder, says: Give it to me, commercial bank! 
  A bank is not commercial because it is "commercial," but 
rather because it serves clients, unlike the Central Bank. This 
is it. In turn, commercial banks are specialized; they are 
divided into land banks, municipal banks, and so on. 
  OCCASIONAL REMARK: This is the same as previously, when 
the minister had enterprise directors reporting to him. The 
Central Bank may grant a license or withhold it, close the bank 
or refrain from closing. 
  [Agapov] To understand all of these inner workings, let us 
recall that the USSR State Bank was an emission center and a 
commercial bank simultaneously. Indeed, it could do everything! 
It gave advice to itself, and controlled itself. During the 
first stage of the restructuring of the banking system of our 
country, there was Matyukhin and the creation of the famous RKTs 
[Cash Clearing Centers]. A segment of the settlement system was 
taken away from the USSR State Bank. At the time, we did not 
understand it, but later I understood that this was done in 
order to lay a hand on spare money in the bustle--withdraw 
the resources, in our parlance. Hence the false advice 
notes, because the two systems--the USSR State Bank and the 
Central Bank of Russia--were never balanced; they existed by 
themselves. The flows of funds between them were precisely the 
"out-of-air" money, which we will no longer see or catch (the 
figure of R3 billion was given; I think that it was considerably 
more). 
  With pain and blood, the USSR State Bank yielded its 
functions one by one to other structures: the government and 
commercial banks. However, the point is that the USSR State Bank 
could generate profits by serving clients. Now, 
having ceased to be a commercial bank, it sort of "forgot" about 
getting profits. So fine, it forgot. However, according to the 
law on the Central Bank, it now generates profits from 
everything, primarily in the form of emission profits. 
  Last summer, the Supreme Soviet tried to cut out the 
remaining functions of the Central Bank in the area of client 
services, and make it into a real Central Bank and forbid it to 
generate profits. It could receive proceeds, but would have to 
live within the cost estimate. Gerashchenko fought this to the 
death--and won! 
  This is how we live now--within a two-tier banking system. 
Understandably, two tiers are easier than three or four. 
However, in real life it is not so, because there is no such 
thing as commercial banks forming a homogeneous structure. All 
of them are different banks: some "for a respectable clientele," 
others, former state banks to which the entire chain, all 
vaults, and all personnel were transferred. Some of them are 
loaded with debt. However, given that these are different banks, 
the conditions for their existence and the extent of their 
jurisdiction and rights should differ. 
  As I see it, at present we have three groups of commercial 
banks. The first group consists of banks authorized with regard 
to major programs, previously called national-economy programs. 
They have high volumes of assets, chains, personnel, operational 
experience, and reputations on the market. There are only about 
10 of them. 
  Next there are specialized banks. Some work with private 
clients, others do investments, yet others--mortgages, and so on. 
  Here is a question: Is an investment bank a commercial bank, 
or a nonbank? This is tremendously interesting! If we treat 
investment banks the same way we do regular banks, we will never 
have investment; we do not have resources for this. This is to 
say, investment banks should be granted some kind of 
preferential terms for attracting and investing resources, and 
for taxation. The same is the case with municipal banks. 
  The idea is simple: If all commercial banks are segregated 
into groups, they should be managed in different ways, too. For 
now, it is more convenient for the state to pile them all 
together; naturally, within the pile, those that are strong will 
always be strong. 
  It is another matter that each bank certainly chooses for 
itself what it engages in. It cannot be regimented this way: As 
a universal bank, you must pay these taxes, have this kind of 
real estate, these reserve funds, and so on. Do work. If you 
can, do work. If you cannot, switch to another category. This is 
what the rules of the game should be. 
<H5>  4. One Cannot Drive a Tank Over It </H5>
  [Interviewer] Why do bankers not seek progressive financial 
legislation? Why is it convenient to treat all banks uniformly? 
  [Interviewer] The law has the wording "other credit 
organizations." What are these--nonbanks? Is it more 
advantageous to be a bank or a nonbank? 
  [Interviewer] Why do commercial banks also interfere with 
the 
affairs of clients? What is in it for you? 
  [Agapov] "Other credit organizations" is an absurdity. A 
huge 
legislative loophole has emerged, whereby money can easily be 
scooped up on an enormous scale, and one can feel fine in the 
process. For example, we have a problem with payments to Ukraine 
and Kazakhstan. A certain company comes along and says: Funds 
will be transferred within one day! The company is not a bank, 
but it is a banking operation! The company should have a license 
with all the requisite guarantees of the rights of clients, with 
the minimum statutory capital, with taxation, and so on. 
However, there is a gap in the law: There are banks, but there 
are no nonbanks, and nothing can be done about it. For example, 
the edict on trusts came out on 24 December, but the Central 
Bank cannot hold anyone accountable for performing these 
operations without a license, since they are nonbanks. 
Naturally, this is advantageous for the nonbanks. They rake in 
money on an almost legitimate basis, and then they can legalize 
their bank. 
  We prepared a text for insertion in the legislation. 
However, 
many people in the Supreme Soviet, including our banking 
geniuses Pochinok and Zadonskiy, simply failed to understand 
what this was about. They are on high, they cannot see, whereas 
we live down here, on the ground. We understand how money is 
raked in out of nowhere. 
  Now about the reason why everything happens this way. 
Because 
of stupidity. This is a serious answer, if you could imagine 
this. Bankers do not lobby enough; legislators do not want this; 
Viktor Vladimirovich Gerashchenko and a great many executives do 
not want that.... 
  I am not expecting anything new to happen now. Actually, 
what 
has changed? Nothing! The banking system is such that one cannot 
drive a tank over it. This is why a situation emerges by and 
large whereby banking practitioners are compelled to make 
certain decisions. For example, one goes to the parliament, 
knocks on one door, and then another, and yet another--nothing 
happens. Fine, he walks away. He tries for a second and a third 
time. Then he gives it up and proceeds to buy deputies. So it 
begins: suitcases full of dollars, trips abroad.... All of it is 
understandable. However, a deputy who has been bought is no 
longer capable of thinking. He merely hangs on his benefactor's 
every word. 
  I believe that this is a wrong move. I am convinced that a 
real politician cannot be bought. A real politician is not for 
sale, and it is a pity to spend money for one who is not real. 
  Why cannot the bankers unite and lobby on the issues needed? 
Because most of them are afflicted with anachronisms and live on 
the principle: You send down to us instructions from the Central 
Bank, and we will comply with them! Question: Why should a 
client have just one settlement account? He might have as many 
of them as he wants, and it is up to him to report this to the 
tax inspectorate. Our banks are still forced to be control 
agents. This is why we go into your accounts. Since there is a 
bank, let it be accountable for wages, for the consumption fund, 
for foreign-exchange operations. How can a bank do this, given 
that there is a legal entity--its client, and that this client 
is liable, with his wallet and his freedom, to the procurator 
and the tax inspectorate on account of his actions? What has the 
bank got to do with it? No, they do not hear this! The Edict on 
Foreign Economic Operations says directly: All banks holding 
foreign-exchange licenses must perform the functions of 
foreign-exchange control. This is insane. A client did not 
make the full payment to the state out of foreign-exchange 
proceeds, and I will be liable! Whatever for will I be liable? 
<H5>  5. About Common People, "Short Money," and the Long Arm </H5>
  [Interviewer] For now, it makes no difference for citizens 
whether it is you or the Savings Bank. Nonetheless, the citizens 
are enticed by promises, by these 30-percent profits on a 
monthly basis, and get in waiting lines in front of banks. What 
do you do in order to attract them? Do you need them at all? 
  [Agapov] The question is: Have banks become a social 
institution or not? Do they work in the interest of individual 
citizens? No. Why? Because banks are established, finance 
companies are established, exchanges are established, but nobody 
teaches the citizens anything. The citizens are, in a way, by 
themselves, and this entire system is by itself. This is why, as 
I see it, in the course of accomplishing major economic tasks, 
it would be more honest to say, looking the people in the eye: 
Esteemed citizens! The economy will not be restructured in two 
or three years. It cannot be. The citizens must be trained and 
prepared. 
  In our country, they try to teach people by hitting them 
painfully over the head. The people will not understand if they 
are hit over the head, and if they have antediluvian educations. 
They understand nothing, and they believe in some abstract 
state, government, and leadership. It does not make a difference 
who is in the leadership, as long as there is an authority. The 
issue of the mentality of clientele is a very broad issue. For 
now, citizens are not ready for a relationship with a bank, and 
we are not ready to work with citizens. The Savings Bank is the 
only bank capable of this. It has a chain and it has personnel. 
We cannot do it because we pay taxes on proceeds, taxes on 
profits, taxes on fixed assets. The taxes are very high. It is 
not advantageous for us to commission new premises which will 
not yield quick profits. 
  Getting rich quickly at any price does not mean 
services to the population. This is bluffing, just as the 
infamous 30 percent, or whatever, per month. This is pure deceit 
without guarantees because there is reality, and this reality is 
that the margin (profit of the bank--editorial note by OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA) on credit resources should come to no less than 30 
points. At present, short-term resources cost about 200 percent 
on the market. Calculate this: I must place 200-percent 
resources at 230 percent. This is virtually the limit. In all of 
that, with a 30-point margin I barely make ends meet, cover my 
outlays, and get meager profits. 
  How are big profits to be made? There is a source, so-called 
"short money"--this is the placement of money for one to seven 
days. The game is that all banks participating in the process 
conduct operations through one correspondent account at one 
RKTs. An agreement is signed to the effect that the RKTs will 
itself debit funds from the correspondent account when the 
deadline comes, automatically. Therefore, payments are 
guaranteed. "Short-money" operations are very profitable. 
However, the main question is: Who gets the profit? 
Naturally, the few large donor banks, of which our bank is one. 
Everyone else is a consumer. Those who receive credit and work 
on it in transit do not "play" on the market. They do have a 
certain margin, they do get by somehow, but they cannot pay out 
30 percent a month. 
  You see, the 30 percent is an illusion. The people raised 
large amounts by several operations, and it seemed to them that 
this was it! The same applies to currency operations. In all 
honesty, I laugh when some banks guarantee 25-30 percent in 
foreign exchange! 
  In general, mutual relations between banks and the 
population 
are a very interesting issue. As it were, clients sincerely 
believe that they have no need for a bank, and that the banker 
is definitely a crook if he gets himself a Mercedes. This is how 
they have been conditioned. Since the banker is a thief, they 
should not come to him at all, or should come to him with a red 
sign, or better yet go straight to the procurator, or else 
organize a demonstration. I do not want to have a demonstration 
next to my bank and, naturally, I will never strive to engage in 
extensive operations with private individuals. What do I need 
this headache for? 
  The second aspect: Actually, what can the population 
accomplish for the bank? Cash rubles? I do not need them! I 
would have to build new vaults, set up a counting shop, buy 
armored cars, and so on, and so forth. 
  OCCASIONAL REMARK: It is impossible to get rid of 
hatred for the man in the latest model Mercedes or Volvo if one 
does not treat him as a client and therefore does not invest 
money in the banking infrastructure. There are a few 
establishments, for the most part quite suspect, where a great 
many people stream with their money. Old women are as numerous 
there as young people wearing leather jackets. 
  [Agapov] In a serious vein, a shift in consciousness is of 
course taking place, but for now it is venturesome, in a way. No 
sooner is a child born in the West than they already begin to 
teach him: Here is your insurance; take this toy money and play 
with it, and the child grows into the market-economy life 
naturally. In turn, our people play when they are already grown 
up. They play stocks, play something else, invest money without 
audit reports, without verification, without anything! The most 
terrifying things will begin when these organizations go under 
en masse, and when citizens understand that they have been truly 
swindled in a big way. This will be a collapse of confidence in 
the entire banking system, a catastrophe. However, there is only 
one way I can warn about it--speak publicly and tell the already 
mentioned old woman: My dear, there is nothing I can do for you! 
This is the most I can do, because an armored Mercedes can be 
blown away with a regular grenade launcher. It does not cost too 
much.... 
<H5>  6. What Should Be Done in Order Not To Swing From a Lamppost? </H5>
  [Interviewer] You understand the danger of your existence 
from the class standpoint. What prevents you from uniting and 
working out an action program so that you will not be smashed to 
smithereens? 
  [Interviewer] Some banks, having appreciated the potential 
of 
the press and television, are buying them, as the saying goes, 
lock, stock, and barrel, in an attempt to establish an 
information monopoly. Do you intend to follow their example? 
  [Agapov] I am perfectly aware that all of us may be swinging 
from the lampposts next to the government, next to 
entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, and all other "enemies of the 
people." Unfortunately, the mass media fuel this opinion of us 
as enemies of the people, and to my mind, deliberately, to a 
considerable degree. They do not understand that they themselves 
will swing from the adjacent lampposts. 
  Indeed, why does a common cause fail to unite the 
entrepreneurs? First, because all of them feed at different 
troughs. Some feed at the trough of the head of oblast 
administration, others--at the trough of the mayor, still 
others--at the trough of the government, and so on, and so 
forth. Such is reality. Second, all of those feeding are very 
different people. The notion of caste is stronger in the banking 
community than anywhere else. For example, a person comes to the 
financial market. He has already put together a bank, made big 
money, and made arrangements with whomever it takes. He is rich. 
But he is a nobody! Nobody wants to talk to him. He is ready to 
pay any money to be admitted to the professional bunch, to just 
sit at the same table and have a talk. They do not take him in. 
  There is a precisely delineated circle--a circle of banking 
veterans. This is the Central Bank, the entire organization of 
the Bank for Foreign Economic Relations, the former specialized 
banks. These people have known each other for many years; they 
take care of their own. From among new people, they only admit 
those who are from their alma mater, who studied under the same 
instructors. 
  I spent about two years in order simply to gather together 
more than 20 bankers from all three spheres: the specialized 
banks, the Central Bank, and the new commercial banks. Two 
years, although ours is not the worst reputation around and, 
generally, we are well known. Why did they come, all of these 
banking tycoons? Perhaps they understood after all the need to 
unite. The main issue is how to unite. How is one to unite with 
someone who has sold his bank to Americans, or to other foreign 
"teachers?" How to be friends when the direction of interests 
differs? I for one understand full well that, whether I like it 
or not, one person will be shooting at another whatever the 
array. Unfortunately, such is life.... 
  As far as the monopoly on the press and television is 
concerned, I have my own view on it, just as on Likhachev's 
murder. I am convinced that Likhachev's murder was political, 10 
days before the election, in order to disturb the people. For 
some reason, they cannot find anyone! Just like the guy who ran 
over an OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] serviceman on 
1 May: Everyone saw him, but he cannot be found! 
  I think that a real rich man will never advertise: a) that 
he 
is rich; b) that there are very important people standing behind 
him! A rich man will do everything quietly....unless somebody 
pushes him from behind. What do I need newspapers for? What are 
radio and television for? These are insane expenditures! About 
$20 million-$30 million is necessary to get a TV channel going. 
So what is all of that for? I think that preparations are under 
way for forthcoming political changes which, naturally, will be 
accomplished by those who are not in the limelight. The 
unexpected resignation of our main reformer, Yegor Timurovich, 
seemed very strange to me. It would appear that a fight was on, 
rivers of blood were being spilled--fight to the death, you are 
the reformer, you promised the people! No, he quit! Later, 
Fedorov made the patently unrealistic demand concerning 
Gerashchenko--and also quit grandly. All of this makes me feel 
that some kind of a lunge at the government and the president is 
being prepared. 
  OCCASIONAL REMARK: The views of most varied analysts 
are similar in that a political collapse may indeed occur in 
late spring or early summer. Given this prospect, the departure 
of Gaydar and Fedorov means that from a politico-economic point 
of view, they have acted as military engineers: They installed a 
delayed-action mine that must go off, and it is not known when. 
Understandably, bankers feel this. 
  [Agapov] It will be very complicated for us to counteract 
this situation. To help the broad masses understand why Gaydar 
and Fedorov have quit is the only thing that may be 
realistically accomplished at present. The real clash will thus 
be delayed for a certain period of time, and the financial 
muscle will grow, because we understand full well: No matter who 
is in power, he will not kill the goose that lays the golden 
eggs. She will be turned into a cow and milked. However, I 
believe that we will not be milked worse than by Gaydar and 
Fedorov. 
<H5>  7. Is Gerashchenko as Bad as He Is Made Out To Be? </H5>
  [Interviewer] For many people associated with the financial 
and economic sphere, Gerashchenko has become a symbol, a 
personification of state-perpetrated fraud. It was not money but 
rather the shadow of money that was traded. This shadow is 
growing longer with every passing year. In essence, you are 
helping him do it. Are you going to get along with him like 
this? Or is it that he does not get in your way? 
  [Agapov] Yes, Gerashchenko indeed puts money into 
circulation. However, who laid the foundation for this emission? 
Who was it? Could it be that Gaydar's edict on decontrolling 
prices played no role? Or that credit that Fedorov extended to 
industry was likewise not significant? 
  This is how I would put it: Deception occurs both in the 
Central Bank and around the Central Bank; however, the degree of 
this deception is definitely insignificant compared to what is 
happening in the government. The Central Bank is actually a 
transit element; it transmits the ideas that were introduced 
into it. This is the first point. Second, Mr. Gerashchenko has 
the traits that I like the most in bankers--he is an intelligent 
and well-balanced person. 
  Why do they dislike Gerashchenko so much? Because he is 
upper 
class. He came from a job abroad. He is squeaky clean, and all 
of the regional managers of the Central Bank are like 
blue-collar workers compared to him. Gerashchenko has lacked a 
real cadre base from the very beginning. Meanwhile, the banking 
system is oh, so complicated! Any idea may be nixed within half 
a second. Why did Gerashchenko go for it? After all, he 
understood full well that he would be removed, driven to 
imprisonment, or smeared with dirt. However, he wanted to 
try delaying the catastrophic decline of our economy toward 
which the people who have read a lot of books and know clever 
words but do not know beans about banking are irrepressibly 
proceeding. 
  Of course, they do not like him: He has shown major 
adherence 
to solving problems nationally. To give the last shirt off our 
backs and to throw ourselves on the mercy of gentlemen from 
abroad, sometimes for $24 billion, and sometimes for something 
else, is all that our reformers have proposed. Gerashchenko's 
position is different: to prevent high-technology enterprises 
from going under, to continue supporting them and try to 
restructure them, even if on an inflationary basis. He sustains, 
say, Krasnoyarsk-2, which manufactures satellites, and so on, 
and he is accused of being a scoundrel and a villain. 
  We have our own major complaints to make about Gerashchenko, 
but he does not interfere with the development of the banking 
system, does he? If Fedorov were in Gerashchenko's position, he 
would do in about 80 percent of the banks at present by using 
the bankruptcy law. This is very simple to do. Gerashchenko 
understands that this could not be done; a precedent cannot be 
created. However, Gerashchenko is alone, he does not have a 
team, and for this reason he cannot make operational decisions. 
  Two years ago, I suggested this: Let us not saddle 
Gerashchenko and Fedorov with everything. Let us create a 
special Council of Commercial Banks, a national 
banking council. Let it be confirmed by an edict of the 
president or the parliament, and let it assume some of the 
responsibility. The council could resolve issues of reserves, 
standards for bank operations, issues of taxation and resource 
distribution, and make recommendations on the issuance of 
licenses--after all, we know everyone within our community. 
  First Matyukhin and then Gerashchenko categorically came out 
against this. Two years have passed, and the idea has been 
approved, after all. It will be released publicly in the 
immediate future. It is just that there is nowhere to go; there 
will be an impasse otherwise. 
  I understand full well that Gerashchenko will apparently 
quit 
together with the cabinet. However, his task is to find now some 
form of a connection between the Central Bank and commercial 
banks, and such a connection which nobody will ever be able to 
break. Commercial banks cannot be destroyed in principle, 
because commercial banks mean clients. Only in the movies does 
Zheleznyak the sailor come along and close whatever. This does 
not happen in real life. I have, for example, 30,000 clients; 
converted to the number of people, this is an entire army, and 
for all commercial banks, it is the population of the country. 
This is why playing games with the banks does not work. 
  OCCASIONAL REMARK: It worked for Pavlov, and for 
Zheleznyaks it worked, too. 
  [Agapov] Pavlov was not playing games with the banks. That 
was a centralized system. As far as Zheleznyaks.... 
History does not repeat itself twice at the same location.

<F P=106> [Article by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA economic commentator Arkadiy </F>
Solovyev under the rubric "Viewpoint": "Taking a Penny From a 
Pauper..."] 
  [Text] Our newspaper published two immediate comments 
on Boris Yeltsin's Edict "On Lump-Sum Compensation to Russian 
Federation Savings Bank Depositors Who Had Money on Deposit as 
of 1 January 1992." It is now time to take a more detailed look 
at this document. 
  As if to prove the folk saying that "one waits three years 
for a promise to come true," in precisely the third year of the 
reformation era the president, prompted by the generosity of the 
former chief cashier of the country, finally decided to show 
much favor to his subjects by giving them an unexpected 
gift--compensating for people's losses from the devaluation of 
their deposits in savings institutions. The "generosity" of the 
gift-givers is shocking even to ordinary folk schooled in the 
experiences of the period of shock therapy. 
  It is therefore not accidental that the actual text of the 
corresponding edict issued by the president was concealed from 
the mass media for almost a month and a half, while the 
government press published only tear-jerking panegyrics about 
the fatherly concern for the huddled masses. An attentive study 
of this rescript's text brings very sad thoughts to mind. 
  What does a tripling of deposits kept in savings accounts as 
of 1 January 1992 mean? It means that given inflation of a 
factor of at least 260 over the period 1992-1993 (according to 
data of the Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics), 
respectable citizens of Russia who had been trying to save their 
money with the help of the Savings Bank system will get slightly 
more than 1 (one) kopek on each ruble deposited before 1992. 
  It should be remembered that even the size of the lump-sum 
minimum wage raise instituted in order to compensate for 
Gaydar's jump in prices on 1 January 1992 measured a factor of 
3.5. Thus, the tripling of deposits, coming more than two years 
late, is incommensurate in scale even with the shameless 
stealing of workers' wages. 
  Of course, any minimally literate person knows that the 
money 
we used to put in the state savings bank system at a miserly 
interest rate were withdrawn into the state treasury and used to 
pay off internal debt or at best for investment in the national 
economy and patching holes in the budget. In other words, our 
money was used in such a way that it could not earn us any 
income and it is apparently no longer there anyway. If in those 
quite recent times (when we still had a state budget and one 
could at least calculate some things and compare them in a 
normal way) all depositors simultaneously had withdrawn their 
money from the savings bank, the state would have immediately 
become bankrupt. Because the amount of deposits was commensurate 
with the size of the national income, the payroll fund, and the 
state budget. 
  The acknowledgement of savings bank deposits as a state 
debt, 
expressed in the decision of supreme organs of legislative 
authority in Russia, by itself should have meant, in my opinion, 
a legal and material-financial guarantee of their security and 
the ability to put it to its direct use (be it as it may on 
certain terms). Instead of our ruble, however, which we loaned 
to the state, we are being offered a kopek. 
  I think it is inarguable that the purchasing capacity of 
savings should be restored through their indexation. The 
mechanism is well known: in keeping with the consumer price 
index. In 1992 prices increased by a factor of 26, in 1992--by a 
factor of 10. This makes it a total factor of 260 by 1 January 
of the current year. Which means that slightly under 100 
trillion rubles [R] (R372 billion times 260) should be 
automatically entered into savings books. 
  Among the arguable questions that remain are the following 
major items: 
  --what to do about indexation of savings for 1991, which 
lagged by an order of magnitude behind inflation? 
  --how to restrict (within the boundaries of constitutional 
rights and laws) the flow of this money into the already 
impoverished consumer market? 
  --where to get this money long used up by the previous 
government? 
  Answering these and other questions will require more than 
one newspaper page, and I do not have ready recipes for 
everything. One thing is obvious: the compensation of deposits 
by a factor of three, as envisaged by the edict, is a violation 
of the constitutional right of citizens to property and its 
security. This compensation cannot be called anything other than 
a miserly handout. 
  The government must put together a long-term (let us say, 
10-year) program for repayment of the internal state debt to 
savings bank depositors. This program, in my opinion, must 
include direct budget financing of compensatory payments (which, 
by the way, the government has already been tasked with in the 
president's March edict), the use of state nonbudget funds 
(pension and medical, employment and social protection), the use 
of property payments (in the form of an additional share in the 
privatized property--production, housing, and land), and so on. 
  In this context we could look at the proposed compensation 
as 
the first phase or a component part of the state program for 
repaying the debt to depositors. 
  I know that many people are puzzled by a half-year gap in 
payments to those who are able to work and those who are not. 
First, most elderly people transferred their accounts to their 
heirs, who support them, long ago. Second, the current economic 
reality is such that it is precisely the working people who are 
experiencing the greatest material difficulties--because of the 
mindless structural restructuring of production and conversion, 
mutual nonpayments between enterprises and the disruption of 
economic ties, the breakdown of the state financial system, and 
so on. Life is especially hard for those employed in education 
and health care, science and culture, as well as geologists and 
the machine-building sector. Millions of them have not been paid 
even the minimum wage for months. They are the ones who could 
use most even this pithy compensation. It would be no less 
important for the residents of northern regions, who this winter 
found themselves on the threshold of survival. 
  And one more, perhaps the most delicate, element--the frank 
absence of the financial resources needed to accomplish the 
announced operation. The amounts that are being mentioned 
clearly are insufficient. Only Central Bank credit could serve 
as a reliable source. But the R200 billion promised by the bank 
will only be enough to pay compensation to pensioners and the 
disabled. There is a real danger that the matter not only will 
not get to the point of paying able-bodied citizens, but that 
there will not be enough even to pay the pensioners their 
"kopek." 
  The triple compensation of deposits envisaged by the edict 
will require R1.1-1.2 trillion in 1994. Neither the Savings Bank 
nor the draft state budget have this sort of money for this 
purpose. Are we dealing with another "fairy tale?" Sad... 
  I will not even mention other, no less sad, considerations 
that come to mind when one analyzes the edict. All I want is to 
learn the names of the authors of this masterpiece. Operational 
"investigation" has revealed that neither the Savings Bank nor 
the Central Bank nor the social security administration had 
advance knowledge of the text of the edict. The carefully 
concealed "creators" hide from people behind the oak doors of a 
department of the Ministry of Finance. I think it is time to ask 
them to take a curtain call.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kotelnikova: "Association Accuses the </F>
Government in Crisis"] 
  [Text] The investment crisis is the main obstacle along the 
path of market adaptation by denationalized enterprises. This 
can be seen from the results of the Russia-wide conference--"On 
the Use of Credits and Technical Assistance Afforded by 
International Financial Organizations in Accordance with the 
Program of Support for Privatization and Structural 
Transformations in Russia"--conducted 5 February at the Moscow 
Association of Privatized and Private Enterprises. Conference 
participants demanded that the government institute measures 
which would stimulate investments in denationalized enterprises. 
  The Association of Privatized and Private Enterprises 
was established in November 1992. It unites about 3,000 
enterprises and has 49 regional divisions. The president of the 
association is Yegor Gaydar. 
  Voucher privatization has enabled the denationalization of 
more than 8,000 medium and large-scale enterprises and has 
brought about a steady demand for investments. Deputy Prime 
Minister Anatoliy Chubays, however, who took part in the 
conference, explains the lack of investments not just by virtue 
of the economic crisis, but by the absence of a purposeful state 
investment policy as well. This circumstance has a direct effect 
on attracting large and long-term investments in privatized 
enterprises. 
  According to data from the Russian Property Fund, the total 
amount obtained from the sale of blocks of shares of 
denationalized enterprises at investment auctions in 1993 came 
to 1.2 trillion rubles [R], i.e., 8 percent of the investment 
volume of the Russian market. In this regard, short-term 
programs (up to two years) clearly dominated, while long-term 
programs (up to six years) comprised just 6 percent of all 
investment projects. Under these conditions, the association 
proposed that the government implement urgent measures to 
stimulate investments in denationalized enterprises. The Program 
of Support for Privatization and Structural Transformations in 
Russia, developed with the participation of the State Committee 
for Property Management, is specifically aimed at achieving 
this. It includes the affording of advantageous (paid for by 
international financial organizations), competent consulting and 
auditing assistance to the councils of directors of joint-stock 
companies in developing their investment projects and choosing 
investors. In the words of Anatoliy Chubays, however, the 
program has still not been formally approved by the government, 
and its confirmation is expected within the next 10 days.

percent of charter capital (with a range of 10-50 percent in 
volume of shares in blocks) 
  --Total investment volume offered at investment auctions in 
1993 amounted to R1.2 trillion, including $1 billion and DM35.6 
million (with an investment volume of R15 trillion in the 
Russian market in 1993)

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Illarionov, director of the analysis and </F>
planning group of the Russian government's chairman: "There Has 
Been No Catastrophic Decline But Its Myth Remains"] 
  [Text] The myth about a catastrophic production decline has 
become one of the more popular ones of recent times. How does it 
correspond to reality? 
  Owing to the fact that officially published data from 
Russia's State Committee for Statistics do not consider the 
seasonal impact, they have economic meaning only when compared 
with the previous year's corresponding period. 
  Different procedures for determining the physical volume and 
seasonal leveling are used for the purposes of a practical 
appraisal of the current situation. A group of specialists from 
the Russian Federation Government's Economic Situation Center, 
Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for Market Problems, 
Russian Academy of Sciences' Computer Center, and the RSPP 
[Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] Institute of 
Experts regularly acquaint the public with one of these systems 
and the results obtained as a result. 
  The Russian Federation Government's Workers' Center for 
Economic Reforms has also conducted a seasonal leveling of the 
physical volume index of industrial production calculated by 
Russia's State Committee for Statistics. The main components of 
the calculation procedure are similar in both cases. At the same 
time, it is necessary to point out differences that exist. 
  1. The mentioned group of specialists constructed the 
physical volume index on the basis of 40 (later 42) 
representative commodities. Russia's State Committee for 
Statistics used a set consisting of 372 commodities in 120 
industrial branches and sub-branches, which embraced 70 percent 
of the total volume of industrial products. 
  2. The group of specialists constructed the physical volume 
index as the average geometric value of 42 rows. In our case, a 
weighting method in constant prices based on the actual 
production structure, which has been accepted in international 
practices, was used. 
  3. The 42 commodities selected by the group of specialists 
reflected the structure of industrial production and also the 
proportions between Groups A and B in accordance with conditions 
in 1990. In our calculations, the production structure changes 
annually as a result of the deferent production dynamics in the 
various branches depending on the actual change in the 
relationships between them. 
  The results obtained were subjected to dual verification. 
First, they were compared with the data obtained from a total 
accounting of the enterprises. Second, the results of the 
seasonal leveling were compared with the results of a direct 
comparison with the corresponding period of the previous year. 
In both cases, the magnitude of the deviation did not exceed 1.5 
percent. This is completely acceptable with the present state of 
our domestic statistics. 
  The results of our calculations are reflected in the table. 
It is not difficult to see that these results differ noticeably 
from the data obtained by the mentioned group of experts. 
  In May 1993, the experts pointed out a substantial reduction 
in the rates of decline (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 36) and in 
June -- even a stabilization in the level of production 
(FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 40). According to our data, an 
evident acceleration in the industrial decline occurred during 
May-June. 
  The experts called the production decline in August 1993 an 
"absolute record for all the time of observations -- a decline 
which had not existed before" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 49). 
True, they had already tacitly rejected this thesis a month 
later, judging from a graph published in FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, 
No 54. According to our data, the decline in August, although it 
was extremely deep, unquestionably did not yield to the August 
1992 slump in its scale. 
  In September 1993, the experts again fixed "high menacing 
rates of decline" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 53). At that time, 
there was not only no decline in fact but a so-called 
compensating industrial upsurge was present. 
  Finally, the experts noted a "slowing down in the rates of 
decline" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 54) in October, at a time 
when our data simply testified to the stabilization of 
industrial production. 
  Moreover, the experts did not once note any industrial 
production growth during the two years, at a time when they set 
the rates for its decline from minus 5 percent to minus 44 
percent during various months converted to a year's rate (cf. 
the graph in FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 53). These data 
contradict not only our calculations but also real life. 
  Generally speaking, the picture of industrial production 
dynamics during the last three years looks as follows. During 
the first half of 1991, a gradual reduction in the level of 
industrial production was noted. The first sharp drop came 
during August 1991 when the putsch occurred. After a certain 
rise in September, the disintegration of the old economic and 
political system, which had begun, caused an accelerating 
decline during the fall of 1991, which concluded with a sharp 
decline in January 1992. 
  It is evident that the price liberalization, which was 
implemented at the time, was not able in principle to have a 
decisive impact on the decline in the level of production. 
Rather long time lags between the change in consumer demand and 
the reaction of the production supply to it exist. Accumulated 
factors from the production, political and administrative 
disintegration during the fall of 1991 played the main role in 
the decline during January 1992. 
  The absence of an impact on production dynamics from the 
freeing of prices is also confirmed by the February-April 1992 
data, when industrial production remained at a stable and even 
higher level during the three months than in January. It was 
only in May under the influence of a really reduced demand and 
the heightened crisis of nonpayments that production began to be 
curtailed, reaching its maximum level of decline in August 1992 
(minus 13.6 percent by July 1992). All told, production declined 
by 25.4 percent during the four months (April to August). 
  The mutual crediting of nonpayments, which was done in the 
summer of 1992, along with massive credit pumping caused a 
compensating increase in production of 11.5 percent in September 
1992. Thanks to the vigorous credit support, the production 
level subsequently remained practically stable for eight months 
-- up to April 1993; however, it was paid for by Russian 
consumers in the form of 25-30 percent monthly inflation. The 
decline in January 1993 is not included in the calculation 
because it was caused not by economic but by purely calendar 
reasons -- the Christmas holidays were celebrated on a large 
scale for the first time in the country. 
  The next stage in the cut-back of production was connected 
with the new stage of the government's crucial financial and 
monetary policy, which began during the first months of 1993. 
Production fell by 19.6 percent from April to August, including 
9.7 percent in August 1993 when compared to July. 
  The new period of industrial production stabilization 
(September-December 1993), which then began with the stricter 
monetary policy and real lowering of inflation rates (to 13 
percent in December), is evidence of exceptionally important 
changes in the economy. This means that industry had basically 
already discarded production volumes oriented toward an 
artificially exaggerated inflationary demand and had really 
begun to draw nearer to a rational level that did not need to be 
supported by credit drugs. It was from this or a slightly lower 
level that the revival stage and then healthy industrial growth 
could begin this year with the insuring of strict financial 
limitations. 
  Thus, the statements, which have recently been heard about 
the production catastrophe that has begun, are unfounded. 
  The expected sharp decline in production during January 1994 
in no way differs in its nature from the one in January 1993. 
The only difference is that instead of having two days off as a 
year ago, the country preferred not to work two weeks this year. 
It is possible to expect that compensation will occur in 
February for the January decline. 
  At the same time, the coming change in the government's 
economic policy and the next enthusiasm for a credit emission 
will exert a depressing affect on the level of industrial 
production. The inflation caused by this will deprive the 
producers of incentives to even maintain the production process. 
Then (but not now as some are hurrying to declare), the country 
could really find itself in a so-called "stagflation trap" where 
the incentives for production provided by an additional credit 
emission are more than stifled by the inflation unleashed as a 
result of it.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Sabbateyeva: "Inequality in Russia: The </F>
Genie Coefficient Is Rising"] 
  [Text] The "consumption boom" Andrey Illarionov 
writes about has affected different groups of Russians in 
different ways because the rapid stratification of the 
population according to income levels continued last year. 
According to the data of the State Committee for Statistics, the 
income of the wealthiest 10 percent in 1993 was 11 times as high 
as the income of the bottom 10 percent. In 1992 the correlation 
was 7.5-8 times, and in 1991 it was 4.5 times. 
  It might be a good idea to add the specialized term "Genie 
coefficient" to our common terminology. This coefficient is an 
index of income concentration, ranging from 0 to 1. It measures 
the distribution of income from the point of total equality (0) 
to the point at which everything belongs to a single individual 
(1). At the end of 1993, for example, the coefficient in Russia 
was 0.346. For the sake of comparison, it was 0.327 at the end 
of 1992 and 0.256 at the end of 1991. 
  According to last year's figures, the per capita income of 
one out of every three Russians was below the minimum 
subsistence level, and the monetary income of 13 percent of the 
population did not exceed the minimum food allowance. The income 
of 5 percent of the citizens of Russia was below the minimum 
required for physiological survival. The table illustrates the 
degree of stratification.

  Average per capita monetary income in November 1993 was 
37,908 rubles. This was the average for all segments of the 
population. The average was 42,799 rubles for able-bodied 
adults, 26,705 rubles for pensioners, and 37,896 rubles for 
children. The minimum subsistence level is calculated according 
to the methods of the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor and 
includes expenditures on food, based on minimum consumption, 
expenditures on non-food items and services, and taxes and 
obligatory payments--based on the proportional expenditures of 
the 10 percent of families with the lowest incomes. 
  Now our discussions of increasing inequality will require a 
slight adjustment. Up to this point we have based these 
judgments on the monetary income of the population, but social 
divisions based on these income levels are not equivalent to the 
actual patterns of stratification. Some of the main social means 
(primarily housing and also, to some extent, transportation and 
medicine) are being distributed more equally because they are 
financed with state budget funds. This means that actual 
inequality is not increasing as quickly as we once believed.

"Prices Disobeyed the Prime Minister"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Will the Government Be Able To Pull Through? </H5>
  In one week the price of regular domestically produced 
analgesic went up on average across the country by 15 rubles 
[R]. On 1 February it cost R810 in Yakutsk, R650 in Ukhta, and 
R336 in St. Petersburg (in many cities--Vorkuta, Cherepovets, 
Yelets, Naberezhnyye Chelny, and others--this medicine was not 
available for sale altogether). Nitroglycerin, which a person 
with a heart condition must always have on him (his life may 
depend on it) was not available on 1 February in the pharmacies 
of Belgorod, Tambov, Astrakhan, and Norilsk. In Naberezhnyye 
Chelny this medicine cost R144, and in Chita--R153. 
  I am leafing through a thick reference book prepared by the 
Goskomstat [State Committee on Statistics] of Russia, which 
lists prices in different cities as of 1 February. A color 
television set in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk--R1 million; regular 
children's cotton socks in Ulyanovsk--R800; shoe repair in 
Magadan--R7,500. Of course, prices are not like this everywhere; 
in other cities they are lower, but still the magnitude of the 
figures is disheartening. The average price of beef is almost 
R2,500 (R2,414), but in Yakutsk it costs more than R5,000, and 
in Khabarovsk--about R4,000. 
  In Krasnoyarsk the price of butter in the stores over one 
week went up by almost R600, crossing the R5,000 mark. In Kyzyl 
it costs even more: R5,972 per kg; in Moscow--R7,400 at the 
farmers market and R2,842 in retail trade outlets (a 
R180-increase over the week). 
  All prices are rising, but it is especially noticeable 
looking at foods that in the past used to be part of Russians' 
daily nutrition. In Apatity the price of rye-wheat bread went up 
by more than one-quarter over the week and now costs R525. The 
average (across the country) price of 10 hen eggs exceeded 
R1,000 (R1,023.70) in retail trade; at the market they cost 
R1,290. A liter of milk in Severodvinsk already costs R1,000, in 
Kemerovo--R790, and in Moscow R2,170 at the market and R458 in 
retail trade (by now, closer to R500 and up). 
  These are not at all cheerful statistics. Prices rose in 
January much faster than the leadership of the government had 
anticipated. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in December 
that in the first quarter "the rate of inflation will drop to 
15-16 percent." But prices in January "disobeyed" the prime 
minister and increased by 21 percent. This shows that the 
economy is still sick; it has a long way to go to get healthy, 
and a new wave of inflation may hit us in March-April. 
  It was not too long ago that statements of a number of 
ministers and the deputy prime minister sounded very optimistic: 
the worst is behind us, they said; inflation is receding; the 
economy is on the upturn. They quoted figures to support these 
contentions: in October 1993 the inflation rate was 20 percent, 
in November--16 percent, and in December--13 percent. But at the 
same time they somehow failed to mention that the country was 
living sort of on credit, because the state moved many payouts 
from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of the 
current one. Which amounted to no more, no less, than R7.8 
trillion (for grain delivered to state storage facilities; state 
orders fulfilled by defense enterprises; payouts in the 
budget-financed sphere, including back pay; etc.). 
  That is, the budget deficit was in a way artificially 
reduced. But one cannot postpone debt repayments forever. They 
have to be paid, except that now current payments will be added 
to them. The amounts being mentioned now for the expense part of 
the budget are in the tens of trillions rubles. This means that 
with a certain time lag (a month and a half or two) a new 
avalanche of money will descend on the marketplace, and prices 
will start rising like yeast. It is possible that inflation in 
February will slow down somewhat (to 18-19 percent), but in 
March-April it may rise to 22-25 percent. And then our economy 
will enter a period of new severe trials. 
<H5>  There Is No `Uncle' To Keep Us Fed and Clothed </H5>
  Is it possible to avoid these tribulations by conducting, 
for 
instance, an even tougher monetarist policy, by delaying 
payments until the next quarter, and then again the next one, 
or, on the contrary, by handing money out right and left? I 
think that neither option is the best solution; they will only 
exacerbate the ills of our economy. Until full-scale structural 
restructuring begins in industry and all sectors of the national 
economy, we will not see any success. 
  Yes, most of our goods are not competitive in the world 
market. This means we have to install new technologies and 
modernize shops and plants. This requires enormous money and 
investors. Meanwhile, however, we cannot allow all of light 
industry to grind to a halt, and "close down" domestic 
agriculture. There is no "uncle" to keep us fed and clothed. 
  Meanwhile, production continues to decline. I will quote 
perhaps the most alarming figures over the two years of reforms. 
In "shock" January 1992 production declined by 15-16 percent, in 
the difficult January 1993--by 17-18 percent, and in January of 
the current year--by 23 percent. The solvency crisis and the 
disarray in the economy provoke increasingly new rounds of 
decline, and it looks as if the economy, like an aircraft out of 
control, is entering a tailspin. Had the appropriations not been 
used for consumption, had they not been turned into dollars and 
channeled abroad but used instead for structural restructuring, 
refurbishing and modernization of industry, one could at least 
understand 20-percent inflation. But a new round of inflation 
against the background of a deteriorating economy is too much. 
Unless the government in the very near future finds effective 
levers to radically change the situation, it will not survive 
until the fall. 
  Such levers do exist. Take for example the defense complex. 
The directors of many idling plants with first-class equipment 
are begging (and not for the first year) for just one thing: 
Tell us precisely how much military hardware will be needed for 
1994, 1995, 1996, and subsequent years? There is such a 
notion--mobilization capacities. This is the foundation of the 
national defense. A plant director, under the threat of severe 
punishment, cannot take even a bolt off an assembly line, let 
alone dismantle the line itself. So shops stand idle for years 
(or operate at 10 percent of capacity), and no one will take the 
responsibility to decide their fate. 
  Another lever is to attract investors. Guarantees for 
businessmen in the form of Russian real estate abroad (in the 
event of loss of investment in political cataclysms) would open 
the road for capital to our market, which has a skilled labor 
force and ready infrastructure (buildings, communications, 
etc.). There are other options as well. But so far nothing moves 
beyond endless discussions, The state even has no interest in 
its own enterprises as the owner, and is not conducting 
structural restructuring of those that are very promising. 
  Meanwhile, credit liability amounted to R48 trillion as of 
the beginning of the year, of which past due arrears comprise 
R17 trillion. The most acute solvency crisis is in Vologda, 
Leningrad, Kemerovo, Omsk, and Kamchatka Oblasts and a number of 
other regions. 
<H5>  Wages: Millionaires and Paupers </H5>
  The solvency crisis not only paralyzes the economy--for many 
Russians it means delays in labor remuneration. Of course, the 
picture is far from uniform in this respect. It is one thing 
when a nonstate enterprise (a potential bankrupt) accumulates 
back pay because all it has is debts--this is, after all, its 
problem; and it is a completely different thing when workers in 
the budget-financed sphere are not paid because the state does 
not keep its word and does not pay its debts. 
  Unfortunately, no statistics are kept as yet that separate 
back pay into budget and nonbudget debt. But judging by reports 
from localities, the budget debt is very substantial. Does the 
government not understand that by such actions it not only 
discredits itself but also provokes a rapid rise in social 
tension in society? By holding back labor remuneration and thus 
"slowing down" the rate of inflation with this uncivilized, 
savage method, the government loses much more than it gains. 
  The total arrears with respect to labor remuneration in 
industry, construction, and agriculture alone amounted to R766 
billion as of 1 January. This means that millions of people are 
making do without money, borrowing and selling their belongings. 
The greatest arrears in wages have been registered by 
statistical organs in Tyumen Oblast (R60 billion), Krasnoyarsk 
Kray (R39 billion), Tatarstan (R35 billion), and Chelyabinsk 
Oblast (R32 billion), as well as Kemerovo, Saratov, Irkutsk, 
Sverdlovsk, Magadan, Volgograd, and other oblasts, and Altay 
Kray. 
  Wages delayed by 20 or more days account for almost 
three-quarters of the total amount. In many regions of Russia 
wages are not paid for two months. The greatest incidence of 
such occurrences is in the Central and Far Eastern regions. How 
can one live without money for two months? Do they understand 
this at Staraya Square and in the White House? I would propose 
this experiment: hold back salaries of members of the government 
for two months; perhaps then the urgency of the problem would be 
more clear to the powers that be. 
  There are, however, instances in which wages (or part of 
them) have been held back for three or even six months. Do we 
need to spell out who the workers of these enterprises voted 
for? All in all, 24,000 enterprises owe their workers back pay. 
Among the debtors are 5,000 enterprises in industry, 4,000 in 
construction, and 15,000 in agriculture (the state's 
indebtedness to agriculture is the greatest). 
  Now let us look at how the average wage has increased over 
the past year and how it was correlated with the rising prices 
for goods and services. For the year as a whole prices continued 
to lead this race; they increased at an anticipatory pace, but 
not by much. In my calculation, over 12 months the average wage 
increased 8.8-fold, and prices--9.4-fold. However, taking into 
account production decline in industry (16 percent) and cutbacks 
in for-pay services, the rise in wages is nevertheless excessive 
and does not correspond to the product produced. That is, on the 
whole Russians produced less and got paid more (even taking into 
account the inflation factor). Unearned money undoubtedly 
contributes to price rises. We will see more of it when the 
state pays off its debts.

  Another serious item to contemplate is the growing 
differentiation in wages. The gap between the average wages of 
the highest- and lowest-paid 10 percent of workers measured by 
the end of the year a factor of 27 (!)--no developed country has 
anything like this. Some were paid more than R1 million a month, 
while more than 1 million Russians got less than even the 
minimum wage (R14,620). In this respect the gap is measured by a 
factor of 100 or more. 
  With respect to per capita monetary income, one of the 
poorest is Ivanovo Oblast (R57,000), and one of the richest is 
Tyumen Oblast (R245,000). At the same time, among gas industry 
workers in Krasnoyarsk Kray the average per capita income in 
December amounted to no more no less than R2.4 million. Such an 
income policy only increases the danger of a social overheating 
of society.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX-SEGODNYA report: "The Russian Economy in the </F>
Beginning of 1994"] 
  [Text] According to the Russian Federation [RF] Goskomstat 
[State Committee for Statistics], in January Russian industry 
produced more than 15 trillion rubles' [R] worth of output in 
current prices. However, the physical volume of production 
continued to decline. As compared to the first month of last 
year, it declined in January by 23.1 percent. The total 
industrial output also declined considerably as compared to the 
level of December 1993--by 17.2 percent. 
  The volume of industrial production in Russia continues to 
slide unrestrainedly. According to RF Goskomstat data, in 
January 1994 it declined by 23.1 percent as compared to last 
year's January. The industrial output was 17.2 percent below 
that for December 1993. 
  While production in fuel and power generation sectors and 
nonferrous metallurgy declined by only 5-9 percent as compared 
to January 1993, in most processing sectors the scale of decline 
has been much greater. In light and food-processing industry 
production declined by 19-28 percent. 
  In the sectors producing producer goods, the scale of 
decline 
in the volume of production ranges from 23 percent in ferrous 
metallurgy to 28-35 percent in construction materials, chemical 
and petrochemical, and timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper 
industries, and 52 percent in machine building. 
  Nevertheless, the general trend toward shrinking production 
has not affected all sectors. For instance, the volume of gas 
production increased somewhat in January of this year (by 0.1 
percent) as compared to January 1993 and amounted to 57.2 
billion cubic meters. There was a 1-7 percent increase in the 
output of foundry machines, buses, refrigerators and freezers, 
and multipurpose kitchen machines. According to Goskomstat data, 
there were no flax-harvesting combines, forge-press machines 
with numeric program control, or magnetic tape produced in the 
first month of 1994. 
  Foodstuffs and consumer goods prices, as well as fees for 
consumer services in Russia, continued to rise in January. As 
reported by the RF Goskomstat, prices in the consumer market 
rose overall by 21.4 percent, including those for foodstuffs--by 
21.1 percent, nonfood items--by 12.5 percent, and for-fee 
services--by 73.8 percent. 
  In organized trade, the greatest price rises have been 
registered with respect to milk and milk products, bread and 
bakery items--by 34-35 percent, as well as eggs--by 23 percent. 
Prices for potatoes and vegetables rose by 22 percent. Prices 
for meat and meat products, cereals, and pasta items went up by 
15 percent. Sugar prices remained practically unchanged. 
  Among nonfood items in January the most significant price 
rise was registered with respect to sewn items (14.1 percent) 
and fuel sold to population (by 23.8 percent). Prices for 
gasoline rose over the month by more than 30 percent. As of 1 
February, one liter cost on average R228 (R179 in the end of 
December). 
  According to RF Goskomstat data, the cost of railroad 
transportation and communications services more than doubled in 
January. Apartment rents, and the cost of preschool care and 
health care services, increased by a factor of 1.5. 
  Prices for consumer services increased at a lesser rate--by 
20-30 percent. 
  The inflation rate over the period of 1-8 February measured 
at 3.3 percent. According to the data of the Center for Economic 
Trends under the Government of Russia, food prices rose over the 
week by 3.8 percent, for-fee services to the population--by 3.1 
percent, and prices for nonfood items--by 2.8 percent. 
  The highest rate of increases in consumer goods prices and 
fees for services was registered in the Far East--by 4.4 
percent, and the lowest in the Urals region--1.7 percent. 
  With respect to foodstuffs, the greatest increases were 
registered in prices for milk--by 9 percent, bread and 
vegetables--by 6 percent, and fish and butter--by 5 percent. 
Prices for vegetable oil, sugar, fruit, and vodka went up by 1 
percent. 
  The average cost of a monthly consumer basket of 19 most 
important foodstuffs as of 8 February amounted to R39,100. In 
Moscow the cost of this consumer basket was R43,800, and in St. 
Petersburg--R39,900. 
  With respect to nonfood items, the greatest increases were 
registered in the price of fuel--17 percent, medicines--by 5 
percent, and household and cultural purpose goods--by 4 percent. 
Prices for footwear and tobacco items changed the least.

articles] 
  [Text] Our time is truly unpredictable for 
long-suffering Russia. Each new day reveals new hotbeds of 
social tension. Miners, oil-field workers and gas-field workers 
are striking. A pre-strike state has been declared by textile 
and light industry workers and those of a number of other 
sectors. VUZ [higher educational institution] teachers and 
students have been pushed to the limit. What can be said about 
those who, through the actions of the stepfathers of reform, 
have long since found themselves to be in dire poverty? And they 
amount to no less than a third of the population! 
  So what now -- a global wave of protest capable, just 
like a tsunami, of destroying, once and for all, the foundations 
of stability and burying forever the hopes for economic and 
social revitalization? 
  "No!" declare commodity producers from a number of 
Russia's central and northwestern oblasts. A strike is not the 
way out of the situation. It just aggravates the situation. 
  Having combined their own efforts with the trade unions 
and drawn up a number of common urgent demands, they are 
proposing as the last civilized step a constructive dialog with 
the government and the president on steering the reforms into a 
creative channel. 
  And so -- the regions have spoken! 
  The government must respond by acting!

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Tokayev, president of the Ivanovo Oblast </F>
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and chairman of the 
Board of Directors of AO Kraneks Machine-Building Company: 
"Reforms for the People and not at Their Expense"] 
  [Text] Again, I must promulgate the basic points of the 
economic program being put forward by the Ivanovo Oblast Union 
of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. But that is just the way it 
is: we have still not received a proper reaction on the part of 
the government. This is why, with a feeling of complete 
solidarity, I am joining my colleagues from the neighboring 
oblasts and, once again, by taking action in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, 
I want to set forth the vision of the reforms from Russia's 
textile region. And currently a large machine-building center. 
  Our main principle in the realization of the economic 
policy, 
which must be followed, is extremely brief: reforms for the 
people and not at their expense. The reforms should improve the 
lives of all people who are ready to work honestly and not 
reduce them to total impoverishment. The reforms should be 
carried out through improvement of the organization of the 
country's national economy and not through devaluation of the 
citizens' money and exorbitant taxes on commodity producers. 
  What is decisively important for the Ivanovo Oblast's 
economy 
is the stabilization of the situation in the textile industry. 
In order to have this, first of all, it is necessary to solve 
the matters of supplying raw material at acceptable prices and 
selling the output at prices which would cover the average 
industry costs. 
  It would seem that everything is simple. But, in practice, 
we 
are running up against insurmountable barriers. The actions of 
government economists, which are aimed at pushing Uzbekistan and 
other cotton-growing republics out of the ruble domain, have 
sharply aggravated the situation in the textile industry. 
Extremely necessary are urgent intergovernmental agreements on 
the organization of a payment union between the republics and, 
what is most important, permanent monitoring of their 
implementation. 
  The following may be said with respect to the economic 
situation in the country: a policy, under which the production 
of the majority of goods becomes unprofitable and it is more 
worthwhile for the enterprises to stand idle than to operate, 
runs counter to the country's national interests. 
  The stabilization of the state's finances, about which they 
have been talking for more than a year now, is really the most 
important task. But, with unconditional priority given to the 
stabilization of production and the creation of new jobs. It is 
necessary to fight against inflation. But, given the current 
landslide decline in production, it is impossible to restrain 
inflation in principle, since the decline in production is not 
of a structural nature, but rather, of a general nature. It is 
necessary to extend the state's economic policy directly to the 
commodity producer. And, in order to do this, the federal organs 
of power must, without delay, implement a number of urgent 
measures. 
  The first item is taxes. Currently, with respect to the 
commodity producers, they exceed all reasonable limits. Such 
taxes are becoming nothing more than an economic noose. Over the 
millennia of the development of market relations, experience has 
proven that, in order for a commodity producer to produce goods 
and to support himself and the state, he should direct one-third 
of his income toward the development of production, keep 
one-third to himself for subsistence and give the remaining 
third to the state so that it could protect him from foreign and 
domestic foes, educate the children, develop the infrastructure, 
and so on. You will not think of anything new here and there is 
no need to do so. Deviations from this scheme do not produce any 
kinds of additional funds for the treasury, but only lead to the 
degradation of production, which is what we have at the present 
time. 
  This is why it is necessary to limit legislatively the 
maximum rate for all types of taxes and other obligatory 
payments from commodity producers to an overall level no higher 
than 35 percent. Likewise, it is necessary to exempt 
legislatively, without any stipulations, from taxation the 
profit directed by the commodity producers toward the 
replenishment of their working capital. 
  The second requirement involves the banks. It is currently 
absolutely clear to everyone that the confusion in the banking 
system is being deliberately maintained, since, with a discount 
rate of 210 percent or higher, it is an inexhaustible source of 
easy profit for sticky-fingered workers and, first and foremost, 
for those in the banking system itself. It is known that the 
larger the transmitted payment amount, the longer it goes 
through the banks, since it is a more dainty morsel for them. At 
the same time, it makes no difference how it is transmitted -- 
by telegraph or by mail. 
  Until such time that sanctions, which exceed by a minimum 
factor of 2 the possible dividends for delaying payments, are 
applied to all the banks, including the Central Bank, there will 
be no order there. 
  The third direction is investments. The state's current 
investment policy cannot be called anything other than suicidal. 
The fixed capital in industry is 70-80 percent worn out, while 
investments are practically nil. 
  Everyone remembers quite well that, in the not-too-distant 
past, the entire investment process in the country was provided 
through two sources: centralized and non-centralized, i.e., the 
enterprises' own resources. Today, for all practical purposes, 
the state has abandoned centralized capital investments, while 
the majority of enterprises does not have enough internal 
resources even to maintain current production and to pay wages. 
The investment total amounts to a big fat zero. Also, no one 
even dares think about credit, given the current bank interest 
rates. So it turns out that, given the current investment 
policy, industry is doomed to extinction. There is one way out 
-- exempt from taxation all the profit directed toward 
investments in production and also provide legislatively a 
special bank investment rate for credit for housing construction. 
  The prices for energy resources are another point. No one is 
about to refute the obvious truth that everything should cost 
what it costs. This is an axiom, without consideration of which 
a normal market and an effective economy cannot exist. But here 
we need to determine firmly just whose economy we are getting 
ready to help out of a crisis -- our own or the West's. If it is 
the West's, then we are on the right path. And, in this 
instance, it is really necessary to raise the prices for raw 
materials to the world level as quickly as possible. Domestic 
consumers will not be able to pay for them and all the raw 
materials will happily stream into the West at bargain prices. 
At the same time, our own industry will shut down -- here is 
your sales market for old imported stock! 
  However, if we firmly intend to help the Russian economy out 
of the crisis, then the main task of industrial policy today 
should be the creation of conditions for the stable production 
of domestic goods and the introduction of such legislative 
statutes as would motivate a commodity producer. 
  The stability of prices for primary energy resources plays a 
key role in the attainment of these goals. No one in the world 
has ever managed to stabilize an economy when the prices for 
energy resources keep jumping higher. Our position in this mater 
is unambiguous: the state should take it upon itself to regulate 
the prices for energy resources temporarily. 
  Specific demands on the government arose among the commodity 
producers in the implementation of economic ties with the 
republics which were part of the former [Soviet] Union and are 
currently sovereign states, as well as in the conducting of 
foreign trade policy. The thoughtlessly destroyed ties in the 
relations with the current CIS countries should be restored, 
while the artificially created barriers should be removed. 
Otherwise, for a long time to come, we will each separately be 
attempting unsuccessfully to create closed economic cycles. And 
this at a time when the capitalistic West is proceeding along 
the path of combining efforts. Is this not a paradox on our part? 
  There are the matters involving exporting and importing. For 
the time being, there is also a lot of confusion here, which is 
playing into the hands of the fanciers of easy profit. 
Meanwhile, the scheme is well-known: the export duties on raw 
material goods should bring the domestic prices for the exported 
raw materials into line with world prices, ensuring a reasonable 
standard of profit for the exporter and enriching the state 
budget. However, the import duties in turn are called upon to 
ensure the reasonable primacy of domestic commodity producers on 
the one hand and, on the other, to destroy monopolism and to 
create a competitive environment inside the country, while not 
serving as exclusively fiscal goals. Also unconditional should 
be a decision to exempt from customs duties imported 
manufacturing equipment and components for the production of 
competitive products.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Morozov, president of the Vologda </F>
Oblast Association of Industrial Enterprises and general manager 
of PO Vologda Experimental Machinery Plant: "Where the 
Government Is Leading Us Is a Big Secret"] 
  [Text] Our enterprise is one of those established to solve 
the problems of the military-industrial complex. The percentage 
of specialized state orders amounted in the association to 90 
percent. Compare this with its present volume -- 15 percent -- 
and it becomes clear what kind of abrupt transformation leap the 
collective has had to perform over the 3-year conversion period. 
  They did not act blindly, but according to a well-conceived 
plan. They chose for themselves several strategic directions, 
considering them priority ones for this period, and concentrated 
the collective's labor and creative potential on them. 
  And just what was the result? In order to respond to this 
question, let us analyze the situation which developed in 
production in chronological order. 
  We began with the production of drives for machine-building 
plants. It seemed worthwhile. The machine-tool builders of 
Ivanovo, Ryazan, Gorkiy, Izhevsk, Votkinsk and a number of other 
cities evaluated the worth of our products: the quality was not 
below that of the best world models, while the prices were much 
lower. We even went so far as to set up an SP [joint venture] 
with one of the West German firms. 
  However, the new manufacturing line soon turned out to be 
paralyzed: the customers did not have the money to pay for the 
orders. The promising production was stopped. 
  A similar fate also befell the second conversion direction 
-- 
the output of products for the agroindustrial complex and the 
emerging private farming. At first, our mini-bakeries, bakers' 
cabinets, equipment for making soft ice cream, mini-mills, 
mini-curers and many other things, which we had managed to 
master in short, record time frames, were a big success. But, as 
the saying goes, the music soon stopped. Because of the 
insolvency of the agrarians and also the disheartened farmers, 
it became necessary to curtail this production as well. 
  Our hopes rested on goods closely resembling basic types of 
products, but used for civilian purposes. There were binoculars 
and telescopes with day and night vision, sights for hunting 
rifles and the like. We also started producing mini-ATXs 
[automatic telephone exchange] for office equipment. Special 
plans were drawn up for the production of mini-GESs 
[hydroelectric power stations] with up to 10 kilowatts of 
capacity. Next would be mini-GESs with up to 50 kilowatts of 
capacity. It need hardly be said how important this equipment is 
for making up the energy shortage, especially on remote and 
nearly inaccessible farms. Such an installation can even fully 
supply a small village or farmstead. And on an ecologically 
clean basis. A small river or brook is sufficient in order to 
obtain the needed power. These products are especially promising 
for Central Asia, where there are a lot of streams with a large 
level difference. And orders for them began to come in. But 
alas, even this direction was not fated to survive on the crest 
of the reformers' experiments. The complicated political and, 
later, financial relations with the Union's former republics 
reduced to zilch the collective's highly promising plan. 
  No, no one will dare reproach us for inactivity or shirking 
when faced with difficulties. Even after so many reverses, we 
did not lose heart and continued to look for opportunities to 
rescue the enterprise's economic structure. Literally over 9 
months, we organized the production of complicated domestic 
equipment -- microwave ovens, vegetable dehydrators and the 
like. And we did this again on a world-class level -- since both 
the technical base and the skill of the specialists made it 
possible to achieve this. 
  However, the fanciers of "spillage and shrinkage" need not 
be 
alarmed: the new method was not fated to succeed. In any event, 
even this development of ours did not receive financial support. 
And thus, it was not developed further. 
  The circle, thus, is closed. It is becoming obvious that 
even 
ideas supported by serious marketing and solid technical 
studies, essentially sensible and very profitable for the 
national economy are not fated to be realized under current 
conditions. Is it worth talking here about the shortcomings of 
one enterprise or another, if enterprising initiative itself is 
doomed to failure? 
  Unclaimed products worth 1.5 billion rubles are currently 
sitting in our enterprise's warehouses. All of them are intended 
for the civilian market. There is a demand for all of them. The 
consumer lacks only one thing -- the means to pay for these 
articles. 
  Naturally, this is driving the producers to their knees. The 
average wage at our enterprise, despite the high technical and 
professional level, is lower than that for Vologda Oblast. As a 
result, an outflow of personnel has begun to show up. And those 
who leave, as a rule, are not the worst. Of course, we are 
trying by every means possible to check this alarming process. 
We are introducing, for example, a contract wage rate system, 
including even among the rank-and-file workers. We are setting 
up personal merit salaries, especially for those who work on a 
time-rate basis. But can the manager and the chief accountant 
afford to pay a lot, if the enterprise does not have a plus 
balance? Yet, any owner of a commercial shop can simply "draw" a 
salary to protect his own "point," at a level exceeding that of 
a plant by a factor of 3-4. Not everyone can resist this 
temptation, especially if there is a family or children to 
support. 
  What particularly alarms us are the unneeded areas which we 
are now trying to rent out. But there is hardly much saved if, 
during the so-called "special period," we are obliged to 
maintain a specified potential. No one disputes the fact that 
the defense industry is the defense industry. And it should hold 
something in reserve. But why should these funds be added to the 
production cost of the products, including civilian ones? They 
need simply to be set aside. 
  What way out do we, the workers of the converted 
enterprises, 
see? 
  I will state it directly: no one is thinking about 
retreating. It is clear that it is necessary to go forward. And 
also along the path of the further development of strategic 
directions, only now for peaceful products. Well, let us assume 
that, jointly with the Podolsk plant, we set up production of 
the Dialog Sewing Machine. This edge-overstitch machine is in 
great demand. We are thinking about setting up another whole 
series of production lines. It is quite possible that even the 
enterprise itself will undergo changes in its organizational 
structure. This will no longer be an association [obyedineniye], 
but rather, for example, a holding company or a holding concern. 
To put it briefly, we will try out and incorporate everything 
which is more viable and which will produce a maximum output. 
One thing is alarming in this connection: we do not know the 
government's policy -- both in matters of conversion and in the 
development of Russia's economy as a whole. Up till now, 
priorities have not been set either for military doctrine or for 
civilian directions. 
  Meanwhile, we, the commodity producers, are supposed to know 
firmly, which course of economic activities is being supported 
by the state, in which one it is possible to obtain help and 
assistance and in which one only one's own forces can be counted 
on. And if a labor collective selected for itself a priority 
path for the development of the economic structure, it should be 
confident that the state would not leave it to deal with 
problems on its own. 
  Finally, it is necessary to explain clearly to people at the 
highest level: what are the reforms we are carrying out -- 
problems which need to be solved or goals, toward which we need 
to strive? For the time being, however, we are hearing only one 
thing from the leaders of the government: they do not intend to 
retreat from the reforms. But, after all, this says nothing at 
all! 
  If we want to obtain from conversion not just broken-down 
military-industrial complex enterprises, which is what is 
happening now, but rather, technically advanced plants geared 
toward the production of products which are the most advanced 
and necessary for the national economy, then it is necessary to 
steer this conversion into the appropriate channel and not let 
it drift in accordance with the principle: sink or swim.

<F P=106> [Articleby Yuriy Borodin, chairman of the Yaroslavl Oblast's </F>
Economic Council and general manager of AO Machine Instruments: 
"To Swindle or To Stop Working?"] 
  [Text] I would not want our newspaper action through 
RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA to look like a political act. Everything is 
full of politics as it is. At the same time, there has been 
almost no illumination of the country's economic state. People 
know very little about what is going on at a neighboring 
enterprise, not to mention in another city or oblast. But 
everyone perceives perfectly well the negative consequences of 
the reforms if they affect him personally. That is, the majority 
of us does not know the overall situation in the country and the 
tendencies of its further development. We are suffering in 
isolation. 
  It is high time to think together, how to live on. But, 
first, a small analysis of what has occurred with the 
reformation of the economy over the last 3 years. And not with 
the reforms in general, but rather, with their main component, 
which has been called upon to ensure the life of commodity 
production. 
  Being noticeably carried out are just two standard 
procedures 
for introducing a market economy -- privatization and financial 
and tax transactions. But how are they proceeding? If you take 
the privatization process, only one of its stages is being 
implemented at an intensified pace -- the political stage. A 
change in the property owner is occurring. The second stage, 
however, the stage of economic privatization, has not yet begun 
and, in my opinion, is not being planned. The discussions about 
the fact that the secondary issuing of shares, the funds from 
which will be directed toward the development of production and 
will help the market transformations, are groundless. 
  The main question is -- who will buy the enterprises' 
shares? 
Who will acquire them? And it is answered with the help of a 
concentrated advertising campaign based on one scenario -- to 
take available money from people and put it not into commodity 
production, but rather, into the so-called "buy-sell" 
transactions. That is, at the present time, the purchasing of 
the enterprises' shares for the purpose of stabilizing 
production has, for all practical purposes, been excluded. And 
if someone talks about this, then this is the same kind of 
deception as the one that, for a voucher invested in an 
investment fund, it is possible to receive some inconceivable 
interest rates. A source for the development of commodity 
production through a change in the owner is thus excluded. 
Privatization is not fulfilling its basic function. 
  The credit, financial and tax policies being pursued by the 
government exclude both the second and third basic sources of 
financing and development of the economy -- credits and profits. 
The so-called financial stabilization begun in June of last year 
has led to the most negative consequences for the commodity 
producers. First, the enterprises' working capital was not 
indexed and all the promises in this regard on the part of 
several government components just remained empty phrases. And, 
for the plants and factories, the working capital is the same 
thing as wages for people. And, since the prices for raw 
materials and energy resources rose by a factor of 1,000 and 
more, while the working capital remained frozen at the level of 
January, 1992, it is clear that a production crisis was 
inevitable. This is precisely the main reason for the 
non-payments in all spheres of commodity production. 
  There is no sense at all in talking about profit as a source 
of life support for the commodity producers. The state has set 
up such taxes that, for all practical purposes, the enterprises' 
entire revenues are being taken away. Yet, indeed, it is well 
known that, in any confiscatorial system, there is an optimum 
limit which, when crossed, does not lead to an increase in 
payments into the treasury, but, rather, confronts the 
entrepreneurs with two questions: to swindle or to cease 
activities. Which is what is happening in our country: small 
structures are concealing profits from taxes and the large ones, 
for whom this is more complicated, are shutting down. 
  Yes, there are commercial organizations which are making 
money even under these conditions. But this capital has also 
been cut away from commodity production. It is not profitable 
under present conditions for a single commercial bank to invest 
funds in production, since they will not produce quick and 
significant revenues. Hence follows the conclusion that a split 
has occurred between financial and industrial capital, which is 
increasing with every passing day. Money has become expensive 
and inaccessible for commodity producers and there is constant 
competition for it, but the outcome has been automatically 
predetermined to the disadvantage of the commodity producers. 
  The conclusion is unambiguous: the transformations carried 
out in the country have led to the opposite result, a landslide 
drop in commodity production, and have threatened the very 
existence of the nation and the state. 
  An especially difficult situation has taken shape in the 
production lines which determine the technical level of the 
produced goods. In electronics, instrument making and the 
machine-tool industry, the slump is around 50 percent, it is 
more than 45 percent in the chemical industry, it is also 50 
percent in light industry and more than 40 percent in the 
production of meat and milk protein. It is necessary to add to 
this the fact that, everywhere, the number of employed people is 
declining, giving rise to more and more new waves of 
unemployment. It is not necessary to be a big economist in order 
to arrive at the conclusion: what is occurring are the 
de-industrialization of the national economic structure and its 
conversion into a raw materials base for other countries. 
  Yaroslavl Oblast has always been notable for the stability 
of 
its situation and the carefully weighed nature of its decisions, 
but even it has not become an exception. The rate of the slump 
in production for some sectors in our oblast is even higher than 
that of our neighbors. The instances of enterprises being shut 
down have become more frequent. Not working a full week has 
become a common occurrence. 
  As per a report of 1 February, 65 percent of the oblast's 
enterprises were either shut down or working according to a 
shortened schedule. Hidden unemployment exceeded 16.5 percent of 
the labor force. 
  Light industry is almost at a standstill. The conversion 
enterprises are in a most difficult situation. Destruction of 
the agrarian sector is occurring. The financial situation of the 
majority of plants and factories is critical. 
  What kinds of measures need to be adopted? 
  I will tell you right out: we have divided them into three 
levels. The first is one which depends on the enterprises and 
labor collectives themselves. What has been concealed is the 
fact that not everyone clearly understands the special features 
of working under market conditions, including people in our 
management team. 
  The second level of requirements is the level of the region. 
If a large portion of the taxes remains at the disposal of the 
local organs of power, then, naturally, it is also necessary to 
decide the matters of their efficient use here, locally, taking 
into consideration the interests of all sections of the people. 
The logic is simple: if the enterprises do not survive, then 
there will be nothing to support the budget-controlled workers. 
  However, the third item is quite obvious: the first two 
directions will produce positive results only when the necessary 
foundation for the reforms is provided at the federal level. The 
president and the government should such rules of the game as 
would be advantageous for the commodity producer and motivate 
him to work efficiently.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Production Drop at All </F>
Enterprises"] 
  [Text] The work of the majority of the Vladimir Oblast's 
enterprises has been paralyzed, including at such large ones as 
the tractor plant, Tochmash [precision machinery], Elektropribor 
[electrical instrument], Tekhnika [equipment], the Kovrov Plant 
imeni Degtyarev, and the Murom Radio Plant. 
  A drop in production volume in 1993 was noted at enterprises 
with all forms of ownership and in all sectors. The most 
complicated situation over the course of the year persisted in 
the light, chemical and fuel sectors, where the decline amounted 
to 31-37 percent. The production of cotton cloth was curtailed 
by half, of footwear by 51 percent, of linen cloth by 29 percent 
and of knitted wear by 34 percent. 
  Of the sectors of the machine-building complex, the greatest 
lag behind the 1992 level was noted in the machine-tool and 
instrument industy --by 32.9 percent. 
  There is a complicated situation in the military-industrial 
complex, in which every fifth oblast enterprise is engaged. The 
state indebtedness for goods produced here exceeds 35 billion 
rubles [R]. The average wage at these types of enterprises is 
15-20 percent lower than that for the machine-building industry 
on the whole. 
  There was a sharp increase in lost work time in connection 
with the protracted production stoppages. Their percentage 
increased from 8 percent in the first quarter to 17 percent in 
the fourth quarter. The overall losses of work time for the 
oblast last year amounted to 5.5 million man-days. 
  The payment indebtedness for the oblast's enterprises on 1 
December amounted to R249.8 billion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The State Is Obligated To Settle Up </F>
with the Village"] 
  [Text] The volume of industrial production in 1993 
decreased in comparison with the previous year by 14.5 percent. 
This includes the 16.9 percent decrease in December. In the 
sectors geared toward the consumer market, the reduction in the 
output of industrial products amounted to 7.4 percent. 
  At defense complex enterprises which are implementing 
conversion, the decline in production in comparison with 1992 
was 40 percent. 
  The non-payment crisis led in December to the total or 
partial shutdown of 58 of the oblast's industrial enterprises. 
  There is a complicated situation in the agroindustrial 
complex. An increase in the production of individual types of 
agricultural products was provided in the past year solely 
through private subsidiary plots, while, in the public sector, 
the decline is continuing to increase. Cattle raising is being 
curtailed. Enhancement of the land's fertility has been stopped. 
The extent of deterioration of the machine and tractor fleet 
amounts to 80 percent. 
  The program for the revitalization of the Russian 
countryside 
is not being carried out. New housing starts in the village have 
been cut back and there has been curtailment of the construction 
of cattle-raising accomodations and cultural and consumer 
facilities.

<F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA writer Irina Sabvateyeva: "A London </F>
Professor on the Standard of Living in Russia"] 
  [Text] Richard Laird, a professor at the London 
School of Economics, in conjunction with specialists of the Work 
Center for Economic Reforms under the Government of Russia, has 
done a study of the standard of living of Russians. His approach 
to the problem turned out to be somewhat nontraditional. 
<H5>  Are We Poor? Or Perhaps Not So Poor? </H5>
  According to Professor Laird's calculations, with the 
average 
wage at the end of 1993 it was possible to buy 83 percent of 
what could have been acquired for similar wages in 1985. But in 
general at the end of last year Russians had about 90 percent of 
their 1985 income. 
  But this overall, quite pleasant picture was significantly 
adjusted by the figures that characterize social stratification. 
The difference between the "average" and that 10 percent of the 
population who occupy the lower rung of the income ladder is 
growing. While in 1991 the latter had 52 percent of the average 
income, by the end of 1993 they were left with only 40 percent. 
At the same time, in Mr. Laird's opinion, this spread in the 
incomes is comparable to the degree of stratification that is 
observed in Great Britain. 
  And another curious tendency: In 1993 we managed to reduce 
the proportion of Russians living in poverty. 
<H5>  The Reasons for Inequality: Discovery Laird Style </H5>
  The London professor thinks that the reasons for the 
stratification in Russia are the difference in earnings and the 
nonpayment of wages. He categorically disagrees with the 
widespread opinion in Russia that the poor system of social 
protection of the underprivileged also contributes to this. Here 
are Mr. Laird's thoughts. 
  The pension? But the ratio between the average pension and 
the average wage last year was the same as in 1985. And 12 
percent higher than in 1992. 
  Stipends for children? There is no doubt that this is the 
most important element in the system of social protection. Since 
there are more Russian children in poverty than Russian 
pensioners. But by the end of last year this indicator was 
higher than in 1985. True, the situation deteriorated this 
January. As a result of the indexation of the minimum wage 
conducted in December, the amounts of stipends relative to wages 
decreased. And now they are somewhere around the level of world 
standards. 
  Unemployment compensation? It is indeed low. But it is quite 
comparable to our minimum wage. And it amounts to approximately 
10 percent of the average wage. Undoubtedly it is less than the 
unemployment compensation in any other country of the world. But 
our level of unemployment is not high--1.4 percent of the entire 
work force. 
  Incidentally, the professor categorically disagrees with the 
idea that the actual level of unemployment in Russia is much 
higher than the official one. According to his figures, we have 
an increase in the number of people employed in the financial 
sphere, the system of social protection, and trade. 
  Moreover, last year many enterprises tried to avoid mass 
firing. They did this for two reasons. First, out of social 
considerations. Second, it was advantageous for the managers to 
keep many workers but pay them little. Since high taxes are 
imposed on high earnings. 
<H5>  A Unique Way of Fighting Unemployment? </H5>
  Quite possibly, thinks Mr. Laird. This method consists in 
that the people do not lose their final connection with the 
enterprise until they have a new job. They go on unpaid or 
partially paid leave and work a partial work week. 
  To be sure, the London professor does not agree with the 
assessments of this phenomenon made by certain Russian 
researchers. Here is what he says: 
  "I decided to verify the following assertion: `During the 
past 10 months, 5 percent of the workers were on partially paid 
leave.' And what did I find out? This leave lasted an average of 
23 days a year. But this means that a total of only 0.7 percent 
of the work force was on this kind of leave during the year. 
This figure is not very large." 
  In the opinion of the Englishman, the Russian "humane"--as 
he 
christened it--means of fighting unemployment will be effective 
only when a personnel retraining system is in place. But up to 
now very little has been done in Russia to prepare people for 
new occupations. This is the circumstance that Richard Laird 
considers to be "the greatest failure of the reforms."

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Ivanovich Baranov, convicted </F>
counterfeiter, by Oleg Karmaz; date and place not given: "King 
of the Counterfeiters"] 
  [Text] Allow me to introduce you to a genius, a criminal 
genius--a man who served his full term in the "zone"--12 years. 
This self-taught man once led the whole Soviet militia on a 
merry chase. 
  They say that when he was arrested, former USSR Minister of 
Internal Affairs N.A. Shchelokov immediately reported the arrest 
personally to L.I. Brezhnev. That is how notorious 
"Counterfeiter Number One" was at that time. 
  After President Ivan Barbot of Interpol had taken a good 
look 
at Viktor Baranov's "products," he tersely remarked: "If your 
country does not join Interpol, you will be ruined...." 
  We did not hear anything about him for a long time. We heard 
that he was "doing time," and that was all. His name was not 
mentioned in the press, and people tried not to discuss him. It 
was as if he was a top-security nuclear physicist. 
  Some of the events of our daily life, however, did evoke 
some 
mention of him. These were news items that were not particularly 
pleasant to hear--especially for the scrupulous Central Bank 
staff. I am referring to the recent official announcements of a 
mass epidemic of counterfeiting in Russia. 
  Counterfeit banknotes, primarily 50,000-ruble bills, are 
"surfacing" everywhere--in bank branches, stores, and in markets 
(one of these, incidentally, even reached the bookkeepers in our 
editorial offices). Some of them are ordinary xerox copies, but 
some others have all the earmarks of hand-crafted items. We have 
learned that the new Russian rubles have almost no protective 
features (experts, incidentally, did issue cautionary warnings 
about this), and that their duplication is an easy and 
rudimentary task. 
  It was rumored that Viktor Baranov had been asked to serve 
as 
a consultant to Goznak [State Bank Notes, Coins, and Medals 
Administration]. They say he was asked to do this by his 
namesake, Central Bank Chairman of the Board Viktor 
Gerashchenko, and that the "king of the counterfeiters" is now 
in the government's good graces. 
  "That is utterly absurd," Viktor Ivanovich snapped 
at the very start of our conversation. "No one ever asked me to 
do anything or suggested that I do anything. The people there, 
in Goznak, would turn up their noses at the very thought. They 
see me as a criminal, a convict--in general, an unsalvageable 
man. Meanwhile, for some reason, no matter how much they try, 
they cannot make authentic banknotes. But I can, and I could 
devise a currency that no one could ever copy." 
  [Karmaz] If they did invite you, would you go there? 
  [Baranov] Without question. The sight of today's money is 
painful to me: It is so flimsy. It does not even feel like 
money, and it does not command any respect. Money has to look 
like money and have a commanding design. I could create that 
kind of currency. I promise I could! Evidently, however, that 
will never be. 
  [Karmaz] At one time you made bills that were virtually 
indistinguishable from real money. Furthermore, from what I have 
heard, you printed them in a shed, with equipment you built 
yourself. 
  [Baranov] Why do you say "virtually"? They were completely 
indistinguishable from the originals! Even under a microscope. 
This was true of the 50- and 100-ruble bills. It is true that I 
stopped making them after a while. They were boring. My 25-ruble 
bills had a tiny "glitch." You might call it a trademark. There 
was just one irregularity in one of the thousands of links of 
the protective grid on the back of the note. This one link on my 
bill tilted upward just slightly. That was all. Everything else 
was exactly the same--as if in a mirror. 
  As for the equipment, I had my own Goznak in the shed, and I 
hope you will not take this as an idle boast. Of course it was 
only a tiny fraction of the real Goznak's size, but this was not 
a problem--it is just what I wanted. Why take the trouble of 
building a press the size of a three-story building if one no 
bigger than a television set will do exactly the same thing? 
  [Karmaz] As a nonprofessional, I would think that the 
watermark would be the most difficult part of the process. Then 
there would be the problems of copying the design, the colors, 
and so forth. Am I right? 
  [Baranov] In principle, yes, although all of the stages are 
difficult. I can tell you that I spent 3.5 years getting the 
watermark right, and the colors took another 2.5 years, although 
I did come up with the press right away. I remember that the 
investigators asked me to conduct an experiment and print a bill 
in the inspector's office. All of the generals and all of the 
"bigwigs" from Moscow came to see this: No one could believe 
that money could be printed with equipment taking up no more 
space than two writing desks. The first thing I did was to print 
the watermark, Lenin's profile. After that, just for fun, I 
printed the design of one side of the bill on ordinary paper 
from the inspector's desk instead of on "currency-grade" paper. 
There was no more doubt. The experts wrote that my forgeries 
represented an "exceptional danger to society." And they gave me 
12 years, although they certainly could have given me a lighter 
sentence. 
  [Karmaz] You have suggested that you "cooperated fully and 
voluntarily with the investigators." 
  [Baranov] What would you call it? I told them everything, I 
showed them everything, and I explained everything. I even 
refused the services of an attorney. I figured that I had been 
caught, and now I had to pay for the crime. 
  [Karmaz] That sounds so virtuous. 
  [Baranov] There was nothing virtuous about it! I am not an 
angel. If you do something wrong, you have to suffer the 
consequences. But this case.... The prosecution asked for 12.5 
years, and the judges "were lenient" and sentenced me to 12. But 
enough about that. It happened and now it is over. 
  [Karmaz] But what made you set up this underground Goznak? 
Was it the thrill of taking risks? 
  [Baranov] It was just something I had to prove to myself. I 
wanted to see if I could do something that was supposed to be 
absolutely impossible. The experts at the hearing said that no 
one before me or after had even come close to what I had done. 
  The whole thing started this way. When I got out of the 
army--I was serving in Germany--I came back home just when the 
currency reform began, in 1961. When I looked at the new crisp 
rubles, believe it or not, my heart began to pound. It was as if 
I were looking at "La Gioconda." The bills were beautiful, like 
fine works of art. The design on the 25-ruble bill was 
particularly striking. It was elaborate, imaginative.... In 
short, it was a feast for the eyes. 
  I decided to copy the design. I tried tracing it, but under 
a 
microscope I saw that the drawing consisted of several 
layers--one on top of the other. Some of the lines could only be 
seen when they were magnified 60-80 times. I went to the local 
library and took out all the books I could find on engraving, 
printing, and plating. I had a sense that these were not enough. 
I was still only an ignorant dilettante at that time. I went to 
Moscow, to the Lenin Library. I remember looking through 
Professor Sinikov's "The Production of Engraved Printing 
Plates," Berezin's "Printing Materials," and a couple of other 
books. After I had read them, I realized that I would have to 
have copies of my own. I had to "borrow" them from the Lenin 
Library. 
  In general, I started with the fundamentals and learned 
everything I could. Then I began developing my own printing 
methods. I designed miniature machine tools and presses and 
developed solutions and dyes. Everything fit into a small shed. 
No one could have suspected anything. The only clue was that my 
neighbors suffered brief power lapses when I began working. 
  [Karmaz] In the case file I read your statement that money 
could also be printed by another method, a completely different 
method from the one you used. 
  [Baranov] I told the investigators at that time: Give me 
three years, and I will come up with an even simpler method of 
printing currency. It will not call for any gigantic 
institutions like Goznak, all types of scientific research 
institutes, and so forth. I was already planning to build a 
machine in my shed. I had made some notes. I wanted to put the 
raw material into one side of the machine, push a button, and 
then take the finished bills out of the other side. 
  [Karmaz] But that sounds like science fiction. 
  [Baranov] Why science fiction? I had already made all of the 
calculations. I am not a naive theorist, after all. I am a 
craftsman, and an exacting one. In general, they told me: Just 
try to design anything of the kind. 
  [Karmaz] But how did they catch you? After all, for a long 
time all of the investigators and security personnel thought 
that this was the work of a large gang of counterfeiters--around 
50 or 100 people. They were looking for you for a long time. 
From what I heard, all of Russia was divided into sectors, 
depending on the number of your "products" in circulation there. 
All Goznak personnel without exception were under suspicion. And 
all of this was futile. Was it really just a fluke that you were 
caught? 
  [Baranov] Of course.... I usually got rid of most of my 
bills 
in the marketplace in Cherkessk, about 100-120 kilometers from 
here, from Stavropol. All of the cashiers, clerks, and private 
vendors in the markets had been warned, it goes without saying, 
that a man with a large sum of money might come there to 
exchange bills on the sly. On 12 April, right on Space 
Exploration Day, at around three in the afternoon, they caught 
me. A kolkhoz farmer in the marketplace saw me exchanging bills 
and "alerted" the militia, and things went on from there. 
  [Karmaz] I heard that the kolkhoz farmer was later granted a 
private audience with Shchelokov and was awarded an engraved 
watch for "vigilant action leading to the apprehension of a 
particularly dangerous criminal." 
  [Baranov] I know, I know. So what? Maybe he deserved it. 
  They drove me to Stavropol, where all of the militia 
personnel and officials were already waiting for me. 
Incidentally, the whole interrogation and all of the pre-trial 
experiments were taped. The tape was later shown, they told me, 
to L.I. Brezhnev among others. I do not know what he said about 
me, and I did not really care that much. 
  When the interrogation began, I was asked, as I already 
said, 
to print just one bill. I told them what kind of reagents and 
paper I needed and asked them to bring me my confiscated 
equipment. That was the start of an elaborate charade: I would 
ask them, for instance, for vitriol, and they would bring me 
cyanide. I would ask for lead oxide, and they would bring barium 
oxide. They were trying to find out if I really understood what 
I was doing. Later, they acknowledged that I knew just what I 
was doing.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Maryasov: "A Landslide Reduction in </F>
Fertility"] 
  [Text] Russian fields expect a landslide reduction in 
fertility in the next few years, unless the state takes over the 
financing of agrochemical work. 
  Not long ago I had occasion to attend an All-Russian seminar 
conference of agrochemical workers. The speakers said with alarm 
that the erosion of nutrients from the soil had increased 
considerably (Table No 1). We are taking all the sap from the 
land, and giving it nothing in return. This can have only a 
deplorable ending. In two or three years such a landslide 
reduction in the production of agricultural products will set in 
that no loans and no infusions from the West will help.

  V. Ivanova, director of the Velikiye Luki Chemization 
Station 
in Pskov Oblast, was one of the first to speak at the seminar. 
  "The conditions for agricultural development in the oblast 
are very difficult," said Valentina Fedorovna. "Poor soil, lack 
of roads, depopulated villages -- these are the characteristic 
features of our region. Hopes that we would have a normal life 
appeared in 1981-1982, when road construction and land 
improvement were firmly undertaken. In these years, the 
intensity of agrochemical service picked up. For example, high 
rates of liming made it possible to reduce the soil acidity from 
60 to 30 percent. One could say that the land took a deep 
breath. The best farms began to obtain 20 quintals of grain from 
each hectare, and 200 quintals of potatoes. This did not last 
long, unfortunately. Gradually, all the good beginnings began to 
be reduced to nothing. In the last year or two, the Pskov rural 
area, I can say without exaggeration, has been approaching the 
critical line. 
  "You know, everything begins with the land, but our land has 
found itself neglected. The placement of mineral fertilizers has 
dropped by a factor of eight, as compared with the 1980's, of 
organic fertilizers -- by a factor of three, and four-fold fewer 
fields are being limed. Things are coming to the point where 
soon a nutritive element such as potassium will not remain in 
the soil. 
  "The amount of acidic soil is increasing. We can go back to 
the days when the acidity was such that no crops grew: barley 
would sprout and immediately die. Now we are approaching the 
same point: what we accumulated by granules for 30 years we ran 
off in two to three years. 
  "The Pskov farmers obtained a 40-million-ruble [R] loan this 
year to purchase mineral fertilizers. In other words, there were 
R100 per hectare of plowed land. What can you buy for that? This 
is not a loan, but a mockery. 
  "The financial situation of many farms is catastrophic. 
Things have come to the point where it has become more 
profitable not to cultivate the land than it is to cultivate it. 
The expenses to grow flax at the farms are more than the flax 
mills pay for it. They say that we used to have a ridiculous 
economy, but what we have come to does not fit into even this 
concept." 
  Valentina Fedorovna also came out with a specific proposal: 
agrochemical work should be financed by the state. The farms 
cannot buy fertilizers at the existing prices. The farmers are 
also turning to the agrochemical service for help. They have 
many problems, and there must be interaction. When you ask the 
farmers about paying for the services, though, each one shrugs 
his shoulders: "What payment?! I have nothing but debts, and 
this is the third year that I haven't had a penny of income." 
  This is the sort of speech you have. It is hard not to agree 
with many of the arguments. At the same time, however, one feels 
like arguing. What is easy to come by is not so highly valued. 
Not so long ago, fertilizers arrived at the farms as if from a 
horn of plenty, and moreover, were very cheap. So? We all 
remember their being scattered on the borders of the fields, in 
the gullies, torn sacks and incompetent storage, when they 
poured what should have been separated into the same heap. 
  As we know, the doses of fertilizer placement are closely 
tied into the reserves of nutrients in the soil, a fact which 
agronomists often disregard. There was a time when many 
specialists acted blindly, on the principle of "we take a 
measure from the embankment, and then we sort it out." The soil 
on their farm remained a thoroughly hidden mystery to them. Now, 
true, most of the farms have agrochemical charts. Consequently, 
there is a possibility of forming a norm for the placement of 
fertilizers according to the needs of the plants in each field. 
  Not everything depends on the charts, though, there are two 
sides to the coin. In this case the second side concerns the 
technical outfitting of the farms. Over ten years ago, science 
worked out a local method for placing fertilizers. To this day, 
however, the peasants have not received the equipment for this 
and are forced to use machines with a centrifugal sifting 
apparatus to place fertilizers. The lack of uniformity in 
placing fertilizers in this case reaches three- or four-fold the 
normal value. The consequence? A tremendous overexpenditure of 
fertilizers and an increase, on some sections of the fields, in 
the nutrient dose, as compared with the recommended one. 
  This means that the problem is far from ambiguous. A simple 
"let it be" will not do very well here. Competent chemization of 
agriculture is transforming the rural area, that is 
indisputable. In the developed countries, however, the means of 
chemizing and protecting plants merges with new technology. The 
yield that comes from this can be judged by the published table 
(Table 2).

<F P=106> [Interview with A.P. Spirin, senior scientific associate of </F>
the All-Russian Mechanization Institute, doctor of Agricultural 
Sciences, professor, written down by I. Kalashnikov: "We Have 
Conquered Erosion"] 
  [Text] This marks the 40th year since the start of 
developing virgin and fallow lands. Whatever the evaluations of 
this major national economic program, there is undoubtedly one: 
putting into circulation vast, formerly unused, arable land made 
a weighty addition of grain in the country's food product 
balance. The approaching anniversary, therefore, deserves to be 
noted on a broad scale. Our newspaper, too, proposes to publish 
a number of items on this subject. 
  Today A.P. Spirin, senior scientific associate of the 
All-Russian Mechanization Institute, doctor of Agricultural 
Sciences, professor, tells us about the solution to one of the 
very important problems--developing anti-erosion equipment, 
without which all the efforts of the virgin soil subjugators 
might have lost their value. 
  Anatoliy Petrovich noted: At the beginning of the 1950's, 
our 
country had vast areas of arable land, unused for a number of 
reasons. This land was not only in Kazakhstan, where there were 
many million hectares of virgin land (it was thought to be 
mainly low-efficiency saline soil, and therefore was not 
plowed). There were quite a few unplowed territories in Western 
and Eastern Siberia, in Altay and in the Volga area, even on the 
Kuban and in Rostov Oblast. 
  Calculations and estimates showed that these lands were over 
20 million hectares in area. If an average of at least ten 
quintals of grain per hectare were harvested, this promised an 
addition of 20 million tonnes of grain a year. This would, of 
course, be a major reserve for the production of grain, the 
shortage of which we were already beginning to feel. 
  The country's government therefore devoted major attention 
to 
accelerated development of the virgin land. A great deal of 
agricultural equipment was sent to Kazakhstan and to the eastern 
regions, and thousands of machine operators went there. The epic 
being lived through by the entire country began. 
  As far back as on the eve of developing these lands, expert 
agrarian scientists gave notice in advance: the virgin land must 
not be plowed with ordinary equipment -- there was a danger of 
wind erosion. Here they alluded to the bitter experience of 
countries such as the United States and Canada, which had 
experienced the serious consequences of the dust storms of the 
1930's. The only way to avoid misfortune was to use 
non-terracing tilling of the soil in the steppe regions, where 
strong winds blow. While traditional -- terrace -- plowing 
deprives the earth of the protective plant covering, 
non-terracing plowing keeps the stubble plant remnants on the 
surface, which ensures reliable wind-erosion protection of the 
soil. 
  World experience attested to this and taught this and also 
the fact that a subsurface cultivator and other anti-erosion 
equipment should be used instead of a plow. Unfortunately, we 
did not have this equipment. We therefore had to till the earth 
with ordinary machines in the early days. Fortunately, at first 
we got by without dust storms. They soon made their presence 
known, however. 
  The scientific institutions of those days, VASKhNIL 
[All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences imeni V.I. Lenin], 
including VIM [All-Union Agricultural Mechanization Scientific 
Research Institute] and, in particular, our Department of 
Agricultural Soil Protection Mechanization, worked persistently 
on developing, in the shortest time possible, the machines and 
implements that the virgin soil tillers needed. We all succeeded 
in achieving the task successfully. 
  KPG-250, KPG-2-150 and KPP-2-2 type subsurface cultivators 
were among the first implements built. They were quite simple 
implements. What are they like? If you make a diagram, it is two 
blades, placed at an angle (the so-called aperture angle, equal 
to 110-120 degrees) and a post in the middle. Moreover, the 
blades are slanted toward the plane of the earth -- this is the 
crumbling angle or cutting angle. They made it possible to till 
the soil to a depth of 25-27 centimeters, with a 1.5-2-meter 
swath width. The special feature of the subsurface cultivator 
lies in the fact that using them does not turn over the earth, 
as occurs when plowing with a plow, and causes virtually no 
destruction to the upper interwoven layer of the root system. 
This, I repeat, protects the soil from wind erosion. 
  In addition to the subsurface cultivators, a number of other 
machines were developed, which took into consideration the 
specific nature and special features of non-terracing 
technology. These are: the KSh rod weeder, the BI-3 toothed 
harrow, stubble drills and snow plows. In all, the set of 
anti-erosion equipment included 11 new descriptions of machines 
and implements. VIM scientific associates A. Plishkin, V. 
Trufanov and N. Ivanov did a great deal of fruitful work on 
developing them in those years. The work was done with the 
active participation of specialists of the design bureau of the 
Odessa Agricultural Machine Plant imeni October Revolution. 
Incidentally, it was at this same plant, which specializes in 
the production of plows, that subsurface cultivators and other 
means of mechanization for virgin land workers were developed 
and produced for the first time. 
  At the same time, of course, foreign experience was taken 
into consideration. There was no mere copying of foreign 
equipment here, though. For instance, the American subsurface 
cultivator was designed for fine tilling of the soil -- only 
12-15 centimeters. In our country, considering the specific 
nature of our soils, we hold the opinion: the deeper, the 
better. Therefore we developed implements with deep tilling, 
twice as deep as the American ones. 
  Furthermore, in those years the United States used wheeled 
tractors, whereas we used mainly caterpillar tractors. Their 
tractor-mounted implements could not be unitized with our 
caterpillar tractors, which the designers also took into 
consideration. 
  What can be said about the first-generation anti-erosion 
machines? They were quite efficient, workable equipment, which 
was widely used in various regions of the country. It made it 
possible to introduce a soil-protection system of farming on an 
area of over 20 million hectares, that is, on virtually all the 
virgin land regions, and to stop wind erosion there. Moreover, 
the use of these implements increased the grain crop yield by an 
average of two to five quintals per hectare. This is because 
preserving the plant remnants contributes to snow retention, and 
consequently to increasing the moisture in the soil. The 
developers of the equipment were awarded the Lenin Prize in 1972. 
  At the same time, the operation of the first subsurface 
cultivators and other machines convinced us of the need for 
their further improvement. As more and more new areas were 
plowed, more productive and reliable equipment was required. In 
addition to VIM, associates of the Special Design Bureau for 
Anti-Erosion Equipment (GSKB PET), created in Tselinograd in 
1965, with the participation of specialists from VISKhOM 
[All-Union Agricultural Machine Building Scientific Research 
Institute], VNIIZKh [All-Union Grain Farming Scientific Research 
Institute] and KazNIIMESKh [Agricultural Mechanization and 
Electrification Scientific Research Institute of the Northwest 
USSR], were attached to the work. Through their joint efforts, a 
set of second-generation machines, which included 20 
descriptions, was successfully designed. 
  The farms of the virgin land regions began to receive the 
KPSh-9 and KPSh-11 wide swath subsurface cultivators. Their 
swath width is respectively 9 and 11 meters, which is several 
times more than that of their predecessors. The output of 
harrows, grain erosion drills, snowplow-swath collectors and 
other machines distinguished by both high reliability and by a 
wider swath, was also developed. For instance, the BMSh-15 and 
BMSh-20 type harrow-hoes are capable of tilling a strip of land 
15 and 20 meters wide. 
  The fact that, by that time high-power tractors such as the 
T-150, K-700 and K-701 had been developed and produced, 
contributed to widescale use of this powerful equipment. There 
was no longer any need to use clumsy tractor hitches. Labor 
productivity more than doubled. 
  The main result was that wind erosion was conquered. The 
volume of soil-protective technology introduced rose 
considerably. This made it possible to obtain an additional 
13-15 million tonnes of grain a year. The group of scientists 
and specialists -- the creators of the second-generation 
machines and implements -- were awarded the State Prize in 1988. 
Among them were L. Kim, A. Buryakov, A. Gribanovskiy, G. Kuzmin, 
V. Suchkov and others. 
  Work is now continuing on improving the subsurface 
equipment. 
The task lies in creating ecologically safe, as specialists say, 
agrophilic machines and implements. The adverse effect of their 
working members on the soil should be minimal: they will 
pulverize it less, better retain the plant remnants and pack it 
down less.

  [Text] What does the coming year have in store for us? 
Hopes, doubts, alarms -- these are feelings very familiar to 
every grain grower as spring approaches. Most of the regions 
sown to winter crops, even the non-fallow predecessors from 
fall, have good moisture reserves in the soil, and after all, it 
is they which in many ways determine the growth and development 
of the crops in the first two months after the regeneration of 
the spring vegetation.

  At the same time, the soil's content of nutrients is 
extremely meager. Last year's negative balance of them, when the 
removal with the crops and weeds exceeded the intake with 
mineral and organic fertilizers by a factor of three, had its 
effect. According to the data of soil diagnosticians, the 
already small reserves of nitrogen were washed from the top soil 
to deeper layers. In virtually all the areas, the winter grain 
had to be given supplementary feeding with nitrogen fertilizers, 
and in intensive farming -- double supplementary feeding with 
complex fertilizers cut into the soil with grain seeders. 
  Predictions are that root rot will be widespread in spring, 
and to combat it, in addition to fungicides, we widely recommend 
the use of liquid complex fertilizers, phosphorus and potassium 
solutions. This not only reduces the damage to the plants due to 
fungus disease, but also increases the stalk's resistance to 
lodging. 
  For more productive use of ground equipment and agricultural 
aviation, it is advisable to make wide use of tank mixtures of 
fertilizers, pesticides and retardants. 
  The moisture reserves in the soil make it possible to 
predict 
the high efficiency of local use of fertilizers when spring 
wheat and corn crops are planted: each kilogram of nutrients 
will make it possible to obtain an additional 5-7 kilograms, 
converted to grain, of products. Last year, despite the sharp 
rise in prices for mineral fertilizers, every ruble spent for 
their application became 1.5-2 rubles net profit. 
  Unfortunately, because of financial difficulties and a lack 
of money in the rural commodity producers' accounts, the 
warehouses of the farms and Selkhozkhimiya rayon associations 
stand empty. Many chemical combines suspended production in 
December-January for the same reason. There is no clarity with 
respect to the supply of aviation gasoline -- and time is not 
standing still. 
  One recalls the sad experience of last year. When the 
agricultural producers rushed to look for fertilizers in 
April-May, the jobbing demand for them began. Things got to the 
point where the government was forced to forbid the export of 
fertilizers outside Russia for two months, but, despite the 
measures taken, the chemical industry could not, just like that, 
fully satisfy the peasants' demand. 
  One way of getting out of the situation that has been 
created 
can be seen -- to come to an agreement with the chemical 
enterprises on shipping mineral fertilizers and pesticides to 
the warehouses of the Selkhozkhimiya rayon associations, without 
pre-payment, for responsible storage. This will make possible 
fuller use of the production capacities of the Selkhozkhimiya 
supplying enterprises and storages, and the agricultural 
producers will gain the possibility of carrying out agrochemical 
and protective work in the necessary amounts and in better 
agrotechnical periods.

Institute of Chemical Production and Technology, and Anatoliy 
Kondratenko, chief specialist in Main Chemical Plant Protection 
Administration of Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production: 
"It Is Time To Gather...Fertilizer"] 
  [Text] Agrometeorological forecasts for the majority of 
Russia's regions are completely favorable, promising good 
conditions for ample precipitation in spring. Farmers feel that 
this gift of nature cannot be dismissed. It will be important to 
concentrate on local applications of complete fertilizers during 
the sowing of spring crops. Their effectiveness will be higher 
than ever, because of the extremely low content of nutrients in 
the soil. Last year's negative balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, 
and potassium--when the quantity of these removed from the soil 
with the harvest and weeds was three times as great as the 
quantity added to the soil in mineral and organic fertilizers. 
  In addition to this, even the meager remaining supply of 
nitrogen was washed into the deepest layers of the soil by the 
fall rains, and winter grain crops required top dressing almost 
everywhere. Besides this, widespread blight and root rot are 
expected, and these will have to be combated with protective 
chemicals and with complete liquid fertilizers and phosphorus 
and potassium solutions. In short, mixtures of fertilizers, 
pesticides, and retardants will have to be applied on a broad 
scale, mainly by agricultural aircraft. 
  In southern Russia this work should begin any day, but it 
probably will not begin because the mineral fertilizer storage 
bins of farms and associations of the Agricultural Chemicals 
Administration are empty, and no one knows where the gasoline 
for airplanes and helicopters will come from. The production of 
mineral fertilizers has been stopped or is on the verge of being 
stopped at the large chemical combines in Nevinnomyssk, 
Tolyatti, Uvarovo, Kemerovo, Dzerzhinsk, Solikamsk, Cherepovets, 
and Balakovo. There has been a corresponding dramatic decrease 
in the demand for raw materials for fertilizer produced by the 
Apatit, Uralkaliy, and Silvinit production associations. As a 
result, last December agricultural producers obtained an average 
of only 500 grams of nutritive substances per hectare of plowed 
land. 
  In more specific terms, farms in Volgograd, Saratov, Kurgan, 
Orenburg, Novosibirsk, and Omsk oblasts, Altay Kray, Kalmykia, 
and Dagestan have two or three kilograms of mineral fertilizers 
per hectare for this year's harvest. Farmers in the United 
States use 100 kilograms per hectare, farmers in Germany use 400 
kilograms, and in the Netherlands they use 800 kilograms per 
hectare! 
  Last year's sad experience testified that the preferential 
credits and 30-percent subsidy for mineral fertilizers and 
pesticides in March resulted only in a sudden high demand for 
them in April and May--i.e., at the height of the spring sowing 
season, when chemical combines were unable to fill all orders in 
such a short time. Furthermore, the state aid to agriculture 
went astray in commercial banks. 
  Is this likely to happen again? It might. Secretary O. Lobov 
of the Russian Federation Security Council informed the 
president of the disastrous state of the production and use of 
mineral fertilizers. On the last day of last year, B.N. Yeltsin 
issued the appropriate instructions to the government. Now 
almost a whole month has gone by. What has happened? No one is 
doing anything, and it appears that no one plans to do anything. 
After all, it will not be the first time the omnipotent Ministry 
of Finance and Ministry of Economics have put the brakes on such 
instructions. 
  Apparently, in the words of the biblical parable, it is time 
to start gathering stones instead of scattering them. We see 
only one solution: The state should pay chemical combines 
directly for fertilizers, meliorative chemicals, and pesticides 
delivered to the storage facilities of the Agricultural 
Chemicals Administration. This is the only way agricultural 
producers will be able to conduct agrochemical and protective 
operations on the necessary scales and at the best possible 
times. 
  This should not be viewed as aid to the rural community: 
Agriculture not only produces food, but also provides jobs for 
tens of millions of industrial workers in the chemical industry, 
machine building, power engineering, transportation, and other 
branches!

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Fedorov (St. Petersburg): "We Need a </F>
Precise Program"] 
  [Text] Representatives of the trade-union organizations of 
the largest machine-building enterprises called upon all labor 
collectives in the country to stop the total devastation of the 
national economic complex and to not be indifferent observers of 
the tribulations of national industry. They had gathered for a 
joint meeting in the Kirovskiy Zavod joint-stock company. 
  It has been more than 70 years since Russia experienced this 
kind of economic collapse, and whereas the collapse then was 
caused largely by the effects of civil war and intervention, now 
the powers that be are wholly to blame. As speakers said at the 
meeting, all structures of production management--local, 
regional, and national--are absolutely paralyzed. 
  Agricultural machine building, however, might be in the 
worst 
position. All work has stopped at the largest tractor 
plants--the Altay, Vladimir, Volgograd, Lipetsk, and Ural 
plants. Tractor production is at a standstill at the Kirov 
Plant, and this has halted operations at most other related 
enterprises. Hundreds of thousands of highly skilled workers 
have had to take an unpaid leave from work. 
  The survival of the enterprises, speakers said, will require 
a precise government program for emergence from the crisis, 
primarily entailing changes in tax policy, the alleviation of 
the effects of mutual non-payments, and the creation of 
advantageous conditions for Russian producers of goods. 
  "It has to begin with the payment of the state's debts to 
the 
rural community and with its economic revitalization," said 
Chairman Pozdnyakov of the trade-union committee of the 
Rostselmash joint-stock company. "Then industry will also 
recover." 
  Speakers suggested that all members of labor collectives be 
asked to gather at their previous places of employment as a 
means of exerting social pressure and reinforcing the 
consolidation of the laboring public. An organizing committee 
was formed to take charge of the preparations for an all-Russian 
conference of industrial workers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Samoylov, creator of the Ispolin </F>
Concern, by Viktor Andriyanov and Vladislav Boyarkin; place and 
date not given: "Everything Will Come Through for Ispolin"] 
  [Text] At exactly 1100, as agreed, a plain Zhiguli 
drove up to the entrance of the Lenin Order Recipient Space 
Research Institute (copied from the plaque). A young man of the 
Pierre Bezukhov type emerged from the car. In an unbuttoned, 
loose-hanging coat. 
  "They are with me," he told the guard, and the 
turnstile turned three times, letting us into one of the most 
secret institutes. 
  We walked past a winter garden, where mock-up space 
craft were scattered amidst the palm trees, past doors with 
combination locks and the nameplates of scientists known 
throughout the world. But the topic we were going to write about 
was not space research. Under this cosmic roof--uncrowded--lives 
Ispolin. 
  It is time to introduce its creator--Oleg Albertovich 
Samoylov. 
<H5>  Life Itself Turned Us Toward Production and High Technology </H5>
  [Samoylov] I was born in 1964 in Sverdlovsk--nowadays called 
Yekaterinburg. I was a young child when my parents took me to 
the then closed city of Krasnoyarsk-45, where enriched uranium 
was produced. My father worked there. Several years later we 
moved to Naberezhnyye Chelny. So I spent my youth at the KamAZ 
[Kama Auto Works]. 
  I did my army service in Mongolia and returned to the plant. 
I worked in the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth 
League] committee, trade union committee, and studied at the 
Imeni Plekhanova Institute of National Economy, specializing in 
finance and credit. 
  When perestroyka began, I worked for a while in a 
cooperative 
producing construction materials, and in 1989 I opened my own 
company--Intercom. A spare parts supplier. 
  At approximately the same time my current partners and 
colleagues Vladimir Rybakov and Aleksey Potapkin started their 
own business in Moscow. Their company, P&amp;R (Potapkin and 
Rybakov), sold spare parts for trucks. We combined our efforts 
and capital; the result was the Avtokomplekt company. I and four 
other guys who worked with me in Naberezhnyye Chelny became 
Muscovites. 
  [Question] Just like that? Only recently one could only get 
transferred to Moscow, as they used to say, in keeping with a 
decision of directive organs. This required lots of paperwork. 
  [Samoylov] "Different times--different songs..." In the fall 
of 1991 one could already buy both an apartment and a residence 
permit, which is what we did. We opened a number of other 
enterprises in addition to Avtokomplekt, and gradually arrived 
at the idea of a holding company. In the summer of last year 
Ispolin was registered as a Russian industrial-financial concern. 
  [Question] It appears that the word "Russian" in the company 
name is not accidental. 
  [Samoylov] Of course. We are patriotically-minded people. 
There is a German Bank, French Bank. Why should there not be a 
Russian Concern? 
  Today Ispolin has 22 companies under its umbrella and 37 
representations in Russia, the CIS, and foreign countries. 
  [Question] Oleg Albertovich, do you count yourself among 
what 
is called the new Russians? 
  [Samoylov] First of all, simply Russians. As to new, 
actually 
we are the second wave. 
  The first wave are those who started with some foundation. 
Someone transferred a state enterprise in his name in time, or 
buildings, or received free credit. We, on the other hand, 
started from scratch, with bare enthusiasm and enterprise. It 
took time to get on our feet. We worked in very difficult 
conditions, risking everything. And only now are we beginning to 
get ahead. 
  I am convinced that the future belongs to the second wave. 
They are people who came in too late to grab profitable and 
sweet positions in trade and the financial sphere. But on the 
other hand, this is good. Life itself turned us toward 
production and high technology. Some people are just beginning 
to contemplate it, while we are already working with it. 
  [Question] Where did you start in production? 
  [Samoylov] We worked with the Yakutalmaz Association, 
supplying them--and continue to supply them--with spare parts, 
and working with them in a broad range of areas. In turn, we 
were asked to evaluate a number of designs. Among them was a 
very promising one--a special additive that replaces lubricant 
oil. 
  [Question] RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA reported on this invention. 
  [Samoylov] Yes, I read it. They are continuing the 
experiments in Yakutia. The results are generally good, but 
there are still a number of unresolved problems. 
  Gradually we established contacts with a number of 
institutes; they got to know us; serious proposals started 
coming in. You are well aware that in many technologies we are 
ahead of the West. But the authors of this development 
work--scientific research institutes and design bureaus--subsist 
in poverty; they do not have enough money to pay for heating and 
communications, let alone salaries. 
  Ispolin AO [joint-stock company] experts carefully evaluate 
proposed designs. Some of them have already gone through 
production testing and been put into commercial production. I 
will mention, for instance, laser grinding of ball-bearings, air 
conditioners that operate without freon--practically all African 
countries have placed orders for them. In Tarusa we backed the 
production of synthetic emeralds and rubies that are used 
primarily in microelectronics. 
  [Question] What if after this interview is published you get 
flooded with proposals from RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers? 
  [Samoylov] They will be most welcome. 
  [Question] What type of development work are you interested 
in? 
  [Samoylov] A rather broad spectrum. But it has to be 
innovative, breakthrough technology. The air conditioners I 
mentioned are far superior to any foreign analogues. They are 
built by a domestically developed technology that was used in 
the defense industry. These air conditioners also will be 
installed on KamAZ trucks intended for tropical countries. We 
put a system of filters in it, and you can fill them with any 
water, even from a puddle. 
  [Question] The second part of this question. As a rule, 
after 
such materials are published, the editors are contacted by 
directors of enterprises that have unused capacities, most often 
undergoing conversion. Are you interested in such contacts? 
  [Samoylov] Without question! Why build a new plant if the 
capacity already exists, as well as skilled cadres. Just take it 
and set up production. 
  Here is another design that was brought to me: an automatic 
nail-making machine. You put wire into it, punch in the program, 
and that is all! There are good heads in the country, but it 
hurts when foreigners buy up our talents for peanuts. They give 
you two or three trips a year and some pocket money. For our 
people this is crazy money, but the result is that developments 
and technologies stay abroad for nothing. 
<H3>  I Took Gaydar's Resignation in Stride. I Liked Ryzhkov's 
Program More, For All the Criticism Heaped on It </H3>
  [Question] You invest money in production, applications of 
high technology. But many of your colleagues still see only 
trading and middleman activities as the source of quick and 
reliable income. 
  [Samoylov] To the best of my knowledge they are afraid to 
invest money in long-term projects because of political 
instability. 
  Nevertheless, I think that production should now be the 
foundation of Russian business. Politicians come and go, but 
industry remains. I hope that those in the Kremlin and the 
government will understand this and stop strangling producers 
with taxes. 
  I have to confess that I took Gaydar's resignation in 
stride. 
I see his strong points. But as a person involved in concrete 
entrepreneurial activities, I believe that for a head of 
government it is not enough to know theory, thorough as that 
knowledge may be. 
  [Question] This is the opinion of an entrepreneur. What is 
dear to you as a citizen and a person? 
  [Samoylov] I have already partially answered this question. 
I 
am against the kind of society that is ascending on our country, 
that we are trying to copy from the United States. It is a 
society oriented toward money, profit; an extremely cruel world. 
I am for the spirituality that has always existed in Russia. 
  I am a patriotically-minded person, although there are 
attempts now to slander and distort this notion. Let the jeers 
against patriotism remain on the conscience of people without 
kith or kin. Look at how America worships its flag, how an 
Englishman, German, or Frenchman loves his country. Why are 
Russians being deprived of this right? There is no shame in 
being a son of the fatherland, which is the literal translation 
of the word "patriot" from French. On the contrary, one should 
be proud of it. 
  No, I do not accept everything new. I disagree with many 
things that are being done now. My credo is that we have to work 
hard. Very hard. So that Russia may prosper and ourselves along 
with it. Because prosperity of the state is tied directly with 
our prosperity. 
  I am not a cosmopolitan. I do not reject everything of the 
past just because it is declared old. Conscience does not grow 
old. Neither does truth, loyalty, and duty. I cannot agree with 
those who dismiss the entire history of my country, even the 
post-October one. Does it mean we have to start on a blank page 
again? Does it mean I have to also dismiss the life of my 
father, Albert Vasilyevich? But I saw for myself how hard he 
worked, earned three higher degrees. Everything that is best in 
me is from him. 
  Now the country has jumped into another extreme. I, on the 
other hand, am for forward motion. And in general I am an 
adherent of the plan Nikolay Ivanovich Ryzhkov was fighting to 
implement. I am a supporter of his programs, his actions, 
although they have been discredited to a large extent. Ryzhkov's 
program is much closer to my liking than Gaydar's program. 
Because the entire world has arrived at a regulated market 
instead of the bazaar we are being saddled with. 
  A country must choose its priorities during difficult times. 
On the other hand, one day we want to replace the roof over 
Luzhniki, the next day we begin to build an underground city 
under Manezh Square. As if there are no other concerns left, as 
if everything has been put right in Moscow, everybody lives 
well--there is enough housing for everyone, for instance. 
  What is the foundation of a society? The economy. Science. 
Culture, education, art. In the economy we are getting an 
alternating cold-and-hot water shower. Science and culture have 
been neglected altogether. One gets the impression that the next 
step is to leave the country without culture. A young actor gets 
paid 20,000 rubles [R]; how he survives is a mystery! The 
greatest actors are paid R80,000. This is simply cruel. 
<H5>  Russian Benefactors Are a Thread From the Past to the Future </H5>
  [Question] But what can you do? 
  [Samoylov] Entrepreneurs can do a lot. Have you heard about 
icon painting on birch bark? I would not be surprised if you 
have not--this ancient type of art has all but disappeared 
thanks to the many years of "loving care" extended to the church 
and master icon painters. Until recently only three icons on 
birch bark have been known to exist, all of them in private 
collections. Now there are about 15 such icons in Russia: the 
secrets of the old masters have been found and are being 
revitalized, and the Ispolin Concern is financing this work. 
  Or take Khokhloma wood-painting. It is familiar to 
practically every citizen of Russia, but how many people know 
that entry into the free market did not work well for Khokhloma 
craftsmen? Learning of the problems this craft was experiencing, 
we decided to help the artists and organized our own studio. The 
result: a collection created in this studio has been invited to 
a Sotheby auction in England. 
  [Question] Well, since it has got to the point of Sotheby, 
this means that you will come out a winner, too. 
  [Samoylov] Excuse me, but I have not finished. Fortunately, 
not everything in this world is measured by the "profit or loss" 
formula. I, for instance, care a lot about the theater. This 
truly is an inalienable part of my life. I could not possibly 
live in any other country--if for no other reason than because, 
in my opinion, Russia is the only country where the theater as 
the highest achievement of human civilization is not yet dead. 
Of course, in this there is no notion of "profit or loss"--if I 
can help, I do. We finance the "Modern" theater, and have 
established awards for young actors. 
  In the past I dreamt of becoming a theatrical director. 
Friends sometimes joke: All right, since you did not get to be a 
theatrical director, you became a concern president--same thing, 
your directorial talent still comes through. Speaking seriously, 
I am indeed tied to the theater in an official way now: I have 
been elected vice president of the Moscow Charitable Actors 
Fund, where I came with my program "Young Benefactors for Young 
Actors." 
  [Question] There is a book "Russian Benefactors" on your 
desk. Is this the example you are trying to emulate? 
  [Samoylov] If you wish. There is a man I would like to 
emulate spiritually--Savva Morozov. Unfortunately, little is 
known about him in Russia, mainly at the level of school 
textbooks. He was a great man. Many people know that he built 
the Moscow Art Theater, that he helped actors. But practically 
nobody knows that he helped science, established scholarships in 
St. Petersburg University. That he applied the latest inventions 
in the theater and was himself an inventor. 
<H5>  Only Very Rich People Can Afford Two Days Off a Week </H5>
  [Samoylov] I understand that to come close to the image of 
this man, one has to work very hard. 
  [Question] Very hard--how hard is that? Today is Saturday, 
but your colleagues are at work. 
  [Samoylov] Good observation--for us Saturday is a regular 
work day. Once a director of a South Korean firm--our 
partner--remarked with certain sarcasm that Russians must be 
very rich people if they can afford two days off a week. We had 
to explain to him that workers in our concern, for instance, 
make do with only one day off. Generally speaking, we work as 
much as is needed. 
  The state has shrugged off science and culture. All right, 
but at least allow entrepreneurs to take over. Provide 
incentives, as in the United States. They have zillions of 
different foundations. If you use some of your money for 
charitable activities, the same amount is exempt from taxation. 
If a farmer invests more than 40 percent of his income in new 
technologies, he is exempt from taxes altogether. This is a 
policy. 
  We, on the other hand... I understand, they are fighting for 
those cozy jobs and have no time to think of other things. So 
they measure everyone with the same yardstick and issue a 
regulation. It does not matter what you do--trade or production. 
  Because there are too many nonprofessionals in the upper 
echelons. Maybe they knew how to do something before, in the 
rallies, but in the new situation they cannot find their 
bearings. The situation will change when new people rise to the 
top--those who are 30 to 40 today. 
  [Question] The second wave? 
  [Samoylov] Yes. The richest people are those who are in 
trade, but they were not the ones who built America. America was 
built by Ford, Chrysler, General Motors... We are not yet as 
strong as the first wave, those who have made millions, billions 
of dollars. But to the extent of our ability we are helping to 
rebuild Russia. 
  [Question] What do you value in life? 
  [Samoylov] Books. I like reading the classics most. My 
favorite writers are Dreiser and Dostoyevskiy. Whenever I have 
free time, I read. I do not spend time at health resorts, do not 
travel to the Canary Islands for recreation, and do not take 
vacations in general. I do not have a dacha or a foreign-made 
car. Of course, we are not poor, but neither are we super-rich. 
  [Question] What things do you not accept? 
  [Samoylov] Meanness and betrayal. 
  [Question] Have you had encounters with them? 
  [Samoylov] Both in life and in business. Generally, I am a 
gentle, kind man, even sentimental. I have been cheated many 
times, and many times had to start from scratch. 
  [Question] What are you counting on? 
  [Samoylov] The common sense of the people. 
  [Question] We wish you success.

<F P=106> [Article by IZVESTIYA writer Marina Denisova: "Newspapers </F>
Appear on Television"] 
  [Text] The desire of Yegor Yakovlev's OBSHCHAYA GAZETA to 
have their own television air time has been fulfilled. On 
Wednesday, 26 January, viewers of Rossiya Channel were able to 
see a program presented by the new television company 
Oblik--"Off Guard, or Newspaper Stories." The cofounders of 
Oblik along with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA were the independent 
television company REN-TV and Tatyana Menshikova (past director 
of the Politika Studio in Ostankino). 
  The information base for the new television program is made 
up of published and unpublished materials (from investigations 
to "Love Story") of journalists from various newspapers: NOVAYA 
YEZHEDNEVNAYA, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, IZVESTIYA, LITERATURNAYA 
GAZETA, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, and others. This certainly does not 
mean that the journalists will be running with microphones and 
cameras in hand after heroes for their articles. "This 
absolutely does not mean that `Newspaper Stories' will be a 
symbiosis of commentary and pathos," says Tatyana Menshikova. 
"And this program does not intend to exist as a television 
version of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, although we do not deny that we 
subscribe to its ideology. In general the system of constraints 
has been thoroughly developed: No coverage of catastrophes on 
the screen, no direct assessments of events and phenomena, no 
interviews with politicians, not a lot of talking during the 
sequence--everyone is tired of this already." 
  In terms of form "Newspaper Stories" will be four 10-minute 
films. They will be films because the program is made by movie 
makers--die-hards of domestic television documentation like 
director Aleksandr Orkin and the young people from the VGIK 
[All-Union State Institute of Cinematography]. 
  "Newspaper Stories" is fundamentally positive in terms of 
direction and intends to actively advocate nonviolence in the 
best traditions of pacifism. 
  The example of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA is being followed by other 
publications: CHASTNAYA ZHIZN, which is known for its 
predilection for the spicy and the racy, along with the 
independent studio Antrepriza HCD on a parity basis will begin 
to film the half-hour, absolutely apolitical program "Television 
`Private Life'" which will air in Moscow once every two weeks 
starting on 13 February. The program will be a television 
version of the newspaper, and many rubrics of "Private Life" 
("He and She," "Candid Interview," "C'est la Vie") will begin 
their television life soon.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Petrovskaya: "Premiere. NTV Begins </F>
and...Something About the Attitude Toward Traditions"] 
  [Text] The independent company NTV went on the air on 
Channel 4 on 17 January. And a week later, on 25 January, Andrey 
Karaulov, was speaking on "Moments of Truth" with Mikhail 
Poltoranin. 
  Mikhail Nikiforovich was in a very good mood and this mood 
changed only a couple of times--when the conversation turned to 
NTV. Karaulov was even surprised--why has your expression 
changed? What, actually, is so bad about Mr. Gusinskiy, with 
whose money Malashenko, Dobrodeyev, and Kiselev created NTV? 
  "I have no complaints against either Malashenko or 
Gusinskiy," answered Poltoranin. "If I had extra money I, too, 
would indulge in acquiring mass media." But the main danger, in 
Poltoranin's opinion, in the appearance of nonstate mass media 
is that "in this bacchanalia" a new language of the press is 
being introduced into practice--"camp Hebrew: a combustible 
mixture of Russophobia, hatred for traditions, lies, and 
contempt for human dignity...." 
  We shall leave on the conscience of the interviewee the vile 
nationalistic odor that emanates from his statements. 
Russophobia, from all appearances, means hatred for Mr. 
Poltoranin personally, which is not concealed by NTV (and not 
only NTV) journalists. And hatred for traditions--this is 
obviously the aspiration of Messrs. Gusinskiy, Malashenko, and 
people like them to crush the traditional, many-year state 
monopoly on the mass media and above all on the most powerful 
ones--electronic, that is, television. 
  Now that this tradition is finally if not destroyed at least 
violated, one can understand the monstrous resistance that had 
to be overcome against the people who were encroaching on the 
"holy," who intended to create a television company that is 
independent of the state. 
  Sagalayev's Channel 6 does not count. He did not present any 
special threat to the powers that be because for a long time he 
was, and essentially still is today, a kind of broadcast booth 
delivering films and foreign news to our screens. 
  NTV is another matter. Its initiators openly declared the 
need for the presence on the television screen of information 
that is politically neutral and free of state supervision. And, 
naturally, they promised to create this since the state was 
generous enough to give them one of its channels. 
  The wave of articles written against the "power of the 
moneybags who want to take state TV into their dirty hands" 
flooded the newspapers last autumn. Television is costly, the 
defenders of NTV said in response. If the state does not have 
the possibility of supporting its own TV, why not turn part of 
it over (sell) to those who do have these possibilities? The 
"opponents" of nonstate TV accused its "defenders" of selling 
out to "Most." That is why they are supporting those who want to 
subvert statehood. 
  NTV's debut on the St. Petersburg channel confirmed the 
worst 
fears of the "enemies": Journalists of the NTV information 
programs did not agitate, did not propagandize, but efficiently 
informed the viewers about what had happened in the country and 
the world. 
  It was the simplest thing in the world to silence the 
uncontrolled television company--refuse to give it air time. An 
attempt was made to do this: Even before the final version of 
the president's edict on transferring Channel 4 to NTV took 
effect, NTV leaders received a fax from St. Petersburg. A 
certain Petrenko (Kurkova's deputy) informed his colleagues: The 
Ministry of Information and the Press is cutting budget 
allocations for the St. Petersburg channel because a commercial 
television company is broadcasting on its frequencies and 
therefore the channel's leaders are dissolving the agreement 
with NTV effective 1 April 1994. 
  Thank God the situation changed. Every cloud has a silver 
lining. State TV made a complete mess of the elections. The 
fools stayed with the fools. Apparently there was somebody 
intelligent who was able to convince the president to sign the 
edict that had been canceled. 
  The most influential opponent of destatized TV, Mr. 
Poltoranin, was disgraced and dismissed, but not defeated. The 
fight with the "independents" could be continued at any moment. 
The president's edict, incidentally, left a convenient loophole 
that makes it possible to restore the status quo if he 
wishes--Channel 4 is granted to NTV "as an experiment." Who will 
decide whether the experiment was successful or not? 
  We would like very much to believe that the viewers, who are 
questioned by sociologists, will decide. 
  Sociological data obtained by V. Vilchek's Service during 
the 
course of the first week of NTV broadcasting on Channel 4 show: 
The debut took place--and it was successful. All the films and 
programs presented to the court of the viewers without exception 
immediately gained a steady audience. So far there has been no 
stunning triumph. The viewers have not rushed en masse to 
Channel 4 and the other channels still have their usual 
audience. But there are not the kinds of fluctuations that are 
typical of other channels: For instance, "Field of Miracles" was 
viewed on Ostankino by 51 percent of the viewers, and the 
nightly "Press-Express" on that same day received only 2 
percent. Practically all the NTV night programs under the rubric 
"Retro TV" ("Tavern, 13 Chairs," "Around Laughter," "What? 
Where? When?") were seen by up to 12 percent of the viewers 
during the first week. This means that the viewers' demand was 
calculated quite precisely. The ratings of the NTV information 
programs increased from 5 to 16 percent during the week. At the 
same time the program "Today" is retaining its audience on the 
St. Petersburg channel, which shows the force of habit. The 
audience for Leonid Parfenov's program of nonpolitical news, 
"The Other Day," increased sharply: While on the St. Petersburg 
channel during all the time of its existence it never exceeded 5 
percent, last Saturday it exactly doubled. And another 5 percent 
watched "The Other Day" on Channel 5. The program "Results" on 
Sundays garnered a total of 25 percent of the audience (17 
percent on Channel 4 and 8 percent on Channel 5), which 
approaches their former Ostankino indicator. The rating of the 
program "Vremechko" (which NTV is now buying from Avtorskoye TV) 
increased 1.5-fold and on certain days it even doubled. This can 
be explained by the fact that the usual audience for this 
extremely specific program was augmented by the audience for the 
artistic films shown by NTV before "Vremechko." The viewers gave 
a good reception to practically all the documentaries, cartoons, 
and game films without exception--their audience ranged from 10 
to 19 percent. 
  On the whole, from the results of the week one can say that 
no other company that started from scratch has had such a sure 
start. According to the data from a telephone poll of readers 
last Monday, at the end of the week 40 percent of those 
questioned were watching NTV programs at one time or another. 
Sociologists have never seen this kind of "full use" of Channel 
4 before. 
  According to eyewitness testimony a slight panic reigned at 
the Ostankino briefing two days after NTV's debut. The terrible 
word was pronounced--"competitor." A strategic task was set--"we 
must do something." 
  Well anyway--everything is normal. We have lived to see 
competition on the airwaves. Now, whether we like it or not, it 
will be necessary to fight for the viewers. This is something 
new not only for TV itself, but also for the viewer--he is not 
used to having anybody fight over him. My girlfriend's father 
joked to me about NTV: "They have taken my life away." In the 
sense that now all you have to do is sit and watch. It is 
possible, of course, not to watch but it is a shame to pass up 
something interesting. This feeling--"it is a shame to pass it 
up"--has not been with our viewers for very long. Something else 
is more typical and traditional--"again nothing to watch." Here 
Poltoranin is undoubtedly right: Nonstate TV demonstrates an 
overt hatred for tradition not by ignoring the viewer but by 
showing an unusual concern for him. 
  In general the devil of nonstate TV did not turn out to be 
as 
terrible as certain "traditionalists" tried to depict him. On 
the contrary, he is fairly attractive. Television oriented 
toward the viewer--such is the traditional "mark" of normal TV 
throughout the world. If anybody tries to prove to me that this 
is bad I will listen with interest but I will hardly agree. TV 
oriented only toward the authorities is much worse. TV oriented 
only toward commerce is much much worse.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valentin Logunov, former editor in chief of </F>
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, by Pavel Koltsov; place and date not given: 
"Valentin Logunov: `We Did Not Betray the Ideas of the 
Interregional Deputy Group'"] 
  [Text] The former editor in chief of ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA thinks that this publication should be taken back under 
the wing of the legislators. 
  As a rule, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA does not intervene in 
the disputes and conflicts involving colleagues within the 
editorial offices. But there are exceptions. We decided to 
publish the interview with Valentin Logunov, former editor in 
chief of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA (he calls himself the "organizer of 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA" and "one of Boris Yeltsin's associates") for 
several reasons. First, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA is a budget-financed 
organization and this means that it is paid for by the 
taxpayers, and if only for that reason its destiny is more than 
the private affair of the editorial staff alone. In the second 
place, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA was drawn in to the extremely fierce 
conflict between the two branches of Russian power and did not 
emerge from it without losses. In the third place, in the 
corridors of the State Duma there are discussions of the need to 
return the parliamentary ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to the legislators. 
  Valentin Logunov is a former USSR people's deputy and a 
member of the coordinating council of the Interregional Deputy 
Group [IDG] of the Union Congress. At the end of September 1993 
he was discharged by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
from the position of editor in chief of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  [Koltsov] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA was shut down twice in three 
years. The first time by a decree of the State Committee for the 
State of Emergency and the second time--on the basis of 
Yeltsin's edict. Why? 
  [Logunov] You see, from the autumn of 1991 through September 
1993 ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA made a marked shift in the sense of 
supporting political leaders. And from the standpoint of past 
authorities--the State Committee for the State of Emergency--and 
present ones--President Yeltsin--it turned out to be a 
politically dangerous publication for both. 
  [Koltsov] You said that the newspaper had made a marked 
shift. Does this mean that the editor in chief also recanted his 
initial political views? 
  [Logunov] It is sufficient to leaf through the files of 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to be convinced that this is not true. The 
newspaper and I, its editor in chief, never betrayed those 
ideals of the IDG. Remember which ideas came from the IDG: power 
to the soviets, separation of powers, parliamentarianism, a 
multiparty system, freedom of the press and speech...and who 
cast off these white robes when they came to power? Was it not 
Popov and Yeltsin, the former cochairmen of the IDG? Was it not 
Burbulis and Poltoranin, former members of the coordinating 
council of the IDG? Time and the actions of these people showed 
that the main thing for them was power for its own sake. 
  Even now I think that the Supreme Soviet, with all of its 
shortcomings, was a most influential and responsible political 
force, one capable of opposing the antinational policy of the 
Yeltsin team. And this political, I repeat, political force was 
suppressed by arms, by the army. The Constitution was trampled 
upon, dozens of federal laws were grossly violated, and citizens 
were killed. After what happened I cursed the days when I 
supported and aided Yeltsin. So others have committed the 
betrayal. 
  [Koltsov] You fiercely condemn the Yeltsin team but what is 
your attitude toward politics and politicians close to 
Khasbulatov? 
  [Logunov] You apparently want to know mainly my attitude 
toward Khasbulatov. In my view he is one of the politicians of 
the new wave, after 1990. Apparently his fairly good education, 
his analytical mind, and his exceptional ability to work have 
had their effect. I am convinced that he could have done a great 
deal of good for Russia if the Supreme Soviet had not been 
forced into a confrontation. I have already had occasion to 
speak about this but I repeat: The irreconcilability and 
hostility between the president and the Supreme Soviet was 
fanned artificially and those I have already mentioned in our 
conversation were especially successful at this. They were 
constantly getting the president riled up and agitated. They 
deliberately drove the parliament into a right-wing, 
"conservative" corner. 
  Remember how they badgered Khasbulatov. Yeltsin's team, the 
press, and television used the same devices and methods that 
were used against Yeltsin himself at one time. All this was 
loathsome and I am surprised that he could endure such a thing. 
I chanced to find him in a depressed condition after a regular 
attack. What can you say to a person when buckets of mud have 
been slung at him? I said: "Ruslan Imranovich, hang on another 
year. In a year Russia will understand who is who." He laughed: 
"A year?! What are you talking about!" Approximately a year 
later they were shooting at parliament. 
  Of course Khasbulatov had many shortcomings. It seems to me 
that he had a poor sense of people's psychology. He did not 
listen enough to others' opinions. He was trusting and 
untrusting at the same time, depending on his subjective idea of 
a person. Sometimes he admired himself and was restrained in his 
assessments of his opponents, which caused him a great deal of 
harm. But I am convinced that Russia will need Khasbulatov as a 
politician. True, I am not sure that he will want to work at 
this after all they have done to him. 
  [Koltsov] Do you think that the suspension of the 
publication 
of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA during September and October and your 
dismissal from your positions--was all this not done to get back 
at you personally? 
  [Logunov] Well that was probably not the only thing and not 
the biggest thing that provoked them to take such measures. You 
see, by that time ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA really had become an 
influential publication both in Russia and abroad. The newspaper 
adequately reflected the Supreme Soviet's position and we 
discussed the political situation in the regions in detail and 
objectively. And, well, could the authorities who decided to 
physically destroy the Russian parliament fail to turn their 
gaze to the newspaper of the Supreme Soviet? Look: On 21 
September 1993 the famous Edict No. 1400 came out and on 23 
September Chernomyrdin signed the decree on ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, 
and on 24 September I was dismissed from my position. What speed! 
  [Koltsov] They say that they had to force you to leave your 
office. 
  [Logunov] The "assumption of power" of the new editor, 
Natalya Polezhayeva, took place in the presence of three or four 
armed men. Later I was told that these people were from Mikhail 
Poltoranin's guard. I do not know, perhaps things would have 
reached the point of the use of force but I left the office of 
my own accord. That happened on 5 October, after the White House 
was fired upon. 
  [Koltsov] You probably do not regard with favor the current 
editor in chief of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  [Logunov] This person was promoted by Poltoranin. She told 
me 
in our first conversation that she could not refuse Mikhail 
Poltoranin because she owed him a great deal. It is known that 
Poltoranin went through dozens of applications but they all 
refused, apparently thinking it unethical to break into a house 
that was built by others. It seemed to me that Natalya 
Polezhayeva also was experiencing shame; her entire face was 
covered with red spots. I even sympathized with her at that time 
and said that it was not very gentlemanly of Poltoranin to heap 
such moral responsibility upon a woman's shoulders. But later 
she obviously overcame her sense of embarrassment and 
awkwardness. 
  [Koltsov] How do you feel about the talk of turning 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA over to the State Duma? 
  [Logunov] I am convinced that ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA readers do 
not want this. The circulation of newspapers depends to a 
certain degree on their political biases. The reader of one 
newspaper or another is the person who sees in the newspaper he 
selects a corroboration of his own views. We tried to be an 
objective newspaper, to present various viewpoints, but at the 
same time we resolutely defended parliamentarianism, the unity 
of Russia, the priorities of domestic entrepreneurship, and the 
spirituality of the nation. It is precisely with these 
qualities, in my view, that we attract readers. And suddenly, 
all at once, the reader starts getting a different newspaper. 
This is like it would be if you paid for one thing in a store 
and they slipped you something else. Of course the government 
cannot but understand how unceremoniously it has dealt with the 
readers but apparently it wants very badly to get its hands on 
this tidbit. 
  The second point is related to the interests and rights of 
the journalists of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. About 40 journalists have 
left it in three months--for political reasons. They could not 
and did not want to change their political convictions. So I 
wish to ask the "fathers of Russian democracy": Is this your 
democracy when a journalist does not have a chance to perform 
his professional duty, to write in his newspaper what he thinks 
is true, of that which he is sincerely convinced? 
  And, finally, the third point: To whom should the newspaper 
belong? I am convinced that it should be either the State Duma 
or the federal assembly as a whole. The president and government 
have adequate mass media where they can present their viewpoint. 
The legislator should have the same opportunity. Possibly the 
times will come when the mass media really do become 
independent, but to talk of this today is a deliberate 
deception. We found out about the "independence" of Bragin 
television and the pro-presidential newspapers, and we know 
quite well who supports them and how. 
  Also the utmost in hypocrisy are discussions to the effect 
that the authorities should not have their own newspapers. When 
waging these discussions that same Poltoranin had in mind only 
one authority, the one that did not suit him: the legislative. 
Now he and people who think as he does have ended up in the Duma 
and you can be sure that they will gain control of the mass 
media with the same persistence. The formula is simple: Where 
Poltoranin is, there too is the power. And it is both funny and 
sad at the same time. 
  I think that returning ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to the legislature 
is one of the first tasks that should be resolved by the State 
Duma. Then the Duma would be able to communicate with the voters 
in plain language. But we must not allow this cause to be joined 
by people who have compromised themselves with destructive 
qualities, who have manipulated the mass media all these years.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Minkin: "Mail: Criminal Candor"] </F>
  [Text] On Wednesday evening a package containing the 
note published below and a personal letter from its author, the 
editor in chief of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, was delivered to the 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA editorial offices. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
traditionally offers its readers the opportunity to express 
themselves freely on its pages, especially if there is a 
suspicion that the other pluralistic domestic press is not 
pluralistic enough, so that the invective the author holds dear 
will still be published somewhere. For example, during the first 
days after the August putsch in 1991 when the communist press 
was banned, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA published Mr. Limonov. But there 
is no need to attach personal letters. Everything is clear 
without them. 
  Monday on television M. Poltoranin stated: "Journalists use 
the language (not Russian) which I call `camp Hebrew.' It is the 
language of lies, Russophobia, and contempt for the people. The 
journalists do not understand that they are evoking a wave of 
anti-Semitism in response." 
  So this is the language in which the newspapers are 
published 
in Russia. 
  What comment can be made here, how can this be interpreted? 
  Poltoranin could have called the camp language "jargon," 
"criminal talk," or "perverted Russian." He called the language 
of journalists "camp Hebrew." 
  Hebrew is the ancient Jewish language. "Russophobia" is a 
word put into the chauvinistic article by the same name by the 
magazine NASH SOVREMENNIK. And in order to make sure there were 
no doubts, Poltoranin added the bit about the "wave of 
anti-Semitism in response." It was clear that only Semites could 
cause such a wave. 
  We did not learn anything new about Poltoranin. But this was 
the first time he was so candid. Like DEN, Pamyat, and Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  For the candor--thank you. 
  If M. Poltoranin, the chairman of the State Duma Committee 
on 
Mass Media, will allow us, we will teach him some pure Russian. 
For it was not in vain that he wrote in ROSSISKAYA GAZETA: "The 
average statistical journalist is an ordinary person who does 
not always understand the deep processes in the change of 
formations. He, too, needs guides to the roads of reform." 
  Now I know precisely who our Guide is. And, of course, I 
want 
always to understand the deep processes. 
  In the summer of 1950 Comrade Stalin wrote the work of 
genius 
"Marxism and Questions of Linguistics." 
  The entire country learned by heart the Discovery that 
language is neither a base nor a superstructure. So many people 
who understood poorly went to the camps--may God remember their 
names! 
  Poltoranin is a continuer of the great cause. He learned, he 
understood, and he did not forget. By adding to the word Hebrew 
the adjective "camp," Poltoranin, it seems, was also hinting at 
our future destination. 
  Deep processes are frequently reflected in folklore. And we, 
over a bottle, for many decades have sung accompanied by a 
guitar: 
  Comrade Stalin, you are a great scholar. 
  In 
linguistics you are simply a luminary. 
  But I am a 
simple Soviet prisoner-- 
  Not a Communist and not even 
a Jew. 
  We sing it in chorus--Russians and Jews and Tatars (we have 
all kinds of journalists). We sing in Russian because they did 
not teach us Hebrew. 
  We sing and we look at how, shuffling along with a party 
gait, the solid member of the State Duma goes to the podium. 
Chairman of the mass media, Russia's Choice, M. Poltoranin. 
  It is difficult to reproach a person for both anti-Semitism 
and Russophobia at the same time. But I have to say that you 
rarely hear such malicious Russophobery as comes from that same 
Poltoranin. On that same television program he stated: "The 
Russian idea is coming to a head, like a boil." 
  Is it not painful for you to sit down, Mikhail Nikiforovich? 
  P.S. I have no questions for the new procurator general. He 
already knows (from experience from Stepankov) that it is better 
not to disturb Poltoranin. Kazannik understands that fanning 
ethnic dissension at such an altitude--is not even criminality, 
it is not Article 74 of the Criminal Code of the Russian 
Federation, but--it is politics! Our native domestic politics. 
Because for a Western politician such a statement would be 
tantamount to suicide. 
  The only person to whom (without any special hope, 
incidentally) one can ask a serious question is Gaydar. 
  Yegor Timurovich, you are the leader of Russia's Choice. 
Poltoranin is in your ranks. If he says such things and you 
remain silent--does this mean that you have ripened? You are 
already a real 100-percent Soviet politician. You could be 
stamped as such. If there were a free space on you for the stamp.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Is With You Again"] </F>
  [Text] Our newspaper did not come out from 25 to 29 
January. This was an enforced break. And although the 
journalists of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI are not at fault, we apologize 
to our readers for the information loss that it caused them. 
  But here is what happened. The editorial office introduced a 
favorable subscription for them, taking into account the high 
price of the subscription to a state newspaper and desiring to 
assist citizens who are oriented on receiving accurate and 
truthful information at first hand. The creditor did not 
transfer money to the newspaper in time to pay for printing 
services, dispatching the publication, and payment for paper. 
  It is difficult not to associate this kind of "selective 
approach" with the fact that the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI journalistic 
collective itself decided at the end of last year to become the 
founder of its own newspaper, breaking off relations with the 
government, which was not fulfilling its duties as the founder. 
  The policy of the government and the establishment of 
Russian 
statehood nevertheless remain one of the main themes of our 
newspaper, but we can now elucidate it more accurately and 
objectively, but, above all, from the aspect with which 
important policy is turned to the individual and his daily needs 
and interests. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI is with you once again, dear reader. You, 
too, stick with us!

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Bespalova and Dmitriy Donskoy under the </F>
rubric "Problem": "1904-1994: There Is No Drop in the Number of 
Indigent in Russia; How Many of Them Are There Today--Nobody 
Knows"] 
  [Text] No statistics are kept on homeless people in Moscow, 
and therefore nobody knows their exact number. According to the 
most approximate estimates of specialists, it is several tens of 
thousands. In proportion to the total number of population of 
Moscow, this figure is considerably higher than in most other 
major Russian cities. An important transportation junction and 
the center of a metropolitan area, the capital has always 
attracted those for whom the song line "my address is not a 
house and not a street" has become a harsh reality of life 
rather than a romantic phrase. 
  One could get an indirect idea of the number of Moscow 
homeless from information on how many of them are brought 
annually to the only holding facility in the city, on 
Novoslobodskaya Street. For almost five years now this number 
has not dropped below 1,300. This is determined, however, not at 
all by the number of Moscow homeless but first and foremost by 
the capacity of the holding facility itself, which is precisely 
this figure. An ordinary Moscow citizen, however, can draw only 
one conclusion from his own observations: the number of beggars 
and homeless on Moscow streets and underground crossings is 
growing steadily from year to year. It is especially noticeable 
in the winter. In the summer, free to move away from central 
heating pipes and unlocked basements, the inhabitants of the 
capital city's foul places fan out to Russian nooks and 
crannies, only to return a few months later, in somewhat better 
shape, to the capital for the winter. In that same Moscow 
holding facility out-of-towners--a questionable definition as 
applied to the homeless--account for 72 percent of its clients. 
  The state that once proclaimed the slogan "Everything in the 
name of the people, everything for the good of the people" has 
now found itself unable to pay even minimal attention to 
vagrants. In 1991 Russia repealed the article in the criminal 
code that stipulated a penalty for vagrancy and begging. A 
democratic measure at first glance--each person is free to live 
the lifestyle he desires--in reality it only worsened the 
situation. Having stopped persecuting those who by all laws of 
humanity need support rather than punishment, it has not offered 
anything instead. A system of aid to those who have hit the 
social bottom was never set up, and thousands of people who 
found themselves not only below the poverty line but also 
outside of normal human existence were now completely left to 
their own devices. 
  Left unattended, the illness progressed rapidly, however, 
and 
in the end it became impossible to ignore it any longer. The 
first to sound the alarm were Moscow health care practitioners. 
Thousands of homeless that flooded the streets dramatically 
exacerbated the health and hygiene situation in the capital and 
became walking carriers of the most dangerous diseases. The 
first case of cholera in Moscow in many years, in which the 
disease turned out to be caused by local sources rather than 
brought in from other regions, was diagnosed last year in a 
homeless man. Research shows that each Moscow vagrant carries a 
bouquet of five or six diseases. Almost 100 percent of homeless 
suffer from pediculosis, or, to put it plainly, infestation with 
lice. The same goes for tuberculosis. As early as the middle of 
1992 a calculation was presented to the collegium of Russia's 
Ministry of Health Care, according to which an estimated 40,000 
homeless with an open form of tuberculosis were roaming the 
country. The number of homeless in the country certainly has not 
declined since then, and, in the opinion of physicians, this was 
the main factor contributing to the fact that the curve of 
incidence of tuberculosis in the country has headed sharply 
upward. 
  Finally, the problem that had already become a plague of big 
cities was noticed at the top. On 2 November 1993, Edict of the 
President of Russia No. 1815 "On Measures of Prevention of 
Vagrancy and Begging" was issued; a month later it was 
duplicated by a Moscow Government decree of the same name. These 
documents could have come out much earlier, but the fathers of 
the nation, busy with important state affairs, fly on airplanes 
and almost never happen to pass through a railway station, and 
one cannot really see from the window of a government limousine 
the horror that is taking place today in underground crossings 
and around subway stations. However, whether even these belated 
directives will be carried out is unclear. According to the 
Government of Moscow decree, two branches of the holding 
facility, each with the capacity to accommodate 80-100 persons, 
are to be opened in Moscow before 1 March 1994. Despite the fact 
that the deadline is approaching, however, the addresses of the 
new institutions that are supposed to open their doors to the 
Moscow homeless are still not known, and facilities have not 
been allocated for them. Not everything has been worked out 
regarding the creation of a system of social support for the 
current inhabitants of the streets either. 
  The president's decree envisages the function of the militia 
being limited to identifying, detaining, and bringing those 
engaged in vagrancy and begging to centers of social 
rehabilitation. There are no such centers as yet, and it is 
envisaged setting them up on the basis of the same holding 
facilities. The latter circumstance causes the greatest doubts 
among MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] specialists: it is 
unlikely that social protection service workers, who are 
predominantly female and will replace militiamen, will be able 
to handle easily the rather disagreeable population of the 
holding facility. Especially considering that most current 
homeless carry the luggage of an extensive criminal past. Among 
those who passed through the Moscow holding facility in 1993, 
66.4 percent had prior convictions, and among men this indicator 
came close to the 100-percent mark. In addition, a check showed 
that 108 persons, that is one in 13, were fugitives, with 
criminal cases against them still open. 
  There is, however, a grain of utility in bringing social 
services to work with the homeless. Because the problem of 
people who have found themselves outside regular society is 
first and foremost a social one, and the militia alone cannot 
solve it. Holding facility workers who sent their wards for job 
placement have more than once picked them up time and again in 
the slums. It is hard for a person who has been a vagrant for 
many years to start a new life from scratch, and many 
deliberately choose the street again. But even for those who 
want to get back to normal life, this is very difficult to 
accomplish: one can fall out of it almost without noticing, but 
it is practically impossible to get back. 
  The banal phrase that socioeconomic crisis always is 
accompanied by impoverishment of the popular masses no longer 
sounds banal when real human faces fill the background behind 
the dry figures of declining production and gross national 
product. And once again, like 100 years ago, today's outcasts 
are digging into trash heaps, collecting alms in chewed-up caps, 
drinking moonshine, and sleeping on street cobblestones. 
Homeless Russia, the Russia of slums and gateways, of trash 
containers and people dying at rail stations, has already become 
the mirror of the Russia of limousines, casinos, and gold 
Rolexes. Both were born in front of our very eyes. But which one 
should we call the new Russia?

<F P=106> [Article by Inna Rozanova: "A Bitter Mixture from the </F>
Barbaric Market: How Hucksters Do Business in Medicines"] 
  [Text] Panadol, fever-reducing tablets--3,000 rubles [R], 
Neo-angin for the throat--6,000, Galazolin for a cold--1,000, 
the cough mixture Bronkholitin--2,500. Such are the prices for 
medicines for the common cold in pharmacies of the capital today. 
  But what about people with more serious maladies? Where are 
they to get this money during the times of this wild market and 
the merciless prices of medicines? After all, even the most 
ordinary No-Shpa now costs R3,000-4,000, the stomach preparation 
Festal--28,000, Nootropil for improving the memory--26,000, 
Moditen, a preparation with a psychotropic effect--R40,000, and 
the antitumor preparation Ziniristin--R117,000. There are even 
more costly medicines--for the antitumor preparation 
Litoksantron they are asking more than R2 million. 
  Are such prices always justified? State controller-price 
setters, conducting planned inspections throughout the country, 
state: There are now too many people in Russia wanting to line 
their pockets at the expense of those who are ill. 
  The most expensive medicines in our country are imported. 
State procurements through imports used to be subsidized from 
the budget and the prices were relatively low. Now the subsidies 
have been abolished. The state regulates only the level of the 
trade markup, but the price asked by Western firms or buyers is 
determined by supply and demand. 
  Many of the former domestic medicines have become imports. 
Plants on the territory of the Soviet Union specialized in 
particular kinds of medications. Now more than two-thirds of 
these plants are outside the Russian Federation. 
  In order to put a stop to energetic people who make a 
business out of pharmaceuticals and thus to protect the 
population from arbitrary prices, the government has adopted a 
decision to regulate prices of medicines. The rules of the game 
are very simple: Domestic manufacturing enterprises must deliver 
medicines to wholesalers at a price no more than the production 
cost plus 30 percent. In turn, pharmacies have been ordered to 
sell the preparations to the population at no more than 1.5 
times the wholesale factory price of the producer. 
  It is only possible to verify the correctness of the price 
in 
each specific case. It sometimes happens that at neighboring 
pharmacies the prices for the same medicine differ severalfold, 
but there can be quite legitimate reasons for this. After all, 
although domestic producers also work "under scrutiny" of the 
state, with a restriction on profitability, they still purchase 
raw materials at free prices, including through exchanges. 
Therefore batches of one and the same medicine from one and the 
same plant, even if they are produced only a couple of days 
apart, can have completely different factory wholesale prices. 
  According to the law the penalty for exceeding the trade 
markup is paid by the pharmacy--the last link in the commercial 
chain. It most frequently happens that the pharmacies are left 
with the last little bits of the total markup. As a result it 
turns out that this trading point is not able to pay its 
expenses. The majority of pharmacies in the country operate at a 
loss and local administrative organs have to cover their costs. 
But since the local administration does not always have enough 
money for this, the real prices of the medicines in pharmacies 
frequently exceed the amounts of the established markups. 
  When it comes to the northern and remote regions of the 
country that are accessible only by aircraft, this is a special 
problem. Transportation costs of delivering medicines there 
sometimes turn out to be several times higher than the factory 
wholesale price of the manufacturing plant. Local authorities 
must deal with this problem as well. For example, the Council of 
Ministers of the Republic of Komi, arbitrarily and with the 
consent of its Supreme Soviet, permitted them to apply free 
trade markups of an average of up to 300 percent. And the 
government of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), conversely, 
established and introduced fixed retail prices for 260 kinds of 
medicines. This means that in Yakutia pharmacies are subsidized 
from the local budget. 
  But Yakutia and Komi are special regions, the local 
authorities are not asleep at the wheel there, they have the 
situation under control. It is another matter when individual 
pharmacies apply arbitrary trade markups without permission and 
thus profit from those who are suffering. For example, BAZL, a 
small enterprise that is a limited liability partnership from 
Bratsk in Irkutsk Oblast, when selling medicines applied an 
arbitrary trade markup of from 200 to 1,500 percent. As a 
result, in just a half year the total excess of prices amounted 
to more than R2 million. 
  As was discovered as a result of a state inspection, the 
Zelenograd pharmacy from a satellite city of the capital by the 
same name sold the medicine Novopassit at 23 times the wholesale 
price, and pharmacy No. 422 from the same population point 
"gladdened" the buyers of the preparation Nikodin by exceeding 
the factory wholesale price as much as 29-fold. 
  An inspection of one-tenth of the Moscow pharmacy network 
showed that 70 percent of the pharmacies are violating the law 
by applying trade markups in excess of the maximum level. As a 
result of this the population was overcharged more than R16 
million. 
  There is no doubt that the pharmacies, like the producers of 
the medicines, are having to return their illegally obtained 
profit and are being fined in the same amount. 
  The deliberate raising of the trade markup by the pharmacies 
is only the most primitive of all the possible financial tricks. 
Much more clever machinations can occur in any of the links of 
the trade chain, including at the level of the 
intermediary-wholesalers. For example, the joint venture 
Panta-Vitamin was created in July 1993 in order to sell products 
of the Moscow Endocrine Plant. This plant was one of the 
founders and, a month later, by August, 82 percent of all the 
products produced by the plant were sold through the joint 
venture. By raising the prices of medicines over such a short 
period of time the schemers from Panta-Vitamin were able to 
overcharge the pharmacies a total of R2.5 million, the 
wholesalers--R176.4 million, and private individuals--R29,200. 
In addition to the fine the price controllers made the 
Panta-Vitamin joint venture pay R357.8 million into the budget. 
  Machinations are also possible against a background of 
privatization and the founding of "fake" joint-stock companies. 
The manager of pharmacy No. 477 in the city of Zelenograd, N. 
Suvorova, and her accomplices, illegally, without consent from 
the Moscow Government, decided to change the 
organizational-legal form of the institution entrusted to her, 
forming the Central Pharmacy joint-stock company. At the same 
time the energetic manager founded another joint-stock company, 
on the same premises, but with a different name--Vitafarm. The 
business was organized, as it were, simply but tastefully. A 
one-sided "exchange" of goods took place between these 
joint-stock companies. Central Pharmacy, receiving medicines 
that were in critical short supply with subsidies from the 
budget, turned them over to Vitafarm--and here they were not shy 
about jacking up the prices as far as they would go. 
  True, frequently the pharmacies had to violate the law by 
not 
requiring their suppliers to indicate the prices of the 
manufacturing plants in the payment documents. This happens when 
medicines that are in critically short supply are offered to 
them by exchanges or intermediaries working with foreign goods. 
They give only their final price. And what they pay the 
manufacturer for the goods--this is their trade secret. 
  Frequently the medical workers themselves try to feather 
their nests from medicines, operating according to the principle 
"what they do not know will not hurt them." How do prescription 
medications end up in the bags of those people who are selling 
them directly at the doors to the pharmacies? There are plenty 
of "loopholes" for underhanded people. 
  What ways of lowering the cost of medicines are suggested by 
experts from the former Russian State Committee on Prices? They 
think that it is undoubtedly necessary for the state to monitor 
the prices of manufacturing plants and the level of markups for 
the trade network. Fines should be imposed not only on 
enterprises and organizations that violate the price-setting 
procedure but also on specific officials who contribute to these 
violations. This right has been granted to organs for monitoring 
prices by the Law of the Russian Federation "On Making Changes 
and Additions to Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation in 
Connection with Clarifying Liability for Illegal Trade." 
Specialists recommend that the pharmacies switch to direct 
deliveries of medications from the production plants--but this 
is difficult right now, especially in outlying areas. The fact 
that the pharmacies do not have enough of their own funds to 
purchase medicines and the high cost of bank credit are also 
unsolved problems. 
  Until we manage to beat inflation we will remain far away 
from the ideal system of prices for medications that exists in 
developed countries. There prices of medications are fixed--this 
is linked mainly to medical insurance. The cost of the 
medications included on the "insurance list" is balanced between 
supply and demand. 
  There is no doubt that at this point our state is capable of 
helping purchase medicines only for disabled persons, veterans, 
and other underprivileged citizens by granting them the 
opportunity to obtain medicine free of charge or with a 
considerable rebate. But this certainly does not mean that 
anybody can take advantage of our problems to feather their 
nests.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Dobyndo, deputy director of </F>
Body-Assembly Production of the Volga Passenger Vehicle 
Production Association, by Sergey Bystrov, TRUD correspondent: 
"VAZ After Conveyor Start-Up"] 
  [Text] The second work week at AvtoVAZ this year 
ended today. Only the second, because the motor vehicle giant 
delayed the start for a whole month. This was a mild shock to 
the country. But what about the plant? In general, what awaits 
it, its motor vehicles and our motor vehicle fans? Our TRUD 
correspondent interviews Mikhail Dobyndo, deputy director of 
body-assembly production of the Volga Passenger Vehicle 
Production Association. 
  [Bystrov] Mikhail Nikolayevich, the future of AvtoVAZ is, 
after all, the future of all our passenger vehicle building as 
well. We suddenly learn that our motor vehicle giant, perhaps 
even as a surprise to itself, is begining to stumble. What has 
happened to it? 
  [Dobyndo] As the person responsible for the direct finished 
output of motor vehicles, and as deputy production director, I 
would in this situation still single VAZ out from the complex of 
problems which exist around us as a whole today. We stood idle 
for a month, fearing that complications might arise with the 
start-up of the equipment, because the conveyor had never before 
been shut down for such a long time. For planned repair work, 
for two to three days -- of course. But this was for a month. 
The conveyor came to a standstill. Large-scale repair work on it 
was in full swing -- it was being modernized. Naturally, we 
feared for the control system: it was easy to disturb it and 
hard to put it right, and we also feared some sort of unexpected 
losses. This does happen. Nevertheless, we started it up 
successfully and did the entire program for a whole week. I 
don't remember having done a program for a whole week running 
like that in the last five or six years. Last Saturday, we even 
had to shut down the conveyor 45 minutes early, so that we would 
not put out superfluous motor vehicles. 
  This indicates that the plant has lost nothing on the 
organizational-technical plane. It has not lost its traditions 
or its stability, and most important -- has not lost its people. 
The plant will operate -- we have no doubt of that. 
  As for matters linked with price formation, with product 
sales and with non-payment problems -- they are very critical 
for us even today, and they are holding us back. 
  In the first week we assembled 12,500 cars, and sold 7,000 
at 
best. Not only do we now have finished vehicles parked in 
fenced-off areas, we have gone out beyond them. This is because 
we don't have the proper sales. Before the new year we had 
uncompleted cars standing in the same place, but now they are 
marketable ones. It is already a bit easier. True, even now we 
have some things not completed, but that is all right: for 
example, there is no upholstery in the trunk compartment, nor 
cigarette lighters. 
  Money is coming in with paralyzing slowness, however, even 
for the goods that have been sold. This year we began to receive 
payments only after 25 January. After all, the supplier plants 
have no money either, and cannot get started without it. But the 
money was late coming to us, and it is late getting to them. We 
had to seek internal reserves. On 4 February, a trilateral 
agreement on delaying wage payments was signed between the 
administration, in the person of our president, the production 
council and the trade-union committee. Wages for our plant now 
constitute about 25 billion rubles [R]. We have not paid wages 
for January to those who were working, and we did not pay for 
December. We paid only monetary allowances. It was decided in 
February to pay half of the wage for December and January. This 
will give us a saving in the order of R15 billion, which can be 
thrown in to help the suppliers. In March, however, we will try 
to pay the rest. Our people were understanding about this. 
  [Bystrov] It is clear that your main problem is creating 
normal conditions for conveyor operation. When these conditions 
do not exist, it causes great difficulties for the plant. Can it 
be that some sort of basic changes are needed? And moreover, 
quickly, while work is going on? Let us say, with that very 
non-liquidity of the product? 
  [Dobyndo] How did our plant's non-liquidity form? Primarily 
because we have lost the market of the former Union. It used to 
be that only about 40 percent of our motor vehicle sales were 
made in Russia. Last year we sold 97 percent of all the sales on 
the territory of the former USSR in the Russian Federation. We 
have completely lost Ukraine and all the southern republics, 
including Kazakhstan. Why? It is the same problem of 
non-payment. The problem of unstable currency. There is no 
clear-cut mechanism for clearing operations between the former 
republics. Even though we receive from Ukraine, let us say, a 
lot of completing items (all the wiring for the motor vehicles 
and the zinc-plating for the gas tanks come from there), we get 
it for payments. We generally settle accounts with the 
neighboring countries in full, mainly with commodities. Today 
this is not very profitable, because this does not allow our 
sales offices to develop normally or study the market. We are 
forced to be attached to monopolists, who hold us back. 
  The Russian motor vehicle market for us today is almost 
saturated. I don't think that our motor vehicles are too 
expensive right now. They were expensive when, beginning on 1 
November last year, we very sharply raised the price level, 
thereby virtually suspending shipments and sales for two months. 
In the past we would follow inflation, but still lagging behind 
it, we raised the prices by 15-20 percent almost every two 
months. For us this process delayed sales by about a week or 
two. In November, however, not counting on the stabilization of 
the ruble exchange rate, we decided to create for ourselves the 
conditions for stable work, at least for one quarter. Our 
desires, however, were not realized. Still, we can see that 
everything around us is in much worse shape than our motor 
vehicle plant. 
  [Bystrov] Will you perhaps now have to take special care of 
your independence in all your relations? After all, it is to be 
hoped that the economy surrounding the plant will stabilize 
quickly? 
  [Dobyndo] Formally, we now have enough independence. We have 
the independence to make all our decisions. If, however, by this 
you mean economic self-provision, it cannot help but depend on 
the situation in Russia in general. In any developed country, 
the motor vehicle industry is an indicator of the state of the 
entire economy and the state of industry. Our country, it seems 
to me, does not want to think about this. Any motor vehicle 
industry, in the time of its crisis, enjoys powerful financial 
support from the state. Right now Chrysler and Ford are working 
on the creation of a motor vehicle for the next century. They 
have powerful support from the state. This does not happen in 
our country. Apparently, it feels: whoever comes to the surface 
will swim out. Very serious destruction of industry continues. 
After all, while VAZ once provided 1 percent of the gross 
national income, today, together with our subcontractors, we 
provide 10 percent of Russia's gross national income. Even under 
these conditions, they don't show all that much concern for us, 
and it is difficult to survive. 
  What funds did we have for development up to now? We had 
enough from what was sold on the domestic market for our 
internal consumption and development without reproduction. 
(After all, we are left 18 kopecks from the ruble, and the other 
82 kopecks go for taxes, for inordinately high taxes. When we 
ask the state for help, we are merely asking it to return part 
of what it took from us.) We obtained the funds for reproduction 
from export sales. Because reproduction is primarily the 
reproduction of technology -- and you need currency here. 
  But while the state formerly took almost all the profits 
from 
us, one could "break loose" money from it, and quite a lot, for 
the development of any sort of programs. To be sure, when 
readying the VAZ 2110 model, we counted on the appropriate help. 
According to all the schedules, the motor vehicle should already 
have come off the main conveyor, and this year we planned on 
coming out with the planned output of the "Ten." We had bought 
virtually all the equipment, and moreover, a long time ago. It 
has been lying around our plant for over 18 months now, that is, 
the equipment manufacturer's warranty period has already passed. 
There were no funds. When we start pinching from the cash boxes, 
we don't know what will happen. In general, though, we have no 
funds at all for development. For the first time we have begun 
to sell currency, in order to ensure normal production. 
  With any foreign partner, a contract is concluded when 
deferred payments are stipulated. Moreover, they are solid. It 
is normal practice throughout the world. In Russia, however, 
there is pre-payment everywhere. Where can we get it? Who will 
give it to us? 
  I realize that from the monetary standpoint, any state 
infusion today causes some additional percentage of inflation. 
Without it, though, industry cannot develop. Where, when, which 
belt should be shut down, which one intensified -- this is the 
art of those who are responsible for reform in the country. 
  [Bystrov] I understand that the plant's future rests on the 
"Ten," and that without this step, the next ones are almost 
impossible? 
  [Dobyndo] The "Ten" is not the future of the plant, but a 
necessary step, without which we will lose the sales market. 
This year Russia seems to be protected from the influx of 
foreign makes. Our future is the next motor vehicle and 
extensive modernization of the plant and the assembly conveyor, 
at least the second belt, where the "Five" and the "Seven" are 
assembled. It is still hard to say, though, when this future 
will be traced out. The second future is connected with the 
production of the "Niva." At this production site, modernization 
will begin in literally two or three years, in order to produce 
the lengthened "Niva" in accordance with the standard for normal 
modern "jeeps." And with a new engine, up to two liters, etc. At 
the same time, a separate assembly plant should continue to 
produce 100,000 "Sixes" for the domestic market, so that we have 
money. We have the capacities for this. 
  These are the prospects, although the situation may change 
at 
any moment. The "Ten" has already been created, it has only to 
be launched on the flowline. The quicker that happens, the more 
profitable for the plant, the consumer and the country. 
  [Bystrov] The most important question for VAZ right now is 
the transition to new technology, for after all, the basis of 
the existing technology has its roots in the late 1960's. Modern 
technology, though means cutting back the number of people in 
the production process. This is a good thing, as long as people 
don't suffer. What awaits the plant here? 
  [Dobyndo] Yes, the fewer people employed in production, the 
more improved the technology. We will have no superfluous 
people. It is enough to remember that the AVVA program requires 
a huge number of specialists. This means we must fight 
resolutely to cut back the number of workers in the shops. 
  Where do we see reserves? In the first place, welding. 
Today, 
we have about 800 people working in the shop producing the 
"Six," but for the same program for the "Eight" and the "Ten" we 
have half the number of people working in the shop. True, there 
are more mechanics here, and very highly skilled ones. In the 
new, modern shops, however, if we succeed in stocking them up, 
the program for 200,000 motor vehicles a year can be ensured 
with only about 100 people. In the second place, painting. Today 
Chrysler, it is true, has just a little less than our capacity, 
and employs 56 people, but in our plant -- there are almost 800. 
In the third place, assembly. All modern motor vehicle plants 
today operate translifts -- self-powered electric bogies, which 
run on monorails according to their own program. There are none 
of these pusher conveyors, no weighting of structures and no 
interweaving of conveyors aloft or unnecessary service 
personnel. There must be translifts, because one can't manage 
without them, even though the principle of the conveyor remains 
the same as in our plant, for even in the West they have not 
been able to think up anything better. On the other hand, 
though, "wheeled technology" has long been in existence there. 
That is, there are no warehouse facilities. The transport unit 
which delivered the completing items to the conveyor is the 
warehouse. 
  [Bystrov] There was a time when you delivered completing 
items by air. This kind of "wheeled technology," however, is a 
very expensive pleasure. 
  [Dobyndo] Right now, unfortunately, the situation is the 
same. We use planes and helicopters. This is where the expense 
lies, and we should by all means eliminate it. 
  [Bystrov] The problem of supplies of completing items is in 
general a sore point for any plant. As far as we can see, mass 
losses of suppliers are taking place these days. Won't you also 
have to lose them or change them? 
  [Dobyndo] It is not that easy to change suppliers today, 
even 
if you feel like it. Those same bundles of electric wires from 
Kamenets-Podolskiy. The motor vehicle plant's currency funds 
were invested there, and all the cooperation ensuring the output 
of these bundles is directed there today. What does it mean to 
organize this type of production all over again today, let us 
say, in Russia? A lot of time and capital. Is it necessary? 
International cooperation is branching out all over the world. I 
do not think that we have to take a different path. Our plant 
always had the policy: develop our own suppliers, in order to 
raise the level of the motor vehicle as a whole. It is simply 
senseless to lose what we have invested now. On the contrary, we 
are striving to help our suppliers, we are now tracing the 
entire chain of suppliers from the ore to the finished item 
which comes to us, in order to ensure uninterrupted supply. It 
is a very difficult matter, but we are forced to deal with it. 
  At the same time, of course, we are gradually developing a 
network of suppliers, and are also using defense enterprises for 
this. We have set up Lada-Konversiya, a joint venture, with 
headquarters in Moscow, which deals with working out a program 
of interaction. Possibly, in time, we will revise something 
somewhere, but it is simply impossible and purposeless to change 
mass supply immediately. After all, cooperation unites not only 
our economy, but also our people, so that supply volumes, 
including those with former socialist countries, even with the 
former Yugoslavia, are not cut down anywhere. 
  [Bystrov] Will it be somewhat easier for the All-Russian 
Motor Vehicle Alliance than for you? 
  [Dobyndo] If they manage to put the business on a normal 
market basis, then it will, of course, be considerably easier 
for them. Their starting point is different from that of the 
plant. The plant has piled up its losses in the last few years. 
The president signed an edict on the AVVA and on the motor 
vehicle plant, which removes the excise tax and all taxes on 
products made for development of the AVVA. Loans are provided 
for.... 
  In the last few years we have long been trying to find some 
sort of foreign partner for normal investment and development. 
It seemed that we were just on the point of signing an agreement 
with Fiat -- it did not happen, and then we were close to 
signing a contract with West German firms. Why? The motor 
vehicle plant still seemed to them an unreliable structure, even 
after it became a joint-stock company, because as before, state 
psychology was still retained there. The AVVA, however, is a 
completely new psychology, a new level of relations, virtually 
that very capitalization which organizes them. Our technical 
level is no lower than that at foreign plants, and the level of 
our specialists is quite high. Foreign firms are now after 
contacts, on their initiative, because they can see: this is 
precisely the form of ownership which the AVVA will have, which 
guarantees the investment of capital. There is a 
military-industrial complex with its own assets, there is the 
plant with its own assets.... This is an absolutely 
denationalized structure. 
  [Bystrov] Everyone hopes that the All-Russian Motor Vehicle 
Alliance will, all the same, produce vehicles that the people 
can afford. There are few people who can afford yours at this 
time. 
  [Dobyndo] Inflation will do its job, and our motor vehicle 
will again become affordable for the buyer. Even before, 
however, our vehicle was not affordable for the population 
masses. 
  [Bystrov] Even recently, though, almost every worker would 
put his name down on the waiting list for a Zhigul. 
  [Dobyndo] Yes, he put his name down because they were 
selling 
in a different way. At that time a motor vehicle, under the 
conditions of its scarcity, had two prices: the state price and 
the market price. The latter was sometimes three-fold higher. 
One out of a thousand, however, had the chance of buying a new 
vehicle at the state price. Even at the state price, many people 
acquired a car on borrowed money, to part with their purchase at 
a profit later, thereby putting his material situation in order. 
  In general, however, we always delayed in establishing 
prices 
for our motor vehicle, so that its wholesale factory price would 
constantly be lower than the market price. Only last year did we 
anticipate the market with respect to prices and we therefore 
slowed down sales. The plant is not free to dictate prices, 
though. There is a lower limit, which production expenses 
restrict, and there is an upper limit, restricted by buyer 
capability. This interval is very narrow, and we must not only 
be able to survive within it, but also to expand it, for freer 
maneuvering. The country needs our motor vehicle. Without it 
Russia will never be truly independent. It is not an easy task. 
But what is easy today?

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Menshov, chief engineer of the </F>
"Severovostokzoloto" Association, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent 
Vladimir Androsenko: "The Hen Has Laid Golden Eggs..."] 
  [Text] Magadan--The gold mining industry of the 
Northeast survived in 1993, in spite of the tremendous 
difficulties. Extraction of the precious metal in Magadan 
Oblast, together with Chukotka, decreased by nearly 3,500 
kilograms to a total of 40 metric tons (about one-third of all 
Russian production). With the extraordinary increase in prices 
for fuel, equipment, and materials, the mining enterprises lost 
stability, but remained afloat. 
  "So some hopeful signs have appeared in the Far North's 
economy, and miners can look to the future with greater 
confidence now?" Our correspondent began an interview with 
Aleksandr Menshov, chief engineer of the "Severovostokzoloto" 
Association, with this question. 
  [Menshov] We cannot speak about normalization of the mining 
industry yet. Gold mining enterprises in the Far North can 
produce output only during the summer, during the placer season. 
The rest of the year we get ready for the season: we work the 
stripping rock, we bring gold-bearing sands up to the surface 
from the pits, and we repair the equipment. 
  But since the money for the metal is received only after it 
is sold, all this must be done on credit. This is where the 
stumbling block is. 
  The miners themselves are not in a position to finance the 
expenditures for future periods; after paying all the taxes and 
levies, they have hardly enough for minimal social needs. 
Consequently, the question concerns the sources for financing 
these outlays. If the government--the main buyer of our 
product--gives us an advance payment, the enterprises will 
function and Russia will have gold. If it does not, it will have 
nothing. 
  Last year the Komdragmet [Committee on Precious Metals and 
Precious Stones] understood this clear dependence, it financed 
us on time, and the results are apparent. The association cut 
back extraction of the metal by 8 percent when there was a 
downturn of 20 and 30 percent at the Bilibino and Polyarnyy 
Mining and Concentration Combines, which had left the 
"Severovostokzoloto" organization and did not receive the proper 
support. But now there has been no advance payment, and 
stripping has already decreased by 10 percent in January, 
compared with last year. 
  The sector's collapse has not been ruled out altogether. A 
Komdragmet representative told gold mining managers at a 
conference on 17 December 1993 that a minimum of half the funds 
needed would be provided before 15 February. We also formed our 
economic policy on the basis of this promise. But by the end of 
January it was suddenly revealed that there would be no money 
and that the Komdragmet is just beginning its search for credit. 
But is this any way to conduct business? We have been literally 
driven into a corner, after all. 
  [Androsenko] Aleksandr Aleksandrovich, according to some 
reports, a government decree is being prepared which authorizes 
the banks to purchase gold from its producers. Does this mean 
that our government wants to shift some of the expenses to the 
businessmen as well? 
  [Menshov] I am deeply convinced that such a decision will be 
very detrimental to state interests. Yes, at first glance, 
considerable savings are indicated for the budget: by 
stipulating its right to purchase 50 percent of the metal, the 
state thereby reduces the amount of its advance payment. These 
are sizable sums: for example, we now need 210 billion rubles 
[R] in last December's prices. 
  It seems profitable, especially as the commercial banks are 
ready and willing to finance the gold miners for the remainder 
of our output. But in reality, there is no benefit here. A huge 
profit is simply slipping into private hands. 
  Think about it: we are selling gold at R15,000 per gram--at 
its current world price. But the price of a gram is already more 
than R50,000 in the jewelry stores. And this difference will 
exist for quite a long period of time. At present, two-thirds of 
the market value of gold items is supplementing the Russian 
budget, but if the decree you mentioned is issued, this will 
begin filling the pockets of the businessmen. 
  I think that concern for the budget should force the 
government to reject this undertaking and return to the previous 
system of financing and settlements. But this must be done more 
quickly, for time is more valuable than money now. 
  [Androsenko] It is no secret that the "Severovostokzoloto" 
enterprises are operating mainly at placer deposits. We cannot 
speak about increasing the proportion of bedrock deposits 
because of the high capital-output ratio. The association was 
not able to offer anything even to develop the "Kubaka" with its 
100 metric tons of easily extracted gold, and this tidbit went 
to a Russian-American joint venture. So you are destined to 
"fade away" at the placers to the extent that they are depleted? 
  [Menshov] For the first time last year, we extracted more 
metal than we increased reserves during the entire gold season 
in the Kolyma. This was the result of the breakdown in 
geological work, not the exhaustion of natural resources. But 
we have enough, even of the reserves that have already been 
explored and protected, for a good 20 to 25 years. Of course, 
the quality of the placers is declining: their gold content is 
decreasing, and more stripping must be done. 
  Our only chance is to reduce the production cost of mining. 
In particular, we have now developed a new technology for 
extracting the metal without the use of cyanides. Its 
introduction will make it possible to reduce the cost of 
production by nearly one-half. There are other advanced ideas as 
well. But you are right: the tendencies to "fade away" may turn 
out to be quite strong. The causes are rooted in the unhealthy 
principles in organizing the economy. 
  As an example, we have not actually modernized our fixed 
capital for 3 years now. There is no money. The level of taxes 
now is such that simply nothing is left for reproduction and 
development. But using credits means hanging a millstone around 
our necks. 
  Take the "Kubaka." We need a minimum of $100 million--R150 
billion--to develop it. Commercial loans are now provided at a 
minimum of 213 percent interest per annum. The maximum 
extraction of gold there is 8 to 10 metric tons annually. Taken 
at today's prices, the entire cost of production will be less 
than it costs just to service the debt. Is this really 
conceivable for a producer? 
  After all, a joint venture undertook to develop the deposit 
only because the American side was able to obtain normal, 
civilized loans at 6 percent interest for the program. But by 
dealing with Russian commercial sharks, the SP [joint venture] 
would be bankrupt right away. After all, this involves deposits 
which are superprofitable by world standards. But what can we 
say about our placers then? 
  But after all, the farther we go, the worse it is. Thus far 
over 50 percent of the product's value has been collected in the 
form of taxes, a little over 37 percent has made up the 
production cost, 10 percent has gone to maintain the social 
infrastructure, and 1.5 to 2 percent has been used to assist 
those with low incomes and pensioners "on the mainmland," to pay 
for containers, and so forth. 
  In 1994, according to our calculations, the tax on property 
alone will be increased by at least 24 times as much because of 
the reassessment of fixed capital announced by the government. 
The rates of the tax on profit are also being increased. 
Production cost will rise sharply, for the new tax system will 
force our suppliers to raise the price of their products. 
  There is one more negative factor. It is no secret to 
economists that the Ministry of Finance has been supporting the 
understated exchange rate of the dollar until very recently. I 
do not know in whose interests this is, but it is clearly not in 
the interests of the domestic producer. Let us say that 
transactions with us for gold are conducted at the world price 
on the basis of such a regulated exchange rate. But at the same 
time, we are purchasing petroleum products, materials, and 
equipment at prices which are twice the world prices. Where is 
the logic? After all, this is not a struggle to normalize the 
economy at all, for inflation and the budget deficit only 
increase to the extent that production volumes decrease, and 
unbalanced prices exert a direct influence on this. 
  So I can definitely state that the main reason that gold 
mining enterprises will "fade away," if this takes place, will 
not be the exhaustion of natural resources, but economic policy. 
  [Androsenko] Aleksandr Aleksandrovich, the 
"Severovostokzoloto" Association was almost broken apart into 
numerous fragments as the result of purposeful pressure "from 
the top." Fortunately, you managed to stop the process of 
self-destruction, but voices calling for reunification are 
already being heard today in the enterprises that left from 
under your "wing." What has happened? 
  [Menshov] Yes, they are speaking more insistently about 
returning at the Polyarnyy and Bilibino GOK's [mining and 
concentration combines]. The Dukat GOK has stated unequivocally 
that it will become part of a holding company after shareholding 
is introduced in the form of a joint-stock company. Discussions 
among the prospectors about the separation have been 
discontinued. We now have 202 artels in operation, and a total 
of 21 have left us. The solution is quite simple: one cannot 
survive alone in the North. 
  "Severovostokzoloto" has maintained ties with its suppliers 
and is working with them without middlemen, which is 
significantly cheaper and faster. By combining the enterprises' 
funds, we can deliver everything needed in time and thereby 
ensure uninterrupted production. How can an individual GOK pay a 
billion rubles in advance for a steamship carrying explosives? 
But together we are finding this money. We have paid in full for 
the tankers coming to Magadan. 
  They attempt to accuse us of monopolism here, because we use 
this fuel ourselves and do not share it with anyone--but after 
all, these are normal market relationships. Why should we supply 
others to the detriment of our placers and artels? It is hard 
for them now, but after all, this is because they left us at one 
time in search of an easier life. 
  There is none in the North, and there cannot be under 
extreme 
natural and climatic conditions. Alas, it is not to no purpose 
that popular wisdom divides those who learn from others' 
mistakes and those who prefer to make their own. We are not 
gloating: what pleasure can there be here when everything that 
has been built up is being ruined, and when our economic space 
is being removed? And we are always prepared to unite on 
sensible principles to survive together. 
  [Androsenko] Over the past 3 years the territory has lost 
one-quarter of its population. People are leaving because they 
are tired of the North, the general disorganization, the poor 
supply, and most imporantly, the lack of confidence in the 
future, the lack of prospects. But how do the miners feel? 
  [Menshov] Like everyone else. They are hoping that the 
government will be sensible. And the authorities must be more 
honest, too. They should be direct in stating whether Russia 
needs the North's gold and act in accordance with this. 
  The situation here is very simple: the lack of financing in 
advance means the treasury does not have 40 metric tons of the 
precious metal. Delaying the advance until May means reducing 
the output by 40 percent. Only it is not necessary to speak 
about the unprofitability of its production for the budget. I 
have already mentioned the comparative prices for gold in 
selling to the state and by the state. 
  I will also remind you that half of the money we receive 
goes 
for taxes--and the budget--right away. A substantial part of the 
budgetary income is hidden in the production cost (through the 
tax payments of our suppliers) and in the income tax on gold 
miners' wages. 
  Our sector is truly the hen laying golden eggs for the 
country. It can be killed, of course. But then we must question 
the responsibility of its owners.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Konorov on round table meeting conducted at </F>
the Ministry and Technical Policy: "Will We Have Our Own 
Newtons?"] 
  [Text] A round table meeting was held at the Ministry 
of Science and Technical Policy. 
  The head of the Ministry, Boris Saltykov, who opened the 
meeting, emphasized that preserving the best part of Russia's 
scientific-technical potential in conditions of the economic 
slump is the main goal of state policy in the sphere of science 
and technology. 
  Boris Saltykov noted bitterly that because of the shortage 
of 
finances, all last year scientists had to think more about 
preserving science than developing it. 
  But even under these difficult conditions a great deal was 
accomplished. Forty-one state scientific-technical programs were 
formulated and are being realized. Proposals for realizing 117 
priority technologies and new types of output within the 
framework of the state structural policy were prepared. 
Thirty-three state scientific centers received financial 
support, and that made it possible to preserve the leading 
scientific schools in the high technology fields. 
  For the first time and as one of the first among the 
republics of the former Union, Russia became a full-fledged 
member in the European technological program "Eureka." An 
intergovernmental agreement on scientific-technical cooperation 
with the United States was concluded. Russia's international 
scientific-technical cooperation made it possible to continue 
many scientific research projects in the field of high-energy 
physics, the human genome and bioengineering, and promising 
information technologies. 
  However, the speaker noted, the situation in the 
scientific-technical sphere is becoming increasingly strained. 
Science continues to be financed month by month and on the 
left-over principle. Thus, last year scientific organizations 
received about 300 billion rubles less than needed. 
  The number of scientific personnel is also declining: both 
because of the exodus of scientists to commercial structures and 
owing to the "brain drain" abroad. The best are leaving. The 
prestige of scientific labor has dropped, the proportion of 
graduates of VUZes [higher educational institutions] which train 
scientific cadres is declining, and scientific schools and 
entire fields are collapsing. 
  The volume of enterprise contracts with scientific 
organizations has sharply declined, construction of scientific 
facilities has ceased, and unique structures are becoming 
unusable. The disruption of contacts among organizations of the 
former Union republics is causing enormous losses to science and 
technology. 
  The lack of hard currency is retarding and reducing the 
scope 
of international cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by Fedor Yemchenko: "Resuscitation After the </F>
Shock?"] 
  [Text] Replacement of certain of the actors in the 
government has elicited an ambiguous reaction from those who 
specialize in predictions. Some see in this a "recoil" from 
market reforms, others--the beginning of the next period of 
"shock-free therapy." Everyone assesses differently the 
statement of Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin to the effect that 
the state must pay back its debts. Just think--the deed 
(entirely natural, even obligatory) has not yet been done, and 
the mere promise of its fulfillment has evoked such polarized 
judgments. "Trillions are being shelled out to further develop 
the `black hole' of agriculture," one central newspaper reported 
a few days ago. But indeed, these trillions in question are not 
being "shelled out." And this is not the charity of V. 
Chernomyrdin and A. Zaveryukha, but rather a debt to the 
farmers. We are already eating the final portions of the bread 
procured from them last year. We paid for this--but to whom? Why 
did the money not reach those who made the bread? 
  At the end of last year, the ideologues of stabilization 
gladdened Russian hearts: Look, they said--we have already 
curbed inflation, and the ruble is stronger. Just a little more, 
a little bit more... But let us take a look at what stands 
behind this report of victory. What has this "thrifty economics" 
turned into for the producers? 
  My desk is covered with statements, appeals, and open 
letters 
to the president, prime minister, and ministries, which are 
similar in tone. You become dumbfounded when you read them, and 
wonder what state of deep crisis our production is in today. 
Plants are standing idle. People have not received wages for 
months. Workers are in a state of pre-strike frenzy. 
  It is not possible to enumerate everything. Let us consider 
as an example just the key sectors. Once again the voices of our 
country's miners are sounding the alarm. The coal miners' union 
recently issued a statement which reads, in part: "Our trade 
union has always strived to resolve complex problems of social 
protection for the working people on the basis of mutual 
understanding and cooperation with the government. However, 
irresponsible promises by our partners in talks and their 
infringement of the terms of the wage-scale agreement compel us 
to take up a more rigid position." 
  The rigidity of this position is today manifest in the 
active 
preparation being made for demonstrations on the part of miners 
in the Kuzbass, Vorkuta, Chita, and the Maritime Kray coal 
fields. Once again the demands of the miners are "simple": The 
state must pay back the 272 billion rubles it owes them from 
last year. Delay in this regard may result in social upheaval. 
Workers at several coal enterprises have still not received 
their pay for...October! An interdepartmental commission on 
socioeconomic problems of the coal producing regions created by 
the government is doing nothing, according to trade union 
leaders. Instead of developing a specific program, they are 
engaging in empty debate. 
  A catastrophic situation has also come about at enterprises 
of the oil and gas production industry. It turns out that the 
"oil kings" are not wearing any clothes. The most profitable 
sector in the country, one would think, providing huge amounts 
of hard currency, is presently on the verge of coming to a halt. 
Workers have not received their wages for three or four months. 
And this is in Siberia, in the regions of the Far North! 
  From 18 through 24 January, all the general directors of the 
oil and gas production and refining industries gathered together 
with specialists from the Ministry of Fuel and Energy to develop 
a program for extricating the sector out of its crisis. A 
package of documents was prepared. Unfortunately, their authors 
(as reported in the press) have not as yet been able to "get 
through" to the prime minister to have these documents signed. 
  In the meantime, you and I have believed that in "shelling 
out" significant portions of our wages at the gas pump, we have 
thereby been ensuring normal labor and living conditions for our 
oil producers. We pay conscientiously for our bread and 
gasoline, but our money is not reaching those who produce all of 
this. 
  For a long time, "shock therapy" was relatively forgiving to 
metallurgists. But rapid price increases for energy and 
increased rail transportation charges have brought this sector 
to its knees as well. No halt is seen in the production decline. 
Entire enterprises are shutting down. 
  A similar situation has come about at enterprises of the 
shipbuilding industry, in the textile, machine-building, and 
other commodity producing sectors. 
  The picture we see emerging here is an alarming one. There 
is 
cause for despair. So, should the government be criticized for 
its attempt, albeit tardy, to rescue production from certain 
collapse? And it is not "shock-free therapy" that our economy 
needs today, but real resuscitation--without turning away from 
the market, of course.

<F P=106> [Report attributed to ITAR-TASS: "Only A Shadow of the </F>
Sector Remains"] 
  [Text] The situation in Russia's machinebuilding complex 
continues to be bad, according to ITAR-TASS. About 230 
enterprises are idle and 240,000 persons are out of work. 
  This information was provided by Anatoliy Ogurtsov, chairman 
of the Russian Committee on Machinebuilding, at an expanded 
session of the collegium of this department. 
  A report prepared for the meeting by the committee's experts 
notes that production volume in the sector declined by 14.9 
percent compared with 1992. The cutback of a number of items was 
especially substantial: chiefly trucks (81 percent), bulldozers 
(53 percent), and mainline diesel engines (70 percent). The 
production of drilling rigs dropped to 45 percent and the 
production of mainline electric locomotives decreased to 33 
percent. 
  The chairman of Roskommash [Russian Committee on 
Machinebuilding] sees the establishment of financial-industrial 
groups as one of the ways to stabilize the sector. The committee 
is drafting the plans for 20 such groups. 
  The department head believes that the government should 
implement a selective state policy of support and introduce 
protective export duties on foreign machinebuilding output.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Slow Speed Is Life-Threatening"] </F>
  [Text] First a few figures. In 1993, according to 
Roskommetallurgii [Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy], 
metal consumption declined as follows compared with 1992: 
  --by 29.3 percent for rolled ferrous metals; 
  --by one-half for aluminum; 
  --by a factor of 1.7 for transportation metal; 
  --to one-quarter as much for high-strength drilling pipe; 
  --by one-half for compressor pipe; 
  --by 41 percent for rolled nonferrous metals; and 
  --by 50 percent for hard alloys and blends. 
  The list may be continued, adding more and more new items, 
but the trend is clear and alarming. An economy without metal, 
and it is a basic structural material here, is leading to a 
complete decline. 
  Each year no less than a million metric tons of rails are 
installed for Russia's railroads. This is not being done now. 
Essentially, the tracks are not being repaired as they should 
be. There are more and more sections where speeds are 
restricted. We do not hear of any new railroad lines at all. 
There are limits to pipeline transport service, where the danger 
of accidents and disasters is increasing. The construction 
industry is taking barely one-fifth of the amount of metal which 
it used previously. And there is a recession in investments. 
Russia is being deindustrialized. 
  The payments system is one of the reasons for the difficult 
economic situation. Serafim Afonin, the chairman of 
Roskommetallurgii, is convinced that the present one is wrong. 
Under market conditions, no one should have privileges. But 
electric power engineering and the railroads are taking away the 
money anyway. After all these deductions, coal and iron ore have 
to be purchased from the remains. 
  As a result, metallurgists are settling only half their 
accounts with partners in money. The other half is by exchange 
in kind. Networks of 11 units are already being set up. 
  As of 1 January 1994, metal consumers owed 4.3 trillion 
rubles [R] to the plants. The metallurgists, in turn, owe R3 
trillion to the suppliers. But taking into account what is owed 
to the budget, to the banks for nonbudgetary funds, and to 
others, the debt owed to creditors is R5.4 trillion. 
Metallurgical enterprises' own working capital declined from 
51.5 percent in 1992 to 27.3 percent in 1993. 
  But perhaps metal is not in demand anywhere in the world? Or 
our Russian steel is not competitive? Not at all! Here are a few 
figures to think about. 
  The export of ferrous metals has doubled, reaching about $4 
billion in 1993. This includes an increase of 50.6 percent to 
Asian countries, 33.9 percent to Western Europe, and 4.9 percent 
to North America. 
  The export pattern has been changed, according to materials 
from Roskommetallurgii. The proportion of rolled metal (the 
finished product) has increased to 51.3 percent, and the 
proportion of unfinished work pieces has dropped to 30 percent. 
  Several exports of nonferrous metals have decreased, but 
this 
is another subject.

<F P=106> [Article by Anna Smirnova: "Russia's Power System Will Be </F>
Partially Denationalized"] 
  [Text] The RAO "YeES Rossii" [Russian Joint-Stock Company 
for Power and Electrification] is unique in the world in terms 
of the scale and unity of its energy complex, which encompasses 
Russia's entire electrical power infrastructure. "YeES Rossii" 
includes about 70 regional power systems and about 600 thermal 
and 100 hydroelectric stations with a total capacity of 210 
million kilowatts, as well as electrical transmission lines 
approximately 2.5 million kilometers in length, and planning and 
scientific research institutes. Moreover, RAO "YeEs Rossii" has 
at its disposal large blocks of stock from the power 
construction industry and power machine building. In 1992 
electrical power output by enterprises that now belong to RAO 
"YeES Rossii" comprised about 1 trillion kilowatts per hour, and 
thermal energy -- about 790 million gigacalories. Approximately 
2 percent of electrical power was earmarked for export. 
  The Russian Joint-Stock Company for Power and 
Electrification 
(RAO "YeES Rossii"), the stock of which will be offered at check 
auction, will be the largest Russian enterprise. Already this 
winter the shares of the joint-stock society with its 70 billion 
in authorized capital will be offered at auction for vouchers. 
The auction rules were explained yesterday to reporters at a 
press conference organized by RAO "YeES Rossii." 
  RAO "YeES Rossii," organized approximately one year ago in 
accordance with an edict by the president of Russia within a 
complex of measures to denationalize the power system, is a 
unique joint-stock society. RAO "YeES Rossii" fixed capital 
includes the largest electric stations in the country as well as 
the entire network of communications that secures the 
transmission of electrical energy. RAO "YeES Rossii" claims 
authorized capital of almost 70 billion rubles and at the 
present time 87 percent has already been organized 
(contributions from the government and from regional energy 
systems). The par value of RAO "YeES Rossii" stock has been 
established at 500 rubles. 
  At the press conference held yesterday by Anatoliy 
Baranovskiy, vice president of RAO "YeES Rossii," the 
presidential edict on creating this AO [joint-stock company] 
with the controlling participation of the government was 
assessed as a logical step directed at achieving the unity and 
security of Russia's energy system. In accordance with the 
general ideology of reforming Russia's energy system and within 
the framework of creating a single technological and economic 
space, RAO "YeES Rossii" intends to institute cooperation among 
its daughter companies, which will be organized as regional 
energy complexes. Regional and federal analytic commissions, 
which will establish local rates for services by the power 
network and for the transmission of electrical power, will be 
created to regulate the operations of these daughter companies. 
  At the check auction for RAO "YeES Rossii" stock, which in 
all likelihood will take place already this winter, 20 percent 
of the total AO stock will be put on the market (at a value of 
slightly less than 14 billion rubles). There are no plans for 
the participation of foreign investors at this stage. 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts believe that one of the most active 
participants in the auction will be the labor collectives of 
enterprises that make up RAO "YeES Rossii" (total number of 
employees comprises about 1 million people). It should be noted 
that even before the carrying out of the check auction, RAO 
"YeES Rossii" decided to concern itself with the secondary 
market infrastructure for its stock. Thus, at the present time 
the AO administration is examining the question of concluding 
depository contracts (Germes-Invest and Menatep are competing to 
be "YeES Rossii" depositories). Moreover, as announced at 
yesterday's press conference, an official dealer has already 
been selected -- the Russian brokerage house, "C. A. and Co." It 
will be involved in maintaining the liquidity of the secondary 
market of RAO "YeES Rossii" stock.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Shipunova: "Lefortovo Passions"] </F>
  [Text] The State Duma amnesty decision has eclipsed all 
other events in the political life of Russia, including the 
president's long-awaited state of the union address to the 
parliament. It is, of course, being mentioned, but more out of 
politeness, while all attention is on the main event--the 
freeing of the October "mutineers." The reaction to this event 
is panic, of the kind seen in the American action movie "The 
Russians Are Coming." Before the Lefortovo prisoners even got 
home our watchful television began to warn the population of the 
threat of civil war every couple of hours on all the channels. 
  In reality the threat is different. Imagine for a moment 
that 
the person who walked out of Lefortovo gate Saturday night is... 
a future president of Russia. This immediately explains the 
panic on television (the cat knows whose meat he has stolen), 
Kostikov's hysterical statements, and some bureaucrats' feverish 
attempts to "put things in reverse gear"--through an immediate 
ban on political activities. 
  Note: The amnesty also covered GKChP [State Committee on the 
State of Emergency] members, but somehow nobody remembers that. 
Which means that it is not because "principle prevailed" (in 
this instance the principle of inevitable punishment)--it is 
about concrete individuals. The elderly "putschists" of 1991, 
their health already undermined, no longer represent a real 
danger. The young, full of vitality and energy, "mutineers" of 
1993 are a completely different matter, and one of them is 
especially dangerous. Had they all been released, while this one 
remained behind bars, there probably would be less clamor and 
fear in presidential and television circles. 
  The "magnificent seven" who have been released represent a 
threat, of course, but not to society, to ordinary people--they 
are a threat to the authorities, to their--nor our--safety. They 
will not rush, as soon as they have a quick cup of tea with the 
family, to rouse people to storm the Kremlin; when the time 
comes they will run in elections. And these elections for some 
are worse than an assault--an assault can be repelled; after the 
elections, whether one likes it or not, it will be time to say 
goodbye to Kremlin accommodations. 
  By the time this amnesty happened--so unexpectedly for 
everyone--a certain equilibrium had established itself in 
Russian political circles, a sort of "calm before the storm." 
The president is well and alive (suffering, perhaps, from a mild 
cold), and all the current political forces, without paying 
particular attention to him, began to quietly, surreptitiously 
prepare for the next presidential elections. Everybody suddenly 
remembered about party organizational development and urgently 
got busy creating new parties and strengthening existing ones. 
Everybody suddenly became concerned about their own image, and 
the press is doing its best to help them. ARGUMENTY I FAKTY, for 
instance, reminds us through the mouth of a Moscow University 
psychologist: "You need to find the right smile, gestures, 
stance, facial expressions...." 
  The political leadership in Russia currently is experiencing 
a crisis stemming from the fact that the old leaders have 
practically outlived their utility while the new ones--their 
replacements--have not yet shown themselves to the full extent. 
By inertia Yeltsin is still recognized as an all-Russia leader, 
but his political useful life is largely exhausted. He has 
already destroyed everything he could, and there is no "work" of 
this sort left for him to do in the country. At this point there 
is no new national leader in Russia. He may not appear in an 
environment where the nation is split, stratified; a man whom 
some love and others hate, and vice versa. We can only talk of 
recognition of some or other leader by a relative majority of 
society. 
  Such leaders come forward, however, not on a wave from the 
grassroots, from the people, but from the top--from parties, 
state and social structures; the base of such advancements are 
often the unrestrained personal ambitions of some or other 
individual, who uses a favorable historic moment for 
self-assertion. Troubled times in Russia have always produced a 
large number of pretenders, and our time is no exception. 
  So far the disposition of forces on the political scene is 
rather simple. On one side of the spectrum are parties and 
movements set up by former members of the president's inner 
circle; on the other--by his political opponents; he himself is 
in the middle, practically alone. None of his former 
confederates is there with him--neither the early Burbulis, nor 
the late Gaydar, nor the eternal Poltoranin; even his pet 
Shumeyko now keeps his distance. Some new people, whose names 
evoke no recognition, currently "advise" and "help" the 
president, interpret his statements, or sometimes speak for him. 
All those who were earlier in the orbit of the powerful figure 
of B.N. Yeltsin have now gained political independence as 
parliament members, leaders of parties and blocs, and heads of 
centers and foundations, and do not want to leave the political 
scene with him, and are therefore increasingly distancing 
themselves from him. Closer to the elections they will make him, 
pardon me, a "scapegoat" and sacrifice him many times over in 
the election battle for the president's job. 
  All the leaders of the democratic wing are strong insofar 
they have access to administrative levers and can actively use 
them to achieve personal political goals--as, for instance, 
Gaydar did in organizing the Russia's Choice bloc or Shakhray in 
setting up his PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord]. Had 
they not been deputy prime ministers in the government at the 
time, it is unlikely they would have managed to accomplish this 
as fast and easily. 
  Still, the democratic movement has been unable to produce a 
political figure of Yeltsin's dimensions, and now it is unlikely 
that it will. Betting on Gaydar is a loss. Not only is his 
appearance a negative factor; most importantly, his idea has 
already discredited itself in the eyes of society, as well as 
his orientation toward the West. 
  The leadership situation is different on the other end of 
the 
political spectrum. Several charismatic figures have appeared 
here lately, with a great range of abilities both in terms of 
theoretical activities (Zyuganov, Baburin) and organizational 
work among the popular masses (Anpilov, Konstantinov, Terekhov). 
Zhirinovskiy holds a place of his own--undoubtedly a born 
political leader, but a loner. Leaders of this wing have no 
levers, no opportunity to use state channels and mass media to 
organize their supporters; on the contrary, for quite a while 
now all of them have been operating in a mode of bitter 
confrontation with the authorities. Nevertheless, behind these 
leaders today are far greater groups of the population, ordinary 
people, including in the regions, than behind the dwarf capital 
city parties of democrats. The explanation is the popular, 
patriotic idea that is close and understandable to people. 
  We have to admit, however, that neither does the patriotic 
opposition have a single leader today; there is no large-scale 
personality sufficiently popular among the people beyond the 
boundaries of one party. Aleksandr Rutskoy probably could become 
such a leader in a new environment. This is what politicians and 
journalists scared by the amnesty have in mind; it is this 
prospect they suspect when they say that a principally new 
political situation is now emerging in Russia. They are afraid 
of this situation. 
  Can Rutskoy, after all that has happened to him, win the 
presidential elections? If we take as an indicator the 
experience of the recent past--yes, he can. The precedent was 
set by none other than Yeltsin himself in 1991. Compare: Like 
Boris Nikolayevich, Rutskoy was a member of the top national 
leadership when he started an open confrontation with it; just 
as Yeltsin in his time began a fight against party privileges, 
Rutskoy practically alone took a stand against corruption; just 
like Boris Nikolayevich, he sacrificed his career as a result 
and was subjected to persecution and massive discreditation by 
the press, which earned him--again, like it did for Yeltsin in 
1990-1991--popularity among the people. As you can see, it all 
falls into place. But Rutskoy also has perceptible advantages: 
He is younger, stronger, and behind him is not a party 
nomenklatura past but the truly tragic biography of a warrior. 
Being held prisoner in Afghanistan and Lefortovo is not the same 
as falling off the bridge. 
  Rutskoy's image among the voters is that of a hero, a 
fighter, a person who has suffered for the people--precisely 
what is capable today of eliciting empathy and trust. 
  I do not idealize him--if for no other reason than because 
no 
politician is worth idealizing. Rutskoy has his weaknesses and 
vulnerabilities. Of course, he is not all that knowledgeable in 
economics and management, but neither is Yeltsin, as it turned 
out, knowledgeable about these things at all. He is too 
hotheaded, hot-tempered, too straightforward and gullible--in 
short, he is too unsophisticated for such a job state job. But 
life teaches us a lot of things, and the months spent in prison 
should have taught their lessons. Both he and the other 
Lefortovo prisoners had enough time to think everything through, 
gain an insight into everything--in a way to look into the 
mirror of life and politics, see both oneself and others in it, 
and understand where they were right and where they were wrong, 
and how they appeared in the eyes of their supporters and 
opponents, in the eyes of the people. People are not born 
political leaders--they become such in the process of struggle. 
Sometimes defeat is more useful for personal development than 
victory, and prison is of course not the best but, who knows, 
perhaps not the worst place for an individual to mature 
politically. 
  The future that emerges with Rutskoy's return to politics 
can 
easily be figured out, which, of course, is exactly what has 
already been done. Therefore we should expect in the near future 
the most undemocratic--to the point of human rights 
violations--actions on the part of the executive branch aimed at 
neutralizing Rutskoy, eliminating him from the "game." It is not 
accidental that a likely prospective general procurator is one 
of the people who just recently followed Rutskoy's "Swiss 
trail..." 
  So, what has really changed in Russia with the announcement 
of the political amnesty? The state Duma for the first time made 
a claim to being a serious entity, which undoubtedly strengthens 
its authority as a body of representative power. The opposition 
got powerful reinforcement and possibly will gain a strong 
leader. The president's positions have become even more shaky, 
while his attempts to punish "the guilty" will only finally 
undermine his authority in society. Democrats are being pushed 
into the background; their chances for success in the upcoming 
presidential elections are declining sharply. 
  As to the "civil war"--"civil accord" dichotomy, there 
probably will be neither. The opposition has learned from bitter 
experience and will not allow new clashes, while reconciliation 
with the regime in this situation is impossible. Which leaves 
only one way open--to work through the parliament and prepare 
for new elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Surkov, head of a presidential </F>
commission to examine deputy privileges and social guarantees, 
by unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent; place and date 
not given: "Excluded From the Feeding-Trough"] 
  [Text] After B. Yeltsin dissolved the deputy corps of 
Russia on 21 September, parliament's death-agony did not 
continue for very long--two weeks. 
  At the same time, some of the deputies voluntarily gave up 
their deputy positions, while others are holding on to their 
badges to this day. As is the custom in our country, after any 
kind of turmoil there is a lengthy analysis of "who helped carry 
the wood" for the president, and who, for Khasbulatov. This 
time, thank God, it is not in order to execute by firing squad, 
but only simply to deny deputy privileges and social guarantees. 
Aleksey Surkov, an ex-deputy, was entrusted to head the 
commission established for this purpose under the president's 
administration. 
  Edict No. 1435 of 23 September guaranteed all deputies a 
continuation of housing, job placement, an early pension, a 
large severance pay, and medical and health resort support. But 
part of the deputies ignored this edict, as well as Edict No. 
1400, out of political considerations. Many from that 
irreconcilable opposition were the first to run to the cash 
department directly from the burning White House. This was N. 
Malkov, I. Muravyev, N. Ogorodnikov, T. Ponamareva, I. Rybkin, 
A. Sokolov, and others. It will be recalled--they received 
approximately 2 million rubles [R] each. 
  Such hypocrisy on the part of people who incited a bloody 
tragedy, which almost became the starting point of a civil war, 
did not go unnoticed. By Edict No. 1590 of 6 October, social 
guarantees for the former people's deputies who remained in the 
White House to the end were canceled. 
  Of course, we had to look into the rather delicate question. 
We are not the investigators, and we generally wanted to find 
out through questionnaires until what date a deputy was in the 
White House, whether he took part in mass disorders, and whether 
he instigated them. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Did the president make short work of 
political opponents through your commission? 
  [Surkov] No, that is not the way people are dealt with. 
Today, many deputies are very surprised, seeing many 
"troublemakers" in "high" positions. According to Edict No. 
1590, it was necessary to leave the White House before 3 
October. But for several days before this, the very same people 
were approving decrees of congress right up to the execution of 
those who supported the president. 
  We examined 530 personalities, carefully studied verbatim 
reports, and we also had a Ministry of Internal Affairs list of 
those who were led out of the White House on 4 October. 
  As a result, 151 former people's deputies of the Russian 
Federation were identified to whom Edict No. 1435 does not 
apply. In accordance with complaints and statements, 13 former 
deputies on this list were authorized to receive severance pay.

Yasenkov. (The names of deputies who were newly elected to 
the State Duma and the Federation Council are published in 
boldface.) 
  Thus, I think that everyone should know this list of 
antiheroes who, hiding behind walls, wanted to involve the whole 
population of the country in a bloody slaughter. 
  I want to note that those who are on the list, but who have 
already received money, will be obliged to return it. This, in 
my opinion, is one of the reasons that many of them began to 
shout about reconciliation and general political amnesty. The 
trial of Khasbulatov and Rutskoy is disadvantageous to them. The 
chain will also stretch to the State Duma to those who urged the 
leaders on to a bloody confrontation. The very same method is 
being used to frustrate the criminal cases--through a deputy 
commission. 
  FROM THE EDITORIAL STAFF. In publishing the 
"blacklist," we are refraining from making our own comments. 
Some will assess it as a political sentence for the extremists, 
and some will perceive them to be heroes. But everyone must make 
this choice for himself.

<F P=106> [Interview with N. Medvedev, member of the personnel </F>
certification commission, by Andrey Uglanov; place and date not 
given: "On the Invisible Front; the Eyes and Ears Will Remain"] 
  [Text] "Fighters of the invisible front," "knights of 
the cloak and dagger"--these romantic labels have stopped 
accompanying employees of the KGB, and later, of the Ministry of 
Security. At first, they were deprived of the halo of the 
infallible, and afterwards a quiet attempt was made to get rid 
of them. The latest attempt at such a radical riddance was the 
reorganization of the Ministry of Security into the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service (FCS), with fundamental changes in 
functions. The personnel certification commission also appeared. 
Our interlocutor is N. Medvedev, a member of the commission. 
  [Uglanov] Nikolay Pavlovich, has the president decided to 
completely get rid of the very mention of the KGB and the 
Ministry of Security? 
  [Medvedev] In accordance with his edict, the functions of 
the 
GB [Security Service] are being changed. Now, these are 
counterintelligence organs. With the change in functions, there 
is also a change in the qualitative composition of personnel. 
Certification of the personal qualifications of personnel, of 
course, is going on, with their political views being taken into 
account. And it is clear: These organs should serve the state. 
  [Uglanov] But whom did they serve? 
  [Medvedev] Also the state. But how? Ideological and 
political 
functions that were not natural for a normal state were being 
performed. And after the reformation of the KGB all that 
occurred was a change in the signboard. All of the traditional 
approaches of serving the state remained. 
  [Uglanov] Well, for example? 
  [Medvedev] In Penza Oblast, security organs publicly 
arrested 
the head of administration of the oblast before the elections 
(he was appointed by the president). The Procuracy and the court 
investigated this incident, and the case was closed--"There was 
no reason to find fault with the head of administration." But 
the Ministry of Security and the heads of administration are 
associated with one and the same structure--the authority of the 
president. And this is what the question was--how to serve the 
state. 
  [Uglanov] Does the commission have access to lists of the 
agents of the Ministry of Security among the deputies, 
journalists, politicians, and others? 
  [Medvedev] There is a person on the commission's staff who 
can have such access. 
  [Uglanov] But do you not feel sorry for generals who served 
faithfully and truthfully? 
  [Medvedev] A majority of those who are presented to the 
commission will be certified. We are reviewing those who were 
removed by the managers of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service--N. Golushko and S. Stepashin. But I, for example, have 
doubts about the Penza leadership and the heads of this 
department in St. Petersburg and in Leningrad Oblast. This is 
associated first and foremost with questions of a political 
nature. 
  [Uglanov] Thus, will the reduction of the leadership of the 
Ministry of Security be noticeable or not? 
  [Medvedev] It will be. 
  [Uglanov] And will the buildings, for example in the center 
of Moscow, be vacated? 
  [Medvedev] I think that part of them, yes. But they will be 
occupied by the Border Troops Service. 
  [Uglanov] Will secret collaborators of the KGB fall under 
the 
reduction. 
  [Medvedev] With the change in Ministry of Security 
functions, 
I think so. But for purposes of counterintelligence work, 
everything will be done. The eyes and ears will remain. But 
there will be no surveillance for ideological and political 
reasons. 
  There also will be no thoughtless reductions. We will not 
create the kind of situation where an embittered professional 
would pass into the criminal and shady sphere. 
  [Uglanov] It is most likely that the hunt has already 
started 
for generals and their brains. 
  [Medvedev] Yes, and not only for generals. But all of the 
specialists will remain. I do not rule out a situation when we 
will even have to increase the number of workers for new 
functions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Starostin, chairman of the </F>
International Humanitarian Russian Fund, by Aleksandr Shinkin; 
place and date not given: "`Russian' Can Speed Up Housewarmings, 
but Its Program Requires State Guarantees"] 
  [Text] In December of last year, our newspaper wrote about 
the Russian International Humanitarian Fund (see ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA of 23 December 1993 "`Russian' Will Help Its Own"), which 
is engaged in the construction of housing in Russia for refugees 
and forced resettlers from countries of the near abroad. We are 
once again returning to this subject, taking into account the 
numerous phone calls to the editorial office with requests for 
assistance to contact the fund or to give more details about it. 
The fund's capabilities and the problems that it is running into 
are recounted by Ivan Starostin, its chairman. 
  [Shinkin] Ivan Fedorovich, tell me, did you keep your word 
that the first group of refugees will be housed in new 
apartments before the new year? 
  [Starostin] Have no doubts. More than 20 families, members 
of 
our fund, held housewarmings and celebrated New Year at the same 
time. Very soon approximately 200 more families, as they say, 
will have their corner in the motherland. 
  This, of course, is not a lot, but it is also not that 
little, if you consider that, in fact, we have been working just 
a little more than a year. 
  [Shinkin] On what conditions does the fund offer people 
housing? 
  [Starostin] I will note that at a congress we approved 
Russians who by force of circumstances have found themselves 
outside the borders of their historic motherland and who desire 
to return to it. Most of these people are not rich. Therefore, 
the conditions in our country are most acceptable for them. 
First, we sell the housing only at cost. Second, the fist 
payment on the conclusion of the contract amounts to 20 percent 
of the cost of the apartment. The remaining sum is paid over the 
course of 10 years. At a time when other firms, as far as I 
know, are selling housing, as a rule, at commercial prices and 
immediately for full cost. Only a few can manage this. 
  [Shinkin] Do those who are returning to Russia have an 
opportunity to choose where they will resettle? 
  [Starostin] Unquestionably. Of course, for the time being 
the 
housing fund has been established essentially in the European 
part of Russia. But projects are also ready for its eastern 
regions. In addition, our fund not only builds and buys 
apartments in cities, but it is also building whole settlements 
with socio-cultural purpose facilities and production premises. 
Thus, our customers have to take into account only their 
material capabilities in selecting their place of residence. 
While in Moscow's outlying districts a square meter of housing 
costs somewhere around 600,000 rubles [R], then, for example in 
Krasnodar its price is lower by a factor of three. 
  [Shinkin] Several persons from Latvia in telephone 
conversations with me have asked the editorial office about 
assistance for your fund. There is the same kind of request in a 
telegram from Estonia, on which there were more than 100 
signatures. What, Ivan Fedorovich, caused this? 
  [Starostin] The fund's general problems, it must be assumed. 
But the gist of them is this. The Russian Fund is not a 
government organization. And we do not rely on state subsidies, 
recognizing the limitation of the state budget and the profusion 
of unresolved tasks in the country. Therefore, from the first 
days we have counted on nonbudgetary sources of financing. 
  Understandably, a lot cannot be built on the personal means 
of our customers. Credits are needed. If they are taken in 
commercial banks, then this means that it is necessary to raise 
the price of housing by a factor of 2.5-3. It is more 
advantageous, as the calculations of economists show, to take 
credit in the West. As early as the beginning of last year, we 
reached an agreement with the leaders of the concern MK 
Technology Trading and a number of American banks about 
allocating credit under the fund program in the amount of $250 
million. Moreover, under very favorable conditions. In addition, 
the United States Department of State was also ready to offer 
humanitarian credit in the amount of $5 million. 
  One requirement was raised on their part: the guarantees of 
the government of Russia and the inclusion of the fund in the 
implementation of the state program for alternative 
construction. But we were unable to accomplish this in our 
corridors of power. While former Vice President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy did not skimp on promises, Shumeyko, Shakhray, and 
others did not even deign to give us their answer. 
  [Shinkin] But, you will agree, Ivan Fedorovich, it is not a 
rare case when personal interests are decided on the pretext of 
common interests. 
  [Starostin] Doubts are understandable. Only we are prepared 
to account for every cent. What is more, we are ready to assume 
the work of representative of the government, which would 
control how the money is being spent. Not to mention the fact 
that we have already calculated the technology of returning it. 
  But the difficulty is that they do not even want to discuss 
this question with us. Assuming, evidently, that there are 
enough places for everyone in Russia, let them come. But the 
problem is not that simple. As investigations show, about 17 
million Russians want to return to the motherland in the near 
future. Even our country is not in a condition to quickly 
"digest" such a number. It also should not be forgotten that 
there are many former servicemen among the homeless, and also 
officers and warrant officers of subunits that will be withdrawn 
from the countries of the near and far abroad. At the very 
least, it is irresponsible not to take this into account. 
  [Shinkin] Judging by your words, you are not planning to 
yield. Hope, it is well known, is the last to perish. At the 
present time, we are conducting negotiations with the 
Export-Import Bank of the United States on granting us favorable 
credits in the sum of $500 million for 10 years. In addition, a 
payment of 3.5 percent annual interest is envisioned for five 
years. The project has received the preliminary approval in 
congress, the State Department, and the Defense Department of 
the United States. But, again, everything depends on state 
guarantees. 
  Together with the Interdepartmental Commission on Social 
Problems of Servicemen and Members of Their Families, our fund 
submitted a request on 18 January to First Vice President Oleg 
Soskovets for an examination of this question. We are prepared 
to submit all of the necessary documents and detailed accounts. 
Indeed, apparently, the appeal to the editorial office of 
members of the fund is a result of this. They want to bring the 
attention of the public to their needs. After all, I will 
repeat, credits for us are an opportunity to accelerate housing 
construction. But this means to support and inspire confidence 
in 300,000 persons who are forced to abandon the places they 
lived in. Three hundred thousand--this is the figure of the 
number of members of our fund today. They deserve the attention 
of the Government of Russia. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  The editorial office will report in subsequent issues about 
what kinds of results were obtained by the appeal of the leaders 
of the Russian Fund and the Interdepartmental Commission on 
Social Problems of Servicemen and Members of Their Families to 
First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets.

<H3>  From a Speech by Nikolay Pankov, Chairman of the Executive 
Committee of the Rodina Association </H3>
  "Assistance to refugees and those forced to resettle 
requires 
a comprehensive approach. But, in our opinion, it is necessary 
for the Russian side in cooperation with Russian communities and 
Russian social organizations to adopt a number of immediate 
measures. First, there is a need for a precise schedule of 
activities of state and local organs of authority and the broad 
public on the reception of the resettlers. Second, a program is 
necessary for the resettlers that would provide for annual 
quotas, determine specific oblasts and krays, and allocate 
finances for the creation of an appropriate infrastructure. To 
compile such a program requires a realistic forecast of the 
expected number of resettlers. Only the Russian communities are 
able to do this. And, third, Russia should insist on signing 
special agreements with states of the near abroad, whose policy 
is the reason for the departure of Russians, according to which 
these states would assume a specific part of the expenditures 
for resettlement, which would create normal conditions for the 
departure of Russians--sale of apartments, issuance of 
transport, containers, and so on." [End boxed item]

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Todres: "Local Elections"] </F>
  [Text] The "red revenge," which according to general 
opinion will crown the upcoming local elections is, first of 
all, inevitable and, secondly, not deadly. 
  The crux of the matter is in that difference which 
commentators for some reason prefer to omit in their 
presentations: In most cases, the "revanchists" will not be 
representing either the party of Zyuganov, or the party of 
Zhirinovskiy, no matter how one extrapolates the December 
breakdown of sympathies of the population onto the future 
voting. Nevertheless, if we recall the past, the December 
figures are sooner reflected in the regional elections not by 
the votes for one or another party list, but by the results of 
the race for seats in the Federation Council. This race, as we 
know, was triumphantly won by the local leadership. 
  The current pre-electoral landscape is unusually monotypic 
throughout all of Russia: The "party of the communists" and the 
"party of the democrats" are trying either to agree or to oppose 
the "party of the administration." The henchmen of the 
former--either leaders or businessmen surrounding the 
leaders--are not difficult to recognize even in that amorphous 
bunch of candidates which is today gathering signatures for 
registration. (We might add that rarely are there less than 
about 20 aspirants for one mandate. Usually there are more). We 
need not explain that they have all the advantages in gathering 
signatures as well as in the pre-electoral propaganda. Moreover, 
as the recent letter from "DemRossiya" to Boris Yeltsin states, 
"at each new election, there are more and more falsifications." 
  Specific party structures, hastily outfitted for the past 
all-people's expression of will, will not help either the LDPR 
[Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] or "DemRossiya." As for the 
former, according to the astute expression of the ex-head of the 
Krasnoyarsk Kray Soviet, Vyacheslav Novikov, "everyone who is 
relatively healthy has already been elected to the State Duma." 
And as for the units of the latter, as the "Demoross" activists 
themselves admit, "the farther we go, the less we are capable 
of." The PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] may expect a 
certain success for one reason: Where this party exists, it is 
firmly rooted in the "party of the administration." "Choice of 
Russia" cannot expect such a fate in most cases. From the moment 
of Yegor Gaydar's dismissal from the office of vice prime 
minister, the loyal sentiments of the governors do not extend to 
him. 
  The winners in the local elections will be those who have 
been fated to be victorious in them. In the Fall, Boris Yeltsin 
increased their chances even more by farming out the 
organization of the local elections to the provincial 
administrators. It is interesting how, in his opinion, they 
intend to exercise these rights. 
  However, the most important thing in this entire matter is 
the fact that the described "revenge of the party active 
membership" will not radically change anything in the current 
situation. The local dumas in their present variant will become 
amusing appendages of the administration not only because of 
their personnel make-up, but simply because of their 
construction. Moreover, their powers and authorities are rather 
notably truncated. Not in one of the new parliaments will there 
be more than two-fifths of the deputy corps working on a 
permanent basis. That is only about 10 people. 
  We may expect that the goals of the dumas are already clear, 
and the tasks have been defined. Their decisions will give 
"representative weight" to the intentions and actions of the 
administration. The parties will not be able to influence even 
one of the parliaments, but the clans will dictate their will to 
all--just as the clans of agrarians, defense men or, say, raw 
materials exporters today dictate their will to the 
administrations. As for the effectiveness of their pressure on 
the government--it is defined not by the make-up of the 
re-elected Soviets, but by the readiness of the government to 
submit to this pressure. 
  This constitutes the most important and inevitable result of 
the new elections. The nomenclature past of the new deputies, 
perhaps, hinders them in the eyes of the politicized public. 
However, it is not the former ideological (or career) 
obligations which define the consciousness, but only the present 
day subsidy-oriented (or, on the contrary, export-profit) 
existence. By the way, those who are generally considered to be 
reformers also were not members of the White Guard in their 
lives before perestroyka. 
  The above-described "red revenge" merely reproduces the 
current state of affairs in the country. If we assume that 
everything is not yet lost for reform in Russia, then this 
revenge is not deadly. If we believe that everything is 
over--then everything was over even before the local elections. 
If the efforts of the Kremlin to re-schedule the elections are 
evoked by a desire to avoid these results, they are in vain. One 
way or the other, no matter how long they are postponed, the die 
comes up a winner for the "revanchists," because this die has 
only one side.

<F P=106> [Information agency reports from Kuybyshev, Yekaterinburg, </F>
Samara, and Krasnodar: "Elections Postponed in Kuybyshev, 
Sverdlovsk, and Chelyabinsk Oblasts and Krasnodar Kray. Why?"] 
  [Text]Information concerning this was transmitted by 
information agencies. One reason was indicated: A complicated 
socioeconomic situation in the regions. We asked our 
correspondents to report to the readers whether this were really 
the case. This is what they report. 
<H5>  Yekaterinburg </H5>
  Report by Vladimir Stakheyev: "The Reasons for the Delay Are 
Purely Technical" 
  "The postponement of the date of the elections to the oblast 
duma and local self-government organs of the Urals is by no 
means explained by the socioeconomic situation," our 
correspondent was told by Natalya Ponomareva, the press 
secretary of the head of administration of Sverdlovsk Oblast. 
  As is known, E. Rossel, the former head of administration, 
was dismissed from the position by an edict of the president of 
Russia of 9 November 1993. The very same edict temporarily 
entrusted his duties to V. Trushnikov, the chairman of the 
oblast government. 
  It is natural that out of ethical and other quite 
understandable reasons, the acting head of administration did 
not begin to sign such an important document as a statute 
(albeit a provisional one) concerning the oblast duma and organs 
of self-government, and also concerning elections to these 
organs of authority. 
  With the appointment of A. Strakhov as head of 
administration, the documents were signed and already published 
in January. Elections in the Middle Urals, according to the 
provisional statute, will be held within 72 days after the 
publication of these documents; that is, on 10 April 1994. So 
the postponement of the date of the elections in the kray to a 
later date is not associated with any other reasons. 
<H5>  Samara </H5>
  Report by V. Mikhaylov: "Ready for Elections on the Volga" 
  Did the administration of Samara Oblast appeal to the 
president of the Russian Federation for a delay in the time of 
conducting elections to local representative organs of 
authority? I asked this question of many officials of the oblast 
administration, and all of them, as if they had come to an 
agreement, answered "No." 
  After breaking through a consultative palisade, I got into 
contact with Vladimir Mokryy, the deputy head of the oblast 
administration and manager of the staff. 
  "It never even crossed our minds," he said. "Really, in the 
oblast, as on the whole in the country, the socioeconomic 
situation is rather complicated. Plants are working on a short 
week, many plants have not issued pay for a month and more, 
prices are increasing.... But, in our opinion, this is not the 
reason for the postponement of the elections to the oblast duma 
and to city and rayon representative organs. Work in this 
direction is moving at the prescribed pace: Electoral districts 
have been formed, and candidates for deputy are being nominated. 
The elections will be held at the end of March. We are confident 
that there will be no interruptions." 
  "Is it possible that the leadership of the city of Samara 
would like to delay the elections?" 
  "No," I was assured by Aleksandr Simonov, business manager 
of 
the city administration. "We will hold the elections on the 
scheduled dates. We have no objective reasons for doubting this. 
Samara Oblast is ready for elections to local organs." 
<H5>  Krasnodar </H5>
  Report by Aleksandr Bulygin, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
correspondent: 
"Common Sense Is Dictating" 
  Sergey Danilenko, deputy chairman of the electoral 
commission 
of Krasnodar Kray, explained that, guided specifically by this 
principle, the Kuban authorities decided to postpone the dates 
of the simultaneous elections of deputies to kray, rayon, and 
city dumas to 12 June. Rejecting suspicions of some kind of 
intent, Sergey Andreyevich does not decline answers to tricky 
questions: 
  "How ready you journalists are with assessments. But the 
central electoral commission responded to our letter that `it 
does not detect legal obstacles for the conduct of simultaneous 
elections to the kray legislative assembly and local 
self-government organs in May-June of this year.' And President 
of Russia Boris Yeltsin has looked into the situation developing 
in the regions, and has advised not `to capture' the electoral 
commissions in the localities with tough provisional limits. The 
kray administration has no aspiration to gain time, or to 
receive any kind of additional advantages. There is only a 
desire to cut expenditures at a minimum to 6 billion rubles [R]. 
That is what the cost of the elections would be just to the kray 
duma, and even more for the city and rayon elections. It would 
not be difficult to predict the opinion of the taxpayers 
concerning such generosity." 
  "But, after all, the administration has scheduled elections 
for 3 April?..." 
  "Yes, such a decision was made when there was no clarity 
concerning the elections of deputies to local self-government 
organs. But what would happen if we did not make corrections? 
Posters of candidates and party blocs who ran for election to 
the Federation Council and the State Duma have not been washed 
off everywhere yet, and it would already be necessary to start 
in the kray, followed by the city and rayon parliaments. Will 
there be many who will want to vote within two or three months? 
And also, work in gardens and kitchen gardens will be in full 
swing. By June, incidentally, the period of strenuous effort of 
the dacha crowd will subside, and the season of mass leaves will 
not be under way yet." 
  "What do you expect from the next preelection marathon?" 
  "I do not think it will be easy. Rather the opposite, and it 
will be complicated not only by extraneous campaign features, 
but also by an increase in the number of aspirants for one seat. 
We must take into account the statute on elections and other 
documents. The city and rayon electoral commissions have plenty 
of troubles. They also heaved a sigh of relief when they learned 
about the postponed voting dates. After all, the kray center 
alone will have to break more than half of the precincts into 
smaller units, to find and ready premises, to collate and revise 
voter lists, and to bring all documentation into conformity with 
the new statute on elections. In a word, we are up to our ears 
in work."

<F P=106> [Interview with Mintimer Shaymiyev, president of Tatarstan, </F>
conducted by Kira Vladina in Kazan, in January: "`We Will Sign a 
Treaty With Russia Before March.' This Is What the President of 
Tatarstan Promised in an Interview With NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Back 
in January"] 
  [Text] Kazan, January--My meeting with Mintimer Shaymiyev, 
president of Tatarstan, was scheduled to take place at the 
Borovoye-Matyushino recreation center, at a guest dacha near 
Kazan. 
  The leadership settlement is not that big--40 frame houses, 
not particularly aesthetic in appearance. The whole charm of the 
settlement is the forest and the age-old firs, the tops of which 
glisten with the white of frost and gleams of the sun. They are 
almost all two-family houses. The chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
is the neighbor of the mayor of Kazan. The atmosphere in the 
dachas is, I would say, simple. 
  The guest house stands out in the settlement somewhat both 
by 
its external appearance and its interior. It was built by 
craftsmen from General Service Department. And the cottage had 
been furnished with imported furnishings, only the radio being 
of national production. Neither imported furniture nor foreign 
equipment catches the eye in the homes of the leadership. This 
detail of the life of the president's entourage and the 
president himself has probably performed a considerable role in 
the way in which relations between the first person of the state 
and his people have taken shape. There is not that glaring, 
striking difference in the living standard here: The apartment 
of the working professional, the lecturer at the higher 
educational institution, and the farmer of average means might 
be furnished in this way. 
  [Vladina] I never cease to be amazed at the modesty of the 
furnishing of your home, in your office, and, now, at the dacha. 
What is this--a character trait of yours, or economics, or a 
specially cultivated style? 
  [Shaymiyev] It is a rule of life. 
  [Vladina] I remember the voice of the people: The old 
authorities had everything and thought about the people. The new 
ones--poor democrats--until they are through stealing, will not 
remember the people. 
  [Shaymiyev] I would like to sincerely confess that I 
sometimes feel awkward at being better dressed when I meet 
people because, seeing today's low living standard, I do not 
consider that I have the right to wish for something further, 
over and above what is necessary. This could serve as an 
irritant. 
  [Vladina] Yes, but the republic has, all the same, just one 
president.... 
  [Shaymiyev] I understand, but, still. This depends on 
character, perhaps. But I cannot do otherwise. 
  [Vladina] I was at your national theater, attending the 
premier of the youth show. It is a lively, sparkling 
performance, and the theater has survived since it is in receipt 
of a sizable government subsidy. Does this apply to the whole 
sphere of culture and research? How are you finding the means 
for this? 
  [Shaymiyev] Three years ago our artistic unions, theaters, 
and cultural institutions were in a dreadfully calamitous state. 
That is what power is for--to help gifted people not only 
survive but create. After all, their gifts are God-given, can I 
compare myself with them?... In order to help them, we set up 
the Culture Support Fund. These are not just words; the fund 
operates. Each month the artistic unions meet and determine 
which writer, artist, or actor specifically needs assistance. We 
have given all theaters a subsidy, the actors have begun to 
travel more, and we support overseas travel. 
  The artistic intelligentsia has gained a second wind, as it 
were.... We also now stage various contests, children's 
festivals, say. A song contest for the President's Prize was 
held recently. Small amounts, perhaps, but we allocate money for 
this. 
  Last year we conducted a song festival-contest among adults. 
A $1,000 first prize was established. There are $1,000 also for 
the winners of the annual Chaliapin Festival, and contestants 
from overseas also take part. Practically all children from the 
kindergartens and schools take part in the children's festivals. 
  Of course, there are expenses, big expenses, there is no 
denying that! But we believe that this is a matter of state 
importance and we do not begrudge the money, therefore. You 
yourself know how the people perceive this.... Nothing happens 
or emerges just like that, of its own accord--specially people's 
normal relationship with the state authorities. 
  (I recalled how the president had responded to the heckling 
comments of people in the lower stands of the stadium at the 
time of the opening of the winter season--racing was starting. 
Everyone was in the grip of a common passion, having completely 
forgotten about ranks and titles. It was 20 below, and the 
stands were uncovered, and for this reason the president and his 
entourage stopped to warm themselves at small, 
unattractive-looking service areas. I was struck by an 
interesting detail here: Someone had closed the door to an 
adjoining room, where, most likely, people of a somewhat lower 
level were congregated. The president reacted instantly, and his 
eyes revealed a flash of dissatisfaction. "Open the door. We are 
all together." I saw the "iron" Mintimer [this is what his name 
sounds like in translation]) 
  You have to work the whole time. This is strenuous work. 
Illusions pass. Everything is difficult, and I do not believe 
that it will get any easier in the future. Nonetheless, whenever 
I am in Moscow, I try to conclude each visit with a trip to the 
theater. The last time I went to see Rostand, Raykin's, and saw 
"Cyrano de Bergerac".... 
  (And I suddenly hear the president performing: 
  "Ah, me! I have long been capable of standing frozen in 
admiration 
  "At the sight of grass or a gentle flower...") 
  [Vladina] I was pleasantly gratified by the small number of 
commercial stalls in Kazan. The crime-breeding situation in the 
city is not, therefore, that dramatic, perhaps? 
  [Shaymiyev] I would not judge the progress of market reform 
by the stalls. I do not believe that this is an indicator, 
because the formation of stock companies here is somewhat ahead 
of schedule now. We were for a long time criticized for not 
getting involved in this, but we needed to prepare thoroughly 
for this step. Large enterprises are now engaged in the 
formation of stock companies here, and progress is evident. 
  [Vladina] Are you moving into first place among the CIS 
states? 
  [Shaymiyev] Well, first or not first.... But what have we 
done? We have distributed the R10,000 vouchers to all our 
inhabitants. We added up--we had more property, and we opened 
supplementary accounts in savings banks for each inhabitant of 
the republic, children included. And such an account is called 
the registered privatization voucher--R30,000 in each of them. 
Auctions have now been held. And stock has been issued, and 
investment funds have appeared. 
  [Vladina] And what about privatization of housing here? Has 
it begun? 
  [Shaymiyev] No, we have not embarked on it yet. This is a 
very painful problem for us. We have studied the experience of 
Moscow and St. Petersburg. Many mistakes were made in Moscow, 
after all, and we sought our own approach. We are also investing 
with property people who have been on the waiting list for 
housing for a long time and who did not have such and the very 
neediest in order that these people retain at least some 
advantage: We are opening for them accounts supplementary to the 
R30,000 deposits.... And privatization of housing has worked. 
Everything has now been thought through, it would seem, and the 
value of the property to be privatized and the cost of garbage 
removal, operation of the elevator, and so on, and so forth have 
been determined. There have been mistakes in this plan also, 
perhaps; otherwise, whence the racketeering in housing--this is 
an appalling business.... In order to rid ourselves of this, we 
also have thought up some things: We have introduced a special 
drafting mechanism, which will help people to some extent. When 
it is a question specifically of the interests of an individual, 
everything needs to be given serious thought. For we are 
breaking with established principles for the first time, people 
have never been involved in this before, and it is, therefore, 
hard to foresee the various consequences. And all the criminal 
world does is keep a watch on where weak spots may emerge in 
order to take advantage of them at a rush. 
  [Vladina] Culture, housing.... It is perfectly obvious that 
you are ahead of others here. And land? Is land reform under way 
here? 
  [Shaymiyev] How many years can this game be played? Remember 
how the center spoke about private property at first: We will 
have done with the kolkhozes and sovkhozes, then we will give 
out the land. Then, prior to the elections, an edict appeared. 
Now, after the elections, Boris Nikolayevich makes changes to 
this edict: This and that was not done right, apparently, let us 
adjust it.... In a word, there is once again confirmation of the 
proposition that you should be in no hurry to jump up and 
salute, for all this is attended by additional difficulties for 
the people. Everything needs to be thought through first! There 
is the story of the shepherd who was grazing his sheep and who 
decided to have some fun: He shouted and begged for help--wolves 
were attacking the herd.... He fooled them! And everyone ran to 
help as fast as possible. Since the shepherd had done this once, 
twice, a third time, when the wolves really attacked, no one 
heeded his calls for help.... There has, therefore, to be belief! 
  [Vladina] Mintimir Sharipovich, concerning belief.... Do you 
attend the mosque? 
  [Shaymiyev] The mosque? I am an atheist. 
  [Vladina] But you were born to a religious family? 
  [Shaymiyev] My mother's influence. My father was not a 
believer. I did last year, as president, attend the Central 
Mosque. It was the big festival of Kurban Bayram. And I have now 
just been to the Orthodox Cathedral of Peter and Paul on 
Christmas Eve, 6 January.... 
  [Vladina] And today is our, Christian, 
holiday--Epiphany--and 
I would like to ask you: What do you do not out of official duty 
but at the command of the heart? 
  [Shaymiyev] Duty of the heart.... Attitude toward the 
mosque... yes? In any event, the mosque and Islam appeal only to 
the good. I joyfully accept the serious revival of religion, 
therefore. When I first attended the Peter and Paul Cathedral, I 
inspected the very rich iconostasis, one of the best, and 
understood what a cultural asset this is. 
  [Vladina] Like all people, you surely have moods of 
depression. Is a president entitled to this, and how do you 
restore the balance of the soul? 
  [Shaymiyev] I prefer solitude at such times. 
  [Vladina] Do you not miss the past? 
  [Shaymiyev] I would like to emphasize once again that 
although I did not suffer from the former system, did not suffer 
as a person--I grew in stature continually--I was the 
nomenklatura of that system, as they say: There is no escaping 
the life that has been lived. But we can no longer live as we 
did. I perceived perestroyka with satisfaction, and there are no 
problems here because I, as an industrial manager, now also do 
the same thing, I organize people for work. 
  I very much like the economist Leontieff's formula: The 
economy is a ship or sailboat, which has to have a rudder and a 
sail. And to be able to move by the set course, it needs wind. 
Interest, the driving force of an economy, is the wind. The 
interest of each individual--this is ultimately the incentive to 
the most efficient labor. The sphere of application of the human 
intellect or hands, be it private property or other forms of the 
use of this interest, is not that important, therefore. The main 
thing is that there be interest in labor. We must make use of 
this factor. The old social system did not, alas, afford us 
access to any form of activity. We attempted to operate via 
ideology, compulsion, and socialist competition, but were unable 
to properly awaken interest in what was being done. And it was 
unclear to me how this was to be achieved other than by a change 
of the form of ownership. The fact that we are changing the form 
of ownership--I am not in any doubt about this. The ways of 
achieving the goal leave much to be desired, of course. Property 
should in time, therefore, pass into normal hands; there is no 
escaping this process. I cannot imagine our future otherwise. 
But I cannot say of which system--capitalism or socialism--I am 
a devotee: There is simply no such thing as capitalism in the 
form in which we were taught. 
  [Vladina] Your attitude toward Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Shaymiyev] I do not trust Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Vladina] People put their trust.... 
  [Shaymiyev] No, they did not. This was a protest against 
what 
is happening in society. I personally cannot take this election 
seriously, perhaps this is my mistake. The democrats have begun 
to accuse one another of having failed to unite for no good 
reason, otherwise they would have won. This is rubbish! Had they 
not separated into blocs and operated under the slogan of 
Russia's Choice, they would have lost even more heavily. Today 
Yavlinskiy and Shakhray have won some number of votes also. But 
what is there in the program of Russia's Choice to attract the 
people? Why should people have voted for this bloc, for the 
mistakes they made? No one should be accused of anything, 
therefore; it is conclusions that need to be drawn: A course 
correction is needed. This was the fundamental mistake--counting 
on foreign assistance. It is time to produce everything 
ourselves. 
  [Vladina] Today, when the Constitution of Russia has been 
approved and your republic has a special position, are you 
personally not experiencing psychological strain on account of 
the opposition to the powerful will of the center? Are you up to 
this? 
  [Shaymiyev] We walked out of the Constitutional Conference 
because Tatarstan's voice was not being heard. We were, after 
all, already living by the Constitution--by the old Constitution 
of the Russian Federation, it is true. The very concept of 
sovereignty is absent from the new Constitution. It is 
altogether incomprehensible how it is possible to forget about 
the Federal Treaty, which both the present president and the 
former Supreme Soviet presented to the people as a tremendous 
achievement for the sake of preservation of the Russian 
Federation. Today the Federation Treaty has been forgotten, as 
it were, and it would, most likely, be best were no one to 
remember it. Is this right?... Almost half the republics of the 
Russian Federation rejected the Constitution since it is 
incapable of securing the complete accord of our society, even 
taking account of the fact that it was adopted in accordance 
with low requirements. It turns out that one-third of the 
populace voted for the adoption of the Constitution, but the 
majority has to live in accordance with it. But I still hope 
that there will be no further violation of the Constitution of 
the Russian Federation. Neither by the president nor by anyone 
else. And now, continuing the process of negotiations with the 
Russian Federation, we must within the frameworks of the 
Constitutions of Russia and Tatarstan come to an accord. Is this 
more difficult today than yesterday? Undoubtedly. But can 
agreement be reached? I believe so. 
  [Vladina] From where do you derive your strength in 
defending 
your case that this is an understanding of the true interests of 
both the people of Tatarstan and of Russia as a federation? 
  [Shaymiyev] You know, this could be defined as inner 
opposition, but I do not wish to call it this, although this, 
perhaps, is what many people think. But, from my viewpoint, it 
is the position that could help build a more democratic federal 
Russian state. Unfortunately, we are not taking advantage of 
this propitious moment in history and have once again taken the 
path of easy solutions, because building an empire and a unitary 
state on a smaller scale in the place of the former Union seemed 
far simpler than building a democratic federation. It is 
necessary for this, after all, to negotiate with us and with the 
other states; it is necessary to have sufficient patience and to 
reach an accord in order that society be rid of the constant 
tension. 
  But there is another aspect of the matter also. I am now 
told: We have a Constitution, it has been adopted, your voice 
was not heard. What next? I say: We need to come to some 
arrangement, everything needs to be resolved in civilized 
fashion. If some people are dreaming of other forms of 
cooperation and power pressure, we have already had this. Why 
resort to such a solution of questions? When there is a lack of 
other arguments and the patience to negotiate. Of course, any 
people within the former Union and Russia could today still be 
"driven" into any regime; people lived for so many decades "in a 
regime," after all, but then there should be an end to the talk 
about democracy. 
  [Vladina] Have we gone back to what we had before? 
  [Shaymiyev] To worse than what we had before, even. It is 
for 
this reason that the soundness of my position and my conviction 
give me strength. The position of Tatarstan is that of the 
building of a law-based democratic Russian Federation. We shall 
not abandon our positions, although we will, via, perhaps, 
compromise even, arrive at a treaty with the Russian Federation. 
We will sign it. There will come a time when our case is 
recognized. I have a composed attitude toward this. 
  [Vladina] You have an upcoming meeting with Yeltsin. What do 
you expect of it, what might the compromise be? 
  [Shaymiyev] The president and I have a normal relationship, 
but our positions do not always coincide. We have agreed to 
continue the negotiations and reach mutual accord. Unless my 
intuition deceives me, I believe that we will have signed the 
treaty before March. But on condition that no one seek seeming 
advantages for himself, neither party. Repeat elections are 
scheduled here for 13 March. After all, Russia also has an 
interest in Tatarstan being represented in both the Duma and the 
Federation Council. If Tatarstan is not represented, as today, 
in either the Duma or the Federation Council, the 
constitutional, legal question--where is Tatarstan--will arise. 
In order that the elections be held on 13 March, therefore, the 
treaty should have been signed and relations with the Russian 
Federation regulated by that time. Then we also will tell our 
people: We have come to an agreement, the provisions of the 
relationship have been formulated, and we will take part in the 
activity of the Duma and the Federation Council--in a word, in 
the affairs of Russia. 
  [Vladina] Nine months have elapsed since our last meeting, 
and I see that life in the republic is in some respects better, 
in some respects more difficult. Prices have jumped. You have 
not adopted shock therapy. Are not some adjustments needed 
today, inasmuch as all of Russia is going a different way? 
  [Shaymiyev] The adjustments have already been made. We have 
now released prices on many commodities. Did you notice, come to 
that, that we now have the lowest prices for bread, milk, and 
dairy products in Russia? 
  [Vladina] A very marked difference! Although there are goods 
that are more expensive. 
  [Shaymiyev] The dairy products and bread are cheaper thanks 
to subsidies. These foods should be affordable to everyone. We 
are releasing the prices of other types of food, as in 
neighboring regions also. But an entirely different policy is 
being implemented here today: A program of targeted social 
protection of the populace has been activated. A very serious 
office has been created. We have converted one of our institutes 
furnished with computer equipment and possessing experienced 
personnel into a social studies and social problems center. A 
methods system according to which not a single person must find 
himself below the poverty line has been devised. According to 
the data bank, the information--this includes the consumer 
basket, several types of budget, minimum included, the 
subsistence minimum, definition of each stratum of the 
population by income, and so forth--is checked weekly (not 
monthly!). It has been hard work, but we have done a good thing, 
because it is now known with what and how each family is living. 
It is on the basis of this information that we adopt the social 
protection measures. Thus, each child, regardless of whether he 
is an urban or rural inhabitant, is specifically protected here 
now. There is protection also for retirees, who receive a 
pension according to our procedure: If the pension is small, it 
is raised to the subsistence minimum. 
  [Vladina] And what is the subsistence minimum here? 
  [Shaymiyev] It changes weekly, but has to be sufficient to 
ensure not even a subsistence--we have now adopted a somewhat 
higher plank--a social minimum, which includes the cost not only 
of foodstuffs but also the apartment charge, utilities, the 
purchase of basic necessities. 
  [Vladina] Do retirees travel free here? 
  [Shaymiyev] Thus far, yes. 
  [Vladina] It is said in Moscow that Tatarstan is behind in 
its payment of taxes to the federal coffers and that this is why 
it is better off. Is this right? 
  [Shaymiyev] No. We have now settled the tax affairs, having 
signed in the fourth quarter with the Russian Federation an 
agreement with which we are complying. But we have stuck to our 
opinion here that the republics and regions should not operate 
on the basis of a subsidy and that in settling up with the 
Russian treasury we should keep for ourselves a necessary amount 
of the revenue. We are not, therefore, nor will we be, sitting 
in the corridors of the Ministry of Finance either. This also is 
a firm position. There is another aspect of the matter also: 
Revenue depends on work. Tatarstan is accused of not paying 
sufficient taxes, but no one has inquired as to how Tatarstan is 
working. How is another region laying claim to a large piece of 
the pie working? How, for example, do the same 100 hectares of 
land in regions that are different, but similar in terms of 
climatic conditions, "work"? There is agricultural land, there 
is plowland. We need to see what each 100 hectares produces--how 
much grain, meat, milk, and other products. And let there be 
comparisons. Many people have forgotten about this now, 
unfortunately. We have high indicators. Agricultural products, 
in particular, have in the past two years grown more than ever 
before: from 8 to 11 percent in 1993. Without a developed 
agriculture, speaking about the success of the economy of any 
country with any social foundations is simply not serious. 
  [Vladina] You still have the previous parliament here. How 
were the events in Moscow on 3-4 October evaluated here? 
  [Shaymiyev] The present composition of the parliament of 
Tatarstan is a parliament of the perestroyka period. The entire 
path that we have negotiated thus far we have negotiated via 
decisions of the present parliament, beginning with the adoption 
of the Declaration of State Sovereignty, the Constitution, and 
all other laws. We could say that parliament is not 
restructuring the economy, not adopting fateful decisions.... 
But this parliament cannot be blamed for this. It is essential 
first to reform the Supreme Soviet. Life goes on, the multiparty 
system is becoming a rule of life--these are our present 
realities, whether we like it or not, whether the parties are 
good or bad. And if the parties insist that elections need to be 
conducted on a multiparty basis, we have to agree, their voice 
has to be heard. There is an argument for early elections. 
  [Vladina] Is your opinion on the events in Moscow on 3-4 
October identical to that of parliament? 
  [Shaymiyev] There can be no identical opinion at this 
time--either in Moscow or in the regions or throughout Russia. 
Just as there are no identical answers to the questions of the 
present day. Because there is a crisis in the country. A real 
crisis, which has been tackled in the most deplorable fashion. 
  [Vladina] You think it could have been tackled in some other 
way? 
  [Shaymiyev] Is this an "option" if it has been paid for at 
the cost of people's lives? 
  [Vladina] There is talk increasingly often today about 
Eurasian solidarity, but for many centuries Russians and Tatars 
have confirmed by deeds that living together is possible. What 
is Tatarstan's contribution to this process in Russia and the 
CIS? 
  [Shaymiyev] Half of the population of Tatarstan is composed 
of Tatars, half, representatives of other nationalities. And it 
has been the case for centuries that all have lived in peace and 
harmony. It is not just today. There were, it is true, attempts 
by various leaders of extreme forces to drive a wedge between 
people in the perestroyka period. But this was unsuccessful even 
under the conditions of an aggravated political situation. This 
phenomenon should be studied in greater depth for future use of 
the useful experience in the relations of Russia and the CIS. 
  Another, no less important, problem is the position of the 
Russian-speaking population in the republics of Central Asia and 
other republics. The problem cannot, I believe, nor need it be 
resolved merely by the movement of people to Russia. If there is 
a desire to leave, of course, this is another matter. But it 
should be remembered that people are bound by 
good-neighborliness cultivated by the life of many, many 
generations. 
  I wondered why I had no sense of oppression or fear in 
Tatarstan. This may be explained, of course, by the crime 
situation, which is calmer than in other regions: People go to 
the movies, the theater, the museum. Life goes on.... But it is 
not this that is the main thing. Perhaps it can be explained by 
belief, it is not yet exhausted! People are well disposed toward 
the authorities. It is odd, but they love the president. It had 
always seemed to me that a house could not be built on love 
alone. For from love to hatred it is but a single step. And I 
asked Mintimer Shaymiyev: Is it not frightening facing the 
people's love? 
  "Whether they love or do not love is still open to question, 
but there is a respectful attitude on the part of the absolute 
majority. And I believe that people are not afraid of me. 
Justifying their hopes is the main thing. And this imposes quite 
a commitment!"

<F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Likhachev, vice president of the </F>
Republic of Tatarstan, doctor of juridical sciences, and a 
corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic 
of Tatarstan: "Respect, Equality of Rights, Cooperation"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation and Republic of 
Tatarstan treaty "On the Demarcation of Subjects for Conducting 
and Mutually Delegating Powers Between Organs of State Authority 
of the Russian Federation and Organs of State Authority of the 
Republic of Tatarstan," was signed on 15 February 1994 in Moscow 
in a festive atmosphere by Russian Federation President B. 
Yeltsin and Republic of Tatarstan President M. Shaymiyev. 
  An event took place that was long awaited and that has no 
precedents. Expressing the will of the multiethnic people of 
Tatarstan and of the whole Russian Federation, the treaty makes 
a significant contribution to the revival of Russia and to the 
construction of a democratic federation. On the other hand, it 
performs a kind of summing up of the legal-state development of 
the Republic of Tatarstan under contemporary conditions from the 
moment of the adoption of the Declaration of the State 
Sovereignty of Tatarstan to the adoption of its new constitution 
of 1992. 
  The concluded treaty, undoubtedly, is of a reformative 
nature. With respect to it, the term "for the first time" can be 
used repeatedly. For the first time, it is bilateral; for the 
first time, it is in two languages (Tatar and Russian), and for 
the first time, it is signed at the highest level. The treaty 
was created in controversy, in a search for compromises, and in 
the resolution of difficult questions, ready answers to which 
simply did not exist in nature. The accumulated negotiating 
experience has political significance, and it is a new word in 
diplomacy. 
  But it also affirmed the value of such generally accepted 
categories in the civilized world as mutual respect, equality of 
rights, and cooperation. This is why, contrary to the aspiration 
of some political forces to belittle the fact of the signing of 
this historic document, it is possible to say with full 
confidence: There are no losers here. But there are winners. 
They are people of various nationalities, common sense, and 
courage. This, finally, is the common future of Russia and 
Tatarstan. 
  A detailed analysis of the treaty lies ahead, but it is very 
important today to emphasize its legitimacy. The treaty rests 
upon the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the 
Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, and, of course, upon 
the international legal obligations of the Russian Federation, 
in particular those that result from the generally accepted 
rights of people to self-determination and equality of rights. 
  The treaty opens with a preamble that sets forth the 
principles of unification of the Republic of Tatarstan as a 
state with the Russian Federation. Among these are 
voluntariness, territorial integrity, unity of the economic 
space, and preservation and development of historical and 
national traditions, cultures, and languages, and the priority 
of human rights and freedoms... 
  The subsequent articles disclose the exclusive powers of the 
Republic of Tatarstan, the Russian Federation, their organs, and 
also the joint powers. They encompass the political, 
socioeconomic, and spiritual spheres. The sides also coordinated 
the mechanisms for implementing these powers. The main ones 
among them will be intergovernmental agreements, other 
understandings, and joint commissions and structures. Already 
today, 11 agreements that regulate various questions (from 
environmental protection to coordination of the fight against 
crime) have begun to function. 
  The treaty is going into effect. In greeting all of the 
newspaper's readers with the holiday, we want to call on them to 
actively participate in the process of its implementation, and 
there is enough work for everyone. And as the ancient 
philosophers said, when you see great work ahead, you experience 
enormous joy. Especially since this work is for the people and 
for our children.

<F P=106> [Article by Azak Karimov, member of the RT [Tatarstan </F>
Republic] Constitutional Commission and candidate of juridical 
sciences: "A Treaty Between Sovereign States"] 
  [Text] We continue publication of materials analyzing 
the different aspects of the RF-RT [Russian Federation-Tatarstan 
Republic] Treaty. Today we draw readers' attention to a skillful 
juridical analysis of the document, together with a political 
analysis. 
  The Treaty on Demarcation of Subjects of Jurisdiction and 
Reciprocal Delegation of Powers Between Organs of State 
Authority of the Russian Federation and Organs of State 
Authority of the Tatarstan Republic, signed in Moscow on 15 
February 1994, is an important landmark in our republic's 
development as a sovereign state. It ranks with such documents 
as the republic's Declaration of State Sovereignty of 30 August 
1990 and the Tatarstan Republic Constitution of 6 November 1992. 
It is the fundamental document in which the most important 
questions in relations between our republic and the Russian 
Federation are resolved. As I see it, this is also its main 
purpose. 
  The treaty unquestionably will be the subject of intensive 
research by historians, economists, jurists, and other 
scientists. But even now a number of provisions may be pointed 
out which characterize it as a document that is not only 
original, but workable and equal to the Basic Law of the 
Tatarstan Republic. The treaty's text attests to the fact that 
the authorized representatives of Tatarstan were truly guided by 
the Tatarstan Republic Constitution when they signed it. And the 
entry on this in the treaty preamble was completely justified. 
  Confirmation of what has been stated may be seen in how 
questions concerning relationships between laws of the Tatarstan 
Republic and the Russian Federation on property, taxes, the 
judicial system, citizenship, and so forth, were resolved in the 
treaty. At the same time, of course, it is interesting to see 
how the matters cited were resolved in the Federative Treaty, 
which the Tatarstan Republic did not sign, as we know. 
  In the Federation, the relationship between the formal 
documents of federal organs and the organs of Federation 
subjects is what is most significant. 
  In the Federative Treaty, for example, the title paragraphs 
of the article on the subjects of joint jurisdiction by the 
Russian Federation and the republics which signed this treaty 
are the paragraphs providing for conformity between the 
constitutions and laws of the republics and the Constitution and 
laws of the Russian Federation, legality, and law and order. It 
also states there that on matters of joint jurisdiction, the 
federal organs promulgate the fundamentals of the law, in 
conformity with which the republics' organs of authority 
promulgate their own law and other formal legal documents (Part 
2, Article II). 
  There are no such provisions in the treaty between the 
Tatarstan Republic and the Russian Federation. 
  Further. While disputes between organs of the RF and the 
republics on matters of joint jurisdiction are resolved in 
accordance with the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitutional 
Court (Part 3, Article VI), disputes between RF and RT organs 
"are resolved in a procedure coordinated between them" (RT-RF 
Treaty, Part 3, Article VI). In the event that the sides adopt 
laws which conflict with the treaty, the sides have the right to 
appeal against them (Part 2, Article VI). In the Federative 
Treaty, this matter is resolved by different means: if the 
republics promulgate documents on matters of Russian Federation 
jurisdiction, an offical act of the RF will come into force. It 
also states there that RF organs may not promulgate documents on 
matters related to the republics' jurisdiction. But what would 
the consequences be if they did promulgate them anyway? This is 
an open question. 
  Let us turn to property and tax matters. 
  The RT-RF Treaty, in conformity with the RT Constitution, 
states that its organs of state authority independently "resolve 
the problems of jurisdiction, use, and disposal of lands, 
mineral resources, and water, forestry, and other natural 
resources..." (Paragraph 6, Part 2, Article II). In other words, 
the RT-RF Treaty confirms the exclusive right of the Tatarstan 
Republic itself to dispose of the property owned by the people 
of Tatarstan. Meanwhile, in the Federative Treaty and the RF 
Constitution, these questions are grouped with joint 
jurisdiction of the RF and the republics, with all the 
consequences stemming from this. 
  The matter of taxes. Taxes are basic sources for the budget 
of any state, and for this reason, it is important who sets them 
and collects them. The RT-RF Treaty clearly differentiates 
between the federal and republic (RT) taxes, which are set and 
collected accordingly by federal and republic (RT) organs. In 
the RT-RF Treaty, the question of taxes is excluded from the 
matters of joint jurisdiction, unlike in the Federative Treaty 
and the RF Constitution. 
  An important question, which I would say is very often 
raised 
sharply in considering the sovereign rights of the Tatarstan 
Republic, relates to its international and foreign economic 
relations. And of course, it should have been reflected in the 
RT-RF Treaty. And the authority to coordinate international and 
foreign economic relations is actually included among the powers 
which are exercised jointly by RT and RF organs of state 
authority. It seems to me that this refers here to activity 
which is conducted with equal rights on a mutually acceptable 
basis. The Federative Treaty states that coordination of the 
republics' international and foreign economic relations is 
conducted by RF federal organs, though jointly with the 
republics. 
  Let us return to the system of state organs, which is 
probably the matter of most importance. I note with satisfaction 
that it was resolved in the RT-RF Treaty in complete conformity 
with the status of our republic, which has been consolidated in 
its constitution. Paragraph 7, Article II of the treaty states 
that the Tatarstan Republic's organs of state authority 
"establish the system of state organs of the Tatarstan Republic 
and the procedure for their organization and activity." Whereas 
the RF Constitution, for example, states that "a system of 
organs of state authority of the republics, krays...is 
established by subjects of the Russian Federation in conformity 
with the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the 
general principles for organizing representative and executive 
organs of state authority established by federal law." 
  The courts are important links in the system of state 
organs. 
The question of these organs, or more precisely, of their 
transfer to the exclusive jurisdiction of the RT, has been 
raised repeatedly in sessions of the RT Supreme Soviet. It 
should be said that this is a very delicate problem. The point 
is that as soon as we put the provision for and protection of 
citizens' rights in first place in the state's activity 
(Paragraph 1, Part 2, Art. II, Paragraph 1, Art. III of the 
RT-RF Treaty), we cannot deprive a person and citizen of the 
opportunity to defend himself and to turn to any court for this 
purpose. Incidentally, in RT courts, for example, there has not 
been one case when a citizen convicted by an RT court was denied 
referral of a complaint to the Supreme Court of the RF, giving 
the reason that this is the court "of another state." 
  There is another side to the question. Paragraph 2, Art. 19 
of our republic's Constitution states: "Citizens of the 
Tatarstan Republic hold citizenship in the Russian 
Federation--Russia." For this reason, depriving anyone of the 
opportunity to seek additional protection, in the RF Supreme 
Court, let us say, is a violation of his constitutional right, a 
violation of the RT Constitution. The RT-RF Treaty states that 
the judicial system is under the jurisdiction of the Russian 
Federation and its organs for this reason (Paragraph 13, Art. 
III). So the RT Constitution has not been violated in resolving 
this matter. Moreover, in conformity with it and Paragraph 5, 
Part 2, Art. II of the treaty, organs of state authority of the 
Tatarstan Republic have been given the right to pardon persons 
convicted by RT courts. 
  The question of citizenship is also a delicate matter. The 
Federative Treaty has a provision only on Russian Federation 
citizenship, but the RF Constitution refers to regulation of 
citizenship in the Russian Federation by federal organs, which 
indirectly assumes citizenship in the republics. 
  In the RT-RF Treaty, first of all, citizenship in the 
Tatarstan Republic is recognized unequivocally; this is 
reflected in the authority of its organs of state authority to 
resolve republic citizenship matters. 
  Secondly, common and conflicting questions of citizenship 
are 
cited among the matters of joint RT-RF jurisdiction (Paragraph 
8, Part 2, Art. II, Paragraph 4, Art. II). 
  In the aspect considered in this article, the form of the 
document which consolidates the agreement reached between 
empowered RT and RF representatives on demarcation of the 
subjects of jurisdiction and reciprocal delegation of powers is 
important as well. 
  This document was drawn up as a treaty, which is used as the 
main form of juridical presentation in interstate relations. It 
was put together in two languages--Tatar and Russian, and the 
texts in both languages have equal force. In the RT-RF Treaty, 
unlike the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitution, the 
sections on the subjects of jurisdiction are arranged 
differently. While the Federative Treaty and the RF Constitution 
put the sections dealing with the subjects of RF jurisdiction in 
first place, the subjects of joint jurisdiction in second place, 
and the republics' jurisdiction in last place, the RT-RF Treaty 
puts the powers of the Tatarstan Republic on subjects under its 
jurisdiction in first place. It should also be pointed out that 
this treaty has no fixed term. 
  Both time and active work by the appropriate RT and RF 
organs 
will be needed to fully implement it. For this purpose, the 
treaty itself provides for the possibility that additional 
agreements may be concluded, and joint structures and 
commissions may be established on an equal footing, that is, 
with participation by representatives of the sides with equal 
rights, as well as the conclusion of agreements on specific 
questions related to RT jurisdiction (Paragraphs 6, 12, 13, and 
14, Part 2, Art. II) and joint RT-RF jurisdiction (Paragraphs 3, 
9, and 11, Art. III). 
  Other aspects of the treaty could have been examined, 
although I believe the arguments cited above make it possible to 
say: the RT-RF Treaty is the result of voluntary agreement 
between partners with equal rights. It is in complete conformity 
with the Constitution of the Tatarstan Republic.

<F P=106> [Public opinion survey by the "Inform-Klub ES" Agency </F>
reported by Guzaliya Mansurova: "Guesswork on the Eve of the 
Elections"] 
  [Text] Marriages are made in Heaven, as we know, but 
contracts with the devil are signed in blood. Against this 
background, the Russian-Tatar treaty signed in the Moscow 
Kremlin with pen and ink is very banal. But the emotions it 
evoked put it in the center of public attention. For this 
reason, a sampling of the elite polled in the February survey 
conducted by the sociological service of the "Inform-Klub ES" 
were asked to express their view of the treaty. 
  In assessing the treaty demarcating the powers and subjects 
of jurisdiction between Russia and Tatarstan, 72 percent of 
those polled expressed a positive attitude toward this document, 
6 percent thought that "the enemies of sovereignty" in Moscow 
had deceived our president, 4 percent had difficulty making an 
assessment, and finally, 18 percent of the respondents decided 
to comment, stating that 1) a lean comproimise is better than a 
fat lawsuit; 2) despite the lack of specifics in the wording and 
the possible short duration of the treaty, it is still the basis 
for strengthening relations between the RT [Tatarstan Republic] 
and the RF [Russian Federation]; and 3) the treaty guarantees 
the existence of two political elites without confrontation. One 
of the respondents assessed the Moscow agreements as a treaty 
between two presidents which cannot be compared with the 
Constitution as far as legitimacy is concerned, in his view, and 
it is consequently illegal. The noted Tatar author Dias Valeyev 
noted sadly that this document reminds him of an agreement 
between two decks of the sinking "Titanic." 
  Some respondents noted the unusual nature of the treaty in 
world juridical practice, calling the Tatarstan Republic and the 
Russian Federation pioneers in the field of new political 
realities. 
  The last paragraph in the survey was dictated by the treaty 
itself. This document assumes that permanent representations of 
Russia and Tatarstan will be established in Kazan and Moscow, 
respectively. A representation of Tatarstan is already 
functioning in Moscow, but who will be representing RF interests 
in Kazan? 
  Our respondents named R. Abdulatilov, S. Shakhray, and Zh. 
Semenov as candidates for this position. However, most of those 
polled had difficulty in determining the personality of a 
plenipotentiary representative, limiting themselves to 
definitions such as: a Kazan Tatar (46 percent), or a Moscow 
Tatar, possibly of Kazan extraction (40 percent). The 
overwhelming majority are certain that it will be a person who 
is familiar with local details, and that his candidacy will be 
coordinated with the President of Tatarstan. That is, Moscow 
will not send a complete "foreigner." 
  By not expecting a foreigner among its own, however, 
Tatarstan should make a determination about just who will 
represent it "among the foreigners." Seven surnames should be 
designated in elections to the Russian parliament: two to the 
Council of the Federation and five to the State Duma. 
  We asked representatives of the Kazan sampling to give the 
names of possible winners in three electoral 
districts--Tatarskiy, Moskovskiy, and Privolzhskiy. Some 84 
percent of those polled believe that Mintimer Shaymiyev will 
represent the republic's interests in the Council of the 
Federation, 62 percent thought that Farid Mukhametshin would 
receive the mandate as deputy together with him, and 12 percent 
named Aleksandr Lozovoy. Such a spread in the figures was not 
seen in determining the possible deputies for the lower chamber 
of parliament. In Moskovskiy District, there were three 
favorites: Vladimir Belyayev (46 percent), Yuriy Voronin (20 
percent), and Oleg Morozov (12 percent). In Privolzhskiy 
District, the ones named were Valentin Mikhaylov (44 percent), 
Rais Belyayev (14 percent), and Yuriy Reshetov (12 percent). 
Respondents noted that surprises are possible in Privolzhskiy 
District because of the large number of candidates. 
  A traditional question in our express surveys has been 
determination of the average income per family member. The Kazan 
elite are not threatened with starvation at present, for in 
recalculating for daily bread, each member of it was able to buy 
an average of 195.5 loaves of black bread per month. And this 
means finding the sum required out of his 110,000 rubles [R] in 
average monthly income to meet certain other needs, but ones 
that are not too refined. And once again, the "picture of 
financial prosperity" of the Kazan elite has been slightly 
spoiled by the representatives of science, those professors who 
either have not received any wage at all or received only part 
of it. They set the per capita income of their families at about 
R20,000 to R40,000. 
  There are legends and anecdotes about the vital optimism of 
our people. Neither 300 years of rule by the Romanovs nor 74 
years of Soviet authority have been able to shake it. At the 
beginning of 1994, our respondents were satisfied with 66 
percent of their lives. This is a general indicator which covers 
finances, personal contacts, and housing. The situation is worst 
with finances--representatives of the elite say that the incomes 
being received enable them to achieve 57 percent of what they 
desire. At the same time, 47 percent is the satisfaction 
indicator for male scientists and 66 percent for businessmen. 
These and others, such as journalists, politicians, managers, 
and artists, arrange contacts with people to a much greater 
extent, meeting 80 percent of their requirements. 
  A few words about housing. Remember in "Master and 
Margarit," 
when Voland says: "They aren't bad people, but the apartment 
problem has spoiled them." Judging by that, the Kazan elite is 
satisfied with 77 percent of its housing conditions, and 
shortcomings of this nature should be justified by something 
else. 
  In completing the political and economic group, we cannot 
help but mention that our respondents assessed the economic 
situation in Tatarstan this time at 2.9 points, and in Russia as 
a whole at 2.5 points, as before. 
  Not only the elections await us in March. There is also a 
women's holiday on 8 March. On the threshold of this day, we 
have asked the male part of Kazan's professional elite to 
express their wishes for the better half of humanity. Some 22 
percent of those polled wished the women love, and love of 
various types--from love for men to love from men. In the 
opinion of the other representatives of the elite, there should 
be love as well as peace of mind, stability, a good frame of 
mind, rejuvenation and improvement in physical characteristics 
from year to year, and a great deal of money. This combination 
will enable the women to continue to be women to make the men 
happy. Joining in the general flow of congratulations, Aleksandr 
Tarkayev, chairman of the Tatarstan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, wished the women the chance to work not for economic 
necessity but guided exclusively by personal inclination. There 
were also calls to make a historical shift from masculinization 
and feminization and not to confuse 8 March with 23 February 
(the second Russian revolution began on 8 March, according to 
the new calendar, with the demonstration by female workers in 
St. Petersburg). 
  As far as the better half of our sampling is concerned, it 
wished that the men would continue to be men. Even on 8 March.

<F P=106> [Two views of Russia-Tatarstan treaty: "Moscow-Kazan: The </F>
Peoples Are Moving, Moving Ahead"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  Vyacheslav Nikonov, Russian Federation State Duma Deputy </H6>
  Inasmuch as Tatarstan had in recent years fallen 
increasingly 
far out of the legal space of Russia, the fact that a formula 
has been found with the aid of which it has essentially returned 
to this fold can only be welcomed. This was possible largely 
thanks to the new Russian Constitution, which, unfortunately, 
does not create a full-fledged federation but affords an 
opportunity for more flexible relations between the center and 
the components of the Russian Federation. 
  To what extent such a form as a treaty is at all acceptable 
in a normal federation is another matter. It is hard to imagine 
a treaty between, say, the U.S. Government and the state of 
Massachusetts. But we are in transition as yet from a unitary 
state to a federative state, from the old concept of 
national-state arrangement to the idea of a symmetrical 
federation. And from this viewpoint the conclusion of the treaty 
is an entirely permissible act. 
  The treaty does not, in my view, alter the status of the 
Republic of Tatarstan and does not add sovereignty to it, it 
contains altogether no mention of sovereignty, although it says 
that Tatarstan is entitled to pursue international relations 
independently. This may be interpreted both as the fact that it 
is a subject of international law and as the fact that it is not 
such. The treaty has not, in principle, cleared up this problem 
but, once again, if we take some other federations--the United 
States again--we see that in each state there is a state 
secretary, essentially a minister of foreign affairs, and that 
the state pursues an original foreign policy, which is confined, 
it is true, to a very narrow range of issues. That is, there is 
nothing so terrible in this either. 
  The treaty draws quite strict terms of reference between 
Tatarstan and the Federation and determines quite a wide range 
of joint powers. The list of issues that remain within the 
jurisdiction of the Russian Federation is quite voluminous, and 
Tatarstan, naturally, has an interest in these matters being 
decided at Federation level. Consequently, it now has a direct 
interest in participating in the work of the federal authorities. 
  The treaty delicately and competently skirts the problem of 
contradictions between the constitutions of the Russian 
Federation and Tatarstan. In my view, the best way of 
delineating authority between the center and the components is 
when the prerogatives of the center are simply determined, and 
everything else remains "local." It is good, therefore, that the 
parties to the treaty did not become obsessed with whose 
constitution--that of Russia or Tatarstan--is "higher" but 
established that there is a sphere of activity within the 
competence of the federal government, there is a sphere of joint 
competence, and so forth. 
  We do not currently have equality of the components of the 
Federation. And there is, of course, a certain danger that the 
treaty with Tatarstan will serve as an incentive to a further 
"parade of treaties" for the center and the republics. It may be 
anticipated that at some stage the krays and oblasts also will 
want to formalize treaty relations with the central power. But I 
would not be inclined to dramatize the situation. The fears in 
connection with the collapse of Russia are altogether 
exaggerated, and a gravitation toward reintegration has 
manifestly been revealed today. It seems to me, for example, 
that Tatarstan displayed in the conclusion of the treaty greater 
flexibility than the central power. It dropped certain of its 
demands in the sphere of political sovereignization and division 
of the economic space, Kazan has agreed to pay taxes to the 
federal treasury, the creation of joint regional development 
funds is contemplated, and so forth. 
<H6>  Nikolay Sorokin, ITAR-TASS correspondent for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA </H6>
  The news of the signing of the treaty with Russia has been 
greeted in restrained fashion in Tatarstan. To rejoice or wait 
and see? I have been calling acquaintances and asking them to 
comment on a document, the like of which Tatarstan has never 
signed throughout its history. But all have been politely 
refusing, referring to the fact that they are not familiar with 
the text as yet. 
  The treaty was born in difficult labor and in argument and 
doubt. Progress toward it was made perseveringly, step by step, 
at the price of mutual compromise over a period of almost three 
years. There were in Tatarstan not only supporters but also 
opponents of a normalization of relations with Moscow, about 
which President Mintimer Shaymiyev said heatedly on the eve of 
the signing of the treaty: "There are politicians, who are 
guided by the principle: 'the worse, the better', who are 
opposed to all negotiations with Russia, which they call a 
neighboring state." At one demonstration, incidentally, the 
crowd sentenced Shaymiyev for participation in the negotiations 
to... death, notifying him of this by telegram. 
  Defeating the Kazan "ultras" by argument is impossible, but 
their "trump" arguments are not now seen as being that 
substantial. The treaty affords Tatarstan complete freedom in 
foreign economic relations. Without waiting for the signing of 
this document, incidentally, the republic had already formed a 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and a Department for 
Foreign Affairs. Business contacts have been established with 
companies, banks, and cultural and social organizations of the 
United States, Turkey, Hungary, and South Korea, and treaties 
have been concluded with almost all "natives" of the former 
Union. Thus cellular communications, which will enable Tatarstan 
in three years to move in terms of level of individual telephone 
subscribers from 66th place in Russia into the top 10, are being 
introduced in the republic in conjunction with the American 
Hughes Network Systems. 
  The particular value of the treaty between Russia and 
Tatarstan is that an instrument of its 
realization--intergovernmental agreements--is proposed 
simultaneously. Eleven such agreements have been adopted thus 
far--on the budget, property, customs, the environment, the 
defense sectors, transport, communications, and others. The 
Tatar National Bank, for example, although remaining a 
structural subdivision of the Central Bank of Russia, has 
acquired great operating scope: It may now, at its own 
discretion, restructure the network of its branches and allocate 
credit independently, without Central Bank involvement, for 
priority programs for the republic. 
  The treaty that has been adopted is, in Mintimer Shaymiyev's 
opinion, only the first step. Having declared in the Kremlin: 
"We shall not stop here," he made his Moscow colleagues quite 
wary, but hereupon reassured them: Tatarstan, having initiated 
the treaty relationship, will shortly propose the next 
program--for decentralization of the Russian economy. 
  And the people of Tatarstan will make their evaluation of 
the 
treaty at the repeat Federal Assembly elections, which are 
scheduled for 13 March. The candidates for deputy, among whom is 
President Mintimer Shaymiyev, were registered on 16 February, 
incidentally.

<F P=106> [Republic of Tatarstan Press-tsentr KM report on German </F>
businessmen's visit] 
  [Text] On 23 February M. Sabirov, prime minister of 
Tatarstan, received a delegation of representatives of a number 
of major companies, firms, and banks of the FRG headed by Herr 
H.-G. Pohl, director of the Board of Guardians. 
  Dependable relations were established with them during the 
recent visit to Germany of a government delegation of Tatarstan. 
  M. Sabirov notified the visitors that a notable historical 
event--the signing by the leaders of the Russian Federation and 
the Republic of Tatarstan of an interstate treaty--had taken 
place in the life of Tatarstan. Eleven important 
intergovernmental agreements have been concluded within the 
framework thereof. One of them is in the sphere of foreign 
economic relations; it legally enshrines, in particular, our 
republic's right to engage in independent foreign economic 
activity with states of the world community. 
  The head of the delegation congratulated the prime minister 
on this event and expressed the hope that the treaty would lend 
new impetus to the development of mutually profitable trade and 
economic cooperation between Tatarstan and the Federal Republic 
of Germany. 
  During the negotiations the parties exchanged opinions on a 
number of matters of mutual interest. Paths of an expansion and 
intensification of the charted relations in the sphere of the 
conversion of defense plants located on the territory of 
Tatarstan, the privatization of enterprises of industry, trade, 
and services, and the use of German technologies in the 
republic's agricultural production and mutually profitable 
commodity exchange were outlined. Great attention was paid to 
the realization of a number of joint projects. Modernization of 
the capacity of the Nizhnekamskneftekhim production association 
and others, for example. 
  Possibilities of the long-term allocation of loans for 
republic programs thanks to government credit of the FRG of up 
to DM10 billion were determined. 
  Prime Minister M. Sabirov and Herr H.-G. Pohl signed a 
statement of intent on cooperation between the Government of the 
Republic of Tatarstan and the FRG Board of Guardians. 
  The program of the German guests' visit to Tatarstan 
includes 
a visit to a number of enterprises, firms, and banks of our 
republic and familiarization with their product for the purpose

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Lukashov: "Milli Mejlis Demands </F>
Resignation of President of Tatariya; Congress Opposes Elections 
to Federal Assembly of Russia"] 
  [Text] Last weekend, the 2nd special kurultay (congress) of 
the Tatar people was held in Kazan, drawing around 400 delegates 
from various regions of Russia and the CIS, but primarily from 
Tatariya. 
  The congress was an "expanded variant" of the Milli Mejlis, 
the national parliament, which aspires to the role of expressor 
of the interests of all the Tatar people. Anyone who bothered to 
show up, fill out a form and receive a mandate could become a 
delegate. 
  The task of the congress was to elect a new membership and 
chairman (reis) of the Milli Mejlis. The previous chairman, 
Talgat Abdullin, had been given the position of chief 
administrator of the newly created semi-state bank, "Ak bars." 
The national parliament handled this task without any 
significant problems: A membership of the Milli Mejlis 
consisting of 25 persons was elected, and the rather well-known 
Fauziya Bayramova, leader of the Tatar party for national 
independence, "Ittifak," became the chairman. 
  Here, at the congress, Ms. Bayramova was given her first 
task: To begin collecting signatures demanding "to hold a 
referendum on the independence of the Republic of Tatarstan." 
  Without a doubt, this decision was a reaction to the 15 
February signing of the agreement between Kazan and Moscow, 
which was evaluated as a "tragedy of the Tatar people" and a 
"betrayal of the interests of our children." In this connection, 
the new chairman announced that those who had signed the 
agreement for Tatariya (President Shaymiyev and Prime Minister 
Sabirov--SEGODNYA) did not have the authority to give their 
signatures, since they had not asked the opinion of the people. 
"As of 15 February, Shaymiyev is not president for us. And in 
general, the institution of the presidency in Tatarstan must be 
abolished," said Ms. Bayramova. The delegates to the congress 
also did not agree with references to the fact that the 
agreement had been signed in accordance with the constitutions 
of Russia and Tatariya. "We have no other constitution except 
the Koran," it was heard from the podium. Moreover, it was 
specified that the Constitution of Russia "is irrelevant here," 
since "as of 1552 (the time of taking of Kazan by the forces of 
Ivan the Terrible--SEGODNYA), we have been in a state of war 
with Russia." 
  An appeal was adopted calling for the citizens of the 
"sovereign state of Tatarstan" not to participate in the 
elections to the Federal Assembly of the "neighboring state of 
Russia" which were scheduled for 13 March, so as to demonstrate 
their disagreement with the signing of the agreement. And 
generally, in the opinion of deputies of the Milli Mejlis, the 
time has come "to raise the Tatar people up in the struggle for 
their independence." 
  The delegates elected the scientist-chemist Vil Mirzayanov 
as 
honorary member of the Milli Mejlis, and also adopted a 
resolution expressing their indignation regarding the fact of 
his arrest. 
  The measure which had passed, in the opinion of local 
observers, demonstrated even more clearly the schism between the 
different wings of the once unified Tatar National-Patriotic 
Movement. For example, delegates from the radical committee, 
"Sovereignty," and a number of others left the auditorium after 
the first meeting, while in the auditorium itself there were 
frequent outbursts of heated debate, turning at times to open 
swearing and sometimes even to fistfights. 
  Many believe that the reason for the discord within the 
Tatar 
national movement is concealed not in political, but in personal 
differences of the individual leaders. Therefore, we cannot 
exclude the possibility that in the near future another two or 
three milli medlis may emerge in Tatariya, and exclusively for 
the purpose of satisfying the personal ambitions of the 
"fighters for freedom of the Tatar people." 
  As we know, the sum is not altered when the addends change 
place. And even if the total weight of the national-patriotic 
organizations of Tatariya is equal to what it was before, 
nevertheless the coefficient of their influence on political 
life in the republic will still be close to zero. Before, 
President Shaymiyev needed them to frighten Moscow with the 
possibility of national conflicts. The national-patriots 
fulfilled their task--with the aid of meetings, by storming 
government buildings, through extremist slogans, etc. 
  Now the republic's leadership is faced with the task of 
neutralizing the national-patriots. Having analyzed the 
conflicts within the All-Tatar Public Center, the "Ittifak" 
Party and all the other subjects of the Tatar national movement, 
we may conclude that this process is close to its completion. 
  In the opinion of observers, today the Tatar 
National-Patriotic Movement can only be saved by a striking 
personality, although not such an odious one as Fauziya 
Bayramova. However, it can also not be the former teacher of the 
history of the CPSU, and today president of one of the wings of 
the VTOTs [All-Tatar Public Center], Marat Mulyukov. Then again, 
if we take as truth the fact that the only constitution for the 
deputies of the Milli Mejlis is the Koran, then among them, who 
are besieging the buffet tables despite the fast which is to be 
observed during the current Islamic holy month of Ramazan, we 
will not be able to find such an individual.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Equality and Legality' Gets Ready </F>
for the Elections"] 
  [Text] Last Saturday a conference was held by the "Equality 
and Legality" [RIZ] electoral bloc. The bloc was founded early 
in 1992 and was registered at the Tatarstan Ministry of Justice 
on 27 January 1994. 
  At the conference three candidate deputies from the RIZ bloc 
presented their programs: V. Belyayev, leader of the 
multinational movement "Accord," from Moskovskiy Okrug No. 24; 
V. Mikhaylov, Tatarstan Supreme Soviet people's deputy, from 
Privolzhskiy Okrug No. 27; and Yu. Rostovshchikov, deputy 
chairman of the Vakhitovskiy rayon soviet and leader of the 
Tatarstan social democrats, from Naberezhno-Chelninskiy Okrug 
No. 25. 
  The participants at the conference were greatly concerned by 
the fact that there are several prodemocratic candidates running 
for election in the okrugs. The general opinion was that this 
situation could lead to the scattering of the votes of 
democratically inclined voters and to the defeat of the 
democrats in the elections, particularly in the Privolzhskiy 
Okrug. 
  Therefore, a resolution was passed recommending that parties 
and movements belonging to the "Equality and Legality" bloc 
refrain from supporting candidates not nominated by the bloc. 
  After the resolution was passed a press conference was held 
by Russian State Duma Deputy I. Grachev and candidate deputies 
V. Belyayev, V. Mikhaylov, and Yu. Rostovshchikov.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Zharinov under the rubric "Political </F>
Commentary": "The President Has Spoken. What Can Russian 
Citizens Expect?"] 
  [Text] After that memorable Thursday when President Boris 
Yeltsin spoke in the Federal Assembly, an awkward pause ensued 
in the political life of Russian citizens. The press and the 
public suddenly switched to comments on, or rather criticism of, 
the State Duma decree on political amnesty for the prisoners of 
"Sailor's Rest" and "Lefortovo" and the sudden removal of the 
General Procurator of the Russian Federation from his post. 
Hysteria again sounded over the impending civil war and a 
repetition of the tragedy of 1 May 1993. 
  Seemingly overshadowed by these idle lamentations was a 
sober 
and detailed analysis of the President's Message and his "role 
in the fate of the future Russia." The latter sounds somewhat 
stilted, but it is customary to the philistine's ears. "For the 
first time Russia has received a concrete program of 
development." "The Message contains quite a powerful charge." 
The authors of such assessments are as a rule people from the 
president's circle who directly or indirectly participated in 
preparing the February theses "On Strengthening the Russian 
State" (A. Yakovlev, Yu. Baturin, and G. Satarov). 
  We who have already heard a considerable number of 
perestroyka speeches in recent years are already familiar with 
the "epoch-making syndrome." And for that reason we do not 
immediately take everything on faith. But if we are talking 
specifically about the Message, generally speaking I would treat 
it in a somewhat more restrained manner. Roughly the same as 
Academician L. Abalkin, chairman of the State Duma Committee on 
International Affairs V. Lukin, and many others who called the 
Message a "calculated political statement." 
  Perhaps the strongest thing in the Message is that "true 
economic focuses weighing on the general political situation in 
society" are finally put in place. The analysis is harsh and 
merciless and contains criticism of the hard blows and lack of 
careful thought and of the radical, monetarist methods of 
becoming a market economy. 
  Self-criticism and frank admission of his own guilt are 
lacking in this bitter presidential analysis, it seems to me. B. 
N. Yeltsin's complaint regarding growing national poverty and 
the "rapid social stratification of society," for example, left 
a painful and at the same time discouraging impression on many 
people I have talked with recently. The authorities in the 
center and local ones, don't you see, seem not to notice this! 
But was it really not clear before what this "all-economic 
freedom of the market" and the creation of the free owner at any 
cost and at a Stalinist pace would become? 
  Exactly the same methods were used during the destatization 
of the economy ("Let us smash the monster!") and 
decollectivization ("Give us 100,000 private farmers and we will 
turn Russia around!"). They smashed it and they turned Russia 
around... But what have they created? So far not much. As the 
Message emphasizes, "There is more freedom in our country," and 
more and more Russian citizens are alas suffering from it. 
  Although the president's address does not provide answers to 
many fundamental questions, there are a considerable number of 
new revelations and revealing statements in it: "The previous 
variant of the reforms has exhausted itself," "Optimal methods 
for the state to participate in economic processes are needed," 
"The `survival of the fittest' principle is destructive." Has 
the ice begun to break? We shall see. 
  The points in the chapters "The Law-Governed State" and "The 
Individual in a Democratic State" seem attractive and generally 
do not arouse any objection. Or I should say their leitmotif 
seems so: "Toward strengthening of statehood and civil peace and 
accord, as well as rejection of the practice of senseless 
confrontation in society." 
  True, just words. Unfortunately, they have frequently been 
pronounced in recent times both from behind the Kremlin walls 
and from the parliamentary rostrum. And heated political storms 
have at times followed them. But all the same, the hope remains 
that they will not become stale and lose their original meaning.

<F P=106> [Interview, under the rubric "Election-94," with Boris </F>
Konovalov, acting editor in chief of the daily paper MOLODOST 
SIBIRI, conducted by Vladimir Kuzmenkin; date and place not 
given] 
  [Text] The acting editor in chief of the daily paper 
MOLODOST SIBIRI, Boris Konovalov, is not a person new to 
politics. As a people's deputy of the Russian Federation, he 
represented Novosibirsk Oblast in the deputy contingent which... 
We will not go on; one election has already passed since that 
time and the second one is at hand, as they say. Several 
journalists from Novosibirsk newspapers immediately announced 
their intention to run for the oblast soviet, and among them was 
Boris Konovalov. He tells the VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK columnist 
the reasons for this decision. 
  [Kuzmenkin] Many people have called Boris Konovalov a 
potential candidate for deputy to the State Duma, and, 
incidentally, considered his chances quite good. 
  [Konovalov] Yes, I did intend to. I had a sense of work left 
undone. Right now the economic projects I was working on are 
beginning to be realized. For example, a large Russian-German 
agricultural community is being built near Novosibirsk. Money 
was gotten out of Goskomnats [State Committee for Nationalities 
Policy] and in Germany for this idea. Russian refugees from 
Central Asia will be able to settle here, by the way. 
  [Kuzmenkin] Is all this just plans or is it already actual 
work? 
  [Konovalov] The work is already underway and the community 
of 
Goluboy Zaliv not far from Akademgorodok will be turned over by 
the builders this summer. What will it do for us? Jobs under 
conditions of rising unemployment plus the potential to supply 
Novosibirsk with wood products. In 1-2 years there will be a 
return from the project to which I devoted considerable time and 
effort. 
  [Kuzmenkin] It is probably useful to recall what Deputy 
Konovalov did in parliament. 
  [Konovalov] I worked on the mass information media 
committee, 
where I was involved in issues of the SMI [mass information 
media] economy. We tried to follow our own line, but we were 
pressured both from the radical democrats and from the 
communists and patriots who believed that the system for aiding 
SMI should be political in nature. Unfortunately, many projects 
which we prepared, the creation of tax benefits for SMI, for 
example, encountered a great deal of opposition--both in 
parliament and in the government. I do not think I have to 
explain why. However, to the extent we could, we tried to 
protect the independence of the press. In addition we worked on 
those legislative bills which went through the Supreme Soviet, 
plus routine work in the district. I held about 50 receptions 
and there were 50-60 people at each one. 
  Inasmuch as a deputy cannot distribute cars or apartments, I 
took it as my job to restore justice, that is to say, I handled 
particular situations. Incidentally, in the elections to the 
Duma I selected "my own" district. 
  [Kuzmenkin] But the well-known events which resulted in the 
division of MOLODEZHKI into two publications occurred. 
  [Konovalov] There are various processes underway in any 
collective. New leaders rise and want to make themselves known 
and believe that they can be on top. Those people who arrived 
without me have now left and are quietly producing a new 
newspaper. The same people who know me or who worked with me 
continue to produce the newspaper MOLODOST SIBIRI. 
  [Kuzmenkin] Does that mean the crisis has passed? 
  [Konovalov] Undoubtedly. Our newspaper is already 70 years 
old, and it has seen everything in its life. I can say that 
because I have been working here for 13 years myself. The 
newspaper will live--there is no doubt of that. 
  [Kuzmenkin] How was the return trip, from parliament to 
journalism? 
  [Konovalov] I believe that journalism is a very complex 
thing. Although I have lived through two putsches, and the 
second one in direct proximity to the battle sites (a shell fell 
in the office next to mine in the White House--luckily I was not 
in my office), I still believe that the profession of journalist 
on energy costs is a lofty one and requires stricter 
organization of labor. 
  [Kuzmenkin] Let us return to where we started: Today the 
name 
Konovalov is again listed among the other names which are 
candidates for deputies to the oblast soviet. The question is 
therefore a simple one. Why is all this necessary? 
  [Konovalov] I again chose part of my former district, since 
I 
believe that it shows a lack of seriousness and respectability 
to run around to different districts in search of particular 
options. If you work with people, you are responsible to them. I 
must try to resolve the problems of those people whom I worked 
with as a people's deputy of the Russian Federation. 
Unfortunately, there are no fewer problems today. 
  [Kuzmenkin] So the oblast soviet will be able to deal with 
these problems. Did I understand correctly? 
  [Konovalov] It seems to me that the political struggle will 
be reduced to a minimum in the new deputy contingent; and it 
will regulate the socioeconomic interests of various strata of 
society. Of course there will also be groups of lobbyists who 
will begin to stand up for their professional and territorial 
interests. Therefore, in order to deal with the situation and 
make a competent decision, the oblast soviet needs independent 
deputies who have experience, both life experience and political 
experience. As for me personally, the work in the Supreme Soviet 
provided invaluable experience. Of course, I could have remained 
in Moscow and taken a high official post--I had such offers, but 
I believe that one has to live and work at home. 
  I also have economic experience, so to speak. I was closely 
involved in the economic [nongovernmental] press on the republic 
scale and therefore studied banking too. And I have the 
experience of participating in resolving social problems: By 
virtue of my deputy activity, I worked on it on business trips 
to different oblasts of Russia and also visited a hotspot, 
Northern Ossetia. 
  [Kuzmenkin] So in general, the editor in chief of MOLODOST 
SIBIRI is of the opinion that something can be done, right? 
  [Konovalov] I believe that one of the basic jobs of the 
oblast soviet will be monitoring the administration's actions. 
Administrators are now running for election to the oblast 
soviet--they have been assigned an appropriate task. A not quite 
correct situation comes about, in my opinion, as in the saying 
about the mice the cat was guarding. Subordinates will analyze 
the work of their boss--it is amusing at least. Of course they 
will say, "We know how things stand," but that is what they are 
administrators for, through their activity to ensure normal life 
in the rayons. Deputies should not view all issues from the 
standpoint of the population of their districts. And it seems to 
me that the most important thing is organizing normal 
self-government. For something significant can be done only by 
relying on people's opinion. 
  Yes, people now have retired into their shells. They are 
told 
that the time has come for competition and they must elbow their 
way through; but one cannot do that in life--mutual assistance 
is simply essential. So people must be helped to become aware of 
their interests and learn how to stand up for them.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Andreyeva: "Oversight of the `Peaceful' </F>
Atom"] 
  [Text] In the constantly increasing revelation of the 
"secrets" of our life, one sees more the very belated victory of 
common sense, rather than just another "supposed discovery." And 
although for the first time many things were spoken of without 
the stamp of secrecy at the press conference where the 
participants included the managers of all six regional districts 
of Gosatomnadzor Rossii [Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear 
and Radiation Security], as well as the deputy chairman of this 
federal department, A. M. Zhokin, all of whom came to 
Novosibirsk for the All-Russian Conference on Questions of 
Nuclear and Radiation Safety, nonetheless the secrecy was still 
apparent. 
<H5>  We Didn't Stand Behind the Price Before and We Still Don't </H5>
  Do not believe that some people behave badly just because 
they like to. Most often they behave that way for very good 
reason, a sage has claimed. But as everyone knows, wise men do 
not have all the answers. For what benefit could there be, and 
for whom, for example, from the super secrecy with which most of 
the "postal boxes" of the military-industrial complex poisoned 
the air, water, and land? But even so that sage's claim is not 
far from the truth. And it is precisely this "benefit," it 
seems, that is the root of all the secrecy whose fruits we are 
reaping today. Suffice it to recall the desire, at whatever 
cost, to report "launching by the red-letter date" and "early 
fulfillment of the construction plan." In itself the desire is 
praiseworthy. If, of course, one does not take into account that 
as a rule the money and time which were in short supply here 
were "saved" in the nature protection complexes which were 
supposed to alleviate the technogenic pressure and protect 
nature and hence people from the harmful impact of production. 
Despite all that, a brave face was put on a sorry business: We 
were truly indignant at nuclear explosions near a distant atoll 
at the edge of the world, while living almost under the wing of 
the Semipalatinsk Test Range in complete confidence of the 
purity of our sky. 
  The truth will out. There were a considerable number of 
rumors about PO Box 80, as many citizens out of habit still call 
the chemical concentrates plant. But all the same only a few of 
the workers even knew that their plant was one of the nuclear 
fuel cycle enterprises and that among other "secrets," fuel 
elements for atomic power plants were made there. The same ones 
which were supposed to replace the smoking TES's [heat and 
electric power plants] and other harmful energy sources almost 
everywhere. 
<H5>  Out of the Frying Pan Into the Fire </H5>
  But it would be more accurate to speak of the ineradicable 
force of the custom of jumping from one extreme to the other. 
And while yesterday we saw the peaceful atom as a reliable 
source of heat and light and an aid in medical work and the 
medical system, now many people see those very atomic power 
plants as nothing but monsters which threaten mankind with 
disaster. 
  The lesson of Chernobyl and Tomsk? Was a great deal of 
benefit derived from what happened? In the Siberian Region, on 
whose territory in addition to the six nuclear fuel cycle 
enterprises there are five nuclear reactors, two industrial 
reactors (in Tomsk-7 and Krasnoyarsk-26) have already been shut 
down. It seems that such a fate awaits two research reactors 
too. Three now in operation have a two-fold purpose: military 
and industrial. The reactor in Krasnoyarsk-26 provides all the 
electricity and heat to this city, while in Tomsk-7 two other 
reactors, in addition, provide one-quarter of the electricity 
and almost one-half the heat for greater Tomsk as well. 
<H5>  I Left My Grandfather and I Left My Grandmother </H5>
  In accordance with a presidential edict, the federal nuclear 
and radiation safety oversight service represented by 
Gosatomnadzor is supposed to provide monitoring of both the 
peaceful atom and the military atom. But although the deadline 
for transferring military nuclear installations to the control 
of Gosatomnadzor has already passed, the radiation safety 
department has certainly not obtained access to army secrets. 
  And all the same in accordance with existing international 
agreements, military reactors are supposed to be shut down in 
the near future. However, many of the problems with their 
continued use arise when they are switched to a peaceful 
footing. The Ministry of Fuel and Energy is already insisting on 
unloading present AES [nuclear electric power plant] capacities, 
referring to their unreliability. For example, the Balakovo AES, 
for which our chemical concentrates plant even supplies fuel 
assemblies, ended up at such an impasse. 
<H5>  Where Are the `Tailings' Supposed To Go? </H5>
  Despite the existing opinion about destroying and not 
building, shutting down nuclear production is both a complicated 
and an extremely expensive pleasure. And one of the main 
problems both for AES's being "temporarily shut down" and for 
working nuclear fuel cycle enterprises which use radioactive 
sources and products based on them is storing the radioactive 
waste. This problem is an acute one for Novosibirsk too. 
<H5>  The Chik Is Not So Black as It Is Painted </H5>
  Who has not heard of the horrors of the Chik "testing 
range," 
although a question about it brings a smile to the people who 
know the situation from other than hearsay. It seems that there 
is a rigorous plan for storing nuclear materials at the site 
where they are "registered." And each region has its own 
"tailings storage facility." And we do too. But it is located on 
the other side from the Chik. "Small stuff" is stored near the 
Chik, for the most part items which contain radioactive sources. 
The Radon Firm works on this. If one judges by the fact that 
scrap material with radioactive content from Omsk and Tomsk is 
stored here and until recently "corpses" arrived from Kazakhstan 
as well, the "registration permit" system of the Chik storage 
facility is not so very rigorously observed. As for its safety, 
according to the chief of the Siberian District of 
Gosatomnadzor, P. D. Mintyukov, the test conducted recently by a 
major commission found no traces of radioactive contamination, 
not even in the ground waters around the storage facility. 
Unlike the results of the study of nuclear objects of Russia, 
which, according to A. M. Zhokin, revealed a "multitude of 
negative aspects" in the handling of radioactive waste. The 
materials of this study are being processed, a number of 
normative documents have been prepared, and the Law on Radiation 
Safety is under study. However, bringing things up to the norm 
of course requires major capital investments. Given the present 
shortage of such things, it is not difficult to guess that the 
steps outlined will be postponed. Until better times. 
  The shortage of capital investments is an "Achilles heel" in 
the safety of our chemical concentrates plant, although it 
applies for the most part to the strength of the buildings. That 
is to say, if suddenly an airplane falls from the sky, the plant 
will not survive. Such a "surprise" does not threaten similar 
enterprises in Europe, for example. 
  As for the safety of our enterprise's personnel and the 
level 
of the technological processes, it turns out that specialists of 
Western Europe and America are working terribly hard trying to 
penetrate the secret of how we managed to reach a level which a 
similar German enterprise in Hanoi, for example, did not even 
dream of. 
<H5>  You Pick It Up and It Glows </H5>
  Time will show whether Gosatomnadzor and its inspection 
offices manage to protect our life from their radioactive ward, 
which has convincingly demonstrated its far from peaceful 
disposition. But perhaps the "radioactive scoundrel" in our city 
played the meanest joke on the so-called pilferer of vegetables. 
In recent years Berezovgeologiya [Berezov Geology] specialists 
have identified about 200 spots with radioactive contamination 
in the city. Such "points" shone most often in Kalininskiy 
Rayon. Radioactive anomalies were registered in dacha plots, 
private sector gardens, and apartments whose owners got into the 
habit of picking up everything that was left untended. A great 
deal of material was poorly stored in "PO Box" 80 too. Put to 
work by zealous masters, it glowed in the new place as well. But 
it glowed in an evil way. 
  But if the "demon beguiled" the pilferers out of ignorance, 
then how can one explain the cases where waste from this 
"closed" enterprise was used for fill on roadbeds, for fix up 
work in residential zones, and even on the grounds of children's 
institutions? By this same ignorance, the natural result of 
secrecy, or near-criminal carelessness? And the presence in 
almost half of the city's schools of items with a radioactive 
content--wasn't that really the same cause and effect series? 
<H5>  We Are All Under the Same Atom </H5>
  The very same misfortunes are characteristic of all regions 
and cities of Russia. According to the estimate of the 
specialists of the St. Petersburg Scientific Research Institute 
of Radiation Hygiene of the Ministry of Health Care of Russia, 
each person in our country on the average receives 0.123 rems 
from medical radiation (X-ray examination, fluorography, and the 
like) and 0.293 rems from the natural background. Overall that 
gives an exposure over 70 years which is almost 300 times 
greater than the radiation from the accident at the Chernobyl 
AES. 
  The primary problems linked to radioactive contamination are 
radiation disease and oncological diseases. The rate of the 
latter is higher in our city than the average for Russia, and 
according to an evaluation by the AGIZ-Health Group of the city 
sanitary-epidemiological oversight center headed by I. F. 
Mingazov, it is on the upswing. But benzapyrine, soot, and 
metals are also carcinogenic. And even the smallest dose of 
radiation against the background of high chemical pollution 
increases its danger many times over. But if the city's 
excessive natural radiation background because of its granite 
"foundation" is taken into account, they should have been more 
careful, as the satirist used to say, not only with radioactive 
contamination but with other discharges and emissions as well. 
Without that, no Gosatomnadzor will help us.

<F P=106> [Interview, under the rubric "The Republic of Khakassiya," </F>
with Vladimir Nikolayevich Shtygashev, chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet of Khakassiya, conducted by Natalya Pachegina; time and 
place not given] 
  [Text] Vladimir Shtygashev, the chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet of Khakassiya, which has been awarded two orders and in 
July 1991 was transformed from the Khakass Autonomous Oblast 
which was part of Krasnoyarsk Kray into a republic, is a subject 
of the Russian Federation. And 4 months after the October events 
in Moscow he continues to believe that "you cannot build a just 
society on an unjust action." What is the basis of the obstinacy 
of the republic, which did not hold a referendum on the draft 
Russian Constitution on 12 December? Is it remoteness from 
Moscow or the natural obstinacy of the Khakass Shtygashev (on 
principle he refused to participate in the elections to the RF 
Federal Assembly)? 
  [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, your name, along with the 
name of the president of Kalmykiya, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, has been 
among those which are considered untrustworthy for some time. Do 
you somehow sense a special attitude on Moscow's part toward the 
republic and toward you in particular? 
  [Shtygashev] Do you know the nasty way all this is being 
handled now? In medieval times the battle was a forthright one, 
but today the tactics have changed; aloud they say that yes, the 
republic must be supported, but when credits are distributed and 
in tax policy, in particular deductions into the federal budget, 
it turns out that the people are being "punished." We are 
opposing the discriminatory measures to the extent we can by 
adopting decisions that contradict them in our government, but 
the "law of the telephone" remains an all-powerful means for 
influencing the unruly. Blackmail is used. Soon after the 
October events, a representative of the supreme power visited 
the republic and made us understand that the republic could only 
benefit from showing loyalty, although we understand very well 
that we will not be given anything more than is proper. 
  I feel uncomfortable in Moscow; although I do not hear any 
direct attacks against me, I sense the hostility with every cell 
of my body. There are now two feelings fighting within me: on 
the one hand to leave and abandon everything so that at least in 
my republic there is no antipathy toward me, and on the other, I 
always remember that there is nowhere for me to go from here, I 
will be buried in this land. Can I leave the people at this time? 
  [Pachegina] I suspect that your impressions as an eyewitness 
of the October Moscow events were unlikely to have been 
solicited. 
  [Shtygashev] Yes, I would like to share them. Even now I 
consider Ruslan Khasbulatov a great patriot of Russia. 
Especially since the president and Chernomyrdin are now saying 
that Khasbulatov fought for 2 years. Now they are even assuring 
Clinton that they intend to build a socially oriented economy. 
But back then, Khasbulatov, not any kind of prophet but simply 
knowing the sentiments of the country's people well, expressed 
their interests. 
  It is painful for me to remember October. Even now I insist 
that the future cannot be built on an unjust action. And the 
edict and all the events which followed it, including the 
elections to the Council of the Federation, are all illegal and 
unconstitutional. And let them prove to me that the revolution 
being conducted by Yeltsin is justified and that the reforms are 
unrealizable without these upheavals. 
  I have made up my mind, but people, well they are different, 
and each one has to make up his mind for himself. At the meeting 
of the Council of the Federation, I asked Ilyumzhinov: so you 
are going to vote for Shumeyko? And he gestured helplessly and 
said: they promised to reconstruct the airport in Elista. That's 
your answer. 
  [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, how did it come to be 
that 
you were on the side of the defenders of the White House but 
ended up outside its walls? 
  [Shtygashev] I had already left for the Siberian conference, 
and when I returned to Moscow the "assault" was underway. But on 
the 4th [October] I was a witness to the disgraceful vote in the 
government. Even now I am ashamed to remember it. Chernomyrdin 
proposed to all the representatives of the republics to adopt 
some kind of resolution on the "communist-fascist forces which 
had ensconced themselves in the White House" there. Forty people 
raised their hands. Chernomyrdin asked, anyone opposed perhaps? 
I was the first to stand up. About 40 people supported me. The 
others sat there and put their heads in their hands, and some 
closed their eyes. Perhaps they were ashamed or perhaps they 
were cowards. It was a nightmare. 
  I became a parliamentarian that way. At the Constitutional 
Court, 60-70 people gathered in Zorkin's office. Some little 
priest from Aleksiy ran in. I said to him: Are you going with us 
to stop the blood? He said: Yes, yes, of course. I removed the 
small white silk blind from the window of the Constitutional 
Court. Only eight of these representatives of the republics 
went. Ilyumzhinov's Lincoln and a Volvo started to the White 
House. All the cordons, including the third one, under the 
bridge, galloped by, and our motorcade was at a firing position. 
There was filthy language--I never heard such a thing. We were 
ordered, the soldiers told us, to maintain heavy fire, and you, 
get over there, to the wall. 
  [Pachegina] Excuse me, but was there return fire from the 
White House? 
  [Shtygashev] There was no return fire, everything was quiet 
from that side. Listen further. The commandant of this sector 
allowed Aushev and Ilyumzhinov into the White House. After 
holding me at gunpoint for 20 minutes, they allowed me to go to 
the foot of a stairway where a field hospital had been set up. I 
managed to get close to our cars. Then Aushev and Ilyumzhinov 
came out of the White House with a white flag. And at that 
moment OMON [Special Militia Detachment] withdrew its cordon and 
the whole crowd of 300 people raced toward us. They fired 
pistols point-blank and tried to tip over the cars. Ilyumzhinov 
was still arguing when the guard took him and literally threw 
him into the car. The Kalmyk fellows threw Aushev and me in 
there too at one stroke. People were firing at us and throwing 
rails and stones. We finally escaped. The Lincoln, of course, is 
a powerful car and held out. 
  [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, the government which 
adopted that resolution remains almost the same. 
  [Shtygashev] I consider myself a member of the Russian 
intelligentsia, and I cannot reconcile myself to the idea that 
not one of them refused to participate in the shameful business 
and not one of them repented. 
  [Pachegina] Apparently, then, you do not believe in the 
viability of the Council of the Federation or the State Duma? 
  [Shtygashev] There is an auction going on in the Council of 
the Federation. I do not think that such methods can be used to 
achieve consensus. Although I believe that the Council of the 
Federation can play a positive role in pacifying the country. 
But in the State Duma the viewpoints of politicians who have 
assembled there are in such opposition that counting on 
consensus is altogether naive. The only thing that can save us 
is a unified surge of emotion in the name of Russia, but once 
again the make-up of these organs eliminates any illusions. 
  [Pachegina] Well, is there anyone in Moscow to whom you 
would 
entrust the helm of the Russian state? 
  [Shtygashev] The only person is perhaps Yuriy Skokov. A 
statesman. And absolutely decent. 
  [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, your obstinacy did not 
come out of nowhere. You must have very strong support to allow 
yourself to dare to oppose Moscow. 
  [Shtygashev] You know, without false modesty I can say that 
if I ran for the Federal Assembly of Russia, I think I would do 
well. I am doing everything that I can in my post, and I am not 
ashamed to look into the eyes of the people of Khakassiya. 
Moreover, I really do have strong support, as you said. The 
republic is sixth in the Federation in terms of production of 
output. We are fully self-supporting in agricultural products. 
So the economic slump has had a very negligible effect on the 
republic. Fortunately, we do not have interethnic conflicts. Our 
indicators on privatization of enterprises and the housing fund 
are almost the highest in the country, although I am called a 
conservative.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina, under the rubric "Republic of </F>
Khakassiya": "The Region of Untouched Monuments Lives Without a 
President or a Constitution"] 
  [Text] Perhaps the unevenness of the landscape along the 
4,218 kilometers which separate the republic's capital of Abakan 
from the center of the Federation is an insurmountable obstacle 
to the democratic "impulses" coming from Moscow, or perhaps the 
600,000 people of Khakassiya, located peacefully at the foot of 
the Sayans, are simply not inclined to abrupt movements; but the 
uniqueness of the life of Khakassiya is so marked that it forces 
one to think of the price the country paid for the right to be 
called democratic. The external differences with Moscow are 
manifested not only in the excellent quality of the roads (and, 
as Viktor Bryuzgin, press secretary of the chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet of Khakassiya, assures us, there is not a rayon 
center in the republic where asphalt has not been laid) and in 
the yardkeepers who wake people in the morning with the scraping 
of their shovels, and not only in the lack of paupers and 
beggars on streets with the intact names of Lenin, Sverdlov, and 
Kirov, but even, to judge by municipal transport, in the 
citizens' solid custom of going "into work." It is striking here 
that they are not "doing battle" with their monuments: monuments 
to Lenin and Kirov and young heroes and other Soviet monumental 
sculpture continue to stand on prospects of the same name, only 
it is difficult to tell because there is so much snow. Only a 
two-sided sign on a building indicating the selection in the 
chic store of a local entrepreneur, which was apparently made 
for Anglo-Saxons and those Khakass who do not read Russian 
("vegetables" in English), plus the Intim Store (100 rubles [R] 
to look around), where the population which is not having sex is 
offered various "appliances," illustrate the difficulty of the 
"path of democratic transformations in the Russian expanses." 
  But the most pleasant feelings are aroused by those citizens 
whose faces develop such deep creases on their foreheads when 
asked to give the names of the republic's leaders (I had to 
distract them from the television where Prostomariya was on); 
one begins to understand that despite all the seeming 
"moderation" of the rhythm of its life, it is closer than all 
the other subjects of the Federation to the ideal of a 
democratic society in which, it seems, an inhabitant is so free 
that he does not burden himself with the need to follow 
political life. Here, following their chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet, Vladimir Shtygashev, active rejection of the "moral 
principles of capitalism" is underway among the population: only 
in one place in Abakan, on Prospect Lenin, has a "street market" 
so familiar to a Muscovite developed, but the dealing is being 
done by visitors. When one of Khakassiya's mines was being 
privatized, Shtygashev related, one of the former warehouse 
chiefs tried to make himself its boss; they explained to him 
with Siberian conviction that "it would be difficult." But 
overall the formation of joint stock companies from state 
enterprises oriented for the most part to producing finished 
output is perhaps going more slowly than Moscow would like, but 
then, as V. Shtygashev believes, more reliably. In terms of 
privatization of the republic's housing fund, in that same 
Shtygashev's opinion, it is almost the leader in the Federation. 
The 61,900 square kilometer area of Khakassiya makes it possible 
to fully satisfy the people's attraction to the land--the 
population has been allocated 120,000 plots, and the citizens' 
"whims" in this regard are for the most part related to the 
impossibility of reaching the personal plots by bus (!). 
  The population's steady political sympathies and antipathies 
also strikingly distinguish Khakassiya from the other regions of 
Russia. The residents of the republic do not regard the reformer 
of contemporary times Gaydar with favor, for the most part 
because he has a direct relationship with the "writer and 
fighter" Golikov. Here even the ringing literary pseudonym of 
the author of the "Blue Cup" is explained like this: translated 
from the Mongolian into the Khakass language, the "horseman 
galloping forward" sounds like "khay dar?"--"where is he?" This 
question was used as an exchange among the peasants who hid the 
"gang" of a certain local enemy of Soviet power, Solovyev, for 
whom the young and ambitious Golikov conducted a long and bloody 
hunt. The Khakass villages which were slaughtered at the time by 
the grandfather in this way have a damaging effect on the 
grandson's reputation. Regarding feelings about the president of 
the country, whom they do know, of course, there is a directly 
proportional relationship with the place of work and the wages 
of the local voter. Thus, the 1,200 associates of the gigantic 
Sayano-Shushenskiy Hydroelectric Plant, who upon receiving their 
wages sign a promise not to divulge them, unanimously supported 
Yeltsin in the April referendum, while another part of the 
republic's electorate refrained from expressing its delight. The 
vote on the draft of the new Russian Constitution in December 
had a similar effect, which, it is true, has not yet resulted in 
any legal sanctions against Khakassiya. The republic, which has 
unhurriedly responded to Moscow's political and economic 
innovations, still does not have its own constitution or 
president. Khakassiya was in no hurry with the former, the 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Khakassiya 
said, because it was intending to coordinate it with the 
all-Russian one. But the present draft of the Russian one fails 
to suit not only the population which boycotted it on 12 
December, but even the legislators of Khakassiya, to whom it 
seems that the country's Fundamental Law lacks obligations to 
the peoples of Russia. Their own constitution, Shtygashev 
believes, must look like a declaration of rights, powers, and 
certainly obligations of the Republic of Khakassiya to the 
Federation and its own people. 
  The idea of electing the president of the republic, which, 
incidentally, the Supreme Soviet of Khakassiya regards without 
any special enthusiasm, nonetheless occupies the minds of the 
masters of this land. The Khakass, who make up only 11.8 percent 
(about 63,000 people) of the entire population, passionately 
want this, although there is a very slim probability that no 
worthy candidates for this post will be found among the 80 
percent of the population that is Russian. The present chairman 
of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Khakassiya, Vladimir 
Shtygashev, in contrast, is certain that his prestige is quite 
high. And, it seems, he has reason to think so. The politics of 
active opposition by the republic's leaders to the tradition of 
the center's "colonial" attitude toward Southern Siberia finds 
support here among the Khakass and Russian population. Other 
ethnic groups who became Siberians against their 
will--Ukrainians, Germans, Poles, and Finns--also adhere to the 
Siberian way of life. There are virtually no compact 
mononational settlements in the republic; only in Shirinskiy 
Rayon in Khakassiya are there several streets where German 
families live in an orderly fashion. The nationality policy of 
the republic's leadership is simple and uncomplicated--those 
very wartime-labor Germans receive pensions from the republic. 
Every veteran received a medal for labor during the war, noted 
Andrey Vagner, founder of the republic Russian-German Society 
"Vidergeburt" (who completely repudiated any kinship with 
Hitler's beloved composer, the creator of "Die Nibelungen"). 
German youth, it is true, are leaving, said Vagner, and because 
they do not live close together, the Germans of Khakassiya are 
unable to teach their children the language. 
  The religious diversity of the population is also to a 
considerable degree the result of the migration of the followers 
of certain doctrines--Old Believers, Evangelical Baptists, 
Seventh Day Adventists, and Jehovah's Witnesses--to Southern 
Siberia, to get away from the official Russian Orthodox church. 
Muslims, Catholics, and Lutherans are few in number. 
Christianity, introduced by missionaries from Russian 200-300 
years ago parallel to the development of the Siberian lands, 
even now maintains a large body of believers, including among 
the Khakass. 
  Social instability in Khakassiya comes for the most part 
from 
a "special" category of citizens who were brought to the 
republic 20-30 years ago as a result of the "cleansing" of the 
large cities of Russia and the USSR. As people say here, they 
are the ones who differ from the locals with some of their 
absurd demands, for example to raise wages, or they try to blow 
up monuments, as happened in the only coal town where Lenin did 
not withstand the might of the enraged proletariat.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "Aushev Will Remain </F>
President, Under the Condition Moscow Is Flexible"] 
  [Text] Upon the expiration of the deadline for the 
nomination of candidates to the post of president of the 
republic, it was learned that the short list of contenders 
lacked the name of the current president of Ingushetia--Ruslan 
Aushev. And if one pays attention to the circumstance that all 
the other contenders, who are less well-known in Russia (for 
example, the republic's assistant procurator general, 
Karimsultan Kokorokhoyev, or the former sovkhoz director Magomed 
Mankiyev, who gathered 20,000 voter signatures each during the 
election campaign), and in Nazran they are perceived more as 
"extras," then Aushev's gesture on the eve of the elections to 
the republic parliament and the voting on the construction of 
the Republic of Ingushetia was most likely not meant for the 
Ingush people, who are bravely risking being left without a 
shepherd, at all, but for Moscow. The more so since it is 
offering plenty of occasion for such "gesticulation": As far as 
we know Aushev's conditions--when speaking in favor of 
unwavering implementation of the president's December edict on 
returning refugees and forced resettlers from Prigorodnyy Rayon 
to North Ossetia and demanding in this connection an immediate 
replacement of the head of the temporary administration on the 
territories of the Republic of South Ossetia and the Republic of 
Ingushetia, Vladimir Lozovoy--are still unsatisfactory. Just as, 
incidentally, a year hence a zero result also characterizes the 
process of the return of the Ingush refugees to North Ossetia, 
which created a wave of expectations regarding General Aushev's 
election as president of Ingushetia. 
  Aushev's pre-election "coquetry" was thus provoked. And it 
would seem that many a president could envy Aushev: Not all of 
them can, like the Ingush leader, boast of such a reliable 
"rear" made up of their citizens. And although the president is 
saying these days that the republic leaders, including himself, 
are "figures of the transitional period," and Ingushetia needs 
new politicians who can adapt to new conditions, it should have 
dawned on Moscow before all others (including Nazran) that the 
"familiar" Aushev is more convenient than any "new adapted 
politician," trying with the enthusiasm of a beginner to solve 
the problems of the conflict zone. If even now it is not at all 
simple to apply "federal sanctions" against one Aushev has 
accused of sabotaging the president's edict--President of South 
Ossetia Galazov--the head of the temporary administration could 
very well become "small change," the more so since the loyalty 
and stability of Ingushetia regulated by Aushev is worth 
something. 
  According to information from Nazran, in spite of the 
absence 
of Aushev's name on the list of contenders for the post of 
president, the gathering of signatures for him is continuing 
(about 100,000 have already been gathered), and throughout the 
republic--they said in the permanent mission of the Republic of 
Ingushetia in Moscow--there are to be rallies at which only one 
name will be on Ingush lips--Aushev.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "The Ranks of the </F>
Anti-Dudayev Opposition Are Thinning, and the Authorities Are 
Conducting a Census"] 
  [Text] During the day of 9 February, reported the chief of 
the Department of State Security of Chechnya, Sultan 
Geliskhanov, one of the leaders of the anti-Dudayev opposition 
was arrested in Groznyy--a former leader of the national 
security committee of the parliament of the Republic of Chechnya 
and now commander of opposition troop units, Major General 
Ibragim Suleymenov. While attempting to organize resistance to 
the representative of power, Geliskhanov related, five of 
Suleymenov's guards were disarmed along with him. And on that 
same day, all six of them were taken to the Groznyy 
investigative detention facility, where Suleymenov, representing 
the republic procurator general, Sheripova, was accused of 
"leading an illegal armed grouping on the territory of Chechnya." 
  A couple of days before his arrest, as we know from the 
press 
service representative under the Military Council of Field 
Commanders of the Chechen Republic, Zambek Aliyev, Ibragim 
Suleymenov had advanced a number of demands for the current 
republic leaders, among which the first and most categorical was 
for the retirement of President Dudayev and the application 
against him of proceedings of the shariat or civil (the 
accused's choice) court. Another condition of the former Chechen 
parliamentarian was the return and distribution among the 
republic's population of the monetary funds (about a billion 
dollars) kept in foreign bank accounts and belonging, the 
accused thinks, to the people of Chechnya. 
  Suleymenov is known to the authorities also from the events 
of 16 December in Groznyy, when he, along with other field 
commanders of the opposition armed forces, appeared in front of 
the presidential palace and delivered an ultimatum, the edited 
version of which differed considerably from the February 
demands. During those days, official Groznyy gave the appearance 
that it fully understood the patriotic feelings of the "youth" 
(with whom the 45-year-old Suleymenov was included) who were 
disturbed by the state of affairs in the republic. To a question 
from a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent to the chief of the 
Department of the Press and Information of the Chechen Republic, 
Movladi Udugov, as to why the accusation of "leadership of 
illegal armed formations" was leveled against only one of the 
so-called "field commanders" who were freely handling the armed 
group (according to unofficial information, there are more than 
a hundred of these "private" militarized formations in the 
republic), the answer was that other such, for example, as 
Shamil Basayev or Ruslan Gelayev, who fought at the Abkhazian 
front in a special regiment under the president of Chechnya and 
were "discovered" on 16 December in Suleymenov's company, have 
quite legitimate grounds for being called commanders, since they 
serve in the presidential regiment, which today the authorities 
have put to work guarding facilities of the petroleum industry 
complex. 
  A highly placed bureaucrat categorically denied the 
information from the opposition press service regarding the 
training maneuvers of the armed opposition begun in N rayon in 
Chechnya on 4 February. It is Udugov's conviction that maneuvers 
as such cannot take place, since the republic army and Ministry 
of Internal Affairs are monitoring the situation, and 
participation of combat helicopters in maneuvers, as the press 
service under the Military Council of Field Commanders reported, 
could not go unnoticed. At the same time, the Security Service 
of Chechnya has almost no doubt that arms are being delivered to 
Suleymenov and "his ilk" from the arsenals of Russia. The chief 
of the Department of Press and Information of the Chechen 
Republic, who is unfamiliar with the political situation of the 
arrested commander, also denied the opposition's reproaches for 
the organization by official Groznyy of a "slanderous campaign" 
against Suleymenov which took place in republic mass media. 
Suleymenov, the opposing side related in return, has nothing to 
do with drug trafficking, which President Dudayev's supporters 
are trying to pin on him, and he certainly is not known for 
pro-Russian or pro-communist sympathies. The opposition, having 
lost in Suleymenov one of the significant opponents to Dudayev's 
regime, made a statement from which it can be clearly seen that 
"twists" of the future fate of the president of Chechnya will be 
determined by the measure of his prudence. 
  Moreover, on 10 February there began a census of the 
population in the republic, whose purpose was to clarify "how 
many Chechens live on earth" (Udugov). To do this, he said, 
emissaries from Groznyy traveled to all continents of the globe. 
But in the republic, M. Udugov noted, the census involves not 
only Chechens but also citizens of other nationalities. 
According to the observation of specialists of Chechnya, the 
number of these people decreases by a factor of 1.5 to two with 
each succeeding census, and the current authorities of Chechnya 
intend to put an end to this vicious tendency. 
  To this end, Udugov explained, 23 February--the day of the 
50th anniversary of the deportation of the Chechen people--will 
be declared not a day of mourning but a nationwide celebration 
of rebirth. The 23d will coincide with the opening in Groznyy of 
a memorial complex composed of the tombstones defiled during the 
years of Soviet power in Chechnya. On that same day there will 
be a demonstration of the new military uniform of the Chechen 
Army, and the possibility of a festive military parade cannot be 
ruled out. 
  The unification of the Chechens and other peoples of the 
Northern Caucasus was the subject of a conference in Istanbul 
(Turkey) in which representatives of Chechnya participated as 
well. Participants in the meeting, who were protected by the 
Turkish authorities (among those present were the chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet of Dagestan, the vice president of Kalmykia, 
the heads of the Cherkess and Chechen community, and according 
to certain information, a representative from Georgia also 
visited Turkey as an observer) opened in Istanbul a "Caucasian 
Mission" whose elected president is a citizen of the Chechen 
Republic, the businessman Akhmet Khildekharoyev, who is the 
official representative of Chechnya in Turkey. The purpose of 
the meeting, in Udugov's words, was to strengthen the ties of 
the Caucasian peoples of Russia and the republics of 
Transcaucasia with Turkey.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Yemuzov, by Z. Malbakhova: "A. Yemuzov: </F>
There Is No Alternative to Goodneighborliness, Friendship, and 
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] In April of last year, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs was created in Kabardino-Balkaria. The formation of that 
foreign-policy department was not only a step in the development 
of the republic's state system, but also a vital necessity that 
was dictated by the new political realities. The role and 
importance of the ministry are difficult to overevaluate. It has 
been given the functions of using diplomatic and political means 
to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, security, 
inviolability of the republic's borders, and its political and 
economic-trade and other interests, both within the framework of 
the Russian Federation and on the international scene, and of 
creating favorable conditions for carrying out the reforms that 
the nation needs. 
  We have asked A. G. Yemuzov, KBR [Kabardino-Balkaria 
Republic] minister of foreign affairs, to discuss the 
high-priority trends in the work performed by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic, its affairs 
and plans, and to answer a number of other questions. 
  [Yemuzov] Taking into consideration the political situation 
that has been created in the Caucasus, the KBR MID [Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs] considers that one of its most important tasks 
is the creation of a "goodneighborliness zone" around 
Kabardino-Balkaria. With this purpose, Treaties of friendship 
and goodneighborliness have been signed with the Republic of 
Adygey, the Karachayevo-Cherkess Republic, Stavropol Kray, the 
Republic of Dagestan, and the Republic of Kalmykia -- Khalmg 
Tangch. Treaties with Krasnodar Kray and Rostov Oblast have been 
prepared and coordinated. In order to restore the economic and 
cultural relations with subjects of the Russian Federation, a 
Treaty has been signed with Yaroslavl Oblast, and one with Perm 
Oblast has been extended. Treaties with the Chuvash Republic and 
with Tambov and Donetsk oblasts are being prepared for signing. 
Close contact is being maintained with Abkhazia, including 
contact along the diplomatic channel -- through the permanent 
representative of that republic in KBR. 
  Any understanding is always taking the first steps toward 
cooperation. The further development of relations depends on 
many factors. But what is required of us is that the initial 
ties are well thought-out and have the potential for growth. If 
one speaks about concretizing the content of the treaties, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has rendered assistance in 
concluding an agreement among Adygey, Kabardino-Balkaria, and 
Karachayevo-Chekesia concerning cooperation in training 
specialists with higher education, and the Treaty of cooperation 
between the KBR and Adygey ministries of the press and 
information in creating a single information space. 
  [Malbakhova] Do you see any difference between politics and 
diplomacy? 
  [Yemuzov] I would not oppose them to one another, since a 
country's foreign policy is a continuation of its domestic 
policy. Politics and diplomacy are two sides of the same coin. 
Ideally, any politician must be a diplomat, and vice versa. If 
that is not so, then large mistakes can occur in the work being 
performed by both of them. 
  [Malbakhova] What role has your ministry been called upon to 
play in the matter of restoring foreign-economic ties? 
  [Yemuzov] At the present time the KBR Committee on 
Foreign-Economic Ties is working on these problems. But, 
inasmuch as the question has already been raised, I can reply. 
  For diplomacy, the normal role is that of an icebreaker that 
is opening up a sea path in the shoreless ocean of world 
business. One of the basic tasks assigned to our ministry 
consists in creating the best conditions for the work of the 
entrepreneur with a foreign partner. However, the misfortune -- 
but not the blame -- of the subjects of the Russian Federation 
consists in the fact that all the foreign-economic activity used 
to be centralized and used to be carried out by way of Moscow. 
As a result of this policy, the outlying areas lack various 
capabilities, experience, and a sense of business organization. 
Today our initiative finds support and understanding in Moscow 
--it is precisely here that one can see the pledge of success 
and stability in the business and other spheres. 
  [Malbakhova] Could you discuss the path along which our 
republic should proceed in restoring foreign-economic relations? 
What can we offer our foreign partners? 
  [Yemuzov] When restoring business relations it is necessary 
to act not spontaneously, but in a "normal sequence," that is, 
in accordance with the traditional scheme that is well known in 
international practice -- "trade-- tourism -- investments." 
  In this question it is not only our republic, but all of 
Russia, that is displaying impatience, wanting to begin "at the 
end" --with investments. Actually, the normal sequence probably 
would not be successful. If only because we are facing an 
abnormal situation. Even in order to begin to develop trade and 
tourism seriously, it is necessary to have investments in a 
system of hotels, sanitoriums, rest homes, tourist centers, 
transportation, communications, supporting production entities, 
etc. Consequently, we could propose to our foreign partners that 
they take out long-term leases for some of our sanitoriums and 
recreational centers, and that we operate others jointly. In 
both instances it would be on mutually advantageous terms. We 
could propose to our foreign partners the output from a number 
of our industrial enterprises, for example, the Tyrnyauz 
Combine, the diamond cutting-tool plant, the synthetic leather 
combine, as well as everything that nature has lavishly bestowed 
on us -- the therapeutic factors of our health resort. 
  [Malbakhova] You are a doctor of sciences and a professor, 
you have been in many countries, and you have a large amount of 
work experience abroad. Last year, nevertheless, you attended 
classes in Moscow. Could you discuss that? 
  [Yemuzov] It's never too late for anyone to get an 
education. 
Therefore, actually, in 1993 I took special training at the 
one-year refresher courses for managerial diplomatic cadres at 
the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, where the subjects taught were questions of 
international law, diplomatic protocol, the concept of the 
Russian Federation's foreign policy, the philosophy of politics 
and diplomacy, foreign languages, and other disciplines. I 
completed the courses three months ahead of time, with 
distinction. 
  [Malbakhova] What are the realistic possibilities that the 
KBR will appear on the world scene? 
  [Yemuzov] Last year the KBR Ministry of Foreign Affairs did 
a 
definite amount of work to establish relations and strengthen 
the existing ones with the distant foreign countries and their 
subjects. In March 1993 a KBR delegation made an official visit 
to the Turkish Republic. The delegation was received by Minister 
of Foreign Affairs (Hikmet Cetin). He was given a message from 
KBR President V. M. Kokov to the President of the Turkish 
Republic. In the course of the visit, Agreements were signed -- 
between the Union of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and 
Exchanges of Turkey, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, and the 
KBR. There were meetings with activists from associations of 
people of Cherkess nationality in Ankara and Istanbul. 
  As a result of the preliminary negotiations between the 
Kabardino-Balkaria government and the Alberta (Canada) 
commissioner for culture and tourism, a Treaty of friendship and 
cooperation was signed. Agreements concerning the formation of 
sister cities Nalchik and Kaiseri (Turkey), as well as a Treaty 
of friendship and cooperation between them, were signed. 
  Ministry employees were part of delegations that went to 
Turkey, Syria, and Jordan to carry out work to expand ties in 
the area of economics, culture, and education. Meetings were 
held with a delegation of the International Islamic "Salvation" 
organization from Saudi Arabia, headed by Imam Abdul-Hamid Jafar 
Dagestani. Three meetings were held with secretaries of the 
American Embassy and embassy employees. We were visited by a 
French delegation from the French Ministry of Defense, workers 
from the Israeli Embassy, and a plenipotentiary from the 
"Sokhnut" organization in the North Caucasus, as well as the 
commissioner for culture and tourism from the province of 
Alberta, Canada. 
  Assistance was provided in the creation of six 
commercial-production firms by compatriots. As a result, 
equipment with a total value of more than $200,000 (U.S.) was 
shipped into the republic. 
  We feel that there is no alternative to goodneighborliness, 
friendship, and cooperation. Otherwise we shall not succeed in 
getting out of the crisis and guaranteeing the normal 
socioeconomic development of our republic. Therefore we shall 
continue to increase the work in this area. 
  [Malbakhova] So far as we know, the KBR Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs engages in problems of repatriating our compatriots. 
What do you consider to be the chief factor in that work? 
  [Yemuzov] In order to render realistic assistance to 
compatriots who are returning to their homeland, information 
pertaining to the restoration or acquisition of citizenship has 
been systematized. That is one of the important factors in our 
work, since it is precisely in this matter that difficulties 
have arisen. Our ministry prepared 285 findings at the OVIR 
[Visa and Registration Department] of the KBR Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs to provide permits for residency in the 
republic; received more than 150 foreign citizens with various 
questions; and legalized 69 documents. The Commission on 
Questions of Citizenship, under the republic's President, 
considered 104 appropriate cases. That means that the fates of 
those individuals were determined. 
  [Malbakhova] Could you discuss briefly the basic areas of 
your work during the new year? 
  [Yemuzov] If we are to speak about the program for our work 
during the current year, it is extremely broad. I shall not 
enumerate the measures that have been planned. That would take 
up too much newspaper space. We shall continue the work of 
restoring and strengthening the traditional relations of 
goodneighborliness, friendship, and cooperation with the peoples 
of the North Caucasus and the other regions of Russia. We are 
taking specific steps to establish new ties and to strengthen 
the already existing ones with the nearby and distant foreign 
countries, and have planned the preparation and carrying out of 
political actions aimed at resolving conflicts and moot 
questions and at stabilizing the sociopolitical situation in our 
region. 
  We intend to direct special attention to analytical work, to 
studying the domestic political situation in KBR, and to the 
placement of forces in the region. Our recommendations to the 
republic government will be formulated on that basis. 
  In a word, the main task of the KBR Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs is the protection of the republic's national interests 
by diplomatic means and methods.

<F P=106> Article by Vladimir Gubarev: "Dagestan; `Dead Season' in the </F>
Republic"] 
  [Text] Dagestan beats everyone in Russia in the 
number of proceedings instituted under Article 66--"terror"--of 
the Criminal Code. The sum total in the last two years was more 
than 50 terrorist acts. 
  Daring crimes are committed in Dagestan frequently, asserts 
Colonel of Justice Gamid Dzharlayev, chief of the investigative 
directorate of the former MB RD [Ministry of Security of the 
Republic of Dagestan]. But attempts on the lives of prominent 
figures--Magomed Suleymanov, a doctor; Abdurazak Mirzabekov, the 
chairman of the Council of Ministers; Said Armirov, his deputy; 
Gadiz Gadzhiyev, a member of the Constitutional Court; and the 
murder of Toturbiy Toturbiyev, the chief of Glavdagenstroy, and 
Arsen Bayramov and Bagautdin Gadzhiyev, candidates for the 
Federal Assembly--are another matter. I connect these crimes to 
the contradictions in the upper echelons of authority. 
<H5>  Selection of Targets </H5>
  Bagautdin Gadzhiyev was shot with an assault rifle in 
Makhachkala on the eve of the elections. Toturbiy Toturbiyev was 
brutally knifed in a room of the Hotel Moscow in the capital. 
  Arsen Bayramov, a Lezgin and a candidate for the Federal 
Assembly, was also shot on the eve of the elections. The 
circumstances of the death of his presumed murderer are very 
questionable. He was arrested quickly, but, according to the 
official version, he blew himself up with a grenade. What is 
most curious is that he was able to contrive to do this, if you 
believe the militia, sitting in a motor vehicle between two 
employees of the law enforcement organs. In addition, he was the 
only one to suffer in the motor vehicle. 
  Vasiliy Baronchuk, the deputy chairman of the presidium of 
the Democratic Dagestan movement, himself a militia worker in 
the past, thinks that these crimes are doomed to remain unsolved. 
  The KGB was notified of the preparation of the first attempt 
on Bagautdin Gadzhiyev, then former minister of trade of the 
republic, but it did nothing to prevent it. Five persons, 
including Gadzhiyev, sustained injuries in a grenade explosion. 
These and other terrorist acts were prepared professionally. 
Their exposure could shed light on corruption in the higher 
echelons. 
<H5>  When the Upper Echelons Cannot Share the Spoils </H5>
  "Even a simple road transport accident under conditions in 
the Caucasus can be raised to the level of a national conflict," 
says Valeriy Beyev, the first deputy minister of Internal 
Affairs of the Republic of Dagestan. "I am not an advocate of 
emotional estimates, but in a majority of these cases we also 
examine the political version of the murders. In the final 
analysis, just what is authority? It is money, it is 
positions...." 
  In 1992-1993, Dagestan received federal credits of more than 
50 billion rubles [R] for the development of farming and 
agriculture. They were distributed by the Supreme Soviet and the 
Council of Ministers. Practically the entire leadership of the 
republic had a bearing on this. As a result, the money went to 
commercial structures--for the purchase of wine-vodka articles 
and imported commodities. 
  The billions in credits that came from Moscow went to firms 
that did not exist in nature. In the Khasavyurtovskiy branch of 
the Agricultural Bank alone the negative balance was R30 
billion. The secret of secrets in Dagestan is the credit chart. 
  "As for the connection between the recent murders and the 
distribution of credits, there is a lot that is not clear here," 
asserts Valeriy Beyev. "What is bad is that even when we know of 
the improper use of these credits, it is difficult to apply 
sanctions. After all, there is no case of theft--the credit is 
returned, and it is practically impossible to prove bribery. 
Even when someone is caught red-handed, charges of provocation 
can be made in court, and then the entire foundation of proof 
breaks down." 
<H5>  Witnesses Want To Live, the Victims--To Get Revenge </H5>
  The problem of proof is also aggravated by the fact that 
witnesses fear for their fate, but a mechanism for their 
protection is lacking. Today, not one legislative act has been 
adopted for the protection of a victim, a witness, or a worker 
in law enforcement organs. 
  As a result of quick and effective measures, the MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] in 1993 in Dagestan eliminated 22 
armed groups that were engaged in plundering and highway 
robberies. During the arrest of the latest band of this kind, 
consisting of five persons, two assault rifles, three pistols, 
and 14 hand grenades were confiscated. Both the local production 
of arms as well as the transit trade is developing--the 
proximity of the belligerent territories is having an effect. 
But with respect to peaceful Chechnya, assault rifles can be 
bought openly in the market two kilometers from the border.

murdered in the past year was about 500 persons.

  According to data of the Dagestan MVD, some of the armed 
groups that were disarmed in the Khasavyurtovskiy Rayon were 
previously in the Avar People's Front imeni Imam Shamil, and 
later they engaged in robberies. The local courts employed 
sanctions only in 24 percent of the examined cases concerning 
incidents of storing or employing arms. 
  The victims themselves frequently do not give true 
testimony, 
either out of fear or from a desire to take revenge 
independently, believes Colonel Dzharlayev. 
<H5>  Three Sources of Gunfire </H5>
  More than 30 nations live in Dagestan. All of them are 
natives, but the Avars and the Dargins are in the majority. This 
situation was recorded in the past elections: Representation in 
the new Russian parliament was acquired by the Avars (four 
seats) and the Dargins (two seats). One seat each, owing to 
party lists, was acquired by a Lak--the famous musician Murad 
Kazhlayev (PRES) [Party of Russian Unity and Accord], and a 
Russian--Semen Reshulskiy (Communist Party of Russia). 
  Besides the problems of representation in the local and 
federal organs of authority, another question is acute in 
Dagestan--land. There is not much land in Dagestan, and the 
fight over it has always been distinguished by its ferocity. The 
"free," that is, the flat lands that are suitable for settlement 
are only "Kumyk" in Dagestan--in accordance with an unofficial 
cadastre. But the more numerous Avar and Dargin populations are 
counting on them, and also the Laks, who are leaving the lands 
of the Chechen-Aukhovs [chechentsy-aukhovtsy] that they occupy. 
And today's calm will not last long--until the spring sowing 
campaign. 
  What strikes the eye is that the terror has been directed 
against politicians who represent the small nations of the 
republic. Gadiz Gadzhiyev is a Lak, Toturbiyev and Bagautdin 
Gadzhiyev are Kumyks, Said Amirov is a Dargin, and Arsen 
Bayramov is a Lezgin. Abdurazak Mirzabekov, the chairman of the 
Council of Ministers of the republic, is a Kumyk. (The last 
refused to run for the Federation Council. Did he behave 
reasonably?) 
  In recent years, the "conflict of generations" was added to 
the traditional contradictions. The key posts in the leadership 
of the republic are occupied by those who come from the 
nomenklatura or their successors. Relying on the strength of the 
state apparatus, they successfully rivaled their competitors, 
who accommodated themselves to market relations better than 
they. The "new people," probably bet on Moscow, uniting around 
Ramazan Abdulatipov. It seems that this party would like to lean 
on the capital in the fight against local opponents. It is 
precisely this way that the republic perceived Abdulatipov's 
statement that the two candidates to the Federal Assembly were 
shot for criticizing higher Dagestan officials. 
  In recent years, journalists and specialists have not ceased 
to be amazed: All of the prerequisites for a conflict in 
Dagestan are present: ethnic diversity, shortage of land, and a 
low standard of living, but there is no serious bloodshed. The 
people of the republic, where any conflict will inevitably be 
transformed into a war of everyone against everyone, it appears, 
are retaining the instinct for self-preservation. Apparently, 
nothing can restrain the politicians from "sorting things out." 
The forthcoming parliamentary elections in Dagestan in June will 
show whether they are in a condition to stop.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Around One-Third of the Export of </F>
Vladimir Oblast Has Gone to Iran"] 
  [Text] The volume of export deliveries by Vladimir Oblast 
in 1993 reached 60.4 billion rubles (R), according to revised 
data of the oblast statistical administration. According to the 
preliminary data compiled at the beginning of January, export 
comprised around R40 billion. According to information obtained 
from an unofficial source, the correction is explained by the 
contract concluded at the end of December 1993 by the Degtyarev 
Plant for the delivery of its products to Iran in a sum on the 
order of R20 billion. The relative share of export deliveries 
within the overall volume of goods produced is estimated at 5.4 
percent, as compared to 3 percent in 1992. (According to the 
data of this same statistical administration, the overall 
production volume declined by 17.3 percent in 1993 as compared 
with 1992, to a sum of R1118 million). At the same time, export 
deliveries of the machine building sector comprised 51 percent. 
Ferrous metallurgy products comprised 31 percent, textile 
products--6 percent, chemical products--6 percent, and lumber 
materials--5 percent. The number of exporter enterprises 
increased from 17 to 79. The main suppliers are the Degtyarev 
Plant, the Vladimir Tractor Plant, the Ordzhonikidze Plant, the 
Aleksandrovskiy Radio Plant and the Kovrovskiy Excavator Plant. 
The greatest relative share of export went to Iran and Germany. 
Import comprised R26.4 billion. China and Germany were among the 
main suppliers. Food products (sugar, rice, tea, canned goods) 
comprised around 30 percent of the import, grain for industrial 
processing--23 percent, consumer goods--17 percent, 
machine-technical products--10 percent, and medicines--4 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by unidentified correspondent: "Sakhalin </F>
Authorities Strengthen Control Over Foreign Trade"] 
  [Text] Sakhalin governor Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov signed a 
directive on 11 February according to which all agreements and 
contracts concluded with foreign firms on behalf of the 
administration of the oblast and its subdivisions are subject to 
expert analysis in the oblast administration of international 
and foreign economic relations and to coordination with the 
financial organs. All enterprises and organizations that go into 
the international market are obliged to submit information to 
the governor's office once each quarter on negotiations and 
agreements reached with foreign companies. According to the text 
of the directive, the necessity for such control is the result 
of "an increase in the extensiveness of export of raw materials 
without the creation of a basis for long-term economic activity 
of a majority of the participants in foreign economic relations 
and its negative influence on the formation of prices in the 
international market." In 1993, 380 enterprises and 
organizations were engaged in export-import operations on 
Sakhalin. The turnover totaled $390 million, given a prolonged 
balance of $90 million. Exporter accounts received $222.3 
million; however, according to the estimates of authorities, the 
incomes could have been one and a half times higher. Poorly 
orienting themselves with respect to prices on the world market, 
the enterprises that got into it for the first time sometimes 
sold fish, biological resources, commercial timber, and saw 
timber at prices that were cheaper by a factor of two or more.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Pavlovich Chubay, chairman of the </F>
Trade Union Federation of the Maritime Region, conducted by 
Albert Kubarev; date and place not given] 
  [Text] [Kubarev] I first met with my interlocutor, the 
chairman of the Trade Union Federation of the Maritime Region, 
Vladimir Chubay, in Vladivostok soon after the strikes which 
occurred there. Recall that in August of last year 370 
enterprises in the Maritime Region stopped work for a period of 
from 2 to 24 hours. They struck in literally all sectors of the 
economy. 
  As is well-known, at that time a "landing force" of 80 
ministers and their deputies together with the chairman of the 
government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, came immediately to the Far 
East. 
  But now half a year has passed. Vladimir Pavlovich was in 
Moscow on business, and when I met him here, naturally I wanted 
to know if there had been any changes. 
  [Chubay] There have been, but for the worse. Based on the 
results of the commission's work, the government adopted a 
decree. It is not a bad document; it envisions a solution to our 
basic problems: allocation of subsidies for the fuel and energy 
complex, lower rates for transport shipping, and customs charges 
are authorized to remain in the kray. But several months have 
already passed and the paper really has not taken effect. 
Moreover, we got a telegram from first vice premier Gaydar, who 
now is already former vice premier. He told us not to expect 
subsidies for bread, to take care of it ourselves. 
  But may I ask you, what can we do ourselves now when both 
under the tsar and under Soviet power 50 percent of the food was 
imported into the Far East from other regions? We do not grow 
grain at all. An altogether different complex was established 
here: machine building and fish, defense, and other sectors of 
industry. And suddenly, right before winter comes this telegram. 
To get grain you need some time and money. Our most critical 
problem is transport. No matter what you are doing, everything 
has to be imported from somewhere. And the price of transport, 
despite the promises, has doubled again recently. 
  In short, the situation is desperate. The electricity has 
been turned off at enterprises which did not pay their bills to 
Dalenergo [Far East Energy System]. But how can they pay when 
their partners have not paid them? It is an endless circle. 
Dalenergo owes 40 billion rubles [R] to coal and black oil 
suppliers. 
  Among our neighbors, in Japan, and even in America the cost 
of electricity is the same throughout the country. There 
electricity prices and, incidentally, grain prices too are 
regulated by the state. But here the hydroelectric power plant 
collective of 200 people privatizes the enterprise and inflates 
prices at their own discretion. 
  Several days ago the hot water supply to apartments was shut 
off. And the way they are heated the mercury column in the 
thermometer does not rise above 12 degrees. Is that really 
normal? People are forced to get small stoves ["burzhuyka's"], 
especially in settlements. 
  [Kubarev] Vladimir Pavlovich, a few days ago there was a 
report in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA from the settlement of Bolshoy 
Kamen. The state incurred debts of R20 billion to the Zvezda 
defense plant. The workers have been without pay for 2 months. 
When I was there, they complained of the same troubles. But the 
chairman of the brigades council, Sergey Savitskiy, reassured 
the comrades: "The government knows about us now and will take 
steps." And the people believed the promises. 
  [Chubay] Of course they believed them. That is not what is 
striking. How can officials of such high state rank give 
promises so easily and not fulfill them? 
  [Kubarev] But are you really saying that the decree is not 
bad? And that apparently someone else altogether is to blame for 
it not working? 
  [Chubay] No, I do not agree! Do you remember what I told you 
surprised us most at the meetings with the governmental 
commission? 
  [Kubarev] Yes, I remember very well. And what I was told by 
many people, incidentally, in particular the chairman of the 
dock workers trade union of the Vladivostok Trade Port, V. 
Reksha: "We have sent 3,000 letters and telegrams to Moscow on 
the terrible situation in the kray. Not a word in response. And 
then suddenly members of the commission which visited us 
announce that they did not know anything about the crisis! Then 
just how are simple people supposed to get through to the 
authorities?" 
  You do not have to dig back into your memory very far: 
highly 
placed officials' references to their lack of information are 
not so very rare. The thought comes to mind: isn't the reason 
that our lives are getting worse and worse that the 
powers-that-be do not know anything about it and simply do not 
want to know? 
  [Chubay] That is just the trouble. Our Far East has been 
driven into a corner! It is no secret that we have quite a large 
number of military men and a large fleet. And everyone has to be 
fed, and we receive this telegram: do not expect grain. On a 
business trip to Moscow, I visited your stores here: eggs and 
meat are a bit cheaper but they do not leave the counters. 
People say, your (that is, our) pay is higher. Is that so? 
Miners who extract tungsten, lead, and tin under difficult 
conditions receive 50,000. Tell me, how does a miner live? 
Things are even worse for fishermen. 
  The real disaster is fuel. Because of the lack of it, ships 
cannot go to sea and sometimes are not even able to return to 
port. 
  I am ashamed to say that the fishermen go to the shores of 
South Korea for fuel and buy our very own fuel there, at three 
times the price, for hard currency. It is delivered there by 
Russian businessmen who buy it from the state for a song. 
  What do we do, get people to strike again? So that we are 
again accused of playing politics? We do not want a strike, we 
want to work productively and restore the country. Alas, the 
Maritime Region has the highest mortality rate in Russia. 
Especially among old men, they are just mowed down, and we bury 
them... in plastic bags. 
  [Kubarev] So there is no way out? 
  [Chubay] Why, what do you mean? A new parliament has been 
elected and the government has been reformed. I think that we 
will find aid and support from them all the same. We are 
approaching the elections to local organs of representative 
power. Of the 28 seats in the kray duma, we figure to get at 
least one-third. We hope that our deputies will not be so 
hard-of-hearing as those fly-in hotshots.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bogdan Vladimirovich Budzulyak, member of </F>
the governing board of the RAO [Russian Joint Stock Company] 
Gazprom, conducted by Viktor Andriyanov; time and place not 
given] 
  [Text] We met with Bogdan Vladimirovich a long way 
from Moscow, in Ukhta when Severgazprom [North Gas Industry] was 
celebrating its 25th anniversary. He felt at home here--after 
all 20 years of his life had been given to the North. Starting 
as a worker, a foreman, he rose through the ranks, as people 
say, to general director of a large production association. 
Before his eyes and with his participation Vuktyl was developed, 
lines were laid to the Center, and the first steps were taken 
toward the extraction of natural gas in the Yamal area. 
  [Andriyanov] For many years the country called for 
volunteers 
to develop the North. Now, as RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA has already 
written, streams are beginning to flow in the opposite 
direction, and the migration of people from the northern cities 
and settlements is beginning on the level of the state. And if 
you take a look not from the situation at this particular moment 
but taking into account the strategic interests of Russia, is it 
justified to say, Bogdan Vladimirovich, that this is the latest 
great migration process? 
  [Budzulyak] Yes, of course, you can. I will try to justify 
this conclusion. Remember how the assimilation of the northern 
oil and gas deposits went. For the most part migrants from the 
southern regions of the Union rendered these krays habitable, 
migrants from Central Russia, Kuban, and Ukraine. Mines were 
built and near them settlements and cities. But deposits do not 
last forever. The oil, gas, and condensate were taken and there 
was nothing more there. But what about the people? The city? 
What could the population do? 
  Another feature is the climate. Only a person who was born 
here could live his entire life in the North. People from other 
places must sooner or later leave. 
  [Andriyanov] But why were these cities and settlements there 
in the permafrost zone? 
  [Budzulyak] Technology necessitates such decisions. 
Technology did not permit operation of the mines from a 
distance. And that is why the cities and settlements developed 
according to their own logic. The satellite enterprises, the 
social infrastructure. 
  The path of automation must be followed. Together with 
German 
firms our military-industrial complex enterprises, in particular 
the Scientific Research Institute of Measurement Systems from 
Nizhniy Novgorod, developed the latest control systems. On the 
new lines the primary compressor plants in the permafrost zone 
will be completely automated. Remote control and a minimum of 
service personnel. The tour-of-duty workers flew in, worked for 
15 days, and then, back to their families. 
  In general migration from the North, or rather from a number 
of oil and gas regions, has objectively become necessary. And 
the new development plans rule out bringing in excess people. 
Permanent housing will be in the Mainland, and only work here. 
  Remember how the assimilation of the deposits went in former 
years? Deliver the gas by such-and-such a date! And it was done, 
at all costs. Now it is possible to prepare carefully for going 
into new deposits. We ourselves determine, based on the market's 
needs, when and which deposits must be commissioned. 
  [Andriyanov] Despite the enormous debts... 
  [Budzulyak] Yes, the consumers received the gas but paid for 
only one-half. The debt to Gazprom is approaching R3 trillion. 
Including the consumer debt in Russia itself. 
  Recently I participated in negotiations with the leadership 
of Ukraine. A long-term governmental agreement was discussed. 
The government of Ukraine will ensure the construction of 
housing for Northerners on the territory of Russia and Ukraine 
to pay off the debt for gas. Ukraine will pay off another part 
of the debt using credit which it receives from Russia. 
  The debts increased greatly after prices rose, to world 
levels. We proposed to reduce the price for gas supplied to 
Ukraine, Belarus, and other CIS countries so that rates for gas 
transit would decline at the same time. These proposals were 
supported by the edict of the RF president "On the Russian Joint 
Stock Company Gazprom Ensuring a Reliable Gas Supply to 
Consumers in 1994-1996." This document also envisioned other 
provisions which are fundamentally important in order to develop 
the new deposits of natural gas at an accelerated rate and 
reinforce Russia's export potential. 
  [Andriyanov] We flew from slushy Moscow, and in Ukhta it was 
35 below. 
  [Budzulyak] And every degree of lower temperature is another 
almost 40 million cubic meters of gas a day. We have to boost 
field production immediately and take gas from the storage 
tanks. The entire system has to be in readiness and very 
flexible. 
  [Andriyanov] That is probably possible only with unified 
control of the country's entire gas system. 
  [Budzulyak] Such a system has already been created in our 
country. The Unified Gas Supply System. 
  [Andriyanov] But it bothers some people a great deal: they 
talk of monopoly and are preparing drafts to deregulate the 
energy market. 
  [Budzulyak] Altogether incompetent people could prepare such 
a draft. 
  [Andriyanov] Or, on the other hand, overly competent people. 
  [Budzulyak] Possibly. At their promptings the oil industry 
has been spoiled, and every year it loses up to 50 million in 
production. But the oil workers are not bound so tightly by 
these pipes as gas workers. 
  Western well-wishers give their recommendations based on the 
experience of building gas pipe systems in America. But where is 
America and where are we? They have closed deposits and local 
gas supply regions. In our country that is impossible. If 
certain structures are broken up, extraction and transport ones, 
the consumer will not get his gas. Whom can he work with when 
there are about 3 million consumers in Russia alone? Where will 
he go? To Tyumen? To Urengoy? Nadym? A lot of small monopolies 
will immediately appear. Because every person sits on some 
spigot, on some valve. If they do not like the conditions--they 
close it and shut it off. 
  [Andriyanov] Recommendations may be given for the best of 
motives. It is the job of the bosses to accept them or not. 
  [Budzulyak] The point is that they are stubbornly trying to 
convince us to do it just that way. And Mintopenergo [Ministry 
of Fuel and Energy], when Lopukhin was the head of the Ministry, 
took that position too. Even now some do. For it is no accident 
that such documents as the edict of the RF president on 
deregulating the energy market have appeared. 
  Here is another example. Recently Gazprom signed a credit 
agreement with one of the largest Italian firms. 
  [Andriyanov] RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA reported on that deal. 
  [Budzulyak] But how strong the pressure of certain 
structures 
on the government of Italy and the Italian banks to prevent this 
credit deal remained out of the picture. They demanded 
guarantees from the government of Russia and property as 
collateral. That naturally offended us. Many firms want to work 
with us and are working with us, knowing that Gazprom is 
solvent, has hard currency, and returns credits on time. 
  We worked with our partners on this agreement for two years. 
And then the hitches which I talked about appeared in the final 
stage. Now it is signed and Gazprom enterprises will be 
allocated capital to buy the equipment needed to reconstruct and 
technically re-equip the sector from Italy's firms. Cooperative 
production of gas pump units has been organized with Germany at 
the Kirov Plant in Petersburg. We worked on this project for a 
year and a half. 
  Of course, we are developing our own units. Tests on a unit 
made in Sumy based on components and an engine from the 
Semarskiy Plant will now begin at the testing unit in Tolyatti. 
The Saturn concern and the well-known aviation engine 
association "Lyulka" are participating in the program with the 
Italians. An engine with a high KPD [efficiency factor]--up to 
36 percent--has been developed. Perm motor builders created a 
unit that is essential to replace equipment which has exhausted 
its service life. 
  Overall the program of technical re-equipping is focused on 
domestic plants. The most important thing in it is raising 
efficiency so that fewer expenditures will yield better results. 
  [Andriyanov] RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA intends to talk in detail 
about how this program is being carried out. 
  [Budzylyak] We will be grateful to you. It is a big job 
important to the whole country. For ahead lies development of 
the Yamal area, the Barents Sea shelf, the Island of Sakhalin, 
and the Shtokmanovskiy Deposit. Heat for all Russia is there.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Ivashchenko: "Chinese Peasants Outpace </F>
Russians"] 
  [Text] Negotiations have begun in the Jewish Autonomous 
Oblast on bringing Chinese seasonal laborers into the fields of 
collective farms in the Amur region. A delegation of businessmen 
from the PRC visiting Birobidzhan is prepared to bring, 
immediately if desired, hundreds of Chinese peasants into local 
villages in exchange for metals, fertilizers, and equipment. 
Last year more than 600 gast-arbeiters from the neighboring 
country were working in the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes of 
the autonomy alone. Some private farmers have engaged the 
foreign "hired farm hands" as well. In this regard, instances of 
illegal transport of Chinese were noted, for which no one was 
held accountable. 
  Today freedom of transport of manual labor from abroad is 
significantly restricted by recently adopted governmental 
documents. The engagement of foreign labor is subject to 
mandatory licensing with local administrations, for example. 
This measure is a timely one in the opinion of many, because the 
previous lack of control led many times to sad consequences for 
the Russians involved, who suffered losses from cooperation 
which was not always equal. 
  Last year's experience shows that unemployed Chinese travel 
to Russia not so much to work hard in the fields as to engage in 
trading at the flea markets. And in no way do all of them manage 
to accomplish both tasks without detriment to the harvest. 
Because of this, some farms in the autonomy were forced to 
cancel contracts and send the sad excuses for helpers back to 
their native land early. 
  Nonetheless, the oblast agricultural administration assures 
us that in the majority of cases, bringing in foreigners is well 
justified. At least as far as money is concerned. Certain farms 
have been able to obtain up to R50 million in profit through the 
Chinese--a ponderable alternative to bank credits borrowed at 
213 percent interest, which is still not available to all... 
  But cautions are being sounded today as well: Excessive 
enthusiasm for foreigners might destroy our own peasant labor. 
Seasonal workers live day to day--it is important to them to 
achieve a result right now. But no matter how impressive the 
result, the main problems of the Russian agrocomplex over the 
long term will not be resolved by virtue of Chinese labor. 
  Finally, is it not strange to be finding jobs for unemployed 
foreigners when our own out-of-work people have nowhere to go? 
Arguments that "our own" are not offering to help and are 
showing no initiative are hardly legitimate. No one has yet 
summoned them to the fields; no one is training or organizing 
them. 
  But the oblast administration labor department believes 
priority will soon be confirmed for the Russian unemployed 
worker. Even if only through licensing: Farms and enterprises 
situated in the so-called manpower-surplus regions are about to 
get their marching orders. This, incidentally, is also a 
requirement of the federal authorities.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Kandaurov, member of the Amur Region </F>
Russian Geographic Society: "The Secrets of Demarcation"] 
  [Text] It will soon be a year now that efforts have 
been underway on demarcation of the Russian-Chinese border. But 
it is far from likely that every inhabitant of the region could 
say with certainty just what comprises the essence of the issue 
and what it is that our neighbors on the other side of the Amur 
are striving to attain. Naturally, quite a number of disputes 
and various positions have emerged on the subject of border 
demarcation. In this article Ivan Kandaurov, member of the Amur 
Region Russian Geographic Society, expresses his point of 
view. 
  A great quantity of material has been written on demarcation 
of the Russian-Chinese border. But the individual, practical 
aspects of demarcation remain a secret for inhabitants of the 
Far East in general and the residents of Khabarovsk in 
particular. Nor do regular public presentations by Genrikh 
Vasilyevich Kireyev, special assignment ambassador of the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and head of the demarcation 
effort, provide any clarification. 
  No one disputes that the Russian-Chinese border must be put 
in order, because according to the Aygun (1858) and Beijing 
(1860) Treaties, in the interests of China (against whom England 
and France manifest aggression and there was danger that a unit 
from a British-French squadron would envelop China's rear using 
the Amur and Ussuri), the border was determined by the right 
bank of the Amur and left bank of the Ussuri, i.e., the water 
surface was controlled, and later assimilated, by the Russian 
side. According to the present protocol, the border is to be 
determined according to the generally recognized international 
principle: on navigable rivers--along the centerline of the main 
channel; on nonnavigable rivers--along the centerline of the 
river or its main branch. 
  One would think such a formulation of the issue would suit 
the Chinese--they would get about 2,000 square kilometers of 
island territory in an entirely civilized resolution of the 
problem. However, attempting to take advantage of the unstable 
domestic situation in Russia, the Chinese desire to annex as 
well the Tarabarovo-Ussuri island group, whose total area 
amounts to about 30 square kilometers. 
  Mikhail Gorbachev and Aleksandr Bessmertnykh signed a treaty 
on demarcation efforts (May 1991) at a time that was not the 
most advantageous for the Soviet Union (Russia). They were 
unable to secure a protocol on project implementation which 
would incorporate the entire border trace without excluding 
"certain sectors." Reaching agreement with the exception of 
"certain sectors" owing to the unyielding demand of the Chinese, 
our side found itself already in an unequal position, and the 
apple of discord remained for future generations. 
  One of these exceptions is the section of border that runs 
along the Kazakevichevo Channel near Khabarovsk. A half-and-half 
decision in this instance is impermissible and fraught with the 
prospect of further border complications that could have 
unforeseen consequences. To facilitate the demarcation process, 
the 4,300 kilometers of border were split up into 10 sectors. 
There is a hidden danger here that efforts will be coordinated 
by sector beforehand, causing the overall picture to become 
fragmented and the problem of border sectors in dispute--the 
Kazakevichevo Channel for example--to fade from memory. This 
would clearly not be to Russia's advantage. 
  Quite some time prior to the time demarcation efforts were 
begun, the Chinese had already decided the fate of the 
Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands. Thus, page 72 of the atlas of 
Heilongjiang Province, published back in 1986, shows the 
Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands as Chinese territory (!). This atlas 
is distributed at various international conferences, i.e., the 
concept is being imbued in people of the Far East that the 
Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands sooner or later will be transferred to 
China. Moreover, in designating these islands as a part of their 
territory, the Chinese have informed the entire world that the 
islands belong to China but are (in fact) within Russia. In 
other words, it happens that Russia is acting as the aggressor 
in this instance, having occupied lands belonging to China, and 
must therefore supposedly return them. The Chinese even invented 
a name for this island group--the Fuyuang Triangle. 
  The Russians have repeatedly attempted to deepen the 
Kazakevichevo Channel, to make it navigable and admit Chinese 
river vessels from the Amur to the Ussuri through it, thereby 
reducing the journey. But the Chinese categorically object, 
believing that this is not a border channel, but a channel 
belonging to territorial China. Therefore, Chinese ships pass 
through at Chumka--precisely where our neighbors believe the 
border should pass. In this regard, whereas previously Chinese 
ships passing from the Amur to Amur Channel and back were 
accompanied by the Russian border service, now the Chinese 
exercise free reign. 
  We know from the history of Russian-Chinese relations that 
these islands have belonged to Russia since the time of the 
signing of the Aygun and Beijing Treaties. Moreover, Russia has 
invested significant monetary and material resources in the 
exploitation and development of arable land on these islands and 
is utilizing them fairly actively to supply the people of 
Khabarovsk with agricultural products. The islands are included 
within the Khabarovsk Rural Rayon and belong chiefly to the 
agricultural enterprise Zarya. Older residents of Khabarovsk 
remember how some 20 or 30 years ago the waters of the Amur and 
Amur Channel met in a powerful current at the Amur (Muravyev) 
Cliffs. The flow velocity of the two currents was such that it 
was difficult for a motorboat to travel against them. This no 
longer happens, because the Amur has changed its course and now 
flows into the Beshenaya and Penza Channels. While the Ussuri 
islands are growing due to the formation of an ever enlarging 
spit which can clearly be seen from the Amur Cliffs even when 
the water is at mid-stage. 
  Ecology experts have determined that the Amur is changing 
its 
course not in spontaneous fashion, but singlemindedly in the 
direction of the Russian shore under the influence of artful 
hydrotechnical structures set up by the Chinese on their shores. 
  As a result, well known Damanskiy Island, in mid-stream of 
the Ussuri River, has been turned into a peninsula by the 
Chinese and taken away from Russia entirely apart from any 
demarcation effort, with the silent consent of the Russian 
leadership. The Chinese are going all out in the resolution of 
all the border issues and, unfortunately, success is presently 
accompanying them. 
  If at Khabarovsk the border passes along the Amur main 
channel, and the Chinese consider that the Ussuri flows into the 
Amur Channel not at the village of Kazakevichevo but merges with 
the Amur at the Amur Cliffs, then as time passes Kabelnyy Island 
and others will join with the Tarabarovo-Ussuri group. And this 
is no fantasy. With such a solution to the problem, it may turn 
out that the railroad bridge (and tunnel as well) at Khabarovsk 
will pass through the territory of our adjacent state. 
  Count Muravyev-Amurskiy, who signed the Aygun Treaty and 
prepared the signing of the Beijing Treaty, stated: "Russia's 
presence here is firm and long-standing!" God willing, may his 
prophecy come true. 
  Genrikh Kireyev, in Khabarovsk in March of 1993, conducted 
several meetings with the leaders of Khabarovsk Kray in which he 
told those present that border demarcation efforts should be 
undertaken in a kind of semi-secret mode, without broad 
participation on the part of the concerned populace. 
  L. Ivanyuta, former deputy head of administration of 
Khabarovsk Kray, became a member of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs commission from Khabarovsk Kray on a purely formal 
basis. While Vladimir Vasilyevich Simakhin, chief inspector for 
geodesic oversight in the Far East (I note--in the entire Far 
East), lives and works in Khabarovsk, is a professionally 
trained specialist, and has an excellent understanding of the 
issues related to the determination of land and sea borders. And 
I believe his services would prove very useful to the commission 
of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But Vladimir 
Vasilyevich has been spending a great deal of time attempting on 
his own to get into the commission of the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs on demarcation of the Russian-Chinese border. He 
has traveled to Moscow repeatedly, but all in vain. 
  Taking advantage of an extremely favorable environment, the 
Chinese are hastening to get the demarcation work done, 
especially in those areas of the southern Maritime region where 
the border runs along dry land. The situation may change sharply 
for the Chinese if people accede to power in Russia who put 
first emphasis on the question of fighting for the interests of 
great Russia and its indigenous peoples who several centuries 
ago assimilated this semi-desert territory and initiated 
"Russian life on the Amur." 
  When Khabarovsk Kray head of administration V. Ishayev 
stated 
in one of his interviews--"We will never agree to hand over the 
Great Ussuri and Tarabarovo Islands," the Chinese consulate in 
Khabarovsk immediately requested clarification: Was this the 
official position of the authorities or was the governor 
speaking as a private citizen? 
  When Viktor Chernomyrdin was in Khabarovsk, he stated that 
we 
would not give up one inch of our land, including the islands 
near Khabarovsk. He stated this clearly in Russian--directly, 
openly, and firmly. But this is no consolation to the people of 
Khabarovsk. The problem remains an open issue. At this same 
conference, he also "removed" the problem of the Kuril Islands. 
But the development of events has shown that the problem remains. 
  Territorial games have always concealed within themselves 
danger and unforeseen consequences. I therefore consider it 
necessary to petition the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
with a proposal to undertake measures and insert in the protocol 
an additional point on completing work on the border section 
which runs along the divide of the Kazakevichevo Channel (near 
the disputed Tarabarovo-Ussuri islands). This matter must be 
considered a vitally important issue for Khabarovsk Kray, 
especially for future generations. The issue should be 
officially presented before the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs regarding the inclusion of V. Simakhin, chief inspector 
for geodesic oversight in the Far East, as a member of the 
Commission on Demarcation of the Russian-Chinese Border. 
Petition should also be made to include G. Levkin within the 
joint Russian-Chinese working group for Khabarovsk Kray. Levkin 
is a reserve colonel, a topographer with higher education, a 
participant in the demarcation of the Russian-Mongolian border, 
a historian, and a student of local folklore. 
  Until these questions are resolved, the work on demarcation 
in Khabarovsk Kray should be halted.

Blagoveshchensk: "Calculating on Accord. Communists Named Their 
Bloc `Amur's Choice'"] 
  [Text] Remaining quiet for a time after the recent fight 
for a seat in the Russian parliament, various political forces 
of Amur Oblast are organizing once more and are coming out in 
another round of the political fight. The Amur governor 
scheduled elections to the local organs of representative 
authority for 27 March, and for the petty province they are no 
less, if no more, of an irritant than the fight for a cushy job 
in remote Moscow. Really, there are two important forces that 
are capable of influencing the precarious mood of this same 
province, here, on the Amur: the young and ambitious democratic 
movement, under the aegis of Russia's Choice, is opposed by the 
regional organizations of the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation, the Agrarian Party, the SPT [Socialist Party of 
Workers], the Union of Communists, the RKRP [Russian Communist 
Workers Party], the Amur Communist Union of Youth, and the 
oblast Council of Veterans. But this was not enough for the 
opponents of the democrats: They quickly, it seems, so as not to 
appear before the people in an odious "leading and guiding 
uniform," for sake of appearances organized the neutral-looking 
associations Amur Voter and Amur's Choice. Calculating on 
accord: Perhaps the voter will fall for the speculative 
subterfuge of the communists; after all, Russia's Choice in 
December, given all of its miscalculations, was the only one 
that was able to oppose the communists. 
  The latter, in their turn, garnered 14 percent of the votes 
in the elections to the Federal Assembly, which, in the opinion 
of the oblast management of Russia's Choice, indicates a 
reduction in their social base in the Amur region, until 
recently considered to be a "Red island" in the Far East. This 
fact, however, appeared to be a poor consolation for the 
democrats, who permitted not only the Communist Party to move 
ahead, but also the Agrarians. Not one representative from 
Russia's Choice or the DDR [Democratic Reform Movement] in 
Moscow made such a breakthrough. 
  New elections are approaching, the fight for local power is 
nearing, and, alas, the scenario of the lost battle is repeating 
itself. Once again, as it was two months ago, the democrats are 
small in number, "terribly far from the people," and, on top of 
it all, despite their own recognition of the reasons for the 
December defeat, are as disunited as before. Once again, 
Russia's Choice has its own candidates, and the democratic 
reform movement has its own, and the oblast administration, 
which most of all should not be indifferent to what kind of 
elected oblast public assembly will result once again, has its 
own views on the figures that will make it and mechanisms for 
achieving victory. The question is whether there will be a 
victory, but fights among themselves, judging by everything, 
cannot be avoided, and that is all that is needed by the fellows 
from the Communist Party, which is "beloved by the people." 
  Once again logomachy, phrase-mongering, the explanation of 
attitudes toward a subject, who said what, or who failed to hear 
something are in fashion. But the Communist Party is not dozing. 
And the representatives in the past elections stood watch 
literally at each election precinct, they sat for hours, as if 
screwed to their chairs, next to the ballot boxes. And they 
intend today to act with no less proletarian persistence. The 
Amur Oblast electoral commission had barely made the decision on 
the organization of the electoral districts for the elections of 
deputies for the Amur Oblast assembly, when the communists 
urgently conducted their plenum on the mobilization of their 
forces for 27 March. Places were determined for each party 
"screw" in the class struggle for the hearts of the voters. 
  Which cannot be said of the executive authority in the 
localities. I made telephone calls to a number of cities and 
rayons in the Amur region and, in essence, I heard everywhere 
the standard: The work is just unfolding, and tactical 
approaches and strategic aims are being determined. Of the 
parties and movements in the rural rayons, only the communists 
are prevailing completely--other political forces, they say, are 
not visible. This information was reported in an invariably 
cheerful tone--we will fight, they said, and oppose, and so on. 
They also "fought" in December, but the result was negative. Let 
us hope complacency does not take over once again, that same 
ephemeral fancy of the greatness, speaking in the words of the 
poet, "in one's own position...."

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Borisevich, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI </F>
correspondent, Syktyvkar: "Projects; Danish `Master Plan' for 
the Republic of Komi"] 
  [Text] "Denmark's breakthrough on the front of 
cooperation with Russia occurred in the Republic of Komi," is 
the way that Mr. Nils Alman Olsen, a member of the Danish 
parliament and speaker on questions of foreign policy, assessed 
the results of the work in the north. 
  The Danish company N.R. Konsult A/C worked for 15 months on 
the composition of a project for the development of business in 
the region. The republic itself was the project client. The 
situation with Western investors prompted it to take this step. 
Their interest in the northern riches is enormous, but specific 
cooperation is arranged with great difficulty. And although 
one-tenth of all foreign investments in Russia is already in 
Komi today, this is not the limit, by far. But in order to 
interest Western investors, a guarantee of the firms to which 
they are committed is necessary and, in addition, projects are 
needed that are drawn up taking into account the world practice 
in preparing documents of this kind. The Danish company has 
undertaken to perform this work. Its interests coincided with 
the readiness of the Danish Government for cooperation with 
Russia; therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark 
allocated the resources to cover the hard currency part of the 
costs. 
  A project office, which received the name "Master Plan," was 
opened a year ago in Syktyvkar. From the Danish side, 
representatives of an aggregate of 10 companies participated in 
the work on Komi territory. Komi enterprises assumed the ruble 
part of the costs. Scientists and leading specialists of 
branches of the economy of the republic took part in the 
collection, processing, and analysis of materials. The results 
of the work were formulated in the reports "Concerning the 
Problems and Capabilities of the Komi Republic" and "Concerning 
Strategic Recommendations," and "A Catalog of Projects." 
Incidentally, implementation of part of these projects has 
already been started. 
  The presentation of the Master Plan was held recently in 
Syktyvkar. Danish specialists and managers turned out to be a 
step ahead of other foreign companies: As a result of the work 
that has been done, they now possess not only the most accurate 
and detailed information, but they have also concluded very 
specific business contacts with entrepreneurs of the Komi 
Republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Bogdanov, head of the Moscow </F>
administration of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, by 
Maksim Polinin; place and date not given: "Democracy Needs 
Political Surveillance"] 
  [Text] Although corresponding presidential edicts, 
the Constitution, the Criminal Code, and other normative acts 
regulating operations of Russian special services do exist, the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] is in dire need of a 
more concrete legislative base. This is the opinion of Sergey 
Bogdanov, chief of the FCS' Moscow administration. He says that 
the ideal solution would be for the president to come forward 
with a legislative initiative. Especially keeping in mind that 
the situation is this: Democracy needs political 
surveillance. 
  [Polinin] Sergey Petrovich, frankly, the words "political 
surveillance" bring to mind illegal persecution of 
differently-minded individuals, returning us to the unpleasant 
times of unmasking internal enemies and dissidents. 
  [Bogdanov] This is precisely the reaction I expected. 
Political surveillance, they say, is a return to 1937. All 
right, I have a proposal: Let us come back to this notorious 
issue, but a little later. 
  [Polinin] Agreed. Then let me express hope that after 
numerous reshufflings and renamings, the FCS is finally left 
alone and given the opportunity to fulfill the functions it is 
tasked with, the main one of which is combating political 
terrorism. 
  [Bogdanov] Correct. In this respect, I want to give you an 
atypical example of FCS work which, however, highlights a score 
of sore problems for us. Everybody remembers the sensational 
Rostov affair involving an attempt to hijack a helicopter at the 
very end of last year. The reverberations were tremendous: All 
of society's attention was focused on this arrogant crime; the 
government was in consultations round the clock. In this case 
there was a whole bouquet of law violations: armed seizure of an 
air transport vessel; illegally depriving citizens of their 
freedom and using them as hostages; extortion in especially 
great amounts. Still, this cannot be classified as a purely 
terrorist act. 
  [Polinin] Many people had the impression that it is not that 
difficult to commit this sort of a crime, and that our 
enforcement structures sometimes look helpless. 
  [Bogdanov] This is a wrong impression. Although... Let me 
compare the current situation with the times of the KGB and MB 
[Ministry of Security], when as soon as signaled that an 
aircraft had been hijacked, Plan Nabat instantly went into 
effect over the entire territory of the country. This is a 
precisely laid-out scheme where everybody knew what they were 
supposed to do: the KGB, its local spetznaz units, 
transportation militia, and Aeroflot. Training maneuvers were 
conducted annually under this system with the participation of 
the Alpha team. There had been practically no failures. For 
instance, in 1975-1985 the KGB averted about 100 aircraft 
hijacking attempts, including 25 at the stage of hatching the 
plan and about 15 instances at the stage of carrying out the 
crime. Over these 10 years only five aircraft hijackings were 
actually accomplished, and those also were foiled. 
  [Polinin] Are you trying to say that in the Rostov case 
Nabat 
failed? 
  [Bogdanov] In principle, Nabat still exists; however, we 
have 
to admit that this system has faltered in Russia. It so happened 
that just before the hijacking the president's 21 December edict 
came out, liquidating the MB, and this caused a certain chaos 
and confusion among personnel. Operation Nabat had always been 
spearheaded by the chief of an oblast administration--in the 
past of the KGB, then later of the MB. He was the main actor, a 
single control center. But with the MB abolished, who was to be 
in charge of the operation? So, complete outsiders got involved. 
As a result, the head of oblast administration was directing all 
operations. All of this resembled a situation where the "top 
brass" handles the job instead of leaving it to the 
professionals. I will reveal a minor secret: The hijackers 
should be given credit in that their criminal plan was 
brilliantly thought-through and very well executed. That the 
criminals have been detained, the hostages released, and 
practically all the money returned we should thank... weather 
conditions. 
  [Polinin] Still, how can we avoid such flops in the future 
or 
at least get out of it with minimal losses? 
  [Bogdanov] This is where we are coming to the issue of 
political surveillance. The task of a special service such as 
the FCS is first and foremost to avert a crime while it is still 
in the stage of conception. Roughly put, as soon as a thought 
occurs to a person--Should I perhaps hijack a plane?--here it 
is: "Knock, knock, we are your friends"; our agent shows up, and 
we already know everything. I want to emphasize that for people 
who conceived such plans or even went into preparations for 
hijacking, there have been no criminal law or administrative 
consequences. That is, they were not arrested, detained, or even 
summoned for an official warning. Everything was done through 
the existing agents, or new agents were recruited among those 
close to perpetrators, and appropriate pressure was brought on 
them. 
  [Polinin] How? 
  [Bogdanov] Very simply. An agent bought a case of vodka and 
drunk with a potential hijacker until the latter lost any desire 
to hijack anything. All right, this is a joke; seriously--the 
person was persuaded to give up his criminal plans. Naturally, 
for some time he continued to remain under our covert control. 
As a result, a person often never even guessed that the FCS had 
played some role in his fate. 
  [Polinin] As I understand it, special services do not need 
muscle units of the Alpha and Vympel kind, is this not so? 
  [Bogdanov] The FCS system needs to have its own, 
sufficiently 
formidable in a professional sense, antiterrorist groups. It may 
be only a few units, but they must be properly trained, 
equipped, and given a clearly defined number of tasks and the 
area of application. World practice shows that special units are 
part of special services: in Austria it is Cobra; in the United 
States, Delta; in Germany, GS-9. And they are directly 
subordinated to heads of special services. However, 
counterintelligence work is not directly related to these units. 
Combat operations are not part of "pure" counterintelligence. We 
have never chased shotgun-armed bandits. At the same time, life 
makes its own corrections, forcing us to acquire armed assault 
teams. Therefore, I am convinced that the FCS, which has now 
been stripped of its muscle structure, will in time have a 
special unit. 
  [Polinin] Sergey Petrovich, I think now is a good time to 
talk about political surveillance. 
  [Bogdanov] I am willing to put all the dots over the "i's." 
Political surveillance is not combating legal parties, 
movements, or differently-minded individuals who are in 
opposition to the existing regime (president, government, 
parliament). As the president's edict says, political 
surveillance assumes undermining illegal armed formations, as 
well as political organizations which covertly pursue the goal 
of changing the existing system by armed or violent means. The 
same goes for parties, movements, and individuals who covertly 
incite interethnic and interconfessional strife or harbor 
separatist intentions. We are charged with these tasks directly 
by the Russian Constitution, and nobody argues with it. In this 
sense political surveillance appears simply as an instrument of 
FCS operations, which has a complete right to use its special 
capabilities, including agents, confidential liaisons, and 
special equipment against organizations and persons who fall 
within the definitions enumerated above. Thus, the quintessence 
of special service's work, which applied to a full extent to the 
FCS, is to prevent and foil any criminal action that represents 
a threat to state security, before it is committed, with the 
help of specific means and methods.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Statsenko: "Did Counterintelligence Save </F>
Sobchak?"] 
  [Text] At yesterday's briefing by the St. Petersburg 
Administration of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], 
which covered the results of last year's operations by the 
special service, journalists learned new details about the 
recent arrest of five terrorists near Our Lady of Kazan 
Cathedral (see NEVSKOYE VREMYA 3 February). 
  According to Aleksandr Kuznetsov, head of the FCS 
administration's antiterrorist unit, the arrested persons, some 
of whom had participated in the defense of the White House in 
Moscow in October 1993, were making preparations for an armed 
attack on one of the Petersburg militia precincts to seize 
armaments. Afterwards, they intended to assassinate Mayor 
Anatoliy Sobchak, and to organize a raid on the House of 
Government in Moscow. Among those detained is Aleksandr Bogdanov 
of Petersburg rallies fame. The investigation continues. 
  There are more than 30 organized criminal groups currently 
operating in the city on the Neva River who use the entire 
spectrum of intimidation methods: blackmail, threats, violence. 
The city is being divided into spheres of influence; there have 
been recorded attempts on the part of the criminal capital to 
acquire blocks of stock of a number of commercial banks and 
objects undergoing privatization. Administration personnel have 
identified and foiled activities of five criminal groups 
attempting to steal about 4 billion rubles [R] from city banks 
using forged documents. 
  They also foiled the illegal sale of almost 5,000 units of 
firearms, and derailed the sale to a commercial structure of 
5,000 smooth-bore rifles and 200 handguns. As was noted at the 
briefing, more than 1.5 million units of unregistered rifled 
firearms are currently in the hands of the Russian population. 
Also, while in the past such firearms had been mostly home-made, 
now the situation has changed--they are mainly factory-made 
arms, Western-made as a rule. The "leader" is the TT handgun 
made in China. 
  Eighty-five bombs went off in the city in 1993, killing 
eight 
persons and injuring 29. 
  "I will not be surprised if, having finished dividing 
property between criminal groups, the same groups start dividing 
political power," Aleksandr Kuznetsov said at the briefing. 
  Another problem for law enforcement organs is smuggling. 
Last 
year as a result of Operation Trawl, the guardians of security 
returned to the state more than 2,500 tonnes of nonferrous 
metals, 6,000 tonnes of petroleum products, about 22,000 cubic 
meters of timber, and other goods worth a total of R5 billion. 
Unfortunately, this work is not effective enough because of the 
poor material and technical support of customs and border 
services on the border with Estonia. There is a widespread 
practice of bribing customs officials. Criminals use all sorts 
of transportation, including military transport aircraft. 
Contraband cargo is escorted by armed guards, who frequently 
consist of military servicemen and militia personnel, who more 
than once resisted representatives of authority and law 
enforcement organs. 
  In conclusion the head of the FCS administration, Viktor 
Cherkesov, reported that recertification of personnel is 
expected to be completed before the end of March. Because the 
investigative department in the service has been abolished, the 
administration is switching to a new staff structure, while 
criminal cases currently under investigation have been 
transferred to the Procuracy. 
  "There is no question that after the Ministry of Security 
was 
abolished, the ranks of the Petersburg administration got 
thinner. But our agency is not going to turn into a relic--we 
will continue working," said Viktor Cherkesov.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova: "Democrats by Conviction, </F>
Rather Than by Profession"] 
  [Text] "All St.Petersburg" is an attempt to unite the 
efforts of people who are realistically working for the good of 
the city, the organizers of that pre-election bloc feel. 
Speaking at a press conference at the Petergof Hotel, they 
emphasized that "All St. Petersburg" is not a political 
association. "We are democrats by conviction, rather than by 
profession," Yuriy Derevyanko, Astrobank vice-president and 
former deputy to the city soviet, explained. 
  In his opinion, the City Assembly, first of all, should 
decide the problem of increasing the income part of the budget, 
but this necessitates supporting in an organized manner 
small-sized and medium-sized business and state enterprises. 
  "All St. Petersburg" assumes that the assembly will succeed 
in refining its rights, but the Statute that is currently in 
effect provides it with a sufficient amount of powers to begin 
work. The bloc is in favor of having the deputies carry out 
their activities on an unprofessional basis. According to 
Derevyanko, any employed individual who has organized his job 
normally will be able to set aside two days a week for deputy 
activities. 
  At the press conference it was noted that the association 
will nominate candidates, each of whom is a professional in his 
area and who can analyze the consequences of the decisions to be 
made. On the whole, however, the bloc leaders say that they will 
view the results of the voting as a victory if 75 percent of the 
mandates are given to intelligent persons -- not necessarily 
from "All St. Petersburg."

"Belyayev Wants To Meet With the Mayor in Court"] 
  [Text] Yesterday a case brought by Federation Council 
member Aleksandr Belyayev against St. Petersburg mayor Anatoliy 
Sobchak was supposed to have been heard in the city court. Mr. 
Belyayev is disputing the amendments and additions made by the 
mayor to the Statute Governing Elections to the City Assembly. 
In particular, in accordance with those amendments, Federation 
Council members cannot be elected as deputies to the assembly, 
which contradicts the Russian Constitution. 
  The court session scheduled for 15 February was rescheduled 
to Thursday as a result of the defendant's failure to appear in 
court -- Mr. Sobchak was at the opening of the Olympic Games in 
Lillehammer and was supposed to return to St. Petersburg last 
night. 
  As a Sobchak representative stated in court, the mayor 
allegedly was completely uninformed about the suit that had been 
initiated by Belyayev on 8 February.

  [Text] On the threshold of the election to the City 
Assembly, the number of public committees has increased by one 
more. The committee is called "Voter-94" and sets as its goal 
the helping of all of us not to make a mistake when forming the 
city's representative authority. 
  And, as becomes obvious from a committee message to St. 
Petersburgers which was received at the editorial office, it is 
easy to make a mistake. Because of the large number of mandates, 
the committee warns that competent people may be overlooked, and 
the persons who will get through to the City Assembly will be 
either less effective or more affluent contenders. 
  In order to prevent this from happening, the committee 
intends, first of all, to strive for a two-round voting system, 
which will reduce the probability of distorting the will of the 
voters, and, secondly, to propose and to make known to the city 
dwellers the criteria that enable them to evaluate a candidate's 
readiness to work in the city's legislative body. The committee 
calls upon specialists and representatives of all the interested 
public organizations and movements to cooperate in this work.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Chugunov: "Unemployment Will Grow"] </F>
  [Text] A rapid increase in unemployment is reported 
by the oblast committee on labor after analyzing last year's 
figures. 
  For the oblast as a whole, unemployment increased by a 
factor 
of more than 1.5 as compared with 1992. The oblast's eighteen 
employment offices registered a total of 27,400 unemployed 
during the year. In January, as compared with December, the 
number almost doubled. 
  As for the rayons specifically, the ones that proved to be 
in 
the most alarming situation were the most industrially developed 
ones. In Podporozhskiy Rayon the unemployment level passed the 
10-percent mark, reaching 11.5 percent; in Tikhvinskiy Rayon it 
came to 6.6 percent; in Kirishskiy Rayon, 5 percent; and in 
Priozerskiy Rayon, almost 4 percent. 
  The rayons that proved to be in the best situation in this 
regard were Luzhskoy Rayon, where 473 unemployed were 
registered; and Lodeynopolskiy Rayon, 553. 
  Last year almost 25,000 unemployed received unemployment 
benefits throughout the entire period and were unable to find 
suitable work. A total of 480 persons took the risk and 
underwent training or retraining in areas suggested by the 
employment service, thus increasing their competitive capability 
in the job market. But, unfortunately, it must be admitted that 
currently there are few people like this, who are capable of 
adapting to the new conditions and want to do so. A very large 
number of people do not want to change their occupation, even if 
the employment service pays for their retraining and gives them 
a stipend during the entire training period. 
  Among the reasons for being unemployed, the predominant one 
is "personal reasons," 44 persons. Only 24 percent are people 
who were laid off from enterprises or organizations as a result 
of reduction in forces, reorganization, or the elimination of 
the enterprise. Sixty-two percent of the unemployed in the 
oblast are women,and in Luzhskoy and Tosnenskiy rayons and in 
Sosnovyy Bor, the figure is as high as 90 percent. As for age, 
almost every third unemployed person is a young person between 
the age of 16 and 30 years. With regard to social makeup, the 
predominant group is people with working occupations (as many as 
66 percent), and only 34 percent are white-collar workers. 
  In 1994 it is expected that the number of unemployed will 
increase in most of the rayons in the oblast. And, for the labor 
market as a whole, there may prove to be 37,000-57,000 persons 
seeking work. 
  [Editorial note] At the same time the city's labor and 
employment committee reports that, during the first month of 
1994 (from 1 January through 4 February), 26,509 persons applied 
to the rayon offices in St. Petersburg, with 10,784 doing so in 
order to find a job. Only 1640 persons were deemed to be 
unemployed. But, since the beginning of the year, jobs were 
found for 3224 persons.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Kramarev, by Andrey Potapenko: "Along the </F>
`Shaky Bottom'"] 
  [Text] Arkadiy Kramarev: The main failure of the year 
is the increase in the number of undisclosed murders. The 
largest success is the lack of any major disorders in St. 
Petersburg. 
  Without any fear of getting into a stupid situation, 
the television reporter asks the businessman the question, "Who 
monitors you -- the `Chechens' or the `people from Tambov'?" And 
the businessman answers, with a certain grievance in his voice, 
"We deal only with `Malyshevskiy men.'" The most surprising 
thing in this dialogue is that he does not surprise anyone. 
  Quite recently, highly placed workers in the militia 
were indignant at journalists who spoke aloud about the Mafia 
and rackets. Incidentally, even today they are irritated by 
expressions such as "bandit city." They will look at a summary 
and say, for example, "Last year 125,083 crimes were committed 
in St. Petersburg, which is 18.3 percent more than in 1992. A 
comparative analysis attests to a reduction in the increase 
rates and to the stabilization of the crime level." And a 
cautious optimism will creep into their voice. 
  The view that the militia leadership takes of today's 
situation in the fight against crime, a view that is devoid of 
emotions, is what interested our correspondent during an 
interview he had with Major-General of Militia A. G. Kramarev, 
chief of the Main Administration of Internal Affairs of St. 
Petersburg and the oblast. 
  [Potapenko] Arkadiy Grigoryevich, is it possible to conclude 
from the statistical data that we have already seen the "bottom" 
and that the crime wave has started to recede? 
  [Kramarev] That is only partially true. Perhaps, with regard 
to the overall crime level, we have indeed reached the 
"saturation point." But you cannot say this about serious 
crimes, where we continue to observe an active increase, 
although at lesser rates. In St. Petersburg alone last year, 875 
murders were committed (twice as many as the previous year). 
  Thus, if we have indeed seen the "bottom," then it is still 
very shaky. The number of murders is increasing, and the rate of 
disclosing them is decreasing. Today every other premeditated 
murder remains unsolved. We have simply been inundated by that 
wave of crime. Whereas ten people, or sometimes even 20, used to 
participate in investigation, today we cannot assign even five 
people there. 
  For a long time crimes have not been solved in the way that 
Sherlock Holmes solved them: he smoked his pipe, played the 
violin, and the mystery was solved! Do you know how many people 
it takes to check out several stories? Take, for example, 
murders of merchants by hire. They occur, as a rule, against a 
background of conflicts in the commercial sphere. There are so 
many conflicts that checking out each of them requires one 
agent, or, even better, three. It takes a lot of time before all 
the stories can be checked out. 
  [Potapenko] Recently many crimes have been linked with the 
use of firearms. Criminals shoot at merchants, and shots are 
heard with increasing frequency at bandit meetings where various 
groupings fight for their spheres of influence, divide St. 
Petersburg among themselves... 
  [Kramarev] At one time "Lt. Shmidt's sons" divided all of 
Russia among themselves. Well, the country kept living and did 
not know anything about that. The conflicts, as a rule, occur 
because of a single item -- a cafe, for example, is divided up, 
or the two sides cannot come to any understanding as to who will 
be in charge of the prostitutes at a hotel. It is completely 
possible that the clarification of this kind of relationship can 
end in crossfire -- the number of weapons in people's hands has 
truly become very large. 
  But the thing that troubles me most is the increase in the 
number of domestic murders. Sometimes one gets the impression 
that people are simply becoming wild. No one would mind if 
people simply got into fist fights -- that's a tradition in 
Russia. But today people fight in such a way that four people 
end up dead. That never used to happen. 
  It must be admitted that we have somewhat eased up on the 
measures to prevent domestic crimes. But it's hard to do this 
under the present conditions. The previous methods don't work. 
Previously, if a person terrorized a woman in a communal 
apartment, a militiaman from the precinct could go to see that 
person, have a talk with him, and, if worse came to worst, he 
could threaten him with an article [in the criminal code] for 
parasitism or send him to an LTP [corrective labor camp]. Today 
you're lucky if you get out of that apartment alive. 
  [Potapenko] Is it possible that something that will become 
one of the elements of this preventive work will be the return 
of militia details to the streets or the resurrection of 
volunteer druzhinas, although, of course, on a 
different basis than previously? 
  [Kramarev] The militia has never left the streets. 
Especially 
in the rayons with the highest crime rate. We have begun making 
it a practice to carry out quick-response investigative 
operations, with the involvement of all the services. We 
mobilize all our barbers and clerks out onto the streets. An 
operation like this was recently carried out in 
Krasnogvardeyskiy Rayon. During a ten-day period 112 crimes were 
disclosed there, and street crime was cut in half. 
  As for druzhinas, they never did work, and that is 
why they were disbanded. Currently we are attempting to create 
combat-ready detachments. We will pay them, although not much. 
They will probably be organized on a territorial basis. A person 
will be more eager to protect the rayon where his family lives, 
and where his children go to school. It is possible to organize 
from among taxi drivers a mobile group that guarantees the 
safety of other drivers. It is necessary to make more dynamic 
use of such a force as the Cossacks -- there are still two 
Cossack villages in St. Petersburg. 
  [Potapenko] The most notorious criminal cases are occurring 
today in the economic sphere. The only thing one hears is 
corruption, bribery, and smuggling. Will the Main Administration 
be able to react adequately? 
  [Kramarev] Last year departments to counteract corruption 
and 
counterfeiters and to combat thefts of strategic resources were 
created within the Administration to Combat Economic Crimes. 
During the year 106 instances of bribery, 14 instances of 
smuggling, and 255 instances of manufacture and sale of 
counterfeit banknotes were revealed. It is a complicated matter 
to reveal economic crimes. Sociologists assert that, out of the 
total number of bribe-takers, it is possible to expose two or 
three percent. It is another matter that we have a data bank of 
information on corrupted officials in the system of the agencies 
of authority and management. We will catch these people sometime. 
  [Potapenko] In what structures do you think bribery is most 
widely developed? 
  [Kramarev] Listen, if 97 percent are in complete fog, how 
can 
I answer? In those that have been uncovered, employees of the 
militia have been noted more frequently than others. But that 
does not mean that the militia is the leader in this regard. It 
is simply that they are closer to us and it is easier to catch 
them. 
  [Potapenko] There exists a widespread opinion that many 
ordinary militiamen are being practically maintained by 
commercial structures. It is easy to understand what feeds these 
rumors --one can frequently encounter a militiaman who is 
guarding a privately owned store. 
  [Kramarev] Every contract with commercial enterprises for a 
guard is under the rigid monitoring of the main administration. 
A special commission operates for this purpose. One of the 
mandatory conditions is that the work is performed during 
nonduty hours. In addition, the militia employee receives 
payment from his own leadership, rather than from the commercial 
establishments. Of course, in the ideal situation state 
employees should get money only from the state. But even the 
state, in its turn, should pay an official in such a way that he 
can live a normal life. 
  But if we are to return to what you called a widespread 
opinion, there is yet another explanation for that. Some time 
ago, one of the managers at the main administration had the 
habit, during his lunch break, of driving around to all the 
sales areas and observing the work performed by the guards. Very 
frequently he discovered people there who were wearing the 
militia uniform, but it turned out after the appropriate check 
that only one-third of them were our people. The others were 
employees of private guard agencies who had put on the militia 
uniform. 
  [Potapenko] Guard companies are another sign of the times. 
Has the GUVD [Main Administration of Internal Affairs] found a 
common language with them? 
  [Kramarev] There was a period when no one paid any attention 
to those structures. Today we are just beginning to establish 
smooth interactions, and have begun to issue licenses to them. 
But I shall state frankly that the hopes that they will help us 
to establish order are melting from day to day. Very frequently, 
even the most respectable ones prove to be mixed up in criminal 
misdeeds. 
  [Potapenko] Arkadiy Grigoryevich, why is it that the most 
important criminal cases, in which we are dealing with 
gangsterism or corruption in the highest echelons of power, are 
investigated so slowly, or simply "disintegrate" on the way to 
court? 
  [Kramarev] Our jurisprudence now contains laws that do not 
exist in any other country. Here is just one situation. When the 
investigation is actually completed, we acquaint the accused 
with all the materials pertaining to the case, where it is 
stated in detail which witness said what, what his home address 
and place of work are, how many children he has and what school 
they attend. The accused individual studies all of this 
diligently, sometimes for months (the law does not limit him in 
this regard). The next act in this farce is the official request 
by the defense to have the restrictive measures imposed on the 
accused changed to his signed agreement not to leave the city. 
And so suspects are frequently released even if they are accused 
of gangsterism. Should one be surprised that, when the case 
comes to court, the witnesses unanimously change their 
depositions, asserting that the investigative employees had 
exerted an influence on them? 
  All these problems are by no means infrequent. Because of 
them, a large number of criminals are avoiding justice today, 
and those who are still free are flaunting their impunity. 
Politicians, if they want to curb crime successfully, must think 
seriously about this. 
  [Potapenko] At one time, after closing political agencies, 
the militia proclaimed its independence from ideological 
predilections. Are you being successful today in remaining aloof 
from political intrigues? 
  [Kramarev] Politics today is interfering in our life in an 
intermediated manner, giving rise to various social situations. 
The militia is no longer required, say, to chase away Communists 
or Democrats. Incidentally, new misfortunes have appeared, as 
Comrade Basilashvili said recently in the House of Cinema: 
"Fascists are walking along the streets, but Kramarev, with a 
cynical smile, assures us that everything in the city is all 
right." Yes, it's all right! Because while they are walking, the 
citizens have nothing to be afraid of. But it is really very 
simple to provoke gunfire. Among other things, when, in October 
of last year, riots began in Moscow, it was only with a great 
amount of work that we managed here to refrain people from using 
the same methods. Without a doubt, this was primarily thanks to 
the common sense of the St. Petersburgers -- the mentality of 
our residents is still somewhat different from that in the 
capital. But even the militia during those days displayed the 
maximum amount of restraint and patience, and that was, I 
repeat, no simple matter, and the situation at one time was 
hanging by a thread. But the people standing in the cordon are 
not made of iron. Some of the guys are 18 or 19 years of age, 
and when people spit at them and shout, "You fascist son of a 
bitch!, it takes a lot of bravery not to answer them. 
  [Potapenko] In six months the Goodwill Games will open in 
the 
city. How is the militia preparing for these events? 
  [Kramarev] The thing we are most afraid of is mass riots. 
Unfortunately, our people are not becoming more law-abiding. 
Rather, it is just the opposite. And if, in decorous Europe, a 
soccer match can end by having people set fire to automobiles 
and break windows in an entire section of the city, what can we 
say about our own country? 
  We are already taking steps today: Moscow will be allocating 
additional funds to us and will be sending people to work with 
us. We will come to an understanding with the military. They 
will help us, and we will put the students in our military 
schools on guard. On the whole, we will mobilize all our forces, 
inasmuch as fears do exist, and they are not without 
substantiation. A very complicated time was chosen for such mass 
measures. 
  Incidentally, who knows whether, possibly, it will be just 
the opposite, and the beautiful spectacle will create a good 
mood in people. It will reduce people's aggressiveness and, in 
general, will have a beneficial effect on society. God willing!

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anatoliy Sobchak Decided To Hold </F>
Elections to City Assembly in Two Rounds"] 
  [Text] Elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly will 
be held in two rounds. This is the main news following from 
Decree No. 131-r of the St. Petersburg Mayor. On 16 February 
Anatoliy Sobchak made new changes in and additions to the 
Statute of Elections to the City Assembly he had authored. 
  In the event more than two candidates are on the ballot in 
an 
electoral district and none is elected (that is, does not get 
more than 50 percent of the ballots cast by the voters 
participating in the elections), the city electoral commission 
must make a decision on holding a runoff election in the 
district, placing on the ballot the two candidates who received 
the greatest number of votes. The runoff election is held no 
later than two weeks after the first round. The candidate who 
receives the greater number of ballots cast by the voters 
participating in the elections is considered elected. 
  Elections are considered invalid if the number of valid 
ballots is less than 25 percent of the number of eligible 
voters, as well as in the event no more than two candidates were 
on the ballot in the district and neither was elected. 
  In addition, Sobchak made an amendment to Point 4 of Article 
2 of the statute, bringing it into compliance with the Russian 
Constitution. Let us recall that in keeping with this point, 
members of the Federal Assembly could not be elected to the 
assembly, while the Constitution applies this prohibition only 
to State Duma deputies but not to members of the Federation 
Council, who carry out their duties on a part-time basis. The 
ban on Federation Council members' becoming assembly deputies 
was the subject of a complaint by the former city soviet 
chairman, Aleksandr Belyayev, which is currently being 
considered by the city court. 
  By making changes in the statute on elections, the mayor 
partially took into account the pertinent suggestions of the 
electoral coalitions. The two-round election system will allow 
to avoid the incidents that occurred in the course of elections 
to the Federal Assembly.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova: "The Decline of </F>
Romanticism: Nomination of Candidates to the City Assembly Ends 
Today"] 
  [Text] The rules of the game set by the mayoralty 
made contenders for the mandates face an even more formidable 
task than during the elections to the Federal Assembly. Two 
thousand signatures for an independent candidate without 
guaranteed free advertising--this barrier is very hard to break 
through. For electoral coalitions the rules are more lenient. 
Having collected 35,000 signatures, they can nominate candidates 
in all 50 districts and on top of that reshuffle them until the 
last moment, searching for the most winnable district for each. 
In addition, there is the opportunity to hold press conferences 
to make oneself and one's position known. It is no wonder the 
idea of a coalition has become extremely attractive. 
Registration applications were received from 38 blocs; 34 of 
them were granted the right to enter the electoral race; 24 
realistically began signature collection. The big question is 
how many will make it to the finish line. 
  It is already clear, however, that the romanticism of the 
elections-90 is a thing of the past. No more boys with fiery 
eyes willing to distribute leaflets for free around the clock. 
Now agitators ask: How much? I was at the electoral commission 
when they received a call from a woman who wanted information on 
some bloc needing help. "What kind of bloc?" commission members 
asked. "Democratic? Communist?"--"It does not matter. Whoever 
pays more." Professional signature collectors get paid 400-500 
rubles [R] for each signature. In principle, there is nothing 
shameful in this--work has to be paid for. Except that not all 
of them can find R17 million. 
  Directors of major enterprises can also help in signature 
collection. Practically all the coalitions vied for their 
support and, again, there is nothing shameful here. But suppose 
all directors running in the elections suddenly win their 
mandates--the future assembly will look suspiciously like a 
meeting of party and economic activists. 
  We have a lot of parties. Good and bad, big and small. 
  There are some who think that the proposed mechanism of 
nominating candidates stimulates the creation of large viable 
organizations. Alas, in reality it only stands in the way of 
their emergence. Some wanted to find sponsors; others wanted to 
expand their electorate; in the end, however, most blocs' lists 
resemble a Noah's Arc, with a pair of each creature. And it is 
naive to assume that after the elections they will live in peace 
and accord, remembering their joint programs. But even during 
the period of signature collection the eclectic nature of the 
lists has not brought about the desired effect. A politically 
aware voter would find a name of one candidate whom for some 
reason he did not like and--goodbye. A politically unaware voter 
says goodbye much faster and not always politely... 
  The growing passivity became noticeable back in December. 
Today it is manifesting itself to the fullest extent. Most of 
the coalitions insisted on--and got--changes in the statute on 
elections: They will be conducted in two rounds. This is good, 
because it precludes the possibility of splitting the vote 
between candidates with similar programs. On the other hand, 
sociologists are sounding the alarm: A runoff election may not 
take place at all. "Why do we need it, this assembly?" many 
people ask. March 1990 was a time of hope. Placing our faith in 
the omnipotence of the deputies, we expected of them much more 
than they could realistically deliver. Much less is expected of 
the current ones. 
  This is a good time to remember, however, that St. 
Petersburg 
is a component of the Russian Federation. In keeping with the 
Federation Treaty, on a score of vitally important issues the 
Russian parliament can only adopt basic legislation, leaving the 
regions the opportunity to finalize it with local conditions in 
mind. Many matters have been placed completely within the 
competence of Federation components, and local laws need to be 
adopted on them. In addition, it is necessary to make 
adjustments to the existing regulations regarding disposal of 
land and municipal property and monitor compliance. There is 
also control over execution of the budget. Dozens of sore issues 
are awaiting resolution, and the latter depends on who comes to 
the assembly. 
  I hear sometimes: "Well, let the mayoralty do everything and 
bear responsibility for everything." These are rather utopian 
hopes. As already mentioned, a considerable number of norms and 
rules must be established here, in the city. Are we to allow the 
executive branch to set them for itself and then oversee itself 
on compliance? Or hope that there will be a wise King Solomon on 
each committee, who will resolve disputes fairly? The ability to 
dispose of property at one's own discretion at best leads to 
bias: Whoever they like more will get it. And practically always 
the result is a loss for the city budget, which is already full 
of holes. 
  It appears that the traditional Russian maximalism is 
raising 
its head again. While calling the mean golden, we gravitate to 
extremes. One gets the impression that we have perceived the 
idea of a democratic reorganization of society as a sort of 
revelation that will allow us to build paradise on earth in the 
shortest of time. This did not happen--disenchantment sets in. 
And there is a real danger that the romantic democratism of the 
late 1980's will be replaced by equally romantic 
national-authoritarianism... In this sense it is not bad perhaps 
that we do not look at our future deputies as saviors: This 
makes it probable that we will elect not demagogues but people 
who are willing to move toward the goal in small steps, and 
engage in painstaking work. Of course, drafting laws is not a 
romantic business. But this is precisely what we need today. 
Otherwise we will not be able to either lay a foundation for the 
new system of city administration or escape great cataclysms.

<F P=106> [Report by Zoya Shpanko: "Half a Million--Is It a Lot or a </F>
Little?"] 
  [Text] There may be up to half a million unemployed 
in St. Petersburg soon--this is the forecast of First Deputy 
Mayor Dmitriy Sergeyev, who spoke yesterday at the Palace of 
Labor. The palace was the site of a conference with the 
participation of mayoralty representatives, the city's Trade 
Union Federation, heads of rayon administrations, enterprise 
directors, and representatives of rayon employment centers. 
  Such a development of events is possible if prices for fuel 
and power continue to rise, resulting in mass bankruptcy of 
enterprises. Alas, the maximum number of unemployed the city 
employment fund can handle is 150,000-160,000. 
  According to Dmitriy Cherneyko, chairman of the mayoralty's 
committee on employment, seasonal work is unlikely to provide 
solution to the unemployment problem. For instance, last year 
there were no requests in Leningrad Oblast for the labor of 
student construction brigades. 
  Trade unions took a rather tough position on the issue of 
employment. As the chairman of the Trade Union Federation of 
Petersburg and the Oblast put it, trade unions do not care why 
people become unemployed. According to the estimates of 
international experts, the number of unemployed in our city 
exceeds the official figures by a factor of three. Only a 
regional employment program, which will envisage well-considered 
conversion, small business development, and seasonal works, can 
change the situation. 
  The conference adopted a resolution. One of its points 
instructs the economic development committee jointly with the 
finance committee to look into the issue of targeted 
appropriation to support socially significant enterprises.

"Belyayev Defends the Mayor. From Sobchak"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the city court considered a claim of the 
former city soviet chairman Aleksandr Belyayev, who is 
challenging the legality of a number of articles in the statute 
on elections, which bars him, as a Federation Council member, 
from being elected to the city assembly. The case never got to 
the point of argument: At the very beginning of the hearings 
Aleksandr Komarov, deputy chief of the mayoralty's legal 
department, handed the court Anatoliy Sobchak's new decree, 
which eliminates Federation Council deputies from the 
"blacklist." 
  The litigation between Belyayev and Sobchak did not end 
there, however. On 23 February the court will consider a new 
claim from Aleksandr Nikolayevich which challenges the statute's 
legality regarding introducing the residency and age minimum for 
candidates, as well as banning MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] personnel, fixed-term military servicemen, the mayor, 
the vice mayor, and deputy mayors from running for deputy seats. 
Commenting on the situation, he remarked that the mayor is not 
necessarily Sobchak but merely an official. Aleksandr Belyayev 
is against electing bureaucrats to the city assembly, but he 
believes that such a ban must be reinforced by federal law or at 
least a presidential edict. Meanwhile, on 22 January Boris 
Yeltsin repealed the point in the "Law on Kray and Oblast 
Soviet..." that barred heads of the executive branch from 
becoming deputies. As to the ban on MVD personnel and military 
servicemen on running for deputy seats, in the opinion of 
Belyayev and his representative, this simply violates the 
current law.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Zolotonosov: "A Carefully Selected Fifth </F>
Class"] 
  [Text] Judging by the fact that on the day of the so-called 
"communications workers strike" Channel 5 was operating as 
usual, communications workers in Petersburg had received payment 
due from their television center on time. This is good, of 
course. But this also leads one to assume that Channel 5 
management has some special ways of getting money. 
And having made this assumption, one simply has to go one step 
further in this reasoning. 
  The impression came through as early as 1990 (and 
intensified 
as years went by) that it was thanks to Kurkova and Channel 5 
that Boris Nikolayevich became chairman of the RSFSR Supreme 
Soviet; that it was specifically for Kurkova's live 
broadcasts that Yeltsin was coming to Leningrad to speak to 
the people. Since it is hard to suspect Yeltsin of ingratitude, 
one has to advance the hypothesis that his kindness toward 
Kurkova continues to this day--when the decline in the quality 
of Channel 5 broadcasting has reached catastrophic proportions, 
and the question of removing the chairman could not fail to come 
up, among other reasons because of the precarious decline in 
Petersburg TV ratings. But since B. Kurkova continues on her 
job, even under these circumstances, and does not let go of the 
microphone, one is left with an assumption that the Boss, not 
knowing how events will be developing, whether he will run in 
presidential elections in 1996, and in whose favor the odds will 
be tilting, may be using the same logic as Emperor Paul I in the 
short story "Second Lieutenant Kizhe": "We should hold off 
burdening him with a division. He is needed for more important 
things." That is: do not promote, do not transfer to Moscow; she 
will still be needed in Petersburg, right there at Channel 5. 
  Apparently for the same reason the "maker of politicians" 
and 
"charisma-builder" is permitted to sit in two "cushy chairs" 
simultaneously: She is also the chairman of the St. Petersburg 
board of directors within the All-Russia State Television and 
Radio Company, a de facto first deputy to Oleg Poptsov. Only old 
comrades-in-battle are rewarded this generously. By the way, I 
am curious: Can one state employee be the head of two state 
organizations at the same time? 
  We also have to take into account one more important person 
in this story--Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. Judging by all the signs, 
what we now have in St. Petersburg is a mutually beneficial 
alliance of the executive and the monopolized TV power, as a 
result of which any criticism of Sobchak's actions is completely 
absent from television. 
  Judging by what we see one may assume that Kurkova's power 
is 
practically absolute, and therefore Channel 5 has become a 
precise reflection of political, professional, and esthetic 
views of the director and the chairman of the board. It is 
obvious that in both her own broadcasts and those of her 
subordinates Kurkova cares only about political 
content, interpreted as tendentious support of specific 
persons (not economic or political ideas but exactly 
that--persons!). The emphasis on propaganda has 
displaced even hints at analysis: The style of the 
"Fifth Wheel" in the late 1980's, when the "talking heads" 
anticommunist monologue made a sensation in both capitals, now 
has become a model for all of Channel 5. The only difference 
being that no sensations are possible now, since the trick 
outlived itself "one lifetime ago." As to analytical coverage, 
this issue has been resolved in a cardinal manner. To interpret 
"something political," they invite politicians (A. Sobchak, A. 
Belyayev); when all else fails, the job is entrusted to B. 
Kurkova and her deputy V. Pravdyuk. 
  From the above follows the esthetic side: A strong 
provincial 
flavor, most noticeable in the absence of modern computer 
graphics; programs existing outside of time and rhythm; the 
absence of necessary components of artistic form--from an 
inventive script to a decent studio interior. Petersburg TV is 
the least attractive of all Russian television facilities. It 
appears that this is of no concern to the leadership, while in 
the absence of excitement everything deteriorates--moving toward 
the absence of style, form, and expression. Moreover, everything 
is done to make the ugliness prominent, for which purpose 
Channel 5 continues to broadcast NTV programs ("Itogi," 
"Segodnya," "Namedni") against whose background its own product 
looks even more miserable. 
  The absence of editing, rhythm, and direction on the whole 
had been felt even in "Fifth Wheel." But at the time this was 
explained by the topicality of struggle against communism, 
which--in order to prevent interference of oblast party 
committee censors--carefully observed the three classic 
postulates of unity: place, time, and action. In order to 
prevent any sort of cuts, editing was abolished. Now this has 
become Channel 5's main esthetic principle--the principle 
of classic amateur performance, which manifests itself 
especially graphically in live broadcasts: direction is still 
confused with censorship, and therefore what is valued most is a 
complete absence of any artistic interference. As a 
result of the absence of direction, mise en scene is formed 
"naturally": of the simplest combination of three 
components--the camera, the anchor, and the speaker. This set of 
components permits making broadcasts of any length 
without expending any effort; in addition, the anchor does not 
so much ask questions as sit as a "battle complement" next to 
the speaker (Kurkova's favorite state on camera when she 
"interviews" someone). 
  A typical program is "Itogi XX Veka" ("Summarizing the 
Twentieth Century"): The "speaking man" is seated; the camera is 
in front of him (only two angles are used), and a monologue 
calmly continues for an hour! From time to time the "radio text" 
is interrupted by a "video clip" that is only remotely related 
to the topic. 
  There are, actually, wilder programs as well, for instance, 
the fun "Weather-Show": Two mummers sit by samovar--a boy of 
about 10 and a middle-aged man. The task of this "creative 
collective" is to wedge the weather forecast into a 
"fun" conversation. It is not quite clear why all of this is 
needed. Nevertheless, the boy asks the man: What would be your 
last words before execution? To which the man, without blinking 
an eye, answers: "Good-bye, Central Russia! Where, by the way, 
minus 15 degrees is expected tomorrow..." Then the same man in 
Lenin's voice (!) relates the weather forecast for Arkhangelsk 
and Murmansk Oblasts. To make it really funny, the man calls the 
boy by name and patronymic... The lack of which technique can 
explain this flight of creative imagination? 
  Toward the end of the 19th-beginning of the 20th Century the 
profession of theatrical director emerged in the European 
theater so that a stage show would not be a mere "sound track" 
of the script but expressed a certain directorial concept of the 
man and the world. A director became the show's creator and 
organizer, and a synthetic image began to express some new 
contents. Keeping in mind the specificity of directorial 
profession one may guess why Petersburg TV lacks directors and 
editors. It is apparently better and safer not to have people 
around who have fantasy, concepts, and an ability for 
independent creative activities. It is safer politically, but 
this also results in most regular programs being shapeless and 
not put together: from the boring "Sunday Labyrinth" to 
"Zebra"--a television version of the "Young Pioneer Sunrise." 
  Somehow the phenomenon of editing and the effects 
produced by it has bypassed Petersburg television producers; for 
this reason I can recommend Mikhail Yampolskiy's compendium 
"Editing" as required reading in "all the companies, squadrons, 
and ships" on Channel 5. Neither would it hurt to read up on Lev 
Kuleshov and Sergey Eisenstein... I have no right to insist on 
it, however. 
  The abundance of boring conversation and the shortage of 
well 
put-together stories at this point is counterbalanced, in my 
opinion, only by the "Tele-Store." Following in the footsteps of 
Russian futurist Ilya Zdanevich, the program contends that an 
American shoe is more beautiful than the Venus de Milo. The 
five-minute-long advertising display of expensive consumer goods 
is the only program where the image on the screen is in harmony 
with the text, while the short length of the show does not give 
the viewer enough time to wallow in envy. There is also a 
pleasant anchor, who combines provincial shyness with the 
ingenuity of a beginner stockbroker. Nika, the anchor of another 
program, also is a feast for the eye. Provided one watches her 
program with the sound turned off.
